40|$|The {{foundation}} of language teaching has undergone many changes. The {{rise and fall}} of language teaching methods depends upon a variety of factors extrinsic to a method itself and often reflects the influence of profit-seekers and promoters, as well as the forces of the intellectual marketplace. There was always a source of contention among people that what the secret of a method life is. In this paper, the writer investigated why once have various teaching methods come into vogue and then disappeared? Some contradicted the method, while others came to provide a complementary view. The writer with a critical lens questioned the concept of <b>post-method</b> which qualitatively, as Akbari (2008) held, is not that much different from the term method. Furthermore, the author claimed the concept of <b>post-method</b> is not plausible by novice teachers. For the fulfillment of <b>post-method</b> perspectives, the whole system must be touched upon, not just a teacher as the key feature of post method. And if it is said there should be an attempt to find an alternative to method, is it really logical to imagine that even a novice teacher must seek for it? The one who first must be provided with some packages of principles in order to begin his teaching job? There is not a place to discuss whether a teacher should adopt a method or not, but what is plausible is that method is always present everywhere even {{in the body of the}} phrase like <b>post-method.</b> The writer, in the paper, attempted to shed lights into the concept of methods, beyond methods, <b>post-method</b> and, in a nutshell, what is going on in the history of language teaching. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With the {{transformation}} of English as an International language, the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) industry – from researcher to publisher to teacher – is burgeoning. However, as globalization deterritorializes English from native speak-ing peoples and places and thus necessitates a Non-Native Speaker (NNS) English Language Teacher population greatly out-numbering the Native Speaker (NS) one, the EFL industry has entered into a foggy <b>post-methods</b> era in which both the stan-dards defining English as a language to be taught, and {{how it should be}} taught, are being contested in both English and non-English speaking countries alike. The deterritorialization of English and the massive population of NNS EFL teachers, how-ever, are also the conditions that point towards a solution to the pedagogical contentions: a principled pragmatism that encour-ages a convergence of “foreign ” and local EFL pedagogies is starting to emerge...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: After voicing {{repeated}} {{dissatisfaction with}} the concept of methods and number of reactions against the models of teacher education, a great need to have a new trend in language teaching was felt and caused to construct a <b>post-method</b> pedagogy. The post method pedagogy explores the instructional means for real life communication in the L 2 classroom, getting the learners not just to develop linguistic accuracy, but expand their fluency. So, modern teacher training programs have been shifting towards <b>post-method</b> theories and methodologies that define new patterns of relationship between teachers and theorizers by pushing them towards the world of skills, knowledge, and autonomy. In this regard, recently, the field of EFL / ESL has begun to recognize the importance of exploring the cognitive dimensions of how language teachers ' education, thoughts, judgments, and decisions influence the nature of their language instructions. Accordingly, {{the purpose of the present}} study is to explore whether the EFL secondary and high school teachers ’ theoretical knowledge about <b>post-method</b> pedagogy has been put into practice.

40|$|This paper {{contends that}} English {{as a foreign}} {{language}} teaching in the classrooms at all the levels of education is not adapted to the everyday communication needs of the Cameroonian learners and that an English language pedagogy of integration; otherwise known as the outcomes approach or the competency based approach can solve the problem. This approach seeks for linguistic and sociolinguistic competence in the language. In fact, walls seem to exist between the knowledge these learners get in the classrooms and {{the implementation of the}} knowledge in the real world society for which that knowledge is destined. Literature in the domain of attitudes and motivation shows that they are affectively predisposed to learn the language. A critical examination of the syllabus revealed that it spells out laudable learning outcomes or expectations and that it has adequate communicative approach recommendations for a <b>post-methods</b> era English language teacher.

40|$|Do methods {{still have}} a place in 21 " century {{language}} teaching? To answer this question, an international survey was conducted in the surnmer of 1999. A sample of 800 language teachers world-wide randomly drawn from 17, 800 TESOLers were each given a 2 -page survey. The return rate was 58. 5 % with the actual usable data set of 448, which was analyzed by using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Among the ten commonly recognized teaching methods surveyed, both the Communicative Language Teaching Approach and an eclectic method seem to have the highest rate in familiarity, preference, and use. But when multiple factors, such as teaching contexts, instructional settings, learners' proficiency levels, class size, teaching experience and educational backgrounds of the teachers, and the status of being a native or nonnative English speaking professional were taken into consideration, various patterns and themes emerged. One interesting finding is that Grammar Translation is still used in EFL contexts, in larger classes, and with learners at low proficiency levels, though the ratio between the actual use of this method and teachers' preference does not match. Based on the results of the survey, a new theoretical framework is proposed to conceptualize language teaching methods in the <b>post-methods</b> era...|$|R
40|$|Foreign {{language}} teaching undergoes constant changes {{due to the}} methodological improvement. This progress may be examined in two parts. They are the methods era and the <b>post-methods</b> era. It is not pragmatic today to propose a particular {{language teaching}} method and its techniques for all purposes. The holistic inflexibility of mid-century methods has long gone. In the present day, constructivist foreign language teaching trends attempt to see the learner as a whole person and an individual who may {{be different from the}} other students in many respects. At the same time, the individual differences should not keep the learners away from group harmony. For this reason, current teacher training programs require eclectic teaching matrixes for unit design considering the mixed ability student groups. These matrixes can be prepared in a multidimensional fashion because there are many functional techniques in different methods and other new techniques to be created by instructors freely in accordance with the teaching aims. The hypothesis in this argument is that the collection of foreign language teaching techniques compiled in ELT microteachings for a particular group of learners has to be arranged eclectically in order to update the teaching process. Nevertheless, designing a teaching format of this sort is a demanding and highly criticized task. This study briefly argues eclecticism in language-skills based methodological struggle from the perspective of ELT teacher education...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{submitted}} in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Arts in English, 2011. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis. Includes bibliographical references (page 57 - 59). This study {{is concerned with the}} existing methods and approaches that are in action at the tertiary level. It attempts to assess the suitability of the current methods that are used in different private universities of Dhaka from the perspective of <b>post-methods.</b> In the postmethod era, the traditional methods/approaches are thought to be dead, and a method is only considered suitable when it is context sensitive. Our learners, even after studying English for twelve years, fail to acquire sufficient mastery over English. This may happen because of the somewhat inappropriate choice of methods by the teachers. Many a times, teachers of our country execute a given method without judging the context. As a result, a mismatch between the context and the method being implemented becomes obvious and when the learners come to a university, the mismatch may continue. This study aims to see the present situation and suitability of the methods implemented at tertiary level. In other words, the study aims {{to find out if the}} methods are context sensitive. It will provide future researchers a good understanding of the conditions of different methods and approaches. The results of this study can be used to make necessary modifications and enhancements in those approaches. The study uses interviews (semi-structured) to collect data. The findings show that the teachers of private universities in Dhaka make a conscious effort to contextualize features of different methods and approaches and implement them accordingly. At the same time, the teachers need to be aware of a few key issues which the researcher discussed as recommendations, for example, the status of English in Bangladesh, need for local materials, need for "needs analysis" etc. to improve the teaching standard of English of the private universities of Dhaka.

40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on the origin and {{definition}} of the communicative language teaching (CLT) approach as well as its major criticisms. The study aims at examination of typical features of CLT to establish the reason why none of the methods or approaches so far has come to replace it; whether it is plausible to suggest that any such method or approach will appear in the future; whether it is possible to describe the current situation as <b>post-method.</b> In order to achieve this goal strengths and weaknesses of the CLT approach have been scrutinised and its influence on the present day <b>post-method</b> state has been explored. The authors state that in spite of all criticisms, CLT has a great impact in the present teaching context. Having given special attention to the description of post methods pedagogy, it is obvious that this condition may be considered as a consequent stage, which has emerged as a result of CLT breakdown.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of endangered language learners range from infants to elders, and from proficient speakers acquiring literacy to complete beginners, with {{all levels of}} linguistic competence in between. This paper discusses the need for careful consideration of learner and context characteristics, and presents two complementary frameworks that support teachers in making detailed assessments of the linguistic resources that learners possess, while avoiding the common trap of categorizing learners through deficit perspectives and perpetuating exclusionary education dynamics. The <b>post-method</b> movement in language teaching (Pennycook, 1989; Kumaravadivelu 1994, 2006) offers guidance for teachers facing the need to adapt their practice to learner's diverse linguistic repertoires, expectations, and {{to a range of}} education environments. Beginning with awareness of the socio-cultural context, this framework emphasizes the need to validate teachers in the creation of their own uniquely-appropriate practices, rather than fostering dependence on methods and materials prescribed from outside experts. Foreign and second language teaching methods generally fall far short of meeting the expectations or needs of endangered language learners (Hinton, 2001), and thus teachers need to be equipped to use them flexibly and to innovate in context-appropriate ways. The framework of communicative repertoires (Gumperz & Hymes, 1964; Rymes 2013) can assist teachers in the task of recognizing each learner's receptive and productive language capacities, focusing on the linguistic resources that learners possess, rather than the more common perspective that frames learners as deficient in relation to the target speaker norm. This framework can also help to identify concrete communication goals, and measure linguistic competence achieved. In addition to supporting awareness of learner characteristics and encouraging context-specific innovation, the <b>post-method</b> approach also attends to the potential of language education to highlight and address issues of social inequality. Social power dynamics are significant in all contexts of language education (Tollefson, 1991; Norton, 2000), however it is especially important to consider these factors when working with learners and languages that have in many cases been (or continue to be) subjected to prejudice and hostility through formal education. The <b>post-method</b> approach is thus particularly appropriate for practitioners of endangered language education, allowing for consideration of social factors, attention to learner's communicative repertoires, and active recognition of the many resources available for building successful communication and successful communities of learners.

Finally, we propose a reflection to the classroom, from a point of view in which language is discourse, (JORDÃO, 2006, 2007, 2013; KRAMSCH, 1998, 2008 a, 2008 b, 2012, 2013) in order to make students aware of their own and other people’s cultural issues and have a ressignified perspective.

With regard to this trend, the researcher particularly focuses on its two main responses to the SLT Dilemma chronologically listed as: Kumaravadivelu's (1994) "post-method pedagogy" and Larsen-Freeman's (1999) "seven I's". The other theoretical trend expresses a neurolinguisticlly-oriented methodological reaction to the SLT Dilemma which is related to bimodality theory developed by Danesi (2003). The researcher endeavourers to delve into the tenets and principles of these three specific responses to come up with a clear understanding of them which may coherently highlight the two investigated theoretical trends toward the SLT Dilemma accordingly. To this end, the researcher examines the different dimensions of these responses with reference to the following two theoretical questions: (a) why have the pervious methods and approaches failed to tackle the SLT Dilemma?, (b) how can the SLT Dilemma be resolved? In light of such a rationale, the study might be able to compare and elucidate the two investigated theoretical trends and consequently, it might shed more light on the issue of SLT Dilemma from a scholarly outlook...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reports on}} a key conclusion drawn from a qualitative investigation based on semi-structured interviews and regarding “alternative” repertoires of qualitative research writing in the social sciences, as perceived by journal editors and leading researchers. Most of the conclusions situate themselves on either end of what seems a “scientific versus art-based” binary: at one end, defending the standardized research repertoire of nominalized, third-person, and authorially silent writing; or, at the other end, promoting the research repertoire of personalized, first-person, and literary-like writing. One conclusion, however, seems to occupy an approximate midpoint within this binary. This conclusion points to a research writing repertoire which can be called “referenced, reflective, and personally illustrative” (RRPI) whereby the author avoids discrete sections such as “analysis” and “discussion,” utilizes bibliographic referencing at will, and expresses her/his opinions, experiences, and personal examples. Not {{to be confused with}} current “essay-like” or “think piece writing,” RRPI research writing seems alternative and innovative because, as the data from the investigation shows, the authorial presence of RRPI becomes so pervasive that it becomes a type of empiricism onto itself, as if guided by unseen and unmentioned qualitative data such as interview transcripts or researcher diary entries. In other words, RRPI seems a <b>post-method</b> or post-data research writing repertoire in qualitative studies. This leads us to consider RRPI as a repertoire that by mediating an apparent “scientific versus art-based” binary is able to communicate effectively and inclusively to its readership, including those participants who have informed its underlying data base...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{objective in}} <b>post-method</b> pedagogy is developing language learner’s communicative competence {{to enable them}} to participate in communication acts. Effective oral communication entails observation of a number of conversational principles and appropriate use of various strategies to avoid violation of mutually recognized rules, e. g. politeness strategies. Some researchers believe that politeness strategies have a number of universal Features (Goff man, 1967, 1971 : Goody, 1978 a). In line with previous research studies, the present study set out to investigate whether nationality would influence the use of request politeness strategies by Iranian and Turkish EFL learners at the same proficiency level. Participants in this study included 448 students at four different levels of proficiency who were majoring in English language teaching at Gazi University in turkey and Islamic Azad University – Tabriz Branch. 224 Turkish students at four different grade levels and the same number of Iranian students participated directly in this phase of the research. Each grade level group consisted of 56 students. The researcher administered a questionnaire enquiring their preferences in selecting the proper forms of requests (Blum - Kulka & Olshtain, 1985). The statistical analysis revealed a strong correlation in intra-groups while the inter – group results displayed relatively significant differences. The Turkish participants used request politeness strategies more appropriately than Iranians which support the role of culture in the use of such strategies. The findings highlight the necessity of observing cultural background in teaching communication strategies such as request politeness strategies particularly in EFL contexts...|$|E
