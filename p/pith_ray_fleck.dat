50|$|In this context, {{the term}} refers to radial sheets or ribbons {{extending}} vertically through the tree across and {{perpendicular to the}} growth rings. Also called <b>pith</b> <b>rays</b> or wood rays, these formations of primarily parenchyma cells allow the radial transport of sap and are essential {{in the process of}} tylosis.|$|R
50|$|Quarter-sawn boards {{have greater}} {{stability}} {{of form and}} size with less cupping, shrinkage across the width, shake and splitting, and other good qualities. In some woods, such as oak, the grain produces a decorative effect which shows a prominent <b>ray</b> <b>fleck</b> and sapele is likely to produce a ribbon figure.|$|R
50|$|It {{can grow}} from 40-90 {{feet high and}} from 2-3 feet in diameter. It yields very good timber {{that can be used}} for mill rollers, frames, furniture, and house building. Acana wood is light colored, fine and {{straight}} grained, hard, very heavy, strong, durable, and can be polished to shine. The pores are small and arranged in radial rows. <b>Pith</b> <b>rays</b> narrow and indistinct.|$|R
50|$|The company {{distinguished}} {{itself as}} a competitor {{for some of the}} better American pendulum clocks, such as those made by Seth Thomas. Their clocks often looked like models made by Seth Thomas or Sessions but some of their designs, especially the tall mantle clocks, were unique. For their wooden cases, they favored the heart wood of quarter-sawn white oak that showed off beautiful <b>ray</b> <b>flecks.</b> The designs often had elements of the Arts and Crafts Movement which also favored quarter-sawn white oak.|$|R
50|$|In {{their native}} habitat, they can grow tall, 40-60 metres, but rarely reach this in cultivation. The bases of large trees are usually {{prominently}} buttressed. Leaves with white or silver on underside. Argyrodendron actinophyllum and Argyrodendron trifoliolatum occur in scrubs and rainforests {{along the east}} coast of Australia, but Argyrodendron peralatum has a restricted distribution in north Queensland between Tully and Cooktown. The grain is usually straight and open, sometimes interlocked or wavy and irregular producing some beautifully figured wood. Attractive figure on tangential face and large <b>ray</b> <b>fleck</b> on radial face are prominent features of Argyrodendron wood.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe anatomy, palynology, {{morphology}} {{and distribution}} of the trichomes on the aerial parts of Salvia chrysophylla Stapf, an endemic species in Turkey, were studied {{in order to understand}} the usefulness of these characteristics for systematic purposes. Some anatomical characters such as (1 –) 2 – 24 -rowed <b>pith</b> <b>rays</b> in roots, dorsiventral leaves, obviously larger upper epidermal cells, and two to three large vascular bundles in the center and two to four small subsidiary bundles in the wings of petiole provide information of taxonomical significance. Three main types of trichomes were observed on the stem, inflorescence axis, leaf and calyx surfaces of S. chrysophylla. They are peltate, capitate glandular and non-glandular. Capitate glandular and non-glandular trichomes were further subdivided into several kinds. Glandular trichomes are present in abundance on the inflorescence axis and calyx, but non-glandular ones were mainly situated on the leaf and stem. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) studies on the pollen grains have revealed that they are oblate-spheroidal and their exine ornamentation is bireticulate-perforate...|$|R
40|$|Precipitation {{of calcium}} in plants is common. There are {{abundant}} {{studies on the}} uptake and content of magnesium, strontium and barium, which have similar chemical properties to calcium, in comparison with those of calcium in plants, but studies on co-precipitation of these elements with calcium in plants are rare. In this study, we compared morphologies, distributional patterns, and elemental compositions of crystals in tissues of four Acacia species grown in the field {{as well as in}} the glasshouse. A comparison was also made of field-grown plants and glasshouse-grown plants, and of phyllodes of different ages for each species. Crystals of various morphologies and distributional patterns were observed in the four Acacia species studied. Magnesium, strontium and barium were precipitated together with calcium, mainly in phyllodes of the four Acacia species, and sometimes in branchlets and primary roots. These elements were most likely precipitated in forms of oxalate and sulfate in various tissues, including epidermis, mesophyll, parenchyma, sclerenchyma (fibre cells), <b>pith,</b> <b>pith</b> <b>ray</b> and cortex. In most cases, precipitation of calcium, magnesium, strontium and barium was biologically induced, and elements precipitated differed between soil types, plant species, and tissues within an individual plant; the precipitation was also related to tissue age. Formation of crystals containing these elements might play a role in regulating and detoxifying these elements in plants, and protecting the plants against herbivory...|$|R
50|$|Quarter sawing {{gets its}} name {{from the fact that the}} log is first {{quartered}} lengthwise, resulting in wedges with a right angle ending at approximately the center of the original log. Each quarter is then cut separately by tipping it up on its point and sawing boards successively along the axis. That results in boards with the annual rings mostly perpendicular to the faces. Quarter sawing yields boards with straight striped grain lines, greater stability than flatsawn wood, and a distinctive <b>ray</b> and <b>fleck</b> figure. It also yields narrower boards, because the log is first quartered, which is more wasteful.|$|R
40|$|Background: Blepharis sindica – T. Anders {{of family}} Acanthaceae is an {{important}} medicinal plant which is mainly used as an invigorating tonic, given to cattle to increase milk production and its roots are used for urinary discharge and dysmenorrhea. It {{is commonly known as}} “Bhaṅgāī”. It is extensively used traditionally as Vāīkāraka and Vṛṣya (Aphrodisiac) by vaidyas of Rajasthan and Gujarat. The seeds of Blepharis sindica T. Anders are the parts of the plant valued for their medicinal value. Aims: The present investigation deals with the pharmacognostic studies of the root, stem, seed and seed powder. Materials and Methods: The study includes macroscopy, microscopy, preliminary phytochemical analysis and physicochemical evaluation using methods given in Indian Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia. Results: Physicochemical parameters such as total ash value, acid insoluble ash value and water soluble ash value were determined to be 21. 449 ౩ 2. 629 %w/w, 0. 986 %w/w, 18. 746 %w/w respectively. Preliminary phytochemical analysis of extracts were carried out. Different extracts contain carbohydrate, protein, alkaloids, phenols, saponins and steroids prominently. Calcium, zinc, potassium and iron were also present. These secondary metabolites are the active constituents and may be responsible for B. sindica's pharmacological activities. Chief characters of transverse section of stem include ringed vascular bundles, radial striped <b>pith</b> <b>rays</b> and parenchymal <b>pith.</b> Seed shows presence of scalariform tracheids and lignified walls. Conclusions: The result of the present study can be useful for the identification and preparation of a monograph of the plant...|$|R
50|$|Wind carries teliospores to pines shoots {{that then}} {{germinate}} under cool humid conditions, producing germ tubes {{with up to}} three side branches that act as basidia. The basidiam directly penetrate the cuticle and epidermis. Other pines rusts like cronartium ribicola and C. comandrae infect through the stomata. After penetration and establishment of a intracellular infection structure, primary hyphae are produced, infecting the epidermis and cortex intercellularly. Haustoria extend through neighboring cells and the cortex to reach the vascular cambium before the host becomes dormant follow the first infection season. The cambium is invade inwardly through the phloem and cortex, {{as opposed to a}} vertical or peripheral hyphael growth. Initiation of gall formation is through exogenous stimulation of the cambium and <b>pith</b> <b>rays,</b> causing an increased production of ray parenchyma. The host reacts by hyperplasia(increased division) providing the resources needed for further hyphae proliferation in the cortex, phloem, and cambium until the galls death. The gall will enlarge for 2 years and sporulate on the third. Spermogonia ooze from infected bark in early spring, but they are non-functional since they do not form aecia (vestigial). Dikaryotization of the haploid mycelium that produce the teliospores takes place in the outer cortex, just beneath the first periderm. They are surrounded by a membrane called a peridium that bursts, releasing the spores. Stimulation of dikaryotization is not understood, though it is likely a combination of host sap flow and environmental cues.|$|R
50|$|Amish {{furniture}} {{is made with}} a variety of quality hardwoods including northern red oak, quarter-sawn white oak, cherry, maple, beech, elm, mahogany, walnut, hickory, cedar, and pine. Northern red oak is a very popular choice for American consumers for its warmth, color, and durability. It is typically grown in Eastern U.S., particularly in the Appalachian Mountains. White oak is slightly harder than red oak and can be cut to show more <b>ray</b> <b>fleck.</b> The antique look of white oak makes it ideal for Mission and Shaker styles. Cherry has a light reddish-brown color that will darken with light exposure. Maple wood offers a spectrum of beauty from different angles. It is significantly harder than oak and is growing in popularity because of its beauty. American beech is white with a red tinge and bends readily when steamed. Elm ranges in color from nearly white to brown with a red tinge and is fairly stiff and heavy. Mahogany is typically used in high-class furnishings because of its attractive finish. As mahogany matures its color varies from yellowish or pinkish to deep red or brown. Walnut is heavy, hard, and stiff and ranges in color from nearly white in the sapwood to dark brown in the heartwood. Walnut holds stain, paint, and polish well. Hickory is harder than oak and distinguished by extreme contrasts of light and dark colors. Hickory’s sapwood is a creamy white while hickory’s heartwood is a red, pink or reddish-brown color and often referred to as red hickory. Cedar has a deep rosy glow and stripes of light golden sapwood. Eastern white pine is a soft wood. It tends to have more knots than a hardwood and can yellow with age.|$|R

40|$|Wood {{anatomy of}} nonarboreal Scrophulariaceae is little studied, yet such {{information}} {{is needed to}} understand the evolution of woodiness {{in the family and}} order. Description and quantification of wood characters of six species (nine taxa) of Penstemon subgenus Saccanthera show that these woods are specialized. Paedomorphic features include the standard declining-to-level curve of vessel element length by age, and (in several samples) a pronounced tendency to raylessness. Variation in ray characteristics is as great within as between species, suggesting that unsampled populational variation in ray characteristics may be present. Cells intermediate between fibers and nonseptate parenchyma are present and complement the biseriate strands of axial parenchyma. Storying of cambia is found in two species. Crystal presence is erratic; when present, crystals are restricted to <b>pith</b> and <b>rays.</b> Interpreting the paedomorphic origin of the woody habit in Penstemon as an example of heterochrony suggests that comparative life-history and resource-allocation studies may provide powerful tools for placing woodiness in an ecological and evolutionary context in this complex genus...|$|R
30|$|Focussing on {{four types}} of {{parenchyma}} cell around pith regions of branches of Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis, we examined the timing and role of cell death during heartwood formation. Large parenchyma cells that were located in the inner part of the pith died within a year. By contrast, other parenchyma cells died within 4  years, with the timing of cell death {{depending on the type}} of cell. Axial parenchyma cells of the xylem close to the pith died first. Then, small parenchyma cells died in the perimedullary zone in the outer part of the <b>pith.</b> Finally, <b>ray</b> parenchyma cells in the xylem close to the pith died. Variations in the autofluorescence of cell walls, which might have been due to deposition of heartwood substances, were observed first in xylem ray parenchyma cells and small parenchyma cells in the perimedullary zone. Our results indicate that the initiation of heartwood formation occurs within 4  years in pith regions of branches in Robinia pseudoacacia L. var. inermis. Moreover, it appears that not only xylem ray parenchyma cells but also small parenchyma cells in the perimedullary zone might be involved in the synthesis of heartwood substances.|$|R
40|$|Examination of {{leaf and}} stem tissues {{in a broad}} range of genera {{resulted}} in the discovery and analysis of a novel tracheid type termed Wide-Band Tracheids (WBTs; the term is derived from the comparatively wide secondary wall) in derived genera of Aizoaceae, Cactaceae and Portulacaeae (Caryophyllales). In Aizoaceae, WBTs are only found in genera of Ruschioideae; in Cactaceae, WBTs are found in xylem of leaves and stems in genera of Opuntioideae and Cactaceae. However, in the genus Anacampseros (Portulacaceae), WBTs are found in leaf xylem, but not as part of the xylem of the stems and instead, WBTs are found in <b>piths</b> and <b>rays.</b> It was hypothesized that the wide secondary wall prevents primary wall contact during extreme water stress and thus WBTs were thought to differentiate in response to water-stress. In order to determine what factors cause WBT initiation and differentiation, seedlings of Anacamperos rufescens (Portulacaceae) were exposed to varying light intensities that mimicked spring and summer light levels found in southern Africa. In this experiment, results show that WBTs are generally formed in advance of probable water-stress event times. Furthermore, the number of WBTs are directly correlated to the intensity of light received as a seedling; however, the mean WBT size remained relatively unchanged, presumably due to a rigid genetic control. Results suggest that, in Anacampseros rufescens, the later a seedling germinates, the greater the number of WBTs differentiate, which pre-adapts the plant for future water-stress events...|$|R
40|$|The use of inertinite {{macerals}} as palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic indicators is {{reliant on}} understanding their origin. Criteria {{to distinguish between}} carbonisation and pyrolysis, or saprotrophy resulting from fungal degradation, are not always clear. Without the presence of primary particles in coal, such as fungal sclerota, hyphae, char, and fly ash, the origin of inertinites is difficult to distinguish. This short study provides an insight into basic anatomical characteristics, which differentiate saprotrophied and carbonised inertinite group macerals. Modern plant matter and Permian phyterals are compared petrographically to observe changes in the macerals at a cellular level. Saprotrophic effects include thickening of the cell wall and cellular damage, delignification of the cell wall and cross <b>ray</b> <b>piths,</b> and the irregular oxidation radiating from xylem tissues. These characteristics are not observed in carbonised inertinites that show enlarged ray cells and the shrinking and homogenisation of cell walls. The simple differentiation between these characteristics in inertinites can greatly affect the palaeoenvironmental interpretations linked {{to the presence of}} inertinites in coal...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{relative}} freezing {{resistance of}} tissues in the stem, foliage and buds of terminal twigs from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) was investigated at about ten-day intervals from summer {{until the following}} spring. Tissues from growing twigs collected before development of dormancy had no freezing resistance and were killed immediately after subcooling. Tissues {{at the base of}} inner bud scales and in the pith of stems at the base of buds were among the last to harden in autumn. Pith parenchyma and <b>pith</b> <b>rays</b> of the interfascicular region of the bud trace and the transfusion tissue in needles were most susceptible to injury after development of freezing resistance. Abaxial mesophyll was more susceptible to injury than adaxial mesophyll of hardened needles. The cortex was more resistant than other tissues during development of freezing resistance but parenchyma of the pith lost freezing resistance more slowly and was more resistant after growth processes resumed in the spring. The phloem-cambium region of the stem lost freezing resistance earlier and became more susceptible to injury than other tissues of the twig after midwinter 0 Survival of the vegetative apex depended on the ability of its water to subcool. Heat of fusion of water on freezing produced a sharp exotherm that was a precise index of the temperature at death and freezing resistance of the vegetative apex. Prolonged subfreezing temperatures after development of freezing resistance in late autumn increased hardiness of twigs beyond that induced by the natural environment 6 Both formation of ice in the pith of stems enclosed by coriaceous bud scales, and artificial dehydration reduced water content and promoted subcooling and freezing resistance of vegetative apices. Moisture content was reduced from 200 to 70 percent on a dry weight basis after three days at _ 90 C in early February and freezing resistance of apices increased 0 0 0 from - 16 C to - 20 C when cooled at 1 C per minute 0 These findings suggested that diffusion of water from the protoplasm to sites of extracellular ice, and not low temperature, was the direct cause of hardening at subfreezing temperatures 0 The basic freezing curve for Douglas-fir is characteristic of plant tissues in general but was modified by exotherms associated with freezing and death of vegetative apices from November until April. A decline n length of the plateau after the second subcooling temperature during hardening, and increase in length of the plateau during loss of hardiness reflected probable seasonal change in quantity of intracellular water. Unhardened tissues survived freezing of extracellular water but were injured before intracellular water was completely frozen. Hardened tissues, on the other hand, were not injured until after most of the intracellular water was frozen and the cooling rate of the stem returned to normal. Observations suggested a definite relationship between time of acquisition and loss of freezing resistance and number of days to bud burst after March 31. Trees which developed freezing resistance earliest in fall broke buds earliest in spring. Trees which broke buds latest in spring were also those which were the last to deharden, Ready availability of potassium appears to enhance early development and loss of freezing resistance. Trees with the highest content of potassium in the current season's foliage burst buds earliest and those with the lowest content of potassium were the last to burst buds. Night temperatures of 20 C delayed but did not prevent loss of hardiness when day temperatures were 250 C in March. However, continuous temperature of 2 ° C failed to reharden twigs that had lost freezing resistance at 25 ° C. Injury to all tissues, except the vegetative apex, declined at 250 C in March when moisture stress exceeded a critical level. These observations suggest that environ mental conditions unfavorable for growth enable Douglas-fir to maintain resistance to injury from spring frosts...|$|R
60|$|Early frost {{had touched}} the heights with its magic wand. And the forest seemed a temple in which man might worship nature and life rather than steal through the dells {{and under the}} arched aisles like a beast of prey. The green-and-gold leaves of aspens quivered in the glades; maples in the ravines fluttered their red-and-purple leaves. The needle-matted carpet under the pines vied with the long lanes of silvery grass, alike {{enticing}} to the eye of man and beast. Sunny <b>rays</b> of light, <b>flecked</b> with dust and flying insects, slanted down from the overhanging brown-limbed, green-massed foliage. Roar of wind in the distant forest alternated with soft breeze close at hand. Small dove-gray squirrels ran all over the woodland, very curious about Jean and his dog, rustling the twigs, scratching the bark of trees, chattering and barking, frisky, saucy, and bright-eyed. A plaintive twitter of wild canaries came from the region above the treetops--first voices of birds in their pilgrimage toward the south. Pine cones dropped with soft thuds. The blue jays followed these intruders in the forest, screeching their displeasure. Like rain pattered the dropping seeds from the spruces. A woody, earthy, leafy fragrance, damp with the current of life, mingled with a cool, dry, sweet smell of withered grass and rotting pines.|$|R
40|$|The {{winter of}} 1884 and 5 and the {{remarkable}} drouth of 1887, destroyed {{all of the}} apple orchards in Iowa, except in a few localities, where natural drainage and a very porous condition of soils, favored constant growth during the summer seasons. All of our American apples, {{as well as all}} of the apples from western Europe, have proved much too tender on ordinary prairie soils. But the Duchess of Oldenburg, Tetofsky and a few other varieties of the apple from Russia, have endured the most trying tests {{in all parts of the}} state without being harmed. As Iowa farmers are anxious to plant new orchards again, as soon as they shall be assured that their late losses will not be repeated, I will give the results of my observations and experiments in Northern Iowa since 1866; which may be of much value to many who have given but little attention to the nature and wants of different kinds of trees. If apples had not been disseminated over many degrees of latitude and longitude in Europe, Asia and America; it is probable that there would have been but few varieties, now. But they were scattered widely over the face of the earth, and as they were taken farther and farther north, they acquired new characteristics which enabled them to endure more degrees of cold. And when they were moved to places where the climate was much dryer and hotter, or moister than the one to which they were adapted, changes were effected in them after several generations, which adapted them to the unfavorable conditions which surrounded them. That I may be clearly understood, while describing the effects of unfavorable climatic conditions upon trees, I will explain the structure of trees and the principles of plant growth very briefly. All of the differents parts of trees and herbaceous plants are composed of cells. A living cell is a very small, porous and elastic sack like a bladder; which contains a semi-fluid substance called protoplasm and assimilated cell sap. After growing for a short time, each cell is divided into two parts or two new cells, each of which again divides and thus growth proceeds, forming webs of cells, which are spread one upon another during the growing season. As the webs of cells become covered w 7 ith webs of newer cells, their walls grow thicker; they lose their protoplasm, their ends become perforated and unite, and they are converted into tubes. Of indefinite numbers of such tubes bundles are formed, causing ducts or air passages between them. Through such ducts in the sap wood of trees, the crude sap is taken from the roots to the leaves. The <b>pith</b> and medulary <b>rays</b> are used as store rooms for reserve food materials, from which new leaves will be formed during the following spring; or they may be used to support growth when the regular supplies of assimilated sap are cut off by drouth or other causes. The wood cells of a tree which have been formed in a single season, constitute the sap-wood. The protoplasm not only constructs sap-wood during the growing season, but it forms a new inner bark, by a process similar to that which was used in the formation of sap-wood. At the same time, the old inner bark is converted into new green bark and the old green bark is changed into corky bark. The lives of cells are of very short duration. In fact, the only living cells in the limbs, body or roots of a tree, are those which contain protoplasm. Except at the tender terminal points of growth, they are formed only on the outside of the sap wood and on the inside of the inner bark, and constitute what is called the cambium layer. Therefore, all the cells of a former season’s growth are dead and worthless, for all purposes, except conducting-fluids, and supporting more elevated parts of the tree. Then it is not difficult to understand, that the seat of life is in the very thin cambium layer, between the sapwood and bark of trees; that life is really in the semi-fluid protoplasm of the billions of working cells in this layer, and that all growth takes place here. When the atmosphere becomes sufficiently warm in the spring, the protoplasm becomes active at all points between the sap wood and the inner bark of trees, and new leaves are formed from reserve food materials, which were stored up in the medulary <b>rays</b> and <b>pith,</b> near the close of the previous seasons’ growth. As soon as the leaves become sufficiently developed, a green substance called chlorophyll is formed in them by rays of light, which is always combined with particles of protoplasm...|$|R
40|$|The {{breeding}} of hardy apples is naturally {{such a long}} time proposition {{that it would be a}} distinct advantage if by microscopic examination of the wood, by mechanical tests, or by other observations the hardiness of a tree could be determined while it was still in the nursery, The following is a summary of the facts brought out in the investigation of 2 ̆ 2 Hardiness in the Apple as Correlated with Structure and Composition. 2 ̆ 2 1. The cutting, compression and penetration tests seemed to indicate some correlation between hardiness and hardness, but exceptions were found. 2, Twigs from northern sections, except the forms of Metlus rivularis, Red June and Patten, were no harder than twigs from Iowa and further south. 3, Specific gravity tests of dry wood showing density corresponded very closely with the mechanical tests showing hardness, indicating that the two tests are fairly accurate means to the same end. 4. Variat ions in the specific gravity of twigs of the same variety from different sources were noted, as was also the case in the mechanical tests. Twigs of the same variety from the same source gave pretty uniform results. 5. The specific gravity of twigs varies, to some extent depending upon what part of the twig is used. The tenderer varieties, which mature a little later in the summer, gave the greatest specific gravity a short distance back of the tip; earlier maturing varieties increased in specific gravity in proportion to the distance from the tip. As the tests were made in July this difference is in all probability due to the difference in the maturing of the twigs used. 6. The maturity of the wood at the time cold weather sets in undoubtedly has a most important bearing upon the ability of the tree to withstand cold. 7. By noting the formation of terminal buds and the time of leaf fall a pretty accurate idea of maturity can be secured, except in case of a few varieties. 8. The hardier varieties on the average had a slightly lower moisture content than the more tender varieties. 9. The difference in water content can be explained partly at least by the fact that the more tender sorts evaporate water more readily than do the hardy varieties. Freezing tends to dry the twig out, and after a period of very cold weather the twigs of the hardy varieties are generally found to contain the most moisture. 10. The rate of evaporation is due in part to small differences in thickness and structure of bark, including differences in the number of cutinized layers. 11. Most of the hardy varieties contained a large amount of starch stored in the <b>pith</b> and medullary <b>rays.</b> The Malus ioensis, however, proved to be an exception in this regard. 12. Large, thick petals are correlated with hardiness, although the converse of this is not always true. 13. The results of the freezing experiments show that within the limits observed a sudden drop in temperature is more injurious than the actual degree of cold. 14. While all twigs not previously dried were injured to some extent when held in a temperature of - 10 degrees F. for 20 minutes, the injury was less in the hardier varieties, thus showing their ability better to withstand such a sudden drop in temperature. 15. While in the various lines of comparison which were made there were found many indications of morphological differences between hardy and tender varieties, yet from the practical view point as yet it is impossible to name anyone test by which the degree of constitutional hardiness of a seedling apple may be foretold. Among the various tests for hardiness, that of the length of season required by the tree to mature the season 2 ̆ 7 s growth is of first importance. Perhaps by taking careful notes on a number of trees of any particular variety for two or three years or more, noting their time of starting and cessation of growth, their ability to produce a good root system from the cion, their water content, the resistance of their twigs to sudden zero temperatures, and their rate of evaporation, a pretty accurate idea of the ability of the tree to withstand,,cold might be obtained. If in addition the variety has hard wood, a good amount of stored starch and large petals these would be further indications of hardiness, although from this study it appears that these points are of less importance than those first named...|$|R
