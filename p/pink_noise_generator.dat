50|$|The Prodigy {{was capable}} of {{a full range of}} {{synthetic}} sounds, from a gentle whistle or flute in the upper ranges, to sub-level bass (a sub oscillator allowed for very deep lows). The voltage controlled amplifier (VCA) was controllable only via a 3-stage ADR envelope controller (ADR short for Attack Decay Release).

50|$|Equalizers can correct {{problems}} {{posed by}} a room's acoustics, as an auditorium will generally have an uneven frequency response especially due to standing waves and acoustic dampening. The frequency response {{of a room}} may be analyzed using a spectrum analyzer and a <b>pink</b> <b>noise</b> <b>generator</b> for instance. Then a graphic equalizer can be easily adjusted {{to compensate for the}} room's acoustics. Such compensation can also be applied to tweak the sound quality of a recording studio in addition to its use in live sound reinforcement systems and even home hi-fi systems.|$|E
50|$|The Synthacon {{includes}} three voltage-controlled oscillators, a two-pole resonant Sallen Key filter, two ADSR envelope generators, a <b>pink</b> and white <b>noise</b> <b>generator,</b> and a 49-key keyboard. While the Synthacon {{was not a}} modular system, signal routing could be achieved {{through a series of}} switches. Although Steiner-Parker only sold a few hundred units, the filter of the Synthacon is still in use in modern modular synthesizers and a modern analog mono synthesizer, the Arturia MiniBrute.|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{indications}} that brain is organized {{not on a}} basis of individual unreliable neurons, but on a micro-circuital scale providing Lego blocks employed to create complex architectures. At such an intermediate scale, the firing activity in the microcircuits is governed by collective effects emerging by the background noise soliciting spontaneous firing, the degree of mutual connections between the neurons, and the topology of the connections. We compare spontaneous firing activity of small populations of neurons adhering to an engineered scaffold with simulations of biologically plausible CMOS artificial neuron populations whose spontaneous activity is ignited by tailored background noise. We provide {{a full set of}} flexible and low-power consuming silicon blocks including neurons, excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and both white and <b>pink</b> <b>noise</b> <b>generators</b> for spontaneous firing activation. We achieve a comparable degree of correlation of the firing activity of the biological neurons by controlling the kind and the number of connection among the silicon neurons. The correlation between groups of neurons, organized as a ring of four distinct populations connected by the equivalent of interneurons, is triggered more effectively by adding multiple synapses to the connections than increasing the number of independent point-to-point connections. The comparison between the biological and the artificial systems suggests that a considerable number of synapses is active also in biological populations adhering to engineered scaffolds...|$|R

The low-intensity <b>noise</b> <b>generators</b> of {{millimeter}} {{wavelength range}} find wide application in the engineering, biological appliance and therapy procedures {{due to the}} simplicity, reliability and efficiency at treatment of pain syndromes in the different branches of practical medicine. Design of the low-intensity <b>noise</b> <b>generator.</b> The features of low-intensity <b>noise</b> <b>generator</b> are electromagnetic waves generation {{by means of the}} radiation source (working substance) that has a temperature more or less of the environment ambient temperature. Structurally the radiation source is made as a millimeter range waveguide matched load. It is enclosed and heat-insulated.
