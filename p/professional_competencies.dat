40|$|<b>Professional</b> <b>competency</b> is a {{fundamental}} concept in nursing, which has a direct relationship with quality improvement of patient care and public health. Organizational commitment {{as a kind of}} affective attachment or sense of loyalty to the organization is an effective factor for <b>professional</b> <b>competency.</b> This study was conducted to evaluate the nurses´ <b>professional</b> <b>competency</b> and their organizational commitment as well as the relationship between these two concepts. This descriptive-analytic study was conducted at the hospitals affiliated with a University of Medical Sciences, in the southeast of Iran in 2016. The sample included 230 nurses who were selected using stratified random sampling. Data were gathered by three questionnaires including socio-demographic information, competency inventory for registered nurse (CIRN) and Allen Meyer's organizational commitment. Results showed that <b>professional</b> <b>competency</b> (Mean±SD: 2. 82 ± 0. 53, range: 1. 56 - 4. 00) and organizational commitment (Mean±SD: 72. 80 ± 4. 95, range: 58 - 81) of the nurses were at moderate levels. There was no statistically significant correlation between <b>professional</b> <b>competency</b> and organizational commitment (ρ = 0. 02; p = 0. 74). There were significant differences in <b>professional</b> <b>competency</b> based on marital status (p = 0. 03) and work experience (p< 0. 001).
