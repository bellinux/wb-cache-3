Instead he went to help set up the Endocrine Clinic at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, as a safe and highly effective method achieving pregnancy in anovulatory women and developed the Threshold Hypothesis of gonadothrophin action. In 1962 James Brown joined the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Melbourne. With colleagues, he developed methods for the safe use of human gonadotrophin with the minimum of multiple pregnancies, and for a time produced all the gonadotrophin for clinical use in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and parts of Canada. It was from these clinical results that he developed the incremental system of gonadotrophin therapy and propounded the threshold hypothesis of gonadotrophin action on the ovary. The threshold hypothesis explained, for the first time, how only one follicle is usually selected for ovulation in the human, but it took 20 years for the explanation to be universally accepted. The pregnancy rate achieved with gonadotrophin therapy has not been bettered. The key to this success was in mimicking the hormone patterns of the natural cycle as closely as possible, a point which is still not fully appreciated today. He continually improved the sensitivity, speed and convenience of the methods for measuring oestrogen and progesterone metabolites in urine, so that the lowest concentrations found in the human could be measured. In the early 1970s, {{the rest of the world}} changed to blood assays for monitoring ovarian and <b>pituitary</b> <b>activity.</b> The validation of these blood assays depended on demonstrating that the hormone patterns obtained were the same as those obtained by the urinary assays.|$|E

Hypophysectomy on day 1 with-out hormone replacement {{was followed by}} retarded development and subse-quent degeneration of zygotes. Viability ofblastocysts was maintained under these conditions by a single injection of a long-acting progestagen on day 1. Hypophysectomy at intervals beginning late on day 3 indicated that im-plantation is initiated by <b>pituitary</b> <b>activity</b> in the several hours around midnight of this day. In animals induced to ovulate and copulate by exo-genous gonadotrophin injections, the corresponding time of pituitary acti-vity was delayed by approximately 8 hr.

It is evident that the events ofearly pregnancy do not follow the normalphysiologicalpatternunder these conditions, and caution should be exercised in utilizing such animals. Of five neurodepressive agents examined, only trifluoperazine effectively delayed implantation. The effect of this substance injected at various times on day 3 ofpregnancy suggests that implantation in the mouse is initiated by neurally regulated <b>pituitary</b> <b>activity</b> between 16. 00 and 24. 00 hr. on this day.

This activity was increased 2 - to 4 -fold seven days postovariectomy, and stimulated activity was suppressed to intact levels by daily injections of 17 P-estradiol (E 2; 300 ng). In males, castration increased <b>pituitary</b> LUC <b>activity</b> 2 - to 4 -fold, and this was suppressed to intact levels by daily injections of 25 ag dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

These results indicate that feedback {{regulation of}} pituitary rLHILUC gene expression is operational in this transgenic mouse model.

40|$|A {{complete}} {{inventory of}} pituitary trophic responses depends on precise estimates of mitotic activity and apoptotic events, and accurate characterization and quantification of pituitary cell subtypes irrespective of previous and current physiological demand. For a discrete structure {{that has been}} so extensively studied, it is dis-appointing but perhaps not surprising {{that none of these}} measures is available and therefore that the relative con-tributions to changes in the proportions of pituitary cellular subpopulations of trophic activity, differentiation of pluripotent cells and variations in the secretory profiles of apparently committed cells remain almost impossible to determine. To fully appreciate the extent of this dilemma, it should be remembered that conservative estimates of the proportion of corticotrophs in the rat anterior pituitary under basal conditions vary over twofold and that it is still not clear whether the apparent threefold increase in mammotrophs during pregnancy is the result of matur-ation of uncommitted cells, transdifferentiation of other cells such as somatotrophs, cell division, or a mixture of all three. Equally, while it has been known for some time that adrenalectomy results in a transient increase in anterior <b>pituitary</b> mitotic <b>activity</b> and appropriately timed supra-physiological glucocorticoid replacement with a wave of apoptosis, the precise identity of the cells involved in both of these responses is open to question. Thus, although many of the physiological stimuli associated with apparent changes in the proportions of pituitary cellular subpopu-lations are known, the precise mechanism of the changes and the consequences of the same remain obscure.

Its activity ratio is an accurate indicator of cellular activity under various experimental conditions including: (1) age and sex, (2) hormone administration and (3) temperature and photoperiod. <b>Pituitary</b> <b>activity</b> in unstimulated birds is not altered by age, but thyroid activity is much higher in old birds than in young animals. Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) increases pituitary, thyroid and liver activity of prepubescent chickens, but {{has no effect on}} aged males and increases only thyroid and liver activities in aged females, suggesting a reduction in pituitary-thyroid function with advancing age. In prepubertal females, TRH increases pituitary and thyroid cAMP-PK activity, plasma T₃ and T₄ levels and liver T₄ monodeiodination. Thyroid activity reaches maximum activity before the pituitary, while plasma T₄ and liver T₄ monodeodinating activity reach their highest levels 20 minutes before plasma T₃. These findings suggest that fluctuations in liver T₄ 5 ' monodeiodinating activity might be responsible for the cyclic response of plasma T₃ and T₄. Castrated cockerels have larger pituitaries than untreated birds, but contain the same amount of DNA. Methimazole-fed cockerels have pituitaries significantly smaller than controls, while castrated cockerels fed methimazole have pituitaries the same size as untreated birds. Pituitary DNA is less than controls in both groups of methimazole-fed birds. These results are considered to be due to a change in the thyrotroph population, without an increase in total cell numbers, and may indicate a transformation of basophils. Pituitary cAMP-PK activity during cold stress substantiates this conclusion. Thyroid glands of castrated and untreated cockerels are smaller in size, histological appearance and DNA content; however, cAMP-PK activity is much greater in the castrated birds. Methimazole-fed cockerels have enlarged thyroid glands, elevated cAMP-PK activity, increased DNA and cellular hypertrophy; however, these effects may be mitigated by castration. Seven days after removal of testosterone supplements, photostimulated castrates have a higher thyroid cAMP-PK activity ratio than short day castrates; however, both groups are elevated above control, suggesting that long photoperiods enhance the stimulatory effects of castration on thyroid activity. <b>Pituitary</b> <b>activity</b> is elevated in long and short day birds seven days after removal of testosterone, but remains high only in short day castrates.

40|$|An unexplained {{hallmark}} of prolonged critical illness {{is the fact}} that food does not prevent or reverse protein wasting, while fat is paradoxically accrued. This `wasting syndrome ' often persists after the underlying disease has been resolved and thus perpetuates intensive care dependency. Although the crucial role of an intact hypothalamus±pituitary axis for homeostasis during stress is well recognized, the differences between the neuroendocrine changes observed in acute and prolonged critical illness were only recently described. Novel insights in this area are reviewed here. The initial endocrine stress response consists primarily of a peripheral inactivation of anabolic pathways while <b>pituitary</b> <b>activity</b> is essentially ampli®ed or maintained.

A sharp peak occurred in LH after 7 - 9 weeks, but concentrations returned to basal levels and below after 25 weeks of immunization. T levels remained elevated in the presence of falling LH concentrations. Changes in DHT paralleled those of T. Events following immunization with T showed a biphasic response. During the first 5 months, increased testicular T production was accompanied by periods of increased LI-I secretion.

This persistent mitotic effect contrasts with corticosterone and testosterone, changes in the levels of which induce only transient, self-limiting fluctuations in <b>pituitary</b> mitotic <b>activity.</b> To further define the putative long-term trophic effects of oestrogen, we have accurately analysed the effects of 7 and 28 days oestrogen treatment on anterior <b>pituitary</b> mitotic <b>activity</b> in ovariectomized 10 -week-old Wistar rats using both bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and timed colchicine-induced mitotic arrest.

Despite continued exposure to high-dose oestrogen and persistence of the increase in pituitary wet weight, the increase in mitotic index was unexpectedly not sustained. After 28 days of high-dose oestrogen treatment, anterior pituitary mitotic index and BrdU-labelling index were not significantly different from baseline. Although {{a powerful}} pituitary mitogen in the short term, responsible, presumably, for increased trophic variability in oestrus cycling females, these data indicate that in keeping with other trophic stimuli to the pituitary and in contrast to a much established dogma, the mitotic response to longer-term high-dose oestrogen exposure is transient and is not the driver of persistent pituitary growth, at least in female Wistar rats...|$|R

Hypo-physectomized, immature, female rats were utilized as the assay animals. A significant depression in plasma gonadotropic activity to all estrogen treatments was clearly demonstrated as evaluated by the ovarian and uterine weight responses in the assay animals.

A partial recovery of pituitary function after treatment with chemotherapy has previously been described but complete recovery with cessation of all hormone supplements is excessively rare. We report a patient presenting with anterior hypopituitarism with subsequent complete and sustained recovery of pituitary function after successful treatment of the lymphoma.

40|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{plays an important}} role in basic survival mechanisms by releasing fluctuating amounts of hormones into the bloodstream, depending on the circumstances the individual finds itself. However, despite these changes in pituitary hormonal production, neuroimaging studies have never been able to demonstrate changes in the activation level of the pituitary. The most apparent reason is the much higher blood flow rate in the pituitary than in the brain. However, the present PET-scanning study demonstrates for the first time that neuroimaging techniques can identify increased <b>pituitary</b> <b>activity.</b> In a study with 11 healthy women sexual orgasm compared to rest caused an increased blood supply to the pituitary. We assume that this increase signifies elevated pituitary activation in order to produce higher plasma concentrations of oxytocin and prolactin. These hormones induce vaginal and uterus movements, ovulation and enhancement of sperm and egg transport. No increased blood supply was observed comparing clitoral stimulation, orgasm attempt, and faked orgasm with rest. In a study with 11 healthy men comparing ejaculation with rest did not reveal increased pituitary activation, probably because ejaculation causes a much lower increase of oxytocin and prolactin plasma concentration than female orgasm.

We studied TH metabolism both centrally (in the pituitary) and peripherally (in the liver) in IL- 12 knock-out (IL- 12 (-/-)) and wild type (WT) mice during illness induced by administration of bacterial endotoxin (LPS). LPS induced a similar decrease in serum T- 3, T- 4 and liver 5 '-DI mRNA expression in IL- 12 (-/-) and WT mice with the exception of a smaller reduction of serum T 4 in IL- 12 (-/-) mice. In the pituitary, the LPS-induced decline in 5 '-DI activity in WT mice was not observed in IL- 12 (-/-) mice (p < 0. 001), whereas the decrease in DII activity tended to be smaller in IL- 12 (-/-) mice (p = 0. 066).

In the present study, anterior pituitary sonicates or hepatic and thyroid microsomes from ovariectomized (OVX) rats treated or not with estradiol benzoate (EB, 0. 7 or 14 µg/ 100 g body weight, sc, for 10 days) were assayed for type I 5 '-ID (5 '-ID-I) and type II 5 '-ID (5 '-ID-II, only in <b>pituitary)</b> <b>activities.</b> The 5 '-ID activity was evaluated by the release of 125 I from deiodinated 125 I rT 3, using specific assay conditions for type I or type II. Serum TSH and free T 3 and free T 4 were measured by radioimmunoassay. OVX alone induced a reduction in pituitary 5 '-ID-I (control = 723. 7 ± 67. 9 vs OVX = 413. 9 ± 26. 9; P< 0. 05), while the EB-treated OVX group showed activity {{similar to that of}} the normal group. Thyroid 5 '-ID-I showed the same pattern of changes, but these changes were not statistically significant. Pituitary and hepatic 5 '-ID-II did not show major alterations. The treatment with the higher EB dose (14 µg), contrary to the results obtained with the lower dose, had no effect on the reduced pituitary 5 '-ID-I of OVX rats. However, it induced an important increment of 5 '-ID-I in the thyroid gland (0. 8 times higher than that of the normal group: control = 131. 9 ± 23. 7 vs ovx + EB 14 µg = 248. 0 ± 31. 2; P< 0. 05), which is associated with increased serum TSH (0. 6 -fold vs OVX, P< 0. 05) but normal serum free T 3 and free T 4. The data suggest that estrogen is a physiological stimulator of anterior pituitary 5 '-ID-I and a potent stimulator of the thyroid enzyme when employed at high dose...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{reported}} associations between measures of size and weight at birth and disease risk in later life. Alteration in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to prenatal stress has been proposed as one underlying mechanism. The present study investigated in humans the association of prenatal psychosocial stress exposure with subsequent HPA axis regulation in adult life, {{with a focus on}} measures of response to challenge and feedback sensitivity. Healthy young adults whose mothers experienced severe stress during their pregnancy in form of major negative life events (e. g. death of someone close; prenatal stress (PS) group, n= 31) and an age-matched comparison group (CG, n= 30) underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a 1 microg ACTH(1 - 24) stimulation test. In addition, a diurnal cortisol profile was assessed. ACTH concentrations following a standardized behavioural challenge paradigm (TSST) were marginally significantly higher in PS subjects than in CG subjects (p=. 06). Pre-TSST adrenocortical (cortisol) levels were lower (p=. 007), whereas the increase in cortisol in response to the TSST was higher (p=. 03) in PS subjects compared to CG subjects. Cortisol concentrations following a pharmacological stimulation test simulating <b>pituitary</b> <b>activity</b> (ACTH(1 - 24) test) were significantly lower in PS than in CG subjects (p=. 006). No differences emerged between the two groups in basal diurnal cortisol levels. This study provides first evidence in humans of an association between prenatal psychosocial stress exposure and subsequent alterations in the regulation of the HPA axis...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} analyze {{the time course of}} demasculinization in the Japanese quail and to test the activating and organizing effects of estradiol (E 2) in adult sexually active birds. In Experiment 1, males and females were castrated at the age of 1 day or 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks and treated as adults with testosterone (T). The age of castration had no effect on behavior and morphology in males. Plasma gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) were, however, higher in males castrated at or before than in those castrated after 2 weeks of age. This suggests that postnatal testicular secretions have organizing effects on the <b>pituitary</b> <b>activity.</b> Females which were castrated before 1 week of age were less sensitive to the activating effects of T than males, but were not fully demasculinized. The demasculinization of different reproductive characteristics such as male sexual behavior, cloacal gland size, and weight of the syringeal muscles is achieved in females at different times posthatching. In Experiment 2, castration of male and female quail at the ages of 4 days or 4 weeks confirmed that postnatal ovarian secretions contribute to the full behavioral and morphological demasculinization of females. It is easier to elicit mounting in T-treated females when they are tested in their home cage instead of a test arena. This difference was not observed in males. During Experiment 3, it was impossible to demasculinize sexually active adult males or females by treatment with Silastic implants of E 2. E 2 did not maintain sexual behavior in ovariectomized females showing male sexual behavior when treated with T but maintained the behavior in males. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background When European silver eels (Anguilla anguilla) {{venture into}} the Atlantic Ocean for their 6, 000 km semelparous {{spawning}} run to the Sargasso Sea, they are still in a prepubertal stage. Further sexual development appears to be blocked by dopaminergic inhibition of hypothalamus and <b>pituitary</b> <b>activity.</b> Recently, we found that swimming for several weeks in freshwater stimulated the incorporation of fat droplets in the oocytes. So, {{it was hypothesized that}} long term swimming in seawater would release the inhibition further and would also stimulate the production of vitellogenin by the liver. Methods For this study a swim-flume was constructed to allow simulated migration of migratory female silver eels for 3 months (1, 420 km) in natural seawater at 20 degrees C. Primers were designed for polymerase chain reactions to measure the mRNA expression of estrogen receptor 1 (esr 1), vitellogenin 1 (vtg 1) and vitellogenin 2 (vtg 2) genes in the liver of European female silver eels. Results In comparison to resting eels, swimming eels showed a diminished expression of esr 1, vtg 1 and vtg 2 in the liver. They also had lower plasma calcium (Ca; indicative of vitellogenin) levels in their blood. This showed that vitellogenesis is more strongly suppressed in swimming than in resting eels. However, when eels were subsequently stimulated by 3 weekly carp pituitary extract injections, the expression of the same genes and plasma levels of Ca strongly increased in both groups to similar levels, thus equalizing the initial differences between resting and swimming. Conclusions It is concluded that vitellogenesis remains suppressed during resting and even more during swimming. The fact that swimming stimulates fat deposition in the oocytes but suppresses vitellogenesis indicates that these events are separated in nature and occur sequentially. Swimming-suppressed vitellogenesis may imply that in nature eels undergo vitellogenesis and final maturation near or at the spawning grounds. </p...|$|E

Previous {{studies have shown that}} shelter living produces elevations in hypothalamic–pituitary–activity (HPA) activity and suggest that a dysregulation between <b>pituitary</b> and adrenal <b>activity</b> may occur as a dog’s stay is prolonged. To further examine these issues, we performed a ﬁne-grained analysis of pituitary–adrenal measures {{over the course of a}} dog’s ﬁrst 14 days in a county animal shelter.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effect of alterations in GnRH signal pattern (pulsatile vs. continuous; pulse frequency) on mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and whether MAPK {{plays a role in}} regulating gonadotrope gene expression. <b>Pituitary</b> MAPK <b>activity</b> was measured by immunoblot, using a phospho-specific MAPK antibody, corrected to the amount of total MAPK per sample. In vivo studies were conducted in adult castrate testosterone-replaced male rats (to suppress endogenous GnRH). Animals received pulsatile or continuous GnRH (or BSA-saline for controls) via jugular cannulas. Initial studies revealed that pulsatile GnRH stimulated a dose-dependent rise in MAPK activity (30 ng, 2 -fold increase; 100 ng, 4 -fold; 300 ng, 8 -fold) 4 min after the pulse. The effect of pulsatile vs. continuous GnRH was examined by administering 50 -ng pulses (60 -min interval) or a continuous infusion (25 ng/min) for 1, 2, 4, or 8 h...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{phenelzine}} {{and several of}} its derivatives in interrupting pregnancy, and on sexual development, were investigated in mice. At dose levels of one-fifth LD 50 given on days 1 =n-of pregnancy, phenel-zine had a low but significant activity and some derivatives were more active. There {{was no evidence that}} monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity was related to the anti-fertility activity of these compounds. The effects of two of the compounds investigated for this purpose(WL 27 and LON 41) were partially reversed by either progesterone or prolactin. WL 27 interrupted the normal oestrous cycle, delayed the onset of oestrus in immature female mice and depressed the weights of sex organs in immature and in non-pregnant adult mice, and in immature male mice. These effects suggest that these compounds produce a depression of <b>pituitary</b> gonadotrophic <b>activity.</b> However, the depression is not complete since WL 27 did not interrupt pseudopregnancy...|$|R
