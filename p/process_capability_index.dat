50|$|The process {{capability}} of systems, materials, and products {{needs to be}} compatible with the specified engineering tolerances.

40|$|<b>Process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>indexes</b> {{are widely}} used in the {{manufacturing}} industries and by supplier companies in process assessments and {{in the evaluation of}} purchasing decisions. One concern about using the <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>indexes</b> is the assumption of the mutual independence of the process data, because, in process industries, process data are often autocorrelated. This paper discusses the use of the <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>indexes</b> Cp and Cpk when the process data are autocorrelated. Interval estimation procedures for Cp and Cpk are proposed and their properties are studied. ...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the process}} {{capability}} {{is a function}} of the specification, the <b>Process</b> <b>Capability</b> <b>Index</b> is only as good as the specification. For instance, if the specification came from an engineering guideline without considering the function and criticality of the part, a discussion around process capability is useless, and would have more benefits if focused on what are the real risks of having a part borderline out of specification. The loss function of Taguchi better illustrates this concept.|$|E
5000|$|In process {{improvement}} efforts, the <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> or process capability ratio is a statistical measure of process capability: {{the ability of}} a process to produce output within specification limits. [...] The concept of process capability only holds meaning for processes that {{are in a state of}} statistical control. Process capability indices measure how much [...] "natural variation" [...] a process experiences relative to its specification limits and allows different processes to be compared with respect to how well an organization controls them.|$|E

This is often determined through statistical process control. Variations in the product are correlated to aspects of the process and eliminated.

40|$|In today&# 039;s {{competitive}} business environment, it {{is becoming}} more crucial than ever to assess precisely process losses due to non-compliance to customer specifications. To assess these losses, industry is widely using <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> for performance evaluation of their processes. Determination of the performance capability of a stable process using the standard <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> requires that the underlying process data should follow a normal distribution. However, if the data is non-normal, measuring <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> using conventional methods can lead to erroneous results. Different <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> such as Clements percentile method and data transformation method have been proposed {{to deal with the}} non-normal situation. Although these methods are practiced in industry, there is insufficient literature to assess the accuracy of these methods under mild and severe departures from normality.

A simulation study using Weibull, Gamma and lognormal distributions is conducted. Burr&# 039;s method calculates <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> for each set of simulated data.

50|$|The {{ability of}} a process to meet {{specifications}} can be expressed as a single number using a <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> {{or it can be}} assessed using control charts. Either case requires running the process to obtain enough measurable output so that engineering is confident that the process is stable and so that the process mean and variability can be reliably estimated. Statistical process control defines techniques to properly differentiate between stable processes, processes that are drifting (experiencing a long-term change in the mean of the output), and processes that are growing more variable. Process capability indices are only meaningful for processes that are stable (in a state of statistical control).|$|E

40|$|Classic process {{capability}} indices such as C a, C p and C pk are well-known {{process capability}} indices, which are using widely. Since, process capability indices predict {{the capability of}} a process, they must have a significant relation with rate of rejects and losses.

Therefore, the loss-based indices are more appropriate and suitable indices to predict the capability of a process. In order to define a new loss-based <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>index,</b> Taguchi loss functions were employed and this study proposed a novel <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> called Taguchi-based <b>Process</b> <b>Capability</b> <b>Index</b> (TPCI).

40|$|Abstract: Process {{capability}} indices such as Cp, Cpk, Cpu and Cpl {{are common}} metrics {{to evaluate and}} predict {{the performance of a}} process. Although higher process capability indices indicate higher process “quality”, but a high quality process does not necessarily guarantee the fewer rates of rejects. Therefore, a <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> based on rate of rejects or real losses is more reliable and proper. This paper defines a novel <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> called asymmetric inverted normal loss-based <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> (AIPCI) with the aid of asymmetric inverted normal loss function. The logical idea is to compare the standard loss for a capable process with other cases. AIPCI is a bounded asymmetric <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> and can provide a more realistic metric to evaluate and predict the performance of a process.

40|$|AbstractStatistical {{quality control}} (SQC) {{is used by}} {{companies}} and industries for many reasons. For example, the process capability of machines is {{an important aspect of}} SQC, which consists in evaluating the ability of a production process to perform with the required specifications. In other words, the process capability measures the ability of a process of producing acceptable products according to the established specifications. The most common indicator used to measure the process capability is the <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>index,</b> which depends on the process standard deviation. In practice, the standard deviation is unknown, and the <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>index</b> is thus estimated by using an estimator of the process standard deviation. In this paper, we describe the most common estimators of the process standard deviation, and define the corresponding estimators of the <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>index.</b> A bound for the bias ratio of the various estimators is obtained. Monte Carlo simulation studies are carried out to analyze the empirical performance of the various estimators of the <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>index.</b> Empirical results indicate that biases can be obtained, specially in the presence of small samples.

Methods: The proposed procedure consists of 5 steps. Step 1 is to prepare the alternative vectors. Step 2 is to rank the vectors based on <b>process</b> <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> in a pairwise manner. Step 3 is to transform the pairwise rankings into the inequalities between the corresponding WMSE values. Step 4 is to obtain the weight value by calculating the inequalities.

30|$|In this paper, {{a method}} was {{proposed}} {{to calculate the}} specific <b>capability</b> <b>indices</b> for the <b>process</b> in {{the second stage of}} a two-stage process.
