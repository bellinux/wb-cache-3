2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{use of the}} contiguous term Islamic Fascism {{dates to}} 1933 when Akhtar Ḥusayn Rā’ēpūrī, in an attack on Muḥammad Iqbāl, defined attempts to secure the independence of Pakistan {{as a form of}} Islamic fascism. Some analysts consider Manfred Halpern's use of the phrase 'neo-Islamic totalitarianism' in his 1963 book The Politics of Social Change in the Middle East and North Africa, as a precursor to the concept of Islamofascism, in that he discusses Islamism as a new kind of fascism. Halpern's <b>primary</b> <b>case</b> was based on an analysis of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, and he argued that such Islamic movements were an obstacle to the military regimes who were in his view representatives of a new middle class capable of modernizing the Middle East. Halpern's work, commissioned by the United States Air Force from the Rand Corporation, [...] arguably represents a mix of mid-Cold War analysis and orientalism.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Recently, Clostridium difficile has {{garnered}} {{both national}} and international attention, occurring with greater frequency, severity and resistance to standard treatments. In 2001, Clostridium difficile-associated disease, CDAD, became epidemic and its rate doubled from 2000 to 2003. As a substantial cause of healthcare-associated morbidity, CDAD {{is no longer just}} a pharmacotherapy nuisance. Specifically, the objectives of this research are to determine the incidence of both <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>cases</b> of CDAD among patients in the UHC database, determine how many <b>primary</b> <b>cases</b> had previous admissions with secondary cases of CDAD, and determine how many <b>primary</b> <b>cases</b> go on to be readmitted as <b>primary</b> or secondary <b>cases.</b> Methods: This cross-sectional study used the dataset from the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) covering the first quarter of 2002 through the second quarter of 2006, to identify the incidence of primary and secondary CDAD within hospitals participating in the UHC 2 ̆ 7 s Clinical Resource Manager (CRM) program. The UHC-CRM database was used to provide epidemiologic data in regards to CDAD cases, hospital-wide variables and patient characteristics. The data was analyzed using SAS statistical software.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of measles among a predominantly unvaccinated and susceptible Amish popula-tion in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, offered {{the opportunity to}} test the hypothesis that sec-ondary cases in households are more severe than <b>primary</b> <b>cases</b> because the former have more intense exposure and receive a greater virus inoculum. Of 130 measles cases reported between April and June 1988, 119 (92 %) constituted a study of disease severity. Severity was assessed by determining frequency and duration of symptoms, length of any hospitalization, and number of days in bed. In a univariate analysis, fewer secondary cases had conjunctivitis (relative risk [RR], 0. 67; 95 % confidence interval [CIl, 0. 48 - 096) and headache (RR, 0. 37; CI, 0. 15 - 0. 86), but more had earache (RR, 9. 69; CI, 1. 8 - 202. 9) compared with <b>primary</b> <b>cases.</b> Secondary cases had a shorter mean duration of coryza (4. 0 vs. 5. 0 days, Student's t test, P =. 08).
