40|$|AbstractThe Malaysian {{research}} {{progress is}} reflected through <b>publications,</b> <b>funding,</b> intellectual property and knowledge transfer. However, literatures on translating {{the outcome of}} social science and humanities research into practice are lacking. This paper studies the issues of translating knowledge derived from the social science and humanities research into beneficial products for the society. Data is gathered from primary and secondary sources. The findings show slower output and mediocre amount of <b>publications,</b> reasonable <b>funding</b> for research, no quantified knowledge translation between universities and industry, and the research culture at formative years. Conclusively, more determination is needed to translate research into practice for social science and humanities research in Malaysia...|$|R
