25|$|Although {{complex and}} controversial, the main {{factor in the}} eastern gray squirrel's {{displacement}} of the red squirrel {{is thought to be}} its greater fitness, hence a competitive advantage over the red squirrel on all measures. The eastern gray squirrel tends to be larger and stronger than the red squirrel and has been shown to have a greater ability to store fat for winter. The squirrel can, therefore, compete more effectively for a larger share of the available food, resulting in relatively lower survival and breeding rates among the red squirrel. <b>Parapoxvirus</b> may also be a strongly contributing factor; red squirrels have long been fatally affected by the disease, while the eastern gray squirrels are unaffected, but thought to be carriers – although how the virus is transmitted has yet to be determined. However, several cases of red squirrels surviving have been reported, as they have developed an immunity – although their population is still being massively affected. The red squirrel is also less tolerant of habitat destruction and fragmentation, which has led to its population decline, while the more adaptable eastern gray squirrel has taken advantage and expanded.|$|E

The molecular mechanisms by which the C 7 L gene exerts host range function are not well understood. The C 7 L protein does not have any known conserved domains or show sequence similarity to cellular proteins or viral proteins other than the C 7 L homologs in mammalian poxviruses. We generated recombinant vaccinia viruses carrying deletion mutants of the C 7 L gene using NYVAC as a parental strain and found that the N-terminus is essential for host range function of C 7 L, which is consistent with a previous report that showed that homology among C 7 L homologs are greater near the N-terminus than the C-terminus...|$|R

In addition to disease in the animals, the virus can be quite a nuisance as an occupational hazard in farmers and butchers. Clinical diagnosis is often possible, but laboratory diagnosis is sometimes necessary. For virus isolation, primary ovine or bovine cells, not routinely present, are needed. Serological methods exist, but electron microscopy is the most commonly used method. OBJECTIVES: To develop a reliable method for the laboratory diagnosis of orf zoonoses, without virus culture and without access to an electron microscope. STUDY DESIGN: A suitable primer pair was designed for orf polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using the Oligo software and sequence information from GenBank. Orf positive controls and specimens were kindly provided by several public health centers. Molluscum contagiosum specimens were provided by a dermatologist. HSV- 1, HSV- 2 and VZV positive swab specimens came from our routine diagnostic service. Asymptomatic skin specimens were obtained from sheep heads from the abattoir, and swab specimens from the heads of asymptomatic sheep. Selected amplified orf PCR positive specimens were sequenced to ensure the authenticity of the PCR products. Orf positive specimens were sent to another laboratory for electron microscopy. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A robust PCR was developed, with very small inter-run variation. All specificity demands were met, and the sensitivity seems to be good or excellent. All negative specificity controls from cell cultures and non-orf viruses were negative. Twenty-two (95. 7 %) of 23 scab or swab specimens with suspected orf etiology were orf PCR positive. Five of eight skin specimens from sheep heads from the abattoir were positive, and all 11 swab specimens from asymptomatic sheep were negative. Electron microscopy demonstrated orf-like particles in orf-PCR positive specimens. This PCR seems to be suitable as a diagnostic test for orf in humans, but asymptomatic virus shedding in sheep or goats may complicate veterinary applications of the assay...|$|R

Adenoviral Hepatitis causes organ failure and death. Mycoplasmosis causes polyarthritis and pneumonia in crocodilians {{under the age of}} three. Infected animals have swollen jaws and are unable to move. Chlamydiosis has two forms that affects juveniles under one year of age. The first causes acute hepatitis, usually resulting in death.

Parasitic infections include tapeworm cysts, Trichinella spiralis nelsoni in the meat of Nile crocodiles in Zimbabwe, and Coccidia.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{symptoms}} of Orthopoxvirus infection include fever, malaise, head and body aches, and occasionally vomiting.

Severe edema and erythema may affect large areas of the body in cases of severe infection. Encephalitis (alteration of mental status and focal neurologic deficits), myelitis (upper- and lower-motor neuron dysfunction, sensory level and bowel and bladder dysfunction), or both may result from Orthopoxvirus infection.

50|$|A {{decline of}} the red {{squirrel}} {{and the rise of}} the Eastern gray squirrel, an introduced species from North America, has been widely remarked upon in British popular culture.

Evidence also shows that gray squirrels are vectors of the squirrel <b>parapoxvirus</b> for which no vaccine is currently available, and which is deadly to red squirrels but does not seem to affect the non-native host. Currently, the red squirrel's range has been reduced to the coniferous forests in Scotland, and in England's Formby, the Lake District, Brownsea Island, and the Isle of Wight. The majority of England's red squirrels are found in the county of Northumberland. Special measures are in place to contain and remove any infiltration of gray squirrels into these areas.

40|$|Abstract Background Two {{outbreaks}} {{of the disease}} contagious ecthyma were reported in 1999 and 2000 in Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). Contagious ecthyma is an epidermal disease of sheep and goats worldwide, which {{is caused by the}} zoonotic <b>parapoxvirus</b> orf virus. Characterisation of clinical samples from the two outbreaks in semi-domesticated reindeer in Norway by electron microscopy and PCR (B 2 L) revealed typical <b>parapoxvirus</b> particles and partial gene sequences corresponding to <b>parapoxvirus,</b> respectively. If contagious ecthyma in reindeer is caused by orf virus, the virus may be transferred from sheep and goats, via people, equipment and common use of pastures and corrals, to reindeer. Another possibility is that contagious ecthyma in reindeer is caused by a hitherto unclassified member of the <b>parapoxvirus</b> genus that circulates among reindeer herds and remains endemic in Norway. Results Genomic comparisons of one standard orf strain (orf NZ 2) and the reindeer isolates, employing restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, demonstrated high similarity between the reindeer viruses and known orf virus strains. Partial DNA sequences of two different viral genes were determined for the different isolates and compared with corresponding <b>parapoxvirus</b> genebank sequences. The comparison/alignment and construction of phylogenetic trees also point to an affiliation of the reindeer viruses to the species orf virus. Conclusion The results of this work imply that the <b>parapoxvirus</b> causing contagious ecthyma in Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer belongs to the species orf virus and that the orf virus crosses the host species barrier from sheep and goat to semi-domesticated reindeer. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the spring}} of 2006, four human cases of <b>parapoxvirus</b> infections in Missouri {{residents}} were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two of which were initially diagnosed as cutaneous anthrax. This investigation was conducted to determine the level of recognition of zoonotic <b>parapoxvirus</b> infections and prevention measures, {{the degree to which}} veterinarians may be consulted on human infections and what forces were behind this perceived increase in reported infections. Interviews were conducted and clinical and environmental sampling was performed. Swab and scab specimens were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), whereas serum specimens were evaluated for <b>parapoxvirus</b> antibodies. Three case patients were found to have fed ill juvenile animals without using gloves. Forty-six percent of veterinarians reported having been consulted regarding suspected human orf infections.
