50|$|The Dana 50 axle {{featured}} on most F-250 Super Dutys differs greatly {{from the early}} models. The Dana 50 {{started out as a}} Twin Traction Beam axle (much like independent suspension) in 1980. This lasted all the way to 1997 models. The Super Duty models then used a solid axle version of this axle. The ring, <b>pinion,</b> <b>carrier</b> and u joints all remained the same however. The Dana 50 was phased out of the trucks in 2004, in favor of the Dana 60 and was last used in the Ford Excursion.|$|E
50|$|Ford {{first used}} the 8.8 axle in 1983 model year trucks {{and is still}} in {{production}} for the Ford Ranger and Ford F-Series. It was also used in the Ford SUVs until Independent suspension replaced the solid axle. Ring, <b>pinion</b> and <b>carrier</b> all remained between the solid axle and independent rear suspension.|$|R
5000|$|... 1999 Ford revamped {{their heavy}} trucks, {{including}} their own Sterling axle. An upgraded 3 <b>pinion</b> differential <b>carrier</b> was added. The differentials are interchangeable {{between the two}} variations. The new axle also came with disc brakes and a unique 8x170mm metric lug pattern. Options and features remained unchanged until model year 2011 trucks. 2011 models with this axle {{have the option of}} being equipped with an electronic locking differential.|$|R
50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to locking hubs. CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an axle shaft (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and side gears to spin, while the differential <b>carrier,</b> <b>pinion</b> and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split axle shafts. The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|R
