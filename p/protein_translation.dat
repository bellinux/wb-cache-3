5|$|Specialized export {{proteins}} {{exist for}} translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' {{central role in}} <b>protein</b> <b>translation.</b> Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{synthesized}} mRNA molecules {{are known}} as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for <b>protein</b> <b>translation.</b> The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA {{is associated with a}} variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and {{is the first step in}} post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete.|$|E

5|$|Translation is {{the process}} by which a mature mRNA {{molecule}} is used as a template for synthesizing a new <b>protein.</b> <b>Translation</b> is carried out by ribosomes, large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds. The genetic code is read three nucleotides at a time, in units called codons, via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA has three unpaired bases known as the anticodon that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA. The tRNA is also covalently attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon. When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA strand, the ribosome attaches its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain, which is synthesized from amino terminus to carboxyl terminus. During and after synthesis, most new proteins must fold to their active three-dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions.|$|E
25|$|Doxycycline {{and other}} members of the {{tetracycline}} class of antibiotics are often used as research reagents in in vitro and in vivo biomedical research experiments involving bacteria as well in experiments in eukaryotic cells and organisms with inducible protein expression systems using tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation. The mechanism of action for the antibacterial effect of tetracyclines relies on disrupting <b>protein</b> <b>translation</b> in bacteria, thereby damaging the ability of microbes to grow and repair; however <b>protein</b> <b>translation</b> is also disrupted in eukaryotic mitochondria impairing metabolism and leading to effects that can confound experimental results.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{regulation}} of translation is less prevalent than control of transcription or mRNA stability but is occasionally used.

Genomic resources [expressed sequence tags (ESTs), genome sequence, genetic and physical maps, proteomic and microarray datasets] are growing, but there has up to now been no single access and analysis portal for this group. Here we present ButterflyBase ([URL] a unified resource for lepidopteran genomics. A total of 273 077 ESTs from more than 30 different species have been clustered to generate stable unigene sets, and robust <b>protein</b> <b>translations</b> derived from each unigene cluster.

In particular, it has been estimated that AS occurs in 95% of all human multi-exon genes. AS has undeniable potential to influence myriad biological processes. Advancing knowledge in this area has critical implications for the study of biology in general.|$|R
25|$|Transcriptomics is most {{commonly}} {{applied to the}} mRNA content of the cell. However, the same techniques are equally applicable to non-coding RNAs that are not translated into a protein, but instead, have direct functions (e.g. roles in <b>protein</b> <b>translation,</b> DNA replication, RNA splicing and Transcriptional regulation). Many of these ncRNAs affect disease states, including cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases.|$|E
25|$|RNA {{polymerase}} II (Pol II) {{is responsible}} for the transcription of all mRNAs, some snRNAs, siRNAs, and all miRNAs.

25|$|Two {{different}} kinds of genetic material exist: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Cells use DNA for their long-term information storage.

40|$|Cytosolic carboxypeptidases (CCPs) {{constitute}} a new subfamily of M 14 metallocarboxypeptidases associated to axonal regeneration and neuronal degeneration, among others. CCPs are deglutamylating enzymes, able to catalyze the shortening of polyglutamate side-chains and the gene-encoded C termini of tubulin, telokin, and myosin light chain kinase. The functions of these enzymes {{are not entirely}} understood, {{in part because of}} the lack of information about C-terminal protein processing in the cell and its functional implications. By means of C-terminal COFRADIC, a positional proteomics approach, we searched for cellular substrates targets of CCP 1, the most relevant member of this family.

Frequency of <b>protein</b> <b>translation</b> changes as animals age.

This form of mRNA is decreased in both the CA1 and CA2 hippocampal regions, these reduced levels causing spatial learning deficits.|$|E
25|$|Fragment A {{inhibits}} {{the synthesis}} of new proteins in the affected cell by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor EF-2—a protein that {{is essential to the}} translation step of protein synthesis. This ADP-ribosylation involves the transfer of an ADP-ribose from NAD+ to a diphthamide (a modified histidine) residue within the EF-2 protein. Since EF-2 is needed for the moving of tRNA from the A-site to the P-site of the ribosome during <b>protein</b> <b>translation,</b> ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 prevents protein synthesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{unfolded}} protein response (UPR) is {{a cellular}} stress response {{related to the}} endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR is activated {{in response to an}} accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR functions to restore normal function of the cell by halting <b>protein</b> <b>translation,</b> degrading misfolded proteins, and activating the signaling pathways that lead to increasing the production of molecular chaperones involved in protein folding. Sustained overactivation of the UPR has been implicated in prion diseases as well as several other neurodegenerative diseases and the inhibition of the UPR could become a treatment for those diseases.|$|E
40|$|The {{transcriptome}} {{provides the}} database {{from which a}} cell assembles its collection of <b>proteins.</b> <b>Translation</b> of individual mRNA species into their encoded proteins is regulated, producing discrepancies between mRNA and protein levels. Using a new modeling approach to data analysis, a striking diversity is revealed in association of the transcriptome with the translational machinery. Each mRNA has its own pattern of ribosome loading, a circumstance that provides an extraordinary dynamic range of regulation, above and beyond actual transcript levels. Using this approach together with quantitative proteomics, we explored the immediate changes in gene expression in response to activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in yeast by mating pheromone.

25|$|For {{partially}} complementary microRNAs to recognise their targets, nucleotides 2–7 of the miRNA (its 'seed region') must {{be perfectly}} complementary. Animal miRNAs inhibit <b>protein</b> <b>translation</b> {{of the target}} mRNA (this is present but less common in plants). Partially complementary microRNAs can also speed up deadenylation, causing mRNAs to be degraded sooner. While degradation of miRNA-targeted mRNA is well documented, whether or not translational repression is accomplished through mRNA degradation, translational inhibition, {{or a combination of}} the two is hotly debated. Recent work on miR-430 in zebrafish, as well as on bantam-miRNA and miR-9 in Drosophila cultured cells, shows that translational repression is caused by the disruption of translation initiation, independent of mRNA deadenylation.|$|E
25|$|The SRP RNA is an {{integral}} part of the small and the large domain of the SRP. The function of the small domain is to delay <b>protein</b> <b>translation</b> until the ribosome-bound SRP has an opportunity to associate with the membrane-resident SRP receptor (SR). Within the large domain, the SRP RNA of the signal peptide-charged SRP promotes the hydrolysis of two guanosine triphosphate (GTP) molecules. This reaction releases the SRP from the SRP receptor and the ribosome, allowing translation to continue and the protein to enter the translocon. The protein transverses the membrane co-translationally (during translation) and enters into another cellular compartment or the extracellular space. In eukaryotes, the target is the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In Archaea, SRP delivers proteins to the plasma membrane. In the bacteria, SRP primarily incorporates proteins into the inner membrane.|$|E
25|$|In other words, the {{considerable}} observable differences {{between humans and}} chimps may be due {{as much or more}} to genome level variation in the number, function and expression of genes rather than DNA sequence changes in shared genes. Indeed, even within humans, there {{has been found to be}} a previously unappreciated amount of copy number variation (CNV) which can make up as much as 5 – 15% of the human genome. In other words, between humans, there could be +/- 500,000,000 base pairs of DNA, some being active genes, others inactivated, or active at different levels. The full significance of this finding remains to be seen. On average, a typical human protein-coding gene differs from its chimpanzee ortholog by only two amino acid substitutions; nearly one third of human genes have exactly the same <b>protein</b> <b>translation</b> as their chimpanzee orthologs. A major difference between the two genomes is human chromosome 2, which is equivalent to a fusion product of chimpanzee chromosomes 12 and 13.

500|$|Gene {{expression}} of SFTPA2 is regulated {{at different levels}} including gene transcription, post-transcriptional processing, stability and translation (biology) of mature mRNA. One of the important features of human surfactant protein A mRNAs {{is that they have}} a variable five prime untranslated region (5’UTR) generated from splicing variation of exons A, B, C, and D. At least 10 forms of human SFTPA2 and SFTPA1 5’UTRs have been identified that differ in nucleotide sequence, length, and relative amount. Most SFTPA2 specific 5’UTRs include exon B.
