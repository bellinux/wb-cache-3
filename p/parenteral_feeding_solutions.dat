This report gives the results of the surveillance programme for central venous catheter-related sepsis (CRS), established by the PREZIES national network for the surveillance of nosocomial infections, for the period 2000 - 2003. Data, originating from 3 hospitals, were available on 751 lines in 554 patients, with 6443 catheter days and 19 cases of CRS. The mean CRS incidence was 2. 9 per 1000 catheter days and varied from 0 to 8. 0 per 1000 catheter days between hospitals. Univariate Cox regression showed the department where the catheter was inserted (ICU, OR/recovery or elsewhere) to {{have a significant effect on}} the risk of CRS; the particular use of the catheter also had a significant effect. Multivariate modelling for both these factors showed <b>parenteral</b> <b>feeding</b> (versus no <b>parenteral</b> <b>feeding)</b> to pose a relative risk of 11. 1 (95 % CI: 2. 4 - 52) and the placement department (OR/recovery compared to the ICU), a relative risk of 2. 9 (95 % CI: 0. 9 - 9. 8). The average CRS incidence is comparable with the 2 to 3 found in other studies. A higher risk with OR placement compared to ICU placement was not expected as sterile barriers are easier to realize at the OR. <b>Parenteral</b> <b>feeding</b> is a well-known risk factor for CRS.

Surgery had no additional significant influence on alanine turnover. In the post-absorptive state 4. 71 +/- 0. 71 mumol kg- 1 min- 1 was oxidized, during <b>parenteral</b> <b>feeding</b> before surgery 7. 93 +/- 1. 93 mumol kg- 1 min- 1 (P less than 0. 01 v. post-absorptive state), and during <b>parenteral</b> <b>feeding</b> after surgery 7. 67 +/- 1. 67 mumol kg- 1 min- 1.

40|$|Objective: {{to compare}} {{the time course of}} {{nutritional}} changes in relation to the components of nutritive support in the early postoperative period after extensive hepatectomies. Subjects and methods. Beginning with the 1 st postoperative day, 12 patients had <b>parenteral</b> <b>feeding</b> comprising 20 % glucose, fat emulsions, and specialized amino acid solutions (Group 1). Beginning with the same day, 14 patients were given the parenteral formula Oliclinomel (Group 2). Starting from the 2 nd postoperative day, both groups additionally received a balanced feeding formula by sipping. Results. Postoperatively, first-to-second degree encephalopathy was recorded in both groups. Positive changes as consciousness recovery were found in both Group 1 in which the patients used branched-chain amino acid-enriched solutions and Group 2 (<b>parenteral</b> Oliclinomel <b>feeding).</b> The patients under examination were not given albumin solutions and fresh frozen plasma in the postoperative period.

40|$|Objective: {{to define}} a role of various {{maintenance}} modes, such as enteral tube feeding (ETF) and complete <b>parenteral</b> <b>feeding</b> in different phases of acute pancreatitis (AP). Subjects and materials. The impact of various modes of nutritional support on pancreatic secretory activity and the course of AP was comparatively analyzed in 774 patients (mean age 45. 3 ± 4. 7 years) with AP. The criteria for evaluation of {{the activities of the}} pancreas and its inflammatory process activity were considered to be clinical and laboratory parameters (pain, body temperature, hemogram, amylasemia, the degree of dynamic ileus and abdominal inflammatory infiltrate, and the level of gastrointestinal peptides), and ultrasonographic and computed tomographic data. The additional impact of different types of protein-calorie provision on pancreatic secretory activity was studied in 23 patients with external pancreatic fistulas, by using debetometry. Results. ETF was shown to have a stimulating effect on pancreatic secretion and AP worsening when it was used in the early phases of the disease. The optimum time of complete <b>parenteral</b> <b>feeding</b> (days 5 — 14 after the onset of the disease) and the criteria for the possible initiation of ETF were determined. Emphasis was laid on the important role of enteral feeding in a package of therapeutic measures in AP in the phase of pyonecrotic lesions. Conclusion. The proposed nutritional support tactics along with mini-invasive surgical treatments could reduce postoperative and overall mortality rates to 4. 2 and 3. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim was {{to study}} the {{relationship}} between growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in critically ill patients. DESIGN: Case-control study of critically ill patients admitted to {{the intensive care unit}} was carried out. PATIENTS: Six critically ill patients (51 - 78 years) who required ventilation and parenteral nutrition and six age, weight, height, and sex-matched healthy adults were studied. MEASUREMENTS: The patients and controls were studied for two 24 -hour periods; the patients before and after starting <b>parenteral</b> <b>feeding,</b> and the controls during a 36 -hour fast and when taking meals equivalent in calories and protein to the patients' <b>parenteral</b> <b>feed.</b> Serum GH was measured at 20 -minute intervals and analysed by a pulse detection algorithm (Pulsar) and Fourier transformation. IGF-I was measured at 0, 12, and 24 hours. RESULTS: Patients had low serum IGF-I levels compared with controls, whether fasted or fed, despite having mean GH levels similar to fasted controls. For fasted patients vs fasted controls the mean (+/- 1 SD) GH levels were 4. 5 +/- 2. 0 vs 4. 0 +/- 2. 4 mU/l respectively, and IGF-I levels {{at the end of the}} fast were 0. 17 +/- 0. 11 vs 0. 78 +/- 0. 29 U/ml (P = 0. 003). Patients showed elevated baseline GH levels compared with controls when fasted and during <b>parenteral</b> <b>feeding</b> (patients vs controls fasted 3. 1 +/- 1. 9 vs 0. 8 +/- 0. 5 mU/l, P = 0. 01; patients vs controls fed 4. 2 +/- 4. 5 vs 0. 5 +/- 0. 04 mU/l, P = 0. 028). Fourier transformation confirmed oscillatory GH levels in the controls, fasted or fed, but this activity was attenuated in the patients. <b>Parenteral</b> <b>feeding</b> had no effect on the GH profiles or IGF-I levels of patients, but controls showed greater mean GH levels during their fast than when fed. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that critically ill patients have low IGF-I levels associated with augmented baseline GH levels which show reduced oscillatory activity. The results would be compatible with the hypothesis that there is an adaptive change in critically ill patients away from the indirect effects of GH (stimulation of IGF-I production and anabolism) and toward the direct effects (lipolysis and insulin antagonism) which increase the availability of energy substrates. The pattern of GH levels seen in our patients may be important in this adaptation...|$|R

Eudragit L 100 is a pH-responsive polymer whose dissolution threshold is pH 6 so dissolution testing of the prepared microparticles at pH 5 and 1. 2 illustrated non-polymer controlled burst release.
