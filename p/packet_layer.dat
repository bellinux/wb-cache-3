For identifying the channel to which a packet is associated, each packet contains a 12 bit logical channel identifier made up of an 8-bit logical channel number and a 4-bit logical channel group number. [...] Logical channel identifiers remain assigned to a virtual circuit {{for the duration of the}} connection. [...] Logical channel identifiers identify a specific logical channel between the DTE (subscriber appliance) and the DCE (network), and only has local significance on the link between the subscriber and the network. The other end of the connection at the remote DTE is likely to have assigned a different logical channel identifier. The range of possible logical channels is split into 4 groups: channels assigned to permanent virtual circuits, assigned to incoming virtual calls, two-way (incoming or outgoing) virtual calls, and outgoing virtual calls. [...] (Directions refer to the direction of virtual call initiation as viewed by the DTE they all carry data in both directions.) The ranges allowed a subscriber to be configured to handle significantly differing numbers of calls in each direction while reserving some channels for calls in one direction. All International networks are required to implement support for permanent virtual circuits, two-way logical channels and one-way logical channels outgoing; one-way logical channels incoming is an additional optional facility. [...] DTE-DCE interfaces are not required to support more than one logical channel. [...] Logical channel identifier zero will not be assigned to a permanent virtual circuit or virtual call.

40|$|In {{this article}} a {{framework}} is introduced {{that can be}} used to analyse the effects & requirements of P 2 P applications on application and on network layer. P 2 P applications are complex and deployed on a large scale, pure packet level simulations do not scale well enough to analyse P 2 P applications in a large network with thousands of peers. It is also difficult to assess the effect of application level behavior on the communication system. We therefore propose an approach starting with a more abstract and therefore scalable application level simulation. For the application layer a specific simulation framework was developed. The results of the application layer simulations plus some estimated background traffic are fed into a <b>packet</b> <b>layer</b> simulator like NS 2 (or our lab testbed) in a second step to perform some detailed <b>packet</b> <b>layer</b> analysis such as loss and delay measurements.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} channel coding theory applied to upper layers in the {{protocol}} stack of a communication link {{and it is}} the outcome of four year research activity. A specific aspect of this activity has been the continuous interaction between the natural curiosity related to the academic blue-sky research and the system oriented design deriving from the collaboration with European industry in the framework of European funded research projects. In this dissertation, the classical channel coding techniques, that are traditionally applied at physical layer, find their application at upper layers where the encoding units (symbols) are packets of bits and not just single bits, thus explaining why such upper layer coding techniques are usually referred to as <b>packet</b> <b>layer</b> coding. The rationale behind the adoption of <b>packet</b> <b>layer</b> techniques is in that physical layer channel coding is a suitable countermeasure to cope with small-scale fading, while it is less efficient against large-scale fading. This is mainly due to the limitation of the time diversity inherent in the necessity of adopting a physical layer interleaver of a reasonable size so as to avoid increasing the modem complexity and the latency of all services. <b>Packet</b> <b>layer</b> techniques, thanks to the longer codeword duration (each codeword is composed of several packets of bits), have an intrinsic longer protection against long fading events. Furthermore, being they are implemented at upper layer, <b>Packet</b> <b>layer</b> techniques have the indisputable advantages of simpler implementations (very close to software implementation) and of a selective applicability to different services, thus enabling a better matching with the service requirements (e. g. latency constraints). Packet coding technique improvement has been largely recognized in the recent communication standards as a viable and efficient coding solution: Digital Video Broadcasting standards, like DVB-H, DVB-SH, and DVB-RCS mobile, and 3 GPP standards (MBMS) employ packet coding techniques working at layers higher than the physical one. In this framework, the aim of the research work has been the study of the state-of-the-art coding techniques working at upper layer, the performance evaluation of these techniques in realistic propagation scenario, and the design of new coding schemes for upper layer applications. After a review of the most important <b>packet</b> <b>layer</b> codes, i. e. Reed Solomon, LDPC and Fountain codes, in the thesis focus our attention on the performance evaluation of ideal codes (i. e. Maximum Distance Separable codes) working at UL. In particular, we analyze the performance of UL-FEC techniques in Land Mobile Satellite channels. We derive an analytical framework which is a useful tool for system design allowing to foresee the performance of the upper layer decoder. We also analyze a system in which upper layer and physical layer codes work together, and we derive the optimal splitting of redundancy when a frequency non-selective slowly varying fading channel is taken into account. The whole analysis is supported and validated through computer simulation. In {{the last part of the}} dissertation, we propose LDPC Convolutional Codes (LDPCCC) as possible coding scheme for future UL-FEC application. Since one of the main drawbacks related to the adoption of <b>packet</b> <b>layer</b> codes is the large decoding latency, we introduce a latency-constrained decoder for LDPCCC (called windowed erasure decoder). We analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art LDPCCC when our decoder is adopted. Finally, we propose a design rule which allows to trade-off performance and latency...|$|E

Otherwise, the AP will assume packet loss and a packet retransmission would be initiated in the following transmission. With the user order list, the users that have successful packet receptions will send ACK packets one by one to notify the AP. The ACK packets include the user and sub-channel information, according to the order in the list. Since the ACK transmission time can be pre-calculated and followed by a DIFS slot, other users in the queue can virtually sense the total number of ACK frames.|$|R
