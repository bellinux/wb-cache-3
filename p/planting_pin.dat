This study was conducted to determine whether mid- and understory removal in combination with ground flora vegetation control would result in a sufficient increase in light to foster the development of pin oak (Quercus palustris Muenchh.) advance reproduction without releasing non-oak competitors. Implementation of three artificial regeneration treatments (direct seeding pin oak acorns, planting 1 - 0 pin oak bareroot seedlings, and <b>planting</b> <b>pin</b> oak RPMP®P seedlings) was also conducted on these same bottomland forest sites in southeastern Missouri. The mid- and understory removal treatment increased the amount of photosynthetically active radiation reaching the understory from 3 percent of full sunlight to 16 percent of full sunlight. This increase in light led to an increase in the proportion of pin oak advance reproduction present in the understory from 1. 5 percent of all advance reproduction in control areas to 28. 1 percent in removal treatment areas. Ground flora control had a negative influence on the proportion of advance reproduction as well as on survival and growth of all reproduction types. After three years, the highest survivals were observed in RPMP®P and bareroot seedlings. The greatest basal diameter growth rates were observed in direct-seeded and natural seedlings and the greatest height growth rates were observed in direct seeded seedlings. RPMP®P and bareroot seedlings were, however, considerably larger than were the natural and direct seeded seedlings...|$|E

Here we show that early endosomal components ARF GEF BEN 1 and newly identified Sec 1 /Munc 18 family protein BEN 2 are involved in distinct steps of early endosomal trafficking. BEN 1 and BEN 2 are collectively required for polar PIN localization, for their dynamic repolarization, and consequently for auxin activity gradient formation and auxin-related developmental processes including embryonic patterning, organogenesis, and vasculature venation patterning. These results show that early endosomal trafficking is crucial for cell polarity and auxin-dependent regulation of plant architecture...|$|R

40|$|Phytohormone auxin and its {{directional}} distribution plays {{an essential role}} in the regulation of numerous processes during vegetative and reproductive plant development. Regulation of the expression, localization and activity of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins is important for proper polar auxin transport in <b>plant</b> tissues. <b>PIN</b> proteins have been described as the major auxin efflux carriers regulating auxin's directional flow to build up gradients that provide information for the coordination of <b>plant</b> development. <b>PIN</b> protein structure topology prediction through bioinformatic analysis is still insufficient to understand their transport mechanism. Experimental analysis of PIN protein domains can provide valuable insight into understanding their role in mediating auxin transport. In this study, the C-terminal part of PINs have been modified by gradual trimming to determine the existence of relevant functional domains, which could be important for auxin transport. Seven modified PIN proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum were prepared. Transiently transformed tobacco cell line Bright Yellow- 2 (BY- 2) was used to monitor differences in PIN transport activity. This approach allowed indirect monitoring of intracellular auxin levels using the DR 5 reporter system. Transiently expressed [...] ...|$|R

50|$|In <b>plants,</b> the <b>PIN</b> {{proteins}} {{are integral}} membrane proteins that transport the anionic {{form of the}} phytohormone auxin across membranes. Most of the PIN proteins (e.g. PIN1/2/3/4/7 in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana) localize at the plasma membrane (PM) where they serve as secondary active transporters involved in the efflux of auxin. The PM-localized PIN proteins show asymmetrical localisations on the membrane and are therefore responsible for polar auxin transport. Some {{other members of the}} PIN family (e.g. PIN5 and 8 in Arabidopsis) localize mostly at the ER-membrane or have a dual PM and ER localisation (e.g. PIN6 in Arabidopsis). These PIN proteins regulate the partitioning of auxin within the cell.|$|R

This study aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying the effects of glycerol on root development in Arabidopsis thaliana. Exogenous glycerol inhibited primary root growth and altered lateral root development in wild-type plants. These phenotypes appeared concurrently with increased endogenous glycerol- 3 -phosphate (G 3 P) and H 2 O 2 contents in seedlings, and decreased phosphate levels in roots. Upon glycerol treatment, G 3 P level and root development did not change in glycerol kinase mutant gli 1, but G 3 P level increased in gpdhc 1 and fad-gpdh mutants, which resulted in more severely impaired root development. Overexpression of the FAD-GPDH gene attenuated the alterations in G 3 P, phosphate and H 2 O 2 levels, leading to increased tolerance to exogenous glycerol, which suggested that FAD-GPDH {{plays an important role in}} modulating this response. Free indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) content increased by 46 %, and DR 5 pro::GUS staining increased in the stele cells of the root meristem under glycerol treatment, suggesting that glycerol likely alters normal auxin distribution. Decreases in PIN 1 and PIN 7 expression, b-glucuronidase (GUS) staining in <b>plants</b> expressing <b>PIN</b> 7 pro::GUS and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence in <b>plants</b> expressing <b>PIN</b> 7 pro::PIN 7 -GFP were observed, indicating that polar auxin transport in the root was downregulated under glycerol treatment.

40|$|Both {{jasmonic acid}} (JA) and its methyl ester, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), {{are thought to}} be {{significant}} components of the signaling pathway regulating the expression of plant defense genes in response to various stresses. JA and MeJA are plant lipid derivatives synthesized from [alpha]-linolenic acid by a lipoxygenase-mediated oxygenation leading to 13 -hydroperoxylinolenic acid, which is subsequently transformed by the action of allene oxide synthase (AOS) and additional modification steps. AOS converts lipoxygenase-derived fatty acid hydroperoxide to allene epoxide, which is the precursor for JA formation. Overexpression of flax AOS cDNA under the regulation of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter in transgenic potato plants led to an increase in the endogenous level of JA. Transgenic plants had six- to 12 -fold higher levels of JA than the nontransformed plants. Increased levels of JA have been observed when potato and tomato plants are mechanically wounded. Under these conditions, the proteinase inhibitor II (pin 2) genes are expressed in the leaves. Despite the fact that the transgenic plants had levels of JA similar to those found in nontransgenic wounded <b>plants,</b> <b>pin</b> 2 genes were not constitutively expressed in the leaves of these plants. Transgenic plants with increased levels of JA did not show changes in water state or in the expression of water stress-responsive genes. Furthermore, the transgenic plants overexpressing the flax AOS gene, and containing elevated levels of JA, responded to wounding or water stress by a further increase in JA and by activating the expression of either wound- or water stress-inducible genes. Protein gel blot analysis demonstrated that the flax-derived AOS protein accumulated in the chloroplasts of the transgenic plants...|$|R

Here, we describe {{the expression of a}} {{proteinase inhibitor}} II (PIN 2) protein from Solanum americanum in phloem of stems, roots and leaves suggesting a novel endogenous role for PIN 2 in phloem. The phloem consists of parenchyma cells, sieve elements (SE), and companion cells (CC) which are in close association with SE. We isolated two cDNAs encoding PIN 2, SaPIN 2 a and SaPIN 2 b, from a S. americanum cDNA library using a tomato PIN 2 cDNA as hybridization probe. SaPIN 2 a shows 73. 6 % identity to SaPIN 2 b. Southern blot analysis confirmed that two genes occur in S. americanum. Northern blot analysis showed that both are wound-inducible and are expressed in flowers. Unlike SaPIN 2 b and other previously characterized <b>plant</b> <b>PIN</b> 2 proteins, SaPIN 2 a is abundantly expressed in stems. In situ hybridization studies on stem sections showed that SaPIN 2 a mRNA is expressed in CC and some SE, likely the immature developing SE, of external and internal phloem. Western blot analysis using SaPIN 2 a-specific antibodies showed SaPIN 2 a accumulation in stems, leaf midribs and fruits. Immunohistochemical localization, using these antibodies, revealed SaPIN 2 a expression in external and internal phloem of stem. Immunoelectron microscopy of stem, root and leaf sections further localized SaPIN 2 a to the CC and predominantly to the SE, particularly the parietal cytoplasm adjacent to the cell wall, the lumen and the sieve-area pores. These results suggest that, other than a possible role in plant defense, SaPIN 2 a could be involved in regulating proteolysis in the SE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|PIN 1 {{participates in}} the {{regulation}} {{of a number of}} signalling pathways in the cell involving protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Its role seems to be an essential control level in addition to the protein phosphorylation by proline-directed kinases. Its cellular function includes regulation of the cell cycle by interaction with phosphorylated mitotic proteins such as Cdc 25 and transcription factors such as p 53. PIN 1 was shown {{to be involved in the}} malignant transformation of cells in breast cancer, by up regulation of cyclinD 1 and is thought to be involved in the development of the AD by regulating the function of phosphorylated Tau. We propose here to discuss the molecular function of PIN 1 at the atomic level based on data from the recent literature and our own results obtained by the technique of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. PIN 1 specifically interacts with pThr/pSer-Pro motifs and is constituted by two domains: a WW N-terminal domain that binds pThr/pSer-Pro epitopes and a prolyl cis/trans isomerase C-terminal catalytic domain. An exception to this organisation is found in the <b>plant</b> <b>PIN</b> 1 homologous enzymes, like PIN 1 At from Arabidopsis thaliana, that are constituted of the sole catalytic domain. The molecular function of PIN 1, binding to and isomerization of pThr/pSer-Pro bonds, are thought to lead to several functional consequences. In a first mode of action, exemplified by its competition with the CKS protein, the interaction with PIN 1 prevents interaction with other regulatory proteins, like ubiquitin-ligases that lead to degradation pathways. In a second mode of action, the idea is largely accepted that the local isomerization modifies the global conformation of the protein substrate and hence its intrinsic activity, although this has never been directly demonstrated. Finally, isomerization catalysis is thought to regulate the (de) phosphorylation of specific pThr/pSer-Pro motifs, exemplified by the stimulation of the dephosphorylation of pThr 231 of Tau by the PP 2 A phosphatase.

Here, we show that PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. Conditional gain-of-function alleles and quantitative measurements of auxin accumulation in Arabidopsis and tobacco cultured cells revealed that the action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGP, rate-limiting, specific to auxins, and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. This suggests a direct involvement of PINs in catalyzing cellular auxin efflux...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate the phenology, features of distyly, reproductive biology, and floral visitors of Psychotria goyazensis Mull. Arg. (Rubiaceae), an intramorph self-compatible species, in a tropical semideciduous forest in the municipality of Catalão, located {{in the state of}} Goiás, Brazil. The phenology was recorded for a sample of individuals, the floral morphology being described using fresh and fixed material. The incompatibility system was tested using controlled hand pollinations. Floral visitors were collected and identified. Blooming began in November 2009 and ended in April 2010. Fruits developed from December 2009 to March 2010.

The main flower visitors were Systropus sp. (Diptera), as well as Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera species.

40|$|The {{expression}} of the potato and tomato proteinase inhibitor II (pin 2) gene family is subject to both developmental and environmental control, being constitutively expressed in potato tubers while only being present in the foliage of the potato or tomato plants after mechanical damage. There {{is evidence that the}} phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in this wound induction of pin 2 gene expression. This paper describes experiments that demonstrate that ABA is able to induce the {{expression of}} the pin 2 gene family, both locally and systemically, at physiological concentrations. The significance of the ABA involvement in the pin 2 induction upon wounding has been further strengthened by analyzing the expression of a pin 2 promoter-[beta]-glucuronidase gene fusion in transgenic ABA-deficient mutant potato plants. We have analyzed the developmental regulation of pin 2 gene expression in wild-type and ABA-deficient potato and tomato <b>plants.</b> The <b>pin</b> 2 mRNA level is identical in mutant and wild-type parental Solanum phureja tubers. In addition, evidence is presented for pin 2 also being constitutively expressed at certain stages in the development of both tomato and potato flowers.

40|$|The {{phytohormone}} auxin induces or represses growth {{depending on}} its concentration {{and the underlying}} tissue type. However, it remains unknown how auxin signalling is modulated to allow tissues transiting between repression and promotion of growth.

PILS proteins reduce nuclear auxin signalling in the apical hook, leading to the de-repression of growth and the onset of hook opening. We also show that the phytochrome (phy) B-reliant light-signalling pathway directly regulates PILS gene activity, thereby enabling light perception to repress nuclear auxin signalling and to control growth. We propose a novel mechanism, in which PILS proteins allow external signals to alter tissue sensitivity to auxin, defining differential growth rates...|$|R
40|$|Five {{interspecific}} hybrids {{were produced}} between Fagopyrum cymosum {{and other species}} (F. esculentum, F. tataricum, F. homotropicum, F. pilus, self-pollinating <b>pin</b> <b>plants</b> and self-pollinating homostyle plants of self-pollinating buckwheat through embryo rescue. Interspecific hybridization with related perennial species would offer the opportunity to introgress perennial and other new, usefull characters into F. esculentum. An in vitro embryo rescue procedure, developed previously to obtain interspecific hybrids of self-pollinating, {{was used in this}} study with modifications in two culture media. Hybrids embryos at the early heart stage were dissected from the embryo 5 and 7 days after pollination and cultivated in vitro. Hybrids plants were suc-cessfully more obtained by culturing the embryos on MS media supplemented with IAA (0. 2 mg/l) +BA (2 mg/I). The hybridity was confirmed by morphology anaiysis. The F 1 hybrid plants were partially fertile, late-maturing, and intermediate between the two parents with respect to characters such as flower shape and plant height. However, the rate of seed set was low. This new hybrid combination may be useful for the future improvement of self-pollinating buckwheat, if the sterility barrier can be overcome...|$|R
40|$|Constitutive endocytic {{recycling}} {{is a crucial}} mechanism allowing regulation of the activity of proteins at the plasma membrane and for rapid changes in their localization, as demonstrated in <b>plants</b> for PIN-FORMED (<b>PIN)</b> proteins, the auxin transporters. To identify novel molecular components of endocytic recycling, mainly exocytosis, we designed a PIN 1 -green fluorescent protein fluorescence imaging-based forward genetic screen for Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that showed increased intracellular accumulation of cargos {{in response to the}} trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA). We identified bex 5 (for BFA-visualized exocytic trafficking defective), a novel dominant mutant carrying a missense mutation that disrupts a conserved sequence motif of the small GTPase, RAS GENES FROM RAT BRAINA 1 b. bex 5 displays defects such as enhanced protein accumulation in abnormal BFA compartments, aberrant endosomes, and defective exocytosis and transcytosis. BEX 5 /RabA 1 b localizes to trans-Golgi network/early endosomes (TGN/EE) and acts on distinct trafficking processes like those regulated by GTP exchange factors on ADP-ribosylation factors GNOM-LIKE 1 and HOPM INTERACTOR 7 /BFA-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE 1, which regulate trafficking at the Golgi apparatus and TGN/EE, respectively. All together, this study identifies Arabidopsis BEX 5 /RabA 1 b as a novel regulator of protein trafficking from a TGN/EE compartment to the plasma membrane...|$|R
40|$|In view {{of their}} {{predominant}} sessile lifestyle, plants {{need to be able}} to adapt to changes in their environment. Environmental signals such as light and gravity modulate plant growth and architecture by redirecting polar cell-to-cell transport of auxin, thus causing changes in the distribution of this <b>plant</b> hormone. The <b>PIN</b> auxin efflux carriers are key drivers of auxin transport that determine the direction of auxin flow through their asymmetric subcellular distribution. An important component in PIN polarity establishment is the plant protein kinase PINOID (PID). PID instructs apical (shoot meristem facing) PIN polarity by phosphorylating the central hydrophylic loop of PIN proteins (PINHL). In this thesis we investigated modulation of PID activity by the calcium binding proteins TCH 3 and PBP 1, and by the protein kinase PDK 1. All three proteins were found to regulate both the enzymatic activity and the sub-cellular localisation of PID in response to calcium and phospholipids, respectively, and as such they are likely to be involved in translating environmental signals into PIN polarity changes. In addition, we show that PID and its close homologs act both redundantly and differentially in orienting plant development by instructing the subcellular distribution of PINs. Promotor: P. J. J.

40|$|Cell {{polarity}} establishment, maintenance, and alteration {{are central}} to the developmental and response programs of nearly all organisms and are often implicated in abnormalities ranging from patterning defects to cancer. By residing at the distinct plasma membrane domains polar cargoes mark the identities of those domains, and execute localized functions. Polar cargoes are recruited to the specialized membrane domains by directional secretion and/or directional endocytic recycling. In plants, auxin efflux carrier PIN proteins display polar localizations in various cell types and play major roles in directional cell-to-cell transport of signaling molecule auxin that is vital for plant patterning and response programs. Recent advanced microscopy studies applied to single cells in intact <b>plants</b> reveal subcellular <b>PIN</b> dynamics. They uncover the PIN polarity generation mechanism and identified important roles of AGC kinases for polar PIN localization. AGC kinase family members PINOID, WAG 1, and WAG 2, belonging to the AGC- 3 subclass predominantly influence the polar localization of PINs. The emerging mechanism for AGC- 3 kinases action suggests that kinases phosphorylate PINs mainly at the plasma membrane after initial symmetric PIN secretion for eventual PIN internalization and PIN sorting into distinct ARF-GEF-regulated polar recycling pathways. Thus phosphorylation status directs PIN translocation to different cell sides. Based on these findings a mechanistic framework evolves that suggests existence of cell side-specific recycling pathways in plants and implicates AGC 3 kinases for differential PIN recruitment among them for eventual PIN polarity establishment, maintenance, and alteration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableSouthwestern corn borer (SWBC) {{and fall}} {{armyworm}} (FAW) feeding on maize causes extensive crop {{damage in the}} United States. Total crop loss is valued at approximately 300 million dollars annually. Previous proteomic analysis comparing resistant and susceptible lines of maize has shown genes found in the photosystem II pathway are highly expressed in the resistant line. The high chlorophyll fluorescence mutants have defects in photosystem I or photosystem II genes. Preliminary feeding trials indicate hcf mutants have resistance to Lepidopteran feeding. A preference test was performed comparing hcf mutants to their wild-type siblings. Oy, pg, and g mutants were also compared to their wild-type siblings {{to ensure that the}} pigmentation was not a factor in insect resistance. Leaf tissue from both the hcf mutant and the wild-type <b>plant</b> were <b>pinned</b> to a piece of moist filter paper within a petri dish. A single SWCB or FAW was placed in between the two samples and allowed to choose which tissue sample it preferred. There were five replicates per genotype. Pictures were taken after four days and tissue damage area was assessed using AlphaEaseFC software. A few hcf mutants showed increased resistance to feeding than their wild-type siblings, while most hcf mutants did not. SWCB preferred the wild-type over hcf 11 -N 1205 A and hcf 49 -N 1480 mutants, indicating these genes may be resistance factors. Some hcf mutants were preferred by SWCB, indicating they may represent susceptibility genes. These genotypes were Oyl-Andrew and hcf 13 -N 1097 B. hcf 49 -N 1480, hcf 7 -N 1029 D, and pg 15 -N 340 B had reduced FAW damage compared to wild-type siblings, indicating they may confer resistance. The genotype hcf 44 -N 1278 B showed increased susceptibility to FAW feeding compared to its wild-type sibling. Further analysis will be needed to examine the resistance capabilities of the hcf 11 -N 1205 A, hcf 7 - 1029 D, pg 15 -N 340 B, and hcf 49 -N 1480 genotypes. The mutants evaluated for effects of pigmentation displayed varying results indicating color differences associated with some hcf mutants are unlikely to be responsible for the differences observed. This experiment has provided data showing that some hcf mutants confer resistance to insect feeding. These genes may be useful in increasing resistance to FAW and SWCB in commercial hybrids.

40|$|Background: This study {{compared}} {{the difference between}} patellofemoral kinematics derived simultaneously from patellar bone pin and skin sensors during full range of tibiofemoral joint movement. Methods: Movements at the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints during passive full extension-flexion of the knees in three un-embalmed human cadavers were studied with four electromagnetic tracking sensors at a sampling rate of 30. Hz. A total of four sensors were attached on distal femur, proximal tibia, {{the surface of a}} tailor-made patella mold and at the tip of a plastic bone <b>pin</b> <b>planted</b> in the patellar body through a window on the mold. Paired-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare peak motions computed from different sensors. The correlation of the movement-time curves derived from different sensors was tested by coefficient of multiple correlations (CMC) in different sections of tibiofemoral joint range. Results: Peak motions detected by skin sensor for patellar lateral tilt (p = 0. 045), distal translation (p = 0. 021), lateral shift (p = 0. 032), and anterior-posterior shift of patella (p = 0. 03 and 0. 01 respectively) were higher than that by the bone pin sensor. The overall CMC values for anterior-posterior translation and medial-lateral shift were lower than movements in other planes of movement. The CMC values in initial range were higher than that in the middle and end range in all planes of movement. Conclusions: Patellofemoral kinematics derived from skin sensors may not be representative of the underlying patellar motion. Kinematics reported from the skin sensors should be carefully interpreted. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
