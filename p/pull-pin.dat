50|$|Tippmann {{offers a}} small line of paintball grenades, all {{using the same}} basic design but coming {{in a variety of}} sizes. Due to the safety hazards and field {{regulations}} of using explosives, they use an expanded bladder filled with a paint mix similar to that in a paintball. To activiate them, the user releases a clasp and throws the grenade, to which releases its contact and spins upon impact. In 2013, Tippmann re-designed their larger grenade, the Big Boy to have a <b>pull-pin</b> type clasp to simulate a real grenade pin.|$|E
40|$|A reevaluation of the Vanguard program {{objectives}} in January 1957 {{resulted in the}} production of the Vanguard I Satellite, a 6. 44 -inch-diameter, 3. 25 -pound sphere with six equally spaced solar cell clusters and six equally spaced antennas mounted on its surface. Experiment requirements necessitated the development of a mechanism to separate the satellite from the third-stage rocket. On the basis of the existing standard separation mechanism, a strap <b>pull-pin</b> girth-ring arrangement was developed. Both the satellite and the separation mechanism were fully tested prior to flight. Successful orbiting and flight operation proved the adequacy of the design.

40|$|Early in the Vanguard program {{it became}} {{apparent}} that a thoroughly reliable means of separating the satellite packages from the third-stage rocket would be required. A completely self -contained standard mechanism was developed with redundant firing circuits for use on both test vehicles and satellite-launching vehicles. A change in the experimental objectives of the test-vehicle payload units necessitated modification of some of the standard separation mechanisms. A strap, <b>pull-pin,</b> girth-ring separation device was developed which employed the basic actuation of the standard mechanisms. Evidence of residual burning of the third stage made it necessary to delay separation longer than the time designed into the long-delay separation device. The standard separation mechanism was modified and integrated with the satellite command receiver system so that a ground command after third-stage burnout would cause separation. Flight performance of the various separation mechanisms proved their reliability; they performed without failure in all Vanguard launchings...|$|E
