Funded {{by a grant from the}} Rockefeller Foundation, the purpose of the investigation was to establish suitable guidelines for the storage and <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> sound <b>recordings</b> for libraries. Conducted at the Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, the study involved subjecting sound recordings to a series of lab tests, from accelerated aging to fungal exposure. Though considered the definitive study in the field, the chemical makeup of plastics and how they perform under stress was the primary focus of the report, whereas playback deterioration—a significant concern to sound archivists and record collectors—was excluded from the investigation.|$|R

40|$|The <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> {{historical}} and contemporary data safeguards our scientific legacy. Bioacoustic recordings can have historical as well as scientific value and should be assessed for their conservation requirements. Unpreserved bioacoustics recordings are generally not referenced and are frequently {{at high risk of}} loss by material degradation and/or by misplacement. In this study we investigated the <b>preservation</b> status <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> natural sound <b>recordings</b> made in Portugal from 1983 until 2010 inclusive. We evaluated the recordings {{on the basis of their}} rate of loss, the degree to which unpreserved recordings could be preserved, and their risk of loss. Recordists of animal sounds were surveyed (by questionnaire or interview) to identify sets <b>of</b> <b>recordings</b> and to collect information on their quality and state <b>of</b> <b>preservation.</b> <b>Of</b> the 78 recordists identified, we found that 32 % <b>of</b> the <b>recordings</b> have an unclear status and that only 9 % <b>of</b> the <b>recordings</b> are lost. <b>Of</b> the c. 6 terabytes <b>of</b> unpreserved sound <b>recordings</b> discovered, an estimated 49 % were recoverable.
