40|$|Abstract- In {{sheet metal}} {{manufacturing}} Design {{and development of}} different components {{is one of the}} important phase. This is a highly complex process and leads to to various uncertainties. These uncertainties can induce heavy manufacturing losses through premature die failure, final part geometric distortion and production risk. Identification of these uncertainties and quantifying them is a challenging job for the designer and FEM based modeling is a very effective tool to overcome the above uncertainties. <b>Progressive</b> <b>die</b> components are modeled in CATIA with selected dimensions for chain link plate. Finite element analysis is conducted for <b>Progressive</b> <b>die</b> obtaining deformation and stresses by using ANSYS software.

50|$|Die {{and punch}} shapes affect the force during the {{punching}} process. The punch force increases {{during the process}} as the entire thickness of the material is sheared at once. A beveled punch helps in the shearing of thicker materials by reducing the force {{at the beginning of}} the stroke. However, beveling a punch will disort the shape because of lateral forces that develop. Compound dies allow multiple shaping to occur. Using compound dies will generally slow down the process and are typically more expensive than other <b>dies.</b> <b>Progressive</b> <b>dies</b> may be used in high production operations. Different punching operations and dies may be used at different stages of the operation on the same machine.|$|R

A <b>progressive</b> <b>die</b> is a multiple station die. In this work authors have designed a <b>progressive</b> <b>die</b> which has two stages of operation.

25|$|The {{greatest}} {{advantage of}} the four-slide machine {{is its ability to}} complete all of the operations required to form the workpiece from start to finish. Moreover, it can handle certain parts that transfer or <b>progressive</b> <b>dies</b> cannot, because it can manipulate from four axes. Due to this flexibility it reduces the cost of the finished part because it requires less machines, setups, and handling. Also, because only one machine is required, less space is required for any given workpiece. As compared to standard stamping presses the tooling is usually inexpensive, due to the simplicity of the tools. A four-slide can usually produce 20,000 to 70,000 finished parts per 16-hour shift, depending on the number of operations per part; this speed usually results in a lower cost per part.|$|R
