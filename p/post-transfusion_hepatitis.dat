40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{define a}} risk profile for <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> C in {{patients}} receiving massive transfusion. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Hepatitis C {{accounts for more}} than 90 % of <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> METHODS: Two-hundred twenty-one of 8, 765 consecutive trauma admissions to a Level I trauma center received more than 20 units of erythrocytes. Sixty-nine survivors had positive viral serologic tests at least 1 year after transfusion. Surrogate testing for hepatitis C using alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (Core) began in October 1986 and January 1987, respectively. Donor blood for group 1 (pre-ALT/Core) was transfused before surrogate screening was introduced. Donor blood for group 2 (post-ALT/Core) was transfused after surrogate screening. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients received blood products from 4, 987 donors (mean, 72. 3 units of exposure). No patient tested positive for antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen, human immunodeficiency virus, or human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1. However 23. 2 % tested positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) as measured by a second-generation enzyme immunoassay (HCV 2. 0) and a recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA), and 21. 7 % tested positive by HCV 1. 0. Antibodies to Core were found in 8. 7 % of patients. The risk for <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> C per unit of exposure is estimated to be 1. 52 % group 1 (pre-ALT/Core) and 0. 239 % for group 2 (post-ALT/Core). CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of ALT/Core donor screening by a blood bank reduced the incidence of <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> C by 84 %. The risk for <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> C depends on units of exposure, screening techniques, and prevalence of hepatitis C in the donor population. In our community, the risk for <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis</b> C is less than 0. 2 % per unit of exposure.

40|$|In 144 {{cases of}} {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma (HCC), 166 cases of cirrhosis without HCC and 142 cases of chronic hepatitis, we examined HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc in sera and compared the following factors between hepatitis B virus marker-negative and -positive patients: age, sex, alcohol consumption, family clustering of liver diseases, and histories of blood transfusion and <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> Results {{of this study}} demonstrated several distinct differences in clinical backgrounds between non-B (negative for HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc) and B (positive for HBsAg) patients with HCC.

40|$|Because the {{majority}} of patients with chronic hepatitis C {{do not respond to}} interferon, alternative treat-ments need to be established. Several lines of evidence suggest that iron depletion is beneficial for such patients. Thus, gastrectomized patients with a reduced capacity for iron absorption might have an advantage in treatment of their liver damage over patients with intact gastrointestinal tracts. Four male gastrectomized patients had <b>post-transfusion</b> chronic <b>hepatitis</b> C. The iron load in three patients was adjusted below 10 ng/ml of serum ferritin level by phlebotomy. Subsequent interferon treat-ment for the four patients without iron load cleared circulating hepatitis C virus RNA in one patient only. However, serum ferritin concentrations were stabilized at low levels without maintenance phlebotomy, and sustained normalization of serum liver enzyme activities was obtained in all four patients. Similar treatments were done for 10 male patients with intact gastrointestinal tracts. The amount of removed iron from these patients was more than that from gastrectomized patients. Interferon also failed to clear circulating hepatitis C virus RNA except in one case. Low ferritin levels and sustained normalization of liver enzymes were seen in three patients. A transient elevation of ferritin levels with low enzyme activities was seen in two patients. Relapsing hepatitis was seen in five of the seven patients who needed maintenance phlebotomy due to a rebound in serum ferritin levels, probably because of active iron absorption from the intestine.

40|$|Hepatitis B {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} <b>post-transfusion</b> infections. Occult <b>hepatitis</b> B infection (OBI) is a form of hepatitis B infection in which, despite the presence of HBV-DNA in the serum and hepatocytes of the carrier, HBsAg is absent. In addition to the risk of transmission through the transfusion of infected blood, reactivation of hepati-tis B in OBI patients and recipients of their blood can lead to cirrhosis, hepatic cancer, and reactivation of viral replication in the carrier. Therefore, effective assays to assess and screen for OBI in blood donors are of paramount importance and require urgent attention. Recently, several investigations in various regions of Iran have reported OBI in blood donors. In response, there has been a drive to apply more specific, sensitive, and accurate methods for the detection of HBV, which should become an obligatory screening process for all blood transfusion services. In this review, we address the progression of occult hepatitis B and the common problems associated with occult hepatitis B worldwide.

Studies were carried out on 256 patients and control subjects from three centres from Northern, Central and Southern Italy (92 nonA-nonC chronic hepatitis, 10 acute non fulminant cryptogenic hepatitis, 41 hepatitis C virus-related chronic hepatitis and 113 blood donors). Serum transfusion transmitted virus was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction using two overlapping sets of primers. Results. A total of 52 of the 92 patients [54. 3 %] with chronic cryptogenic liver disease and 17 of the 41 hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis patients (41. 4 %) were transfusion transmitted virus-DNA positive. Transfusion transmitted virus co-infection in hepatitis C virus patients was not associated with either a higher severity of liver histology or higher alanine transaminase levels or signs of cholestasis. transfusion transmitted virus was found In 48 out of 113 (42. 4 %) blood donors.

As a blood-borne virus, HCV is widely recognized as a major causative agent of <b>post-transfusion</b> non-A, non-B <b>hepatitis.</b> The prevalence of HCV and the distribution of HCV genotypes in Sri Lanka in comparison with the rest of Asia are not well known. Materials and Methods: The blood samples collected from healthy blood donors at the National Blood Transfusion Centre of Sri Lanka were screened to determine the prevalence and the genotypes of HCV among blood donors in Sri Lanka. Results: HCV antibodies were found in 53 of 4980 blood donors. However, of the 53 only 8 positive results were confirmed by Reverse Transcription-PCR, which suggests frequent false-positive results or viral clearance. The PCR positive samples were genotyped by DNA sequencing of the Core/E 1 regions of HCV genome, and all the HCV viruses belonged to genotype 3, of which 7 were 3 a and 1 was 3 b.

Group I consisted of 334 patients with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels below 200 IU/l at presentation. Of these, 29 (8. 7 %) patients developed 32 episodes of acute exacerbation during follow-up., The cumulative probabilities of developing exacerbations were 6. 3 % and 15 % at the end of 1 and 4 years, respectively. Group II included 52 patients with ALT levels above 200 IU/l at presentation. Of these, 19 (37 %) patients developed 26 episodes of exacerbation during follow-up. The cumulative probabilities of developing exacerbations were 24 % and 47 % at the end of 1 and 4 years, respectively. In both groups, the probability of developing exacerbations was slightly higher in men and significantly higher in those above the age of 20 and those who were HBeAg positive. Logistic regression analysis showed that HBeAg positivity (p 200 IU/l) at presentation (p < 0. 0001) and male sex (p = 0. 03) were associated with a significantly higher probability of developing exacerbations.

40|$|<b>POST-TRANSFUSION</b> <b>HEPATITIS</b> is {{a serious}} and {{frequent}} complication in patients treated with clotting factor con-centrates made from plasma pooled from {{a large number of}} donors. The occurrence is close to 100 % in hemophili-acs who have not previously received blood or blood de-rivatives (first-exposure patients) (1 - 3). Recently, sever-al manufacturers of concentrate have developed physical or chemical methods that remove or inactivate viruses with little or no loss of clotting factor activity. One man-ufacturer has added hydrophobic interaction chromatog-raphy on octanohydrazide-agarose to the regular frac-tionation process of a commercial concentrate of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X (4).

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{dissertation}} is the work I carried out at the Università degli Studi di Padova {{in collaboration with the}} CRS (Centro Ricerche Scientifiche) Dott. Dino Paladin, where I conducted part of the project. The CRS Dott. Dino Paladin is a center specialized in biotechnology research and that collaborates with AB ANALITICA srl for the commercialization of the developed diagnostic CE IVD devices. My PhD project is focused on the development of a standardized and performing procedure for the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotyping. HCV is a small, enveloped, positive sense single-strand RNA virus belonging to Flaviviridae family and it is the etiologic agent of the so called <b>post-transfusion</b> non-A, non-B <b>hepatitis.</b> The World Health Organization (WHO) evaluates more than 130 - 150 million of persons worldwide that are chronically HCV infected, and the morbidity and mortality attributable to HCV infection continues to increase. Although the research aims to formulate a pangenotypic anti-viral regimen, nowadays the HCV genotype information is still required to choose the best anti-viral treatment for the patient. Because of the high demand for this type of analysis, we decided to design and develop a high-throughput process for the HCV genotyping, starting from the clinical sample up to the genotype result. In the first part of my PhD work, I dealt with the development of an automated process for the extraction of pathogen nucleic acids. In particular, we developed the GENEQUALITY X 120 Pathogen kit to use with the automated platform GENEQUALITY X 120 (AB ANALITICA srl). This kit revealed extraction efficiency for both pathogen DNA and RNA and therefore it has been chosen for the HCV RNA extractions. In the second part of my study, I focused on the performance evaluation of the AMPLIQUALITY HCV TYPE PLUS device, which is a kit based on a Reverse Line Blot (RLB) technique intended for the genotyping of HCV. The results revealed genotyping and subtyping efficiency. The developed kits are currently CE IVD marked and commercialized. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} in 1989 of hepatitis C virus (HCV) as the infectious agent {{responsible for the}} vast majority of <b>post-transfusion</b> non-A non-B <b>hepatitis,</b> blood transfusions are no longer a source for HCV transmission in Sweden. Anti-HCV testing was implemented for all blood donations in 1992. Since then intravenous drug use (IDU) has become the major route of transmission in the western world. Six genotypes and more than 80 subtypes of HCV have now been identified world-wide. These genotypes and subtypes are determined by genetic divergences between the HCV strains. Subtypes 1 a, 1 b, 2 b, 2 c, and 3 a have global spread, while the other subtypes have a more limited geographical distribution. Little was known on the prevalence of HCV among blood donors and on which genotypes and subtypes of HCV were circulating in Sweden before the testing of all blood donations was implemented. The prevalence of anti-HCV was therefore investigated in sera sent to the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI) from 412 patients; 241 were sampled between 1970 and 1991 before the universal screening in 1992, while 171 were sampled between 1992 and 2002. The samples derived from 193 (47 %) blood donors, (104 sampled before, and 89 after 1992), and from seven other groups of patients. Two groups had suspected known routes of infection, intravenous drug use (IDU) 33 patients and hemodialysis, 16 patients, while it was unknown for the other patients. Anti-HCV was detected in 120 (29 %) samples. The highest frequency was found among IDUs, (91 %). Before general screening was implemented, 2. 8 % of the blood donors were positive for hepatitis C, whereas 28 % of those sampled after 1992 were anti-HCV positive. Those latter samples were sent to SMI due to anti-HCV reactivity in a primary test at the blood centre. HCV RNA could be detected by PCR in 56 (47 %) of the anti-HCV positive samples, the subtype could be determined by sequencing in 45 (80 %) of those. The subtypes found were 1 a in 31 %, 1 b in 18 %, 2 b in 22 %, and 3 a in 27 %. One sample was of subtype 2 c. There was a tendency of increase of genotype 2 and a decrease in subtype 1 a with time. 1 a was found in 38 % of the samples collected before 1992, while it was only found in 19 % of the samples from 1992 or later. On the other hand genotype 2 was found in 17 % sera sampled before 1992 and in 37 % of the samples collected 1992 or later. It is not known if this genotype has recently been introduced into Sweden. Further analysis on larger series of samples is needed to confirm these preliminary results. AcknowledgmentsI would like to express my gratitude to several people who have been supportive in different ways throughout this project. First of all, I want to thank my supervisor Helene Norder, for giving me the possibility to do my diploma thesis at the Department of Virology, Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease control (SMI) and for helping me during this study and for the many insightful conversations during the design and development stages of the application, and also for the many helpful comments and suggestions on the text of the thesis. I want to express my appreciation to my laboratory supervisor Regina Wallin, Camilla Jern and Josefine Ederth for helping me during the procedure for this study. Then, I want to thank my examiner Magnus Johansson from the Södertörns university collegefor his advice on writing this paper. Finally, I would like to thank my family and specially my mother Bahar Hamid for always supporting me during my whole life. Last, but not least, I would like to thank my friends Annika Andersson and Yourdons Yemane for being encouraging, understanding and always supportive...|$|R
40|$|For {{the period}} May 1973 to August 1974 inclusive, the mean {{prevalence}} of hepatitis B antigenemia (HBsAg) in all Canadian provinces (per 100, 000 population) was, for "first-time" donors, 242 and, for "repeat" donors, 77. A modification of counterimmunoelectrophoresis {{was used in}} all 16 regional transfusion centres. The findings confirm the previously noted high prevalence for the Province of Québec and the continuing relatively high prevalence for Canada. The prevalence of HBsAg among donors could be lessened by institution of the following measures: development of a more effective technique for the screening of hepatitis carriers, study of nonparenterally transmitted hepatitis, better reporting of <b>post-transfusion</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> and greater discrimination in prescribing blood and blood components...|$|E
