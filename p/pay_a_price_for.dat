25|$|During the {{previous}} day at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Italy's World Cup hopes seemed to be diminishing fast as goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off with the game still at 0–0. Yet despite this, Italy {{was still able to}} salvage an important 1–0 victory. Norway would ultimately <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> their inability to take advantage of Pagliuca's dismissal. With the four teams level on points, the final two group games would each have to finish as draws for things to stay that way. Republic of Ireland made it through after a dreary 0–0 draw with Norway; midfielders Massaro and Bernal traded strikes as Italy and Mexico played to a 1–1 draw.|$|E

They also wrote that Picard was not required to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> his resurrection at the hands of Q due to [...] "popular narrative being what it is". In Atara Stein's The Byronic Hero in Film, Fiction, and Television, the author describes [...] "Tapestry" [...] as showing a change in Q from his usual satanic stance and instead taking on the role of Picard's guardian angel. Stein also references the alien's increasing influence on the personal lives of the Enterprise crew, a path which Q began in the episode [...] "Hide and Q".|$|E
2500|$|At its outbreak, the war enjoyed support {{across the}} nation. However, Whig Congressman Columbus Delano accused Polk of {{engineering}} the war, and Whig {{resistance to the}} war spread. In August 1846, Polk asked Congress to appropriate $2 million as a down payment for the potential purchase of California. Polk's request ignited opposition to the war, as Polk had never before made public his desire to annex parts of Mexico (aside from lands claimed by Texas). A freshman Democratic Congressman, David Wilmot of Pennsylvania, offered {{an amendment to the}} bill that would ban slavery in any newly acquired lands. The [...] "Wilmot Proviso", as it became known, injected the slavery debate into the Mexican-American War. The appropriation bill, with the Wilmot Proviso attached, passed the House in an 87–64 vote, but the bill died in the Senate. Polk's Democrats would <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> the resistance to the war and the growing issue of slavery, as Democrats lost control of the House in the 1846 elections. However, in early 1847, Polk was successful in passing a bill raising further regiments, and he also finally won approval for the money he wanted to use for the purchase of California.|$|E

60|$|On {{the morning}} when the final results of all the {{examinations}} were to be posted {{on the bulletin board}} at Queen's, Anne and Jane walked down the street together.

For we <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> everything we get or take in this world; and although ambitions are well worth having, they are not to be cheaply won, but exact their dues of work and self-denial, anxiety and discouragement.

Beyond those ten minutes there did not seem, just then, to be anything worth being called Time.|$|E
60|$|I had not {{the least}} belief, in the outset of this story, that the unknown was {{anything}} but a delusion of Mr. Dick's, {{and one of the}} line of that ill-fated Prince who occasioned him so much difficulty; but after some reflection I began to entertain the question whether an attempt, or threat of an attempt, might have been twice made to take poor Mr. Dick himself from under my aunt's protection, and whether my aunt, the strength of whose kind feeling towards him I knew from herself, might have been induced to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> his peace and quiet.

60|$|The {{era of the}} Wild Apple {{will soon}} be past. It is a fruit which will {{probably}} become extinct in New England. You may still wander through old orchards of native fruit of great extent, which {{for the most part}} went to the cider-mill, now all gone to decay. I have heard of an orchard in a distant town, {{on the side of a}} hill, where the apples rolled down and lay four feet deep against a wall on the lower side, and this the owner cut down for fear they should be made into cider. Since the temperance reform and the general introduction of grafted fruit, no native apple-trees, such as I see everywhere in deserted pastures, and where the woods have grown up around them, are set out. I fear that he who walks over these fields a century hence will not know the pleasure of knocking off wild apples. Ah, poor man, there are many pleasures which he will not know! Notwithstanding the prevalence of the Baldwin and the Porter, I doubt if so extensive orchards are set out to-day in my town as there were a century ago, when those vast straggling cider-orchards were planted, when men both ate and drank apples, when the pomace-heap was the only nursery, and trees cost nothing but the trouble of setting them out. Men could afford then to stick a tree by every wall-side and let it take its chance. I see nobody planting trees to-day in such out-of-the-way places, along the lonely roads and lanes, and at the bottom of dells in the wood. Now that they have grafted trees, and <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> them, they collect them into a plat by their houses, and fence them in,--and the end of it all will be that we shall be compelled to look for our apples in a barrel.|$|E

'Tis all right and good, I doubt not: but it is very dreary; as dreary as these black fir-forests, and brown snake fences, and that dreadful, dreadful Canadian winter which is past, which went to my very heart, day after day, like a sword of ice. Another such winter, and I shall die, as one of my own humming-birds would die, did you cage him here, and prevent him from fleeing home to the sunny South when the first leaves begin to fall. Dear children of the sun! my heart goes forth to them; and the whir of their wings is music to me, for it tells me of the South, the glaring South, with its glorious flowers, and glorious woods, its luxuriance, life, fierce enjoyments--let fierce sorrows come with them, if it must be so! Let me take the evil with the good, and live my rich wild life through bliss and agony, like a true daughter of the sun, instead of crystallising slowly here into ice, amid countenances rigid with respectability, sharpened by the lust of gain; without taste, without emotion, without even sorrow! Let who will be the stagnant mill-head, crawling in its ugly spade-cut ditch to turn the mill. Let me be the wild mountain brook, which foams and flashes over the rocks--what if they tear it?--it leaps them nevertheless, and goes laughing on its way. Let me go thus, for weal or woe! And if I sleep awhile, let it be like the brook, beneath the shade of fragrant magnolias and luxuriant vines, and image, meanwhile, in my bosom nothing but the beauty around.|$|E
