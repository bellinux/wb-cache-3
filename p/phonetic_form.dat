500|$|Echmarcach {{appears to}} first {{emerge in the}} {{historical}} record {{in the first half}} of the eleventh century, when he was one of the three kings who met with Knútr Sveinnsson (died 1035), ruler of the Anglo-Scandinavian Empire comprising the kingdoms of Denmark, England, and Norway. The event itself is noted by Knútsdrápa, a contemporary drápa composed by Sigvatr Þórðarson, an eleventh-century Icelandic skald. Although Sigvatr's composition fails to identify the three kings by name, it does reveal that Knútr met them in Fife. The ninthtwelfth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also notes the meeting. The [...] "D" [...] version of the chronicle records that Knútr went to Rome in 1031, and soon after travelled to Scotland where he received the submission of an unnamed Scottish king. The later [...] "E" [...] version provides more information, stating that, after his return from Rome in 1031, Knútr went to Scotland and received the submission of three kings named: [...] "Mælcolm", [...] "Mælbæþe", and [...] "Iehmarc". The latter name appears to be a <b>phonetic</b> <b>form</b> of the Gaelic Echmarcach, a relatively uncommon name.

I argue that we should discipline ourselves to keeping to a purely technical description of any form (practice); that will then make it possible unambiguously to show how that form contributes to a particular function (action), without presuming the relationship to be exclusive.
