The {{purpose of the}} work: {{the development of the}} mathematical model, algorithm and the design programs of burning the hard fuel wet particles in the furnace chambers with a wiev to improve its economy. The mathematical model for the burning process of the wet brown coal parttcles, has been developed; it allows as distinct from the other models, to consider the following: heating the particles, drying, output of volatile particle, burning out of the coke and thermomechanical deterioration. The utilization of the developed mathematical model allows to optimize the furnace process to obtain the minimum level of heat losses as well as obtain the maximum quantity of the <b>porous</b> <b>coke</b> crumbles. The results of the investigation have been used at the selection of the optimum variant of the furnace chamber reconstruction of the PK- 24 boiler of the ITETs- 10.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of gasification of - 10 + 65 mesh coke {{and coal}} char with O(, 2) and O(, 2) -CO(, 2) mixtures was studied in a continuous, bench scale, jet-fluidized reactor {{over a wide}} range of temperatures (900 (DEGREES) C to 3 ̆e 1400 (DEGREES) C) and bed depths under atmospheric pressure. The measured specific reaction rates of carbon ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 1 gram carbon reacting per gram carbon in the reactor per minute. ^ From experimental data and observations, an isothermal two-zone model was developed which states that the jet-fluidized bed is composed of a lower CO(, 2) -producing, exothermic zone and an upper CO-producing, endothermic zone. Excellent heat transfer inside the jet-fluidized bed provides nearly isothermal operating conditions. The CO(, 2) -C reaction, which occurs on the high internal surface areas of the <b>porous</b> <b>coke</b> or coal char particles, determines the overall gasification rate of carbon. Oxygen in the input gas is consumed by the fast O(, 2) -CO gas phase reaction just outside the particles. The experimental data are well correlated by a rate equation based on the isothermal two-zone model with the CO(, 2) -C reaction as the rate-controlling step. The rate constant k, termed the 2 ̆ 2 overall reactivity coefficient, 2 ̆ 2 is defined as the specific reaction rate of carbon per atmosphere CO(, 2). The overall reactivity coefficients of carbon at various temperatures obtained in this study agree well with those measured independently in a fixed bed reactor, giving an estimated activation energy of 45, 600 cal/mole for both Inland Steel Production coke and Universal Prepared coal char. Thus, the experimental data provide strong evidence that coke or coal char gasification in the jet-fluidized reactor is controlled by the chemical kinetics of the CO(, 2) -C reaction inside the porous particles and that the effects of mass transfer from bulk gas to solids on gasification rate are minimal. ^ This investigation demonstrated that the jet-fluidized reactor system is capable of sustained steady state operation. The reactor had been operated at much higher temperatures than permissible in the conventional fluidized reactor and with a fluidized bed maintained above liquid slag. Substantially higher specific reaction rates were obtained compared to those of the conventional fluidized reactor. Jet-fluidization is a promising new technique with potential new applications in coal gasification and metallurgical reduction. ...|$|E
50|$|Coke is a fuel {{with few}} {{impurities}} {{and a high}} carbon content, usually made from coal. It is the solid carbonaceous material derived from destructive distillation of low-ash, low-sulphur bituminous coal. Cokes made from coal are grey, hard, and <b>porous.</b> While <b>coke</b> can be formed naturally, the commonly used form is synthetic. The form known as petroleum coke, or pet coke, is derived from oil refinery coker units or other cracking processes.|$|R
50|$|The {{water content}} in coke is {{practically}} zero {{at the end}} of the coking process, but it is often water quenched so that it can be transported to the blast furnaces. The <b>porous</b> structure of <b>coke</b> absorbs some water, usually 3-6% of its mass. In more modern coke plants an advanced method of coke cooling uses air quenching.|$|R

The carbonization of some low volatile matter coals {{for the production of}} metallurgical coke in slot type ovens is accompanied by the exertion of pressures on the walls which can be dangerous and destroy the walls. It is generally accepted that coking pressure originates from the volatile matter released from the coal being retained as pressurized vapours trapped within the plastic layer of the carbonizing coal charge. Pressure during carbonization also influences the nature of the carbon texture and the <b>porous</b> structure of <b>coke</b> is strongly dependent on volatile matter release during the plastic stage of the carbonization process. There is therefore a possible association of coking pressure, <b>coke</b> <b>porous</b> structure and <b>coke</b> carbon texture. Seven coals giving a variety of wall pressures, as measured in a movable-wall oven,ranging from safe to dangerously coking, were carbonized in a small laboratory oven. The textural compositions of the resultant cokes were assessed by polarized light microscopy while pore structural parameters were measured by computerized image analysis. The textural compositions varied with volatile matter content of the coals while the porosities varied linearly with the internal gas pressures measured in a single plastic layer. In an attempt to investigate possible relations between the pore structure development and internal gas pressures generated in a single plastic layer, polished surfaces showing the coal-to-coke transformation were prepared after quenching carbonized single-wall oven charges. These surfaces were studied by image analysis techniques to obtain measurements of the pore sizes as carbonization proceeded. Pore sizes generally rose to a maximum within the plastic temperature range before falling to the almost constant value seen in the semicoke. No systematic variation between the pore structure development and the internal gas pressures could be established...|$|R
30|$|Reliable and {{representative}} characterization of {{those aspects of}} coke structure that are pertinent to some coke quality consideration {{can be achieved by}} means of reflected light microscopy coupled with a computerized image analysis system. Special care should be taken for sampling of coke sample for pellet preparation and its polishing. The industrial significances of these measurements in this relationship to such coke properties are strength and reactivity. <b>Coke’s</b> <b>porous</b> structure is a function of both the materials carbonized and the conditions of carbonization and aim of this work was to determine the qualitative influence of some of these factors with a view to use such data for the specific structural characterization. The nature of the coal charge is obviously a major factor in determining the coke structure and in general, low rank high volatile coals with sufficient fluidity to ensure that all components are fused together tend to produce high porosity cokes.|$|R

The size distribution and strength of metallurgical coke are factors vital for the steady and high-efficiency operation of a blast furnace, since these factors govern stack penneability. Coke strength influences the size of lump coke {{not only because of}} size degradation by impact and abrasion during transfer to and descent in the blast furnace, but also because of its influence on the fracture which takes place in the coke layer during carbonisation and the effect this has on the initial mean size and size distribution of the feed coke. Therefore, the elucidation of the relationship between coke strength and the fissure fonnation phenomena is significant. In this study, therefore, the coke strength development during carbonisation has been examined in conjunction with various parameters, such as the degree of carbonisation of the coal, namely the extent or fraction of pyrolytic reaction, and the degree of graphitisation of the coke, as well as carbonisation temperature and heating regime. The <b>porous</b> structure of <b>coke</b> has also been examined with a view to establishing a relation between the porous structure and the coking properties of the coal carbonised. The quality of <b>coke</b> <b>porous</b> structure was evaluated by parameters introduced in this study, i. e., the pore size distribution and pore rugosity factors. A poor porous structure is shown to be associated with high proportion of small pores and pores with a rough surface. These features are considered to stem from poor coking properties and the consequent poor adhesion between coal particles. An attempt has also been made to establish a mathematical model capable of predicting the degree of fissuring of coke during carbonisation by utilising the understandings obtained in this study of the coke strength development during carbonisation and the effect of coal properties on coke strength. Coke samples large enough to facilitate the observation of the degree of fissuring in relation to various coal properties and heating conditions, were made to evaluate the mathematical model and introduce the concept. The concept that fissuring takes place when developing thennal stress exceeds the developing coke strength is demonstrated to be capable to evaluate the effects of coal properties and heating conditions on the degree of fissuring observed...|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} work, cokes made from {{different}} coal blends and straight coals {{with a wide}} range of properties were examined. <b>Coke</b> is highly <b>porous</b> material, which indicates that coke strength is likely to depend on both the pore wall thickness and pore properties such as porosity, radius, shape, pore size distribution. These pore properties have a strong effect on its strength. It was observed that total porosity is important because high porosity indicated a reduction of strength. Pore shape is also a very important parameter; angular edges pores are more prone to stress concentration. The cold strength parameters of coke such as M 40 and M 10 were determined by Micum drum test. The hot strength parameters of coke such as CRI and CSR were determined in accordance of IS 4023 : 1991 standards using Kanthal make equipment. The present study was emphasized on importance of coke structures for coke quality. The effects of the porous structure and the coke matrix strength on the hot and cold strength parameters were evaluated. The <b>porous</b> structure of <b>coke</b> such as was porosity, pore wall thickness, roundness and perimeter was observed by means of reflected light optical microscope through image analysis method. A methodology for measurement of coke structure based on image analysis was developed.|$|R
