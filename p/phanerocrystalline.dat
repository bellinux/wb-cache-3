40|$|Carbon {{and oxygen}} isotope {{analyses}} {{have been performed}} on calcium carbonate samples from flysch rocks collected {{in the south of}} Tolfa and Allumiere villages (Central Italy). Large variation it) delta(18) O occurs from values around + 28 per mil (SMOW), typical of marine carbonates, down to values of about + 9 per mil (SMOW). The lower values are measured on samples collected close to <b>phanerocrystalline</b> carbonate deposits outcropping in the area and interpreted as part of a hydrothermal vein system. delta(13) C does not show large variation, and, aside from a few outliers, falls within a range of 0 and + 2 per mil (PDB). Similar carbon and oxygen isotope spatial relationships between the flysch country rocks and the <b>phanerocrystalline</b> carbonate deposits were determined in a previous study by FERRINI & MASI (1987), who interpreted the O- 18 depletion as due to interaction of the host rock with an aqueous fluid at hydrothermal temperatures below 250 degreesC and with a water to rock ratio progressively increasing toward the carbonate vein. The combined results indicate that hydrothermal fluid temperature largely regulates oxygen isotope variation (and possibly the carbon and oxygen deltas co-variation) with respect to the variation of the water to rock ratio...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe Farmington Quadrangle {{is located}} in west central Maine within the New England Physiographic Province. Meta-sedimentary rocks of the Mid-Paleozoic age {{comprise}} approximately two thirds of this area. The remaining one third reveals <b>phanerocrystalline</b> granite rocks, divided into magmatic and granitized zones. The oldest recognized stratigraphic unit in the Farmington Quadrangle is the Smalls Falls (Parmachenee) Formation. This unit is characterized by dark, maroon stained, thinly bedded, highly sulfidic argillaceous rock with minor intercalated arenaceous and calcareous units. This formation was deposited under anaerobic conditions in closed basins. The Madrid Formation lies above the Smalls Falls Formation and is characterized by intercalated calcerous arenaceous units with some argillaceous and calcareous horizons. Near {{the top of the}} Madrid Formation lies the Dyer Hill Member which is a dark argillaceous rock. The stratigraphic units have been subjected to regional metamorphism. The metamorphism increases from low grade, chlorite intensities in the northern sector of the quadrangle to high grade, sillimanite intensities in the southern region of the quadrangle. Contact thermal metamorphic effects are superimposed on the regional metamorphism in the Clearwater Pluton area. The <b>phanerocrystalline</b> rock bodies are ascribed to extensive transformations of sediments in localized deeper areas of the geosyncline which produced magmatic core areas bordered by granitized and metamorphic zones. Some of the granitic magmatic material has been intruded into the overlying rocks while some has remained essentially in situ. The attitude of the rocks in the quadrangle reflect intense structural deformation. The regional strike of the bes is N. N. E and dips are usually very steep to the N. W. Shear zones both transverse and longitudinal are ubiquitous; there are many drag folds of diverse orientation associated with the shear zones. Pleated folding is suggested as the explanation for the regional structure. Isoclinal folding is held untenable due to the absence of: converging strikes of bes; lack of crests and troughs; and readily identifiable repetition of beds. The late mature topography reflects pre-glacial conditions which were modified by Pleistocene glacial erosion and deposition. The method used to map the less accessable areas of the Farmington Quadrangle was th pace and compass method. Extensive field notes were recorded and evaluated. One hundred and sixty three thin sections were prepared and studied. A geological map and the geological history of the Farmington Quadrangle was developed from these data...|$|E
40|$|The Darwin Granite {{is located}} in the south central portion of the Cambrian Mt. Read Volcanic Belt in western Tasmania. It has been dated at 510 + 64, - 21 Ma by Adams et al. (1985) and is of {{particular}} interest because of it's association with several nearby Cu-Au prospects and its apparent contemporaneous timing with respect to ore formation at the Mt. Lyell mining field. The main aims of this research are to determine the nature and origin of the Darwin Granite, its relationship to the various volcanic suites in the Mt. Read Volcanics, and its relationship to the hydrothermal alteration and copper-gold mineralisation in the district. The Darwin Granite is a highly fractionated <b>phanerocrystalline</b> 1 -Type magnetite series equigranular granite with Suite I characteristics as defined by Crawford et al. (1992). The main pink granite phase is intruded by smaller white leucocratic, <b>phanerocrystalline,</b> equigranular to porphyritic, medium to coarse-grained granodiorite and microgranite phases. GENMIX modeling of major elements and REE data supports a model that the granodiorite and microgranite formed from fractionation of the pink granite phase. Negative £Nd(sooMa) values indicate the Darwin Granite was derived from partial melting of a crustal source. REE patterns and abundances in host Central Volcanic Complex (CVC) rocks have virtually identical Suite I characteristics, but REE and trace element data suggest the Darwin Granite was not comagmatic with the volcanic units and they were sourced from a magma with REE and trace element characteristics similar to the Murchison Granite. A Murchison-like parental granite has not been identified in the study area, although geochemical evidence suggests that such a granite occurs beneath the study area. Numerous small tonnage, relatively high grade copper-gold prospects are located along exposed flanks and subsurface projections of the Darwin Granite. With increasing distance from the granite, ore styles are variable from iron-oxide veins and stockworks containing pyrite and chalcopyrite ± specular-hematite ± magnetite ± tourmaline and quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite veins, to disseminated pyrite-chalcopyrite ± covellite, to veins containing quartz, bornite, neodigenite, chalcopyrite and hematite. At the Jukes Prospect, alteration and ore related assemblages are hosted in coherent dacitic volcanics of the CVC. Mineralisation occurs as disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite, magnetite-pyrite ± tourmaline ± scheelite veins, chalcopyrite-pyrite-magnetite veins, magnetite± chlorite hydrothermal breccias, and quartz-chalcopyrite stringers. Hydrothermal sericite, chlorite and K-feldspar alteration styles occur throughout a 15 km X 3 km zone that extends northward from the Darwin Granite to the Jukes Prospect and regional aeromagnetic data suggests that the Darwin Granite underlies the entire northerly trending belt (Leaman and Richardson, 1989; Payne, 1991; Large et al., 1996). Hydrothermal alteration zones around the Darwin Granite and Jukes Prospect represent different parts of the same hydrothermal system. Hydrofracturing and phreatic brecciation of the cupola region released magmatic-hydrothermal fluids which reacted with country rocks and resulted in a complex zoned alteration system. The inner zone is composed of intense secondary K-feldspar assemblages associated with copper mineralisation and grades outward to zones of chlorite and sericite assemblages. Accessory minerals in the K-feldspar zone include sericite, chlorite, pyrite, magnetite, and chalcopyrite. In the chlorite zone accessory sericite, pyrite, magnetite occur as well as chalcopyrite veins. Initial sericite ± chlorite alteration styles were associated with microfracture and vein formation around and above the granite. Total mass changes at the Jukes Prospect were minor and typically involved replacement of one mineral with another without significant nett mass changes. In sericite altered rocks, K 20 gains effectively balanced A(Na 20 + GaO) depletions (from plagioclase destruction) and total mass changes were small. In K-feldspar altered rocks, K 20 gains were larger and were accompanied by minor Si 02 and Fe 20 3 gains, although the total mass changes were still small (av. 6. 1 gms/ 100 gms). Total mass changes in chlorite altered rocks effectively balance A(K 20 + MgO + Fe 20 3) gains with A(Na 20 + GaO + Si 02) losses. In contrast to the minor mass change at the Jukes Prospect, large mass changes occurred near the Darwin Granite. In the dacites, large gains in Si 02 (+ 80 gms/ 100 gms) accompanied smaller mass gains in Al 20 3, K 20, Ba and Sr, while depletions of Si 02 and Al 20 3 occurred in adjacent andesites. The mass changes observed are explained by invoking a magmatic hydrothermal model in which magmatic fluids exsolved from the Darwin Granite. These fluids mixed with modified seawater in reaction zones around the hotter portions of the upflow or discharge zones and K 20, and Fe 20 3 rich alteration assemblages resulted. Monomineralic vein phases suggest that close {{to the center of the}} hydrothermal system fluids were buffered by water (high volume, water/rock ratio). Farther from the systems centre, polymineralic veins and alteration styles suggest rock buffering due to lower water/rock ratios. The widespread occurrence of tourmaline throughout the Jukes-Darwin area suggests significant B in the mineralising fluids. Boron, in addition to H 20, may have depressed the solidus temperature of the Darwin Granite allowing the ascending granite additional time for cooling and intrusion to a higher crustal level (and a lower lithostatic pressure regime) than otherwise may have occurred. The higher level of intrusion allowed the granite to reach a level at which second boiling occurred releasing enough mechanical energy to fracture host rocks at depths of 4 - 5 km (Burnham and Ohmoto, 1980; Burnham, 1985) consistent with estimated depths of emplacement at Mt Darwin. Whole rock o 180 data for the Darwin Granite is consistent with crystallisation from a magma with o 180 values between 9...|$|E
