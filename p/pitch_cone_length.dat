40|$|In general, a {{hypoid gear}} and a {{spiral bevel gear}} for cars {{are made up of}} a formate gear and a {{generated}} pinion. The tooth shape is tapered tooth. Much practice is required to obtain excellent tooth bearing of the tapered tooth. If we convert a tapered tooth to an equi-depth tooth, it is thought that we could easily obtain practical tooth bearing. To date, however, there is no paper that theoretically analyzes tooth bearing of the equi-depth tooth and actually demonstrates it. Therefore the tapered tooth is still used in cars. Thus, we have studied the gear cutting method of the equi-depth tooth hypoid gear. The tooth surface of the hypoid pinion is generated by the 3 rd gear member. In such a case, it is useful to apply the cutting <b>pitch</b> <b>cone</b> instead of the <b>pitch</b> <b>cone</b> and to change the generating shaft angle to the tooth bearing development of a hypoid gear.

Tip length of up to several microns, tip diameters between 100 and 400 nm and cone half- angles of 3 degree - 50 degree are achieved with typical radii of curvature between 20 and 40 nm. The influence of the major deposition parameters, i. e. electron energy, beam current, deposition time and working distance on the growth rate and shape (<b>length,</b> <b>cone</b> angle and <b>cone</b> <b>length)</b> of the tip, are investigated systematically. It is found that increasing beam current leads to a decrease in length growth probably due to enhanced thermal desorption of adsorbates and reduced sticking coefficients.

40|$|Abstract: A closed type {{crankcase}} ventilation system has been adopted to engines to prevent emission of blow-by gas to atmosphere. In the early closed type {{crankcase ventilation}} system, blow-by gas which contains engine lubricating oil is re-circulated into the intake system. The blow-by gas containing oil mist leads to increased harmful emissions and engine problems. To reduce loss of the engine oil, a highly-efficient oil separation device is required. Principle of a cyclone oil separator is to utilize centrifugal force in the separator and, therefore, oil separator designs depend on rotational flow which causes the centrifugal force. In this paper, flow characteristics and oil separation performances for cyclone type designs are calculated with CFD methodology. In the CFD model, oil particle was injected on a inlet surface with Rosin-Rammler distribution and uniform distribution. The major design parameters considered in the analysis model are inlet area, <b>cone</b> <b>length</b> and outlet depth of the oil separator. As results, reducing inlet area and increasing <b>cone</b> <b>length</b> increase oil separation performance. Changes in outlet depth could avoid interference betwee...|$|R

Cone morphology also changes—small, immature cones have a closed structure of imbricate scales forming a dense shell, resulting in higher bulk density.

These changes in cone morphology alter cone surface area to volume ratio, an important determinant of fuel combustion (van Wagtendonk 2006) for which our cone bulk density measurements serve as a proxy.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study conducted to determine the relative role of genotypic and environmental control over characters of cone morphology and seed weight in black spruce (Picea mariana (MILL.) B. S. P.) A three-stage cluster sampling scheme was adopted with the sampling stages of populations, trees within populations and cones within trees. Nine characters of cone morphology were measured on each cone and mean 1, 000 -seed weight was determined for each tree. Statistical analyses comprised (1) calculation of popula­ tion {{means and standard deviations for}} each character, (2) cone length-cone diameter correlations at the populations and tree levels, (3) hierarchical analyses of variance and (4) comparison of the cone length-cone diameter correlations with similar values obtained six years earlier. Genetic ana­ lyses consisted of (1) calculation of repeatibility with stand­ ard error and confidence limits for each character at the population level as estimates of heritability; and (2) multiple regression analysis for each character. The latter was con­ ducted using the stepwise zig-zag procedure with cone character as the dependent variable and 12 environmental factors together with their squares and first order inter­ actions as independent variables to identify the subset which contributes most to the variation in the character. Though the means and repeatabilities of all characters vary with populations, no geographic trends can be dis­ cerned. Repeatability values have been shown to be good estimates of heritability. All characters are under statisti­ cally significant genotypic as well as environmental con­ trol and the most important subset of the latter has been identified. <b>Cone</b> <b>length,</b> diameter, and oven dry weight as well as dimensions of the middle scale are under strong, and length and width of the base and tip scale, under weak genotypic control.

Beyond 1 deg, color matching indicates little decrease in photopigment with increasing eccentricity, whereas retinal densitometry shows a steep decline in photopigment.
