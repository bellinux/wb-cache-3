50|$|Physiological {{regulation}} of blood glucose, {{as in the}} non-diabetic, would be best. Increased blood glucose levels after a meal is a stimulus for <b>prompt</b> <b>release</b> of insulin from the pancreas.

Even the best diabetic treatment with synthetic human insulin or even insulin analogs, however administered, falls far short of normal glucose control in the non-diabetic.|$|E

The new Mozilla (internally codenamed [...] "Seamonkey") would be a platform for Internet applications, with a fully programmable user interface and a modular architecture. This Mozilla would function equally well as a host for email client, instant messaging client, news client, or any number of other applications.|$|E

The local Mayor was arrested during the fracas but Sauberzweig ordered his <b>prompt</b> <b>release.</b> Ultimately 825 [...] "dark elements" [...] as Sauberzweig called them, were removed from the Division permanently. However this and a falling off in recruitment led to staff problems, and he was constantly complaining to the SS personnel office in Berlin of his urgent need for battalion commanders. On 1 October 1943, Karl-Gustav Sauberzweig was promoted to the rank of SS Brigadeführer and Generalmajor of Waffen SS.|$|E
50|$|By 1880, {{there was}} a {{decrease}} in commitments by the courts, and an effort {{was made by the}} board of trustees for the boys' <b>prompt</b> <b>release</b> once they reach the Honor System. This began to decrease the number of boys house at the institution, and as a result sections of the institution were closed. The salaries of those employed were reduced and duties were consolidated {{in order to reduce the}} number of staff employed. By 1882, all boys and officers were removed from the new addition, built 5 years prior, and placed in the old building. In 1883, various committees visited the Institution to determine the best way to move forward with the reform school and to use the unoccupied buildings. By a vote of the legislature in April 1884, the school was relocated to a temporary location in Westborough while a new campus could be built, and on September 30, 1884, the State Reform School for Boys was renamed the Lyman School school for boys.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{opponents of}} the project like James McPhillips, an attorney, activist, and {{resident}} of the Navy Yard neighborhood, suggest that the fact the report has {{made it into the}} final stage means that CSX, DDOT, and the FHWA have cut corners and collaborated to get the project approved as soon as possible without addressing the concerns of locals. In doing so, the opposition says that the prospect other potentially feasible options that residents would approve of were unfairly ignored, and should have been researched before the impact of the current proposal. The DEIS published by CSX outlines three potential options for tunnel renovation. Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton asked the U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx in April 2014 on behalf of the community to expedite the release of the FEIS to provide closure on the issue, which had been going on 6 years at that point.

40|$|The fluences of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are {{measured}} {{with a variety of}} instruments in different detector energy ranges. A detailed comparison of the implied energy releases of the GRB sample requires, then, an accurate accounting of this diversity in fluence measurements which properly corrects for the redshifting of GRB spectra. Here, we develop a methodology to ``k-correct'' the implied <b>prompt</b> energy <b>release</b> of a GRB to a fixed co-moving bandpass. This allows us to homogenize the <b>prompt</b> energy <b>release</b> of 17 cosmological GRBs (using published redshifts, fluences, and spectra) to two common co-moving bandpasses: 20 - 2000 keV and 0. 1 keV- 10 MeV (``bolometric''). While the overall distribution of GRB energy releases does not change significantly by using a k-correction, we show that uncorrected energy estimates systematically undercounts the bolometric energy by ~ 5 % to 600 %, depending on the particular GRB. We find that the median bolometric isotropic-equivalent <b>prompt</b> energy <b>release</b> is 2. 2 x 10 ^{ 53 } erg with an r. m. s. scatter of 0. 80 dex. The typical estimated uncertainty on a given k-corrected energy measurement is ~ 20 %. Comment: Accepted to the Astronomical Journal. 21 pages (LaTeX) and 4 figure...|$|R

50|$|The more traditional, fixed bomb rack, a {{conventional}} bomb rack {{like that of}} the B-52 would have mounted stores in vertical columns making individual store selection and release impossible without releasing all stores ahead in the column line. The advantage of {{a conventional}} bomb rack is a <b>prompt</b> <b>release</b> of all stores in short order.Bombers like the B-52, the B-1 or the B-2 use custom designed bomb rack support structures with their own designation e.g. Common Bomb Rack (CBR), Common Bomb Module (CBM), or Smart Bomb Rack Assembly (SBRA). These bomb racks may have special store release control mechanisms. Aside from the release options of a rack a pilot can select release mode for releasing one or multiple stores. Stores can be jettisoned selectively in single mode or ripple mode or salvo mode. The term ripple applies to the single- or ripple and single- continuous release mode from one or from mirror stations. Salvo release mode applies to a combination of several stations together e.g. adjacent stations. For multiple store release an interval timer can be set to release stores in fixed time steps. For an external store emergency release there may be a panic button to release all of the weapons.|$|E
40|$|The {{disputes}} {{relating to}} <b>prompt</b> <b>release</b> constitute {{an important part}} of the case law of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. The frequency of the use of <b>prompt</b> <b>release</b> proceedings may be explained by the fact that illegal fisheries have increased owing to the exhaustion of biological resources. Considering that the exhaustion of renewable resources entails a serious problem, conflicts regarding illegal fisheries and the detention of vessels and crews will increase. This study examines the procedure for <b>prompt</b> <b>release</b> under Article 292 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea by focusing on the case law of the Tribunal.

40|$|<b>Prompt</b> <b>Release</b> of Vessels and Crews] The {{article is}} devoted to the {{detailed}} analysis mainly of applicability of this special procedure stipulated in the Article 292 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which is independent from domestic as well as from other international proceedings. <b>Prompt</b> <b>release</b> is considered {{an important part of the}} comprehensive dispute settlement system of the Convention which generally speaking is oriented to accommodate economic and humanitarian as well as safety and environmental concerns of States Parties. This extremely fast international procedure is foreseen as compensation to the flag States against the wide range of coastal States in their exclusive economic zones covering almost one third of the World Ocean. The essence of this Article 292 is that <b>prompt</b> <b>release</b> is applicable where substantive provisions of the Convention specifically foresee the <b>prompt</b> <b>release</b> of detained foreign vessels and their crews upon posting a reasonable bond or other financial security. This procedure is analyzed in the light of the cases before the Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and rights as well as duties of the flag State are discussed.
