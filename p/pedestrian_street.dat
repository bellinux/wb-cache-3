The current national fire safety standards {{do not give}} clear requirements on fire protection design.

It has the second largest number of exits (totalling 17) in the stations of the metro system.|$|E
25|$|The first {{purpose-built}} <b>pedestrian</b> <b>street</b> in Europe is the Lijnbaan in Rotterdam, {{opened in}} 1953. The first pedestrianised shopping centre in the United Kingdom was in Stevenage in 1959. A {{large number of}} European towns and cities have made part of their centres car-free since the early 1960s. These are often accompanied by car parks {{on the edge of}} the pedestrianised zone, and, in the larger cases, park and ride schemes. Central Copenhagen is one of the largest and oldest: It was converted from car traffic into pedestrian zone in 1962.|$|E
25|$|R$67,496,000.00 of the {{municipal}} GDP is from services, currently {{the major source of}} GDP of Águas de São Pedro. A major part of the tertiary sector is tourism, and the city's economy is geared exclusively toward this sector. The municipality of Águas de São Pedro is integrated with the Tourism Region of the Itaqueri Ridge and has as its main attraction its medicinal mineral waters. According to city officials, the new tourism routes go through regionalization. Tourists attracted by the natural attractions also help to stimulate the commercial sector of the city. The busiest retail centres are Carlos Mauro Avenue and Trade Street, which after renovations costing R$302,000.00 has become a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E

25|$|On July 16, 2003, George Russell Weller {{drove his}} Buick at speeds {{of up to}} 70 miles per hour through the busy {{downtown}} Farmers Market, which was held on a city street that was closed to vehicular traffic by temporary signage at each end. The 86-year-old driver killed 10 that day and injured 63, stopping only due the Buick's engine and transmission being clogged with body parts. The city vigorously fought against accepting its responsibility in causing the death and injuries of market patrons through {{the lack of any}} barricade. In the wake of numerous civil lawsuits filed against the City of Santa Monica and the company organizing the Farmer's Market, a new policy was adopted requiring portable concrete barricades to reliably block vehicle access for <b>pedestrian</b> <b>street</b> events.|$|E

40|$|Since 2000, Transport Department {{has been}} {{implementing}} pedestrian schemes in Hong Kong {{to provide a}} comfortable environment for pedestrians. Many {{studies have indicated that}} the retail environment in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> would be enhanced. This study was conducted to understand the theoretical concepts about the effects of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> to retailing. The distribution of different types of retailers in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> and the nearby streets was investigated and the reasons and possible effects of the above findings were also examined. Field survey on business inventory in Mong Kok, Causweay Bay and Sheung Shui was conducted. Descriptive statistics was then used to explain the results and chi-square test was devoted to examining whether types of retailers depend on street types. This study showed that types of retailers depend on street types and provided evidence to support pervious researches that specific retailers including chain stores, merchandise retailing or clothing, jewellery and watches shops tended to located in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> while some businesses including independent shops or shops selling low-end products were not. The impacts of implementing pedestrian schemes on the types of retailers were discussed. Since more visitors are willing to shop in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> due to pleasant environment, retail turnover would usually increase and some investors may want to open shops in the streets to make profits. As a result, property owners would feel more confident to increase the rent of shop to gain more money as the demand of the limited rental street space increases. Those privileged businesses, which can afford higher rent, can open shops in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> so the portion of underprivileged businesses in these streets is lower due to unaffordable rent. The study also indicated few more reasons to explain the distribution of retailers’ types. Accessibility is one the factors that affect the attractiveness of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets,</b> which also impact the retailers’ types. National economic trend and local factors would increase the portion of specific shops while market economy policy from the Government encourage distributing of retailers’ types using market principle. For the economic implications, privileged businesses would dominate <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> and affect economic diversity and businesses in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> would be affected by economic trend. Moreover, property owners can make more money as rents go up. For social implications, products available in <b>pedestrian</b> <b>streets</b> become tourists-oriented and may not meet the local needs and local identity would gradually disappear. Finally, the study suggested the Government could provide space for independent retailers to continue their businesses and encourage underprivileged businesses to enhance their competiveness. Besides, in the policy point of view, the Government should assess the impacts on the distribution of retailers before implementing pedestrian schemes. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignMasterMaster of Science in Urban Plannin...|$|R

500|$|The {{historic}} {{centre of the}} city, Indre By or the Inner City, features many of Copenhagen's most popular monuments and attractions. The area known as Frederiksstaden, developed by Frederik V {{in the second half}} of the 18th century in the Rococo style, has the four mansions of Amalienborg, the royal residence, and the wide-domed Marble Church at its centre. Directly across the water from Amalienborg, the recently completed Copenhagen Opera stands on the island of Holmen. To the south of Frederiksstaden, the Nyhavn canal is lined with colourful houses from the 17th and 18th centuries, many now with lively restaurants and bars. The canal runs from the harbour front to the spacious square of Kongens Nytorv which was laid out by Christian V in 1670. Important buildings include Charlottenborg Palace, famous for its art exhibitions, the Thott Palace (now the French embassy), the Royal Danish Theatre and the Hotel D'Angleterre, dated to 1755. Other landmarks in Indre By include the parliament building of Christiansborg, the City Hall and Rundetårn, originally an observatory. There are also several museums in the area including Thorvaldsen Museum dedicated to the 18th-century sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. Closed to traffic since 1964, Strøget, the world's oldest and longest <b>pedestrian</b> <b>street,</b> runs the [...] from Rådhuspladsen to Kongens Nytorv. With its speciality shops, cafés, restaurants, and buskers, it is always full of life and includes the old squares of Gammel Torv and Amagertorv, each with a fountain. Rosenborg Castle on Øster Voldgade was built by Christian IV in 1606 as a summer residence in the Renaissance style. It houses the Danish crown jewels and crown regalia, the coronation throne and tapestries illustrating Christian V's victories in the Scanian War.|$|E
