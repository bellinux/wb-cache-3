Nevertheless, this effect is limited by time, i. e. innovation profit is limited as well. Limited innovation profit has been already noted by Schumpeter (1934) in his initial works. However, innovations influence all the enterprises processes {{as well as the}} <b>life</b> cycle <b>of</b> a company. From this point of view, innovations are an important factor of value drivers’ development, more over {{it might be possible to}} suppose them to be independent value driver. Objective of the submitted paper is to determine the <b>probable</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> technical innovation's <b>life</b> cycle regarding to value drivers. In the frame of previous researchers, the authors have also proved that the effect of innovations is among others limited also by the branch of economic activities of a business entity...|$|R

40|$|Background and objectives: Most {{studies on}} health inequalities use average measures, but {{describing}} {{the distribution of}} health can also provide valuable knowledge. In this paper, we estimate and compare within-group and between-group inequalities in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> for population groups in Ethiopia in 2000 and 2011. Methods: We used data from the 2011 and 2000 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey and the Global Burden of Disease study 2010, and the MODMATCH modified logit life table system developed by the World Health Organization to model mortality rates, <b>life</b> expectancy, and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> for Ethiopian population groups stratified by wealth quintiles, gender and residence. We then estimated and compared within-group and between-group inequality in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> using the Gini index and absolute <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> inequality. Results: <b>Length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> inequality has decreased and life expectancy has increased for all population groups between 2000 and 2011. <b>Length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> inequality within wealth quintiles is about three {{times larger than the}} between-group inequality of 9 years. Total <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> inequality in Ethiopia was 27. 6 years in 2011. Conclusion: Longevity has increased and the distribution of health in Ethiopia is more equal in 2011 than 2000, with <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> inequality reduced for all population groups. Still there is considerable potential for further improvement. In the Ethiopian context with a poor and highly rural population, inequality in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> within wealth quintiles is considerably larger than between them. This suggests that other factors than wealth substantially contribute to total health inequality in Ethiopia and that identification and quantification of these factors will be important for identifying proper measures to further reduce <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> inequality. </p...|$|R

30|$|The {{existing}} {{studies on}} life expectancy in India mostly discuss {{the differences in}} life expectancy across groups, for example, by sex or gender, rural-urban residence, and between states (James and Syamala 2010; Saikia et al. 2011; Sauvaget et al. 2011). A few studies have also attempted to decompose the changes in life expectancy into the contribution of mortality change in different age groups. The decomposition results reveal that recent improvements in life expectancy in India are mainly due to steeper mortality changes at the younger ages (Saikia et al. 2011; Singh and Ram 2003; Singh and Ladusingh 2010). Studies examining inequality in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in India are limited. Furthermore, {{there is no evidence}} on trends in inequality in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in India. We could come across only one study that has examined trends in temporary life expectancy between ages 0 and 60 in the Indian states (Saikia et al. 2011). The study by Saikia et al. (2011) revealed large reductions in inter-state inequality in temporary life expectancy between the periods 1970 – 1975 and 2000 – 2004. After significant gains in the life expectancy at birth during the 1970 s and the 1980 s in India, the increase has come to a worrying halt. Interestingly, the study by Saikia et al. (2011) did not examine the trends in inequality in different states and subpopulations of India. Furthermore, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, there is no study in India that has examined the individual-based measurement <b>of</b> inequality in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Also, we could not come across any study that has decomposed the changes in inequality in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> into the contribution of causes of deaths. Moreover, India comprises of 29 States and 7 Union Territories (UTs). The various States and UTs are at different levels of socioeconomic development. For example, the southern states—like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu—are way ahead of other States in socioeconomic development. Also, various States/UTs are at different levels of demographic and epidemiological transitions. Therefore, an analysis of India and its states is likely to provide interesting patterns in inequality in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Having said that, the present study examines the trends in inequality in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Moreover, the present study also decomposes the changes in inequality in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> into the contribution of mortality change in different age groups. Finally, we decompose the changes in inequality in <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> into the contribution of causes of death.
