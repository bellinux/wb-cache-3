Since the early 2000s, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador have seen an exponential growth in their murder rates across the board. For reoccurring years, Honduras has been the murder capital of the world with a homicide rate reaching a 91.6 murders per 100,000 people in 2011.  El Salvador also had a high rate in 2011 with a rate of 90 murders per 100,000 people. Guatemala’s rate is not as staggering and has also shifted to a less violent country.  However, El Salvador has seen another surge after 2013, when MS-13 and Barrio 18 broke a truce that propelled people to flee the country.  In El Salvador, homicide rates peaked at 104 murders per 100,000 people in 2015.

How do rural Nebraskans perceive their quality of life? Do their perceptions differ by community size, the region in which they live, or their occupation? This report details 2, 915 responses to the 2004 Nebraska Rural Poll, the ninth annual effort to understand rural Nebraskans’ perceptions. Respondents were asked a series of questions regarding their individual well-being. Trends for these questions are examined by comparing data from the eight previous polls to this year’s results. In addition, comparisons are made among different respondent subgroups, i. e., comparisons by age, occupation, region, etc. Based on these analyses, some key findings emerged: •	 Rural Nebraskans are more positive about their current situation than they were last year. This year, 36 percent believe they are better off then they were five years ago, compared to only 27 percent in 2003. Also, the <b>percent</b> <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> are worse off then they were five years ago decreased from 30 percent to 23 <b>percent.</b> The proportion <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> remained about the same declined slightly from 43 percent to 41 percent. •	 When looking to the future, rural Nebraskans are more positive than they were last year. The proportion believing they will be better off ten years from now increased from 31 percent to 37 percent. Conversely, the proportion that think they will be worse off decreased from 26 percent to 23 <b>percent.</b> The <b>percent</b> <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> will be about the same also decreased from 43 percent to 41 percent. •	 Farmers and ranchers are less optimistic about their future situation than persons with different occupations. Only 38 percent of the farmers and ranchers think they will be better off ten years from now. In comparison, 51 percent of the persons with professional occupations <b>say</b> <b>they</b> will be better off. The farmers and ranchers are the occupation group most likely to <b>say</b> <b>they</b> will remain about the same ten years from now. •	 Persons with lower educational levels are more likely than persons with more education to believe that people are powerless to control their own lives. Fifty-three percent of the persons without a high school diploma agree that people are powerless to control their own lives. However, only 20 percent of the persons with a four-year college degree share this opinion. •	Rural Nebraskans report being most satisfied with their family, their religion/spirituality and friends. They are most dissatisfied with their financial security during retirement, their current income level and their job opportunities. •	Females are more likely than males to report being dissatisfied with their job opportunities. Fifty percent of females are dissatisfied with their job opportunities, compared to only 37 percent of the males...|$|R

How do rural Nebraskans view alternative energy sources? Do they view them as beneficial to the state’s economy? Do they think more electricity should be generated from alternative energy sources? How often do they use ethanol blend fuel? This report details 2, 851 responses to the 2005 Nebraska Rural Poll, the tenth annual effort to understand rural Nebraskans’ perceptions. Respondents were asked a series of questions about alternative energy sources. For all questions, comparisons are made among different respondent subgroups, that is, comparisons by age, occupation, region, etc. Based on these analyses, some key findings emerged: Most rural Nebraskans agree that the government should encourage the use of renewable energy sources. Eighty-nine percent agree or strongly agree with this statement. Only two percent disagree or strongly disagree. Most rural Nebraskans believe alternative energy sources are good for the state’s economy. Eighty-nine percent either strongly agree or agree that generating more electricity through wind power would be good for Nebraska’s economy. Similar proportions believe that producing more ethanol blend fuel (86 %) and more soy biodiesel blend fuel (83 %) would be beneficial to the state’s economy. Opinions are mixed on both the cost and reliability of alternative energy sources. Onethird (33 %) agree or strongly agree that alternative energy sources are more expensive than traditional fossil fuel energy sources (i. e., coal, gas and oil). Twenty-eight percent disagree with this statement and 39 percent have no opinion. When given the statement that traditional fossil fuel energy sources are more reliable than alternative energy sources, 33 percent disagree and 23 percent agree. Forty-four percent of rural Nebraskans have no opinion in this area. Most rural Nebraskans agree or strongly agree that alternative energy sources are better for the environment than traditional fossil fuel energy sources. Sixty-five percent of rural Nebraskans agree with this statement and only four percent disagree. Thirty-one percent have no opinion. Most rural Nebraskans think at least 10 % of the state’s electricity should be generated from alternative energy sources. Seventy-two percent of rural Nebraskans agree with this statement, while only three percent disagree. Twenty-five percent have no opinion. Farmers and ranchers are most likely to agree that the government should encourage the use of renewable energy sources. Ninety-four percent of farmers and ranchers agree with this statement, compared to 84 percent of persons with service occupations. Farmers and ranchers are most likely to agree that producing more soy bio-diesel blend fuel would be good for Nebraska’s economy. Ninety-four percent of farmers and ranchers agree with this statement, compared to 74 percent of manual laborers. Younger persons are more likely than older persons to agree that alternative energy sources are better for the environment than traditional fossil fuel energy sources. Seventy-six percent of persons age 19 to 29 agree with this statement, compared to 52 percent of persons age 65 and older. Over one-half of rural Nebraskans say they always or almost always use an ethanol blend fuel when filling up their vehicle.

Having surveyed three countries (the United States, Canada, and Great Britain), the poll also mentioned that more people believe in haunted houses {{than any of the other}} paranormal items tested, with 37% of Americans, 28% of Canadians, and 40% of Britons believing.|$|R
2500|$|Most steroid {{users are}} not athletes. Between 1 million and 3 million people (1% of the population) {{are thought to}} have misused AAS in the United States. Studies in the United States have shown that AAS users tend to be mostly middle-class {{heterosexual}} men with a median age of about 25 who are noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes and use the drugs for cosmetic purposes. [...] "Among 12- to 17-year-old boys, use of steroids and similar drugs jumped 25 percent from 1999 to 2000, with 20 <b>percent</b> <b>saying</b> <b>they</b> use them for looks rather than sports, a study by insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield found."(Eisenhauer) Another study found that non-medical use of AAS among college students was at or less than 1%. According to a recent survey, 78.4% of steroid users were noncompetitive bodybuilders and non-athletes, while about 13% reported unsafe injection practices such as reusing needles, sharing needles, and sharing multidose vials, though a 2007 study found that sharing of needles was extremely uncommon among individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes, less than 1%. Another 2007 study found that 74% of non-medical AAS users had post-secondary degrees and more had completed college and fewer had failed to complete high school than is expected from the general populace. The same study found that individuals using AAS for non-medical purposes had a higher employment rate and a higher household income than the general population. AAS users tend to research the drugs they are taking more than other controlled-substance users; however, the major sources consulted by steroid users include friends, non-medical handbooks, internet-based forums, blogs, and fitness magazines, which can provide questionable or inaccurate information.|$|R
