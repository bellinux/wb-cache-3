The accounts with Agro Bank Malaysia have been criticised for taking out RM 20 from each account, for processing and ATM card fees.|$|R

Lately some new policies have been adopted. From the European countries, Finland, Malta and Slovenia are the only ones (2006) that use only tax incentives to promote wind energy and other renewable electricity. Finland has no obligations or binding recommendations for the power companies to promote RE.|$|R

The university authorities {{under the influence of the}} military authorities who were seeking to frustrate him had seized his certificate. The implication of this in a society that placed great <b>premium</b> on <b>certificates</b> rather than skills was that he could neither find a job as a graduate in the private sector nor in the public sector. This also meant he could not seek post-graduate studies.|$|R

However, while certificates that use the SHA-1 signature hash algorithm remain available, some certificate authorities continue to issue SGC certificates (often charging a premium for them) although they are obsolete.

40|$|Purpose – Considering the {{popularity}} of the <b>premium</b> savings <b>certificate</b> (PSC) of the National Savings Bank of Malaysia (Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN)) the paper aims to justify the Shari'ah compliancy of this product by analyzing its underlying contracts and to propose a Shari'ah compliant savings certificate, if the current practice is invalid in the Shari'ah. Design/methodology/approach – Inductive methodology is first used to obtain a basic understanding of this product and the characteristics of Shari'ah approved contracts as well as the views of the jurists. Interviewing method is also used to acquire first-hand information when the inductive method is not sufficient. Afterwards, an analytical approach is adopted to justify the validity of this contract with the Shari'ah principles. Finally, an innovative methodology is used to propose a Shari'ah compliant savings certificate. Findings – The paper argues that the underlying contract used in PSC violates the conditions of wadi'ah contract, as in wadi'ah, the bank is not allowed to spend the money for investment, but in practice, BSN uses the money for investment. Therefore, the underlying contract in PSC turns into qard (loan) contract. Since the scholars unanimously declare that giving any kind of benefit like prizes to the creditor is riba, then PSC is considered as invalid according to the Shari'ah. On the other hand, although PSC might seem like gambling, it is different from gambling as the prizes given to PSC are from a third party. The paper proposes implementing mudarabah contract in PSC where the bank is allowed to invest according to its interest and the depositors share the profit and loss but the huge fluctuation of profit and loss could be shrunk by a special fund method. Originality/value – In particular, it attracts the attention of BSN management to change their product's features. In general, it discovers a non-Shari'ah compliant feature of savings certificates and outlines the feature of a Shari'ah compliant saving certificate for the practitioners of Islamic banking all over the world.

40|$|The Food Security Act of 1985 permits {{payment of}} farm program {{benefits}} {{in part with}} PIK certificates. PIK certificates can do things that cash alone cannot do. This special capacity gives PIK certificates special value. A market determined premium has existed for them from the beginning. Briefly during the harvest of 1986, premiums were as high as 30 percent. To date, premiums have rarely been much less than 5 percent. In this paper we will attempt {{to better understand the}} reasons for the PIK <b>certificate</b> <b>premiums</b> and explore an alternate design of the system that would, for the most part, eliminate them. A second objective {{of this paper is to}} understand how the special powers of PIK certificates are capable of changing the market environment itself. The fact that PIK certificates can acquire grain owned by the CCC, in the Farmer Owned Reserve, in the Special Producer Storage Loan Program, or under 9 -month loan at approximately current market prices is an important change in the rules. Previously, CCC inventory had been available to the market only at prices well above the loan rate, with minor exceptions pertaining to the condition of the grain. Farmer Owned Reserve inventory was available at prices at or above a trigger-release price. The traditional 9 -month loan program and the SPSLP tend to support prices at levels above the loan rate plus interest carrying charges. The availability of these supplies to the market via a new set of rules creates a radical new market environment, something closer to a free market (Kennedy) (Westcott and Hanthorn). Additional topics discussed include the role of PIK certificates toward alleviating storage shortages, toward creating a defacto marketing loan, and toward possible USDA control of regional markets.

40|$|Determining which {{countries}} {{are the most}} financially attractive for businesses to build wind projects {{is a matter of}} serious discussion that lacks succinct commentary. To fill this void this paper employs an empirical study of the wind subsidy support systems used by Germany, France, Spain and Sweden. This paper is {{based on the premise that}} businesses prefer to build where they can find the highest overall remuneration for their production; recognizing also the need for stability in those payments and businesses’ strong preference for larger early returns on their investments. The paper also analyzes the results and gives recommendations on possible improvements to each country’s system and where businesses should invest. In order to reach their 20 - 20 - 20 E. U. goals (European Commission, 2010), {{countries are}} encouraging the creation of new green energy projects, and this encouragement is frequently in the form of subsidies. The subsidy types used by the countries reviewed are feed-in tariffs, <b>premiums</b> and a <b>certificate</b> quota system. Each country’s support history is detailed along with the criteria of their respective systems. The countries systems are then compared using actual income and production data for four criteria at three different production levels – 100 percent, 75 percent and 150 percent of actual – and at two different lengths of time, 7 and 20 years. The first criteria of the comparison is total income, the second for variability of payments, the third for timing of payments and the final is the stability of the system itself. The results of this research show that the German and French systems are superior at all levels for their low variability in payment prices and in making larger payments to businesses earlier. They are also generally superior at lower and actual production levels for total income amounts. However, the Spanish options are superior at high levels of production for income and have middling variability levels. The Swedish system generally has the highest levels of variability for the lowest levels of income. Only the Spanish system is considered to be unstable in its political support of subsidies. Based upon the preceding findings are given to each country to improve their relative weaknesses. Also recommendations are given to businesses based upon the quality of the locations wind resources...|$|R
