5|$|A feud began between Shawn Michaels and Mr. <b>Perfect</b> after WrestleMania IX as {{a result}} of Michaels attacking <b>Perfect.</b> They faced each other at SummerSlam 1993, and Michaels won by countout after his new bodyguard, Diesel {{attacked}} <b>Perfect.</b> <b>Perfect</b> then feuded with Diesel until leaving the WWF.|$|E
5|$|The {{match between}} Shawn Michaels and Mr. <b>Perfect</b> {{began with a}} series of wrestling holds. The match {{remained}} primarily technical until Diesel distracted <b>Perfect,</b> allowing Michaels to superkick him in the face. Michaels worked on Perfect's injured back until <b>Perfect</b> took control of the match. After a series of attacks on Michaels, <b>Perfect</b> used the <b>Perfect</b> Plex. Diesel pulled him out of the ring and threw him into the steel ring steps, however, allowing Michaels to win by countout.|$|E
5|$|The twenty days between Braden's <b>perfect</b> {{game and}} Halladay's was the {{shortest}} span between two <b>perfect</b> games since 1880 {{and there was}} a chance {{that for the first time}} in MLB history there would be three <b>perfect</b> games in such short succession. Had Galarraga's game been correctly called, the four-day span since Halladay's <b>perfect</b> game would have broken that 130-year-old record, and marked the only time that three consecutive no-hitters had been <b>perfect</b> games, the only time that three <b>perfect</b> games had occurred in one season (since done in 2012 by Philip Humber, Matt Cain and Félix Hernández), the only time that three <b>perfect</b> games had occurred in a span shorter than a month, the only time four <b>perfect</b> games had occurred in a span shorter than a year (as Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox threw a <b>perfect</b> game in July 2009), and the only time that four <b>perfect</b> games had occurred within a stretch of five no-hitters.|$|E

5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the will. The former are classified as <b>perfect</b> duties, the latter as imperfect. A <b>perfect</b> duty always holds true—there is a <b>perfect</b> duty to tell the truth, so we must never lie. An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that <b>perfect</b> duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the <b>perfect</b> duty must be followed.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} <b>Perfect,</b> and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The <b>Perfect</b> verb form expressed {{the idea of the}} verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a <b>Perfect</b> verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E
5|$|Further aspectual distinctions are encoded {{by the use}} of {{auxiliary}} verbs, primarily {{have and}} be, which encode the contrast between a <b>perfect</b> and non-perfect past tense (I have run vs. I was running), and compound tenses such as preterite <b>perfect</b> (I had been running) and present <b>perfect</b> (I have been running).|$|E

Humber threw only 96 pitches, making this the first <b>perfect</b> game thrown in under 100 pitches since David Cone's <b>perfect</b> game on July 18, 1999. Humber had only started 29 Major League games prior to throwing his <b>perfect</b> game, making him the pitcher with the second fewest starts prior to throwing a <b>perfect</b> game, behind fellow White Sox player Charlie Robertson.

5|$|In {{the next}} contest, Ric Flair and Razor Ramon {{wrestled}} against Mr. <b>Perfect</b> and Randy Savage. Ramon and <b>Perfect</b> began the match, but Flair entered after <b>Perfect</b> insulted him. <b>Perfect</b> threw Flair into the corner, and Flair's momentum carried {{him over the}} top rope to the ring apron. Savage attacked Flair and then took Perfect's place in the ring to maintain the advantage over Flair. From outside the ring, Ramon hit Savage with his knee and Flair and Ramon took turns attacking Savage's knee. While Ramon performed a half Boston crab on Savage, <b>Perfect</b> considered leaving the match and abandoning Savage. Savage recovered briefly by trying to pin Flair, but Ramon performed a chokeslam on Savage. Ric Flair attempted to attack Savage from the top rope, but Savage threw him to the ring floor instead. <b>Perfect</b> executed a neckbreaker and an atomic drop on Ramon. Outside of the ring, Flair attacked Savage with a chair. The referee was knocked unconscious, and <b>Perfect</b> tried to pin Ramon by performing a PerfectPlex. Because no referee was available to count the pinfall, a substitute referee came to the ring. The first referee recovered as <b>Perfect</b> attempted to pin Flair with a PerfectPlex. Flair escaped the pin attempt, and he and Ramon attacked <b>Perfect</b> until the referees were unable to keep the match under control. As a result, Ramon and Flair were disqualified, and the victory was awarded to <b>Perfect</b> and Savage.|$|E
5|$|It was the 21st <b>perfect</b> game in MLB {{history and}} the first since Roy Halladay's <b>perfect</b> game on May 29, 2010.

Male and female <b>Perfects</b> always travelled with partners {{of the same sex}} to avoid sexual temptation. To their enemies this drew accusations of homosexuality. On their travels <b>Perfects</b> administered to the Credentes (Believers), the rank and file of Catharism who were not expected to follow the austere lifestyle of the <b>Perfects.</b> They were healers and worked with the sick, sometimes with medicinal remedies, sometimes with laying on of hands. Following the instructions described in the Bible, they walked from place to place and stayed in the houses of Credentes. Services and sacraments were held in people's homes or in places such as fields, forests or caves.|$|R
5|$|Lex Luger was {{accompanied}} {{to the ring}} by four women with revealing outfits {{as he prepared to}} face Mr. <b>Perfect.</b> The match began with technical wrestling, and <b>Perfect</b> tried to injure Luger's knee while Luger worked on Perfect's back. <b>Perfect</b> took control of the match with a powerslam and tried to pin Luger after performing a dropkick from the top rope. Luger's foot was on the ropes, however, so the referee halted the three-count and continued the match. Luger gained momentum and pinned Perfect; Perfect's feet were on the rope, but the referee did not see them. Luger continued to attack <b>Perfect</b> after the match and hit him with his forearm, which contains a steel plate {{as the result of a}} legitimate motorcycle accident. When <b>Perfect</b> got up, he chased Luger but was attacked by Shawn Michaels backstage.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Hughes {{used his}} {{strength}} advantage {{to control the}} early stages of the following match against Mr. <b>Perfect.</b> After he missed a leg drop, <b>Perfect</b> used the opportunity to perform a neckbreaker on Hughes.
