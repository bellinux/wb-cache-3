40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to {{study the effects of}} flux deposition non uniformity on spreading of molten metal. Flux deposition non-uniformity here means as to whether the amount of flux deposited in a non-uniform or uniform pattern helps in the better wetting and spreading characteristics of the molten metal or is detrimental to the process. The material selection constraint to the study was imposed by selecting brazing of aluminum i. e., aluminum alloy melting and flow over an aluminum alloy substrate. The study was carried out by conducting a number of Hot Stage microscopy tests using aluminum silicon alloy as the filler metal and <b>Potassium</b> Fluoro <b>Aluminate</b> (Nocolok®) as the flux. The flux was applied in different spatial distribution patterns to uncover the varying effects of its distribution on spreading. The uneven pattern of flux deposition indicates the influence on spreading but due to the efficient spreading of flux prior to aluminum melting and associated fuzziness of the achieved coverage distribution the effects are not always conclusive. It has been concluded that non uniform flux deposition does not necessarily mean uneven or less uniform spreading of the molten liquid metal if the spreading of the molten flux is beyond the distance of ultimate meta...|$|R

The precipitation boundaries, -log aAl(OH) 4 −/aOH−, of the amorphous phase (− 1. 9) and pseudoboehmite (− 1. 2) evaluated by interpretations of relaxation time curves are temperature insensitive.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{experimental work}} on thin films of different compounds containing lithium, sodium or potassium has been synthesized by {{atomic layer deposition}} (ALD). The overall motivation for this work has been to develop materials and methods to improve lithium ion battery technology by using ALD. A cathode in a lithium ion battery should have a long operating life, be environmentally benign and have high capacity and power density. Vanadium oxides are popular as cathodes in lithium ion batteries due to their relative low price and potentially high capacity. Most studies of vanadium oxide cathodes shows relatively short lifetime of the cathode or relatively fast cathodes. In this work a high power thin film cathode of V 2 O 5 for lithium ion batteries has been developed. The cathode is deposited by ALD using VO(thd) 2 and ozone, which displays a rather peculiar type of ALD-growth. This peculiar growth is studied in detail, and the optical properties of these films are investigated. The films have an unusually rough surface, and {{it was found that}} a 10 nm thick film deposited at 235 ºC consisted of individual nano particles. The 10 nm thick cathode has been shown to endure more than 4000 dischargecycles at 120 C and almost 1600 cycles while staying within 80 % of the original capacity. The same cathode was also shown to sustain discharge rates of 960 C which corresponds to a discharge in 3. 75 s. The power density obtained in this work bridges the gap between super capacitors and batteries and the combination of long lifetime and high discharge rate is not found previously for thin film batteries of V 2 O 5. ALD of lithium containing materials has attracted widespread interest the last few years. The number of known precursors for lithium has grown, but the complete picture is still not understood. Therefore lithium hexamethyldisilazane (LiHMDS) is explored as a precursor for ALD of lithium compounds. The precursor is shown successful in deposition of Li 3 N, Li 2 CO 3 and LiNbO 3. The deposition of Li 3 N may be an important step to deposit solid electrolytes and the deposition of Li 2 CO 3 proved to be important for proving the growth of oxides using this precursor. When comparing the growth of Li 3 N and Li 2 CO 3 it was found significant difference in the surface chemistry. The LiNbO 3 -films were shown to be ferroelectric with an unusually high coercive field. It proved possible to deposit epitaxial LiNbO 3 on single crystal substrates of LaAlO 3 and Al 2 O 3 and the orientation of the films could be controlled by the orientation of the substrate. A milestone in atomic layer deposition of lithium compounds would be to deposit a full battery. In order to realize this, a lithiated cathode material must be deposited. The cathode material LiMn 2 O 4 was also studied in this work. It was discovered that the amount of lithium in the deposited films is more or less independent of the number lithium cycles to manganese cycles. It is hypothesized that the ligand of the lithium precursor reduces the manganese and the lithium is intercalated into the manganese oxide. This is a new approach to ALD of lithium compounds and the term film body controlled lithium deposition is used to describe the mechanism. The use of LiHMDS is also attempted in deposition of LiMn 2 O 4, with no success. Sodium and potassium are among the few elements in the periodic table which are not yet used in ALD. Sodium and potassium are relatively similar to lithium and exploring the deposition of these elements will hopefully shed new light on the deposition of lithium compounds. Many oxides of sodium and potassium also have piezo- and ferroelectric properties, and the sodium ion battery is predicted to be a way to combat lithium shortage. Atomic layer deposition of sodium and potassium oxides is reported {{for the first time in}} this thesis. Six different precursors are investigated and evaluated and precursors for sodium and potassium. The initial study was performed by depositing sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>aluminates,</b> in order to evaluate the precursors. The process for the aluminates was found to scale up to the 200 mm wafer scale. The precursors were found to work in a large temperature window and react with both water and ozone, thus proving to relatively flexible and possible to combine with most known ALD-processes.

40|$|In {{this work}} a clay {{sediment}} from a reservoir was employed for {{the synthesis of}} geopolymers. The sediment was calcined at 650 and 750 °C for 1 h to ensure the conversion of aluminium coordination from octahedral to tetrahedral. The sediment was characterized by means of X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, mercury intrusion porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy. After calcination, the sediment was submitted to X-ray diffraction, mercury intrusion porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy. Strongly alkaline sodium and <b>potassium</b> <b>aluminate</b> solutions were used to start the polycondensation reaction responsible for geopolymer formation. The initial alkali metal hydroxide concentrations of these solutions were 17, 15 (only Na), 13, 11 and 8. 5 M. Polycondensation was carried out at 60 °C for times ranging from 15 min to 28 d. The geopolymer products obtained in all the experimental conditions tested were submitted to the quantitative determination {{of the extent of}} polycondensation through mass increase and loss on ignition, as well as to qualitative characterization by means of FT-IR spectroscopy. A reduced set of samples activated with solutions corresponding to initial [NaOH] 13 M and [KOH] 11 M and cured at 60 °C for 3 and 14 d were used for the determination of apparent density and unconfined compressive strength. These samples were also characterized by means of mercury intrusion porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy. The results have indicated that the development of preformed building materials starting from reservoir sediment, although requiring accurate mix design, can be possible by means of alkali metal aluminate activation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} {{atomic layer deposition}} (ALD) of {{thin films}} {{of a set of}} alkali metal niobates and tantalates with technologically important physical properties. ALD of LiNbO 3 is presented first, where we showcase the possibility of epitaxial integration of complex oxide thin films containing alkali metals. LiNbO 3 is a high performance ferroelectric, and these properties are studied to show that ALD can be utilized to obtain highly oriented films with piezo- and ferroelectric activity. The thesis continues with investigating the feasibility of growing sodium- and potassium containing materials with ALD. Prior to the work leading to this thesis, no reports of Na/K-deposition by ALD have been available. Several precursors are screened for self-limiting growth under typical ALD-conditions, and two optimal precursors are used to carry out deposition of sodium- and <b>potassium</b> <b>aluminate.</b> These precursors, both alkali metal t-butoxides, offer the possibility to grow sodium- and potassium containing materials, with water as the co-reactant, at temperatures between 250 and 300 °C. Using the results from general deposition of Na/K-containing materials and the experience from LiNbO 3 - deposition, four alkali metal niobates and tantalates; NaNbO 3, NaTaO 3, KNbO 3 and KTaO 3, were deposited. These materials have interesting intrinsic properties, such as ferroelectricity (KNbO 3) and photocatalytic activity (NaNbO 3). More technologically interesting, however, are the solid solutions KxNa 1 -xNbO 3 and KTaxNb 1 -xO 3, which are desirable for their strong ferroelectric and electrooptical responses, respectively. Proof-of-concept on the intermixing of these solid solutions by ALD is presented, displaying remarkable compositional control and reproducibility. KxNa 1 -xNbO 3 thin films are deposited for investigation of its electric properties, and piezoelectric activity is studied using piezoelectric force microscopy. The films are epitaxially integrated on a range of substrates, thereby controlling the orientation and direction of the polarity. Finally, some general notes on atomic layer deposition of alkali metal containing complex oxides are made, in light of what has been achieved in this work. Three main papers form the basis for this thesis. One on deposition of LiNbO 3, a second on Na/Kdeposition and a third on alkali metal niobate/tantalate-deposition...|$|E
