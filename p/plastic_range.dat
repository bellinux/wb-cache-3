5000|$|They exhibit plasticity—the {{ability to}} {{permanently}} change shape {{in response to}} the force, but remain in one piece. The yield strength is the point at which elastic deformation gives way to plastic deformation. Deformation in the <b>plastic</b> <b>range</b> is non-linear, and is described by the stress-strain curve. This response produces the observed properties of scratch and indentation hardness, as described and measured in materials science. Some materials exhibit both elasticity and viscosity when undergoing plastic deformation; this is called viscoelasticity.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{deformation}} is irreversible. However, {{an object}} in the <b>plastic</b> deformation <b>range</b> will first have undergone elastic deformation, which is reversible, so the object will return part way to its original shape. Soft thermoplastics have a rather large <b>plastic</b> deformation <b>range</b> as do ductile metals such as copper, silver, and gold. Steel does, too, but not cast iron. Hard thermosetting plastics, rubber, crystals, and ceramics have minimal <b>plastic</b> deformation <b>ranges.</b> An example of a material with a large <b>plastic</b> deformation <b>range</b> is wet chewing gum, which can be stretched dozens of times its original length.|$|R

The movable dislocation density was estimated from the <b>plastic</b> strain <b>range</b> and was expressed {{as a function of}} the number of stress cycles n by the following equations using a model based on the multiplication and annihilation process of dislocations.

50|$|Note {{that the}} {{deflections}} necessary {{to develop the}} stresses indicated in a plastic analysis are generally excessive, frequently {{to the point of}} incompatibility with the function of the structure. Therefore, separate analysis may be required to ensure design deflection limits are not exceeded. Also, since working materials into the <b>plastic</b> <b>range</b> can lead to permanent deformation of the structure, additional analyses may be required at limit load to ensure no detrimental permanent deformations occur. The large deflections and stiffness changes usually associated with plastic bending can significantly change the internal load distribution, particularly in statically indeterminate beams. The internal load distribution associated with the deformed shape and stiffness should be used for calculations.|$|E
5000|$|Alloys {{with larger}} span of solidus/liquidus {{temperatures}} tend to melt through a [...] "mushy" [...] state, {{during which the}} alloy {{is a mixture of}} solid and liquid material. Some alloys show tendency to liquation, separation of the liquid from the solid portion; for these the heating through the melting range must be sufficiently fast to avoid this effect. Some alloys show extended <b>plastic</b> <b>range,</b> when {{only a small portion of}} the alloy is liquid and most of the material melts at the upper temperature range; these are suitable for bridging large gaps and for forming fillets. Highly fluid alloys are suitable for penetrating deep into narrow gaps and for brazing tight joints with narrow tolerances but are not suitable for filling larger gaps. Alloys with wider melting range are less sensitive to non-uniform clearances.|$|E
5000|$|Ductility {{is defined}} as ‘‘an {{extent to which a}} {{material}} can sustain plastic deformation without rupture.’’ It is not only required in the forming process but is also needed for plastic redistribution of stress in members and connections, where stress concentration would occur. The ductility criteria and performance of low-ductility steels for cold-formed members and connections have been studied by Dhalla, Winter, and Errera at Cornell University. It was found that the ductility measurement in a standard tension test includes local ductility and uniform ductility. Local ductility is designated as the localized elongation at the eventual fracture zone. Uniform ductility is the ability of a tension coupon to undergo sizeable plastic deformations along its entire length prior to necking. This study also revealed that for the different ductility steels investigated, the elongation in 2-in. (50.8-mm) gage length did not correlate satisfactorily with either the local or the uniform ductility of the material.

The bulk water-treatment residue material could be easily remoulded at water contents below the measured Casagrande plastic limit, indicating that the reported <b>plastic</b> <b>range</b> was notional and, furthermore, that the use of liquidity index as an indicator of the material?s consistency is unreliable.

40|$|In {{the simple}} plastic theory {{commonly}} used for mild steel {{it is assumed}} that after yielding has occurred in either tension or compression, straining can continue indefinitely at constant stress. Such au assumption has been found satisfactory for low carbon steels having a <b>plastic</b> <b>range</b> corresponding to eight to ten times the strain a t yield, but for steels of greater strength th is range is often considerably shorter, and it becomes necessary {{to take into account the}} strain-hardening range beyond. To obtain experimental data, four steels were selected, varying in carbon content from 0. 28 to 0. 89 per cent, and having widely different stress-strain relations. For each steel a number of simply supported beams of square section were subjected to a symmetrical two-point loading; tension specimens were prepared from the unyielded ends of these beams and tested in a spring-loaded autographic testing machine to determine upper and lower yield stresses. In addition, two tension specimens from each steel were tested in a lever type of machine, and the strt%ss-strain relations through the <b>plastic</b> <b>range</b> and the initial stages of the strain-hardening range were obtained with the aid of a “Gerard ” extensometer.
