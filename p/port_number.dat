25|$|DNS {{primarily}} {{uses the}} User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on <b>port</b> <b>number</b> 53 to serve requests. DNS queries {{consist of a}} single UDP request from the client followed by a single UDP reply from the server. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used when the response data size exceeds 512 bytes, or for tasks such as zone transfers. Some resolver implementations use TCP for all queries.|$|E
25|$|TFTP is {{a simple}} {{protocol}} for transferring files, implemented {{on top of the}} UDP/IP protocols using well-known <b>port</b> <b>number</b> 69. TFTP was designed to be small and easy to implement, and therefore it lacks most of the advanced features offered by more robust file transfer protocols. TFTP only reads and writes files from or to a remote server. It cannot list, delete, or rename files or directories and it has no provisions for user authentication.|$|E
30|$|Most current Internet {{applications}} {{are based on}} TCP or UDP. Traditionally, network applications use fixed <b>port</b> <b>numbers</b> assigned by IANA [1]. Accordingly, TCP and UDP <b>port</b> <b>numbers</b> are directly associated to the types of various network application, e.g. TCP/ 80 for HTTP etc. TCP and UDP ports identified with 16 -bit numbers can be partitioned into three types: (1) Well-known Ports, which are <b>port</b> <b>numbers</b> between 0 to 1023, and closely bound to system specific services and protocols; (2) Registered Ports, which are <b>port</b> <b>numbers</b> between 1024 to 49151, and used by processes of procedures and executed programs of common users; and (3) Private Ports, which are <b>port</b> <b>numbers</b> between 49152 to 65535, and dynamically or temporarily used by client communication processes or executed programs.|$|R

50|$|To use remote port forwarding, {{the address}} of the {{destination}} server (on the tunnel's client side) and two <b>port</b> <b>numbers</b> must be known. The <b>port</b> <b>numbers</b> chosen depend on which application is to be used.|$|R
25|$|Since {{applications}} {{can communicate}} either {{with or without}} TLS (or SSL), {{it is necessary for}} the client to indicate to the server the setup of a TLS connection. One of the main ways of achieving this is to use a different <b>port</b> <b>number</b> for TLS connections, for example port 443 for HTTPS. Another mechanism is for the client to make a protocol-specific request to the server to switch the connection to TLS; for example, by making a STARTTLS request when using the mail and news protocols.|$|E
25|$|The {{protocol}} {{is usually}} {{described in terms}} of a client-server model, but can as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers consider the other to be a potential time source. Implementations send and receive timestamps using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on <b>port</b> <b>number</b> 123. They can also use broadcasting or multicasting, where clients passively listen to time updates after an initial round-trip calibrating exchange. NTP supplies a warning of any impending leap second adjustment, but no information about local time zones or daylight saving time is transmitted.|$|E
25|$|Client/server {{networking}} {{allows a}} program on a computer, called a client, to connect via a network to another computer, called a server. Servers offer (or host) various services to other network computers and users. These services are usually provided through ports or numbered access points beyond the server's IP address. Each <b>port</b> <b>number</b> is usually associated with a maximum of one running program, {{which is responsible for}} handling requests to that port. A daemon, being a user program, can in turn access the local hardware resources of that computer by passing requests to the operating system kernel.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} periodic graph exploration in which a mobile entity with constant memory, an agent, has to visit all n nodes of an input simple, connected, undirected graph in a periodic manner. Graphs {{are assumed to be}} anonymous, that is, nodes are unlabeled. While visiting a node, the agent may distinguish between the edges incident to it; for each node v, the endpoints of the edges incident to v are uniquely identified by different integer labels called <b>port</b> <b>numbers.</b> We are interested in algorithms for assigning the <b>port</b> <b>numbers</b> together with traversal algorithms for agents using these <b>port</b> <b>numbers</b> to obtain short traversal periods. Periodic graph exploration is unsolvable if the <b>port</b> <b>numbers</b> are set arbitrarily, see [1]. However, surprisingly small periods can be achieved by carefully assigning the <b>port</b> <b>numbers.</b> Dobrev et al. [4] described an algorithm for assigning <b>port</b> <b>numbers</b> and an oblivious agent (i. e., an agent with no memory) using it, such that the agent explores any graph with n nodes within the period 10 n.

25|$|Besides air transport, Tenerife has two {{principal}} maritime ports: the Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Puerto de Santa Cruz), which serves the various capitals of the Canary Islands, {{especially those in}} the west; and the Port of Los Cristianos (Puerto de Los Cristianos), which serves the various island capitals of the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The first port also has passenger services, which connect with the mainland port of Cádiz (and vice versa). There are plans to build a new port in the south of the island, in Granadilla de Abona, and in another in the west, at Fonsalía. The Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the first fishing port in the Canary Islands with approximately 7,500 tons of fish caught, according to the Statistical Yearbook of the State Ports 2006 (the latest of which is changing).
