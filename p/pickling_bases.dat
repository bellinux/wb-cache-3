About this time the name rassolnik was attached to it, originating from the Russian word rassol which means [...] "brine" [...] (pickle water). Pickle water {{was known to be}} used as base for soups from the 15th century at the latest. Its concentration and ratio with other liquids and soup components gave birth to different soups: solyanka, shchi, and of course rassolnik. The latest are moderately sour-salty soups on <b>pickled</b> cucumber <b>base.</b> Some are vegetarian, but more often with products like veal or beef kidneys or all poultry giblets (stomach, liver, heart, neck, feet). For best taste {{there has to be a}} balance between the sour part and neutral absorbers (cereals, potatoes, root vegetables).|$|R

40|$|AbstractLatex {{coagulant}} is one {{of important}} factors on natural rubber processing because it will determine the quality of rubber end products. One of the coagulants that produce good quality natural rubber is liquid smoke. The use of liquid smoke as coagulant is thought to cause corrosion in processing equipment commonly made of iron or steel. The objectives {{of this study were}} to identify and to study the characteristic of iron metal corrosion in the solution of liquid smoke coagulant. The treatment of liquid smoke as corrosion media consisted of 100 % pure liquid smoke (AC 100), 10 % pure liquid smoke (AC 10), 100 % liquid smoke formula (FA 100) and 10 % liquid smoke formula (FA 10). The method used was weight loss method with the planned interval test. The removal of corrosion products on the metal specimen was done by <b>pickling</b> method <b>based</b> on ASTM G 1 - 81. The results showed that corrosion rate of the liquid smoke and its formula was around 0. 05 - 0. 23 mm per years. Corrosion resistance of iron metal in liquid smoke coagulant was categorized as good level. This analysis indicated that liquid smoke coagulant and its formula has very low corrosivity level. The visualization with 10 x magnification showed that the corrosion attack was clearly visible on the iron metal surface...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Seizure {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{pediatric}} neurology problems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects of different kinds of food on seizures of epileptic children based on their mothers attitude and experience. Methods: In a descriptive- analytic study done at the pediatric neurology clinic of Shahid Sadoughi University, attitude and experience of mothers regarding the effect of different kinds of foods on children seizures was evaluated via a questionnaire. Results: A total of 148 mothers with ages ranging between 17 - 52 years (mean± SD: 31. 6 ± 6. 6 years) were evaluated. Their children were 58. 5 % boys and 41. 5 % girls with age range of 1 - 19 years (mean± SD: 6. 2 ± 3. 8 years). Eighty percent of mothers believed that different kinds of food affected the seizures and this belief was not related to their educational level, gender of child or state of seizure control. The most common kinds of food which triggered seizures based on mothers attitude were salty food and <b>pickled</b> vegetables and <b>based</b> on experience, they were cucumber and milk and. The most common kinds of food that caused decreasing in seizures frequency based on mothers attitude were coffee and cattle oil and based on experience, they were honey and sugar. Conclusion: In this study, majority of mothers believe that different kinds of food have an effect on the seizures in their children and it is necessary to educate epileptic patients about their diet after extraction and testing of effective materials of different kinds of food in animals and human models via further researches...|$|R
