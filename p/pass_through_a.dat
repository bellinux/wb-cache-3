South {{of the community}} of Kemptville, the Prescott Highway crosses the route a third time, with an interchange connecting the two highways.|$|E
5|$|Like all ants, banded sugar ants begin life as eggs. If the egg is fertilised, the ant {{becomes a}} female; if not, {{it will become}} a male. They develop through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that they <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> larval and pupal stage before emerging as adults.|$|E
5|$|Compliance {{with the}} law is checked when {{vehicles}} <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> weigh station, often located at the borders between states or {{on the outskirts of}} major cities, where the vehicle may be weighed and measured. The one exception to the formula allows a standard five-axle semi-truck configuration to weigh the maximum legal gross weight. This exception was specifically requested by the American Trucking Associations to allow tank trucks to reach the maximum legal gross weight without violating the bridge formula law.|$|E

Use in conjunction with war or spiritual books can boost respective health significantly. <b>Passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> tan gate changes nothing.|$|R
5|$|Homer and Marge, on the {{way back}} from an {{orchestra}} performance, <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> seedy part of town. Marge cautions Homer, but gets enticed by Snake's Three-card Monte game. Snake cheats Homer out of $20, but Marge exposes the con and Snake takes off. After giving chase, Marge knocks Snake unconscious with a garbage can lid, giving her a sense of exhilaration. Finding her everyday routine dull and boring, she decides to join the Springfield police force, despite Homer's concerns.|$|E
5|$|Inside the LBC, {{visitors}} <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} exhibits about the bell {{before reaching the}} Liberty Bell itself. Due to security concerns following {{an attack on the}} bell by a visitor with a hammer in 2001, the bell is hung out of easy reach of visitors, who are no longer allowed to touch it, and all visitors undergo a security screening.|$|E
5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.|$|E
50|$|Exhaust {{gas from}} each gas turbine <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> {{individual}} CMI {{heat recovery steam generator}} (HRSG). For Phase 1 the steam <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> ABB steam turbine connected to an ABB 50WT hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator. For Phase 2 the steam <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> ABB steam turbine connected to an ABB WY21 TEWAC (air-water-cooled) turbogenerator. The Phase 1 generator {{is larger than}} Phase 2 so needs to be cooled by hydrogen gas.|$|R
5000|$|... e < 0: A COR {{less than}} zero would {{represent}} a collision in which the separation velocity of the objects has the same direction (sign) as the closing velocity, implying the objects <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> one another without fully engaging. This may also {{be thought of as}} an incomplete transfer of momentum. An example of this might be a small, dense object <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> large, less dense one - e.g., <b>a</b> bullet <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> target, or <b>a</b> motorcycle <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> motor home or <b>a</b> wave tearing <b>through</b> <b>a</b> dam.|$|R

5|$|Eurostar {{passengers}} travelling {{inside the}} Schengen Area (Brussels-Lille or Brussels-Calais; Lille-Calais trips are not allowed) <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> separate corridor in Brussels bypassing border checks, and enter carriage 18 of the train, which {{is reserved for}} these passengers. This arrangement was set up after numerous illegal immigrants entered the UK without {{the right to do}} so, by buying a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais but remaining on the train until London – an issue exacerbated by Belgian police threatening to arrest UK Border Agency staff at Brussels-Midi if they tried to prevent passengers whom they suspected of attempting to exploit this loophole from boarding Eurostar trains.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Physicist Richard A. Muller {{postulated}} that the Sun has a heretofore undetected companion, either a brown dwarf or a red dwarf, in an elliptical orbit within the Oort cloud. This object, known as Nemesis, was hypothesized to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> {{portion of the}} Oort cloud approximately every 26million years, bombarding the inner Solar System with comets. However, to date no evidence of Nemesis or the Oort cloud have been found, and many lines of evidence (such as crater counts), have thrown their existence into doubt. Recent scientific analysis no longer supports the idea that extinctions on Earth happen at regular, repeating intervals. Thus, the Nemesis hypothesis is no longer needed to explain current assumptions.|$|E
5|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Bart exit the Magic Palace's gift shop, only {{to end up in}} another gift shop. The scene was based on an {{experience}} of the episode's show runner Mike Scully, who, in order to exit the Lance Burton Theatre after a magic show, had to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> gift shop. The ending scene of the episode went through several changes and was as a result completed late in the episode's production. The writers had conceived the courtroom scene, but they were stuck {{trying to come up with}} an ending after Skinner had been shot. They eventually decided that the trial was a scam staged by the townspeople, and Simpsons writer George Meyer pitched the surfing scene that closed the episode.|$|E
50|$|From US 31, SR 18 heads east towards Converse <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> {{concurrency}} with State Road 19. SR 18 then heads through Converse, after Converse SR 18 has a concurrency with State Road 13. SR 18 turns southeast towards Marion <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> Sweetser. In Marion eastbound SR 18 is on a Fourth Street and westbound SR 18 is on Third Street and Second Street. East of Marion {{the one-way}} streets become a four-lane highway. SR 18 heads east towards Montpelier <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> interchange with I-69 and <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> intersection with State Road 5 and State Road 3. East of Montpelier SR 18 <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> intersection with State Road 1. Then SR 18 heads east towards its eastern terminus near Bryant at an intersection with US 27 and SR 67, from this intersection SR 67 heads east towards Ohio.|$|R

50|$|Static timing {{analysis}} tries {{to figure out}} the best and worst case time estimate for each signal as they <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> electronic device. Whenever <b>a</b> signal <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> node, a bit of uncertainty must be added to the time required for the signal to transit that device. These uncertain delays add up so, after <b>passing</b> <b>through</b> many devices, the worst-case timing for a signal could be unreasonably pessimistic.|$|R
5|$|In organisms, NAD can be {{synthesized}} {{from simple}} building-blocks (de novo) from the amino acids tryptophan or aspartic acid. In an alternative fashion, more complex {{components of the}} coenzymes are taken up from food as the vitamin called niacin. Similar compounds are released by reactions that break down the structure of NAD. These preformed components then <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> salvage pathway that recycles {{them back into the}} active form. Some NAD is also converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP); the chemistry of this related coenzyme {{is similar to that of}} NAD, but it has different roles in metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Like every ant, {{the life}} of a jack jumper ant starts from an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the ant will be a female (diploid); if not, it will become a male (haploid). They develop through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that they <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> larva and pupa stage before emerging as an adult. Cocoons that are isolated from the colony are able to shed their pupal skin before hatching, allowing themselves to advance to full pigmentation. Newborns can also eclose (emerge from their pupa stage) without assistance from other ants. Once born, jack jumper ants can identify distinct tasks, an obvious primitive trait Myrmecia ants are known for.|$|E
5|$|The Mecoptera {{are closely}} related to the Siphonaptera (fleas), and a little more distantly to the Diptera (true flies). They are {{somewhat}} fly-like in appearance, being small to medium-sized insects with long slender bodies and narrow membranous wings. Most breed in moist environments such as leaf litter or moss, and the eggs may not hatch until the wet season arrives. The larvae are caterpillar-like and mostly feed on vegetable matter, and the non-feeding pupae may <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> diapause until favourable weather conditions occur.|$|E

5|$|The intergiro {{classification}} {{was marked}} by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro {{is similar to that}} of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.|$|E
5|$|In Dearborn, US12 intersects US24 (Telegraph Road) at an {{interchange}} on {{the western}} side of the city, and M-39 (Southfield Freeway) on the eastern side near the River Rouge crossing and Greenfield Village. On the Dearborn–Detroit city border, US12 <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> complex interchange with I-94 (Edsel Ford Freeway) and M-153 (Ford Road/Wyoming Avenue). Michigan Avenue continues northeasterly parallel to I-94 for a short distance before it turns due east. Once it makes the direction change, it forms the 0 Mile of Detroit's Mile Road System. US12 continues through residential areas on Detroit's West Side, passing through the interchange that connects I-75 with I-96's eastern terminus near the Ambassador Bridge. The highway runs through Corktown, Detroit and beside the site of the former Tiger Stadium at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull. East of the former stadium, US12 crosses M-10 (Lodge Freeway) near the MGM Grand Detroit casino. East of M-10, Michigan Avenue enters Downtown Detroit. At the corner of Michigan and Cass, US12 ends while Michigan Avenue continues several blocks further to terminate at Campus Martius Park at Woodward Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Ophelia {{rushes to}} her father, {{telling him that}} Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and {{behaving}} crazily. Polonius blames love for Hamlet's madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. As he enters to do so, {{the king and queen}} finish welcoming Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the students investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood and behavior. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the King of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against Poland, though they will <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> portion of Denmark to get there.|$|E

50|$|Turbidimetry (the name being {{derived from}} turbidity) {{is the process}} of {{measuring}} the loss of intensity of transmitted light due to the scattering effect of particles suspended in it. Light is <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> filter creating a light of known wavelength which is then <b>passed</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> cuvette containing a solution. A photoelectric cell collects the light which <b>passes</b> <b>through</b> the cuvette. <b>A</b> measurement is then given for the amount of absorbed light.|$|R

5|$|The Selle Français stud {{book has}} long allowed {{crossbreeding}} {{with four other}} breeds: the Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter. Today, restrictions exist to harmonize the stud book with directives for other European warmblood breeds. For a Selle Français to be registered, it must be from two registered Selle Français parents or from {{a cross between a}} Selle Français and a facteur de selle français (non-Selle Français horse that has passed stud book selection procedures). Stallions must <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> selection process before their progeny is allowed to be registered as Selle Français. The process involves an approval committee that judges stallions on criteria based on the age, breed and nationality of the horses. The qualification criteria involve the conformation, gaits, performance and are scored against national indices.|$|E
5|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope is {{a device}} for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows particles to <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on {{each of which is}} an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the Fermi level local density of states.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the current}} rules, players must have at least 10 years of major league {{experience}} {{to be eligible for}} induction. In addition, they must be retired {{for at least five years}} if living, or deceased for at least six months. Players meeting these qualifications must <b>pass</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> screening committee, and are then voted on by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Each writer may vote for up to 10 players; to be admitted into the Hall of Fame, a player must be approved by 75% of those casting ballots. Players receiving less than 5% approval are removed from future BBWAA ballots. The rules, as revised in July 2016, allow that all individuals eligible for induction but not for the BBWAA ballot—players who have not been approved by the BBWAA election process within 15 years of their retirement, umpires, managers, pioneers, and executives—may be considered by one of four voting bodies that have taken over the role of the former Veterans Committee, based on the era in which each individual candidate made his greatest contribution to the sport. On a few occasions, exceptions have been made to the guidelines in place at the time: Lou Gehrig was elected in 1939 following his diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Roberto Clemente was elected shortly after his death in 1972; and Addie Joss was elected in 1978 even though he completed only nine seasons before his death.|$|E
