40|$|Historically, the {{elective}} intraoperative ventilatory flow {{in small}} infants has been <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow</b> (DF) [1, 2]. This {{was due to}} because the traditional thinking that a <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow</b> waveform (inherent to pressure control ventilation, PCV) improves oxygenation compared with the square flow waveform (common in volume control ventilation, VCV) related to a better intrapulmonary gas distribution. However, the superiority of <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow</b> compared with square flow {{has not yet been}} demonstrated during ventilation in small infants. Even in adults, the su-periority has been questioned in clinical studies showing contradictory results [3 - 10].

30|$|All the {{above-mentioned}} literature about MHD nanofluids flowing past a wedge only considered the accelerating or constant flow case, with positive or constant pressure gradient. In both cases, there exists no separation {{point in the}} velocity profile. However, many early researchers [20 – 23] pointed out that for the <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow</b> case, with negative pressure gradient, two solutions occurred in the well-known Falkner-Skan equation. Hence separation may happen in the <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow.</b> As the results {{pointed out in the}} reference [24], the occurrence of flow separation has several undesirable effects, and it leads to an increase in the drag on a body immersed in the flow. In order to reduce the drag force, injection on the boundary layer flow has been introduced and proved to be an effective way [25].|$|R

The term ρū, similar to the Reynolds stress, should not be neglected in the momentum equation, therefore. Theoretical and experimental studies evidence the existence of an upward velocity component in <b>decelerating</b> <b>flows.</b> It was confirmed that the classical log-law is applicable if and only if the wall-normal velocity is zero, and the wake-function is caused by an up-flow.

The results of the accelerated flow show that there are two patterns in the formation of a sectional velocity profile and transition, one of which is observed when the acceleration is relatively large compared with the propagation of viscous effects, and the other when the acceleration is comparatively small. A friction coefficient of an accelerated flow tends to be larger than that of a quasi-steady flow in the laminar region, while it has reverse tendency in the turbulent region. For a <b>decelerated</b> <b>flow</b> a turbulent region is maintained almost all over the deceleration periods, and the friction coefficient becomes larger than that of a quasi-steady flow...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{numerical}} analysis of steady, laminar and 2 -D nanofluid flow around a circular cylinder {{has been carried}} out to showcase the effects of variable viscosity on flow characteristics. The governing equations of flow are solved using a finite-volume method based on SIMPLE algorithm. Three cases of simulations in which the effective viscosity of the nanofluid is calculated using (a) Classical Brinkman model, (b) Recent correlation from literature and (c) Experimental data from literature are performed. A comparative analysis of the three cases shows that the flow characteristics of nanofluids become unpredictable due to the uncertainties in effective viscosity. In the first case, nanofluids show an accelerated flow with earlier flow separation and longer wake bubbles. Whereas, in other two cases, a <b>decelerated</b> <b>flow</b> with delayed flow separation is noted. This is the first time; a <b>decelerated</b> <b>flow</b> of nanofluids has been reported in literature.

40|$|Sediment {{transport}} is a geophysical {{phenomenon that}} sediment particles are driven {{to move in}} streamwise and vertical directions by the corresponding forces. Almost all existing formulae of sediment transport were derived {{based on the assumption}} that sediment transport can be fully expressed by streamwise parameters like velocity or boundary shear stress etc., whilst the vertical parameters are not included, like the variation of water depth (pressure) over time and space, vertical velocity or seepage. This paper investigates the effect of vertical motion on sediment transport, it was found that the vertical motion can be well represented by a vertical velocity and the upward velocity increases particles 2 ̆ 7 mobility, and the downward motion increases its stability. <b>Decelerating</b> <b>flows</b> can promote the upward flow and vice versa, this is why severe erosion always occurs in <b>decelerating</b> <b>flows.</b> New equations were developed to express the influence of vertical motion on sediment transport, in which streamwise and vertical parameters are included.

40|$|Abstract. An {{experimental}} study on incipient motion of gravel-bed streams under steady-decelerating flow is presented. Experiments {{were carried out}} in a flume with two median grain sizes, d 50 = 16 · 7 mm for a fixed-bed case and d 50 = 8 mm for a mobile bed case. In addition, an effort is made to determine a simplified method for the estimation of bed shear stress in <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow</b> over fixed and mobile beds for use in field situations. From the observation of eleven fixed-bed and nine mobile-bed velocity profiles, it is revealed that the parabolic law method (PLM) and the Reynolds stress method are comparable for estimation of shear velocity in general. Also, {{the results show that}} the shear stress distribution adopts a convex form over fixed and mobile beds. Due to this form the critical Shields parameter value for <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow</b> is less than the reported values in literature.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model for deposition of non-uniform cohesive sediment {{at a point}} was applied to laboratory and field settings. The results were compared with those from a uniform sediment model applied to the same settings. In the non-uniform (distributed) model, classes of sediment (representing different floc sizes) each had a corresponding settling velocity and critical shear stress for deposition. The models were applied to laboratory deposition tests in an annular flume. Tests with steady and slowly <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow</b> were both modelled. The distributed sediment model was {{shown to be a}} much better model of deposition in <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow</b> in the closed system of the annular flume. The model was shown {{to be sensitive to the}} settling velocity of the class corresponding to the largest flocs. The importance of more accurate methods of determining floc size and settling velocity distributions was recognised. Both models were also applied to field measurements of deposition during a tide made in the Mersey Estuary. Both models gave a reasonable fit to the data, but the distributed sediment model did not significantly improve the uniform sediment model for field use. External influences and advection of sediment from outside the immediate area were shown to affect the field measurements...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{not well}} {{understood}} how different ventilation modes affect the regional distribution of ventilation, particularly within the injured lung. OBJECTIVES: We compared respiratory mechanics, lung aeration and regional specific ventilation ((Equation is included in full-text article.)) distributions in healthy and surfactant-depleted rabbits ventilated with pressure-regulated volume control (PRVC) mode with a <b>decelerating</b> inspiratory <b>flow</b> or with volume control (VC) mode. DESIGN: Randomised experimental study. ANIMALS AND INTERVENTIONS: New Zealand white rabbits (n = 8) were anaesthetised, paralysed and mechanically ventilated either with VC or PRVC mode (tidal volume: 7 ml kg; rate: 40 min; positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) : 3 cmH 2 O), at baseline and after lung injury induced by lung lavage. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Airway resistance (Raw), respiratory tissue damping (G) and elastance (H) were measured by low-frequency forced oscillations. Synchrotron radiation computed tomography during stable xenon wash-in {{was used to measure}} regional lung aeration and specific ventilation and the relative fraction of nonaerated, trapped, normally, poorly and hyperinflated lung regions. RESULTS: Lung lavage significantly elevated peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) (P < 0. 001). PIP was lower on PRVC compared with VC mode (- 12. 7 +/- 1. 7 %, P < 0. 001). No significant differences in respiratory mechanics, regional ventilation distribution, strain or blood oxygenation could be detected between the two ventilation modes. CONCLUSION: A <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow</b> pattern (PRVC) resulted in equivalent regional ventilation distribution, respiratory mechanics and gas exchange, in both normal and mechanically heterogeneous lungs with, however, a significantly lower peak pressure. Our data suggest that the lower PIP on PRVC ventilation was because of the <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow</b> pattern rather than the ventilation distribution...|$|R

40|$|In blunt {{traumatic}} aortic injury, it {{is highly}} debated whether an abrupt deceleration alone is sufficient to cause aortic rupture. Motivated by this debate, this fundamental study investigates {{the effects of a}} localized transverse impulsive body force acting on a straight circular pipe through numerical simulation for both constant and pulsatile inlet velocity profiles. Application of this impulsive force results in a transverse pressure gradient which skews counterclockwise with flow acceleration. This pressure gradient induces two counter-rotating streamwise vortices at the boundaries of the forced section with secondary flows developing in conjunction which act to restore the unforced velocity profile. The development of the secondary flow was observed to occur later for an accelerating flow and earlier for a <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow.</b> A dimensionless parameter, Ψ, was developed to characterize flows based on the ratio of transverse to streamwise pressure gradients. Lower Reynolds number flows (higher Ψ), were observed to be most readily affected by the body force. Maximum skewing of the velocity profile occurred during the impact rather than at the end except for a <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow,</b> with larger skewing occurring for higher Ψ.

The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to com-pare how two modes of positive pressure ventilation af-fect cardiac output, airway pressures, oxygenation, and carbon dioxide removal in children with congenital heart disease in the immediate postoperative period. The in-vestigation used a one group pretest–post-test study de-sign and was performed in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit in a university-affiliated children’s hospital. Nine infants were enrolled immediately after repair of tetralogy of Fallot (2) or atrioventricular septal defects (7) with mean weight 4 5. 5 kg (4. 2 – 7. 3 kg). Children were admitted to the pediatric cardiothoracic intensive care unit after complete surgical repair of their cardiac defect and stabilized on a Siemen’s Servo 300 ventilator in volume control mode (VCV 1) (volume-targeted ven-tilation with a square flow wave pattern). Tidal volume was set at 15 cc/kg (total). Hemodynamic parameters, airway pressures and ventilator settings, and an arterial blood gas were measured. Patients were then changed to pressure-regulated volume control mode (PRVC) (volume-targeted ventilation with <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow</b> wave pattern) with the tidal volume set as before.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Rapidly <b>decelerating</b> sediment-laden <b>flows</b> {{typically}} emplace confined sedimentary deposits. In the fluvial environment, when sediment-laden rivers reach lakes the <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow</b> emplaces a subaerial delta with distinctive topset, foreset, and bottomset deposits. In {{the submarine}} environment, turbidity currents undergoing rapid deceleration commonly emplace sedimentary wedges (i. e., deposits thinning in the downstream direction). Froude-supercritical turbidity currents have an intrinsic self-regulating mechanism for deceleration, {{in that the}} faster they flow, the more they incorporate ambient sea water through mixing at their interface. In addition, special topographic configurations, such as the entrance into a zone of much lower slope and/or lateral confinement, or the passage into a confined minibasin, may trigger sudden flow deceleration by forcing a transition to subcritical flow through an internal hydraulic jump. The present paper and its companion present experiments on a generic configuration aimed at studying the emplacement of wedge-shaped sedimentary deposits by continuous supercritical density currents. The deceleration is achieved both by natural entrainment of ambient water and {{by the presence of}} an obstructing barrier downstream.

40|$|DNS of a {{turbulent}} channel flow {{subjected to a}} step change in pressure gradient are performed to facilitate a direct comparison between ramp-up and ramp-down flows. Strong differences are found between behaviours of turbulence in the two flows. The wall shear stress in the ramp-up flow first overshoots, and then strongly undershoots the quasi-steady value in the initial stage of the excursion, before approaching the quasi-steady value. In a strongly <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow,</b> the wall shear stress tends to first undershoot but then overshoot the quasi-steady value. 'Slow' response of turbulence as well as flow inertia is responsible for these behaviours. In the ramp-up flow, the response of turbulence {{is similar to that}} observed in uniformly accelerating flows from previous studies, exhibiting a three-stage development. However, the transition between the various stages is more gradual and the responding stage is much longer and slower in the flows considered here. It has been shown that the delay in the near wall region is longer than that in the buffer layer confirming that turbulence response first occurs at the location of peak turbulence production. In a strongly <b>decelerating</b> <b>flow,</b> the response of turbulence exhibits a two-stage development. In both ramp-up and ramp down flows, the energy distribution in the three components of turbulent kinetic energy deviates from that of the steady flow. In a ramp-up flow, more energy is in upsilon(1) and less in u(2) and u(3,) whereas the trend is reversed in a ramp-down flow.
