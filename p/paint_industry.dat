Employees will be more satisfied if they get what they expected. When employees are treated fairly overall in the organization, they feel need of reciprocal response to the organization in positive behaviors. Organizational justice and psychological contracts are important factors that influence the satisfactions of the personal in an organization. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the relationship among organizational justice (Procedural, Distributional and Interactional), psychological contract and job satisfaction. This paper examines the effect of Job satisfaction on Organizational justice and explains the concept of psychological contract and presents the result of a survey of managers and officers from the <b>paints</b> <b>industry</b> of Pakistan.

40|$|Due {{to major}} {{problems}} {{generated in the}} <b>paint</b> <b>industries</b> by hazardous waste and its attendant effects, “Solvent Recovery and Analysis ” {{as a means of}} waste minimization was investigated. The inputs in paints production, the sources of waste, the types and properties of solvents used in <b>paint</b> <b>industries</b> were also reviewed. The recovery of waste samples obtained from washing different gloss paints off production pots using MIBK and Toluene as washing solvents were carried out on laboratory scale by a combined filtration and distillation processes. These methods were chosen because they are the most efficient and cost effective from various recovery techniques reviewed. The results obtained showed that an average of 71. 43 % of wastes was recovered as both recyclable and reusable solvent. This is about N 5, 550. 00 gain for every 200 litres filler washed after paint production. Analysis of the recovered solvent gave a sweet pungent odour and a light yellowish colour.

This study investigated the numerous information and communications technologies deployed for products marketing in the Nigerian <b>paints</b> <b>industry</b> and also examined the degree of capacity in which ICTs were deployed in relations to contemporary marketing practices. This study considerably administered 240 questionnaire on paints manufacturing and marketing firms in Nigeria which resulted to 84. 5 % response rate in year 2014. The outcomes of the analysis revealed that the telephone and e-mail were widely embraced for marketing in the Nigerian <b>paints</b> <b>industry.</b> It was also discovered that paints companies adopted ICT more in a reinforcing capability as against enhancing and transforming purposes. The study suggested that paints producing and marketing firms in Nigeria need to incorporate more of ICT facilities and utilize the various offers of electronic marketing for their daily operations and automations thereby improving firm’s profitability and performance. More importantly, attention should be shifted on companies’ capability to innovate and consequently introducing new ICT products and services in the market. </p...|$|R
40|$|Risk and {{its control}} are {{important}} themes in {{occupational health and safety}}. In the current regulatory framework, risk is conceptualised as a probabilistic expression of hazard potential. However, social meanings of {{risk in the}} workplace may be different. The social context of work shapes the ways that risk is understood in the workplace, yet little research in occupational health and safety acknowledges it. A few studies of risk have used qualitative research methods to elicit understandings of risk at work; however, little research explores the experiences of both employers and employees. This study describes the narratives of risk in occupational health and safety of employers and employees in the Victorian <b>painting</b> <b>industry.</b> Using ethnographic methods, we collected data about the contexts in which risk is experienced and the sources of risk that each group identifies. These narratives reveal that risk in the <b>painting</b> <b>industry</b> is constructed through the interactions of three factors: the social context, the hierarchical structure of the industry and the shared assumptions about risk control through individual skills and responsibilities. The narratives explain why occupational health and safety strategies focusing solely on individual behaviour change or technical measures will be unsuccessful...|$|R
