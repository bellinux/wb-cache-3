5|$|In {{common with}} the other Mesoamerican civilizations, the Maya used a base 20 (vigesimal) system. The bar-and-dot {{counting}} system that is the base of Maya numerals was in use in Mesoamerica by 1000 BC; the Maya adopted it by the Late Preclassic, and added the symbol for zero. This {{may have been the}} earliest known occurrence of the idea of an explicit zero worldwide, although it may have been predated by the Babylonian system. The earliest explicit use of zero occurred on monuments dated to 357 AD. In its earliest uses, the zero served as a <b>place</b> <b>holder,</b> indicating an absence of a particular calendrical count. This later developed into a numeral that was used to perform calculation, and was used in hieroglyphic texts for more than a thousand years, until its use was extinguished by the Spanish.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{source of}} the suanpan is Chinese counting rods, which operated with a decimal system but lacked the concept of zero as a <b>place</b> <b>holder.</b> The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the Tang dynasty (618–907) when travel in the Indian Ocean and the Middle East would have provided direct contact with India, allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the decimal point from Indian merchants and mathematicians.|$|E

25|$|LittleBigPlanets origin {{lies in a}} {{conversation}} between Media Molecule co-founders Mark Healey and Dave Smith after a cinema visit to see Howl's Moving Castle. Healey and Smith discussed a game that had character controls similar to their previous game, Rag Doll Kung Fu, that would be playable on a console. Healey and Smith left Lionhead Studios in December 2005 along with other Media Molecule co-founders Alex Evans and art director Kareem Ettouney, and managed to arrange a meeting with Phil Harrison, the then-head of development for SCE Worldwide Studios. They created a prototype of their idea, a game called Craftworld, a physics-based, 2D side-scrolling game, with a <b>place</b> <b>holder</b> character called Mr. Yellowhead. Mr. Yellowhead's arms were controllable with the right analogue stick of the PlayStation 2 controller that Media Molecule had connected to their PC, whilst his legs were controlled with the left stick. The object of the game was to guide Mr. Yellowhead past a number of obstacles by grabbing onto objects and pushing or rolling them around.|$|E

2500|$|Garner co-starred in two romantic comedies in 2009. She first {{appeared}} opposite Matthew McConaughey in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.

[...] Garner's second performance of 2009 was opposite comedian Ricky Gervais in his directorial debut The Invention of Lying. Gervais was keen to cast Garner – [...] "always happy and always pleasant to everyone" [...] – against type. David Edelstein of New York Magazine said she [...] "proves again (the first time was 13 Going on 30) what a dizzying comedienne she is. She looks as if the wheels in her head are not just turning but falling off and needing to be screwed back on." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised an [...] "inspired, seemingly effortless, performance" [...] while Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said she [...] "has never been better onscreen ... Garner gets to show a comic facility we haven't seen before."

[...] Scott Collura of IGN awarded the film 8.4/10, describing it as being:"terrific, a fun and exciting entry in the series that balances subtle fan service while also feeling fresh and modern; Star Trek Beyond is the perfect way to celebrate the series’ 50th anniversary." [...] David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said the screenplay by Simon Pegg and Doug Jung [...] "injects a welcome strain of humor that's true to the original Gene Roddenberry creation, delivering nostalgia without stiff veneration", and went on by saying, [...] "While Beyond won't unseat 1982's thrilling [...] as the gold standard for Star Trek movies, it's a highly entertaining entry guaranteed to give the franchise continuing life." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Variety, in an otherwise positive review, described the film being: [...] "a very familiar, old-fangled, no-mystery structure, and that’s because it’s basically the Star Trek version of an interplanetary action film, with a plot that doesn’t take you to many new frontiers." [...] Furthermore, he called Star Trek Beyond [...] "a somewhat diverting <b>place</b> <b>holder,</b> but one hopes that the next Star Trek movie will {{have what it takes to}} boldly go where no Star Trek movie has gone before."
