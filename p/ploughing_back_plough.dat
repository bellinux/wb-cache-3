The corporation also is bound by minimum dividend obligation irrespective, whether it makes profit or not out of the post tax and post dividend income.

In fact, is not exaggeration of the state that effective recovery of loans is the backboneof any financial institutions.|$|R

Data for this study were sourced through the administration of copies of questionnaire to six (6) out of eleven (11) intermediate cocoa processing firms in Southwestern zone of Nigeria that are registered with the Nigerian Export Promotion Council. The six (6) intermediate cocoa processing firms were purposively selected because they were those discovered to be functioning firms as at the time of field survey exercise. It was discovered that fund sourced from Commercial banks and <b>Ploughed</b> <b>back</b> profit had significant impact on Nigeria cocoa export performance while the impact of fund sourced from Development bank was insignificant. Thus, policy makers are strongly advised to henceforth route their intervention funds/assistance to any sector through the commercial banks for effectiveness but that interest rates charged by these banks should be closely monitored...|$|R

The Greeks did not use animal manure, possibly due to the low number of cattle. The only soil additive was weeds <b>ploughed</b> <b>back</b> into the ground after fields came out of fallow.|$|R
