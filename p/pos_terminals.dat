2500|$|In 1973 IBM {{introduced}} {{point of}} sale (<b>POS)</b> <b>terminals</b> in which electronic cash registers were networked to the store mainframe computer. By the 1980s bar code readers were added. These technologies automated inventory management. Wal-Mart was an early adopter of POS. [...] The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated [...] that bar code scanners at checkout increased ringing speed by 30% and reduced labor requirements of cashiers and baggers by 10-15%.|$|E
2500|$|Today, {{point of}} sale systems scan the barcode (usually EAN or UPC) for each item, {{retrieve}} the price from a database, calculate deductions for items on sale (or, in British retail terminology, [...] "special offer", [...] "multibuy" [...] or [...] "buy one, get one free"), calculate the sales tax or VAT, calculate differential rates for preferred customers, actualize inventory, time and date stamp the transaction, record the transaction in detail including each item purchased, record the method of payment, keep totals for each product or type of product sold as well as total sales for specified periods, and do other tasks as well. These <b>POS</b> <b>terminals</b> will often also identify the cashier on the receipt, and carry additional information or offers.|$|E
2500|$|Ticket {{machines}} {{operate at}} every Luas stop {{and these are}} the only source of single-journey and return tickets. They also sell 1-day, 7-day and 30-day tickets, valid in either some or all the fare zones, for adults, children and students. It is also possible to purchase 'Combi' tickets valid on Dublin Bus and Luas. DART and Luas 'Combi' tickets have been produced since Luas opened but despite this being a major ticket option these LUAS-DART Combis are not available at either ticket newsagents or online from either Iarnród Éireann or Luas, nor are they available in Luas vending machines. They are available only from Iarnród Éireann ticket offices. Transport user lobby groups like 'Rail Users Ireland' have written to both Luas and Iarnród Éireann asking for an explanation for this and none has been forthcoming. [...] While it is also possible to purchase Luas-DART-Dublin Bus triple combi tickets (from Iarnród Éireann booking offices) from monthly ramblers upward, these are often more expensive than simply topping up a Leap card to its weekly cap rate (currently €40 for Adults). Certain ticket combinations are not possible (for example a one-day student ticket), and tickets can only be valid from the stop at which they are purchased and must commence their validity within 90 minutes, valid until a specific time shown on the card. Certain tickets require the user to hold an ID card and write the number on the ticket, to prevent the ticket from being transferred to another person. Ticket machines accept card payments (by American Express, Laser, MasterCard, or Visa and have a weekly limit of [...] €150 (upper limit changed from €50 per transaction to €150 per week in January 2012 after upgrading all <b>POS</b> <b>terminals</b> to have a PIN keypad). Formerly €5 was the minimum amount which could be paid via card but this limit has since been removed. Like other Irish transport operators, Luas has taken to requiring students to purchase a special Student Travelcard, not recognising their student cards as enough to get a discount. [...] These have been merged with the Leap Cards to form a personalised orange Leap card with new benefits such as lower daily caps.|$|E

50|$|When {{writing an}} {{application}} for a <b>POS</b> <b>terminal,</b> the developer is faced {{with the need to}} write to the specific file system of the equipment. The POSXML language works with files of type WALK dbFile (A file system defined by the framework that interprets a program compiled POSXML). This file system WALK dbFile uses the format: key = buffer \ n key = buffer \ n, basically the format of text files in a Unix environment, where \ n is used to wrap.

40|$|Abstract. Despite the {{advanced}} {{capabilities of the}} chip-enabled, debit and credit cards, fraud in payment transactions has not diminished- it has shifted. The reason lies in {{the lack of a}} trusted communication path between the smartcard and the cardholder. More explicitly, because users have no means of verifying the authenticity of the Point-of-Sales (<b>POS)</b> <b>terminal,</b> they do not know how much they are about to pay nor to whom. We propose to use the camera-enabled mobile phone and a previously shared secret to create a two-way, secure communication channel. Messages from the card are displayed by the <b>POS</b> <b>terminal</b> as visual codes, then captured and decoded by the phone. Messages from the cardholder are computed by the phone and manually typed in as one-time PINs. We extend the EMV payment protocol to provide explicit verification and confirmation of the transaction amount. In the process we also improve cardholder authentication, protect against stolen PIN and cards, and eliminate the <b>POS</b> <b>terminal</b> from the trust chain altogether. The implementation requires minimal software updates and no hardware modifications. ...|$|R

50|$|Shrinkage {{in retail}} that {{is caused by}} {{employee}} actions typically occurs {{at the point of}} sale (<b>POS)</b> <b>terminal.</b> There are different ways to manipulate a POS system, such as a cashier giving customers unauthorized discounts, creating fraudulent returns, or simply removing cash from the register. These transactions that differ from normal transactions are called POS exceptions. Traditionally POS fraud is fought by surveillance staff monitoring a <b>POS</b> <b>terminal</b> or by manually searching in surveillance video recordings. Modern POS systems can have automatic alerts when specific exceptions are detected. Also exception reports and listings based on employees, refunds, price overrides, terminals etc. are possible to detect with modern systems.
