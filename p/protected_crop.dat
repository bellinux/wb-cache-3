50|$|Vavilovian mimicry can be {{classified}} as reproductive, aggressive (parasitic) and, {{in the case of}} secondary crops, mutualistic. It is a form of disjunct mimicry with the model agreeable to the dupe. In disjunct mimicry complexes, three different species are involved as model, mimic and dupe - the weed, mimicking a <b>protected</b> <b>crop</b> model, with humans as signal receivers. Vavilovian mimicry bears considerable similarity to Batesian mimicry (where a harmless organism mimics a harmful species) in that the weed does not share the properties that give the model its protection, and both the model and the dupe (in this case people) are negatively affected by it. There are some key differences, though; in Batesian mimicry the model and signal receiver are enemies (the predator would eat the protected species if it could), whereas here the crop and its human growers are in a mutualistic relationship: the crop benefits from being dispersed and protected by people, despite being eaten by them. In fact, the crop's only 'protection' relevant here is its usefulness to humans. Secondly, the weed is not eaten, but simply killed (either directly or by not planting the seed). The only motivation for killing the weed is its effect on crop yields. Farmers would prefer to have no weeds at all, but a predator would die if it had no prey to eat, even if they might be difficult to identify. Finally, there is no known equivalent of Vavilovian mimicry in ecosystems unaltered by humans.|$|E

40|$|Barrier crops {{have been}} used since the early 1950 s as a {{cultural}} control strategy for reducing the spread of non-persistently transmitted aphid-borne viruses. Since then, this strategy has been investigated by several authors, resulting {{in a wide range}} of divergent conclusions on its effectiveness. In a series of field and laboratory experiments carried out in central Spain during 1995 – 1998, we investigated the efficacy and mode of action of various barrier crops for reducing the spread of Potato virus Y and Cucumber mosaic virus in pepper. The barriers acted as natural ‘sinks’ for non-persistent viruses and did not reduce the number of aphids landing in the <b>protected</b> <b>crop,</b> as suggested by some authors. There was a significant reduction in virus spread and an increase in yield in two of the four years of trials. Such differences in the effectiveness of the barrier crop strategy show that its efficacy depends on a series of factors such as the kind of virus spread pattern (monocyclic or polycyclic), the height of the barrier crop at the time of maximum risk of infection and the extent of competition between the barrier and the <b>protected</b> <b>crop.</b> Moreover, the barrier crop should not host any potential insect pest or pathogen able to damage the <b>protected</b> <b>crop.</b> It is concluded that use of barrier crops can be an effective crop management strategy to protect against virus infection, but only under specific circumstances.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the lessons learnt during the {{development}} of a new robotic harvester (Harvey) that can autonomously harvest sweet pepper (capsicum) in <b>protected</b> <b>cropping</b> environments. Robotic harvesting offers an attractive potential solution to reducing labour costs while enabling more regular and selective harvesting, optimising crop quality, scheduling and therefore profit. Our approach combines effective vision algorithms with a novel end-effector design to enable successful harvesting of sweet peppers. We demonstrate a simple and effective vision-based algorithm for crop detection, a grasp selection method, and a novel end-effector design for harvesting. To reduce complexity of motion planning and to minimise occlusions we focus on picking sweet peppers in a <b>protected</b> <b>cropping</b> environment where plants are grown on planar trellis structures. Initial field trials in <b>protected</b> <b>cropping</b> environments, with two cultivars, demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. The results show that the robot harvester can successfully detect, grasp, and detach crop from the plant within a real <b>protected</b> <b>cropping</b> system. The novel contributions of this work have resulted in significant and encouraging improvements in sweet pepper picking success rates compared with the state-of-the-art. Future work will look at detecting sweet pepper peduncles and improving the total harvesting cycle time for each sweet pepper. The methods presented in this paper provide steps towards the goal of fully autonomous and reliable crop picking systems that will revolutionise the horticulture industry by reducing labour costs, maximising the quality of produce, and ultimately improving the sustainability of farming enterprises...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{banning of}} the most active {{chemical}} nematicides raised root-knot nematodes (RKN) as the major problem of vegetable growing in the south-east of France, with over 40 % of horticultural farms affected. Resistant (R) cultivars successfully limit nematode attacks of the crop itself and reduce nematode abundance in soil in the short term. But their use in commercial fields faces two major constraints: (1) the limited number of cultivated species with RKN R-genes available (tomate. pepper), which would lead to major changes in crop rotations with socio-economic constraints; (2) the emergence of virulent root-knot nematode populations, able to overcome the resistance conferred by some of the R-genes. Recent research showed that the durability of the resistance per se was possibly increased with an optimal choice of the R-gene or allele combination, and of the genetic background in which the major R-genes where introgressed. However, the requirement for agronomic performance, does not always allow the breeder to fully use the genetic diversity available in R-genes and genetic backgrounds. ln such cases, spatio-temporal deployment strategies of resistant cultivars in the rotation were proposed and provided some success. But combination of genetic resistance with cultivation practices including multicrop rotations, intercultural management and/or prophylactic treatments was poorly tested for its ability to provide complementary selection pressures on the pathogen populations and to increase the durability of the protection. The project aims at identifying innovative strategies across the agrosystem, cornbining varietal resistance in crop rotations with agronomic practices, for a sustainable control of RKN that infect vegetable crops in <b>protected</b> <b>crop</b> systems. This pilot and demonstrative project involves analytical and systemic aspects: il the validation of previous results on the durability of RKN genetic resistance in tomato and pepper by long-term experiments in research stations and in farms, ii/ the impact of agronomic practices on the parasitic pressure in the soil and its contribution in the increase of resistance durability, and iii/ the impact of such innovations on the yield and the economie viability for <b>protected</b> <b>crop</b> systems in a Mediterranean climate. The added value here is to combine together currently dispersed approaches based on synergistic and long-term effects, towards a satisfying level of nematode control over pluri-annual crop sequences.

To secure stable productivity and profitability, continuous and intensive monitoring and control of <b>protected</b> <b>crop</b> production environment is critical, which is labor- and time-consuming. Failure to maintain proper environmental conditions (e. g., light, temperature, humidity) leads to significant damage to crop growth and quality, therefore farmers should visit or be present close to the production area.

Methods: Experiments were conducted in a strawberry-growing greenhouse (greenhouse 1) and a cherry tomato-growing greenhouse (greenhouse 2). Selected ambient environmental variables for experiment in greenhouse 1 were air temperature and humidity, and in greenhouse 2, they were air temperature, humidity, PPFD (Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density), and CO 2 concentration. Results: Considerable spatial, vertical, and temporal variability of the ambient environments were observed. In greenhouse 1, overall temperature increased from 12 : 00 to 14 : 00 and increased after that, while RH increased continuously during the experiments. Differences between the maximum and minimum temperature and RH values were greater when one of the side windows were open than those when both of the windows were closed.

Nevertheless, improvement of upcoming method for soil cultured greenhouse has not been sufficiently achieved. Geometrical complexity of ground in <b>protected</b> <b>crop</b> cultivation might be one {{of the most}} dominant factors in design of autonomous vehicle. While there is a practical solution fairly enough to promise an accurate travelling, such as autonomous sprayer guided by rail or induction coil, for various reasons including the limitation of producer’s budget, the previously developed sprayer has not been widely distributed to market. Methods: In this study, we developed an autonomous sprayer considering travelling performance on geometrical complexity of ground in soil cultured greenhouse.

40|$|Background: Resistant cultivars are key {{elements}} for pathogen control and pesticide reduction, but their repeated use {{may lead to}} the emergence of virulent pathogen populations, able to overcome the resistance. Increased research efforts, mainly based on theoretical studies, explore spatio-temporal deployment strategies of resistance genes in order to maximize their durability. We evaluated experimentally three of these strategies to control root-knot nematodes: cultivar mixtures, alternating and pyramiding resistance genes, under controlled and field conditions over a 3 -years period, assessing the efficiency and the durability of resistance in a <b>protected</b> <b>crop</b> rotation system with pepper as summer crop and lettuce as winter crop. Results: The choice of the resistance gene and the genetic background in which it is introgressed, affected the frequency of resistance breakdown. The pyramiding of two different resistance genes in one genotype suppressed the emergence of virulent isolates. Alternating different resistance genes in rotation was also efficient to decrease virulent populations in fields due to the specificity of the virulence and the trapping effect of resistant plants. Mixing resistant cultivars together appeared as a less efficient strategy to control nematodes. Conclusions: This work provides experimental evidence that, in a cropping system with seasonal sequences of vegetable species, pyramiding or alternating resistance genes benefit yields in the long-term by increasing the durability of resistant cultivars and improving the long-term control of a soil-borne pest. To our knowledge, this result is the first one obtained for a plant-nematode interaction, which helps demonstrate the general applicability of such strategies for breeding and sustainable management of resistant cultivars against pathogens...|$|E
40|$|In Tunisia, {{greenhouse}} crops are damaged by Aphis gossypii Glover and Myzus persicae Sulzer (Ben Halima Kamel 1991; Ben Halima Kamel and Ben Hamouda 1993, 1998).

There are several ways of controlling these pests with chemical control being the most widely used. This method has more disadvantages than benefits (Gibson et al. 1982). The use of natural enemies to control aphids is an effective way of improving the yield and quality of protected crops. There are many studies on the following naturally occurring enemies of A. gossypii: Aphidius matricariae Haliday, Lysiphlebus fabarum Marshall, Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani), Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer) (Ben Halima Kamel and Ben Hamouda 1998) and Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson) (Ben Halima Kamel, unpublished data, 1999).
