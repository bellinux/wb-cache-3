2500|$|In eastern North America caribou are {{classified}} into three ecotypes – [...] "the mountain caribou which is found {{south of the}} St. Lawrence River, the barren-ground caribou which calves in the tundra, and in between, the forest-dwelling ecotype which lives all year long in the boreal forest. In west-central Alberta there are two ecotypes – boreal and mountain. In Québec there are three ecotypes with specific habitats and behaviour – migratory barren-ground ecotype, the mountain ecotype and the forest-dwelling ecotype (boreal caribou). In British Columbia caribou {{are classified}} into three ecotypes – Mountain, Northern, and Boreal.

50|$|A caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou, {{and other}} trinomials under Rangifer tarandus) is any of several North American subspecies, ecotypes, populations, and herds {{of the species}} Rangifer tarandus, or reindeer. In North America caribou vary in size from the smallest, the <b>Peary</b> <b>caribou,</b> to the largest, the boreal {{woodland}} caribou. The North American range of caribou extends from Alaska, through the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, into the boreal forest and south through the Canadian Rockies and the Columbia and Selkirk Mountains. Barren-ground, Porcupine caribou and <b>Peary</b> <b>caribou</b> live in the tundra, while the shy woodland caribou prefers the boreal forest. Two major subspecies in North America, the Porcupine caribou and the barren-ground caribou, form large herds and undertake lengthy seasonal migrations from birthing grounds, to summer and winter feeding grounds in the tundra and taiga. The migrations of Porcupine caribou herds are among the longest of any terrestrial mammal. Barren-ground caribou are also found in Kitaa in Greenland, but the larger herds are in Alaska, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.|$|E
5000|$|The {{woodland}} caribou {{is the largest}} of the North American caribou subspecies. Their legs and heads are longer than the barren-ground caribou. The Porcupine, barren-ground Bluenose caribou herd, and {{woodland caribou}} all occupy Gwich'in land. According to traditional knowledge woodland caribou are easily distinguishable from Porcupine caribou. They are much bigger than the Porcupine caribou [...] "half between a caribou and a moose." [...] <b>Peary</b> <b>caribou</b> are the size of a deer.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Peary</b> <b>caribou</b> migrate {{seasonally}} up to 150 km each way. They occupy high arctic islands, including Banks Island, Prince of Wales Island (Nunavut), Somerset Island (Nunavut) and the Queen Elizabeth Islands.

[...] In the winter, they [...] "inhabit areas where the snow is not too deep such as rugged uplands, beach ridges and rocky outcrops." ...|$|E
