40|$|Background We lack {{national}} and cross-national studies of physicians’ perceptions {{of quality of}} patient care, professional autonomy, and job satisfaction to inform clinicians and policymakers. This study aims to compare such perceptions in Canada, the United States (U. S.), and Norway. Methods We analyzed data from large, nationwide, representative samples of physicians in Canada (n =  3, 213), the U. S. (n =  6, 628), and Norway (n =  657), examining demographics, job satisfaction, and professional autonomy. Results Among U. <b>S.</b> <b>physicians,</b> 79 % strongly agreed/agreed they could provide high quality patient care vs. only 46 % of Canadian and 59 % of Norwegian <b>physicians.</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>physicians</b> also perceived more clinical autonomy and time with their patients, with differences remaining significant even after controlling for age, gender, and clinical hours. Women reported less adequate time, clinical freedom, and ability to provide high-quality care. Country differences were the strongest predictors for the professional autonomy variables. In all three countries, physicians’ perceptions of quality of care, clinical freedom, and time with patients influenced their overall job satisfaction. Fewer U. <b>S.</b> <b>physicians</b> reported their overall job satisfaction to be at-least-somewhat satisfied than did Norwegian and Canadian <b>physicians.</b> Conclusions U. <b>S.</b> <b>physicians</b> perceived higher quality of patient care and greater professional autonomy, but somewhat lower job satisfaction than their colleagues in Norway and Canada. Differences in health care system financing and delivery might help explain this difference; Canada and Norway have more publicly-financed, not-for-profit health care delivery systems, vs. a more-privately-financed and profit-driven system in the U.

40|$|Although video-based {{teleconferencing}} {{is becoming}} more widespread in the medical profession, especially for scheduled consultations, applications for rapid assessment of acute medical problems are rare.

40|$|The New Lebanon Shaker {{community}} {{developed the}} Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Order</b> for {{the offspring of}} adult converts primarily because they believed 2 ̆ 2 worldly 2 ̆ 2 family relationships hindered spiritual 2 ̆ 2 travel. 2 ̆ 2 Children were isolated from the adults for two main reasons: first, the Shakers were a celibate society and did not recognize marital and affectional relationships within their community; and secondly, the Shakers believed socialization and control of both adults and children into the Shaker way of life would be more successful if the children and adults were separated;This research traces {{the development of the}} New Lebanon Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Order</b> from the founding of the United Society of Believers in America to 1900. The primary focus of the study is how the Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Order</b> contributed to the gradual demise of the Society after the 1840 s. The history of the Shakers, gathering children into the Society, and their daily life, education, and conduct, are discussed;The conclusions of this research suggest that the process in the Society of separating children from adults also separated children from the future of the sect. Children 2 ̆ 7 s caretakers and teachers {{did not seem to be}} able to instill in the youth a long-lasting regard for the Society 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs or a spiritual commitment to its perpetuation, nor were they able to supplant the children 2 ̆ 7 s needs for emotionally intimate relationships;In some ways this research revises earlier studies that suggest a more positive emotional environment existed in the Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Order</b> during the nineteenth century. It is not suggested that children were neglected physically at any point in Shaker history, but when the complex issues of socialization to promote commitment, the value of emotionally intimate relationships and family affectional ties, and the costs and rewards of membership are evaluated, a different picture of the New Lebanon Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Order</b> during the nineteenth century seems more likely...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the interaction between}} price and inventory decisions in an oligopoly industry {{and its implications for}} the dynamics of prices. The work extends existing literature and especially the work of Hall and Rust (2007) to endogenous prices and strategic oligopoly competition. We show that the optimal decision rule is an (<b>S,</b> <b>s)</b> <b>order</b> policy and prices and inventory are strategic substitutes. Fixed ordering costs generate infrequent orders. Consequently, with strategic competition in prices, (S, s) inventory behavior together with demand uncertainty generates endogenous cyclical patterns in prices without any exogenous shocks. Hence, the developed model provides a promising framework for explaining dynamics of commodity markets and especially observed autocorrelation in price fluctuations.

40|$|Concerning {{the dilemma}} {{of whether or not}} to {{withhold}} antibiotics, it is clear that there are many factors that must be taken into consideration. The aim {{of this article is to}} identify and address these factors. The issues discussed are done so in light of different ethical theories, as well as the current law regulating patients rights and physicians obligations. This article focuses especially on how to weigh the demands and needs of the individual patient against future patients rights to receive adequate antibiotic treatment. There are no wrong or right answers to many of the questions asked in this article, though it becomes evident that too great an emphasis on the present and a disregard of the future, may prove too costly for society. A restrictive attitude towards administration of antibiotics is imperative in preventing further resistance. Therefore, individual sacrifices may be necessary in order to save future patients. Another dilemma that is debated in this article, is what influences decisions concerning whether or not to administer antibiotics to elderly, ill patients, especially those suffering from dementia, and how beneficial antibiotics are in the given situations with regards to survival and comfort. There are a number of elements that influence a <b>physician</b> <b>s</b> decision to give a patient antibiotics, such as the patient s, the relatives and the <b>physician</b> <b>s</b> own attitudes towards antibiotics given in the final stages of life, and the general attitude towards antibiotics in the region. Although research in this field is lacking, the few studies that do exist suggest that in elderly patients with advanced dementia, antibiotic treatment has little or no impact on survival. It can therefore be argued that antibiotics should be withheld in these patients...|$|R
