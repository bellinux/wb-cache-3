The city arms of Kiruna were granted in 1949, and the municipal arms were registered in 1974. Blazon: Party per fess: Argent, the Iron alchemical symbol azure; Azure, a <b>ptarmigan</b> argent. Sparking local political controversy, the <b>ptarmigan</b> received red claws and beak in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens are {{omnivorous}} {{and highly}} opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity. For example, those foraging on tundra on the Arctic North Slope of Alaska obtained about half their energy needs from predation, mainly of microtine rodents, and half by scavenging, mainly of caribou and <b>ptarmigan</b> carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Over 200 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in the area including black guillemot, eider, peregrine falcon and the golden eagle. In 1981 there were 28 <b>ptarmigan</b> on Arran, but in 2009 {{it was reported that}} extensive surveys had been unable to record any. Similarly, the red-billed chough no longer breeds on the island.|$|E

5|$|There {{are more}} than 100 bird species in the park, {{including}} Eurasian eagle-owl, rock <b>ptarmigan,</b> alpine accentor, and chough. Golden eagles nest on rocky ledges, and sometimes in trees. Wallcreeper are found on steep cliffs. There are black woodpeckers and nutcrackers in the park's woodlands.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{variable}} snow camouflage {{is a type}} {{of seasonal}} polyphenism with a distinct winter plumage or pelage. It is found in birds such as the rock <b>ptarmigan,</b> lagomorphs such as the Arctic hare, mustelids such as the stoat, and one canid, the Arctic fox. Since these have evolved separately, the similar appearance is due to convergent evolution. Some high Arctic species like the snowy owl and polar bear however remain white all year round.|$|E
5|$|On {{a longer}} timescale, animals like the Arctic hare, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock <b>ptarmigan</b> have snow camouflage, {{changing}} their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey {{in the summer}} to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round.|$|E
50|$|The varied {{vegetation}} {{supports a}} variety of birds and animals.Elk are often found on Renskär-Getskär, and resident mammals include fox, squirrel, ermine and plentiful hares. The Papilio machaon butterfly can sometimes be seen.Characteristic birds on Renskär-Getskär include pine grosbeaks, black grouses, rock <b>ptarmigans</b> and capercaillies.Likskär is relatively barren, but at Hedmarkerna there are willow <b>ptarmigans,</b> wheatears, Temminck's stints and turnstones.Herring gulls, terns, guillemots and ruddy turnstones nest on Likskärsrevet and Ligogrunnan, and there are spotted redshanks on the smaller islands.|$|R

50|$|In the Pliocene on the Balkan {{peninsula}} peafowl (Bravard's peafowl) coexisted with <b>ptarmigans</b> (Lagopus) Peafowl {{were widely}} {{spread on the}} Balkan peninsula and the Southeast Europe {{until the end of}} the Pliocene.|$|R
5|$|Some {{animals of}} the far north, like the showshoe and Arctic hares, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock <b>ptarmigan</b> change their coat colour (by {{moulting}} and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey summer camouflage to white in the winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in the far north of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round. Since these animals in widely separated groups have evolved separately, the similarity of coloration is due to convergent evolution, on the presumption that natural selection favours a particular coloration in a particular environment.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 260 {{species of birds}} have been recorded, with raptors such as the bald eagle, golden eagle, {{peregrine}} falcon, osprey and several species of hawks residing year round. The harlequin duck is a colorful species of waterfowl found in the lakes and waterways. The great blue heron, tundra swan, Canada goose and American wigeon are species of waterfowl more commonly encountered in the park. Great horned owl, Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, pileated woodpecker and cedar waxwing reside in the dense forests along the mountainsides, and in the higher altitudes, the <b>ptarmigan,</b> timberline sparrow and rosy finch {{are the most likely}} to be seen. The Clark's nutcracker is less plentiful than in past years due to the {{decline in the number of}} whitebark pines.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the harsh}} winters, {{the park has}} few reptile and {{amphibian}} species with only one species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds {{can be found in}} Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the gray jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed <b>ptarmigan</b> is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.|$|E
5000|$|Lagopus {{is a small}} genus {{of birds}} in the grouse subfamily, {{commonly}} known as <b>ptarmigans.</b> The genus contains three living species with numerous described subspecies, all living in tundra or cold upland areas.|$|R
25|$|The only land {{birds are}} snow {{buntings}} and rock <b>ptarmigans,</b> but {{the island is}} very rich in seabirds that nest on the southern cliffs. Other species visit the island during their seasonal migration between Svalbard's northern islands and mainland Europe.|$|R

5|$|On {{the high}} {{mountain}} tops, species including <b>ptarmigan,</b> mountain hare and stoat {{can be seen}} in their white colour phase during winter months. Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist and within these areas the Scottish crossbill, the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and pine marten. Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed sea eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s, and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.|$|E
5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The taiga is dominated by coniferous trees, notably balsam fir and black spruce, though the deciduous white birch, trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow <b>ptarmigan,</b> common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E
5|$|The normal {{reaction}} of a prey animal to an attacking predator is to flee by any available means, whether flying, gliding, falling, swimming, running, jumping, burrowing or rolling, {{according to the}} animal's capabilities. Escape paths are often erratic, {{making it difficult for}} the predator to predict which way the prey will go next: for example, birds such as snipe, <b>ptarmigan</b> and black-headed gulls evade fast raptors such as peregrine falcons with zigzagging or jinking flight. In the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia in particular, many vertebrates escape predators by falling and gliding. Among the insects, many moths turn sharply, fall, or perform a powered dive in response to the sonar clicks of bats. Among fish, the stickleback follows a zigzagging path, often doubling back erratically, when chased by a fish-eating merganser duck.|$|E
50|$|There {{are more}} than 100 bird species in the {{protected}} area. Birds of prey include bearded vulture, golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl. Other birds found in the park are black woodpeckers, rock <b>ptarmigans,</b> Alpine accentors, nutcrackers, choughs and black grouses.The wallcreeper is found on steep cliffs especially for nesting.|$|R
50|$|The high {{mountains}} {{of the park}} are too barren for many creatures to thrive, but there the <b>ptarmigans</b> thrive. Golden eagles nest in several valleys that reach up towards the glacier and they feed on the <b>ptarmigans</b> in the glacial areas. Meadow pipits are the most abundant species above the tree line. In the wooded areas below the tree line, red deer are abundant, in fact more red deer are shot in Kvinnherad municipality {{than anywhere else in}} the country. Black grouse and capercaillie can also be found in the pine forests. This is also one of the last places to find the white-backed woodpecker in all of Western Europe. Avalanches in this area leave many dead trees in their paths and this is exactly the habitat favoured by these woodpeckers.|$|R
500|$|Also defined herewith: phaneric plumage. Plumage of a {{bird that}} is camouflaging. For example, the white winter plumage of <b>ptarmigans</b> is cryptic as it serves to conceal it in snowy environments. The opposite, [...] "advertising" [...] plumage, is termed [...] "phaneric", such as male birds in {{colourful}} [...] for sexual display, making them stand out to a high degree.|$|R
5|$|The {{vegetation}} on {{both sides}} of the fjord is High Arctic steppe, which is characterized by grasses. It is caused by extremely low precipitation, basic earth with salt deposits in the surface, and large areas of exposed mineral earth. The area around the fjord has a unique vegetation, which has not preserved in other areas of Svalbard. Along with vegetation found on nesting cliffs, it is the most exclusive flora in Svalbard. There are several unique species in the national park, including , which is featured in the national park's logo and for which Svalbard is the only known location in Europe, Puccinellia svalbardensis, Gentianella tenella and Kobresia simpliciuscula. There is breeding ground for pink-footed goose within the park, although Svalbard <b>ptarmigan</b> can also be found. Animals that can be found in the park include polar bear, Svalbard reindeer and Arctic fox.|$|E
5|$|The tundra is a sub-Arctic zone with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Precipitation is low. Soil a meter {{below ground}} and deeper is {{permanently}} frozen (permafrost), {{which does not}} allow water to drain easily through the soil, so it collects in shallow pools. Trees and shrubs are stunted since their roots cannot grow into the permafrost. Low shrubs, lichens, mosses, and small herbaceous plants are found instead. The most common mammals on the tundra are the barren-ground caribou, Arctic wolf, Arctic fox, Arctic hare, lemmings, and voles. Occasional sightings of muskoxen have been made near Cape Chidley, Labrador's most northerly point. The polar bear is the dominant carnivore of the tundra, but is an occasional visitor to coastal Newfoundland, especially in the spring. Many birds migrate to Labrador in spring to lay their eggs and raise their young before returning south for the winter, including the common eider, harlequin duck, Common redpoll and American pipit. The Labrador tundra is also permanent home to <b>ptarmigan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many birds call Adams home or a {{stopover}} {{on their}} migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique songbird {{to the high}} elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. Raptors {{that live in the}} forest and meadows include Accipiters, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the hairy woodpecker, downy woodpecker, and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller's jay and gray jay are common and the gray jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark's nutcracker with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds can be found on many of the lakes as well. The American dipper with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several grouse species, the sooty, spruce, and ruffed grouse and the white-tailed <b>ptarmigan,</b> call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.|$|E
5000|$|Tookoome {{took the}} advice to heart and began hunting bigger animals <b>ptarmigans</b> with the whip, {{even after his}} family {{acquired}} a rifle and a snowmobile. He took down several caribou, and once even used it to kill a wolf that he had shot and injured. He kept the whip with him because operating a rifle was too expensive.|$|R
5000|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times; they were granted on 3 February 1984. The arms show three white Willow <b>Ptarmigans</b> (Lagopus lagopus) {{on a blue}} background. The birds are plentiful {{in the area and}} hunting them was of great importance historically for the inhabitants to survive during the winters in the area. The bird was thus chosen as a symbol for the municipality.|$|R
5000|$|The Rocky Mountains {{are home}} to over 300 species of birds. These include raptor species that migrate through the mountains, such as golden eagles, bald eagles, and ospreys.

5|$|While {{work on the}} Synopsis of Quadrupeds {{was still}} in progress, Pennant decided on a journey to Scotland, a {{relatively}} unexplored country and not previously visited by a naturalist. He set out in June 1769 and kept a journal and made sketches as he travelled. He visited the Farne Islands off the Northumberland coast on the way and was much impressed by the breeding seabird colonies. He entered Scotland via Berwick-on-Tweed and proceeded via Edinburgh and up the east coast, continuing through Perth, Aberdeen and Inverness. His return journey south took him through Fort William, Glen Awe, Inverary and Glasgow. He was unimpressed by the climate but was interested in all he saw and made enquiries about the local economy. He described in detail the scenery around Loch Ness. He enthused over the Arctic char, a fish new to him but did not mention a monster in the lake. He observed red deer, black grouse, white hares and <b>ptarmigan.</b> He saw the capercaillie in the forests of Glenmoriston and Strathglass and mentioned the pine grosbeak, the only occasion on which it has been recorded from Scotland. He enquired into the fisheries and commerce of the different places he passed through and visited the great houses, reporting on the antiquities he found there. He finished his journey by visiting Edinburgh again and travelling through Moffat, Gretna and Carlisle {{on his way back}} to Wales, having taken about three months on his travels. On his return home, Pennant wrote an account of his tour in Scotland which met with some acclaim and which may have been responsible for an increase in the number of English people visiting the country.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ptarmigan</b> were {{preserved}} by freezing or drying after being plucked or skinned. Once dried, the birds commonly were eaten without any other preparation. As with many dried foods, seal oil a frequent to dried <b>ptarmigan.</b> <b>Ptarmigan</b> were also cooked by boiling and were often {{the basis for}} soups.|$|E
25|$|Although absent or rare in {{some areas}} where the golden eagle occurs, this {{is by far the}} most {{significant}} family of birds in the diet of golden eagles, making up 10.3% of their known prey. In Scandinavia and the Baltic States, grouse are the primary prey for these eagles, comprising between 47.6% and 63.3% of their diet, and displacing mammals altogether. The main prey species in most of this sizeable area is the largest species of grouse, the western capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), supplemented by its cousins, the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and the hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia). However, in the northernmost parts of Scandinavia, these are replaced by the smaller willow <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus lagopus) and rock <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus muta). A study in Belarus showed grouse were the most common family of prey at 47.8% of the eagle diet. In Estonia, the prey base is more varied, but grouse were still the most represented bird family, comprising 18.1%. The red grouse, a race of willow <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus lagopus scotica), and the rock <b>ptarmigan</b> (also called just <b>ptarmigan)</b> occur heavily in the golden eagle's diet in parts of Scotland, up to 47.8% in one study. One paper in Alaska showed that the two <b>ptarmigan</b> species (primarily the more abundant willow) made up 49.1% of the remains in a golden eagle pair's nest, making it the only known study in North America where birds were more prevalent in the diet than mammals. Other reports from Alaska show the willow <b>ptarmigan</b> as secondary prey. In some other areas, grouse are taken only as supplemental prey. A study in the Italian Alps revealed grouse made up 19.4% of nest remains and were the most common avian prey. In eastern Washington state, sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus) was the second most significant prey species (at 13%) after yellow-bellied marmot. Considered globally, it is likely that every species of grouse is prey of the golden eagle at least somewhere.|$|E
50|$|Forest species flock only {{in autumn}} and winter, though {{individuals}} tolerate {{each other when}} they meet. Prairie species are more social, and tundra species (<b>ptarmigans,</b> Lagopus) are the most social, forming flocks of up to 100 in winter. All grouse {{spend most of their}} time on the ground, though when alarmed, they may take off in a flurry and go into a long glide.|$|R
5000|$|The game (now {{distributed}} as Die Original Moorhuhn Jagd) {{was developed}} by the Dutch Witan studios and the Art Department advertising agency as an advertisement for Johnnie Walker whisky in 1999. Imitating the Glorious Twelfth, the game's objective was to shoot down, through a point-and-click interface, as many cartoonish [...] "swamp chickens" [...] (Moorhühner; literally [...] "moorhens", i.e. willow <b>ptarmigans)</b> as possible in 90 seconds.|$|R
5|$|The most {{predominant}} {{plant species}} in the alpine zone around the pass are the grass species adapted to the harsh climate. Other alpine flora, such as moss and lichens on the rocks, and wildflowers in season, make appearances. Shrubs that survive among them include strawberry, snowberry, willows and bog birch. Animals in the alpine zone include <b>ptarmigans,</b> small burrowing species like pika, marmots, and pocket gopher, and mountain goats.|$|R
