40|$|Two {{organically}} modified {{layered silicates}} (with {{small and large}} diameters) were incorporated into three segmented polyurethanes with various degrees of microphase separation. Microphase separation increased with the molecular weight of the poly(hexamethylene oxide) soft segment. The molecular weight of the soft segment did not influence the amount of polyurethane intercalating the interlayer spacing. Small-angle neutron scattering and differential scanning calorimetry data indicated that the layered silicates {{did not affect the}} microphase morphology of any host polymer, regardless of the particle diameter. The stiffness enhancement on filler addition increased as the microphase separation of the polyurethane decreased, presumably because a greater number of urethane linkages were available to interact with the filler. For comparison, the small nanofiller was introduced into a polyurethane with a <b>poly(tetramethylene</b> <b>oxide)</b> soft segment, and {{a significant increase in the}} tensile strength and a sharper upturn in the stress-strain curve resulted. No such improvement occurred in the host polymers with poly(hexamethylene oxide) soft segments. It is proposed that the nanocomposite containing the more hydrophilic and mobile <b>poly(tetramethylene</b> <b>oxide)</b> soft segment is capable of greater secondary bonding between the polyurethane chains and the organosilicate surface, resulting in improved stress transfer to the filler and reduced molecular slippage.

The poly(ester-ether) s were synthesized by transesterification reaction of dimethyl succinate, 1, 4 -butanediol and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, Mn = 1000 g/mol) in the first series, and <b>poly(tetramethylene</b> <b>oxide)</b> (PTMO, Mn = 1000 g/mol) in the second. The mass fraction of soft segments was varied between 10 and 50 mass. %. The effect of the introduction of two different polyether soft segments on the structure, thermal and rheological properties were investigated. The composition of the poly(ester-ether) s, determined from their 1 H-NMR spectra, showed that incorporation of soft polyether segments was successfully performed by the transesterification reaction in bulk. The molecular weight was estimated from solution viscosity measurements and complex dynamic viscosities. The thermal properties investigated by DSC indicated that the presence of soft segments lowers the melting and crystallization temperature of the hard phase, as well as the degree of crystallinity. Dynamical mechanical analysis was used to investigate the influence of composition on the rheological behavior of the segmented poly(ester-ether) s.

40|$|A {{series of}} poly(ether-ester) s derived from {{dimethyl}} terephthalate (DMT), dimethyl fumarate (DMF), 1, 4 -butandiol (BD) and <b>poly(tetramethylene</b> <b>oxide)</b> (PTMO,Mn = 1000 g/mol) was synthesized in a two stage process involving transesterification and polycondensation in the melt. The mole {{ratio of the}} starting components was selected to result in copolymers with a constant hard:soft segment wieght ratio (56 : 44). The amount of DMF was 10 mol %, referred to {{the total amount of}} the esters used. The synthesis was optimized in terms of both the concentration of catalyst, tetra-n-butyl-titanate, Ti(OBu) 4 and thermal stabilizer N,N-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine, DPPD, as well as the temperature. The composition and structure of the synthesized poly(ether-ester) s were characterized by 1 H-NMR. The number average molecular weights of the polymers calculated from the 1 H-NMR spectra were compared with the corresponding values of the inherent viscosity (hinh) in m-cresol and the complex dynamic viscosity (h *). The effect of the content of fumaric residues on the thermal properties of the synthesized copolyesters was also investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) ...|$|R
40|$|Polyurethane triblock {{copolymers}} were synthesized by reacting 4, 4 -methylenebis(phenyl isocyanate) (MDI) -endcapped <b>poly(tetramethylene</b> <b>oxide)</b> (PTMO) with mono-amine-amide (MMA) units. Four different MMA {{units were}} used, i. e. no-amide (6 m), mono-amide (6 B), di-amide (6 T 6 m) and tri-amide (6 T 6 B), based on hexylamine (6 m), 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine (6), terephthalic acid (T), and benzoic acid (B). The PTMO had a molecular weight of 2000 g/mol. Thermal and thermo-mechanical properties were studied {{by means of}} differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis, respectively. The structure of the carbonyl bond was explored by infra-red analysis and the elastic behavior of the materials by compression set experiments. The triblock polyurethanes with mono-disperse, hard end-segments displayed low molecular weights (3200 - 3800 g/mol). The crystallinity of the MDI urethane-urea group was found {{to depend on the}} structure of the amide. Increasing the number of amide bonds in the mono-disperse hard segment increased the modulus and the hard segment melting temperature, and decreased the compression set values. The low temperature properties were hardly affected by the amide lengt...|$|R
