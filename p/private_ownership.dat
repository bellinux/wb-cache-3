40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the impact of firm {{ownership}} in a differentiated industry. We find there is no effect on product differentia-tion and welfare due to ownership ratio change between private and state so long as the <b>private</b> (state) <b>ownership</b> in a partially state-owned firm remains at least half (less than half). However, when the <b>private</b> (state) <b>ownership</b> in the partially state-owned firm falls below half (rises more than half), the degree of product differentiation increases (decreases) whereas welfare decreases (increases) in the share of private (state) own-ership; and thus the extent of <b>private</b> or state <b>ownership</b> matters. ...|$|R
5|$|The castle {{had begun}} to suffer damage from the sea by the early 17th century, and {{by the middle of}} the 19th century, the {{receding}} coastline had reached the edge of the castle walls. The high costs of repair contributed to the government's decision to sell the site off in 1888. It was initially bought by a railway company and then passed into <b>private</b> <b>ownership.</b> Coastal erosion continued and by the 1950s, the southern part of the castle had been destroyed by the sea. The remaining castle was restored between 1975 and 1979 by Peter and Barbara McGregor, who turned the keep into a private residence. In the 21st century, Sandgate remains in <b>private</b> <b>ownership,</b> and is protected under UK law as a grade I listed building.|$|E

5|$|The chief threats {{faced by}} the brolga, {{particularly}} {{in the southern part}} of its range, are habitat destruction, the drainage of wetlands, collision with powerlines, and predation by the introduced red fox.
