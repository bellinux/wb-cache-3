2500|$|Pullman has {{singled out}} certain {{elements}} of Christianity for criticism, {{as in the}} following: [...] "I suppose technically, you'd have to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> as an agnostic. But {{if there is a}} God, and he is as the Christians describe him, then he deserves to be put down and rebelled against". However, Pullman has also said in interviews and appearances that his argument can extend to all religions.|$|E
2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down,</b> he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You're {{doing it}} now!" [...] cried Miss Gleason, with delight. [...] "I {{could not do}} a thing to resist your <b>putting</b> <b>me</b> <b>down!</b> Of course you don't know that you're doing it; it's purely involuntary. And you wouldn't {{know that he was}} {{dominating}} you. And he would n't." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{second reason}} is that role {{reversal}} helps the protagonist observe himself {{as if in a}} mirror. Through playing her mother's role, the daughter sees the role of daughter from her mother's perspective. Yablonsky provides the daughter description, for example: [...] "From the vantage point of my mother, I saw {{for the first time that}} she feels badly about her age and her looks and is <b>putting</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> because she has begun to compete with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Finest in the world," [...] {{returned}} Jesse Pelter. [...] "Better let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> you <b>down</b> {{for five}} thousand dollars' worth of shares to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|Turnbull, still {{standing}} up, opened his lips. [...] "Will you <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down,</b> please?" [...] he said, quite calmly, like on stopping an omnibus.|$|E
60|$|JANET [To ELIZABETH.] Well--I {{want you}} to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> as a {{contributor}} for twelve-and-six. [She smiles.] It's the only way I can give.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess you}} may <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> at the Events Office, just {{round the corner}} here. I've got to write up this {{interview}} while it's fresh." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{are many}} odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> my dinner exactly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] pursued Mara, {{in a tone}} of lamentation, [...] "I {{could no}} more get into a {{carriage}} and drive to Brunswick as you can, than I could fly. I can't drive, Sally--something is the matter with me; and the horses always know it the minute I take the reins; they always twitch their ears and stare round into the chaise at me, as much as to say, 'What! you there?' and I feel sure they never will mind me. And then how you can make those wonderful bargains you do, I can't see!--you talk up to the clerks and the men, and somehow you talk everybody round; but as for me, if I only open my mouth in the humblest way to dispute the price, everybody <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> <b>down.</b> I always tremble when I go into a store, and people talk to me just as if I was a little girl, and once or twice they have made me buy things that I knew I didn't want, just because they will talk me down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'And does {{an honest}} and capable {{business}} man stand to [...] lose or gain by {{the coming of}} such a Socialist [...] Government? I submit that, on the whole, he stands to [...] gain. Let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the essential points in his [...] outlook as I conceive them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm keen on dancing," [...] said Mr. Pogis. [...] "I hope they'll {{give us a}} {{dance on}} board. Will you <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> for the first dance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Strong {{enough or}} not," [...] {{returned}} Frank, [...] "any risk {{is better than}} pining and perishing here. <b>Put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down,</b> Crayford, among those who volunteer to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|She murmured an {{incoherent}} expression, {{and tried}} to smile; saying, with a fitful aversion of her face, 'I am only frightened. <b>Put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down,</b> do put me down!' ...|$|E
6000|$|As for myself--well, I am ambitious. I don't suppose my {{ambition}} {{is a very}} lofty one, {{but such}} as it is I mean to hunt it <b>down.</b> Come. Let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> it <b>down</b> in black and white, once for all, and see how it looks: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And don't he respect me?" [...] cried Silver. [...] "Ah, {{you should}} 'a' heard <b>me</b> <b>putting</b> <b>down</b> my mutiny, George Merry and Morgan and that lot, no longer ago'n last chapter; you'd 'a' heard {{something}} then! You'd 'a' seen what the Author thinks o' me! But come now, {{do you consider}} yourself a virtuous chara'ter clean through?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “An’ {{how is it}} ye can get men to do {{anything}} on God’s earth an’ sea?” Louis demanded with Celtic fire. “How d’ye find me aboard if ’twasn’t that I was drunk as a pig when I <b>put</b> <b>me</b> name <b>down?</b> There’s them that can’t sail with better men, like the hunters, and them that don’t know, like the poor devils of wind-jammers for’ard there. But they’ll come to it, they’ll come to it, an’ be sorry the day they was born. I could weep for the poor creatures, did I but forget poor old fat Louis and the troubles before him. But ’tis not a whisper I’ve dropped, mind ye, not a whisper.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is the place," [...] {{said the}} Princess. [...] "Here is the horrid tower where my beloved is. Please <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> a minute, {{and let me}} cry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> for the platform," [...] he cried, and {{vanished}} abashed {{behind the curtain}} of his Times, where his wife found him at lunch time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{speak to}} me for several minutes, please," [...] she begged. [...] "Tell him to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> at the hotel. I can't {{go back to the}} Club just yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither fear nor favour, {{but what}} I call justice, has {{brought me to}} this judgment," [...] he said, [...] "do you that which may seem right in your eyes, and believe {{that the world is}} wide enough to hold us both, without our {{crossing}} each other's path again! If you ar' content, well; if you ar' not content, seek to ease your feelings in your own fashion. I shall not ask to be let up, when you once <b>put</b> <b>me</b> fairly <b>down.</b> And now, Doctor, have I come to your leaf in my accounts. It is time to foot up the small reckoning, that has been running on, for some time, atwixt us. With you, I entered into open and manly faith; in what manner have you kept it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Although an Ohio native, Knorek's birthplace {{is listed}} in {{official}} NBA records as Warsaw, Poland. This {{is the result of}} a joke between Knorek and Paul Taylor as Knorek signed his contract with the Knicks. [...] "When I signed my contract my friend had <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> Warsaw because he thought it was better," [...] he later explained. Knorek did speak Polish, and teammate Nat Militzok recalled that Knorek once pretended to be an ambassador from Poland while staying at a hotel on a road trip.|$|R
60|$|He took <b>me</b> <b>down</b> {{into the}} study, seated {{himself in his}} {{accustomed}} chair, and <b>put</b> <b>me</b> before him between his knees. His lips were awfully white, and I felt his two hands, as they grasped my shoulders, shaking violently.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, no, I don't accuse any one. Only if {{they like}} to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> under their feet and trample on me, they are welcome. That's all I have to say.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, I know,” Aynsley said despondently. “I’m not to {{talk like}} that. When I play the good-natured idiot people applaud, but they <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> smartly when I speak the truth.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> and run away," [...] {{continued}} the turtle. [...] "It {{will take me}} all the week to think over my plans, and decide exactly what we are to do." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "And {{then with}} a soft growl she tore open her bodice and <b>put</b> <b>me</b> to her. When she set <b>me</b> <b>down</b> she took from her pocket a little round fried cake cover with sugar and I reeled along the passage back to our door." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{trust that}} I have, at last, made my case clear, and that {{henceforth}} I shall {{be allowed to}} rest in peace--at least, after a further explanation or two, which Mr. Lilly proves to me may be necessary. It has been seen that my excellent critic has original ideas respecting {{the meaning of the}} words [...] "laboratory" [...] and [...] "chemical"; and, as it appears to me, his definition of [...] "Materialist" [...] is quite as much peculiar to himself. For, unless I misunderstand him, and I have taken pains not to do so, he <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> as a Materialist (over and above the grounds which I have shown to have no foundation); firstly, because I have said that consciousness {{is a function of the}} brain; and, secondly, because I hold by determinism. With respect to the first point, I am not aware that there is any one who doubts that, in the proper physiological sense of the word function, consciousness, in certain forms at any rate, is a cerebral function. In physiology we call function that effect, or series of effects, which results from the activity of an organ. Thus, it is the function of muscle to give rise to motion; and the muscle gives rise to motion when the nerve which {226} supplies it is stimulated. If one of the nerve-bundles in a man's arm is laid bare and a stimulus is applied to certain of the nervous filaments, the result will be production of motion in that arm. If others are stimulated, the result will be the production of the state of consciousness called pain. Now, if I trace these last nerve-filaments, I find them to be ultimately connected with part of the substance of the brain, just as the others turn out to be connected with muscular substance. If the production of motion in the one case is properly said to be the function of the muscular substance, why is the production of a state of consciousness in the other case not to be called a function of the cerebral substance? Once upon a time, it is true, it was supposed that a certain [...] "animal spirit" [...] resided in muscle and was the real active agent. But we have done with that wholly superfluous fiction so far as the muscular organs are concerned. Why are we to retain a corresponding fiction for the nervous organs? ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{you want}} an essay about American National Literature, (tremendous and fearful subject!) do you?[46] Well, if you will let <b>me</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> some melanged cogitations {{regarding}} the matter, hap-hazard, and from my own points of view, I will try. Horace Greeley wrote a book named [...] "Hints toward Reforms," [...] and the title-line was consider'd {{the best part of}} all. In the present case I will give a few thoughts and suggestions, of good and ambitious intent enough anyhow--first reiterating the question right out plainly: American National Literature--is there distinctively any such thing, or can there ever be? First to me comes an almost indescribably august form, the People, with varied typical shapes and attitudes-then the divine mirror, Literature.|$|R
6000|$|... "Safe! safe!" [...] cried Richard, joyfully, ceasing his struggles. [...] "Oh, how glad I am! That young villain {{should never}} have hurt her. <b>Put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down,</b> Osmond, {{what are you doing}} with me?" ...|$|E
60|$|SCANTLEBURY. [Behind {{his hand}} to TENCH.] Look after the Chairman! He's not well; he's not well--he had no lunch. If there's any fund started for the women and children, <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down</b> for--for twenty pounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "I detest him," [...] said Mrs. Carr to herself, [...] "at least, I think I do; but how neatly he <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>down!</b> There is {{no doubt}} about his being a gentleman, though insufferably conceited." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{looked forward}} to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had once {{looked forward to}} the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day came, and an open {{carriage}} was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up, took me in his arms, carried <b>me</b> <b>down</b> to it, and <b>put</b> <b>me</b> in, as if I were still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of the wealth of his great nature.|$|R
60|$|From {{the first}} the voyage was going wrong. Routed {{out of my}} hotel on a bitter March morning, I had crossed Baltimore and reached the pier-end {{precisely}} on time. At nine o'clock the tug was to have taken <b>me</b> <b>down</b> the bay and <b>put</b> <b>me</b> on board the Elsinore, and with growing irritation I sat frozen inside my taxicab and waited. On the seat, outside, the driver and Wada sat hunched in a temperature perhaps half a degree colder than mine. And there was no tug.|$|R
6000|$|... "My master! and {{who made}} him my master? That's what I think of--what right has he to me? I'm {{a man as}} much as he is. I'm a better man than he is. I know more about {{business}} than he does; I am a better manager than he is; I can read better than he can; I can write a better hand,--and I've learned it all myself, and no thanks to him,--I've learned it in spite of him; and now what right has he to make a dray-horse of me?--to take me from things I can do, and do better than he can, and <b>put</b> <b>me</b> to work that any horse can do? He tries to do it; he says he'll bring <b>me</b> <b>down</b> and humble <b>me,</b> and he <b>puts</b> <b>me</b> to just the hardest, meanest and dirtiest work, on purpose!" ...|$|R
