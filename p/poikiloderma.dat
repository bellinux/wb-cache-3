The condition was first described by pioneer American pediatrician Abraham Jacobi in 1906. PVA causes areas of affected skin to appear speckled red and inflamed, yellowish and/or brown, gray or grayish-black, with scaling and a thinness that may be described as [...] "cigarette paper". On the surface of the skin, these areas may range in size from small patches, to plaques (larger, raised areas), to neoplasms (spreading, tumor-like growths on the skin).|$|E

5000|$|Large plaque parapsoriasis (also {{known as}} [...] "parapsoriasis en plaques") are skin lesions {{that may be}} {{included}} in the modern scheme of cutaneous conditions described as parapsoriasis. These lesions, called plaques, may be irregularly round-shaped to oval and are 10 cm or larger in diameter. They can be very thin plaques that are symptomatic or mildly pruritic. Large-plaque parapsoriasis is a common associate of retiform parapsoriasis, can be accompanied by <b>poikiloderma</b> vasculare atrophicans, and can in rare occasions be a precursor to cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Poikiloderma</b> of Civatte is a {{cutaneous}} {{condition and}} refers to reticulated red to red-brown patches with telangiectasias. It is identifiable as the reddish brown discoloration on {{sides of the}} neck, usually on both sides. It is more common with women than men and more commonly effects middle-aged to elderly women. [...] "Poikiloderma" [...] is basically a change of the skin due to dilation of the {{blood vessels in the}} neck. [...] "Civatte" [...] was the French dermatologist who first identified it in the 1920s.|$|E
5000|$|In modern {{consideration}} and usage, the solitary term [...] "poikiloderma" [...] has {{also come to}} represent all three elements of PVA. When skin diseases and disorders or skin conditions described as dermatoses contain the term <b>poikiloderma</b> in their assessment or diagnosis (such as with Bloom syndrome), this can sometimes be an erroneous usage of the term. Discretion has been advised. Usage of the entire term [...] "poikiloderma vasculare atrophicans" [...] may also be reserved to indicate it as the primary condition affecting the skin {{in cases where the}} disorder associated with it is secondary.|$|E
5000|$|PVA {{usually has}} an {{underlying}} cause, attributed to existing skin diseases and disorders {{associated with a}} cutaneous lymphoma or inflammation. Mycosis fungoides is the common lymphoma believed to cause PVA, {{although it may be}} considered a precursor when the lymphoma is [...] (hidden) and undiagnosed. Large plaque parapsoriasis is another common causes of PVA. Less common causes include autoimmune-related connective tissue diseases such as lupus, dermatomyositis and scleroderma. Dermatoses and those that are genetically inspired, called genodermatoses, may also be an underlying cause of PVA. Among them, xeroderma pigmentosum and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (<b>poikiloderma</b> congenita) are thought to be the most prominent. Ingestion of substances containing arsenic, such as arsphenamine, has also been suggested as a least common cause. PVA can also be idiopathic (of unknown cause), as seen in a small number of cases.|$|E
50|$|PVA {{fits within}} this updated view of parapsoriasis as a {{syndrome}} {{often associated with}} large plaque parapsoriasis and, or including its variant form, retiform parapsoriasis. Additionally, it may be considered a precursor or variant of the lymphomatous skin disorder mycosis fungoides, which is also associated with large plaque parapsoriasis. Large plaque parapsoriasis consists of inflamed, oddly discolored (such as yellow or blue), web-patterned and scaling plaques on the skin, 10 cm or larger in diameter. When {{the condition of the}} skin encompassed by these plaques worsens and becomes atrophic, it is typically considered retiform parapsoriasis. PVA can occur in either the large plaque or retiform stage, but it can only be considered PVA when its three constituents (<b>poikiloderma,</b> telangiectasia, atrophy) are present. PVA is therefore considered an independent syndrome identified by its constituents, wherever it occurs.|$|E
50|$|Another topical therapy used {{to treat}} {{psoriasis}} {{is a form of}} balneotherapy, which involves daily baths in the Dead Sea. This is usually done for four weeks with the benefit attributed to sun exposure and specifically UVB light. This is cost-effective and it has been propagated as an effective way to treat psoriasis without medication. Decreases of PASI scores greater than 75% and remission for several months have commonly been observed. Side-effects may be mild such as itchiness, folliculitis, sunburn, <b>poikiloderma,</b> and a theoretical risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer or melanoma has been suggested. However, more recent studies have determined that there {{does not appear to be}} increased risk of melanoma in the long-term. Data are inconclusive with respect to nonmelanoma skin cancer risk, but support the idea that the therapy is associated with an increased risk of benign forms of sun-induced skin damage such as, but not limited to, actinic elastosis or liver spots. Dead Sea balneotherapy is also effective for psoriatic arthritis.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{patient with}} lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia {{presents}} with an extended history of hypereosinophilia and cutaneous allergy-like symptoms. Skin symptoms, which occur in >75% of patients, include erythroderma, pruritis, eczema, <b>Poikiloderma,</b> urticarial, and episodic angioedema. The symptom of episodic angioedema in lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia resembles that occurring in Gleich's syndrome, a rare disease that {{is accompanied by}} secondary hypereosinophilia plus a sub-population of CD3(-), CD4(+) T cells and therefore proposed, at least in many patients, a subtype of lymphocyte-variant hypereosiophilia. Biopsies of these erythroderma and eczema skin lesions find prominent accumulations of eosinophils. Other presentations include; a) lymphadenopathy occurring in ~60% of patients; b) eosinophil infiltrations in lung similar to, and often diagnosed as, eosinophilic pneumonia, occurring in ~20% of patients; c) episodic angioedema-related gastrointestinal symptoms that are sometimes similar to symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome occurring in ~20% of patients; d) rheumatologic manifestations of inflammatory arthralgias in ~20% of patients; and e) splenomegaly occurring in ~10% of patients. Cardiovascular complications such as various types of heart damage (see above History section) and vascular injuries due to eosinophil infiltration and eosinophil-induced thrombosis are often critical components of persistent hypereosinohilia syndromes; These complications are not a prominent component of lymphocyte-variant hypereosionophilia, occurring in <10% of patients.|$|E

40|$|Three {{overlapping}} conditions, namely Rothmund-Thomson (RTS), Baller-Gerold (BGS) and RAPADILINO syndromes, {{have been}} attributed to RECQL 4 mutations. Differential diagnoses depend on the clinical presentation, but the numbers of known genes remain low, leading to the widespread prescription of RECQL 4 sequencing. The aim of our study was therefore to determine the best clinical indicators for the presence of RECQL 4 mutations in a series of 39 patients referred for RECQL 4 molecular analysis and belonging to the RTS (27 cases) and BGS (12 cases) spectrum. One or two deleterious RECQL 4 mutations were found in 10 / 27 patients referred for RTS diagnosis. Clinical and molecular reevaluation led to a different diagnosis in 7 / 17 negative cases, including Clericuzio-type <b>poikiloderma</b> with neutropenia, hereditary sclerosing <b>poikiloderma,</b> and craniosynostosis/anal anomalies/porokeratosis.

40|$|Rothmund-Thomson {{syndrome}} (RTS) is a genodermatosis presenting with {{a characteristic}} facial rash (<b>poikiloderma)</b> associated with short stature, sparse scalp hair, sparse or absent eyelashes and/or eyebrows, juvenile cataracts, skeletal abnormalities, radial ray defects, premature aging and a predisposition to cancer. The prevalence is unknown but around 300 {{cases have been}} reported in the literature so far. The diagnostic hallmark is facial erythema, which spreads to the extremities but spares the trunk, and which manifests itself within the first year and then develops into <b>poikiloderma.</b> Two clinical subforms of RTS have been defined: RTSI characterised by <b>poikiloderma,</b> ectodermal dysplasia and juvenile cataracts, and RTSII characterised by <b>poikiloderma,</b> congenital bone defects and an increased risk of osteosarcoma in childhood and skin cancer later in life.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pulsed {{dye laser}} (PDL) {{treatment}} {{is widely used}} for <b>poikiloderma</b> of Civatte. Some adverse events in small numbers of patients have been reported. Guidelines for treatment of <b>poikiloderma</b> of Civatte do not exist. OBJECTIVE: To report the occurrence of persistent depigmentation as a late adverse event {{in a series of}} patients with <b>poikiloderma</b> of Civatte after treatment with PDL. METHODS: Eight patients (seven women and one man, mean age 48 years) with <b>poikiloderma</b> of Civatte were treated with PDL using a 585 -nm wavelength and a fixed pulse duration of 450 micros. In all patients one or two test PDL patches were performed and reviewed after 3 months. All of the patients tolerated the testing without complications. Subsequent treatments were undertaken at intervals of 3 months. RESULTS: All patients were treated with fluences between 3. 5 and 7 J/cm 2, using a 7 - or 10 -mm spot size. All patients had a good result with respect to clearing of the vascular component. Nevertheless, six of them, treated with 5 - 7 J/cm 2, reported severe depigmentation 4 - 11 months after treatment. Two patients treated with lower fluences (3. 5 - 5. 5 J/cm 2) did not report this depigmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Great care is needed when PDL treatment is used for <b>poikiloderma</b> of Civatte. Pigment changes have been incidentally mentioned as late complications but have not been well documented as the late depigmentation has been in this series. It is advisable to use fluences as low as possible, and not exceeding an upper limit of 5 J/cm 2, on a 10 -mm spot size. More research is needed to define an optimal pulse duratio...|$|E
