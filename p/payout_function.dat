50|$|Parametric Index: Many {{firms are}} uncomfortable with pure {{parametric}} bonds {{due to the lack}} of correlation with actual loss. For instance, a bond may pay out based on the wind speed at 50 of the 150 stations mentioned above, but the insurer loses very little money because a majority of their exposure is concentrated in other locations. Models can give an approximation of loss as a function of the speed at differing locations, which are then used to give a <b>payout</b> <b>function</b> for the bond. These function as hybrid Parametric / Modeled loss bonds, and have lowered basis risk as well as more transparency.|$|E
5000|$|In Black-Scholes pricing of options, omitting {{interest}} rates and the first derivative, the Black-Scholes equation reduces to [...] "(infinitesimally) the time value is the convexity". That is, {{the value of an}} option is due to the convexity of the ultimate payout: one has the option to buy an asset or not (in a call; for a put it is an option to sell), and the ultimate <b>payout</b> <b>function</b> (a hockey stick shape) is convex - [...] "optionality" [...] corresponds to convexity in the payout. Thus, if one purchases a call option, the expected value of the option is higher than simply taking the expected future value of the underlying and inputting it into the option payout function: the expected value of a convex function is higher than the function of the expected value (Jensen inequality). The price of the option - the value of the optionality - thus reflects the convexity of the payoff function.|$|E

As provided by local and state law, there scattered areas where smoking is permitted, totaling 25% of the official gaming space. (Aside from this exception, smoking is banned by law {{throughout the rest of}} the casino and hotel). Under New Jersey law, persons under 21 years of age are not permitted to gamble. They may only pass through the main aisles of the casino when accompanied by someone over 21 years old to cross between hotel areas and exits, and may not stop or slow down to observe the games.|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to current donor policy, which funds a recipient country’s national AIDS control program, this paper proposes a measurement strategy to enable a donor to reward a recipient country’s success at HIV prevention, {{irrespective of the}} inputs, activities, or who gets the credit. In accordance with the “cash-on-delivery” model of foreign assistance, the objective is not to replace traditional input- or activity-oriented aid, but to complement it by enhancing the motivation for local actors and their partners (including the traditional bilateral and multilateral funding agencies and their agents) to achieve measurable reductions {{in the rate of}} new HIV infections. This paper proposes two approaches to measuring the number of HIV infections averted between a baseline survey and a follow-up survey and explores the properties of ten alternative “payout functions” which would link measured epidemic changes {{to the size of the}} reward to be paid. All measurement approaches include the possibility of statistical error and thus a risk of rewarding the country too little or too much. This risk depends on the initial rate of infection and on HIV prevention success and can be reduced by either increasing the survey sample size or increasing the interval between surveys. By negotiating in advance the choice of one of these measurement approaches and one of a menu of <b>payout</b> <b>functions,</b> the donor and recipient agree on the recipient’s incentive structure with respect to the magnitude and precision of the estimated reduction in the rate of new infection.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple {{homogeneous}} dynamic model of investment and corporate risk management for a financially constrained firm. Following Froot, Scharfstein, and Stein (1993), we define a corporation’s risk management as {{the coordination of}} investment and financing decisions. In our model, corporate risk management involves internal liquidity management, financial hedging, and investment. We determine a firm’s optimal cash, investment, asset sales, credit line, external equity finance, and <b>payout</b> policies as <b>functions</b> of the following key param-eters: 1) the firm’s earnings growth and cash-flow risk; 2) the external cost of financing; 3) the firm’s liquidation value; 4) the opportunity cost of holding cash; 5) investment adjustment and asset sales costs; and 6) the return and covariance characteristics of hedging assets the firm can invest in. The optimal cash inventory policy {{takes the form of}} a double-barrier policy where i) cash is paid out to shareholders only when the cash-capital ratio hits an endogenous upper barrier, and ii) external funds are raised only when the firm has depleted its cash. In between the two barriers, the firm adjusts its capital expenditures, asset sales, and hedging policies. Several new insights emerge from our analysis. For example, we find an inverse relation between marginal Tobin’s q and investment when the firm draws on its credit line. We also find that financially constrained firms may have a lower equity beta in equilibrium because these firms tend to hold higher precautionary cash inventories...|$|R
40|$|We {{show how}} {{algorithmic}} differentiation {{can be used}} to efficiently implement the pathwise derivative method for the calculation of option sensitivities using Monte Carlo simulations. The main practical difficulty of the pathwise derivative method is that it requires the differentiation of the <b>payout</b> <b>function.</b> For the type of struc-tured options for which Monte Carlo simulations are usually employed, these derivatives are typically cumbersome to calculate analytically, and too time con-suming to evaluate with standard finite-difference approaches. In this paper we address this problem and show how algorithmic differentiation can be employed to calculate these derivatives very efficiently and with machine-precision accu-racy. We illustrate the basic workings of this computational technique by means of simple examples, and we demonstrate with several numerical tests how the path-wise derivative method combined with algorithmic differentiation – especially in the adjoint mode – can provide speed-ups of several orders of magnitude with respect to standard methods. ...|$|E
40|$|Growing water {{demands and}} more {{frequent}} and severe droughts are increasingly challenging water management in many regions worldwide, exacerbating water disputes and reducing the space for negotiated agreements at the catchment scale. In {{the lack of a}} centralized controller, the design and deployment of coordination and/or regulatory mechanisms is a way to improve system-wide efficiency while preserving the distributed nature of the decision making setting, and facilitating cooperation among institutionally independent decision-makers. Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in index-based insurance contracts as mechanisms for sharing hydro-meteorological risk in complex and heterogeneous decision making context (e. g. multiple stakeholders and institutionally independent decision makers). In this study, we explore the potential for index-based insurance contracts to mitigate the conflict in a water system characterized by (political) power asymmetry between hydropower companies upstream and farmers downstream. The Lake Como basin in the Italian Alps is considered as a case study. We generated alternative regulatory mechanisms in the form of minimum release constraints to the hydropower facilities, and designed an insurance contract for hedging against hydropower relative revenue losses. The fundamental step in designing this type of insurance contracts is the identification of a suitable index, which triggers the payouts as well as the <b>payout</b> <b>function,</b> defined by strike level and slope (e. g., euros/index unit). A portfolio of index-based contracts was designed for the case study and evaluated in terms of revenue floor, basis risk and revenue fluctuation around the mean, both with and without insurance. Over the long term, the insurance proved to be capable to keep the minimum revenue above a specified level while providing a greater certainty on the revenue trend. This result shows the possibility to augment farmer's supply with little loss for hydropower companies, thus helping in mitigating the conflict between the stakeholders...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a generic method for the Monte-Carlo pricing of (generalized) auto-callable {{products}} (aka. trigger products), i. e., products for which the <b>payout</b> <b>function</b> features a discontinuity with a (possibly) stochastic location (the trigger) and value (the payout). The Monte-Carlo pricing of products with discontinuous payout is known to come with a high Monte-Carlo error. The numerical calculation of sensitivities (i. e., partial derivatives) of such prices by finite differences gives very noisy results, since the Monte-Carlo approximation (being a finite sum of discontinuous functions) is not smooth. Additionally, the Monte-Carlo error of the finite-difference approximation explodes as the shift size tends to zero. Our method combines a product specific modification of the underlying numerical scheme, which is to some extent similar to an importance sampling and/or partial proxy simulation scheme and a reformulation of the payoff function into an equivalent smooth payout. From the financial product we merely require that hitting of the stochastic trigger will result in an conditionally analytic value. Many complex derivatives can be written in this form. A class of products where this property is usually encountered are the so called auto-callables, where a trigger hit results in cancellation of all future payments except for one redemption payment, which can be valued analytically, conditionally on the trigger hit. From the model we require that its numerical implementation allows for a calculation of the transition probability of survival (i. e., non-trigger hit). Many models allows this, e. g., Euler schemes of Itô processes, where the trigger is a model primitive. The method presented is effective across a large range of cases where other methods fail, e. g. small finite difference shift sizes or short time to trigger reset (approaching maturity); this means that a practitioner can use this method and be confident that it will work consistently. The method itself {{can be viewed as}} a generalization of the method proposed by Glasserman and Staum (2001), both with respect to the type (and shape) of the boundaries, as well as, with respect to the class of products considered. In addition we explicitly consider the calculation of sensitivities. Monte-Carlo simulation, pricing, greeks, variance reduction, auto-callable, trigger product, target redemption note...|$|E
