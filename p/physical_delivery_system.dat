40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines {{the impact of}} the elimination of 'Facility Not Available' (FNA) waivers. Naval Reserve facilities could previously waive, as 'FNA,' any portion of the periodic physical examination not locally available. The Navy eliminated the authority to use FNA waivers in February 1994. The objective of this thesis was to identify the impact of FNA waiver elimination on periodic physical examination cost, effectiveness and delivery methods. It begins by describing the periodic physical examination and the Naval Reserve <b>physical</b> examination <b>delivery</b> <b>system.</b> Three methodologies were used to do this: interviews of key personnel, a literature review, and analysis of retrospective data from the Naval and Marine Corps Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) and the Commander of the Naval Reserve Force (CNRF). Then the impacts of FNA waiver elimination were examined using a survey which resulted in the review of 81, 699 medical records and periodic <b>physical</b> examination <b>delivery</b> and cost data from 199 Naval Reserve facilities (98 percent of the Naval Reserve). This thesis found that FNA waiver elimination was an extremely successful change in health care policy for the Naval Reserve. Periodic physical examination costs were increased and the methods used to deliver examinations were changed. However, these impacts are justified because of the dramatic increase in periodic physical examination effectiveness achieved due to FNA waiver elimination. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Bleomycin {{is poorly}} {{permeant}} but potent cytotoxic and radiosensitizing drug. The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate whether a <b>physical</b> drug <b>delivery</b> <b>system</b> – electroporation can increase radiosensitising effect of bleomycin in vitro and in vivo. Methods LPB sarcoma cells and tumors were treated either with bleomycin, electroporation or ionizing radiation, and combination of these treatments. In vitro, response to different treatments was determined by colony forming assay, while in vivo, treatment effectiveness was determined by local tumor control (TCD 50). Time dependence of partial oxygen pressure in LPB tumors after application of electric pulses was measured by electron paramagnetic oxyimetry. Results Electroporation of cells in vitro increased radiosensitising effect of bleomycin for 1. 5 times, in vivo radiation response of tumors was enhanced by 1. 9 fold compared to response of tumors that were irradiated only. Neither treatment of tumors with bleomycin nor application of electric pulses only, affected radiation response of tumors. Application of electric pulses to the tumors induced profound but transient reduction of tumor oxygenation. Although tumor oxygenation after electroporation partially restored at the time of irradiation, it was still reduced at the level of radiobiologically relevant hypoxia. Conclusion Our study shows that application of electric pulses to cells and tumors increases radiosensitising effect of bleomycin. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the radiobiologically relevant hypoxia induced by electroporation of tumors did not counteract the pronounced radiosensitising effect of electrochemotherapy with bleomycin. </p...|$|R

Optimally designed cancer vaccines should combine the best tumor antigens with the most effective immunotherapy agents and/or delivery strategies to achieve positive clinical results. Various vaccine <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> such as different routes of immunization and physical/chemical delivery methods have been used in cancer therapy with the goal to induce immunity against tumor-associated antigens. Two basic <b>delivery</b> approaches including <b>physical</b> <b>delivery</b> to achieve higher levels of antigen production and formulation with microparticles to target antigen-presenting cells (APCs) have demonstrated to be effective in animal models. New developments in vaccine <b>delivery</b> <b>systems</b> will improve the efficiency of clinical trials in the near future.

40|$|The Nedd for Policy Framework in Maintaining Quality in Open andDistance Education Programmes in Southern AfricaProf. Dele BRAIMOHNational University of LesothoLesotho-SOUTH AFRICA Dr. Rebecca LEKOKOUniversity of BotswanaBostwana-SOUTH AFRICA ABSTRACT The {{ideals of}} {{education}} for all as proposed by UNESCO (2000) cannot be achieved without tapping into all the existing educational <b>delivery</b> <b>systems.</b> Open and distance education system has {{caught the attention of}} a number of Southern African Universities as a viable and ‘Siamese’ twin of the conventional education in achieving flexibility, open and greater access for the heterogeneous clientele of the region. Despite the glowing virtues of distance education, this mode is still looked down upon by some people as inferior to the conventional teaching and learning processes. Paradoxically, learning through the distance education mode has a greater potential to provide education for more learners than the conventional education system. In a dynamic society such as the Southern African region, development has made education a phenomenon that transcends the four walls of the formal classrooms. Thus, a policy framework is needed to ensure that quality education is provided for learners of diverse cultures, including economic background and geographical regions. Such a framework is not only a basic requirement for positive development of the newly emerging distance education institutions but also an essential instrument for the continued success of the long established institutions, both single and dual mode. The proposed policy framework addresses some of the following (i) academic (e. g. course integrity, transferability and accreditation); (ii) governance, (e. g. tuition, fiscal regulation); (iii) faculty (e. g. training, workload, support and evaluation); (iv) legal (e. g. intellectual property, students and institutional liability); (v) technical (e. g. <b>physical</b> <b>delivery</b> networks, <b>systems</b> reliability, setup and infrastructural support); (vi) culture and (vii) economics, (e. g. direct and indirect costs of distance education). All these aspects can deter or stimulate certain group of people to develop interest and consequently enrol for learning through the distance education mode. In this paper, our aim is to stimulate dialogue on the significance, scope of coverage and the processes of formulating a policy framework for maintaining academic excellence as opposed to mediocrity. We are, however, mindful of the fact that practices are diverse in the region, but regardless of this diversity, a regional policy framework is possible to regulate the planning, development and implementation of quality distance education programmes across all levels of education, with particular focus on higher institutions of learning...|$|R
