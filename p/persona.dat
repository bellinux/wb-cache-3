The summoning ritual for Personas in battle varies throughout the series: in early games, the party gains the ability to summon through a short ritual after playing a parlor game; in <b>Persona</b> 3, they fire a gun-like device called an Evoker at their head; in <b>Persona</b> 4, they summon their Personas using Tarot cards; in <b>Persona</b> 5, they are summoned through the characters' masks.|$|E

40|$|In this research, {{we focused}} on {{developing}} <b>personas</b> and scenarios in designing a PC Portal for IPTV solution. We employed <b>personas</b> to consider users and their context of use when designing for the system. Different {{studies have been conducted}} on the subject of using <b>personas</b> and scenarios in design projects. Some of them show that using <b>personas</b> have a positive effect in the outcome of the design in particular contexts. Other studies, however, suggest that designers have difficulties when using <b>personas</b> in their design process. The underlying cause of these problems might refer to shortcomings in construction of suitable <b>personas,</b> or how to use them throughout the design process. We performed a literature review on <b>personas</b> and scenarios, their advantages, and, how to develop them. Then, we developed <b>personas</b> and scenarios for IPTV problem domain and to base our <b>personas</b> on user study results, we used questionnaire survey and interviews to acquire knowledge about the users. We proposed a design solution and developed a prototype based on elaborated <b>personas</b> and scenarios to evaluate our findings. We argued different challenges that we faced while using <b>personas</b> and scenarios. We illustrated how graphical user interfaces can be developed to satisfy multiple <b>personas</b> by providing the users with different representations of the same information. We also argued why the area of personalized television needs more attention from CHI community and why people are becoming more interested in personalized TV viewing experiences. Elaborated <b>personas</b> and scenarios helped us focus more on users and their context. This could not be easily achieved without rendering the raw data from user studies into <b>personas</b> and scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Collaboration <b>personas</b> are a {{tool that}} can be used to design for groups. Prior work posits that {{collaboration}} <b>personas</b> can improve tool adoption by helping designers create collaboration tools that are better targeted to the goals, needs, and interactions between members of collaborative groups. We present a comparative study of design and user experience practitioners who used both collaboration <b>personas</b> and individual <b>personas.</b> Participants conducted a cognitive walkthrough and provided redesign suggestions for a collaboration tool. Our results show that the focus of the cognitive walkthrough and redesign task differed, with collaboration <b>personas</b> showing more group focus. Collaboration <b>personas</b> led to a more complete discussion, as indicated by a greater amount of time spent on the task compared to individual <b>personas.</b> Despite prior experience and training with individual <b>personas,</b> collaboration <b>personas</b> were preferred and better supported the task, since they focused on groups of people and their interactions.

While designing the characters for <b>Persona,</b> Kaneko was inspired by multiple notable celebrities and fictional characters of the time, along with members of Atlus staff. In <b>Persona</b> and Innocent Sin, the main characters all wore the same school uniforms, so Kaneko differentiated them using accessories. For Eternal Punishment, the main cast were adults, so Kaneko needed to rethink his design procedure. Eventually, he adopted the concept of ordinary adults, and gave them designs that would stand out in-game.|$|E

The study had several limitations: outcomes were assessed by a professor and students who were not blind to the hypothesis, students were assigned to groups in a non-random fashion, the findings were not replicated, and other contributing factors or expectation effects (e.g., the Hawthorne effect or Pygmalion effect) were not controlled for.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Personas</b> {{are useful}} for obtaining an empirically {{grounded}} understanding of a secure system’s user population, its contexts of use, and possible vulnerabilities and threats endangering it.

Assumption <b>Personas</b> have been proposed as boundary objects for articulating assumptions about a user population, but no methods or tools currently exist for developing and refining these within the context of secure and usable design. This paper presents an approach for developing and refining as-sumption <b>personas</b> before and during the design of secure systems. We present a model for structuring the contribution of assumptions to as-sumption <b>personas,</b> together with a process for developing assumption <b>personas</b> founded on this model.

In Europe, the series did not become established prior to the release of <b>Persona</b> 3 and 4, both of which were highly successful in the region. According to Atlus CEO Naoto Hiraoka, the main turning point for the franchise was the release of <b>Persona</b> 3, which was a commercial success and brought the series {{to the attention of the}} mainstream gaming community. <b>Persona</b> 4 received an even better reception.

In the Velvet Room, the player can summon a new <b>Persona</b> that belongs to a spell card's particular <b>Persona</b> family group. As a character gains experience levels, more powerful Personas from a spell card's group become available.
