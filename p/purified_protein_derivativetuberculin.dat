40|$|A <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative-live {{preparation}} of Brucella abortus strain 45 / 20 was tested for immunogenic properties either alone, after lipid conjugation, or {{in association with}} defined adjuvants. The adjuvants were trehalose dimycolate (cord factor), isolated from wax D of mycobacteria and murmyl dipeptide (N-acetyl-muramyl-L-alamyl-D-isoglutamine), a synthetic glycopeptide analog of peptidoglycan subunits found in many bacterial cell walls and wax D of mycobacteria. Guinea pigs were intradermally inoculated with a single injection of the vaccine preparations eight weeks before intramuscular challenge with B. abortus, strain 2308. None of the <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative-like preparations were as effective {{in the prevention of}} splenic infections with B. abortus as were killed whole cells of strain 45 / 20 in Freund's complete adjuvant.

40|$|Background: Current {{therapeutic}} modalities for viral warts {{are mostly}} ablative and {{are limited by}} high recurrence rates besides being unsuitable for numerous lesions. Immunotherapy {{has the potential to}} overcome these limitations. Aims: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effectiveness and safety of Bacillus Calmette–Guerin vaccine versus tuberculin <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative in the immunotherapy of warts. Methods: Patients received three doses of 0. 1 ml of Bacillus Calmette–Guerin vaccine or tuberculin <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative intradermally over the deltoid region at 4 -weekly intervals. They were followed-up for another month. Number of warts, complete cure rates and quality of life were assessed. Results: A total of 60 patients were included. Complete clearance was noted in 16 (48. 5 %) out of 33 patients in the Bacillus Calmette–Guerin group and in 5 (18. 5 %) out of 27 in the tuberculin <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative group (P = 0. 121). The number of lesions reduced statistically significantly from baseline in both the groups (P < 0. 001) from the first follow-up visit onward (P < 0. 05). The reduction was statistically significantly more in the Bacillus Calmette–Guerin group than in the tuberculin <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative group from the second follow-up onward. Dermatologic life quality index improved statistically significantly with both treatments. Adverse events (pain during injection, abscess formation and scarring at injection site) were more frequent with Bacillus Calmette–Guerin. No recurrence was seen after lesions cleared. Limitations: Patients were not followed up for more than 4 weeks after treatment. We could not estimate the cytokine levels or the peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation in response to Bacillus Calmette–Guerin/tuberculin <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative injections. Conclusion: Both intradermal Bacillus Calmette–Guerin and tuberculin <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative hold promise in the treatment of viral warts. Bacillus Calmette–Guerin may be more effective, though it had more adverse events in our study...|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{cellular}} functions {{occur in}} spatially and temporally confined regions.

40|$|Mononuclear {{cells in}} pleural fluid from {{patients}} with tuberculous pleurisy were predominantly T cells. Responsiveness of pleural fluid T cells to <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative of tuberculin were studied by the assay of cell proliferation {{and production of}} lymphocyte mitogenic factor by the stimulation with <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were also studied from patients and tuberculin-positive healthy controls. The order of responsiveness was as follows: pleural fluid lymphocytes greater than peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients without effusion = peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy controls greater than peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with effusion. The poor response of peripheral blood lymphocytes from pleurisy patients were recovered by the elimination of adherent cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes {{to the level of}} the response of peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy controls. T cells purified from pleural fluid mononuclear cells responded more than those from peripheral blood. These results suggested that in the pleurisy patients <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative-reactive T cells in peripheral blood did not decrease in activity, but were depressed by suppressor cells, and further suggested that highly <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative-reactive T cells were accumulated in the pleural fluid...|$|R

The antitumor effect of the partially <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> and LMWH were assessed by estimating serum transforming growth factor (TGF-β 1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Also, tumor volume, median survival time (MST), and total lipids, DNA and RNA in liver tissues, liver function tests and the redox status were estimated. Serum TGF-β 1 & VEGF levels were highly significantly increased (p <  0. 005) in the tumorized mice compared to control group and restored to their normal levels after treatment with LMWH and the <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> (p <  0. 005). Also, the erythrocytes content of glutathione (GSH) were showed to be highly significantly decreased (p <  0. 005) in tumorized groups compared to control groups and significantly increased after treatment with LMWH and the <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> (p <  0. 05). In tumorized mice, the median survival time (MST) was 12. 25  ±  2. 5 days, while, MST of tumorized mice treated with the purified enzyme and LMWH were 19. 00  ±  4. 69 and 15. 75  ±  4. 11 days {{and the increase in}} life span percent were 155. 1 % and 128. 6 % respectively.

Two multiepitopic peptides from ESAT- 6 protein were selected by computational analysis. Patients with active TB (7 HIV + and 20 HIV –) and control patients (17 HIV + and 28 HIV –) were enrolled.

By contrast, latently infected individuals did respond in vitro to both intact ESAT- 6 <b>protein</b> and <b>purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative.

We conducted a cross-sectional screening study on 1314 persons admitted to an opiate detoxification unit in an urban jail. <b>Purified</b> <b>protein</b> derivative tuberculin reactivity and the prevalence of abnormalities consistent with tuberculosis on screening chest x-rays were evaluated.
