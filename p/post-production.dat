5|$|Clooney {{commented that}} <b>post-production</b> for Confessions was {{stressful}} {{because he was}} simultaneously acting in Solaris (2002).|$|E
5|$|During <b>post-production</b> Welles {{and special}} effects artist Linwood G. Dunn experimented with an optical printer to improve certain scenes that Welles found {{unsatisfactory}} from the footage. Whereas Welles was often immediately pleased with Wise's work, he would require Dunn and <b>post-production</b> audio engineer James G. Stewart to re-do their work several times {{until he was}} satisfied.|$|E
5|$|More than 15 {{minutes of}} footage was deleted during <b>post-production</b> of Unbreakable. These scenes are {{available}} on the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|After {{production}} finished on The Terminator, some <b>post-production</b> {{shots were}} needed. These included scenes showing the Terminator outside Sarah Connor's apartment, Reese being zipped into a body bag, and the Terminator's head being crushed in a press.|$|E
5|$|Despite precautions, the <b>post-production</b> faced {{significant}} delays {{owing to}} the digital inter-mediation, increased work-load due to the 3-D and dubbed versions of the film, and delays in {{the completion of the}} visual effects. The <b>post-production</b> also faced budget constraints and witnessed an overuse of CGI according to the cinematographer. The delays left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release. Khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress of work, and postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time.|$|E
5|$|In <b>post-production,</b> Embassy's self-imposed role {{in making}} Crimewave was even greater. Although Raimi, Tapert, and Campbell {{insisted that they}} had made the film as partners, the studio refused — because of the already {{ballooning}} costs — to pay for Campbell to stay in Los Angeles during <b>post-production</b> (although the executives later compromised). The studio replaced Raimi's music composer, Joseph LoDuca, with {{one of its own}} choosing. It did the same with the editor, removing Raimi's influence over the film's final cut.|$|E
5|$|In <b>post-production,</b> {{the visual}} effects were handled by Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs. The {{military}} aircraft they created was so realistic that the Indian Air Force called {{to check the}} producer's permission of using an actual MiG-21.|$|E
5|$|On April 2011, Stone {{revealed}} that the cinematography had wrapped and that <b>post-production</b> began in May although some reshooting took place in New York City in November 2011 and in Los Angeles in December 2011.|$|E
5|$|Other filming {{locations}} included Hong Kong and New Orleans, and filming {{was completed}} by December 25, 2011. On February 9, 2012, {{it was reported that}} The Expendables 2 was in <b>post-production.</b>|$|E
5|$|Planet Terror makes {{heavy use}} of digital effects {{throughout}} the film. Perhaps {{the most notable}} effect is Cherry's (Rose McGowan) fake leg. To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during <b>post-production</b> the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots {{and replaced it with}} computer-generated props—first a table leg and then an M16 rifle. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during <b>post-production.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Post-production</b> {{phase was}} {{scheduled}} to be wrapped up in 50 days. On 19 May 2014, a puja commemorated the beginning of the film's dubbing at Hyderabad. The supporting cast of the film completed dubbing for their parts in late August 2014, and Mahesh began dubbing for his role after returning from Europe. The dubbing was completed on 10 September 2014. Aagadu was passed with an 'U/A' certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification in mid September 2014. All the remaining <b>post-production</b> activities, including the final mixing, were wrapped up by 16 September 2014.|$|E
5|$|<b>Post-production</b> {{took place}} in Los Angeles. Composer/co-lyricist Shaiman {{continued}} work on the film's music, employing the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra to record instrumentation for both the songs and the incidental score.|$|E
5|$|<b>Post-production</b> {{work was}} handled mostly by Framestore CFC, {{who had worked}} on {{previous}} Guinness campaigns Surfer and Dreamer, and had worked with Daniel Kleinman {{on a number of}} outside projects, including several commercials and James Bond title sequences. The project was overseen by William Bartlett, known for his visual effects work on the BBC television documentary Walking with Dinosaurs. The original schedule allowed {{for three and a half}} months in <b>post-production,</b> with airing of the commercial to follow almost immediately.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{what was}} our film Chandler, let's give credit where credit is due. We sadly {{acknowledge}} that all editing, <b>post-production</b> {{as well as}} additional scenes were executed by James T. Aubrey Jr. We are sorry.|$|E
5|$|The TV series {{used the}} Horrible Histories brand, logo and {{associated}} trademarks under licence from publisher Scholastic Books. It was produced for the BBC by LionTV and Citrus Television, with <b>post-production</b> being handled by Platform Post Production. Under series producer Norris and directors Brigstocke, Steve Connelly and Chloe Thomas, each series of thirteen episodes took approximately {{one year to}} produce. The process included several months of research into the historical facts, {{two to three months}} of writing, eight weeks of filming both on location and at London's Twickenham Studios, and three to four months of <b>post-production.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>post-production</b> {{schedule}} for Up in the Air was shorter than Jason Reitman's previous two films. The editing team had only 16 to 17 weeks post-schedule, whereas an editing deadline is usually from 22 to 26 weeks. Reitman {{was involved in}} <b>post-production</b> while shooting. The film was shot entirely on location and Glauberman stayed in Los Angeles to cut. She would send him scenes every day or every other day as she finished them, and he would view them. He flew home every weekend {{to work with her}} for a few hours on Saturday or Sunday in order to stay on schedule.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} three hours and 15 minutes of footage were shot before editing, where it was brought down to 130 minutes (119 without the credits), marking the longest {{stand-alone}} Iron Man film. <b>Post-production</b> also had a 3D conversion and a digital remaster for the IMAX release. Todd-AO mixed the sound in Dolby Atmos to enhance the immersive experience.|$|E
5|$|As {{the film}} was budgeted for two weeks of <b>post-production</b> photography, late 1976 saw three {{separate}} shoots for the final segment, but only some of this material was used. The narration that ends the film, featuring the joke about 'we all need the eggs', was conceived and recorded only two hours before a test screening.|$|E
5|$|Despite a rushed <b>post-production</b> schedule, Universal was so {{impressed}} with Jackson's rough cut on The Frighteners, the studio moved the theatrical release date closer by four months. The film was not a box office success, but received generally positive reviews from critics. Despite its lackluster performance at the box office, the film has gained a cult following in more recent years.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{picketing}} on {{most days}} with his fellow Lost writers, Carlton Cuse, {{a member of the}} WGA negotiating committee, continued to oversee <b>post-production</b> in late November. When negotiations between the Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers broke down in early December, he boycotted his producing duties on the show until the strike was resolved.|$|E
5|$|Horner {{stated that}} {{tensions}} {{between himself and}} Cameron were so high during <b>post-production</b> that he assumed they would never work together again. Horner believed that Cameron's film schedules were too short and stressful. The two parted ways until 1997 when Cameron, impressed with Horner's score for Braveheart, asked him to compose the score for Titanic.|$|E
5|$|However, Julia {{had long}} indulged in a self-destructive {{lifestyle}} of excessive drug consumption, {{and it had}} begun to affect her work. François Truffaut, one of French cinema's most iconic directors and a star of Close Encounters, blamed her for that film's budget difficulties, and she was eventually fired during <b>post-production</b> because of her cocaine dependence.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Irwin {{provided}} {{his voice}} for the 2006 animated film Happy Feet, as an elephant seal named Trev. The film was dedicated to Irwin, as he died during <b>post-production.</b> Another, previously incomplete scene, featuring Irwin providing the voice of an albatross and essentially playing himself, was restored to the DVD release.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, Sony {{delayed the}} film's release from October 10 to December 25, 2014. Sony made <b>post-production</b> {{alterations}} {{to the film}} to modify its portrayal of North Korea, including modifying the designs of buttons worn by characters, originally modeled after real North Korean military buttons praising the country's leaders, and cutting a portion of Kim Jong-un's death scene.|$|E
5|$|In early 2009, {{before the}} release of , Summit {{confirmed}} that they would begin production on The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. Since Weitz would be in <b>post-production</b> for New Moon when The Twilight Saga: Eclipse began shooting, {{he would not be}} directing the third film. Instead, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse was helmed by director David Slade, with Melissa Rosenberg returning as screenwriter. Filming began on August 17, 2009 at Vancouver Film Studios and finished in late October, with <b>post-production</b> beginning early the following month. In April 2010, it was revealed that re-shoots of the film were needed. Slade, who previously said he would not be around for them, was seen, along with Stephenie Meyer, on set. The three main stars were also present.|$|E
5|$|In <b>post-production,</b> Universal {{decided to}} film a new scene for the ending that would feature a reunion between Stiller and Murphy's characters. Murphy, however, refused to return unless he were paid a further $500,000 {{on top of}} his $7.5million salary. The studio {{declined}} to pay the additional money and the scene was not shot.|$|E
5|$|Loham was {{initially}} {{scheduled to be}} released in July 2015 during Ramadan, but it had to be postponed until 20 August because of delays in <b>post-production.</b> The film was then scheduled to open in India on 20 August 2015 as a festival release during the Onam season.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable {{effort was made to}} bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in <b>post-production.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} customers {{at a local}} gas station whenever he saw somebody that looked like they fit one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the creature was left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel {{into the trunk of}} his car and drove to Los Angeles seeking <b>post-production</b> services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small <b>post-production</b> company and agreed to work on the film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E
5|$|Prime Focus World {{converted}} the film into 3D in <b>post-production</b> {{using the same}} tools for the stereoscopy as in World War Z and Gravity. The company made use of scans of the cast's faces from film production while vendor Nvizible helped the company convert the hologram table used by Dr. Carter.|$|E
5|$|The Moving Picture Company {{created the}} climactic hotel sequence. The fire effects were {{supervised}} by Chris Corbould, and <b>post-production</b> MPC had {{to enhance the}} sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it would look more dangerous. A full-scale replica of the building's exterior {{was used for the}} exploding part Bond and Camille escape from.|$|E
5|$|The effects crew {{focused on}} using in-camera tricks {{to realize the}} probe; <b>post-production</b> effects were time-consuming, so {{lighting}} effects were done on stage while filming. Model shop supervisor Jeff Mann filled the probe's antenna with tube lamps and halogen bulbs that were turned on in sequence for different exposures; three different camera passes for each exposure were combined for the final effect. After watching the first shot, the team found the original, whalelike probe design lacking in menace. The modelmakers repainted the probe a shiny black, pockmarked its surface for greater texture and interest, and re-shot the scene. Although they wanted to avoid <b>post-production</b> effects work, the opticals team had to recolor the antenna ball in a blue hue, as the original orange looked too much like a spinning basketball.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} written and {{directed}} by Singaporean filmmaker Jack Neo, and produced by Mediacorp Raintree Pictures. It stars Shawn Lee, Megan Zheng, Xiang Yun and Huang Wenyong. Filming took place in the rural outskirts of Kuala Lumpur during November and December 2002, but <b>post-production</b> delays pushed back the film's release date.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{shooting}} {{reached its}} final stages at Hyderabad in late May 2014, and the <b>post-production</b> phase began. A {{statement from the}} film's unit on 8 June 2014 stated that the principal photography had been wrapped up and post production work was under way, targeting a July 2014 release.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dave starts listing to Hurley why the island events are {{occurring}} in his mind suffered from continuous interruption, as military exercises on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam led to many takes being ruined by plane noises. Weather problems also plagued production, with loud waves causing Hurley's and Libby's beach scene to be redubbed in <b>post-production,</b> and rain on one day changing {{the location of the}} basketball game scene to an indoor court, and also leading to a second day of filming on the cliff. The cliff was digitally redesigned in <b>post-production</b> to appear as if the actors were standing on the edge. Dave's jump was done by making a stunt double jump in front of a bluescreen, with the body hitting the water and resulting splash being rendered through computer graphics. The mental hospital was shot at the Laniakea YWCA in Honolulu, except for Dr. Brooks's office, which was done inside a studio.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Sarah {{encounters}} the Fire Gang {{had to be}} altered in <b>post-production</b> {{as it had been}} filmed against black velvet cloth, to disguise the puppeteers, and a new forest background was added behind. Jim Henson was unhappy with the compositing of the finished scene, although he considered the puppetry featured in it worthy of inclusion.|$|E
