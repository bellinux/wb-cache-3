Magnetism exists both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> macroworld and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> microworld. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> microworld magnetism manifests itself as intrinsic magnetism of {{any and all}} microobjects. Microworld objects consist of neutrons, protons and electrons. Self-magnetic fields of these microobjects are not central. That is why they are described by magnetic moment vectors μn, μр and μе.

5|$|Cleared of any {{responsibility}} for McKay's death, Byrne collected his £200 prize money, {{and as the}} winner {{earned the right to}} fight the English heavyweight champion Jem Ward. The fight was originally scheduled to take place at Leicester on 10 March 1829, but at the last minute Ward claimed that he was unfit and too ill to fight, much to the disapproval of his backers and friends. Rumours circulated that Ward had refused to enter the ring unless he received a prize money of £250 plus an additional £250 if he lost; the event became known in some quarters as the Leicester Hoax. Ward did not fight again for two years, but he and Byrne finally met on 12 July 1831 at Willeycott, near Stratford upon Avon. Each fighter was paid £200. Although Ward was the older man he <b>prevailed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contest after one hour and seventeen minutes, when Byrne's seconds, Tom Spring and Tom Reynolds, withdrew their man in the 33rd round.|$|E

In 1256–58, he {{became involved in the}} War of the Euboeote Succession, at first as a lieutenant of his uncle, Prince William II of Villehardouin, leading an army that laid waste to Euboea and recovered the town of Negroponte for the Prince. Later, however, he sided with his father-in-law Guy de la Roche and the other Frankish lords who opposed William's hegemonic ambitions. William however <b>prevailed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Karydi in 1258, and a parliament was assembled at Nikli to judge the defeated lords. Geoffrey was pardoned by the Prince and his confiscated lands returned, but this time as a personal grant, rather than a fief held in right of conquest.|$|E

His first four-year term was characterized by the Council Wars, a period of political conflict with the mostly white aldermanic majority in City Council. Seven Washington-backed aldermanic challengers <b>prevailed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> April, 1986 special municipal election, facilitating progress with Washington's agenda. Washington died suddenly {{of a heart attack in}} his office. His death was followed by a period of mourning by Chicagoans, particularly in the African-American community.|$|E

In the 1960s, the ACLU, in response to member insistence, turned its attention to in-class promotion of religion. In 1960, 42 percent of American schools included Bible reading. In 1962, the ACLU published a policy statement condemning in-school prayers, observation of religious holidays, and Bible reading. The Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's position, when it prohibited New York's in-school prayers in the 1962 Engel v. Vitale decision. Religious factions across the country rebelled against the anti-prayer decisions, leading them to propose the School Prayer Constitutional Amendment, which declared in-school prayer legal. The ACLU participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment, and the 1966 congressional vote on the amendment failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority.|$|E

On December 14, 1840, Letcher wrote Crittenden {{to tell him that}} the General Assembly would shortly re-elect him to his Senate seat. If he (Crittenden) were going to accept a position in President Harrison's cabinet, Letcher would prefer he do it before March 4, 1841 so the General Assembly would still be in session to elect Crittenden's replacement in the Senate. On January 11, 1841, Crittenden replied that he expected to be named attorney general and believed he could accept the post before Letcher's preferred deadline. However, due to Harrison's death only a month after his inauguration, Crittenden was not able to keep Letcher's timeline; he was appointed attorney general by John Tyler on March 5, 1841.|$|E

Although Norton <b>prevailed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower courts, the case reached the Supreme Court of California, which ruled against Norton. Later, the Lucas Turner and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North Beach to pay Norton's debt. He filed for bankruptcy and by 1858 was living in reduced circumstances at a working class boarding house.|$|E

For the most part, Zahir respected the socio-political system that <b>prevailed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region he ruled. The alliances between him and local notables were bolstered by a network of marriages between the influential families of the area, including Zahir's Zaydani clan. Zahir's own marriages were politically advantageous as they allowed him to consecrate his rule over certain areas or his relationships with certain Bedouin tribes, local clans or urban notables. Zahir had five wives during his lifetime. Among his wives was a woman from the Sardiyah, a Bedouin tribe active in Transjordan and Palestine. Zahir was also married to a daughter of Sayyid Muhammad, a wealthy religious notable from Damascus, a daughter of the mukhtar (headman) of Bi'ina, and a daughter of the mukhtar of Deir al-Qassi.|$|E
5|$|A general {{lawlessness}} <b>prevailed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vast Texas frontier, and Mexico's civic laws went largely unenforced {{among the}} Anglo-American settlers. In particular, the prohibitions against slavery and forced labor were ignored. The requirement that all settlers be Catholic or convert to Catholicism was also subverted. Mexican authorities, perceiving {{that they were}} losing control over Texas and alarmed by the unsuccessful Fredonian Rebellion of 1826, abandoned the policy of benign rule. New restrictions were imposed in 1829–1830, outlawing slavery throughout the nation and terminating further American immigration to Texas. Military occupation followed, sparking local uprisings and a civil war. Texas conventions in 1832 and 1833 submitted petitions for redress of grievances to overturn the restrictions, with limited success. In 1835, an army under Mexican President Santa Anna entered its territory of Texas and abolished self-government. Texans responded by declaring their independence from Mexico on March 2, 1836. On April 20–21, rebel forces under Texas General Sam Houston defeated the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto. In June 1836, Santa Anna agreed to Texas independence, but the Mexican government refused to honor Santa Anna's pledge. Texans, now de facto independent, recognized that their security and prosperity could never be achieved while Mexico denied the legitimacy of their revolution.|$|E
