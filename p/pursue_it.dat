5|$|After {{finishing}} primary education, Morales {{attended the}} Agrarian Humanistic Technical Institute of Orinoca (ITAHO), completing {{all but the}} final year. His parents then sent him to study for a degree in Oruro; although he did poorly academically, he finished all of his courses and exams by 1977, earning money on the side as a brick-maker, day labourer, baker and a trumpet player for the Royal Imperial Band. The latter position allowed him to travel across Bolivia. At {{the end of his}} higher education he failed to collect his degree certificate. Although interested in studying journalism, he did not <b>pursue</b> <b>it</b> as a profession.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, matches at heavily {{attended}} grounds {{were initially}} prohibited {{due to the}} fear of aerial bombing by the Luftwaffe. Scottish national league and cup competitions were suspended {{for the duration of}} the war, but regional league and cup competitions were established in their place. Attendance was initially restricted to 50 percent of capacity; therefore, when 75,000 attended a wartime cup final in May 1940, it was the maximum permitted. The Parashots, a forerunner of the Home Guard, set up a command post at Lesser Hampden in 1940. A government official presented an order demanding that both the Hampden and Lesser Hampden pitches be ploughed and used to plant vegetables, but the Queen's Park committee chose to ignore the order and the government did not <b>pursue</b> <b>it.</b> Wartime internationals were played at Hampden, and 91,000 saw Scotland beat England 5–4 on 18 April 1942.|$|E

5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to <b>pursue</b> <b>it</b> further.|$|E
5|$|Kellee Santiago is a Venezuelan-American {{video game}} {{designer}} and producer. She is the co-founder {{and former president}} of thatgamecompany. Santiago was born in Caracas, Venezuela and was raised in Richmond, Virginia, where she played video games from a young age and was encouraged by her software engineer father to experiment with computers. While attending New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, she became active in experimental theater, and intended to <b>pursue</b> <b>it</b> after earning a master's degree in the Interactive Media Program of the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California. While there, however, she became involved in video game design, and produced Cloud, a game developed by Jenova Chen and a student team. Its success sparked her and Chen to found thatgamecompany upon graduating, and she became the president.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} grand Shakespeare edition was {{conceived}} at a dinner at Josiah Boydell’s home in November 1786. The guest list itself is evidence of Boydell’s extensive connections in the artistic world: Benjamin West, painter to King George III; George Romney, a renowned painter; George Nicol, bookseller to the king and painter; William Hayley, a poet; John Hoole, a scholar and translator of Tasso and Aristotle; and Daniel Braithwaite, an engineer. Most sources also list the painter Paul Sandby. Although the initial idea for the edition was probably not Boydell's, {{he was the one}} to seize and <b>pursue</b> <b>it.</b> He wanted to use the edition to facilitate the development of a British school of history painting.|$|E

5|$|In May 2000, Marvel Studios {{attempted}} {{to produce a}} Deadpool film {{as part of a}} distribution deal with Artisan Entertainment. However, by 2004, Marvel was developing the film with New Line Cinema. David S. Goyer was set to write and direct and courted actor Ryan Reynolds for the lead role, but lost interest within months in favor of other projects. 20th Century Fox acquired Deadpool the following year after New Line placed it in turnaround and was considering the spin-off in the development of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, with Reynolds being cast for the role. After the opening weekend success of X-Men Origins: Wolverine in May 2009, Fox lent Deadpool out to writers with Donner acting as a producer. Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick were hired to write the script in January 2010. Robert Rodriguez was sent a draft of the screenplay the following June but did not <b>pursue</b> <b>it,</b> and Adam Berg emerged as a top contender to direct. In April 2011, visual effects specialist Tim Miller was hired to direct. Principal photography began in March 2015 in Vancouver, Canada, and ended in May. The film was released on February 12, 2016, to both critical and commercial success.|$|E
5|$|On DS9, Sisko informs Nog that he {{will not}} give him a {{recommendation}} as he has concerns that it is a scheme. Nog confesses that he wants to do it so that he doesn't turn out like his father Rom (Max Grodénchik), whom he describes as an engineering genius but his culture won't let him <b>pursue</b> <b>it.</b> Sisko, stunned by this confession of a Ferengi having such upstanding ambitions, responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy. Odo is suspicious of Kira's responses and points a phaser at her, demanding to know who she is. Kira and the crystal suddenly morph into the female Founder (Salome Jens), who reveals that she stole the Maquis ship and she was hoping to convince Odo to return to the Dominion. She reveals the location of the real Kira and transports away. Odo finds Kira and tells her of the Founder, but not of his feelings for her.|$|E
5|$|Szilard was {{appointed}} as assistant to von Laue at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1924. In 1927 {{he finished his}} habilitation and became a Privatdozent (private lecturer) in physics. For his habilitation lecture, he produced a second paper on Maxwell's Demon, Über die Entropieverminderung in einem thermodynamischen System bei Eingriffen intelligenter Wesen (On the reduction of entropy in a thermodynamic system by the intervention of intelligent beings), that had actually been written soon after the first. This introduced the thought experiment now called the Szilard engine and became important {{in the history of}} attempts to understand Maxwell's demon. The paper is also the first equation of negative entropy and information. As such, it established Szilard as {{one of the founders of}} information theory, but he did not publish it until 1929, and did not <b>pursue</b> <b>it</b> further. Claude E. Shannon, who took it up in the 1950s, acknowledged Szilard's paper as his starting point.|$|E

5|$|Though uninvolved {{in foreign}} affairs, and {{therefore}} obliged to follow Britain's lead, the colony enthusiastically supported the mother country during the Second World War, symbolically affirming the British {{declaration of war}} before {{any other part of}} the Empire. During the ensuing conflict over 26,100 Southern Rhodesians of all races served in the armed forces, pro rata to white population a higher contribution of manpower than any other British colony or dominion, and more than the UK itself. George VI knighted Huggins in 1941, and, with the war still ongoing, Britain made overtures towards dominion status. Huggins dismissed this, saying it was imperative to win the war first. The idea of dominionship was raised again in 1952, but Salisbury once more did not <b>pursue</b> <b>it,</b> instead following the results of a referendum held early the next April to enter an initially semi-independent Federation with the directly administered British colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.|$|E

He played drums for a short stint in Power Bill, headed by Jody Spence, Millard Powers and Will Owsley. Power Bill was later renamed The Semantics. Folds did not take a creative role in the band.

The Greek fleet was almost overtaken by the Carthaginians, but was saved when night set in, making further pursuit impossible.

25|$|To {{create this}} I–Thou {{relationship}} with God, {{a person has}} {{to be open to}} the idea of such a relationship, but not actively <b>pursue</b> <b>it.</b> The pursuit of such a relation creates qualities associated with It‑ness, and so would prevent an I‑You relation, limiting it to I‑It. Buber claims that if we are open to the I–Thou, God eventually comes to us in response to our welcome. Also, because the God Buber describes is completely devoid of qualities, this I–Thou relationship lasts as long as the individual wills it. When the individual finally returns to the I‑It way of relating, this acts as a barrier to deeper relationship and community.|$|E
