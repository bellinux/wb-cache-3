5|$|Single-parent {{homes in}} America are {{increasingly}} common. With more children being born to unmarried couples and to couples whose marriages subsequently dissolve, more children live {{with just one}} parent.

30|$|More {{importantly}} from {{a political}} perspective, tuition fees did not affect students with lower education backgrounds. We found overall no effects for students whose <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> no tertiary education. While the effects for women whose <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> and have no tertiary education are very similar, tuition fees decreased expenditure for male students whose <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> tertiary education but not for men whose <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> no tertiary education. Concerning the parents’ position in the job, we found more negative effects of tuition fees on expenditure for students whose <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> low position in the job, which {{is driven by the}} effect on women.|$|R

5000|$|... Fucosidosis is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder, {{which means that}} both <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> to have the mutation and {{pass it on to}} the child. When both <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> the mutation, there is a 25% chance of each child having fucosidosis.|$|R
5|$|In {{the rare}} {{situations}} where both parents have an expanded HD gene, the risk increases to 75%, and when either <b>parent</b> <b>has</b> two expanded copies, {{the risk is}} 100% (all children will be affected). Individuals with both genes affected are rare. For some time HD {{was thought to be}} the only disease for which possession of a second mutated gene did not affect symptoms and progression, but it has since been found that it can affect the phenotype and the rate of progression.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a <b>parent</b> <b>has</b> been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E

25|$|Inheritance of {{multiple}} mutations tends to infer more serious disease. For instance, {{the most common}} genotype responsible for HPP occurs when the affected individual inherits an α-spectrin mutation from one parent (i.e. one <b>parent</b> <b>has</b> hereditary elliptocytosis) and the other parent passes on an as-yet-undefined defect that causes the affected individual's cells to preferentially produce the defective α-spectrin rather than normal α-spectrin.|$|E
25|$|Parents {{are very}} {{important}} for the school's continued success. First, there is for all practical purposes mandatory parent participation in class based working groups for concerts, class excursions and other tasks. Parents of each class are assigned to one of six groups for one year at a time, so that by the time the student finishes his or her studies each <b>parent</b> <b>has</b> participated in each of the six working groups.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Several {{articles}} and {{studies have been}} done on extreme <b>parenting.</b> Many authors <b>have</b> found that, to some degree, extreme <b>parenting</b> <b>has</b> a negative effect on children. More and more children are coming from homes that <b>have</b> included extreme <b>parenting</b> styles. These children have grown up to be struggling adults when it comes to academics, peer-to-peer relationships, and employee to employer relationship. Extreme <b>parenting</b> <b>has</b> the potential to destroy the independence, problem-solving, and relationships of the next generation. One area that has been researched most is extreme parents and youth sports. Studies have shown that youth sports have taken on an entirely new meaning than those of the past. This paper will examine the different styles of extreme parenting, how extreme <b>parenting</b> <b>has</b> changed the coach/player/parent relationship, how extreme <b>parenting</b> <b>has</b> changed not only youth sports but other areas such as employment, college professor/student relationsh...|$|R

25|$|As a Utah Supreme Court Justice from 1980 to 1984, Oaks {{authored}} {{opinions on}} a variety of topics. In In Re J. P., a proceeding was instituted on a petition of the Division of Family Services to terminate parental rights of natural mother. Oaks wrote that a <b>parent</b> <b>has</b> a fundamental right protected by the Constitution to sustain his relationship with his child but that a parent can nevertheless be deprived of parental rights upon a showing of unfitness, abandonment, and substantial neglect.|$|E
25|$|Due to a {{deficiency}} of the enzyme diaphorase I (NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase), methemoglobin levels rise {{and the blood}} of met-Hb patients has reduced oxygen-carrying capacity. Instead of being red in color, the arterial blood of met-Hb patients is brown. This results in the skin of Caucasian patients gaining a bluish hue. Hereditary met-Hb {{is caused by a}} recessive gene. If only one <b>parent</b> <b>has</b> this gene, offspring will have normal-hued skin, but if both parents carry the gene, there is a chance the offspring will have blue-hued skin.|$|E
25|$|Sickle-cell {{conditions}} have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance from parents. The types of haemoglobin a person makes {{in the red}} blood cells depend on what haemoglobin genes are inherited from her or his parents. If one <b>parent</b> <b>has</b> sickle-cell anaemia and the other has sickle-cell trait, then the child has a 50% chance of having sickle-cell disease and a 50% chance of having sickle-cell trait. When both parents have sickle-cell trait, a child has a 25% chance of sickle-cell disease, 25% do not carry any sickle-cell alleles, and 50% have the heterozygous condition.|$|E

25|$|A nullity {{order is}} one which annuls a void or {{voidable}} civil partnership. Section 49 of the Act provides that a civil partnership is void on grounds of ineligibility to register, if the parties: disregarded certain requirements as {{to the formation of}} the partnership, where any party is a minor, where any person whose consent is required (e.g. a <b>parent)</b> <b>has</b> forbidden the formation of the partnership and the court has not given its consent. Where a civil partnership is voidable, applications for nullity orders are subject to the bars of time, knowledge of defect and approbation.|$|E
25|$|Mutations (DNA changes) in the RET proto-oncogene, {{located on}} {{chromosome}} 10, {{lead to the}} expression of a mutated receptor tyrosine kinase protein, termed RET (REarranged during Transfection). RET is involved in the regulation of cell growth and development and its germline mutation is responsible for nearly all cases of hereditary or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Its germline mutation may also be responsible for the development of hyperparathyroidism and pheochromocytoma. Hereditary medullary thyroid cancer is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, meaning that each child of an affected <b>parent</b> <b>has</b> a 50% probability of inheriting the mutant RET proto-oncogene from the affected parent. DNA analysis makes it possible to identify children who carry the mutant gene; surgical removal of the thyroid in children who carry the mutant gene is curative if the entire thyroid gland is removed at an early age, before there is spread of the tumor. The parathyroid tumors and pheochromocytomas are removed when they cause clinical symptomatology. Hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2) accounts for approximately 25% of all medullary thyroid carcinomas.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that there is a two to {{threefold}} greater risk of having social phobia if a first-degree relative also has the disorder. This could be due to genetics and/or due to children acquiring social fears and avoidance through processes of observational learning or parental psychosocial education. Studies of identical twins brought up (via adoption) in different families have indicated that, if one twin developed social anxiety disorder, then the other was between 30 percent and 50 percent more likely than average to also develop the disorder. To some extent this 'heritability' may not be specific – for example, studies have found that if a <b>parent</b> <b>has</b> any kind of anxiety disorder or clinical depression, then a child is somewhat more likely to develop an anxiety disorder or social phobia. Studies suggest that parents of those with social anxiety disorder tend to be more socially isolated themselves (Bruch and Heimberg, 1994; Caster et al., 1999), and shyness in adoptive parents is significantly correlated with shyness in adopted children (Daniels and Plomin, 1985).|$|E
