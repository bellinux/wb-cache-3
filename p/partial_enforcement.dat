40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{government}} 2 ̆ 7 s complete failure to enforce a law can nullify that law. But what are the effects of <b>partial</b> <b>enforcement?</b> This Article shows that imperfect enforcement can alter the de facto content of the written law in predictable and beneficial ways. Specifically, in the tax compliance context, even if perfect enforcement were costless, it would not always be socially optimal. When improving the substantive law is infeasible, the enforcement agency can effect beneficial changes in the law by adopting a probabilistic enforcement scheme that varies according to the category of taxpayer and type of transaction. Our model shows that properly 2 ̆ 2 measuring 2 ̆ 2 enforcement in this manner can increase overall social welfare without reducing tax revenues. Unlike case-by-case discretionary enforcement, which often results in costly uncertainty, measured enforcement operates via systemic, published policies that legal actors can respond to predictably. Accordingly, measured enforcement can offer substantial benefits not readily obtained through additional lawmaking or enforcement schemes...|$|E

On the one hand, free-riding on rich countries technology reduces their investment cost in R&D. On the other hand, firm that violates IPR cannot legally export {{in a country that}} enforces them. Moreover freeriders cannot prevent others to copy their own innovation. The analysis predicts that the willingness to enforce IPR is U-shaped in a country GDP: small/poor countries are willing to respect IPR to access advanced economies markets, while large emerging countries are more reluctant to do so because technological transfers from the West boost their production capacity and their domestic markets. Universal enforcement of IPR yields a higher level of innovation and global welfare only if the developing country does not innovate. A <b>partial</b> <b>enforcement</b> of IPR, strict in the north and lax in the south, is socially better if the developing country invests enough in R&D and if its interior market is large. The theoretical predictions of the model are tested with the help of panel data. The empirical analysis supports the theoretical results...|$|E
40|$|Mutual {{trust is}} one of the {{cornerstones}} of cooperation in the field of European Union private international law. Based on this principle the rules on the cross-border recognition and enforcement of judgments in the European Union are still subject to simplification. The step-by-step approach of the implementation of this principle led to the abolition of the exequatur, often accompanied by a <b>partial</b> harmonization of <b>enforcement</b> law to improve and support the smooth working of cross-border enforcement without exequatur. In this regard, it seems that the Member States still want to have control over the ‘import’ of judgments which results in maintaining the ground for non-recognition and the possibility of relying on them in the Member State of enforcement. This article considers the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition in three areas of justice: civil and commercial matters, family law and maintenance. In these areas the European Union legislator has chosen three different approaches for the implementation of this principle...|$|R
40|$|American {{contract}} law includes a duty of good faith and fair dealing {{in the performance}} of every contract. The duty appears, on first reading, to authorize judges to attach sanctions whenever one party to a contract acts unreasonably towards another. But judicial practice very often falls short of such an expansive standard. This article proposes a novel interpretation of the doctrine that accommodates both the rhetoric of good faith and fair dealing and the reality of judicial enforcement. Good faith and fair dealing, the article contends, is an underenforced legal norm. The duty is valid as a legal norm to the fullest extent, even though courts engage only in <b>partial</b> <b>enforcement</b> of that norm. This article is the first to bring the idea of underenforced legal norms into private law, drawing on the extensive literature on underenforced legal norms in constitutional law, and on analogous ideas in corporate law. The article explores the reasons why legislatures and courts might want to announce a duty whose scope extends beyond what the courts enforce. In private law, as elsewhere, the underenforcement idea allows courts to lend their expressive support to the broader norm while avoiding the negative side effects that attempted full enforcement would entail...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the popular {{reaction to the}} implementation of licensing reforms in England and Wales in 2005. It characterises these events as an episode of moral panic and seeks an ideological explanation for this alarmist response. Utilising historical perspectives, the paper draws particular attention to the formative importance of the Nineteenth Century in terms of constructing contemporary public attitudes towards alcohol. This paper draws on existing sociology and social history to highlight an international and chronological pattern which suggests a connection between Victorian temperance movements and ascetic brands of Protestantism. Through a consideration of Max Weber, E. P. Thompson and a variety of primary sources, an interpretive explanation for this pattern is provided. Legal evidence, showing the growth of alcohol regulation and the <b>partial</b> <b>enforcement</b> of temperance codes of behaviour, is then used to illustrate the survival and secularisation of temperance views from the Nineteenth Century onwards. An interpretive analysis of public discourse surrounding licensing reform in 2005 provides empirical support for this argument. Attitudes to alcohol exhibited during this episode were found to bear qualitative similarities to Calvinist-inspired temperance beliefs. The paper argues that ascetic Protestant attitudes to alcohol have achieved a wide currency and now occupy a hegemonic position within secular British society. The public reaction {{to the implementation of}} the Licensing Act 2003 is thus reinterpreted as a moral panic largely constructed by ascetic Protestant beliefs.

40|$|Impartial legal {{enforcement}} {{provided by the}} state is considered necessary for impersonal exchange, implying that the scope of enforcement determines {{the extent of the}} market and hence the division of labor and related efficiency gains. Yet, the development of effective impartial legal systems provided by the state to govern exchange relationships is a rather recent phenomenon. What were, if any, the institutions that enabled impersonal exchange prior to that development? This paper addresses this question by examining the European experience. It utilizes a game theoretic framework and historical analysis to examine the Community Responsibility System (2 ̆ 2 CRS 2 ̆ 2) that enabled exchange characterized by separation between the quid and the quo over time and space that was impersonal, up to one 2 ̆ 7 s community affiliation. The CRS built on self-governed communities, intra-community (<b>partial)</b> <b>enforcement</b> institutions, and non-contractual joint communal liability in inter-community disputes that induced communities to care about their collective reputations. The analysis touches upon issues central to institutions: the optimal size of the legal responsibility unit as a function of different units 2 ̆ 7 ability to identify, monitor, and punish wrongdoers; the endogenous elicitation of impartial justice from partial courts; the role of self-governed organizations that fall between the ways in which we model the state and communities; the complementarities between reputational mechanisms and those relying on coercive power; the importance of the distinction between personal and communal identities; how institutions endogenously determine if agents condition entering an exchange on the revelation of information regarding personal and communal identity or past actions or both; and the importance of overlapping generations 2 ̆ 7 organizations, such as communities, in facilitating inter-organizational impersonal exchange based on reputation despite each individual 2 ̆ 7 s finite life span...|$|E
40|$|Since 1981, {{intensive}} nest relocation {{has been}} used as the primary tool to minimize hatching disorientation by coastal lights in Broward County. It has always been recognized that nest relocation is a highly invasive, undesirable management tool but it was thought to be a necessity because only 5 of the 8 cities have lightning ordinances in place and at least 70 percent of Broward County beaches are brightly illuminated. In 2006, with the <b>partial</b> <b>enforcement</b> of coastal lightning ordinances, this policy was changed by mandate of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission. No enclosed or open beach hatcheries were used and many more nests were left in situ. Preliminary evaluation of the disorientation incident reports from highly developed Fort Lauderdale, Lauderdale by the Sea, and Pompano Beach indicate that the number of disoriented hatchlings ranged between 16, 532 and 19, 255 in 2006. In 2005, estimated range was 7334 to 9400. Accounting for disoriented hatchling tracks that reached the water, the estimated number of missing hatchlings ranged from 13, 020 to 14, 447 in 2006 and from 5, 198 to 6, 382 in 2005. These numbers may be underestimates because hatchling tracks are often indistinct and are easily removed by rain and wind. Of the 45 nests left in situ on the Fort Lauderdale strip, 22 disoriented. Thirteen of these disorientations were inside cages. While the new management procedures {{may have contributed to the}} disorientation loss of about 8000 more hatchlings than in 2005, the new protocol also appear to to have increased live hatchling production rates of relocated nests, possibly due to wider nest spacing and shorter relocation times and transportation distances. Based on comparison of the increases in overall live hatchling production rates of in situ and relocated nests from 2005 to 2006, we estimate that the new relocation protocol may have contributed to a 12 percentage point increase in the production of relocated nests this year. Comparison of the estimated hatchling production of all nests in 2006 with the projected hatchling production if the old procedures had been used, suggests that the new methods may have contributed to the release of an additional 18, 500 hatchlings. This compares favorably with the increased loss estimate above. Further reduction of beachfront lighting, from increased enforcement of lighting ordinances and education, has the potential to greatly reduce hatchling disorientation losses and reduce the need for relocation even further...|$|E
