40|$|The {{occurrence}} of electrolyte disorders as hypocalcemia and/or hyponatremia is an uncommon event in preeclampsia, {{which can be}} the sign of serious situation, with <b>potentially</b> <b>unfavourable</b> <b>consequences</b> for the mother and her foetus. Hyponatremia {{in the setting of}} preeclampsia is an indicator of severity, and requires the understanding of the etiologic mechanisms to initiate an appropriate treatment. Indeed the often-considered fluid restriction is rarely a treatment option for pregnant women. Hypocalcemia is a complication that must be monitored when a treatment with high doses of intravenous magnesium sulphate is introduced. In this context, hypocalcemia must be sought, with the exclusion of other etiologies as vitamin D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism or renal and extrarenal loss of calcium. A replacement therapy, intravenous or oral according to circumstances, should be considered in case of severe or symptomatic hypocalcemia...|$|E

40|$|Soils {{represent}} a considerable {{part of the}} conditionally renewable natural resources. Consequently, rational land use and proper soil management are important elements of sustainability and have special significance in the national economy, environment protection, and even in rural development. The main soil functions are as follows: • reactor, transformer and integrator of the combined influences of other natural resources; • medium for biomass production, primary food-source of the biosphere; • storage of heat, water, plant nutrients and wastes; • high capacity buffer medium, which may prevent or moderate the <b>unfavourable</b> <b>consequences</b> of various stresses; • natural filter and detoxication system; • significant gene reservoir, {{an important element of}} biodiversity; • conservator of natural and human heritages; • basis for constructions. Society has utilized these functions in different ways (rate, method, efficiency) throughout history, depending on the given natural conditions and socio-economic circumstances. In many cases irrational (misguided) management leads to “soil loss”, functional disturbances and environment deterioration. The prevention or reduction of these <b>unfavourable</b> <b>consequences</b> requires permanent care and efficient control of soil processes...|$|R

40|$|Philosophical {{difficulties}} of stakeholder theory – which {{plays an important}} role in CSR and business ethics – are connected first of all with questions of its status and justification. What sense does stakeholder theory have: descriptive, instrumental or normative? And if normative, why then should executives worry about multiple stakeholder demands? It is well known that Freeman, one of the most important authors of stakeholder theory, deliberately disregarded these problems. In philosophical questions he invoked Rorty’s pragmatism, which in his opinion effectively undermined the “positivistic” dichotomy between facts and values, science and ethics, and enabled stakeholder theory to be understood at the same time as both descriptive and normative. The article presents some difficulties connected with this view, focusing on its dubious assumptions and <b>unfavourable</b> <b>consequences.</b> To the assumptions belongs a false dilemma taken from Rorty, which states that knowledge follows either a rule of representation or a rule of solidarity. One of the <b>unfavourable</b> <b>consequences</b> is the conclusion that stakeholder theory may be true only if its followers are able to force the stakeholders to accept its truthfulness. The main thesis of the article says that, as a result of pragmatic justification, stakeholder theory became a sort of arbitrary narration, which is unable to deal with its (empirical) misuses. However, a return to a more traditional view on facts and values enables us to appreciate the descriptive advantages of the theory and to identify difficulties connected with its normative layer. From this point of view, the attempt at a pragmatic interpretation of stakeholder theory was a misunderstanding that should be withdrawn from circulation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} co-operative self-regulation, or co-management, in safety and environmental regulation in the shipping industry. The focus is on Protection and Indemnity (P&I) Clubs in which third-party liabilities of 90 % of the world's fleet (by tonnage) are insured. In theory, this creates a mutual interest amongst shipowners in minimising risk. The paper examines how this mutual interest is translated into individual behaviour, and the institutional challenges involved in maintaining mutuality within and between the Clubs. There follows {{an evaluation of the}} legitimacy of enrolling private interest groups in regulation in which a wide range of actors hold a stake. The paper concludes that P&I Clubs make a modest contribution to safety and environmental regulation, but also have some <b>potentially</b> <b>unfavourable</b> wider social implications.

The prevalence of hypertension is lower in premenopausal women than men, whereas in postmenopausal women it is higher than in men. Mechanisms responsible for the increase in blood pressure are complex and multifactorial, including loss of estrogen, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, modification in renin-angiotensin system spillover and sympathetic activation. In addition, postmenopausal hypertension can be considered an isolated disease, more typical of elderly women, or part of the metabolic syndrome, which is indeed more common in early postmenopausal women. In particular, metabolic syndrome may be considered a <b>potentially</b> <b>unfavourable</b> prognostic factor in hypertensive postmenopausal women, because it seems to worsen the severity of hypertension and reduce the capacity to respond to specific treatments.
