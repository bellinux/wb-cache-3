Combinations that contain high amounts of all the essential amino acids include rice and beans, corn and beans, and hummus and whole-wheat pita.|$|E
25|$|In 1816, François Magendie {{discovered}} that dogs fed only carbohydrates (sugar), fat (olive oil), and water died evidently of starvation, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein {{as an essential}} dietary component. William Prout in 1827 {{was the first person}} to divide foods into carbohydrates, fat, and protein. During the 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Justus von Liebig quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants (animal and <b>plant</b> <b>protein</b> are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds). With a reputation as the leading organic chemist of his day but with no credentials in animal physiology, Liebig grew rich making food extracts like beef bouillon and infant formula that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value. In the 1860s, Claude Bernard {{discovered that}} body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood glucose can be stored as fat or as glycogen.|$|E

A very fast perfusion liquid chromatography method including sensitive and selective intrinsic fluorescence detection was developed for monitoring and quantifying the efficiency of the pre-fractionation and screening for <b>plant</b> <b>proteins.</b> After tryptic digestion of the enriched fraction from manufactured adulterated SMP, numerous peptides originating from the major seed proteins of soy (glycinin, ß-conglycin) and pea (legumin, vicilin) could be identified by MS/MS analysis on a quadrupole time-of-flight MS instrument...|$|R
25|$|Various ethical reasons {{have been}} {{suggested}} for choosing vegetarianism, usually predicated on the interests of non-human animals. In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural taboo, such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as factory farms, or avoid certain meats, such as veal or foie gras. Some people follow vegetarian or vegan diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but {{because of concerns about}} the specific treatment and practises involved in the raising and slaughter of animals, i.e. factory farming and the industrialisation of animal slaughter. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of <b>plant</b> <b>protein.</b>|$|E

40|$|Human {{perception}} of sweetness, behind the felt pleasure, {{is thought to}} play a role as an indicator of energy density of foods. For humans, {{only a small number of}} <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> taste sweet. As non-caloric sweeteners, these <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> have attracted attention as candidates for the control of obesity, oral health and diabetic management. Significant advances have been made in the characterization of the sweet-tasting <b>plant</b> <b>proteins,</b> as well as their binding interactions with the appropriate receptors. The elucidation of sweet-taste receptor gene sequences represents an important step towards the understanding of sweet taste perception. However, many questions on the molecular basis of sweet-taste elicitation by <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> remain unanswered. In particular, why homologues of these proteins do not elicit similar responses? This question is discussed in this report, on the basis of available sequences and structures of sweet-tasting proteins, as well as of sweetness-sensing receptors. A simple procedure based on sequence comparisons between sweet-tasting protein and its homologous counterparts was proposed to identify critical residues for sweetness elicitation. The open question on the physiological function of sweet-tasting <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> is also considered. In particular, this review leads us to suggest that sweet-tasting proteins may interact with taste receptor in a serendipity manner. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|Abstract Background Post {{transcriptional}} {{gene silencing}} (PTGS) is a recently discovered phenomenon that {{is an area of}} intense research interest. Components of the PTGS machinery are being discovered by genetic and bioinformatics approaches, but the picture is not yet complete. Results The gene for the PTGS impaired Arabidopsis mutant sgs 3 was recently cloned and was not found to have similarity to any other known protein. By a detailed analysis of the sequence of SGS 3 we have defined three new protein domains: the XH domain, the XS domain and the zf-XS domain, that are shared with a large family of uncharacterised <b>plant</b> <b>proteins.</b> This work implicates these <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> in PTGS. Conclusion The enigmatic SGS 3 protein has been found to contain two predicted domains in common with a family of <b>plant</b> <b>proteins.</b> The other members of this family have been predicted to be transcription factors, however this function seems unlikely based on this analysis. A bioinformatics approach has implicated a new family of <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> related to SGS 3 as potential candidates for PTGS related functions. </p...|$|R

40|$|In proteomic {{analyses}} of the plant secretome, the presence of putative leaderless secretory proteins (LSPs) is difficult to confirm due {{to the possibility of}} contamination from other sub-cellular compartments. In the absence of a plant-specific tool for predicting LSPs, the mammalian-trained SecretomeP has been applied to <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> in multiple studies to identify the most likely LSPs. This study investigates the effectiveness of using SecretomeP on <b>plant</b> <b>proteins,</b> identifies its limitations and provides a benchmark for its use. In the absence of experimentally verified LSPs we exploit the common-feature hypothesis behind SecretomeP and use known classically secreted <b>proteins</b> (CSPs) of <b>plants</b> as a proxy to evaluate its accuracy. We show that, contrary to the common-feature hypothesis, plant CSPs are a poor proxy for evaluating LSP detection due to variation in the SecretomeP prediction scores when the signal peptide (SP) is modified. Removing the SP region from CSPs and comparing the predictive performance against non-secretory proteins indicates that commonly used threshold scores of 0. 5 and 0. 6 result in false-positive rates in excess of 0. 3 when applied to <b>plants</b> <b>proteins.</b> Setting the false-positive rate to 0. 05, consistent with the original mammalian performance of SecretomeP, yields only a marginally higher true positive rate compared to false positives. Therefore the use of SecretomeP on <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> is not recommended. This study investigates the trade-offs of using SecretomeP on <b>plant</b> <b>proteins</b> and provides insights into predictive features for future development of plant-specific common-feature tools...|$|R
