40|$|BACKGROUND: For {{nearly two}} decades, {{dermatology}} has associated with psychology {{to find a}} better way to care for dermatology conditions. A scientific trend called psychosomatics is creating a link between dermatology and psychology. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to examine two concepts closely linked to <b>psychodermatology</b> (life events and tendency to complain) and to emphasize the difference between factors playing a role in the onset of certain skin diseases (psoriasis, alopecia areata, benign tumors, eczema). RESULTS: We found that psoriasis patients have a greater tendency to complain than people with the other disease. This point to the importance of taking emotions into account when studying psoriasis. We also found that life events {{play a role in the}} onset of psoriasis and alopecia areata. Moreover, these events were anterior by more than 12 months in alopecia patients.

40|$|Dermatitis artefacta is {{a disease}} that {{occurs as a result}} of a self-inflicted injury of the skin. The skin lesions are most often located on the areas within easy reach of the patient’s {{dominant}} hand sparing the middle part of the back. Dermatitis artefacta may coexist with psychiatric disorders and imitate many dermatologic diseases. As most of the patients with self-inflicted dermatoses usually initially deny any psychiatric problems, what delays psychiatric intervention, they are typically first seen by dermatologists. We are reporting a case of a 35 -year-old man with a 3 -year-long history of schizophrenia who has been treated at a dermatologist’s office sequentially with acne, bacterial lesions, suspected tuberculosis. However, the treatment was ineffective. He was diagnosed with dermatitis artefacta after 7 years of disease duration. During this time he was treated with many medicines e. g. isotretinoin, which is contraindicated in psychosis as it worsens the course of disease. After establishing the correct diagnosis and antipsychotic treatment, a significant improvement was obtained in both skin condition and mental state.

40|$|<b>Psychodermatology</b> {{describes}} {{the interaction between}} mind and skin. Both the brain and the skin originate from the same germ layer, the embryonic ectoderm. Communication between mind and skin can be explained through the neuro-immuno-cutaneous-endocrine system. Emotional factors appear to significantly influence most skin diseases, and it is well recognized that stressful life events can trigger eruption of dermatological disease. Psychodermatologic disorders fall into three categories: psychophysiologic disorders, primary psychiatric disorders and secondary psychiatric disorders. Therapeutic options {{discussed in this article}} include standard psychotropic drugs and non-pharmacologic alternatives such as cognitive-behavioural therapy, hypnosis and biofeedback. Anxiolytic medication, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and sedative antihistamines are the main groups of psychopharmacologic treatment used. Cognitive behavioural methods may resolve dysfunctional thought patterns or actions that damage the skin or interfere with dermatologic therapy. Hypnosis is an alternative or complimentary therapy that has been used since ancient times to treat medical problems, and may improve or resolve numerous dermatoses. Biofeedback can be helpful in cutaneous problems that have an autonomic nervous system component. This article is an attempt to summarize the literature in the field of psychodermatologic disorders, focusing on treatment alternatives.

40|$|Philip D ShenefeltDepartment of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery, College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USAAbstract: The {{nervous system}} and the skin develop {{next to each other}} in the embryo and remain intimately {{interconnected}} and interactive throughout life. The nervous system can influence skin conditions through psychoneuroimmunoendocrine mechanisms and through behaviors. Understanding the pathophysiology aids in selection of treatment plans for correcting the negative effects of the psyche on specific skin conditions. Medication options include standard psychotropic medications and alternative herbs and supplements. Other options include biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral methods, hypnosis, meditation, progressive relaxation, the placebo effect, and suggestion. When simple measures fail, combining medications with other therapeutic options may produce better results. Skin conditions that have strong psychophysiologic aspects may respond well to techniques such as biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral methods, hypnosis, meditation, or progressive relaxation that help to counteract stress. Treatment of primary psychiatric disorders that negatively influence skin conditions often results in improvement of those skin conditions. Abnormal conditions of the skin, hair, and nails can also influence the psyche negatively. Treatment of secondary psychiatric disorders such as anxiety or depression that are triggered or exacerbated by the appearance of these skin conditions or the associated discomfort may also be required.

The inspiration for a new tool measuring the emotional and cognitive representation of skin was the psychological conception of the ‘skin ego’. Participants and procedure My Skin, a self-questionnaire (MSQ), was used to measure the emotional and cognitive representation of an individual’s skin. It consists of two main scales: satisfaction with the skin condition (AB) and awareness of the biopsychosocial functions of the skin (C). The Body Esteem Scale, Body Self Questionnaire and Self-Esteem Scale were used to validate the MSQ. The participants were: healthy individuals (n = 343) and dermatology patients (psoriasis, vitiligo, juvenile acne, n = 84). Results The psychometric parameters are presented in this article. The internal consistency reliabilities for subscales are in the range of. 75 and. 95.

Drugs for neuropathic pain are often used, but with little success. AIM To review a series of patients with DPSD to highlight common themes and response to treatment. METHODS Ten consecutive patients with DPSD were identified from specialist male genital dermatology and <b>psychodermatology</b> clinics at two centres. Clinical details, including psychiatric history, were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with no previously diagnosed psychiatric illness completed either the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) - 7 scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) - 9 depression scale, or the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). RESULTS Of the 10 patients, 9 had known or newly diagnosed psychopathology. All patients were offered psychodermatological treatment, of which 7 of 10 accepted. All of those who accepted psychodermatological treatment experienced an improvement in their genital symptoms. When post-treatment scores were collected, improvement in psychiatric symptoms accompanied improvement in genital symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Psychopathology is almost invariably present in individuals with DPSD, yet these patients rarely volunteer such information.

40|$|Depressive {{disorders}} {{are more common}} in the population affected with dermatologic disorders. Comorbidity of depression and dermatologic disorders is around 30 %. The correlation between depressive and dermatologic disorders still remains unclear. In <b>psychodermatology</b> three {{disorders are}} described: a) psycho-physiological disorders (both disorders induced and maintained by stressors), b) secondary psychiatric disorders (mental disorder as a result of skin leasions and treatment) and c) primary psychiatric disorders (skin alterations as a result of mental disorders and treatment). In depression and dermatology disorders in which certain precipitating factors are required thereby causing alteration of the patient's immunological identity causing a combination of hereditary features and ones acquired through adaptation occur to cause the disorder to develop. The cytokines are vital in the regulation of the immunology response and are also mediators of non-infective inflammatory processes leading to recurrent hormonal secretion affecting the function of the vegetative and central nervous system leading to so called „sickness behaviour“, marked by loss of appetite, anhedonia, anxiety, decrease of concentration and interest along with other changes which generate a picture of depressive disorder. Treatment of depressive and dermatologic disorders is complex and requires an integral therapeutic approach encompassing all aspects of both disorders and their comorbidity. Therefore therapeutic success lies in a team approach to the patient under the auspice of consultative-liason psychiatry by setting the frame for efficient collaboration and bridging the gap between the mental and the physical in everyday clinical practice.

40|$|Cody J Connor Department of Dermatology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA Abstract: Dermatological {{disease can}} be devastating for patients, and {{although}} dermatologists are focused on remedying the cutaneous manifestations of these conditions, {{it is easy to}} miss the psychological suffering lurking below. Studies reveal that psychiatric comorbidity in dermatology is highly prevalent. Undetected psychopathology can greatly decrease a patient’s quality of life and even contribute significantly to the clinical severity of their skin disease. For these reasons, it is vital that practitioners learn to detect psychological distress when it is present, and it is equally essential that they understand the treatment options available for effective intervention. Without training in psychiatric diagnosis and psychopharmacology, dermatologists can easily feel overwhelmed or out of their comfort zone when faced with the need to manage such conditions, but with the negative stigma associated with psychiatric disease in general, a psychiatric referral is often refused by patients, and the dermatologist is thus left with the responsibility. Uncertainty abounds in such situations, but this review seeks to alleviate the discomfort with psychodermatological disease and share practical and impactful recommendations to assist in diagnosis and treatment. In a busy dermatology clinic, the key is effective and efficient screening, combined with a repertoire of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options that can be dispersed through an algorithmic approach according to the specific findings of that screening. By implementing these recommendations into practice, dermatologists may begin to gain comfort with the management of psychocutaneous disease and, as a specialty, may expand to fill a hole in patient care that is truly significant for patients, their families, and our communities as a whole.

40|$|Background: Many {{studies have}} {{addressed}} the impact of psoriasis on quality of life, but few studies have investigated patient perception of the disease or the patient-physician relationship. As with most chronic diseases, improvement in the patient-physician relationship may be important in the proper management of patients with psoriasis. Objectives: To assess how psoriasis and its treatments are subjectively experienced by patients as well as patient expectations {{with regard to the}} patient-physician relationship. Methods: A discussion agenda for 'focus group meetings' was organized by a group of sociologists, psychologists, educators, researchers, and clinicians active in the field of <b>psychodermatology.</b> Four meetings were held in Northern and Central Italy and participants included one moderator and either eight dermatologists or eight patients. Discussions were based on a predefined agenda and included: (i) the psychological representation of psoriasis; (ii) the hetero- and self-perception of the patient; (iii) the patient-physician relationship; and (iv) the development of an educational intervention for dermatologists in order to improve the patient-physician relationship. A questionnaire, based on the information gathered at the focus groups, was administered to 323 patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis from 17 dermatology clinics throughout Italy. Results: Three hundred patients completed the questionnaire. Psoriasis elicited anger, annoyance at the inconvenience of the disease, and irritation in approximately 50 % of the patients, whilst 38 % of patients were unable to describe their emotional state. Aspects of life that were limited by psoriasis included clothing (57 %), social interactions (43 %), and personal hygiene (31 %). The disease was often seen by patients as incomprehensible, incurable, and uncontrollable. More than half of the patients stressed their need to be listened to by the treating physician, and their wish that the physician should use simple language and should improve their psychological skills and interpersonal communication techniques. Conclusions: Dermatologists need to convey to patients with psoriasis the feeling of 'understanding the disease,' of hope about its curability, and the 'perception of control. ' These elements should be taken into account when treating patients and whenever educational interventions are planned...|$|E
40|$|Psoriasis is {{a chronic}} {{autoimmune}} skin condition that can impair psychological, social, and physical functioning. The psychological implications of psoriasis {{can be highly}} disturbing and {{a significant number of}} patients with psoriasis live with considerable and enduring psychological distress. An accumulating body of evidence suggests that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) may be the most effective in ameliorating the psychological distress resulting from living with psoriasis. CBT has been effective in reducing the emotional distress, the quality of life impairment associated with psoriasis and as a result the clinical severity of it. The mechanisms behind these changes are not known, however. Outcome studies in CBT have shown that common factors (i. e., therapeutic relationship) and/or technical ones (i. e., CBT techniques) account for therapeutic change. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the factors that influence the treatment process and the outcome of CBT for individuals with psoriasis and develop a model of it. This study adopted a constructivist Grounded Theory approach. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine patients who had completed a course of CBT within the <b>Psychodermatology</b> Clinic of a hospital in England. From the analysis emerged the model of “Guided Therapeutic Growth” which was the core conceptual framework that subsumed the factors that influence the patients’ experiences of their therapeutic processes in CBT. These factors were: (a) “feeling engaged with the therapeutic process”; (b) “establishing a trusting therapeutic relationship”; (c) “legitimising the expression of distress associated with psoriasis”; and (d) “guided cognitive restructuring of the meanings attached to psoriasis”. The integration of these four interrelated factors forms a tentative model that was found to impact the therapeutic growth by reducing distress, alleviating emotional pain and helping individuals with psoriasis to become more self-compassionate, all of which were found to motivate and empower them to move forward and achieve positive changes in their adjustment to their psoriasis. Conversely, the absence of these factors or the presence of certain hindering conditions could compromise the therapeutic experience of CBT and jeopardise progress. In this context, the following hindering conditions were reported: (a) negative preconceived notions about homework; (b) too much or too little directiveness by the therapist; and (c) externalisation process of emotional release experienced by the patient as too revealing...|$|E

FEATURES OF SELF-RELATION IN COSMETOLOGICAL PATIENTS WITH HIGH SELF-ESTEEM M. Yudin Medical Center "CA Clinic", Kyiv, Ukraine; e-mail: yudin. mca@gmail. com Summary The aim of the research - to investigate features of self-esteem in {{patients with}} cosmetic problems. Contingent and methods. The study conducted at the Medical Center "CA Clinic" during 2014 – 2016 years, 178 women with cosmetic problems participated in the research. Results. Profile in women with high self-esteem characterized by self-confidence, a sense of perfection, perceptions of high own charm and personal qualities, making himself uncritical their shortcomings, self-trust, self-respect, hard confrontation in response to attacks or doubts about their identity from the other people. Overall,self-esteem was disharmonious, high positive self-assessment of own qualities combined with low self-reflection. Conclusions. Cosmetological patients who have high self-esteem constitute a separate category of clients and require the use of psychological measures aimed at harmonizing disharmonious self-relation.

40|$|The {{research}} {{outlined in}} this thesis stems from empirical work carried out with vitiligo sufferers {{over a period of}} 3 years, from 1995 to 1998. Vitiligo is a pigmentation disorder, which causes the destruction of melanocytes in the skin. The affected areas lose their pigmentation resulting in the appearance of irregular white patches over the surface of the skin. Although the appearance of the skin can change dramatically, vitiligo does not cause any pain or physical discomfort, nor is it in any way physically limiting. Therefore the psychological effects of the disfiguring nature of this condition can be studied independently of other physical changes. The present research was prompted by the recognition that empirical studies in the field of <b>psychodermatology</b> are scarce, especially with regard to the effects of skin disease on psychological health. Vitiligo provides a unique opportunity to examine the psychological impact of disfigurement in the absence of other variables such as pain, or trauma. Furthermore, unlike other skin conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis, few empirical studies have been carried out to examine the impact of a patient's psychological state on the progression of vitiligo and therefore, an opportunity to undertake some preliminary research in this field was identified. The main thesis of the research outlined herein is that mental state and physiological state are not independent of each other for vitiligo sufferers. A patient's psychological state may influence the onset or progression of their condition, and the appearance of the condition may impact upon a patient's psychosocial functioning. With this hypothesis in mind, a series of studies were undertaken, examining the interaction between mental and physiological state in vitiligo. Four central hypotheses were examined: 1. Newly diagnosed vitiligo patients experience a higher proportion of stressful life events in the year preceding the onset of their condition, than a matched clinical sample. 2. Psychological counselling using cognitive behaviour therapy helps to improve the body image, self esteem and quality of life of vitiligo patients and may impact upon the progression of their condition. 3. Being involved in a non-directive support group helps to improve the body image, self esteem and quality of life in vitiligo sufferers. 4. Variation exists across vitiligo sufferers regarding their beliefs about the onset, course and symptomatology of their condition. These beliefs will vary according to demographic variables. It is anticipated that amongst others, the present study may be of interest to clinical and counselling psychologists and counsellors working in the field of disfigurement, dermatologists, nurses, general practitioners and other health professionals who have face-to-face contact with dermatology patients, and health and social psychologists involved in research in this field...|$|E

The supposed link between COPD and its systemic effects on distal organs {{could be due}} to the low-grade systemic inflammation. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the systemic inflammation may influence the skin condition in COPD patients. Materials and methods: Forty patients with confirmed diagnosis of COPD and a control group consisting of 30 healthy smokers and 20 healthy never-smokers were studied. Transepidermal water loss, stratum corneum hydration, skin sebum content, melanin index, erythema index, and skin temperature were measured with worldwide-acknowledged biophysical measuring methods at the volar forearm of all participants using a multifunctional skin physiology monitor. Biomarkers of systemic inflammation, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), were measured in serum using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: There were significant differences between COPD patients and healthy never-smokers in skin temperature, melanin index, sebum content, and hydration level (P< 0. 05), but not for transepidermal water loss and erythema index. No significant difference was noted between COPD patients and smokers in any of the biophysical properties of the skin measured. The mean levels of hsCRP and IL- 6 in serum were significantly higher in COPD patients and healthy smokers in comparison with healthy never-smokers. There were significant correlations between skin temperature and serum hsCRP (R= 0. 40; P= 0. 02) as well as skin temperature and serum IL- 6 (R= 0. 49; P= 0. 005) in smokers. Stratum corneum hydration correlated significantly with serum TNF-α (R= 0. 37; P= 0. 01) in COPD patients. Conclusion: Differences noted in several skin biophysical properties and biomarkers of systemic inflammation between COPD patients, smokers, and healthy never-smokers may suggest a possible link between smoking-driven, low-grade systemic inflammation, and the overall skin condition.
