40|$|This study {{confirms}} that eating food {{away from home}} (FAFH) adversely affects dietary intake. By looking at changes within individuals’ dietary intake over two days, thus controlling for self-selection issues, we find that FAFH causes increased caloric intake and reduced diet quality. Our estimates {{on the effect of}} specific meals show that lunch and dinner consumed away from home have the largest effect on total daily caloric intake, but that breakfast has the largest negative effect on total diet quality. In particular, eating breakfast away from home decreases intake of fruit, whole grains and dairy and increases the <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> saturated fats and solid fats, alcohol and added sugar. Eating lunch and dinner away from home also reduce diet quality, affecting similar dietary components, with dinner away from home also reducing vegetable intake.

40|$|Abstract Background Food {{insecurity}} among Mexican-origin and Hispanic households is {{a critical}} nutritional health issue of national importance. At the same time, nutrition-related health conditions, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, are increasing in Mexican-origin youth. Risk factors for obesity and type 2 diabetes are more common in Mexican-origin children and include increased intakes of energy-dense and nutrient-poor foods. This study assessed the relationship between children's experience of food insecurity and nutrient intake from food and beverages among Mexican-origin children (age 6 - 11 y) who resided in Texas border colonias. Methods Baseline data from 50 Mexican-origin children were collected in the home by trained promotora -researchers. All survey (demographics and nine-item child food security measure) and 24 -hour dietary recall data were collected in Spanish. Dietary data were collected in person on three occasions using a multiple-pass approach; nutrient intakes were calculated with NDS-R software. Separate multiple regression models were individually fitted for total energy, protein, dietary fiber, calcium, vitamin D, potassium, sodium, Vitamin C, and percentage {{of calories from fat}} and added sugars. Results Thirty-two children (64 %) reported low or very low food security. Few children met the recommendations for calcium, dietary fiber, and sodium; and none for potassium or vitamin D. Weekend intake was lower than weekday for calcium, vitamin D, potassium, and vitamin C; and higher for <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat. Three-day average dietary intakes of total calories, protein, and <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> added sugars increased with declining food security status.

40|$|Caloric {{intake and}} minimum calorie {{thresholds}} {{are widely used}} in developing countries to assess hunger and nutrition, and to construct poverty lines. However, it is generally recognized that the sufficiency of an individual's caloric intake cannot be determined, due to: a lack of consensus on the true thresholds; the fact that any such thresholds are individual-varying and unobservable; imperfect nutrient absorption; and the weak and non-monotonic empirical relationship between calories and wealth. We propose a revealed preference approach to measuring hunger and undernutrition that overcomes these challenges. Low caloric intake {{is associated with a}} large utility penalty (e. g., physical discomfort). The corresponding high marginal utility <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> causes a utility-maximizing consumer to primarily consume the cheapest available source <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> (a staple). Once they have surpassed subsistence, the marginal utility <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> declines significantly and they substitute towards foods with higher levels of non-nutritional attributes (e. g., taste). Thus, though any individual's requirements are unobserved, their choice to switch away from the staple reveals they are above that requirement. Accordingly, the <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> obtained <b>from</b> the staple can be used to indicate nutritional sufficiency. We also provide an application for China that shows the desirable empirical properties of this approach. ...|$|R

Our aim was to explore the differential effects of changing income, assets, maternal education, and urbanicity on dietary behaviors of mothers and offspring that may affect overweight risk. Methods The study included a cohort of Filipino offspring and their mothers participating in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey at four time points from 1994 (n = 1, 885 pairs) to 2005 (n = 1, 349 pairs). The effect of socioeconomic factors and urbanicity, on dietary behaviors including energy adequacy, percent fat and carbohydrates were examined using longitudinal random-effects regression models. Results Mothers and offspring were consistently more likely to consume more calories relative to basal needs as well as a higher <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat and a lower percent from carbohydrates with higher socioeconomic status and urbanization.

Sb oxidation rate was determined using an isotopic sebacate (disodic salt of (1 - 10) 14 C-sebacic acid) infusion (100 mu Ci from the fourth to the eighth hour of the cold sebacate infusion). Blood samples were collected during and after sebacate infusion at intervals of 30 minutes and Sb serum concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Excreted radioactivity (mu Ci/min) was measured by bubbling the expired air into an apparatus containing 3 mEq hyamine to trap CO 2 from a 20 -L Douglas-bag. CO 2 production and O 2 consumption were measured before and at 4 and 8 hours after starting the infusion. Twenty-four hour nitrogen excretion with urine was obtained.

40|$|Food {{away from}} home (FAFH) has been {{associated}} with poor diet quality in many studies. It is difficult, however, to measure the effect of FAFH on diet quality since many unobserved factors, such as food preferences and time constraints, influence not just our choice of where to eat but also the nutritional quality of what we eat. Using data from 1994 - 96 and 2003 - 04, this study applies fixed-effects estimation to control for such unobservable influences and finds that, for the average adult, FAFH increases daily caloric intake and reduces diet quality. The effects vary depending on which meals are consumed {{away from home}}. On average, breakfast away from home decreases the number of servings of whole grains and dairy consumed per 1, 000 calories and increases the <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> saturated and solid fat, alcohol, and added sugar (SoFAAS) in a day. Dinner away from home reduces the number of servings of vegetables consumed per 1, 000 calories for the average adult. Breakfast and lunch away from home increase calories from saturated fat and SoFAAS on average more among dieters than among nondieters.

In {{the framework of the}} IMMIDIET Project, married couples, recruited randomly from general practice, were studied. One thousand six hundred and four apparently healthy subjects aged 25 - 74 years from three different European populations were enrolled. Individual cardiovascular risks were estimated using SCORE risk equations. Age was strongly correlated within couples (r = 0. 86, P < 0. 0001). In multivariate model, within-pair correlation was high for social status (r = 0. 49; percentage of explained variation = 24 %) and <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> lipids (r = 0. 34; 12 %). Concerning conventional metabolic risk factors, percentage of explained variation varied from 0. 5 % (triglycerides) to 11 % (glucose). Among new risk factors, activated factor VII showed the strongest correlation (r = 0. 28) and C-reactive protein the lowest (r = 0. 13). Either total, coronary or non-coronary risk estimates at 10 years were strongly correlated within pairs: the risk of a member explained about two thirds of the cardiovascular risk of the partner. Spouse pairs share common lifestyle habits, common and new metabolic risk factors and the predicted global risk of cardiovascular events.

40|$|Background: Arterial pulse pressure, the {{difference}} between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, {{has been used as}} an indicator (surrogate measure) of arterial stiffness. High arterial pulse pressure (3 ̆e 40) has been associated with increased cardiovascular disease and mortality. Several clinical trials have reported that the proportion <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> carbohydrate has an effect on blood pressure. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} assess arterial pulse pressure and its association with carbohydrate quantity and quality (glycemic load) with diabetes status for a Cuban American population. Methods: A single point analysis included 367 participants. There was complete data for 365 (190 with and 175 without type 2 diabetes). The study was conducted in the investigator’s laboratory located in Miami, Florida. Demographic, dietary, anthropometric and laboratory data were collected. Arterial pulse pressure was calculated by the formula systolic minus the diastolic blood pressure.

40|$|In {{the first}} study, 80 male, {{weanling}} Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets varied in source of fat at a 5 {{percent by weight}} level in order to vary omega- 3 fatty acid intakes in fats varied in degree of saturation. Fat sources used included the following: Canola oil, soybean oil, fish oil, olive oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, and fish oil combined with soybean, olive and hydrogenated vegetable oils. Blood serum HDL cholesterol levels were significantly higher with the polyunsaturated than with monounsaturated fat feeding and with feeding of non-fish oil supplemented oils than when fish oil supplements were used. Lower blood serum triglyceride levels were obtained with canola and fish oil feeding as compared to other w- 3 supplemented test oils. Canola and olive oil feeding resulted in an overall increase in liver and heart total lipid and cholesterol concentrations than did the feeding of the test oils high in polyunsaturated fatty acids. ^ In the second study, eleven human adults were fed laboratory controlled diets providing 30 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat; however, two-thirds of the fat (20 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the total dietary fat) in each period for each subject was provided {{by one of the}} three test oils: soybean oil, w- 3 enriched soybean oil and canola oil. Under conditions of high fiber intake, canola oil feeding of humans produced significantly lower blood fasting serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, phospholipid and higher HDL cholesterol levels than did the feeding of soybean oil. ^ In the third study, acceptability of different bran breads containing soybean oil, w- 3 enriched soybean oil and canola oil were evaluated. Test panelists judged soybean oil or canola oil containing breads as the most acceptable products in the rating test and judged w- 3 enriched soybean oil containing breads as unacceptable. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary There {{is ample}} {{reason to believe}} that diets rich in phytochemicals provide {{protection}} from vascular diseases and many cancers; direct antioxidant activity as well as modulation of enzyme expression or hormone activity contribute to this effect. Phytochemicals derived from diverse foods presumably can interact additively and (possibly) synergistically; thus, the total dietary load of phytochemicals may have important implications for health. As a means of very roughly quantifying this load, a “phytochemical index ” (PI) is proposed, defined as the <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> dietary <b>calories</b> derived <b>from</b> foods rich in phytochemicals. <b>Calories</b> derived <b>from</b> fruits, vegetables (excluding potatoes), legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruit/vegetable juices, soy products, wine, beer, and cider – and foods compounded therefrom – would be counted in this index. Partial credit could be given for antioxidant-rich extra virgin olive oil. Other added oils, refined sugars, refined grains, potato products, hard liquors, and animal products – regrettably, the chief sources <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> in typical Western diets – would be excluded. Although the PI would provide only a very rough approximation of the quantity or quality of phytochemical nutrition, it nonetheless could aid epidemiologists in exploring the health consequences of diets high in phytochemical-rich plant foods, and could also help clinical nutritionists in their efforts to improve the phytochemical nutrition of their clients. c 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{identified}} potential detrimental sequelae of cholesterol and fat-lowering interventions in randomized trials. Little {{research has been}} published to document changes in mental health in women {{as a result of}} fat and cholesterol lowering interventions to prevent chronic disease. This paper examines the relationships among changes in dietary fat consumption and mental health in the Women’s Health Trial, a randomized, controlled trial to determine whether lowering fat consumption to 20 % of daily calories could reduce the incidence of breast cancer in women ages 45 - 69 years. Assessments were made at baseline and at the 12 -month follow-up of several aspects of quality of life, including negative and positive affect and past, present, and future perceptions of health. Mental health variables were measured by the Mental Health Inventory, a standardized scale used in the Medical Outcomes study. Dietary intake was assessed for all subjects with the use of semiquantitative food frequency questionnaires. The change in mental health values (follow-up minus baseline) was significantly different between intervention and control groups for three of the four psychological variables: (a) anxiety; (b) depression; and (c) vigor. In all three cases, the direction of the change for intervention women was positive. Neither randomization assignment nor <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat at the follow-up visit were significant predictors of mental health at the 1 -year follow-up. Cholesterol changes were not related to levels of mental health variables in a sample of the women. These data indicate that lowering fat in the diets of healthy women does not produce overall lowering of any mental health variables. These findings are encouraging, because lowering dietary fat is a national priority and will receive more research and public health attention in future years...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [33]- 35) In this investigation, {{factors associated}} with bodymass index (BMI), three-year weight fluctuation, and threeyear net weight change were identified. The subjects were 60 women {{ranging in age from}} 24 to 74 and were of varying degrees of adiposity. These subjects had participated in the Women's Nutrition Project each year and were not pregnant and/or lactating between the first year and the fourth year. Factors selected for this study included age, waist/hip ratio, triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), mid-arm circumference (MAC), caloric intake, <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> fat intake, Eating Anxiety Index, Eating Restraint, report of dieting, reproductive history, activity patterns, exercise fluctuation, Health Practices Index, Satisfaction with Health Practices Index, Satisfaction with Food Intake Index, Holmes and Rahe Life Events Scale, Outlook Index, Importance of Slenderness Index, Husband Involvement Index, and Husband Pressure Index. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to identify correlations between the dependent variables and independent variables in order to aid in determining the appropriate model for subsequent multiple regression determinations. Two sets of multiple regression with and without anthropometric factors were calculated to predict the value of a dependent variable - BMI in year 4, threeyear weight fluctuation, and three-year net weight change - from a group of independent variables. The multiple regression equation revealed that four variables, initial TSF, MAC, waist/hip ratio, and caloric intake in year 1 accounted for 71. 7 {{percent of the variance in}} the final BMI. Initial BMI and Health Practices Index were predictive factors for weight fluctuation and accounted for 27. 8 percent of the variance in weight fluctuation over three years. Initial BMI and Health Practices Index entered the multiple regression equation and accounted for 26. 3 percent of the variance in three-year net weight change. When anthropometric variables were removed from the group of the independent variables, caloric intake in year 1 and Eating Anxiety Index accounted for 29. 7 percent of the variance in the final BMI. Eating Restraint accounted for 14. 5 percent of the variance in three-year weight fluctuation. Caloric intake in year 1 and Health Practices Index accounted for 18. 9 percent of the variance in threeyear net weight change. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} pregnant women who developed GDM {{as compared to}} those who did not. Maternal nutrient consumption, plasma phospholipid (PL) fatty acids (FA), and infant sleep states, as a determinant of maturity of the central nervous system (CNS), were assessed. Maternal plasma insulin and glucose levels, measures of short- and long-term glucose control, and infant glucose levels were examined. ^ In Study 1 the relationship of plasma PL LC-PUFA with infant sleep patterns was determined. Women with and without GDM were recruited at approximately 26 weeks of gestation and followed through delivery. Infant sleep-wake patterns were recorded in the first 48 postnatal hours. Sleep-wake patterns of infants born to women with GDM were typical of a less well developed CNS, while those infants born to women with uncomplicated pregnancies exhibited patterns typical of a more well developed CNS. ^ Study 2 addressed the efficacy of MNT in the treatment of GDM by assessing the dietary intake of women with GDM as compared with that of control subjects using repeated 24 -hour recalls. Women with GDM received dietary education and guidance from Registered Dietitians. Women with GDM had more appropriate energy intake, lower fat intake and a higher <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> polyunsaturated fats than did controls, suggesting MNT was effective. ^ Study 3 was an assessment of dietary intake of EFA and LC-PUFA in pregnant women with and without GDM to determine whether diets have changed in the last decade with respect to dietary FA. Dietary intake was assessed using repeated 24 -hour recalls. Results were consistent with those reported by Wijendren et al. (1) a decade ago, indicating a need to educate pregnant women about the importance and sources of LC-PUFA, especially DHA. ^ Clearly, maternal dietary LC-PUFA, especially DHA, is important to fetal development. Additionally, nutrition education provided by Registered Dietitians positively impacts dietary intake of macronutrients. It appears that limited progress has been made vis-à-vis increasing intake of n- 3 as compared to n- 6 fatty acids. Finally, it is clear nutrition education should be expanded to all pregnant women to assure the most favorable outcome for all infants. ...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [45]- 50) The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine if the nutrient composition of noon meals prepared according to the American Heart Association guidelines for restaurants (heart-healthy meals) were significantly different in calories, cholesterol, total fat, saturated fat, sodium, polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat (P/S) ratio and <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>calories</b> (kcal) <b>from</b> fat from the noon meal of the average American. The study compared mean values of 126 heart-healthy meals obtained from the American Heart Association Cookbook and four restaurants from the Chicagoland area to reported noon intakes of male and female participants between the ages of 18 to 74 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II, 1976 - 80). Noted nutritional composition of noon meals of participants were compared by sex and age catagories, and food sources. The heart-healthy meals contained significantly less calories, cholesterol, fat and sodium than contained in the meals consumed by male NHANES II participants no matter whether the meal was obtained from home, school, restaurant or other source. Female NHANES II participants consumed significantly less calories and cholesterol than contained in the heart-healthy meals but significantly more fat and sodium regardless of the food source. For males the caloric and cholesterol content of meals were associated with age. Younger men consumed more calories and cholesterol than older men. P/S ratio was significantly lower and <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> kcal from fat were significantly higher for the self-selected noon meal from NHANES II than heart-healthy meals for all groups compared. To reduce the risk of hypercholesterolemia, younger American males could reduce intake <b>of</b> total <b>calories,</b> cholesterol, fat and sodium by substituting a self-selected noon meal with a heart-healthy meal. If females from NHANES II substituted a heart-healthy meal for a self-selected noon meal they would increase calories and cholesterol but fat and sodium would be decreased. Overall the fat-related and sodium content of the heart-healthy meals were more conducive to reduce the risk of hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Therefore, heart-healthy meals served at some restaurants should be brought to the attention of the public. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
40|$|Cuban Americans, a {{minority}} Hispanic subgroup, {{have a high}} prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Persons with diabetes experience {{a higher rate of}} coronary heart disease (CHD) compared to those without diabetes. The objectives of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK) are to investigate the risk factors of CHD and the etiology of diabetes among diabetics of minority ethnic populations. No information is available on the etiology of CHD risks for Cuban Americans. ^ This cross-sectional study compared Cuban Americans with (N = 79) and without (N = 80) type 2 diabetes residing in South Florida. Data on risk factors of CHD and type 2 diabetes were collected using sociodemographics, smoking habit, Rose Angina, Modifiable Activity, and Willet 2 ̆ 7 s food frequency questionnaires. Anthropometrics and blood pressure (BP) were recorded. Glucose, glycated hemoglobin, lipid profile, homocysteine, and C-reactive protein were assessed in fasting blood. ^ Diabetics reported a significantly higher rate of angina symptoms than non-diabetics (P = 0. 008).

40|$|Abstract Background Multiple N -nitroso {{compounds}} {{have been}} observed in animal studies to be both mutagenic and teratogenic. Human exposure to N -nitroso compounds and their precursors, nitrates and nitrites, can occur through exogenous sources, such as diet, drinking water, occupation, or environmental exposures, and through endogenous exposures resulting from the formation of N -nitroso compounds in the body. Very little information is available on intake of nitrates, nitrites, and nitrosamines and factors related to increased consumption of these compounds. Methods Using survey and dietary intake information from control women (with deliveries of live births without major congenital malformations during 1997 - 2004) {{who participated in the}} National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS), we examined the relation between various maternal characteristics and intake of nitrates, nitrites, and nitrosamines from dietary sources. Estimated intake of these compounds was obtained from the Willet Food Frequency Questionnaire as adapted for the NBDPS. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for the consumption of these compounds by self-reported race/ethnicity and other maternal characteristics. Results Median intake per day for nitrates, nitrites, total nitrites (nitrites + 5 % nitrates), and nitrosamines was estimated at 40. 48 mg, 1. 53 mg, 3. 69 mg, and 0. 472 μg respectively. With the lowest quartile of intake as the referent category and controlling for daily caloric intake, factors predicting intake of these compounds included maternal race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, household income, area of residence, folate intake, and <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> daily <b>calories</b> <b>from</b> dietary fat. Non-Hispanic White participants were less likely to consume nitrates, nitrites, and total nitrites per day, but more likely to consume dietary nitrosamines than other participants that participated in the NBDPS. Primary food sources of these compounds also varied by maternal race/ethnicity. Conclusions Results {{of this study indicate that}} intake of nitrates, nitrites, and nitrosamines vary considerably by race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, and other characteristics. Further research is needed regarding how consumption of foods high in nitrosamines and N -nitroso precursors might relate to risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and chronic diseases. </p...|$|R
