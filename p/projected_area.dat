5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> of the part being moulded. This <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E

Since the radiance is isotropic (i.e. independent of direction), the power emitted {{at an angle}} to the normal is proportional to the <b>projected</b> <b>area,</b> and therefore to the cosine of that angle as per Lambert's cosine law, and is unpolarized.|$|E
25|$|As {{the speed}} of an object increases, so does the drag force acting on it, which also depends on the {{substance}} it is passing through (for example air or water). At some speed, the drag or force of resistance will equal the gravitational pull on the object (buoyancy is considered below). At this point the object ceases to accelerate and continues falling at a constant speed called the terminal velocity (also called settling velocity). An object moving downward faster than the terminal velocity (for example because it was thrown downwards, it fell from a thinner part of the atmosphere, or it changed shape) will slow down until it reaches the terminal velocity. Drag depends on the <b>projected</b> <b>area,</b> here, the object's cross-section or silhouette in a horizontal plane. An object with a large <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> relative to its mass, such as a parachute, has a lower terminal velocity than one with a small <b>projected</b> <b>area</b> relative to its mass, such as a bullet.|$|E

40|$|An archaeological survey-reconnaissance of the Sweetwater Creek <b>project</b> <b>area,</b> {{located in}} Philadelphia, Tennessee, was {{conducted}} {{by one of the}} authors during April, 1981.

[...] The amplitude of light scattered from within any transparent dielectric {{is proportional to the}} inverse square of its wavelength and to the volume of material, that is to the cube of its {{characteristic length}}. The wavelength dependence is characteristic of dipole scattering and the volume dependence will apply to any scattering mechanism. Objects with x ≫ 1 act as geometric shapes, scattering light according to their <b>projected</b> <b>area.</b> At the intermediate x ≃ 1 of Mie scattering, interference effects develop through phase variations over the object's surface. Rayleigh scattering applies to the case when the scattering particle is very small (x ≪ 1, with a particle size < 1 /10 wavelength) and the whole surface re-radiates with the same phase. [...] Because the particles are randomly positioned, the scattered light arrives at a particular point with a random collection of phases; it is incoherent and the resulting intensity is just the sum of the squares of the amplitudes from each particle and therefore proportional to the inverse fourth power of the wavelength and the sixth power of its size. In detail, the intensity I of light scattered by any one of the small spheres of diameter d and refractive index n from a beam of unpolarized light of wavelength λ and intensity I0 is given by ...|$|E
