40|$|Long-exposure spectro-polarimetry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{near-infrared}} is {{a preferred}} method {{to measure the}} magnetic field and other physical properties of solar <b>prominences.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> past, {{it has been very}} difficult to observe <b>prominences</b> <b>in</b> this way with sufficient spatial resolution to fully understand their dynamical properties. Solar prominences contain highly transient structures, visible only at small spatial scales; hence they must be observed at sub-arcsecond resolution, with a high temporal cadence. An adaptive optics (AO) system capable of directly locking-on to prominence structure away from the solar limb has the potential to allow for diffraction-limited spectro-polarimetry of solar <b>prominences.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, <b>the</b> performance of the off-limb AO system and its expected performance, at the desired science wavelength 8542 A, are shown...|$|R

A model based on 2 D magnetohydrodynamic equations takes into account gravity, compressible flows, heating, radiation, anisotropic thermal conduction, and coupling to a deep chromosphere. It is found that <b>prominences</b> <b>in</b> simple arcades characterized by magnetic field with significant curvature at the apex are unstable to a lateral displacement...|$|R

5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} {{formed as}} a set of military outposts {{as an extension of the}} French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} <b>the</b> {{roles of}} <b>prominences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> solar scheme. Attention {{is given to}} classifications and <b>the</b> ways <b>in</b> which <b>prominences</b> exist: hydrostatic support, ballistic support, and magnetic support. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of ballistic support, surges are differentiated from sprays which involve the ejection of material that is already above the solar surface. Discussion also covers filimets and fibrils and the conditions for their appearance. It is proposed that most flares originate <b>in</b> <b>prominence</b> instabilities. <b>In</b> addition supergranulation is covered, noting the network is not seen on the boundary of unipolar regions.

The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from {{the first half of}} the 1st millennium CE, but only gained <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West in the 20th century.

5|$|After a {{prolonged}} power struggle, Khrushchev was finally ousted {{from his post}} as First Secretary in October 1964, charged with the failure of his reforms, his obsessive re-organizations of the Party and Government apparatus, his disregard for Party and Government institutions, and his one-man domineering leadership style. The Presidium (Politburo), the Central Committee and other important Party–Government bodies had grown tired of Khrushchev's repeated violations of established Party principles. The Soviet leadership also believed that his individualistic leadership style ran contrary to the ideal collective leadership. Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev in his posts as First Secretary and Premier respectively, and Mikhail Suslov, Andrei Kirilenko, and Anastas Mikoyan (replaced in 1965 by Nikolai Podgorny), were also given <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new leadership.

On his father's side, Alexios was also closely related to the imperial family of the Palaiologoi, through his grandmother, Martha Palaiologina, a sister of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1261). Alexios married Theodora Akropolitissa, daughter of Constantine Akropolites and granddaughter of the historian George Akropolites.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Swedish and French avoid placing focused {{constituents}} at {{the left}} periphery of sentences.

Initial focal accents would overlap with the syntactically related accents, forcing a suboptimal prosodic structure. Further, we provide evidence for such a left-edge boundary tone in Swedish main clauses, as well as for a complementary strong tendency in Swedish to associate the right edge of sentences with focus...|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{disruptions}} caused by the Napoleonic Wars, the papal bull nominating Egan did not reach the United States until 1810. When it arrived, Egan traveled to St. Peter's Pro-cathedral in Baltimore, where he was ordained bishop by Carroll, assisted by Benedict Joseph Flaget and Jean-Louis de Cheverus, who had been appointed to bishoprics but {{had not yet been}} consecrated. Egan chose St. Mary's to serve as his pro-cathedral in Philadelphia. Even before Egan's installation, Philadelphia Catholics began to raise funds to expand the church in accordance with its new <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diocese. After their ordinations, the new bishops planned a council of the American church leadership for the near future; in fact, they did not meet until 1829, long after Egan's death.|$|E
5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2000s, there is no {{traditional}} recipe.

5|$|Clifford {{had already}} {{achieved}} <b>prominence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north where, {{as an ally}} of {{the son of the}} earl of Northumberland, he took part in a feud against the Neville family, the Percy's natural rivals in Yorkshire. This consisted of a series of armed raids, assaults and skirmishes, and included an ambush on one of the younger Nevilles' wedding party in 1453. Historians have seen a direct connection between his involvement in the local feud in the north with the Nevilles, and his involvement in the national struggle against the duke of York, whom the Nevilles were closely allied with in the late 1450s. Although this was supposedly a period of temporary peace between the factions, Clifford and his allies appear to have made numerous attempts to ambush the Neville and Yorkist lords.|$|E
