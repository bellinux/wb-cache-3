The five-year labor contract in dispute was imposed on Labor Day in 2006 after Congress failed to intervene. The FAA thus imposed a unilateral reduction in pay scale of approximately 30 percent on active air traffic controllers only—all other FAA employees, including air traffic staff (those air traffic employees not {{directly involved in the}} control of air traffic) and supervisors/management retained their pay scales. The following year the Federal Labor Relations Authority ruled against NATCA's 2006 grievance. In 2006, Blakey said the agency's final proposal would result in current controllers earning an average of $187,000 a year in pay and benefits after five-years, up from the current $166,000 average. NATCA disputed those figures, saying they included overtime needed because of staffing shortages.|$|E

40|$|California {{made history}} on September 23, 2002, when the nation’s first {{comprehensive}} paid family leave program was {{signed into law}} by former governor Gray Davis. Benefits provided by this pioneering legislation became available to most working Californians starting on July 1, 2004. The new law provides up to six weeks of <b>partial</b> <b>pay</b> – 55 % of weekly earnings up to a maximum of $ 728 per week – for eligible employees who need time off from work to bond with a new child or to care for a seriously ill family member. The program, funded entirely by a payroll tax on employees, builds on California’s existing State Disability Insurance (SDI) system, which for many years has provided income support for employees’ medical and pregnancy-related leaves. Like SDI, the new paid family leave program is extensive (although not universal) in coverage: apart from some selfemployed persons, virtually all private sector employees are included. 1 California’s new law is especially valuable for the growing numbers of low-wage workers, many of them female, who currently have limited access to employer-sponsored fringe benefits providing paid time off (such as paid sick leave and paid vacation). Until July 1, 2004, such benefits were the main sources of income support for employees who took leaves from work to bond with a new child or to provide care for a seriously ill family member. After briefly reviewing the various developments contributing to the recent growth in demand for time off from work as well as the political processes that led to the passage of California’s pioneering paid family leave legislation, this chapter analyzes new data on paid family leave from two recent state-level surveys—the fall 2003 Golden Bear Omnibus (GBO) survey of California adults and the 2003 Survey of California Establishments (SCE) of employers. 2 Although California adults responding to the GBO survey expressed overwhelming support for the idea of paid family leave, their awareness of the new law was surprisingly limited, with only about one in five respondents indicating that they were familiar with it. Awareness of the new law was especially low among the groups that are least likely to have access to employer-sponsored paid time off: women, low-wage workers,immigrants, and disadvantaged racial-ethnic groups. Ironically, these same groups expressed disproportionately favorable attitudes toward the idea of paid leave. The survey data also provide insight into the ways in which, prior to the implementation of the new law, employers and employees in the state handled the kinds of events that the paid family leave program now covers. Many employed Californians have taken family leaves in the past, the GBO data show. And the data from the SCE survey reveal that many employers in the state—especially those that are unionized, those with large numbers of employees, and those with a relatively large proportion of professional, managerial, and technical employees—already provided family and medical leave benefits beyond those required by law before the establishment of the new paid family leave program. The recent extension of such benefits to the much larger population covered by the legislation passed in 2002 could be its most far-reaching effect; realizing that potential, however, will require increasing public awareness of the law substantially...|$|E

Critics of performance-based incentive contracts stress their potential unintended effects, including cream-skimming and other gaming activities intended to raise measured performance outcomes. We analyze the incentive effects of performance-based contracts, as well as their impacts on provider job placement rates, using unique data on Dutch cohorts of unemployed and disabled workers that were assigned to private social welfare providers in 2002 - 2005. We take advantage of variation in contract design over this period, where procured contracts gradually moved from <b>partial</b> performance-contingent <b>pay</b> to contracts with 100 %-performance contingent reward schemes, and analyze the impact of these changes using panel data that allow us to control for cohort types and to develop explicit measures of selection into the programs.

Overall, moving to a system with contract payments fully contingent on performance appears to increase job placements for more readily employable workers, although it does not affect the duration of their jobs. social welfare, performance contracting...|$|R
40|$|American {{society does}} not require civil litigants to bear the actual cost of using the court; those costs are borne almost entirely by the {{taxpayer}} (i. e., the “civil judicial subsidy”). In this Article I ask: is that right? Or is there a more desirable way to apportion court usage costs {{between the state and}} litigants? I develop an evaluative framework that facilitates analysis of the purpose, contours, and cost of the current judicial subsidy. We subsidize court use because, in theory, there are certain “social positives” associated with public adjudication. To date the unspoken assumption has been that these social positives - which I categorize and identify - apply with equal force to all court uses by all players in all cases. To the extent that assumption is mistaken, a precisely measured, differentiated subsidy - one which distinguishes between different court uses and different players - may be more attractive than the status quo. I propose considering a <b>partial</b> user <b>pays</b> system, with a generous access subsidy to ensure non-wealthy litigants have court access; a subsidy for appeals; and a retributive tax on losing litigants (who are not otherwise exempted from costs) equal to the winner’s share of court costs.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, partial {{deduction}} of logic programs {{has been extended}} to conceptually embed folding. To this end, {{partial deduction}}s are no longer computed of single atoms, but rather of entire conjunctions; Hence the term “conjunctive partial deduction”. Conjunctive partial deduction aims at achieving unfold/fold-like program transformations such as tupling and deforestation within fully automated partial deduction. However, its merits greatly surpass that limited context: Also other major efficiency improvements are obtained through considerably improved side-ways information propagation. In this extended abstract, we investigate conjunctive partial deduction in practice. We describe the concrete options used in the implementation(s), look at abstraction in a practical Prolog context, include and discuss an extensive set of benchmark results. From these, we can conclude that conjunctive <b>partial</b> deduction indeed <b>pays</b> off in practice, thoroughly beating its conventional precursor {{on a wide range}} of small to medium size programs. However, controlling it in a perfect way proves far from obvious, and a range of challenging open problems remain as topics for further research. ...|$|R
40|$|The Boston {{mechanism}} is often criticized for its manipulability {{and the resulting}} negative implications for welfare and fairness. Nonetheless, {{it is one of}} the most popular school choice mechanisms used in practice. In this paper, we first study the traditional (näıve) Boston mechanism (NBM) in a setting with no priority structure and single uniform tie-breaking. We show that it imperfectly rank dominates the strategyproof Random Serial Dictatorship (RSD). We then formalize an adaptive variant of the Boston mechanism (ABM), which is also sometimes used in practice. We show that ABM has significantly better incentive properties than NBM (it is partially strategyproof), while it shares most of NBM’s efficiency advantages over RSD as markets get large. However, while a direct efficiency comparison of NBM and ABM via imperfect dominance is inconclusive, numerical simulations suggest that NBM is still somewhat more efficient than ABM, which can be interpreted as the cost of <b>partial</b> strategyproofness one <b>pays</b> when choosing ABM over NBM. Our results highlight the subtle trade-off between efficiency and strategyproofness a market designer must make when choosing between the two Boston mechanisms and RSD. 1...|$|R

Under the Jet-Share concept, a fractional owner purchases a portion of a speci c aircraft {{based on the number of}} actual ight hours needed annually and contracts with Jet-Share Co. to manage the aircraft [4] [10](seeboxfor leading fractional jet ownership programs). For example, one-eight-share owners get 100 hours ying time per year, while one-quartershare owners are entitled to 200 hours. To book a ight, an owner calls Jet-Share Co. and speci es the departure time, departure location and destination. Within the U. S., Jet-Share Co. guarantees the availability ofajettoanowner within 5 hours after it is ordered. Jet-Share Co. charges the owners only for actual ight time,incontrast to some aircraft charter companies which would charge their customers for the time it takes the plane to reach the customer for pickup and to return to its base after drop-o. A <b>partial</b> owner <b>pays</b> three separate fees for this program: a one-time purchase price for the fractional interest in the plane, amonthly management fee, which covers maintenance, insurance, administrative and pilot expenses, and an hourly fee for the time the jet is used.

40|$|AbstractPartial {{deduction}} in the Lloyd–Shepherdson framework cannot achieve certain optimisations {{which are}} possible by unfold/fold transformations. We introduce conjunctive partial deduction, {{an extension of}} partial deduction accommodating such optimisations, e. g., tupling and deforestation.

Correctness results are given for the framework with respect to computed answer semantics, least Herbrand model semantics, and finite failure semantics. Maintaining the well-known distinction between local and global control, we describe a basic algorithm for conjunctive partial deduction, and refine it into a concrete algorithm for which we prove termination. The problem of finding suitable renamings which remove redundant arguments {{turns out to be}} important, so we give an independent technique for this.

40|$|As {{the members}} of the “baby boom” {{generation}} — people born between 1946 and 1964 — approach retirement, the demographic profile of the U. S. workforce will undergo a substantial shift: a large number of older workers will be joined by relatively few new entrants to the labor force. According to the Census Bureau, while the number of people between the ages of 55 and 64 will grow by about 11 million between 2005 and 2025, {{the number of people who}} are 25 to 54 years old will grow by only 5 million. This trend could affect economic growth because labor force participation begins to fall after age 55. In 2006, 91 % of men and 76 % of women aged 25 to 54 participated in the labor force. In contrast, just 70 % of men and 58 % of women aged 55 to 64 were either working or looking for work in 2006. The rate of employment among persons age 55 and older is influenced by general economic conditions, eligibility for Social Security benefits, the availability of health insurance, and the prevalence and design of employer-sponsored pensions. Labor force participation among people 55 and older may, for example, be affected both by the trend away from defined-benefit pension plans that offer a monthly annuity for life to defined contribution plans that typically pay a lump-sum benefit. The declining percentage of employers that offer retiree health insurance also may result in more people continuing to work until they are eligible for Medicare at 65. Recent Census Bureau data show that the percentage of men and women age 62 and older who work in paid employment has risen over the past 10 years. In March 2007, 49 % of men aged 62 to 64 were employed, compared with 43 % in 1995 and 42 % in 1990. Of men aged 65 to 69, 33 % were employed in March 2007, compared with 27 % in 1995 and 26 % in 1990. Among women 62 to 64 years old, 42 % were working in March 2007, compared with 32 % in 1995 and 28 % in 1990, whereas among women 65 to 69 years old, 26 % were working in March 2007, compared with 17 % in 1995 and 1990. There also has been a trend toward more full-time employment among older Americans who work. In March 2007, 81 % of employed men aged 62 to 64 were working full-time, compared with 77 % in 1995 and 1990. Seventy-one percent of men aged 65 to 69 who were working in March 2007 were employed full-time, compared with 57 % in 1995 and 56 % in 1990. Among working women aged 62 to 64, 69 % worked full-time in March 2007, compared with 60 % in both 1995 and 1990, whereas among working women aged 65 to 69, 54 % were employed full-time in March 2007, compared with 43 % in 1995 and 44 % in 1990.
