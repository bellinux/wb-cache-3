40|$|Nd and Sr isotopic {{analyses}} {{were made on}} selected volcanic rocks of known stratigraphic age from a limited area in the “Green Tuff” region, northeastern Japan, and in adjacent areas. Two ultramafic inclusions from Ichinomegata were also analyzed. The volcanic rocks {{range in age from}} 27 to 6 Ma, and vary in ε_(Nd) from − 0. 9 to 5. 7 and in ε_(Sr) from 14. 1 to − 16. 3. The isotopic data plot generally along the region of the “mantle array”. When plotted against time, the isotopic ratios are found to be a regular function of geologic age. The results indicate that: (1) the volcanic rocks in the area are part of a “related” sequence or evolutionary pattern over a time period of 27 Ma; (2) the “evolutionary” pattern goes from an initially enriched source to that of a very depleted source. The shift in isotopic composition appears to reflect the ongoing lining of magma conduits or the decreasing extraction of lower crustal contributions with increasing infiltration of oceanic magma types in an environment where the crust is thinning. Based on the geotectonic development of this area due to the back-arc spreading of the Japan Sea, we identify two different stages: the pre-opening stage (> 15 Ma) and the <b>post-opening</b> stage (< 15 Ma). The volcanic rocks of the pre-opening stage are characterized by an enriched isotopic signature, and those of the <b>post-opening</b> era by a depleted signature. The host rocks of the Kuroko ore deposit lie within this evolutionary trend and contain a substantial amount of continentally derived materials processed through an oceanic environment. In general, we infer that the degree of continental crust involvement is high during the pre-opening stages of a back-arc basin when it is associated with a rifted continental mass...|$|E

40|$|The retail {{geography}} {{literature has}} long recognised {{the importance of}} spatial and catchment analysis to inform decision-making relating to store development. However, less attention has been directed to store development “in practice” and, more specifically, how location research and geographical knowledge is leveraged across the wider retail business – in particular informing the marketing function. Through {{the use of a}} semi-structured interview and focus group methodology involving approximately 40 location planning, property & marketing analysts, we find that while some larger retailers have established close links between store development and marketing functions in the exchange of catchment, customer, competitor and loyalty card data to inform local marketing, product ranging, promotional mailings and <b>post-opening</b> store performance reviews, this tends to be {{the exception rather than the}} rule.

40|$|The {{forecasting}} {{of sales}} from potential store development opportunities is typically supported by quantitative modelling techniques which {{vary in their}} sophistication and practical application between retail firms.

By adopting a qualitative methodology involving interviews with experts, this paper makes an incremental contribution to the literature by detailing how tacit knowledge is synthesised with modelled, codified knowledge to affect the decision-making of senior management in UK-based retail firms. Analysis can also extend to <b>post-opening</b> reviews that offer the opportunity to improve local marketing and product ranging, and from which key lessons can be drawn for subsequent forecasting. Efforts are made by many large retailers to retain expertise and develop institutional ‘memory’ by codifying tacit knowledge, though these processes often rely upon the expertise embedded within broader intra- and extra- firm social networks. Success therefore appears to comprise structured but flexible forecasting routines alongside a focus on learning, continuity and communication within analyst teams...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is the <b>post-opening</b> evaluation of "Attiki Odos Motorway" (AOM) socio-economic impacts, during the period of its operation. The AOM is the peripheral ring-road of the metropolitan Athens-Attica area. To this end, the study estimates an ex post project's "Overall Returns Index" (ORI) based on Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA). Within this framework, selected factors-criteria specified by the interaction mechanism between the motorway's operation and its socio-economic environment are assessed. Then, at each criterion a number of sub-criteria that characterize it are assigned. These are evaluated {{not on the basis of}} subjective judgments - as in the case of the traditional MCA - but on the basis of performance indexes, supported by factual dataset. With regard to the empirical results, the socio-economic returns of the studied motorway, as they occurred from the formula, are high. This means that, on average, the selected sub-criteria and thus the criteria of the formula appear high compliance in our case study. However, the estimates are subject to the limitation of the methodology employed as well as other factors. Clearly, future research on the subject would be of great interest.

Nd and Sr isotopic {{compositions}} {{were determined}} for the Tertiary volcanics from the back-arc {{side of the}} NE Japan arc. Sr isotopes show a linear trend through time from an enriched signature (^ Sr/ ^ Sr = 0. 705437) to a depleted signature (^ Sr/ ^ Sr = 0. 70270). In a complementary fashion, Nd isotopes start at low value (∈_ = - 0. 80) and show a gradual increase (∈_ = 8. 3) with decreasing age. Isotopic change of Nd and Sr from the enriched signature to the depleted one is synchronous {{with the opening of}} the Japan sea at ～ 15 Ma. This synchronism indicates that the opening of the Japan Sea was initiated by the injection of the asthenosphere. During the pre-opening stage, the mantle wedge was composed of a two-layered structure: the sub-continental lithosphere and the underlying asthenosphere. The volcanics of this stage characterized by an enriched isotopic signature were derived from a source with a higher proportion of sub-continental lithosphere. The sub-continintal lithosphere of the back-arc side was thinned by the injection of the depleted asthenosphere, which accelerated the growth of the MORB source within the mantle wedge of the back-arc side and resulted in magma generation with the depleted isotopic signature of Nd and Sr at the <b>post-opening</b> stage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract OnlyA local {{fisheries}} management model employing short-term fisheries closures for rapidly growing species is proliferating across coastal east Africa and Indian Ocean islands. Aiming to improve management and boost incomes, NGOs, international finance institutions, {{and government agencies}} are promoting the technique in artisanal fishing communities. In southwest Madagascar alone, over 130 such closures have been implemented since 2004. To-date, no study has analyzed the closures effects on fisher incomes. This paper uses over 250, 000 datapoints gathered over 8 years to investigate the economic effects of octopus fishery closures in the Velondriake Locally Managed Marine Area in southwest Madagascar. First, we examine village-scale octopus fishery-generated income before, during, and after closures. The villages saw no significant revenue decline during the closure, but do show significantly higher revenues <b>post-opening.</b> Second, we use a stochastic model, parameterized with landings data, to assess whether each closed site was a profitable investment on its own. Of the 37 closures, 28 were profitable and 9 were unprofitable. In 8 of the 9 unprofitable cases, stealing was recorded, and in 6 cases stealing was rampant. Third, we calculate each closures {{internal rate of return}} (IRR), showing that the median monthly IRR in the 28 profitable closures was 67. 7 % (+/- 29. 9 % CI 95). Examining gender bias in closures costs and benefits, we found that women disproportionately stop fishing octopus during closures and men disproportionately fish during openingday derbies. The changes are slight and women's proportion remains above 50 %...|$|E

This study aimed to determine whether the EMW can be efficiently used for the management of patients with mental disorders in terms of length of stay (LOS), admission rate, and re-attendance rate when compared with the medical ward. Methods: This was a retrospective descriptive study. Patients with mental disorders were defined and recruited from the Princess Margaret Hospital during two selected study periods: pre-opening (pre-EMW) and <b>post-opening</b> (post-EMW) of the EMW. All emergency department records of patients with mental disorders within these two periods were reviewed and data of the selected samples were retrieved from different computer databases. Results: The total number of patients with mental disorders was 565 in the pre-EMW period and 404 in the post-EMW period; 214 (37. 9 %) cases were admitted into the medical ward in the pre-EMW period while only 62 (15. 3 %) were admitted into the medical ward in the post-EMW period. The mean LOS in the pre-EMW period was 67. 7 hours. For the post-EMW period, the mean LOS was 32. 3 hours.

40|$|International audienceA {{variety of}} {{processes}} {{have been identified}} as playing a key role in maintenance of hyper-rich tropical forest, among which ecological sorting caused by niche partitioning challenges stochastic dispersal processes. However, demographic responses to spatio-temporal resource variation that could result in biased species distributions are still little studied. In this paper we investigate from two censuses, c. 15 y apart, of a 12 -ha permanent forest sample in French Guiana, how tree recruitment and mortality rates vary among hydrological soil types known to affect species habitat preferences and among ecological guilds related to species light requirement. The results indicate that both recruitment and mortality vary significantly with respect to these factors. While the mean instantaneous mortality and recruitment rates are estimated to 0. 98 and 0. 81 %, respectively, pioneer species, canopy trees and hydromorphic bottomland soils depart significantly from these values. In particular, the pioneers, regenerating either from the soil seed bank or from <b>post-opening</b> seed rain, show faster dynamics than other species. These two guilds harbour probabilities of mortality elevated by a factor of 1. 9 and 3. 2, respectively, and probabilities of recruitment elevated by a factor of 4. 9 and 3. 1, respectively. Conversely, canopy trees show slower dynamics, with probabilities of mortality and recruitment lowered by a mean factor of about 0. 5 with respect to other species.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an effort to apply Elias’s {{thinking}} on social development to the Chinese social situation. At first glance his account of the civilizing process would appear incompatible with this context, in that, after state formation with the Qin and Han dynasties beginning in 221 BC, Chinese civilization remained both stable and highly traditional for well over two millennia. It is argued, however, that closer scrutiny reveals a process that was merely interrupted for a considerable period. The traditional system relied upon a symbiotic relationship between local society and the centre whereby the centre remained relatively small and aloof, not interfering with local social relations, as long as local society provided the required taxes and labour. In this situation the state had the monopolies of both violence and taxation that Elias would look for, but left local society to its own devices primarily because it was already pacified. This self-reinforcing system was enshrined and codified in the Confucian cannon over the course of centuries from the Han dynasty. Central control of the distribution of resources was eventually required to re-start the Chinese civilizing process, for this was the mechanism through which the local social structure would finally be altered. This only happened within the past century as the Chinese people struggled to grapple with their own ‘backwardness’ in the face of incessant Western and Japanese incursions. At this point the old system was toppled and replaced by progressively more aggressive central governments who saw as their most important task the destruction of the traditional social order in the interest of modernization. As the Chinese state consciously and forcibly took control of the distribution of resources at all levels of society, traditional social relations were stretched and warped, and the Chinese civilizing process re-commenced its long-stalled march toward modernization. This has been evidenced both by the dramatic growth in mobility and the rapidly extending chains of interdependence in the form of guanxi connections primarily during the <b>Post-Opening</b> period after 1978...|$|E

About 'Reciprocal Resonances Refracted, Venice 2013 ' Nicola Rae 'This installation involved projecting sound visualisations activated by live audience participation. The program Overtone Analyzer allows interactive sound generation to become visual mark-making through reciprocal sonic play. The idea of using triangles {{as a source of}} interactive sound generation developed through looking at musical instruments played by Venetians during the Renaissance, when Pietro Bembo inhabited the Palazzo. During the Ottoman-Venetian wars at this time, triangles were played by invading Turkish soldiers as part of their percussive Janissary music. The Turkish triangles were made of brass and had rings hanging from their lower bars: but my triangles were made by Percussion Plus, a British percussion manufacturer recommended for their resonant tones. Although not intended to be a sonic ‘invasion’, there were moments when interactivity reached crescendos of sound that were unusual for the Palazzo. Audience participation during the four opening nights was memorable, as were the many conversations that took place. A deaf visitor was delighted {{to be able to see}} the sounds that she was making and so judge different levels of sound visually. Artists who were also musicians activated the installation in particularly inventive ways. Many children responded uninhibitedly to the prospect of sonic experimentation [...] as did so many others. The refraction of the two projector beams was caused by a Perspex cylinder, revolving at two revolutions per minute, which was powered by a mirror ball motor. At regular intervals the Perspex tube refracted the sound visualisations into circular patterns, activating the whole of the inner space. There are aspects of this effect that recall lighthouse beams across water, of which there are many around Venice. Yet this effect was discovered accidentally when experimenting with artist Paul Malone (my husband) in a small mock-up exhibition space within my studio. We tried out a few different refraction ideas yet we both immediately responded to seeing expanding circles of light arcing across the space, due to the refracting effects of the cheapest, extruded acrylic tube that had been roughly sawn. ...|$|E
40|$|A ditadura civil-militar e a luta armada funcionaram como tema e cenário para uma significativa produção cinematográfica no período pós-abertura política, marcando de forma expressiva a cultura nos anos oitenta e noventa. Através de filmes realizados durante estes anos, a memória da luta armada foi sendo construída e disputada. A criação e atuação das organizações armadas de esquerda marcará indelevelmente aquele ano, assim como os anos subseqüentes de uma ditadura que tinha no apoio e cumplicidade de amplos setores sociais, um de seus pilares de sustentação. O fim da ditadura, anunciado em 1979 com a Anistia, e a retomada do regime democrático, marcado pela eleição de Tancredo Neves no Colégio Eleitoral em 1985, trouxeram uma profunda transformação de valores na chamada geração de 68. A ditadura civil- militar, a luta armada, a repressão, o exílio, a Anistia, a volta para o Brasil e a abertura lenta, segura e gradual estão na esteira de um universo de eventos que fornecerão elementos políticos, ideológicos, mas, sobretudo afetivos para aqueles que se debruçam sobre a construção desta memória. Neste sentido, o tema da presente dissertação abarca a análise de dois importantes filmes: Que bom te ver viva (Lúcia Murat, 1989) e O que é isso, companheiro? (Bruno Barreto, 1997). Cada um dos títulos analisados ajuda a explicar, a seu modo, como foi se construindo a memória da luta armada nestas duas décadas, e de que modo esta memória se relaciona com um afeto como o ressentimento, sua faceta reveladora dos caminhos possíveis, impossíveis, pensáveis, impensáveis do lembrar e esquecer. A partir de seus próprios refletores e prismas, cada filme adota uma forma de tratar dos ressentimentos da memória e da memória dos ressentimentos. The civilian-military {{dictatorship}} and {{the armed}} revolt that had an outbreak in Brazil from the year of 1964 on, worked as theme and scenery for a meaningful cinematographic production {{in the period of}} a political <b>post-opening</b> marking in an expressive way the culture of the 80 s and 90 s. Through videos produced throughout these years, the memory of the armed revolt was being built, defended and disputed. The creation and the performance of the leftist armed organization marked that year like any other ever did as well as the following years of the dictatorship that had in the support and alliance of vast social sectors one of its major sponsors. The end of the dictatorship announced in 1979, along with the Amnesty and the reestablishment of the democracy marked by the election of Tancredo Neves in the Electoral College in 1985 provoked a profound transformation of values in the nominated 68 -generation. The civilian-military dictatorship, the armed revolt, the repression, the exile, the Amnesty, the return to Brazil and the slow, secure and gradual opening are fundamental items of this universe of transformations that will supply political and ideological elements, but most significantly sentimental elements for the ones that enjoy the history of the construction of those memories. Based on that, the theme of this paper comprises the analysis of two important movies: Que bom te ver viva (Lúcia Murat, 1989) and O que é isso companheiro? (Bruno Barreto, 1987).
