50|$|Photopsia is the {{presence}} of perceived flashes of light. It is most commonly associated with posterior vitreous detachment, migraine with aura, migraine aura without headache, retinal break or detachment, occipital lobe infarction, and sensory deprivation (ophthalmopathic hallucinations). Vitreous shrinkage or liquefaction, which are the most common causes of photopsia, cause a <b>pull</b> in vitreoretinal <b>attachments,</b> irritating the retina and causing it to discharge electrical impulses. These impulses are interpreted by the brain as 'flashes'.|$|R
40|$|In Xenopus extract meiotic spindles, microtubules slide {{continuously}} {{towards their}} minus ends, {{a process called}} poleward flux. This article discusses recent progress in determining the mechanism of poleward flux, and its functions in spindle organization and generating force on chromosomes. Bipolar organization is required for flux and inhibition of the mitotic kinesin Eg 5 inhibits flux, suggesting the sliding force for flux is generated by Eg 5 pushing anti-parallel microtubules apart. An important function of flux in spindle organization may be to transport minus ends nucleated at chromatin towards the pole. By <b>pulling</b> microtubules through <b>attachment</b> sites at kinetochores, flux may generate poleward force on metaphase chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the major pull factors on residents' {{attachment}} to their own housing community. This examination will lead to better understanding of consumer behavior in the housing market. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through a questionnaire survey and examination of the data was conducted by the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which was supplemented by multiple regression analysis. Findings - It was found that two major factors determine community attachment and hence housing choice. Safety of community determines residents' attachment to their own housing community. Sense of belonging affects residents' willingness to stay. It implies that residents do have strong perception of what the image of their own community is like, and positive management of community can enhance such image and therefore the sense of belonging. Research limitations/implications - The database used is relatively small. Originality/value - Neighborhood attachment has been well-researched, but not much has been done in Hong Kong where most housing communities are high rise-high density. An understanding of the factors <b>pulling</b> residents' <b>attachment</b> towards certain housing community will provide more insight into housing choice decision making. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|P>The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} an original portable device to measure attachment retention of implant overdentures both in the lab and in clinical settings. The device was built with a digital force measurement gauge (Imada) secured to a vertical wheel stand associated with a customized support to hold and position the denture in adjustable angulations. Sixteen matrix and patrix cylindrical stud attachments (Locator (R)) were randomly assigned as in vitro test specimens. Attachment abutments were secured in an implant analogue hung to the digital force gauge or to the load cell of a traction machine used as the gold standard (Instron Universal Testing Machine). Matrices were secured in a denture duplicate attached to the customized support, permitting reproducibility of their position on both <b>pulling</b> devices. <b>Attachment</b> retention in the axial direction was evaluated by measuring maximum dislodging force or peak load during five consecutive linear dislodgments of each attachment on both devices. After a wear simulation, retention was measured again at several time periods. The peak load measurements with the customized Imada device were similar to those obtained with the gold standard Instron machine. These findings suggest that the proposed portable device can provide accurate information on the retentive properties of attachment systems for removable dental prostheses.

40|$|Stroke affects around 750, 000 people {{annually}} with 80 % {{of survivors}} left with unilateral weakness in their extremities. Repetitive hand movement therapy {{is often used}} as a rehabilitation technique to help patients regain dexterity and strength. In order to facilitate this rehabilitation process, a soft exo-muscular robotic upper limb device was designed {{to aid in the}} movement and coordination of upper limb exercises. The device utilizes a cable system to open and close a patient’s hand and elbow. These cables run through a series of guides and <b>pull</b> on <b>attachment</b> points at the fingertips and forearms, emulating muscle tension and generating joint torque. For energy dense actuation, DC electric motors were used to drive pulleys for cable actuation. To increase user comfort and safety, mechanically compliant actuation was added by using clutches with continuously variable slip torque between motor and pulley which could act as a means of mechanical force control. For closed loop control and monitoring of patient progress, a number of sensors were added. Flex and pressure sensors in the fingers can detect patient movement as well as the force being applied to objects and force sensors in the biceps are used to measure the lift force of the users arm. The device also takes input from a custom made surface myoelectric electrode (sEMG) array that measures the myoelectric signal being produced by the user’s muscles to help aid the user in their intended movement. In practice the device will be able to provide a customized rehabilitation experience for each user based on sensor data analyzed by doctors who can adjust the therapy regiment to focus on goals and needs of a specific patient...|$|R
50|$|The parka - {{which is}} a {{particularly}} popular component - {{is characterized by a}} cobra hood (which fits over a combat helmet) with woven nylon drawstring adjustable <b>pulls</b> and an <b>attachment</b> piece that allows fastening of a fur ruff (early models of the parka lacked this attachment piece). There is a two-way, full-front slide fastener to provide full-face protection, leaving only the eyes uncovered. The parka has Raglan shoulders/sleeves, a non-freezing, double-pull zipper with storm flap and seven snap closure, a flap-covered pocket on the left sleeve with hook and loop (Velcro) closure, adjustable hook and loop wrist cuffs, armpit ventilation zippers and double reinforced elbows. A badge/insignia tab with snap is located on the storm flap. There is an interior back ventilation opening, two slash (handwarmer) cargo pockets on the lower front (with extra large flaps and double hook and loop single snap closure on each) and an inside draft skirt (windskirt) with elastic drawcords and barrel-locks at the waist (without pulls). There are also two concealed map pockets at the front zipper with hook and loop closures that can be opened without unzipping the parka.|$|R
40|$|Hormosira banksii is a {{dominant}} intertidal alga characterised by limited dispersal of propagules, {{yet it has}} a broad distribution throughout temperate Australasia. However, the high abundance of beach wrack of H. banksii on sandy beaches along southwest Victoria, the frequency of frond dislodgment and the force required to break it from the substratum remain unknown. Dislodgment of macroalgae {{has been shown to}} influence dispersal processes; therefore, we tested the model that long-distance dispersal of H. banksii is facilitated by weak attachment to the substratum and frequent dislodgment of fertile fronds. We monitored the dislodgment of H. banksii individuals and conducted in situ pull tests to determine the attachment strength of fronds of H. banksii. We further tested whether thallus size or <b>pull</b> direction influenced <b>attachment</b> strength of H. banksii. We found that breakage of vesicles and fronds was a regular event during the survey period and that the mean attachment strength of fronds of H. banksii was weak compared to other intertidal algae. Furthermore, we found that thallus size did not influence the force required to break fronds of H. banksii from the substratum but that the direction that fronds were pulled from the substratum did. We suggest that fronds of H. banksii do drift frequently and that long-distance dispersal is likely to be an important mechanism for the distributional success of this species...|$|R
40|$|The elastic protein titin {{comprises}} a tandem {{array of}} fibronectin type III and immunoglobulin domains, which are structurally similar 7 -strand beta-sandwiches. A proposed mechanism for stretching titin, by sequential denaturation of individual fibronectin type III-immunoglobulin domains {{in response to}} applied tension, is analyzed here quantitatively. The folded domain is approximately 4 nm long, and the unraveled polypeptide can extend to 29 nm, providing a 7 -fold stretch over the relaxed length. Elastic recoil is achieved by refolding of the denatured domains when the force is released. The critical force required to denature a domain is calculated to be 3. 5 - 5 pN, based on a net free energy for denaturation of 7 - 14 kcal/mol, plus 5 kcal/mol to extend the polypeptide (1 cal = 4. 184 J). This force {{is comparable to the}} 2 - to 7 -pN force generated by single myosin or kinesin molecules. The force needed to pull apart a noncovalent protein-protein interface is estimated here to be 10 - 30 pN, implying that titin will stretch internally before the molecule is <b>pulled</b> from its <b>attachment</b> at the Z band. Many extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules, such as fibronectin, contain tandem arrays of fibronectin type III domains. Both single molecules and matrix fibers should have elastic properties similar to titin...|$|R
40|$|The {{mitotic spindle}} is {{essential}} for the segregation of chromosomes during cell division. A combination of microtubule motor and non-motor proteins is involved in generating the forces required for mitotic spindle formation and orientation. Loss of Stu 1, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae member of the CLASP family of microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins, results in spindle collapse, indicating Stu 1 provides an outward spindle-poleseparating force. Similar to Drosophila CLASP, I find that Stu 1 contributes an outward force by promoting kinetochore microtubule length either through tubulin subunit incorporation or stabilization. In stu 1 - 5 cells at the restrictive temperature, spindle poles initially separate prior to collapse, indicating that the subsequent establishment of kinetochore-microtubule <b>attachments</b> <b>pulls</b> the poles inward as a result of shortening kinetochore microtubules. Removal of this inward force by disruption of microtubule attachment with the outer kinetochore mutant ndc 80 - 1 restores pole separation. However, pole separation in stu 1 - 5 ndc 80 - 1 is unstable and fails to reach separation distances observed in ndc 80 - 1 alone, indicating that Stu 1 may also have a stabilization role at the plus ends of polar microtubules. A genome-wide screen for gene deletions that are lethal in combination with the temperature-sensitive stu 1 - 5 allele identified ldb 18 !. ldb 18 ! cells exhibit defects in spindle orientation similar to those caused by a block in the dynein pathway. I show that Ldb 18 is a component of dynactin, a complex required for dynein activity in yeast and mammalian cells. Ldb 18 shares modest sequence and structural homology with the mammalian dynactin component p 24. It interacts with dynactin proteins in two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation assays. In ldb 18 ! cells, the interaction between Nip 100 (p 150 Glued) and Jnm 1 (dynamitin) is diminished while the interaction between Jmn 1 and Arp 1 is not affected. These results indicate that p 24 is required for attachment of the p 150 Glued arm to dynamitin and the remainder of the dynactin complex. A modified Ldb 18 species specifically co-migrates with dynactin complex proteins in sucrose gradients, suggesting regulation is involved in final complex assembly. The genetic interaction of ldb 18 ! with stu 1 - 5 also supports the notion that dynein/dynactin helps to generate a spindle pole separating force...|$|R
