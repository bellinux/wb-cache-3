5000|$|Recent advancements in {{modified}} porous nano-crystalline {{films have}} enabled {{the creation of}} electrochromic display. The single substrate display structure consists of several stacked porous layers printed {{on top of each}} other on a substrate modified with a transparent conductor (such as ITO or PEDOT:PSS). Each printed layer has a specific set of functions. A working electrode consists of a positive porous semiconductor (say Titanium Dioxide, [...] ) with adsorbed chromogens (different chromogens for different colors). These chromogens change color by reduction or oxidation. A <b>passivator</b> is used as the negative of the image to improve electrical performance. The insulator layer serves the purpose of increasing the contrast ratio and separating the working electrode electrically from the counter electrode. The counter electrode provides a high capacitance to counterbalances the charge inserted/extracted on the SEG electrode (and maintain overall device charge neutrality). Carbon is an example of charge reservoir film. A conducting carbon layer is typically used as the conductive back contact for the counter electrode. In the last printing step, the porous monolith structure is overprinted with a liquid or polymer-gel electrolyte, dried, and then may be incorporated into various encapsulation or enclosures, depending on the application requirements. Displays are very thin, typically 30 micrometer, or about 1/3 of a human hair. The device can be switched on by applying an electrical potential to the transparent conducting substrate relative to the conductive carbon layer. This causes a reduction of viologen molecules (coloration) to occur inside the working electrode. By reversing the applied potential or providing a discharge path, the device bleaches. A unique feature of the electrochromic monolith is the relatively low voltage (around 1 Volt) needed to color or bleach the viologens. This can be explained by the small over- potentials needed to drive the electrochemical reduction of the surface adsorbed viologens/chromogens.|$|E

40|$|Breakdowns in {{high voltage}} {{transformers}} are of major concern. It {{is therefore a}} goal to prevent this from happening. Chemical degradation (e. g. oxidation, hydrolysis and corrosion) of the insulation systems and windings and formation of deposits {{are some of the}} most important causes of breakdowns in oil-paper insulated transformers. Several of the methods for studying the oxidation stability of dielectric liquids are time consuming and involve harsh conditions, far from the conditions in the transformer. Some of the methods expose the sample to oxygen flow and uses high temperature. In this work the aim has been to find a quick and suitable method for studying oxidation stability of dielectric liquids under more realistic conditions, with regard to the oxygen and temperature. By using an isothermal microcalorimeter dielectric liquids and model liquids have been studied in terms of the oxidation stability. This work demonstrates that the isothermal microcalorimeter is well suited for the study of oxidative stabilities of dielectric liquids. The experiments were performed at 120, 110 and 90 °C in the isothermal microcalorimeter. The area (integral) below the curves provided by the calorimeter (heat flow vs. time) was found to correlate to the ratio of the volume of the sample over the volume of the head space (amount of available air to the sample). The area below the curves also correlated with the type of oil. It was seen that mineral oil without any additives to stabilise the oil had a much larger area below the curve than the inhibited oil (with additives). 16 unknown dielectric liquids from a Round Robin test were studied with regard to the oxidation stabilities and classified as having high stability, medium, low, very low and extremely low stability by using the area below the curves. Since these samples came from a Round Robin test, the results could be compared with results of investigation of the same unknown liquids by other laboratories that used other methods for determination of the oxidation stability of the dielectric liquids. The results, from the participant laboratories in the Round Robin test that use methods based on the same conditions (observing the onset of the oxidation), agree very well with the results obtained in the isothermal microcalorimeter method, used in this work (based on measuring the integral of the isotherm from the calorimeter). The isothermal microcalorimeter was also used to study the effect of copper (solid), dibenzyl disulphide and a commercial metal <b>passivator</b> on the oxidation of a hydrocarbon liquid (hexadecane as model oil). This was also done with a vegetable oil and mineral oils. The catalytical effect of copper on the oxidation of the hydrocarbon was observed. The catalytical effect was clear in a base oil with no added antioxidants, passivators or deactivators. The effect of DBDS as antioxidant was also evident in these experiments. The catalytical effect of copper was evident only using a certain amount. Increasing the amount of copper beyond this level removed the catalytical effect. This is sometimes referred to as the critical phenomenon in catalysis. Also a metal <b>passivator</b> that is used in transformers for preventing corrosion on the copper has been study to better understand the effect of this <b>passivator.</b> Experiments where copper strips were aged in corrosive oil with and without a metal <b>passivator</b> at 150 °C over different time showed that the <b>passivator</b> has no effect if added to an aged system where the formation of copper-sulphide has started on the metal surface. The decrease in the concentration of sulphur (measured with potentiometric titration) with time is larger in the samples not added the <b>passivator</b> from the start of the experiment, indicating that the sulphur species reacts with the copper. The effect of adding the <b>passivator</b> before ageing was very good. The effect of the metal <b>passivator</b> Irgamet 39 (I 39) may be reduced by possible reaction with oxidation products in an aged oil. Experiments where the <b>passivator</b> was studied were also performed. The change in the concentration (measured with UV-Vis spectrophotometer) of the I 39 when heating the solution with the I 39 in presence of a copper coupon was measured. The adsorption of the <b>passivator</b> on the copper appeared to increase with increasing temperature. The adsorption of the metal <b>passivator</b> on copper was also studied using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) with copper. This gave an indication of the adsorption of a monolayer and multilayers on the copper. The results showed that the adsorption is dependent on the solvent.

40|$|Corrosion {{of copper}} {{conductors}} in mineral oil insulated power transformers {{is a well-known}} problem in electrical power management and distribution worldwide. Recently, some corrosive compounds containing sulfur (e. g. DBDS, dibenzyl disulfide) have been identified {{to play an important}} role in this process. A common strategy to limit corrosion, either as precaution or remedy, is the addition of a <b>passivator</b> (Irgamet 39 ™, I 39 ™) in the oil, with a recommended concentration of 100 ppm to protect the surface of conductors from chemical attack from corrosive oil components. In this study, samples of naturally non-corrosive oil with different concentrations of I 39 ™ are used to treat copper surfaces that are aged under inert atmosphere and analyzed with X-ray Photoelectron (XPS) to assess directly the effective amount of <b>passivator</b> covering the surface of metal and its dependence on the original concentration in oil.

40|$|Abstract: Based on {{electrical}} and chemical analysis in oils of some fault transformers in Shenzhen, it {{indicates that the}} corrosive sulfur contained in insulating oils may cause faults. Corrosive sulfur would react to copper wire and engender Cu 2 S during the operation of transformer.

40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{significant}} volume {{of research has}} been undertaken {{in order to understand}} the recent failures in oil insulated power apparatus due to deposition of copper sulphide on the conductors and in the insulation paper. Dibenzyl Disulfide (DBDS) has been found to be the leading corrosive sulphur compound in the insulation oil [1]. The process of copper sulphide formation and the deposition in the paper is still being investigated, but a recently proposed method seems to be gaining some confidence [1]. This method suggests a two-step process; initially the DBDS and some oil soluble copper complexes are formed. Secondly the copper complexes are absorbed in the paper insulation, where they then decompose into copper sulphide [2]. The most commonly used mitigating technique for corrosive sulphur contaminated oil is passivation, normally using Irgamet 39 or 1, 2, 3 -benzotriazole (BTA). The <b>passivator</b> is diluted into the oil to a concentration of around 100 ppm, where it then reacts with the copper conductors to form a complex layer around the copper, preventing it from interacting with DBDS compounds and forming copper sulphide. This research project will investigate the electrical properties of HV transformers which have tested positive for corrosive sulphur, and the evolution of those properties as the asset degrades due to sulphur corrosion. Parallel to this the long term properties of transformers with passivated insulation oil will be analysed {{in order to understand the}} <b>passivator</b> stability and whether it is necessary to keep adding the <b>passivator</b> to sustain its performance. Condition monitoring techniques under investigation will include dielectric spectroscopy, frequency response analysis, recovery voltage method (aka interfacial polarisation) amongst others. Partial discharge techniques will not be investigated, as the voltage between the coil plates is low and therefore it will not contribute significantly to the overall insulation breakdown, in corrosive oil related faults [3].

30|$|Further {{improvement}} in protective performance may {{be achieved by}} combining inorganic <b>passivator</b> with organic ligands that could form complexes with the metal ions. The mechanism of protective activity of complexing type inhibitors for acidic medium has been proposed and extensively studied {{over the last decade}} [6, 7]. In such systems, protective layers are formed as a result of formation of the slightly soluble complexes of added organic ligands and the metal cations. Deposition of such compounds leads to the formation of the phase metalorganic layers on the metal surface and subsequent decrease in corrosion rate. Thus, application of complexing type inhibitors allows one to implement in situ surface modification for obtaining hybrid protective and functional coatings.|$|E
25|$|Normally the anode foil {{is covered}} by the {{dielectric}} aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layer, which protects the base aluminum metal against the aggressiveness of aqueous alkali solutions. However, some impurities or weak points in the oxide layer offer the possibility for water-driven anodic corrosion that forms aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3). In e-caps using an alkaline electrolyte this aluminum hydroxide will not be transformed into the desired stable form of aluminum oxide. The weak point remains and the anodic corrosion is ongoing. This corrosive process can be interrupted by protective substances in the electrolyte known as inhibitors or <b>passivators.</b> Inhibitors—such as chromates, phosphates, silicates, nitrates, fluorides, benzoates, soluble oils, and certain other chemicals—can reduce the anodic and cathodic corrosion reactions. However, if inhibitors are used in an insufficient amount, they tend to increase pitting.|$|R
30|$|The {{protection}} {{mechanism of}} {{certain types of}} corrosion inhibitors {{is based on the}} formation of the phase protective layers on the metal surface. Among them, one may list the inorganic <b>passivators</b> that facilitate the formation of the dense oxide or salt protective films and complexing type inhibitors that are forming phase metalorganic layers. The mechanism of protective activity of the complexing type inhibitors consists in the formation of slightly soluble complexes of organic ligands with the metal ions. Deposition of such compounds on the metal surface in form of the phase layers leads to the gradual decrease in corrosion rate thus providing the efficient anticorrosive protection. The crucial parameters for ensuring high protective efficiency of the complexing type inhibitors are the high stability and low solubility of complexes with the cations of the metal being protected [6, 7].|$|R
30|$|Liquid-phase inhibitors can {{be further}} divided into three subtypes that are anodic, {{cathodic}} and mixed inhibitors. Anodic inhibitors are those inhibitors that prevent corrosion by forming a protective layer of oxide film on the metal surface. They are also known as <b>passivators,</b> and these inhibitors alter the anodic reactions in the cell [61]. The process of controlling corrosion either by decreasing the reduction rate or by precipitating selective areas of cathodic region (cathodic preceptors) are termed as cathodic inhibitors. In simple words, we can also describe cathodic inhibitors as the chemical compounds that can decrease the corrosion rate of a metal or an alloy, when added to a certain liquid or gas [58, 59, 60, 61, 62]. The compounds which are neither anodic nor cathodic, i.e. compounds which show the characteristics of both anodic and cathodic inhibitors are termed as mixed inhibitors. On an average 80 % organic compounds are mixed inhibitors. They protect metal {{by the process of}} physical adsorption, chemisorption and film formation. They also reduce the cathodic and anodic reactions to work [58, 59].|$|R

A comparison of the reported diffusion coefficients of cyanide ions and dissolved oxygen with the values based on the Levich plots of reported rates reveals the rate-controlling stoichiometric M/CN or M/O 2 molar ratios. The difference between some of these ratios and the generally accepted ratios of M/CN = 1 / 2 and M/O 2 = 1 / 0. 5 or 1 / 0. 25 based on the formation of M(CN) 2 −, H 2 O 2 or OH− in the overall cyanidation reaction is attributed to the oxidation of cyanide to cyanate and passivation due to the formation of gold hydroxides/oxides. The alloyed or dissolved silver and lead eliminate passivation due to the involvement of mixed hydroxo–cyano complexes of silver and lead ions in the surface reaction. Gold dissolution by oxygen in cyanide-rich solutions is limited by oxygen diffusion, but enhanced by the presence of a low concentration of sodium sulfide due to the involvement of hydrosulfide ion in the surface reaction. However, excess lead or sulfide retards gold cyanidation due to surface blockage by metallic lead, lead hydroxide, or due to passivation by Au 2 S/S. Even low concentrations of hydrosulfide passivate gold–silver alloys due to the formation of Ag 2 S. This can be eliminated by adding stoichiometric quantities of lead(II) to precipitate sulfide as PbS. Large stoichiometric ratios of O 2 /M for the cyanidation of graphite coated gold appears to be a result of the enhanced oxidation of cyanide by oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, leading to a cyanide deficiency at the surface and passivation of gold by hydroxide/oxide. The presence of excess cyanide or lead(II) does not override this effect...|$|R
40|$|SODIUM {{molybdate}} is a passivating inhibitor (<b>passivator)</b> {{which can}} inhibit the corrosion of steels in neutral or near-neutral aqueous-environment solutions {{in the presence}} of dissolved oxygen. Because of its non-toxic character, molybdate-based inhibitors are considered a good alternative for inhibiting the corrosion of steels in the cooling towers used in refineries and chemical plants. In this paper, the corrosion behaviour of molybdate used alone or in combination with other chemicals was studied by using electrochemical techniques and weight-loss tests. The results indicate that only a few parts per million (ppm) of molybdate are needed to passivate the surface of steel in aerated pure water. However, {{in the presence of}} corrosive ions, it is necessary to add a much larger quantity of molybdate in order to achieve the same inhibitory efficiency as in the pure-water system. The corrosion-inhibition efficacy and cost-effectiveness can be improved by a synergistic formulation of silicate and molybdate. The optimum ratio for the molybdate/silicate concentration was found to be 1 : 4...|$|E
40|$|Background: A biosurfactant {{produced}} by Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultivated in a low-cost medium formulated with 2. 5 % vegetable oil refinery residue and 2. 5 % {{corn steep liquor}} and distilled water was employed to stabilize silver nanoparticles in the liquid phase. The particles were initially synthesized using NaBH 4 as reducing agent in biosurfactant reverse micelles and were extracted from the micellar solution to disperse in heptane. Results: A silver particle size {{in the range of}} 1. 13  nm was observed. The UV–vis absorption spectra proposed that silver nanoparticles could be formed in the reverse micelles and relatively stabilized for at least 3  months without <b>passivator</b> addition. The Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) shows that the silver nanoparticles are of spherical form and relatively uniform. Conclusions: This process provided a simpler route for nanoparticle synthesis compared to existing systems using whole organisms or partially purified biological extracts, showing that the low-cost biosurfactant can be used for nanoparticle synthesis as a non-toxic and biodegradable stabilizing agent...|$|E
40|$|We compare solvent {{treatments}} using fluorinated alcohol (2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5 -octafluoro- 1 -pentanol) and ethanol {{in improving}} the efficiency of a polymer organic light-emitting diode (OLED) by spin coating the solvent {{on top of the}} emissive layer. The presence of fluorinated alcohol is confirmed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electron current is found to be significantly enhanced following solvent treatment while the hole current remains the same. The solvent treatment by fluorinated alcohol on top of a 'super-yellow' poly-(p-phenylenevinylene) (SY-PPV) based OLED results in efficiency as high as 19. 2 lm W− 1 (20. 9 cd A− 1) at a brightness of 1000 cd m− 2. The improvement of device efficiency through the use of fluorinated alcohol treatment can be attributed to its large dipole, which lowers the electron injection barrier. This work also suggests that fluorinated alcohol might be a better trap <b>passivator</b> for electrons than ethanol...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of Li+ ions on the corrosion behaviour of the Al-Li alloy 8090 -T 851 and of commercially pure aluminium in aqueous solutions at pH 12 was studied by {{weight loss and}} electrochemical polarisation methods. The inhibiting role of Li+ was concentration dependent, corrosion rate decreasing lineally with log[Li+] in the concentration range 10 (- 4) - 10 (- 1) mol L(- 1). A change from general to pitting corrosion was evident from scanning election microscopy studies. Polarisation studies revealed that Li+ primarily acts as an anodic inhibitor (<b>passivator).</b> Passive film formation and stability also become more feasible with increasing Li+ concentration. Fitting potential was dependent on the Cl- ion concentration in the solution. Both materials were affected similarly {{by the presence of}} Li+ ions, the corrosion rate of the alloy being slightly lower. This is attributed to the lithium in the alloy acting as a source of lithium for passive film formation. (C) 1995 The Institute of Materials...|$|E
40|$|Oil-impregnated {{paper is}} widely used in power {{transmission}} equipment as a reliable insulation. However, copper sulphide deposition on oil-paper insulation can lead to insulation failures in power transformers. This paper presents the influences of copper sulfur corrosion and copper sulphide deposition on copper wires and oil-paper insulation in power transformers. Thermal aging tests of paper-wrapped copper wires and bare copper wires in insulating oil were carried out at 130 °C and 150 °C in laboratory. The corrosive characteristics of paper-wrapped copper wires and bare copper wires were analyzed. Dielectric properties of insulation paper and insulating oil were also analyzed {{at different stages of}} the thermal aging tests using a broadband dielectric spectrometer. Experiments and analysis results show that copper sulfide deposition on surfaces of copper wires and insulation paper changes the surface structures of copper wires and insulation paper. Copper sulfur corrosion changes the dielectric properties of oil-paper insulation, and the copper sulfide deposition greatly reduces the electrical breakdown strength of oil-paper insulation. Metal <b>passivator</b> is capable of preventing copper wires from sulfur corrosion. The experimental results are helpful for investigations for fault diagnosis of internal insulation in power transformers...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{wastewater}} is {{discharged from}} industries and associated processes utilizing water. Industrial water cooling systems generated large amount wastewater. Industrial water cooling systems produce waste such as silt, heat, biocide and slimes. The problems {{need to be}} controlled or eliminated are at interferes with heat, {{commonly referred to as}} deposits and deterioration of the water-contacted equipment, referred to as corrosion. Therefore, this research is carried out to overcome this problem by determine the behavior of wastewater from industrial water cooling systems and determine the influence of concentration of Acid Hydrochloric in water cooling systems during Passivation process. The parameters considered based on APHA method in Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater (2005) are including Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Organic Carbon (TOC), pH, Turbidity, Heavy Metals (Iron, Lead, Copper, Nitrate and Nickel). The study of behavior of wastewater from industrial water cooling systems will be taken place at behind the block W, Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Campus Gambang, Pahang Darul Makmur. The results show that all parameters except lead are recorded to be over than standard that have been use for comparison purpose such as the highest concentration of iron recorded that 3012 mg/L but the standard is 5 mg/L. As a conclusion, this effluent need proper treatment before been discharge because majority of parameters over than standard propose. According to study of concentration of Acid Hydrochloric (HCl) can affect the efficiency of passivation for Carbon Steel pipe. For concentration HCl 2 %, <b>passivator</b> needs to increase from 0. 1 % to 1. 0 % and pH also not exceed to alkali conditions or not in range 10 - 12 for effective passivation...|$|E
