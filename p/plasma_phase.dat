40|$|In {{this paper}} the Gribov gap {{equation}} at finite temperature is analyzed. The solutions {{of the gap}} equation (which depend explicitly on the temperature) determine {{the structure of the}} gluon propagator within the semi-classical Gribov approach. The present analysis is consistent with the standard confinement scenario for low temperatures, while for high enough temperatures, deconfinement takes place and a free gluon propagator is obtained. It also suggests the presence of the so-called semi-quark-gluon-plasma phase in between the confined and quark-gluon <b>plasma</b> <b>phases.</b> Comment: 22 pages, 9 figures.

The 2 D nonlinear sigma model has an instanton (or skyrmion) solution which describes an excitation of spin-vortex type. Quantum fluctuations of instantons are reduced to the study of the Coulomb gas, and the gas of instantons of the 2 D nonlinear sigma model is in the <b>plasma</b> <b>phase.</b> We generalize this picture of instanton gas to the (2 + 1) D nonlinear sigma model.

In the deconfined nuclear medium, bound states with colour degrees of freedom are allowed to exist. Using holographic approach, the binding energy and the screening length of the multiquarks can be calculated. Using the deconfined Sakai-Sugimoto model, the phase diagram of the multiquark phase, the vacuum phase, and the chiral-symmetric quark-gluon plasma can be obtained. Then we review the magnetic properties of the multiquarks and their phase diagrams. The multiquark phase is compared with the pure pion gradient, the magnetized vacuum, and the chiral-symmetric quark-gluon <b>plasma</b> <b>phases.</b> For moderate temperature and sufficiently large density at a fixed magnetic field, the mixed phase of multiquark and pion gradient is the most energetically preferred phase...|$|R

40|$|X-ray {{data of the}} Centaurus cluster, {{obtained}} with XMM-Newton for 45 ksec, were analyzed. Deprojected EPIC spectra from concentric thin shell regions were reproduced equally well by a single-phase plasma emission model, or by a two-phase model developed by ASCA, both incorporating cool (1. 7 – 2. 0 keV) and hot (∼ 4 keV) plasma temperatures. However, EPIC spectra with higher statistics, accumulated over 3 -dimentional thick shell regions, were reproduced better by the two-phase model than by the singe-phase one. Therefore, hot and cool <b>plasma</b> <b>phases</b> are inferred to co-exist in the cluster core region within ∼ 70 kpc. The iron and silicon abundances of the plasma were reconfirmed to increase significantly towards the center, while that of oxygen was consistent with being radially constant.
