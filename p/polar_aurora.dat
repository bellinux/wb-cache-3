He became amanuensis at the same university in 1955, docent of physics in 1957, and was appointed professor of experimental physics from 1 April 1964. He obtained a Ph.D. from the University of Oslo in 1961 for six dissertations concerning topics within cosmic radiation. His initial academic area was cosmic radiation, but in 1962 he started researching X-ray phenomena brought forth by electron bombardment of the upper atmosphere in the zone of the <b>polar</b> <b>aurora.</b> He became internationally known for his balloon experiments at the Physics Institute at the University of Bergen, and initiated a cooperation with the Max Planck Institute of West Germany in the early 1960s.

Rather, every case history has to be considered independently. It is possible, however, to approach the problem from an interdisciplinary viewpoint, and to attempt to make an instant modelling of the electric currents that flow in the ionosphere and magnetosphere above the area of aeromagnetic prospecting. A few relevant previous such examples are discussed (such as Akasofu's inference on magnetospheric substorms derived by means of <b>polar</b> <b>auroras,</b> or the presently unfashionable Svalgaard vortex by means of the observed geomagnetic field and dealing with the pattern of the electric field within the magnetosphere, or the Sun-aligned auroral arcs inside the oval that are monitored by satellite, or, perhaps, the luminosity curve of <b>polar</b> <b>auroras).</b> It appears likely that some substantial achievement will be attained altogether with the progress in the understanding of the general pattern of a few typical recurrent configurations over the polar caps, in terms of a multidisciplinary input from different observations, either by ground-based observatories, or by space platforms...|$|R
5000|$|Over Earth's equator, the {{magnetic}} field lines become almost horizontal, then return to reconnect at high latitudes. However, at high altitudes, {{the magnetic}} field is significantly distorted by the solar wind and its solar magnetic field. On the dayside of Earth, {{the magnetic field}} is significantly compressed by the solar wind to a distance of approximately 65,000 km. Earth's bow shock is about 17 km thick and located about 90,000 km from Earth. The magnetopause exists {{at a distance of}} several hundred kilometers above Earth's surface. Earth's magnetopause has been compared to a sieve because it allows solar wind particles to enter. Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities occur when large swirls of plasma travel {{along the edge of the}} magnetosphere at a different velocity from the magnetosphere, causing the plasma to slip past. This results in magnetic reconnection, and as the magnetic field lines break and reconnect, solar wind particles are able to enter the magnetosphere. On Earth's nightside, the magnetic field extends in the magnetotail, which lengthwise exceeds 6,300,000 km. Earth's magnetotail is the primary source of the <b>polar</b> <b>aurora.</b> Also, NASA scientists have suggested that Earth's magnetotail might cause [...] "dust storms" [...] on the Moon by creating a potential difference between the day side and the night side.|$|E

Ganymede's internal magnetic field carves a cavity inside Jupiter's magnetosphere with a diameter of approximately two Ganymede diameters, creating a mini-magnetosphere within Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ganymede's magnetic field diverts the co-rotating plasma flow around its magnetosphere. It also protects the moon's equatorial regions, where the field lines are closed, from energetic particles.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a mechanism for}} charge separation in the geomagnetically trapped radiation which may account for some observed phenomena associated with the <b>polar</b> <b>aurora</b> and the electrojet current systems. The following development is proposed: given that there exist eastward or westward longitudinal gradients in the geomagnetic field resulting from distortion of the geomagnetic field by solar streams, if the trapped radiation is adiabatic in character, radial drift separation {{of positive and negative}} charged particles must occur. It follows that, for bounded or irregular distributions of plasma number density in such an adiabatic - drift region, electric fields will arise. The origin of such electric fields will not arrest the drift separation of the charged particles, but will contribute to exponential growth of irregularities in the trapped plasma density. An adiabatic acceleration mechanism is described, which is based on incorporating the electrostatic energy of the particle in the energy function for the particle. Direct consequences of polarization of the geomagnetically trapped radiation will be the polar electrojet current systems and the <b>polar</b> <b>aurora...</b>|$|E

The glow followed magnetic field lines (lines of force) and converged near the magnetic poles of the terrella.

The {{acceleration}} of electrons at 1 - 10 keV energies {{is the cause}} of the <b>polar</b> <b>aurora</b> displays, and an important factor of magnetic energy transfer from the solar wind to the Earth.

40|$|Observations of Saturn's {{infrared}} aurorae {{have shown}} {{that in addition to}} the main auroral oval, which is believed {{to be associated with the}} solar wind, there are significant polar emissions. Ground-based infrared observations of Saturn have been able to show that there is a general level of raised emission across the entire polar region, in a similar way to that seen at Jupiter. However, with direct observations of the aurora made from orbit around Saturn by the Cassini-VIMS instrument, this aurora was shown to be more than a relative generalised brightening in the infrared. Instead, a unique auroral feature was observed to occur, appearing as a large region of bright polar emission, positioned poleward of 82 degrees latitude. This Bright <b>Polar</b> <b>Aurora</b> emission is significantly different from the recently observed subrotating Q-branch auroral emission seen in both the ultraviolet and infrared, as it is separated from the main auroral oval by a region of low emission. This effectively produces a cap of bright aurora inside the main auroral oval, surrounded by a dark ring that separates the two aurorae. Here, we take a more detailed look at this cap of emission and examine the way the auroral feature develops with time. Bright <b>Polar</b> <b>Aurora</b> emission has been observed in two separate VIMS images. A more detailed analysis of the polar emission shows that each of these images in fact differs in structure; the first has auroral emission across the whole polar cap > 82 degrees, but within the second the emission is concentrated on the dusk side. While the dramatic in-filling of the polar cap is not seen within any UV observations, the Hubble Space Telescope has observed transitory duskward auroral features within the polar cap, in a similar location to the duskward feature seen in the infrared. Using ground-based infrared observations, which allow a Bright <b>Polar</b> <b>Aurora</b> event to be broken into shorter timescale steps, it is possible analyse the progression of the infrared auroral emission with time, connecting the morphology seen within the two VIMS images with those in the ultraviolet.

2500|$|The {{previous}} process excites {{more and}} more atoms because a de-excitation obeys Einstein’s law of coherent interactions: Variation dI of radiance I of a light beam along a path dx is dI=BIdx, [...] where B is Einstein amplification coefficient which depends on medium. [...] I is the modulus of Poynting vector of field, absorption occurs for an opposed vector, which corresponds to a change of sign of B. Factor I in this formula shows that intense rays are more amplified than weak ones (competition of modes). Emission of a flare requires a sufficient radiance I provided by random zero point field. After emission of a flare, weak B increases by pumping while I remains close to zero: De-excitation by a coherent emission involves stochastic parameters of zero point field, as observed close to quasars (and in <b>polar</b> <b>auroras).</b>|$|R
2500|$|Saturn has bright <b>polar</b> <b>aurorae,</b> {{which have}} been {{observed}} in the ultraviolet, visible and near infrared light. The aurorae usually look like bright continuous circles (ovals) surrounding the poles of the planet.

From time to time either aurorae can assume a spiral shape instead of oval. In this case it begins near midnight at a latitude of around 80°, then its latitude decreases to as low as 70° as it continues into the dawn and day sectors (counterclockwise). In the dusk sector the auroral latitude increases again, although when it returns to the night sector it still has a relatively low latitude and does not connect to the brighter dawn part.|$|R
