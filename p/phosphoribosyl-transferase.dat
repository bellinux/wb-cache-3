We have cloned a full-length cDNA for HPRT Ann Arbor and determined its complete nucleotide sequence. A single nucleotide change (T→G) at nucleotide position 396 has been identified.

These properties indicated that the antibiotic interferes with the conversion of quinolinic acid to nicotinate ribonucleotide by the enzyme quinolinate <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase.</b> However, the activity of a purified preparation of this enzyme derived from a Pseudomonas strain was not impaired by the antibiotic. This suggested that, in B. subtilis, melinacidin interferes with a reaction which occurs before the formation of quinolinic acid in the biosynthetic pathway leading to nicotinic acid.

We investigated the clonal origin of pituitary tumors using X-linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms at the phosphoglycerate kinase and hypoxanthine <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase</b> genes. Restriction enzymes were used to distinguish maternal and paternal X-chromosomes, and combined with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme to analyze allelic X-inactivation patterns in six pituitary adenomas.

In order for ribavirin {{to be active}} as an inhibitor of the dehydrogenase, this synthetic nucleoside must be phosphorylated. The effect of ribavirin on purine excretion has been determined with a normal lymphoblast line, and with lymphoblast lines deficient in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (IMP:pyrophosphate <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase,</b> EC 2. 4. 2. 8), in adenosine kinase (ATP:adenosine 5 '-phosphotransferase, EC 2. 7. 1. 20), and in both hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase and adenosine kinase.

40|$|We {{examined}} DNA double-strand-break-induced {{mutations in}} the endogenous adenine <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase</b> (APRT) gene in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells after exposure to restriction endonucleases. PvuII, EcoRV, and StuI, {{all of which}} produce blunt-end DNA double-strand breaks, were electroporated into CHO-AT 3 - 2 cells hemizygous at the APRT locus. Colonies of viable cells containing mutations at APRT were expanded, and the mutations that occurred during break repair were analyzed at the DNA sequence level. Restriction enzyme-induced mutations consisted of small deletions of 1 to 36 bp, insertions, and combinations of insertions and deletions at the cleavage sites. Most of the small deletions involved overlaps of one to four complementary bases at the recombination junctions. Southern blot analysis revealed more complex mutations, suggesting translocation, inversion, or insertion of larger chromosomal fragments. These results indicate that blunt-end DNA double-strand breaks can induce illegitimate (nonhomologous) recombination in mammalian chromosomes and that they {{play an important role}} in mutagenesis...|$|E
40|$|The enzymes {{involved}} in tryptophan biosynthesis have been analyzed {{in a variety}} of fungal strains and a few other microorganisms. The same five biosynthetic reactions occur in all organisms tested, but differences have been found in the stability requirements for the enzymes, in their differential precipitation with ammonium sulfate, and in their sedimentation pattern after zone centrifugation. Based on the sedimentation behavior of anthranilate synthetase, <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase,</b> N-(5 ′-phosphoribosyl) -anthranilate isomerase, and indole- 3 -glycerophosphate synthetase, five different patterns of enzyme association could be recognized. The distribution of these patterns was used to evaluate several specific features of proposed phylogenetic relationships in the fungi. A closer relationship between Chytridiales and Aspergillales is postulated, eliminating the Zygomycetes and the Endomycetales as probable intermediates; the latter groups are considered to be sidelines. The data support the idea of a polyphyletic origin of the phycomycetes and suggest that anascosporogenous yeasts tested are related to the heterobasidiomycetes rather than to the Endomycetales. A possible sequence of changes leading to the various patterns of organization of the tryptophan pathway during the course of evolution is also proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of sites {{that can be}} methylated was analyzed in the Chinese hamster adenine <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase</b> (aprt) gene and the patterns of methylation of this gene and the mouse dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene were studied by using CpG restriction enzymes. Both genes {{were found to be}} unmethylated completely at their 5 '-end region and methylated heavily {{throughout the rest of the}} gene. Because the hamster aprt gene can be inhibited by DNA methylation in vivo, the results suggest that 5 ' undermethylation of this gene may be a necessary condition for its expression. The pattern of methylation of each of these two genes was similar in sperm and all other somatic tissue DNAs. This is in contrast to many tissue-specific genes that were found to be highly methylated in sperm DNA and undermethylated in the tissue in which they are expressed. This result is consistent with the fact that both aprt and dhfr are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of nucleotides and therefore expected to be synthesized in all cells...|$|E

Recovered hybrid cells produced the chick hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase exclusively, {{as demonstrated by}} electrophoretic mobility and immunoprecipitation tests, even though no chick chromosomes or chick cell-surface antigens could be identified in the hybrids. Surprisingly, {{the expression of the}} chick hypoxanthine <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase</b> activity in the mouse/chick hybrids required the presence of aminopterin in the growth medium; in its absence, enzyme synthesis decreased markedly. Because of the rapid and reversible modulation of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase activity, the hybrid cells could proliferate equally well in media containing hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine or 8 -azaguanine. Cellular selection was definitely ruled out as a possible cause. These results confirm previous reports that specific genetic information can be selectively transferred from one cell to another of a distant species. Furthermore, they demonstrate that an avian gene, whose activity is normally expressed constitutively, can become facultative when integrated into a mammalian cell. This seems to be the first instance where heterologous gene activity {{has been shown to be}} reversibly modulated in hybrid cells...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{excision}} repair modulates the mutagenic effect of many genotoxic agents. The recently observed strand specificity for removal of UV-induced cyclobutane dimers from actively transcribed genes in mammalian cells could influence {{the nature and}} distribution of mutations in a particular gene. To investigate this, we have analyzed UV-induced DNA repair and mutagenesis in the same gene, i. e. the hypoxanthine <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase</b> (hprt) gene. In 23 hprt mutants from V 79 Chinese hamster cells induced by 2 J/m 2 UV we found a strong strand bias for mutation induction: assuming that pre-mutagenic lesions occur at dipyrimidine sequences, 85 % of the mutations {{could be attributed to}} lesions in the nontranscribed strand. Analysis of DNA repair in the hprt gene revealed that more than 90 % of the cyclobutane dimers were removed from the transcribed strand within 8 hours after irradiation with 10 J/m 2 UV, whereas virtually no dimer removal could be detected from the nontranscribed strand even up to 24 hr after UV. These data present the first proof that strand specific repair of DNA lesions in an expressed mammalian gene is associated with a strand specificity for mutation induction...|$|E

A wide variation in HKG expression existed during the aging process, and HPRT was identified as the most stable HKG in rat liver aging. When Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase gene expression was normalized to HPRT, there was no detectable difference between young and old rats; however, a significant difference was seen when it was normalized to UBC. The variation of UBC caused the misinterpretation of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase expression. Catalase expression was significantly decreased, whereas glutathione peroxidase expression was not altered with age. We demonstrated that HPRT was an appropriate HKG, validation of HKGs was vital for accurate quantification, and decreased catalase expression might {{be involved in the}} decline of antioxidant defenses during rat liver aging.

We present evidence that the hypoxan-thine-induced arrest is dependent on uptake and salvage of hy-poxanthine and depletion of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate(PRPP) levels. Hypoxanthine uptake increased during the 2 -cell stage and was augmented by glucose. HPLC analysis of[' 14 C]hypoxanthine metabolism revealed that hypoxanthine was salvaged and converted to ATP and guanosine triphosphate(GTP), with a shift to more guanyl nucleotide production at the 3 - to 4 -cell stage. In embryos from mice with a null mutation for the salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase,</b> hypoxanthine did not block development nor was it {{taken up by the}} embryos. Glucose, which is required for the hypoxanthine-induced arrest, produced a 5. 3 -fold increase in PRPP levels at the 2 -cell stage, which was eliminated by hypo-xanthine. We conclude that metabolism of hypoxanthine to nu-cleotides mediates its inhibitory action on preimplantation mouse embryos via negative feedback on PRPP synthetase, ul-timately resulting in decreased PRPP availability and arrest of other PRPP-dependent pathways. Finally, reversal of the block by EDTA and cAMP-elevating agents may be mediated by alter-ations in hypoxanthine or glucose uptake, or by changes in the relative metabolism of hypoxanthine...|$|E

Micromixing significantly decreased the number of qPCR cycles to detect cDNA representing mRNA for hypoxanthine <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase</b> (Hprt) and nuclear receptor&# 8211;related 1 (Nurr 1) by ~ 9 and ~ 15 cycles, respectively. The improvement was equivalent to performing RT with 10 - to 100 -fold more cDNA in the absence of micromixing.

Four independent mutants were isolated, all of which were shown to lack uracil <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase</b> (UPRT) activity and harbor transgenes integrated at closely linked loci, suggesting inactivation of the UPRT-encoding gene.

Near isogenic tester strains with different alleles (het- 6 (OR) and het- 6 (PA)) were constructed and used to determine that 80 of 96 escape strains tested were het- 6 (PA), retaining the het- 6 allele found in the normal-sequence LGII position; 16 were het- 6 (OR), retaining the allele in the translocated position. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms in 45 escape strains were examined with probes made from cosmids that spanned the translocated region.

40|$|A new gene {{like the}} alpha-globin gene has been {{identified}} in higher primates at the 3 ' end of the alpha-globin gene cluster. There is some controversy as to whether this gene, theta, is a functional globin gene or a non-functional pseudogene. The high degree of sequence conservation displayed by theta between primates and various mammals, such as horse and rabbit, suggests that this gene is functional in some species. Furthermore, theta encodes a 141 -amino-acid polypeptide in sequence similar to alpha-globin and appears to possess functional RNA-processing signals. But the promoter region of theta is unlike the other globin genes because its CCAAT and ATA box sequences are displaced from the coding sequence by the insertion of a 200 -base-pair GC-rich sequence. We demonstrate here the presence of theta-globin messenger RNA in human fetal erythroid tissue, but not in adult erythroid or other non-erythroid tissues. Furthermore, theta-globin mRNA is detectable in significant amounts in a human erythroleukaemic cell line. These results predict that theta-globin protein will {{be found in the}} early stages of human fetal development. Surprisingly, the promoter sequence of theta-globin does not correspond to the CCAAT and ATA box sequences of the gene but rather lies within the adjacent GC-rich sequence, resulting in a heterogeneous series of mRNA 5 ' ends 50 - 10 base pairs to 5 ' of the initiation codon. This type of promoter is reminiscent of that found in housekeeping genes such as adenine deaminase and hypoxanthine-guanine <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OMP synthase, EC 2. 4. 2. 10) {{forms the}} UMP {{precursor}} orotidine 5 ′-monophophate (OMP) from orotate and R-D- 5 -phosphoribosyl- 1 -pyrophosphate (PRPP). Here, equilibrium binding, isotope partitioning, and chemical quench studies {{were used to}} determine rate and equilibrium constants for the kinetic mechanism. PRPP bound to two sites per dimer with a KD of 33 íM. Binding of OMP and orotate also occurred to a single class of two sites per dimer, with KD values of 3 and 280 íM, respectively. Pyrophosphate binding to two sites was weak with a KD of 960 íM, and in the presence of bound orotate, its affinity for the first site was enhanced 4 -fold (KD) 230 íM). Preformed EâOMP, EâPRPP, EâPPi, and Eâorotate complexes were trapped as products in isotope partitioning experiments, indicating that each was catalytically competent and confirming a random mechanism. Rapid quench experiments revealed burst kinetics for product formation in both the forward <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase</b> and the reverse pyrophosphorolysis reactions. The steady-state rate in the forward reaction was preceded by a burst (nfwd) 1. 5 /dimer) of at least 300 s- 1. In the pyrophosphorolysis reaction, a burst (nrev) 0. 7 /dimer; k g 300 s- 1) was also noted. These results allowed us to develop a complete kinetic mechanism for OPRTase, in which a rapid phosphoribosyl transfer reaction at equilibrium is followed by a slow step involving release of product.

40|$|During {{the first}} 3 days of postfertilization development, {{there is an}} {{increase}} in the uptake of guanine by preimplantation mouse embryos. The major increase occurs between the 2 -and the 8 - to 16 -cellstages, and a maximum of 0. 115 pmoles/hr/embryo isreached at the early blastocyst stage. Upon entry into the embryo, the guanine is rapidly converted to GMP by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. The GMP is then further phosphorylated to GDP and GTP, and the major intracellular guanine metabolite is GTP. Despite the presence of high activities of guanine deaminase in the embryos, no xanthine or uric acid is found. This is presumably the result of conversion of any xanthine formed to nucleotides. Hypoxanthine-guanine <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase</b> (HGPRT, EC 2. 4. 2. 8), the en-zyme which converts guanine and hypoxan-thine to their respective ribonucleotides, is present in preimplantation mouse embryos and undergoes a marked increase in activity between the second and third day of post-fertilization embryonic development (Ep-stein, 1970). During a study of this enzyme reaction in mouse ova, using [“C]guanine as substrate, a highly radioactive spot with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of guanosine was detected. Subsequent in-vestigation has indicated that the product is xanthine and that the enzyme which pro-duces it, guanine deaminase (EC 3. 5. 4. 3), is present with relatively high activity. The de-tection of this enzyme led to an analysis of the uptake and metabolism of guanine by intact mouse embryos. It was found that despite the higher activity of guanine de-aminase as compared to that of phosphori-‘The work was supported by research grants fro...|$|E

By using a shuttle vector system developed in our laboratory, we have analyzed the sequence specificity of mutations induced in mouse A 9 cells by exposure of the cells to {{a high concentration of}} thymidine. The target for mutagenesis in these studies was the bacterial gpt gene stably integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the mouse cells. Previous studies in this laboratory had generated a large panel of xanthine guanine <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase</b> (EC 2. 4. 2. 22) -negative mutant lines that possess single-base mutations within the gpt coding sequence. This study utilized four xanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-negative mutant lines to assess the frequency of mutation induced by thymidine at guanine residues in four sequence contexts: the 5 ' and 3 ' guanine residues of a GG doublet, the middle guanine residue of a GGG triplet, and the 3 ' guanine residue of a GGGG quartet. The results of this study demonstrate that treatment of cultured cells with a high concentration of thymidine can result in G. C [...] A. T transition mutations that occur preferentially at the 3 ' guanine residue of a run of two or more adjacent guanines. Guanine residues flanked on their 3 ' side by other guanine residues are severalfold less mutable by thymidine than are guanine residues flanked on their 3 ' side by a different base. This study demonstrates a sequence-specific mode for thymidine-induced mutations and suggests implications for mutagenesis in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Chondroprotective agents (CPA) such as glucosamine, {{curcumin}} and diacerein represent potential {{remedies for}} the management of osteoarthritis and several studies have been performed on their effects in-vitro and in-vivo. For the investigation of chondroprotective action on chondrocyte gene expression, quantitative real-time RT-PCR is the method of choice. However, validation of applied normalization strategies represents a crucial and sometimes neglected step in the analysis process. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the expression stability of common reference genes (ACTB, Beta actin; GAPDH, Glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate; B 2 M, Beta- 2 -microglobulin; HPRT 1, Hypoxanthine <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase</b> I; SDHA, Succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A; YWHAZ, Tyrosine 3 -monooxygenase/tryptophan 5 -monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide) under the influence of glucosamine, curcumin and diacerein in the IL- 1 β-stimulated C- 28 /I 2 chondrocyte model, using the geNorm software tool. Results CPA treatment of C- 28 /I 2 chondrocytes significantly affected the expression level of many reference genes (p GAPDH, B 2 M and SDHA in glucosamine treated samples and HPRT 1, GAPDH and B 2 M in curcumin or diacerein treated samples. Interestingly, ACTB {{was one of the most}} variably expressed genes throughout all experiments. Conclusion Our study points out the problem of relying on commonly used reference genes without an accurate validation process. For normalization purposes in gene profiling studies on glucosamine action, the genes GAPDH, B 2 M and SDHA are recommended as single reference genes depending on the expression level of the target gene or more favourably in combination. For experiments with curcumin and diacerein the use of HPRT 1, GAPDH and B 2 M should be considered. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} {{possible}} association of purine enzyme activities with response to azathioprine (AZA) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and their correlation with parameters of disease activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS [...] Lymphocyte activities of hypoxanthine-guanine <b>phosphoribosyl-transferase</b> (HGPRT), adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), {{purine nucleoside phosphorylase}} (PNP) and 5 '-nucleotidase (5 NT), and erythrocyte activities of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) were measured in 14 healthy controls and 36 patients with RA. Eight patients had not previously been treated with AZA. Response to AZA therapy in 28 patients, determined in a prospective trial, was considered good in nine (group 1), insufficient in seven (group 2). In 12 patients AZA was withdrawn because of adverse reactions (group 3). Disease activity parameters were obtained simultaneously with purine enzyme measurements. Purine enzyme levels in the different groups were compared. RESULTS [...] Levels of 5 NT activity were significantly lower in patients with RA than in healthy controls. PNP activity was higher in patients with RA not using prednisone compared with those who did and healthy controls. No clear correlation between purine enzyme levels and disease activity parameters was found. 5 NT activities were significantly higher in group one than in group three (p = 0. 012; alpha = 0. 017), and almost significantly higher than in group two (p = 0. 03; alpha = 0. 017). CONCLUSIONS [...] The results indicate that purine enzyme activities in patients with RA differ from healthy controls, {{are associated with the}} outcome of AZA treatment and seem not to be associated with disease activity.
