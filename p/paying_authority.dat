It differed from MCCs {{in a number}} of important respects: in mandatory inclusion of representatives of local authorities and of the District Judge Bench; in its ownership of property; and in the mechanics of itsfinancing. It consisted of magistrates, at least one of whom had to be a District Judge, and mayoral and other local authority nominees. Not only did it own its courthouses and associated property, but it also acted as a <b>paying</b> <b>authority</b> in its own right. However, it did receive its revenue funding from two different sources and in the same proportions as the MCCs, namely 80% fromthe Lord Chancellor’s Department and 20% from the Corporation of the City of London and the 32 London Boroughs.|$|E
40|$|The University of Malta {{would like}} to {{acknowledge}} its gratitude to National Audit Office for sharing this content in order to enhance the Library's Digital CollectionIn 2013, the Contact Committee of the Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) mandated the Working Group on Structural Funds to carry out an analysis of the types of errors in EU and national public procurement within the Structural Funds Programmes. The types of errors reviewed in this audit correspond to those categorised by the Committee of the Coordination of Funds (COCOF) Note 07 / 0037 / 03, which provides guidelines and parameters for determining financial corrections in cases of non-compliance with the rules on public procurement. The guidelines enable the adoption of a common approach in dealing with cases of irregularities across Member States. This parallel audit was carried out in conjunction with the SAIs of eight Member States, while five other SAIs and the European Court of Auditors acted as observers. This audit focused on errors that were already detected and categorised by the Authorities. The key stakeholders in this regard were the Planning and Priorities Coordination Division, in its role as the Managing Authority (MA); the European Union <b>Paying</b> <b>Authority</b> within the Ministry of Finance, in its role as the Certifying Authority (CA); the Internal Audit and Investigations Department, in its role as the Audit Authority (AA); as well as the European Commission (EC).

A lot, however, still has to be done to complete this institution building: adaptation of programmes to the requirements of the EU regulations set for structural funds, designation of the management <b>authorities</b> and <b>paying</b> <b>authorities,</b> better coordination between the various central state institutions involved in regional policy, inclusion of regions into the national programming process.
