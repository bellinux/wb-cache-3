25|$|ODBC {{is based}} on the device driver model, where the driver encapsulates the logic needed to convert a {{standard}} set of commands and functions into the specific calls required by the underlying system. For instance, a <b>printer</b> <b>driver</b> presents a standard set of printing commands, the API, to applications using the printing system. Calls made to those APIs are converted by the driver into the format used by the actual hardware, say PostScript or PCL.|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of the XPS print path is XPSDrv, the XPS-based <b>printer</b> <b>driver</b> which {{includes}} the filter pipeline. It contains a set of filters which are print processing modules and an XML-based configuration file to describe how the filters are loaded. Filters receive the spool file data as input, perform document processing, rendering and PDL post-processing, and then output PDL data for the printer to consume. Filters can perform a single function such as watermarking a page or doing color transformations or they can perform several print processing functions on specific document parts individually or collectively and then convert the spool file to the page description language supported by the printer.|$|E

2500|$|The early Mac OS (simply named [...] "System") {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from many other operating systems {{from the same}} period because it does not use a command line interface; {{it was one of the}} first operating systems to use an entirely graphical user interface or GUI. It consists of two user-visible components: in addition to the system kernel, there is the Finder, an application used for file management that also displays the Desktop. The two files were contained in a folder directory labeled [...] "System Folder", which contained other resource files, like a <b>printer</b> <b>driver,</b> needed to interact with the System.|$|E
2500|$|Google Cloud Print is a Google {{service that}} helps any {{application}} on any device to print on any printer. While the cloud provides virtually any connected device with information access, {{the task of}} [...] "developing and maintaining print subsystems for every combination of hardware and operating system—from desktops to netbooks to mobile devices—simply isn't feasible." [...] The cloud service requires installation {{of a piece of}} software called proxy, as part of the Chrome OS. The proxy registers the printer with the service, manages the print jobs, provides the <b>printer</b> <b>driver</b> functionality, and gives status alerts for each job.|$|E

Several classes were used as [...] "guinea pigs" [...] {{in order to test}} the students' abilities to adapt to Mac OS X Tiger OS interface and assess the laptops' value for use with school activities. The laptops featured all the standard Mac programs as well as having a digital camera built into the top of the screen.

2500|$|ODBC accomplishes DBMS {{independence}} {{by using}} an ODBC driver as a translation layer between the application and the DBMS. The application uses ODBC functions through an ODBC driver manager with which it is linked, and the driver passes the query to the DBMS. An ODBC driver {{can be thought of}} as analogous to a <b>printer</b> <b>driver</b> or other driver, providing a standard set of functions for the application to use, and implementing DBMS-specific functionality. An application that can use ODBC is referred to as [...] "ODBC-compliant". Any ODBC-compliant application can access any DBMS for which a driver is installed. [...] Drivers exist for all major DBMSs, many other data sources like address book systems and Microsoft Excel, and even for text or comma-separated values (CSV) files.|$|E
2500|$|The TeX {{system has}} precise {{knowledge}} of the sizes of all characters and symbols, and using this information, it computes the optimal arrangement of letters per line and lines per page. It then produces a DVI file ("DeVice Independent") containing the final locations of all characters. This dvi file can be printed directly given an appropriate <b>printer</b> <b>driver,</b> {{or it can be}} converted to other formats. Nowadays, pdfTeX is often used, which bypasses DVI generation altogether. The base TeX system understands about 300 commands, called primitives. [...] These low-level commands are rarely used directly by users, and most functionality is provided by format files (predumped memory images of TeX after large macro collections have been loaded). Knuth's original default format, which adds about 600 commands, is Plain TeX. [...] The most widely used format is LaTeX, originally developed by Leslie Lamport, which incorporates document styles for books, letters, slides, etc., and adds support for referencing and automatic numbering of sections and equations. Another widely used format, AMS-TeX, is produced by the American Mathematical Society and provides many more user-friendly commands, which can be altered by journals to fit with their house style. Most of the features of AMS-TeX can be used in LaTeX by using the AMS [...] "packages". This is then referred to as AMS-LaTeX. Other formats include ConTeXt, used primarily for desktop publishing and written mostly by Hans Hagen at Pragma.|$|E

50|$|UniDrv (Universal <b>Printer</b> <b>Driver</b> or Unidriver) is a GDI-based Microsoft Windows {{universal}} <b>printer</b> <b>driver</b> {{and architecture}} for non-PostScript printers.

Unidrv allows {{the creation of a}} printer-specific minidriver {{in the form of a}} GPD (Generic Printer Description) file, similar to a PPD file, which is much simpler than kernel mode driver development. Unidrv was introduced in Windows 2000 and replaced the Raster Device Driver (RASDD) interface used in Windows NT 4.0 and earlier versions.|$|E
