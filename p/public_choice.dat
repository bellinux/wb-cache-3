25|$|Public finance is {{the field}} of {{economics}} that deals with budgeting the revenues and expenditures of a public sector entity, usually government. The subject addresses such matters as tax incidence (who really pays a particular tax), cost-benefit analysis of government programmes, effects on economic efficiency and income distribution {{of different kinds of}} spending and taxes, and fiscal politics. The latter, an aspect of <b>public</b> <b>choice</b> theory, models public-sector behaviour analogously to microeconomics, involving interactions of self-interested voters, politicians, and bureaucrats.|$|E

25|$|Anarcho-capitalism advocates the {{elimination}} of the state in favour of individual sovereignty in a free market. Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism, drawing from Austrian School economics, study of law and economics, and <b>public</b> <b>choice</b> theory. There is a strong current within anarchism which does not believe that anarcho-capitalism can be considered {{to be a part of}} the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalism.|$|E
25|$|Thomond Park {{went through}} a major {{renovation}} in 1999 and in 2006, Munster announced plans to upgrade it. In autumn 2008, the new 26,500 capacity stadium was opened.

The new stadium design was well received and won the <b>Public</b> <b>Choice</b> Award for 2009 from the Irish Architecture Foundation. A long discussion and consultation on the new name concluded with the decision that the name would remain Thomond Park.|$|E
25|$|Acemoglu and Robinson have {{explained}} that their theory is largely {{inspired by the}} work of Douglass North, an American economist, and Barry R. Weingast, an American political scientist. In North and Weingast's paper in 1989, Constitutions and Commitment: The Evolution of Institutions Governing <b>Public</b> <b>Choice</b> in Seventeenth-Century England, they conclude that historical winners shape institutions to protect their own interests. In the case of the Glorious Revolution, the winning merchant class established property rights laws and limited the power of the monarch, which essentially promoted economic growth. Later on, North, Wallis and Weingast call this law and order open access, in their 2009 paper Violence and the Rise of Open-Access Orders. With open access—inclusiveness, equality and diversity—societies are more able to flourish and prosper.|$|E

25|$|A {{long history}} of {{political}} {{lack of interest in}} public transport had by the 2000s left Auckland with substantially underused and underfunded bus and rail systems (by 2006, accounting for only 7% of all morning trips), with research at Griffith University concluding that in the 50-year period from 1955 onwards the Auckland area had engaged {{in some of the most}} pro-automobile transport policies anywhere in the world. This is alleged to have been based not on rational (or indeed <b>public)</b> <b>choice</b> alone, but also due to policy tools being strongly weighed to produce favourable results for road projects when assessing transport spending. The Ministry of Economic Development released a working paper assessing the economic benefits for public transport growth in Auckland and suggested a number of key framework issues may be responsible for the decline in Auckland public transport patronage.|$|E
25|$|High {{voter turnout}} is often {{considered}} to be desirable, though among political scientists and economists specializing in <b>public</b> <b>choice,</b> the issue is still debated. A high turnout is generally seen {{as evidence of the}} legitimacy of the current system. Dictators have often fabricated high turnouts in showcase elections for this purpose. For instance, Saddam Hussein's 2002 plebiscite was claimed to have had 100% participation. Opposition parties sometimes boycott votes they feel are unfair or illegitimate, or if the election is for a government that is considered illegitimate. For example, the Holy See instructed Italian Catholics to boycott national elections for several decades after the creation of the state of Italy. In some countries, there are threats of violence against those who vote, such as during the 2005 Iraq elections, an example of voter suppression. However, some political scientists question the view that high turnout is an implicit endorsement of the system. Mark N. Franklin contends that in European Union elections opponents of the federation, and of its legitimacy, are just as likely to vote as proponents.|$|E

2500|$|Local {{conditions}} {{also affect}} exports; [...] state over-regulation in several African nations can prevent their own exports from becoming competitive. Research in <b>Public</b> <b>Choice</b> economics {{such as that}} of Jane Shaw suggest that protectionism operates in tandem with heavy State intervention combining to depress economic development. Farmers subject to import and export restrictions cater to localized markets, exposing them to higher market volatility and fewer opportunities. When subject to uncertain market conditions, farmers press for governmental intervention to suppress competition in their markets, resulting in competition being driven out of the market. As competition is driven out of the market, farmers innovate less and grow less food further undermining economic performance.|$|E
2500|$|If {{voluntary}} {{provision of}} public goods will not work, then the obvious solution is making their provision involuntary. This saves {{each of us}} from our own tendency to be a free rider, while also assuring us {{that no one else}} will be allowed to free ride. [...] One frequently proposed solution to the problem is for governments or states to impose taxation to fund the production of public goods. This does not actually solve the theoretical problem because good government is itself a public good. [...] Thus it is difficult to ensure the government has an incentive to provide the optimum amount even if it were possible for the government to determine precisely what amount would be optimum. [...] These issues are studied by <b>public</b> <b>choice</b> theory and public finance.|$|E
