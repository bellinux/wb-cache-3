40|$|The streamwater {{chemistry}} in two {{mountain forest}} watersheds in the Bavarian Alps is described. A close correlation {{was found to}} exist between precipitation and runoff. However, the rainwater was to a great part first stored in the ecosystem, to be exchanged by new rainwater after each rainfall event, thus enabling system buffering. An almost complete buffering of aeidity could be identified due to the strong watershed Output of alkali and alkaline earth cations and silicic acid. On the other hand, protons, organic carbon. nitrogen, organic and inorganic pollutants were aecumulated in the ecosystem. 40 % of tree stem volume was removed {{from one of the}} watersheds after a monitoring period of about two years (<b>patch</b> <b>cutting</b> method) in order to make observations on the stability of these ecosystems in situations of natural or man-made disturbances. Runoff and export rates strongly increased in the first year after the disturbance due to enhanced mineralisation, aeidification, and a reduced uptake of nutrients and waler.

40|$|Silvicultural systems {{integrate}} both regeneration {{and intermediate}} operations {{in an orderly}} process for managing forest stands. The clearcutting method of regeneration favors the development of species that are moderately intolerant to intolerant of shade. In fact, clearcutting is the most proven and widely used method of successfully regenerating bottomland oak species in the South. The seed-tree method of regeneration favors the establishment of light-seeded species. Mechanical soil scarification may be necessary if the desired species requires bare mineral soil for establishment. The shelterwood method of regeneration can provide {{for the development of}} heavy-seeded species, but has produced highly variable results with southern bottomland oaks. The single-tree selection method of regeneration favors the development of shade-tolerant species. When single-tree selection is applied repeatedly to stands containing commercially valuable shade-intolerant species, composition will gradually shift to less-valuable, more-tolerant species. Consequently, the single-tree selection method of regeneration is not recommended for any commercially valuable bottomland hardwood tree species. Group selection, in its strictest application, creates only small openings that usually fail to allow sufficient light to the forest floor for satisfactory establishment and development of shade-intolerant bottomland species. <b>Patch</b> <b>cutting,</b> a combination of uneven-aged (group selection) and even-aged (clearcutting) silviculture, designed to create larger openings, has been successfully used to produce an uneven-aged stand that consists of many small, irregularly shaped, even-aged groups...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 This study {{quantified}} {{the magnitude}} and timing of summer streamflow deficits in paired-watershed experiments in the Cascade Range of Oregon where mature and old-growth conifer forests were subjected to clearcutting, <b>patch</b> <b>cutting,</b> and overstory thinning treatments in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Hydrologic effects of clearcutting, small-patch cutting, and overstory thinning in the mixed conifer/brush zone were studied (1 watershed (WS) each) in the Coyote Creek WS of the South Umpqua Experimental Forest at 42 ° 1 ' 15 "N and 122 ° 43 ' 30 "W. Hydrologic effects of clear cutting (3 WS), shelterwood cutting (1 WS), <b>patch</b> <b>cutting</b> (1 WS), and young forest thinning (1 WS) were examined in the Tsuga heterophylla zone at the H. J. Andrews experimental forest at 44 ° 14 ' 0 "N and 122 ° 11 ' 0 " W. Climate of both sites is marine west coast with winter precipitation and dry summers, producing minimum streamflows in August and September. Changes in flow frequency distributions were detected by counting days below streamflow thresholds where the thresholds were established using percentiles from pre-cutting streamflow records. Changes in relative streamflow were established by the station pair method. Summer streamflow deficits were largest and most persistent in 35 to 50 -year-old forest plantations created from clearcutting and shelterwood cutting in the 1960 s and 1970 s. Summer streamflow deficits were smallest and most ephemeral in a stand that experienced 50 % overstory thinning in 1971. Summer streamflow deficits of intermediate size and persistence developed in watersheds in which 25 to 30 % of the area had been patchcut in the 1960 s or 1970 s. A sparse (12 %) precommercial thin of a 27 -year-old stand exhibiting summer streamflow deficits had comparatively little effect on streamflow deficits. Streamflow deficits emerged as early as March or April and persisted into October and November in the warmer, drier site in southern Oregon (Coyote Creek), whereas summer streamflow deficits were restricted to July through September in the cooler, wetter Andrews Forest. These {{findings are consistent with}} previous studies demonstrating (1) increases in water use in certain conifer species relative to others (e. g. Douglas-fir versus pine); (2) higher water use in young (i. e., 10 to 50 -yr-old) compared to old (100 to 250 -yr-old) stands of many tree species; and (3) decreased interception capacity of young relative to old forest stands associated with loss of canopy epiphytes. Results appear to be robust, despite gaps in data availability, uncertainties associated with changes in stream gauging, streamflow trends over time in control watersheds, and multi-decadal fluctuations in regional climate over the study period. These findings support the notion that variable-intensity logging prescriptions over small areas to approximate natural forest structure may have the least effect on summer streamflows. However, more research, preferably new paired watershed experiments, is needed to quantify {{the magnitude and}} duration of summer streamflow effects from various levels of overstory and understory thinning treatments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Computing {{smooth and}} optimal {{one-to-one}} maps between surfaces of same topology {{is a fundamental}} problem in computer graphics and such a method provides us a ubiquitous tool for geometric modeling and data visualization. Its vast variety of applications includes shape registration/matching, shape blending, material/data transfer, data fusion, information reuse, etc. The mapping quality is typically {{measured in terms of}} angular distortions among different shapes. This paper proposes and develops a novel quasi-conformal surface mapping framework to globally minimize the stretching energy inevitably introduced between two different shapes. The existing state-of-the-art intersurface mapping techniques only afford local optimization either on surface <b>patches</b> via boundary <b>cutting</b> or on the simplified base domain, lacking rigorous mathematical foundation and analysis. We design and articulate an automatic variational algorithm that can reach the global distortion minimum for surface mapping between shapes of arbitrary topology, and our algorithm is sorely founded upon the intrinsic geometry structure of surfaces. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt towards numerically computing globally optimal maps. Consequently, our mapping framework offers a powerful computational tool for graphics and visualization tasks such as data and texture transfer, shape morphing, and shape matching.

Recent changes in management approaches such as protection of small streams and gullies, wildlife tree <b>patches,</b> and partial <b>cutting</b> strategies such as variable retention have increased the need by managers for up-to-date knowledge of windthrow assessment and management techniques. Managers also need to understand the positive and negative impacts of windthrow on forest values, and ecosystem health and function {{in order to determine the}} acceptable levels of damage in prescriptions, and identify where salvage is appropriate.

40|$|Jhum cultivation, {{popularly known}} as slash and burn is the most {{prevalent}} form of cultivation {{in the hills of}} tropical Asian countries including Bangladesh. Jhuming involves <b>cutting</b> <b>patches</b> forests of the mountains in January to March, left on the hill slopes for one month for drying and burning of the dried plants. Small holes are made throughout the sloppy fields and seeds of different crops are sown in the holes in April. Crops are harvested in succession as they ripe between July to December. This study examines the impacts of jhum cultivation on the management of soil and water resources, biodiversity, forest productivity and socio-economic conditions of the jhum cultivators (tribal peoples). A vast area of land comes under jhum cultivation every year in tropical Asia. The jhum cultivation lead to decline of productivity by 50 %, the yields are almost equal to the input values and the farmers are experienced food shortage of 2 to 6 months every year. The jhum farmers adopt new occupations to support their livings. An amount of 100 to 250 metric tons of topsoil per hectare are depleted per year due to jhum cultivation. The rotation cycle of fallowing has been reduced from 7 - 8 to 3 - 4 years especially in Bangladesh. The forest birds, arboreal mammals and plants were disturbed significantly and a few species are found in the second-growth habitats created by jhum cultivation. The reasons for this mountain degradation were identified as government policies in classifying jhum fallow lands as wastelands or degraded forest which made end of community ownership.
