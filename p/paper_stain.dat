40|$|Abstract. Filter paper splash {{procedure}} {{is a kind}} of measuring means to raindrop size. It is used widely and operated briefly and its cost is low. The article mainly introduces the influence of different heights to the stain diameter and the relationship between stain diameter and the raindrop’s. According to the experiment, the relation between the stain diameter and the raindrop’s is d= 0. 478 D 0. 610. it is the research foundation of filter <b>paper</b> <b>stain</b> method. According to the data from Fangxian area using the method of filter paper splash procedure, we can conclude that the raindrop kinetic energy has a positive relationship with rainfall intensity. The research is useful for measuring the water and soil loss. Water and soil loss is one of the global environment problems. The most important factor which can cause water and soil loss is rainfall. The research on raindrop kinetic energy is important for the further analysis of water and soil loss. A classical approach for the research on raindrop kinetic energy is paper splash procedure. The relationship between stain diameter and raindrop diameter shall be calibrated in this approach. In general, influences from titrated water drop height and stain diameter are not considered in the calibration process. In this experiment, influences of rain drop height on stain diameter are researched in the stain calibration...|$|E

But then Mr Kirby argued, against the chairman, Mr Wilkins, that the shares were held on trust for the individual shareholders, and so he could not vote at any meeting on the shares. Mr Wilkins argued that the shares would be held on trust for the company.|$|R

This paper presents evidence on the impact of financial structure on poverty reduction. Is a bank-based or market-based financial system preferred?

This <b>paper</b> <b>stains</b> to contribute to the debate on the financial structure and poverty.

Using panel data on a sample composed of 38 developing countries over the period 1990 - 2011 and applying the Generalized Method of Moment technique, we investigate the issue that the used financial structure indicators don’t favour any financial sector. That is, in the presence of liberalised financial system, a bank-based financial system is better in reducing poverty...|$|R

In 1902 Strang retired from the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers, as a protest against the inclusion in its exhibitions of etched or engraved reproductions of pictures.
