5000|$|Traditional seaside rock is {{made using}} {{granulated}} sugar and glucose syrup. The mix is approximately 3:1, i.e. three parts sugar to one part glucose syrup. This is mixed {{together in a}} pan with enough water to dissolve the sugar (not enough water will result in burning the sugar or the end product being sugary and possibly [...] "graining off"). This is then boiled to approximately 147 °C or [...] "hard crack" [...] before being poured onto water-cooled steel plates. Once poured, food colourings for the casing and lettering are added and mixed in by hand using a spoon or small palette knife. Once the toffee mixture is poured onto a water-cooled plate, it begins to form a skin underneath, this {{makes it possible to}} cut out the colourings, using a pair of shears. The casings and lettering is constantly [...] "turned in" [...] to prevent [...] "chill" [...] (unsightly lumps in the finished product). The remainder of the toffee is stiffened up before going onto a [...] "pulling" [...] machine, a machine that has a fixed arm, and two moving arms, one rotating clockwise, the other counter-clockwise.

40|$|Abstract: FBG sensors are optical strain gages {{that offer}} many {{advantages}} over the conventional ones {{such as a}} long term stability. This long term stability of the sensor has {{to be accompanied by}} durable contact with the structure. For instance when the sensors are used for monitoring a bridge of a highway the glue used to attach the sensor on the metallic reinforcement may be spoiled by the severity of the environment. In this paper a specimen of a reinforced concrete with an FBG sensor glued on the metallic reinforcement has been subjected to thermal cycles. Tensile tests have been performed on the specimen while reading the FBG response. The wavelength shifts of the sensors compared with the readings of the <b>pulling</b> <b>machine</b> has given information {{on the quality of the}} adhesion of the sensor to the specimen and consequently on the effect that the environment had on the glue...|$|R

Take seamless steel tubes as raw materials, they are acidified and phosphates before the cold pulling {{to guarantee that}} mold and pipe have a good lubrication and have a high temperature stability during the cold pulling processing, thus the cold pulling process can be stable. When the seamless steel tubes are brought into the drawing processing, a process provides with a Hydraulic <b>pulling</b> <b>machine,</b> matches special cold pulling die, then they occur plastic deformation uniformly and satisfy the dimension requirements,whose accuracy can reach IT 7 ~IT 8 and the surface roughness is Ra 0. 4 ~ 0. 6.

40|$|The {{search for}} {{gravitational}} wave signals from astrophysical sources {{has led to}} the current work to upgrade the two largest of the long-baseline laser interferometers, the LIGO detectors.

These quadruple pendulums use synthetic fused silica fibers produced using a CO 2 laser <b>pulling</b> <b>machine</b> to reduce thermal noise in the final suspension stage. The suspension thermal noise in Advanced LIGO is predicted to be limited by internal damping in the surface layer of the fibers, damping in the weld regions, and the strength of the fibers.

We also show measurements of mechanical loss in laser polished fibers, showing a reduction of 30 % in internal damping in the surface layer...|$|R

Additionally, the tests show that close agreement with the results obtained from the calibrated force applied by the <b>pulling</b> <b>machine</b> and from a conventional resistive strain gauge mounted on the rod itself is obtained. Calculations from strain to shear stress show a relatively uniform stress distribution along the bar anchor used.

The main disadvantage of this drive is manual and step-wise torque control. This research was done to replace the linear motor drive by AC drive with direct torque control technology.

Motor rotational speed and torque were calculated from required linear velocity of <b>puller</b> <b>machine</b> and <b>pulling</b> force required for extruded aluminum sections. Results: The suggested AC drive with direct torque control was implemented and installed. It proved higher reliability due to elimination of mechanical problems and wears.

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{upgrade to}} the LIGO detectors {{to form the}} Advanced LIGO detector system is intended to incorporate a low thermal noise monolithic fused silica final stage test mass suspension based on developments of the GEO 600 suspension design.

To this end a fibre <b>pulling</b> <b>machine</b> based on a CO 2 laser as the heating element is being developed in Glasgow with funding from EGO and PPARC.
