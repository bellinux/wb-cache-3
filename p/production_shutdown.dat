In August and September 1992, GM workers in Lordstown, Ohio, struck a critical GM parts plant with Yokich's permission, idling many other GM plants and throwing 40,000 other GM employees out of work.

A new contract was reached on September 15, 1993, but the deal was considered a failure since Bieber was unable to win any major changes to the old agreement.

Although, these electromechanical devices are highly reliable, they are susceptible to many types of faults. Such fault can become catastrophic and cause <b>production</b> <b>shutdowns,</b> personal injuries and waste of raw material. However, induction motor faults can be detected in an initial stage in order to prevent the complete failure of an induction motor and unexpected production costs. The motive of this project is to analyse the fault in induction motor through sound and electrical signature produced during the specific fault existing in the induction motor and then to analyse it through various technique. In this paper, a method for mechanical and electrical fault diagnosis in induction motor through sound and electrical signature analysis has been proposed. The work reported in this project uses noninvasively method for sound signature for diagnosing different mechanical faults. For the electrical fault diagnosis the current signature of 3 -phase induction motor has been recorded. The recorded sound signature and current signature of the faulty induction motor and a healthy induction motor during different faults have been analysed using Fourier transform. The magnitude and frequency of FFT of these signatures have been used for identification of different faults using fuzzy system. Keywords—Induction motor, fuzzy logic I...|$|R

30|$|Dynamic voltage support. During {{the last}} decades, a {{steadily}} {{transformation of the}} load equipment has occurred. Classical electromechanical components are being replaced by electronic ones, providing higher functionalities and improved efficiency but also with a higher sensitiveness to the voltage power quality [55]. Voltage disturbances like voltage sags may have a catastrophic effect on industrial processes [56, 57, 58], causing <b>production</b> <b>shutdowns</b> leading to non-negligible economic costs [42]. Voltage sags experienced by a sensitive load connected to a distribution system are mainly produced by short-circuit faults [59] in adjacent feeders to the one where the load is connected to, as shown in Fig.  24. However, {{it has to be}} considered that faults cannot be fully eliminated in spite of the utilities’ many efforts to prevent them by adequate tree trimming, insulation washing, adding animal guards, installation of line arresters, etc. Therefore, it is mandatory for those sensitive final users with critical processes to be protected against this type of disturbances. For this purpose, series compensation is quite effective as shown in Fig.  24. In this case, the series-connected AC/DC VSC has to inject a series voltage to restore the voltage prior to the fault. Different alternative topologies involving DC energy storage or additional shunt converters have been reported [60]. The dynamic compensation using these devices is challenging because of two main issues. First, the immunization degree strongly depends on the type of voltage sag but also on the selected topology and the implemented control algorithm [60]. Therefore, the selection of a cost-effective immunization technique is difficult. Second, the detection technique for voltage sags requires advanced real-time algorithms able to quickly detect voltage phase-angle jumps and the different voltage sequences [61].|$|R

These are guided wave and vibration analysis. This {{research focuses on}} vibration analysis method, based on variation in the natural frequencies and/or damping ratios caused by blockages. Experimental simulation studies the performance to assess {{the viability of the}} vibration analysis method in identifying blockage in the cyclone. To test this method, a 1. 87 m long vertical cylindrical steel tube with both ends simply supported was setup as a prototype and flour was used as the powder conveyed by the tube. Analytical, numerical and experimental methods were implemented on the prototype using vibration analysis techniques. Experimental resonant frequencies of the empty shell from the impact hammer excitation were compared with analytical and numerical solutions to analyse the modal shapes. The first bending mode was determined as 79 Hz, which decreased with the amount of added mass and location closer to the middle point. This was validated by the simulated mass experiment, which also matched with the beam-mass theory. Flour induced experiment further validated the variation of the first bending mode. Experimental 270 Hz, 380 Hz and 398 Hz resonant frequencies increased with the amount of added mass, which was validated by the simulated mass and flour induced experiment. Besides the variation of the natural frequencies, the damping ratio was also studied and quantified using the Hilbert transform envelope curve method. Onsite monitoring of the vibration of the cyclone in a spray dryer was done at Fonterra Te Rapa and clear resonant frequencies were obtained. The research results from the prototype demonstrate that vibration analysis as a non-destructive method to detect the milk powder deposition or blockage in the cyclone is possible and promising.

Odaira's company soon became the domestic leader in electric motors and electric power industry infrastructure. The company began as an in-house venture of Fusanosuke Kuhara's mining company in Hitachi, Ibaraki. Odaira moved headquarters to Tokyo in 1918. Long before that, he coined the company’s toponymic name by superimposing two kanji characters: hi meaning “sun” and tachi meaning “rise”. The young company's national aspirations were conveyed by its original brand mark, which evoked Japan's imperial rising sun flag. World War II and its aftermath devastated the company. Many of its factories were destroyed by Allied bombing raids, and after the war, American occupational forces tried to disband Hitachi altogether. Founder Odaira {{was removed from the}} company. Nevertheless, as a result of three years of negotiations, Hitachi was permitted to maintain all but 19 of its manufacturing plants. The cost of such a <b>production</b> <b>shutdown,</b> though, compounded by a three-month labor strike in 1950, severely hindered Hitachi's reconstruction efforts. Only the Korean War saved the company from complete collapse. Hitachi and many other struggling Japanese industrial firms benefited from defense contracts offered by the American military. Meanwhile, Hitachi went public in 1949.http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/hitachi-ltd-history/ Hitachi America, Ltd. was established in 1959. Hitachi Europe, Ltd. was established in 1982. In March 2011, Hitachi agreed to sell its hard disk drive subsidiary, HGST, to Western Digital (WD) for a combination of cash and shares worth US$4.3 billion. Due to concerns of a duopoly of WD and Seagate Technology by the EU Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, Hitachi's 3.5" [...] HDD division was sold to Toshiba. The transaction was completed in March 2012. Hitachi entered talks with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in August 2011 about a potential merger of the two companies, in what would have been the largest merger between two Japanese companies in history. The talks subsequently broke down and were suspended. In October 2012, Hitachi agreed to acquire the United Kingdom-based nuclear energy company Horizon Nuclear Power, which plans to construct up to six nuclear power plants in the UK, from E.ON and RWE for £700 million. In November 2012, Hitachi and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries agreed to merge their thermal power generation businesses into a joint venture to be owned 65% by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and 35% by Hitachi. The joint venture began operations in February 2014.|$|E
30|$|The {{expected}} value of environmental prediction information is assessed by carrying through {{two sets of}} calculations, one with and one without ice forecasts. The base case computes the expected annual cost of ice to an offshore platform similar to the White Rose without any use of countermeasures such as escort vessels nor any use of environmental prediction. This provides a baseline against which the other strategies can be judged. Four {{percent of the time}} the middle circle is breached. A middle circle breach requires a one day <b>production</b> <b>shutdown</b> at a cost of one day’s deferred production, estimated to be $ 2.25 million. As we assume 30 ice risk days in a year so the total cost of this middle circle breach is 30 x 0.04 x$ 2.25 [*]=[*]$ 2.7 million. Conditioned on the middle circle being breached, one-quarter of the time the inner circle is breached next. An inner circle breach requires a shutdown for 7 [*]days (after which it is assumed that the ice has left the outermost threat circle) at a cost of 7 [*]days of lost production. Again, there are 30 ice days in a year so the cost of an inner circle breach is $ 4.725 million. So the total expected annual cost of ice, with no countermeasures and no use of environmental prediction, is about $ 7.4 million.|$|E
5000|$|In JIC, {{manufacturers}} need {{to maintain}} large inventories of supplies, parts, warehousing resources, and extra workers to meet production contingencies. These contingencies, more common in less industrialized countries, can be poor transportation infrastructure, poor quality control, vulnerability to other suppliers' production problems, and natural disasters. These supply-chain instabilities could lead to costly production inefficiencies therefore a manufacturer may maintain and pay for excess inventory and backups of [...] "fragile" [...] production stages which {{could get out of}} sync, cause <b>production</b> <b>shutdowns,</b> or create supply-chain delays for other manufacturers. In JIC, manufacturers reorder stock before it reaches the buffer level or minimum level to allow themselves to have inventories to be sold while the suppliers are supplying the goods. This time range from the time the firm reorders the stock to the time the supplier provides the new stock is known as lead time. Thus a JIC inventory system tries to keep a minimum level of inventories just in case of emergencies, hence the name [...] "Just In Case". One major reason for practicing a more costly JIC system are the potential losses paid (i.e. permanent loss of major customers, loss of suppliers, supply-chain collapse) if supply-chain shocks occur on several occasions. If the JIT response contingencies are too slow or fail to keep production flowing additional costs may be incurred. Under these circumstances the additional costs due to maintaining extra storage, resources, and system resiliency may potentially be more cost effective than using a more efficient JIT system. A JIC examples of buyers would be the military or hospitals who {{need to maintain}} large inventories because waiting for JIT producers to ramp up production for needed supplies may result in losses (i.e. wars, lives).|$|R
40|$|The Great East Japan Earthquake {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the supply chain management (SCM) employed by Japanese industries, and particularly by the automobile industry. Observed supply chain disruptions and <b>production</b> line <b>shutdowns</b> are recognized as symbolic of weaknesses in industrial SCM. The Japanese automobile industry in particular is now keen to improve supply chain resiliency in terms of automobile assembly line continuity. In view of this, we i) review observed negative impacts of the Great East Japan Earthquake on the automobile industry, ii) identify current strategies being evaluated by the automobile industry for improving supply chain resiliency, iii) develop a numerical supply chain model for the automobile industry, and iv) evaluate efforts to improve SCM practice through inclusion of risk mitigation measures. We conclude with recommendations for policy development to further strengthen automobile industry resiliency...|$|R
