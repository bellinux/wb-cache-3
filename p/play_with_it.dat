5|$|Compared to {{the nurse}} shark, the tawny nurse shark has a more placid {{disposition}} and will often allow divers to touch and <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> However, it should be accorded respect due to its powerful jaws and sharp teeth. This species is caught by commercial fisheries across most of its range for meat, fins, liver oil, leather, and fishmeal. It is also esteemed as a game fish off Queensland, Australia, and {{is known for its}} habit of spitting water in the faces of its captors. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the tawny nurse shark as Vulnerable, with subpopulations in several areas already diminished or extirpated.|$|E

As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves Reese's Pieces candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it.

When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead chrysanthemums.|$|E

500|$|Conan brought Schwarzenegger {{worldwide}} {{recognition as}} an action star and established {{the model for}} most of his film roles: [...] "icy, brawny, and inexpressiveyet somehow endearing." [...] The image of him as the barbarian was an enduring one; when he campaigned for George H. W. Bush to be president, he was introduced as [...] "Conan the Republican"a moniker that stuck with him throughout his political career and was often repeated by the media during his term as Governor of California. [...] Schwarzenegger was aware of the benefits the film had brought to him, acknowledging the role of Conan as [...] "God's gift to [...] career." [...] He embraced the image: when he was Governor of California, he displayed his copy of the Atlantean sword in his office, occasionally flourishing the weapon at visitors and letting them <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> [...] More than once, he spiced up his speeches with Conan's [...] "crush your enemies, see them driven before you and hear the lamentations of their women".|$|E
500|$|During Hale's {{period as}} a {{barrister}} and judge, the general conclusion in England {{was that the}} repository {{of the law and}} conventional wisdom was not politics, as in Renaissance Europe, but the common law. This had been brought about thanks to Sir Edward Coke, who in his Institutes and practice as a judge advocated judge-made law. Coke asserted that judge-made law had the answer to any question asked of it, and as a result, [...] "a learned judge... was the natural arbiter of politics". This principle was known as the [...] "appeal to reason", with [...] "reason" [...] referring not to rationality but the method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws. Coke's theory meant that certainty of the law and [...] "intellectual beauty" [...] was the way to see if a law was just and correct, and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable. John Selden held similar beliefs, in that he thought that the common law was the proper law of England. However, he argued that this did not necessarily create judicial discretion to <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> and that proper did not necessarily equal perfect. The law {{was nothing more than a}} contract made by the English people; this is known as the [...] "appeal to contract". Thomas Hobbes argued against Coke's theory. Along with Francis Bacon, he argued for natural law, created by the King's authority, not by any individual judge. Hobbes felt that there was no skill unique to lawyers, and that the law could be understood not through Coke's [...] "reason" [...] (the method used by lawyers) but through understanding the King's instructions. While the judges did make law, this was only valid because it was [...] "tacitly confirmed (because not disapproved) by the [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|Sessions {{is against}} legalizing {{marijuana}} for either recreational or medicinal use. [...] "I'm {{a big fan}} of the DEA", he said during a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sessions was [...] "heartbroken" [...] and found [...] "it beyond comprehension" [...] when President Obama said that cannabis is not as dangerous as alcohol. In April 2016, he said {{that it was important to}} foster [...] "knowledge that this drug is dangerous, you cannot <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> it is not funny, it's not something to laugh about ... and to send that message with clarity that good people don't smoke marijuana".|$|E
2500|$|Orange Man is also {{credited}} by Curveball Media for pioneering {{what would}} later become known as guerilla advertising, with Tim Delaney of Legas Delaney saying [...] "the whole point was that this radical, strong, full-of-attitude campaign worked – it shifted cans of fizzy pop {{in a way that}} got Britvic's rivals panicking. It also showed what potential there was in thinking of completely fresh ideas. And better than that – it became part of our culture." [...] Trevor Robinson told The Guardian in 2015 that [...] "You can say 'Tango ad' to people and they still remember it. Some even dress up as the Orange Man today.

Dubbed [...] "The Soothsayer", the board revealed stories, gave names and made demands, as the band was contacted by three different people who appeared in the form of one, who was then referred to as [...] "Goliath". The more the band interacted with [...] "The Soothsayer", otherworldly coincidences began plaguing the band's experience writing and recording The Bedlam in Goliath: Blake Fleming, their drummer at the time, quit mid-tour and left the band with financial troubles; Bixler-Zavala wound up needing surgery performed on his foot due to the shoes he had been wearing, forcing him to relearn how to walk post-surgery; audio tracks sporadically disappeared from the studio's harddrives; Rodriguez-Lopez's home studio flooded and was subject to multiple power outages; and the album's original engineer went through a nervous breakdown, leaving behind all previous work with no notes as to where anything was. The engineer who quit stated to Rodriguez-Lopez: [...] "I'm not going to help you make this record. You're trying to do something very bad with this record, you're trying to make me crazy and you're trying to make people crazy." ...|$|E
