40|$|Feedback of {{interaction}} forces/torques in robot supported {{minimally invasive surgery}} (MIRS) meanwhile is a widely accepted advantage. To avoid parasitic effects on the according force/torque sensor, e. g. due to friction in the trocar, a sensor integration as distal as possible is advisable. Since common sensor principles are based on wire or fibre connection and since an axisymmetrical instrument's distal end has to be actuated {{in at least one}} additional degree of freedom (DoF) for full dexterity inside the <b>patient,</b> <b>cable</b> (or fibre) break is a serious problem. A constraint guided spine-kinematics without rotatory DoF at its distal end is proposed to reduce the danger of cable (or fibre) break due to a curved flection instead of a sharply bending joint. The properties of a constraint spine-kinematics with one DoF adapted to the special requests of an in-house developed MIRS-system is presented, verification data acquired in a specially developed test bed are shown. The results seem suitable for MIRS applications and for a progress towards a 2 DoF solution with the presented constraint principle...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to ventricular ICP, a sensor that resides along the ventricular catheter, {{outside of the}} ventricle, transmits parenchymal ICP using Air Coupled Transduction (ACT) technology (InnerSpace Neuro Solutions, Inc 2010). ACT technology senses pressure utilizing a proprietary air bladder positioned in the parenchyma. In cases where the ventricles of the brain are inaccessible, this provides a benefit, wherein the catheter can be secured in the parenchyma and used as a parenchymal ICP monitor. This unique technology carries pressure waves from the air column to a reusable transducer housed in the Air Management System (AMS) on the terminal end of the patient monitoring cable. When the AMS is manually cycled, air {{is removed from the}} Hummingbird® ICP lumen/sensor membrane and precisely replaced with 32 micro-liters of air, effectively charging the system (InnerSpace Neuro Solutions, Inc 2010). Indicator lights on the AMS housing remind clinicians to re-charge the system every eight hours to maintain the precise amount of air in the system. With this technology, the leveling issues inherent in fluid-coupled systems are eliminated, resulting in precise and positionally-insensitive measurements and an artifact-free, high-fidelity waveform tracing. The AMS <b>patient</b> <b>cable</b> is zeroed from the patient monitor following catheter insertion and initial setup. Re-zeroing is required only as a troubleshooting method, or when the cable becomes disconnected. Neither zeroing nor charging the AMS causes a breach of the sterile integrity of the system. The ability to periodically re-zero the system in situ eliminates the issue of zero drift that is a hallmark of microsensor parenchymal monitors.|$|E

40|$|Continuous on-scalp EEG {{monitoring}} {{provides a}} non-invasive means {{to detect the}} onset of seizures in epilepsy <b>patients,</b> but <b>cables</b> from the scalp pose a severe strangulation hazard during convulsions. Since the power of transmitting the EEG wirelessly is prohibitive, a complete SoC is presented, performing lowpower EEG acquisition, digitization, and local digital-processing to extract detection features, reducing the transmission-rate by 43 x. To maximize power-efficiency, the acquisition LNA operates at the lowest reported VDD (of 1 V, drawing 3. 5 muW), but is able to reject offsets (characteristic of metal-electrodes) that are even larger than the supply voltage. Importantly, its topology simultaneously optimizes noise-efficiency and input-impedance to maximize electrode signal-integrity, and it uses switch-capacitor transformers to improve the noise and manufactureabilty of large on-chip resistors. The complete SoC generates EEG featurevectors every 2 sec, consuming a total of 9 muJ per feature-vector. Intel Foundation (Ph. D.

40|$|Abstract—Stroke affects 750, 000 people annually, and 80 % {{of stroke}} {{survivors}} {{are left with}} weakened limbs and hands. Repetitive hand movement is often used as a rehabilitation technique in order to regain hand movement and strength. In order to facilitate this rehabilitation, a robotic glove was designed {{to aid in the}} movement and coordination of gripping exercises. This glove utilizes a cable system to open and close a <b>patients</b> hand. The <b>cables</b> are actuated by servomotors, mounted in a backpack weighing 13. 2 lbs including battery power sources. The glove can be controlled in terms of finger position and grip force through switch interface, software program, or surface myoelectric (sEMG) signal. The primary control modes of the system provide: active assistance, active resistance and a preprogrammed mode. This project developed a working prototype of the rehabilitative robotic glove which actuates the fingers over a full range of motion across one degree-of-freedom, and is capable of generating a maximum 15 N grip force.

40|$|Electrocardiography (ECG) {{is widely}} used in {{clinical}} practice, for example to diagnose coronary artery disease or the cause of chest pain during a stress test, while the patient is running on a treadmill. Ambulatory ECG monitoring is used for long term recording of ECG signals, while the patient carries out his/her daily activities. Artefacts in ECG are caused by the <b>patient’s</b> movement, moving <b>cables,</b> interference from outside sources, electromyography (EMG) interference and electrical contact from elsewhere on the body. Most of these artefacts can be minimised by using proper electrode design and ECG circuitry. However, artefacts due to subject’s movement are hard to identify and eliminate and can be easily mistaken for symptoms of arrhythmia and the physiological effects of exercise, leading to misdiagnosis and false alarms. Skin stretch {{has been identified as}} a major source of motion artefacts in ECG signals, which arise due to the flow of current, called the ‘injury current’ across the epidermis. Thus, the skin is generally abraded or punctured to minimize variations in injury current. This is unpleasant and not useful for long term monitoring, as the skin regrows after 24 hours. Present motion sensing approaches to artefact reduction in ECG do not measure motion in terms of skin stretch. The main goal {{of this study is to}} quantify and eliminate motion artefacts from ECG pertaining to skin stretch. A polymer patch electrode with Young’s modulus lower than of skin has been developed to simultaneously measure ECG and skin stretch using an optical sensing technique. These signals were combined with infinitesimal strain theory to quantify skin stretch as two dimensional strains. Principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) were utilised for motion artefact removal from ECG signals. A motion Artefact Rejection (AR) system has been developed to validate the approach implemented in this study. As this study mainly focuses on skin stretch induced artefacts, a plastic tube has been used to stretch the forearm skin of 7 subjects across the following age groups: 18 – 35 years (3 subjects), 36 – 55 years (2 subjects), and 56 years and above (2 subjects). ECG with motion artefacts were measured using CNT/PDMS electrodes and dry Ag electrodes. The reference ECG (ECG at rest) was measured from the chest using conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes. The average improvements in SNRs using PCA and ICA algorithms were found to be 4. 249 dB and 9. 586 dB respectively, while the average of maximum deviation from rest/reference ECG was 0. 0843 for ECG with motion artefacts, 0. 0702 for ECG after PCA and 0. 0442 for ECG after ICA. Both PCA and ICA algorithms also aided in removing baseline wander and high frequency noises in the cases of less or no motion artefact. The system performed well in removing artefacts generated due to EMG interference and stretching the skin perpendicular, diagonal and parallel to Langer’s lines. Higher SNRs were achieved when PCA and ICA were performed by using 2 D strains as motion information than when no motion information was used. In conclusion, ICA used for motion artefact reduction in ECG signals shows better performance than other techniques employing adaptive filtering, PCA and ICA. A novel, state-of-the-art technique to identify and eliminate motion artefacts from ECG signals has been developed through this study which is feasible for practical implementations...|$|R
