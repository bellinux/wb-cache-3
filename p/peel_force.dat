40|$|Abstract. It was {{investigated}} that {{the influences of}} the peeling behavior of adhesive tapes in peeling tests on IC chip pick-up performance. Needles peel off an IC chip with an adhesive film from the base material in the pick-up process, by sticking out the backside of the base material. In {{the case that the}} <b>peeling</b> <b>forces</b> of the adhesive tape decrease as the peeling speeds increase in peeling tests, only two kinds of behaviors were observed in pick-up test; the peeling propagated little and the IC chip was not peeled off under critical needle displacement while the pick-up was completed instantaneously over critical needle displacement. In the case that the <b>peeling</b> <b>forces</b> of the adhesive tape increase as the peeling speeds increase, the pick-up time decreased as the needle displacement increased. As a result, it can be concluded that the needle displacement where the peeling propagates instantaneously is critical for succeeded pick-up if the <b>peeling</b> <b>forces</b> of the adhesive tape decrease as the peeling speeds increase. If the <b>peeling</b> <b>forces</b> of the adhesive tape increase as the peeling speeds increase, the information of peeling speeds at each needle displacement are needed to estimate {{how long it takes to}} pick-up a chip...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{specific}} peel system low-density polyethylene/isotactic poly-butene- 1 (PE-LD/iPB- 1), {{which is}} often used for protective packages, was investi-gated in this study. The required <b>peel</b> <b>force</b> to open the package depends {{on the content of}} iPB- 1 and on the processing conditions of the blowing process. Commer-cial products have a constant amount of iPB- 1. Thus, a defined <b>peel</b> <b>force</b> can be adjusted by varying the processing conditions. The standard peel system PE-LD with 6 wt % iPB- 1 was investigated in dependence on the processing conditions. The most important processing parameters of the processing line (extruder, die head, tube forming area) were varied and their influence on the peel properties was examined. For example the temperatures of the melt within the extruder, the size of the die gap within the die head, and the cooling behavior of the film bubble were investigated. Higher melt temperatures within the extruder decreased the <b>peel</b> <b>force.</b> The investigations also revealed a strong dependence of the <b>peel</b> <b>force</b> {{on the size of the}} die gap and on the degree of cooling.

40|$|AbstractThe {{peel test}} {{is a very}} simple and fast method to {{determine}} the adhesion of interconnector ribbons to solar cell metallizations. It {{is part of the}} solar cell standard DIN EN 50461 and is, due to its ease of use, widely accepted to qualify cell metallizations and the soldering process. In the standard a force of 1 N per mm of joint width is specified but other relevant quantities are missing, for example the peeling angle. We show that this lack of specification enables the manipulation of peel testing results. We therefore apply the mechanical theory of Kinloch [1] where measured <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> are translated into adhesive fracture energies GA. The fracture energy is a geometry-independent parameter that describes the energy to break the interfacial bondings at the peel front. It incorporates the dimensions of the ribbon and its stress-strain-curve. We perform 86 peel experiments at 90 °, 135 ° and 180 ° of ribbons on continuous front side busbars of cells from one stringing batch. While the median forces for 90 °(3. 07 N), 135 °(2. 35 N) and 180 °(3. 39 N) differ by up to 30. 4 % we find the median adhesive fracture energies to deviate by only 17. 4 %. Using the same adhesive fracture energy (260 J/m 2) for a 45 ° peel test we expect <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> of 7. 45 N which is factor 2. 4 (2. 2) higher than the 90 ° (180 °) <b>peel</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{peel test}} of soldered/glued ribbons on solar cell metallizations is the {{critical}} test in the PV industry and research community to qualify the integrability of cells into modules. It {{has been shown that}} the peeling angle of the test setup strongly influences the measured <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> [1, 2], leading to higher <b>forces</b> for decreasing <b>peeling</b> angles < 90 ̊ and weakest forces for 135 ̊. Here, we apply the theory of Kinloch and Kawashita [3, 4] to determine the adhesive fracture energies GA from 180 ̊ peel tests of three different ribbons which differ in compliance (softness) and thickness. The experiments show that the soft ribbon (σy = 62 MPa) gives lower <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> than the stiff ribbons (σy = 99 MPa) while the adhesive fracture energies are higher. The thickness variation from 150 μm to 200 μm of the hard ribbon has no significant effect on the adhesive energy. Furthermore, our investigation confirms that switching from 90 ̊ peeling angles to 180 ̊ helps to reduce silicon fracture patterns at high forces. In conclusion, the adhesion does not only depend on the surface properties of cell metallization schemes and soldering conditions, but also on the choice of ribbon used for the peel test. We therefore recommend to use the adhesive fracture energy GA instead of the normalized <b>peel</b> <b>forces</b> to improve the consistency and comparability between different peel testing setups and ribbon materials as the peel test is essential for accepting (or rejecting) novel metallization concepts (plating, metallization pastes) and interconnection technologies (low melting solder alloys, conductive adhesives) ...|$|R

Factors investigated for the <b>peel</b> <b>force</b> response were sealing pressure (3 levels), dwell time (3 levels), sealing temperature (3 levels), and adhesive. Additional factors investigated for the burst pressure response were restraining plate gap, and tray volume, height, length-to-width ratio and area. Polyethylene terephthalate-glycol (PETG) trays with Tyvek 1073 B lids and two popular water-based adhesives were used. Trays were selected to yield three levels of area and three levels of length-to-width ratio, defining nine package configurations. Packages for burst testing were sealed under a fractional factorial design with 27 treatments. Packages for peel testing were sealed under a 17 -point face-centered central composite design.

40|$|The {{peel test}} is a {{commonly}} used testing method for adhesive strength evaluation. The test involves peeling a pressure sensitive tape {{away from a}} substrate and measuring the <b>peel</b> <b>force</b> that is applied to rupture the adhesive bond. In the present study, {{the mechanics of the}} peel test is analyzed based on a cohesive zone model. Cohesive failure is assumed to prevail {{in the vicinity of the}} peel front, that is, the adhesive fails not by debonding from the adherends but by splitting of the adhesive itself. Generally, the failure of the adhesive is accompanied with a process of cavitation and fibrillation. Therefore, the cohesive zone is modeled as a continuous fibrillated region. A Maxwell model is employed to characterize the viscoelastic behavior of the adhesive. The governing equation and boundary conditions that describe the mechanics of the peel test are derived. Numerical results are obtained under steady state conditions. The model predicts the <b>peel</b> <b>force</b> in terms of the peel rate, the peel angle, the nature of the adhesive, and the properties of the backing and the substrate. The traction distribution on the substrate surface is found to depend on various test parameters. Finally, finite element analysis is performed using the commercial software package ABAQUS. The results from FEA are compared with those from the mathematical method to evaluate the validity of the present model. The effective range of the present model is found to be related to the ratio of the critical fibril length to the extent of the cohesive zone. Given the nature of the adhesive as well as the properties of the backing and the substrate, the proposed model is able to predict the <b>peel</b> <b>force</b> and the traction distribution in terms of the peel rate and the peel angle, and thus provides a measure of the strength of the adhesive bond...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} peeling of an adhesive tape subjected to a constant pull speed. Due to the constraint between the pull force, peel angle and the <b>peel</b> <b>force,</b> the equations of motion derived earlier fall {{into the category of}} differential-algebraic equations (DAE) requiring an appropriate algorithm for its numerical solution. By including the kinetic energy arising from the stretched part of the tape in the Lagrangian, we derive equations of motion that support stick-slip jumps as a natural consequence of the inherent dynamics itself, thus circumventing the need to use any special algorithm. In the low mass limit, these equations reproduce solutions obtained using a differential-algebraic algorithm introduced for the earlier singular equations. We find that mass has a strong influence on the dynamics of the model rendering periodic solutions to chaotic and vice versa.

The presented experimental results show two distinct imaging artifacts, the divot and large ringing artifacts, which are inherent to such CNT AFM probes. Through the adjustment of operating parameters, the connection of these artifacts to CNT bending, adhesion, and stiction is described qualitatively and explained. ^ Next, the adhesion and peeling of CNTs on different substrates is quantitatively investigated with theoretical models and a new AFM mode for nanomechanical peeling. The theoretical model uncovers the rich physics of peeling of CNTs from surfaces, including sudden transitions between different geometric configurations of the nanotube with vastly different interfacial energies. The experimental peeling of CNTs is shown to be capable of resolving differences in CNT peeling energies at attoJoule levels on different materials. ^ AFM <b>peeling</b> <b>force</b> spectroscopy is further studied on a variety of materials, including several polymers, to demonstrate the capability of direct measurement of interfacial energy between an individual nanotube or nanofiber and a given material surface. Theoretical investigations demonstrate that interfacial and flexural energies can be decoupled so that the work of the applied <b>peeling</b> <b>force</b> can be used to estimate the CNT-substrate interfacial fracture energy and nanotube 2 ̆ 7 s flexural stiffness. Hundreds of <b>peeling</b> <b>force</b> experiments on graphite, epoxy, and polyimide demonstrate that the <b>peeling</b> <b>force</b> spectroscopy offers a convenient experimental framework to quickly screen different combinations of polymers and functionalized nanotubes for optimal interfacial strength. ^ Finally, multiple CNT AFM probe oscillation states in tapping mode AFM as the cantilever is brought closer to a sample are fully investigated, including two kinds of permanent contact and two types of intermittent contact. Large deformation continuum elastica models of MWCNTs with different end boundary conditions are used to identify whether the CNT remains anchored to the sample in line-contact or in point-contact in the permanent contact regime. Energy dissipation spectroscopy and phase contrast are demonstrated as a way to predict the state of CNT-substrate boundary condition in the intermittent tapping regime on different substrates and to highlight the implications of these different imaging regimes for critical dimension AFM, biological sensing, and nanolithography. ^ Together, this work studies the effect of CNT mechanical interactions in AFM, including artifact-avoidance optimization of and new compositional mapping using CNT AFM probes as well as novel techniques that will potentially enhance the future development of CNT-based nanodevices and materials. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the interfacial nanostructures and the adhesions of the stainless steel (S. S) coating to the polyurethane (PU) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) leathers. Design/methodology/approach: PU leather and PVC leather deposit S. S nano-films on the surface of PU and PVC leathers in this study. The interfacial nanostructures were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The experimental results revealed that the surface roughness of the substrates had extremely important influence on the morphology of nano-films. The adhesions of the S. S coating to the PU and PVC leathers were investigated by the peel-off test. Findings: The results showed that the adhesive performance of the S. S nano-films coating on PVC leather was better than that on the substrate of PU leather. Moreover, a weight loss of per <b>peeling</b> <b>force</b> calculating formulation is proposed to determine the bonding strength between the S. S films and the substrates. Originality/value: In this paper, influence of different substrates on surface morphology of S. S coating was studied by SEM and AFM. Moreover, the weight loss of per <b>peeling</b> <b>force</b> calculating formulation was used to discuss the bonding strength between the S. S coating and the substrates. The research methods presented in this paper are of innovation significance to a certain extent. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
