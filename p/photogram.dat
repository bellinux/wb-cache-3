5000|$|<b>Photograms</b> {{were used}} in the 20th century by a number of photographers, {{particularly}} Man Ray, who called them [...] "rayographs". His style capitalised on the stark and unexpected effects of negative imaging, unusual juxtapositions of identifiable objects (such as spoons and pearl necklaces), variations in the exposure time given to different objects within a single image, and moving objects as the sensitive materials were being exposed. Contemporary artists who are widely known for using <b>photograms</b> are Adam Fuss, Susan Derges and Christian Marclay.|$|R
5000|$|Ei-Q was {{influenced}} by the Surrealist aesthetic and also published essays promoting photography as an art form independent of painting. This did not imply a rejection of painting, and he worked toward what in 1935 he termed photo-dessins, a fusion of <b>photograms</b> and paintings. A first collection of these, published in an edition of 40 in 1936 as Nemuri no riyū ( [...] , [...] "the reason for sleep"), took him to the forefront of the Japanese avant garde. Akiko Okatsuka rates Ei-Q (as he had named himself in 1935), together with Sutezō Otono, as standing out among the many Japanese exponents of <b>photograms,</b> unlike the majority able to use them for expressive rather than merely playful ends. Ei-Q also contributed <b>photograms</b> and photography criticism to Photo Times. (Ei-Q also became an enthusiastic proponent of Esperanto at about the same time.) ...|$|R
