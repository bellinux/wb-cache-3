5|$|On March 26, 2012 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania {{rejected}} {{his appeal}} for retrial that asserted, {{based on a}} 2009 report by the National Academy of Science, that forensic evidence presented by the <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> accepted into evidence in the original trial was unreliable. It {{was reported to be}} the former death row inmate's last legal appeal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the appeal}} hearing at the {{regional}} court in Dresden, in the morning 1 July 2009, nine people {{were present in the}} courtroom: three judges, the prosecutor, Wiens as the defendant, his court-appointed defence counsel, El-Sherbini as witness for the <b>prosecution,</b> <b>and</b> her husband and son as observers. No security personnel were present and no security searches of individuals and their possessions were carried out; this was a common procedure for cases without anticipated security concerns or detained persons present.|$|E
5|$|In July 1889, the Metropolitan Police {{uncovered}} a male brothel operated by Charles Hammond in London's Cleveland Street. Under police interrogation, the male prostitutes and pimps revealed {{the names of}} their clients, who included Lord Arthur Somerset, an Extra Equerry to the Prince of Wales. At the time, all homosexual acts between men were illegal, and the clients faced social ostracism, <b>prosecution,</b> <b>and</b> at worst, two years' imprisonment with hard labour.|$|E

5|$|The {{incident}} {{has become}} a fixture in American history due to the personal nature of the feud between the Earps and the McLaury and Clanton brothers and {{the symbolism of the}} fight between lawmen and the Cowboys. The Cowboys maimed Virgil and murdered Morgan but escaped <b>prosecution,</b> <b>and</b> Wyatt's extra-legal campaign for revenge captured people's attention. The gunfight and its aftermath stand for the change overcoming America as the Western frontier ceased to exist, as a nation that was rapidly industrializing pushed out what had been a largely agrarian economy.|$|E
5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{prejudice}} prong of Strickland, a defendant who rejects the prosecution's plea offer must {{show that there}} is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, the offer would have been accepted by the defendant, not withdrawn by the <b>prosecution,</b> <b>and</b> accepted by the court, and that the sentence actually received exceeded that which would have been received under the plea.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{buildings}} of Fort Yellowstone, the army left {{a legacy of}} policies and practices that served as precedents for the future National Park Service management of national parks. The army military commanders implemented backcountry patrols, wildlife protection and management, and protection of natural features. Army educational programs were later adopted by the National Park Service {{as part of their}} resource management. The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed a ranger force that provided for <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> punishment of those engaged in illegal activity in the national parks. The National Park Service carried over a version of the campaign hat worn by members of the army during the last years of their management of Yellowstone National Park for use by Park Rangers.|$|E

5|$|Disguised as a habitué of {{bars and}} taverns, he {{gathered}} {{much of that}} evidence himself. For all the barriers placed to <b>prosecution,</b> <b>and</b> separating the branches of government, English law still had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton had himself made a {{justice of the peace}} in all the home counties—there is a draft of a letter regarding this matter stuck into Newton's personal first edition of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica which he must have been amending at the time. Then he conducted more than 100 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. Newton successfully prosecuted 28 coiners.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Cresswell (c. 1625– c. 1698), {{also known}} as Mother Creswell and Madam Cresswell of Clerkenwell, {{was one of the}} most {{successful}} prostitutes and brothel keepers of the English seventeenth century. Starting with houses in Bartholomew Close, in the City of London and St Leonard's, Shoreditch, she built a widespread network of brothels across London, supplied with girls and women from across England. Her employees included the wives of soldiers pressed into service for Charles II and gentlewomen who had supported the Cavalier cause during the English Civil War and had since fallen on hard times. Her bawdy houses were favoured by King Charles and his court as well as powerful figures in government and city guilds. This position gave her a measure of immunity from <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> added to her profile as a caricature of iniquity and corruption.|$|E
5|$|In Besançon, the Catholics had {{executed}} Protestants {{for religious}} reasons since 1528. Despite the punishment, <b>prosecution,</b> <b>and</b> banning of Protestants in Besançon, Archbishop Antoine struggled {{to contain the}} spread of Protestant ideas. The preaching of William Farel, Theodore Beza and John Calvin had resulted in people converting to Protestantism; Protestant propaganda, religious gatherings, and iconoclastic attacks on Catholic imagery had also maintained the Protestant community in Besançon. On 1 March 1562, the murder of Huguenots in Wassy, France began the French Wars of Religion. By then, Besançon had become part of an independent republic protected by the Holy Roman Empire, which mostly untouched {{in the beginning of}} the conflict. Despite the oppression in Besançon, many French Protestant reformers continued to flock to the city.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{policies}} and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is ample evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E
5|$|On Monday, April 4, U.S. Attorney Garret S. Cannon {{took over}} the <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> moved that Jackalow be {{transferred}} to the U.S. Marshall in the Essex County Jail. Voorhies again objected to jurisdiction, arguing that if the alleged murder was committed in the Long Island Sound it could only be tried in New York. Vroom on the other hand held that a showing of probable cause had been made. Further, he argued that he had jurisdiction {{on the grounds that the}} murder was committed between the state of New York and the Norwalk Islands, and Jackalow's robbery had in any case continued until his arrival in Barnegat. Jackalow was remanded to Newark to await the decision of the grand jury.|$|E

5|$|Opening {{arguments}} by both <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> defense set up cases {{based on}} purported times of death. Basing their assertion on pathologist-given testimony that Jones had died {{about six hours}} after she ate lunch on May 26, the prosecution claimed that Jones had died more than 24 hours before Kinne and Boldizs found her body; defense attorneys argued that death had more likely occurred six to eight hours prior. Prosecutor J. Arnott Hill cited testimony by Chief of Detectives Lieutenant Harry Nesbitt and by Patricia Jones's husband, Walter, as evidence of Kinne's motive for the crime: the detective recalled statements by Kinne that she was afraid Jones was drifting away from her despite the financial support she offered him, and Jones testified that Kinne had {{told him she was}} pregnant by him and he had thereafter attempted to end the relationship.|$|E
5|$|Prosecution of {{the conspirators}} began in 1990, when {{a federal grand}} jury brought indictments against several of the key players. Some had fled the country, and {{extradition}} proceedings against the perpetrators and subsequent <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> conviction was not completed for sixteen years. The final conspirator was convicted in 2006, when Catherine Jane Stork agreed to return to the United States from Germany in order to be allowed to visit her ill son in Australia. Eight perpetrators received sentences ranging from five years probation to five years in federal prison and an additional member of the Rajneesh commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy. Rajneesh was never prosecuted in relation to the conspiracy, and left the United States after pleading guilty to immigration fraud and agreeing not to reenter the country without permission from the U.S. Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|Taylor was {{the first}} Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a {{specific}} limitation {{on the right of}} defendants to force their witnesses to testify.

Here, however, the Court restricted that ability to comply with court rules, especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both the <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> the defense. This decision was reached over the dissent of three Justices, all of whom felt a defendant's case should not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant's attorney to list appropriate witnesses.|$|E

5|$|The Cleveland Street scandal {{occurred}} in 1889, when a homosexual male brothel in Cleveland Street, Fitzrovia, London, {{was discovered by}} police. The government was accused of covering up the scandal to protect the names of aristocratic and other prominent patrons. At the time, sexual acts between men were illegal in Britain, and the brothel's clients faced possible <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> certain social ostracism if discovered. It was rumoured that Prince Albert Victor, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and second-in-line to the British throne had visited, though this has never been substantiated. Unlike overseas newspapers, the English press never named the Prince, but the allegation influenced {{the handling of the}} case by the authorities, and has coloured biographers' perceptions of him since.|$|E

5|$|After Marathon, {{probably}} in 489, Miltiades, {{the hero of}} the battle, was seriously wounded in an abortive attempt to capture Paros. Taking advantage of his incapacitation, the powerful Alcmaeonid family arranged for him to be prosecuted. The Athenian aristocracy, and indeed Greek aristocrats in general, were loath to see one person pre-eminent, and such maneuvers were commonplace. Miltiades was given a massive fine for the crime of 'deceiving the Athenian people', but died weeks later {{as a result of his}} wound. In the wake of this prosecution, the Athenian people chose to use a new institution of the democracy, which had been part of Cleisthenes's reforms, but remained so far unused. This was 'ostracism'each Athenian citizen was required to write on a shard of pottery (ostrakon) the name of a politician that they wished to see exiled for a period of ten years. This may have been triggered by Miltiades's <b>prosecution,</b> <b>and</b> used by the Athenians to try and stop such power-games among the noble families. Certainly, in the years (487BC) following, the heads of the prominent families, including the Alcmaeonids, were exiled. The career of a politician in Athens thus became fraught with more difficulty, since displeasing the population was likely to result in exile.|$|E
