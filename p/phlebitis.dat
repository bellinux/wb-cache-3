5|$|In {{between his}} various duties and responsibilities, Nansen had {{continued}} to take skiing holidays when he could. In February 1930, aged 68, he took a short break in the mountains with two old friends, who noted that Nansen was slower than usual and appeared to tire easily. On his return to Oslo he was laid up for several months, with influenza and later <b>phlebitis,</b> and was visited on his sickbed by King Haakon VII.|$|E
5|$|There {{is no good}} {{evidence}} aloe vera is of use in treating wounds or burns. There is no {{good evidence}} that topical application of aloe vera is effective for treating genital herpes or psoriasis. A 2014 Cochrane review found no strong evidence {{for the value of}} topical application of aloe vera to treat or prevent <b>phlebitis</b> caused by intravenous infusion.|$|E
5|$|After recuperating from {{a bout of}} <b>phlebitis,</b> Crowley {{set sail}} for the United States aboard the RMS Lusitania in October 1914. Arriving in New York City, he moved into a hotel and began earning money writing for the American edition of Vanity Fair and {{undertaking}} freelance work for the famed astrologer Evangeline Adams. In the city, he continued experimenting with sex magic, {{through the use of}} masturbation, female prostitutes, and male clients of a Turkish bathhouse; all of these encounters were documented in his diaries.|$|E
5|$|Patton {{continued}} playing polo and sailing in this time. After sailing back to Los Angeles {{for extended}} leave in 1937, he was kicked by {{a horse and}} fractured his leg. Patton developed <b>phlebitis</b> from the injury, which nearly killed him. The incident almost forced Patton out of active service, but a six-month administrative assignment in the Academic Department at the Cavalry School at Fort Riley helped him to recover. Patton was promoted to colonel on July 24, 1938 and given command of the 5th Cavalry at Fort Clark, Texas, for six months, a post he relished, but he was reassigned to Fort Myer again in December as commander of the 3rd Cavalry. There, he met Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall, who {{was so impressed with}} him that Marshall considered Patton a prime candidate for promotion to general. In peacetime, though, he would remain a colonel to remain eligible to command a regiment.|$|E
25|$|Quayle {{considered}} {{but decided}} against running for Governor of Indiana in 1996. He decided against {{running for the}} 1996 Republican presidential nomination, citing health problems related to <b>phlebitis.</b> Quayle moved to Arizona in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Urea with σ=.59 was {{introduced}} in 1956 due to low molecular weight and slow penetration of BBB. However, it can cause rebound effects and side effects such as intravascular hemolysis and <b>phlebitis.</b> When Urea is administered, the dosage is 1.5 g/kg or 0.5 g/kg (for elderly).|$|E
25|$|There is an {{intravenous}} preparation available, {{but it is}} irritant to veins, causing <b>phlebitis.</b> Most people {{absorb the}} drug extremely well after taking it orally, so, if a patient can swallow, {{there is not much}} need to administer it intravenously, even if used to treat endocarditis (infection of the heart chambers).|$|E
25|$|<b>Phlebitis</b> is {{inflammation}} of a vein {{that may be}} caused by infection, the mere presence of a foreign body (the IV catheter) or the fluids or medication being given. Symptoms are warmth, swelling, pain, and redness around the vein. The IV device must be removed and if necessary re-inserted into another extremity.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Quayle {{published}} his memoir entitled Standing Firm {{but declined to}} run for public office in this time period because {{he was suffering from}} <b>phlebitis.</b> He sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew and supported George W. Bush. In 2016, he endorsed Jeb Bush and after that he supported Donald Trump for president. Quayle and his wife reside in Paradise Valley, Arizona.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of antiembolism stockings (TED stockings) {{can be used}} to prevent thrombosis. The correct use and properly fitted graded compression stockings can reduce the rate of thrombosis by 50%. Contraindications for the use of antiembolism stockings include the presence of advanced peripheral and obstructive arterial disease, septic <b>phlebitis,</b> heart failure, open wounds, dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy. Differences between the use of thigh-high compression stockings and shorter types to prevent blood clots exist, but remain inconsistent.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{there are}} {{scientists}} {{who claim that}} no hobo spider bites lead to dermal necrosis. Hobo spiders are common in Europe, though bites are relatively uncommon, and other than unconfirmed reports {{there is no evidence}} of them causing necrosis despite hundreds of years of coexistence there. The only documented case of a verified hobo spider bite leading to necrotic skin lesions involves a person who had a pre-existing medical condition (<b>phlebitis)</b> that can also cause the appearance of skin lesions.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the patient, the cancer, {{the stage}} of cancer, the type of chemotherapy, and the dosage, {{intravenous}} chemotherapy may be given on either an inpatient or an outpatient basis. For continuous, frequent or prolonged intravenous chemotherapy administration, various systems may be surgically inserted into the vasculature to maintain access. Commonly used systems are the Hickman line, the Port-a-Cath, and the PICC line. These have a lower infection risk, are much less prone to <b>phlebitis</b> or extravasation, and {{eliminate the need for}} repeated insertion of peripheral cannulae.|$|E
25|$|A {{peripheral}} IV {{cannot be}} left in the vein indefinitely, because of the risk of insertion-site infection leading to <b>phlebitis,</b> cellulitis and sepsis. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated their guidelines and now advise the cannula need to be replaced every 96 hours. This was based on studies organised to identify causes of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in hospitals. In the United Kingdom, the UK Department of health published their finding about risk factors associated with increased MRSA infection, now include intravenous cannula, central venous catheters and urinary catheters as the main factors increasing the risk of spreading antibiotic resistant strain bacteria.|$|E
500|$|Early May saw {{production}} at the [...] "exquisite" [...] village church in Berry Pomeroy for the final wedding scene. From the tenth to the twelfth of May, Marianne's first rescue sequence, depicting her encounter with Willoughby, was shot. Logistics were difficult, as the scene was set upon a hill during a rainy day. Lee shot around fifty takes, with the actors becoming soaked under rain machines; this led to Winslet eventually collapsing from hypothermia. Further problems occurred midway through filming, when Winslet contracted <b>phlebitis</b> in her leg, developed a limp, and sprained her wrist after falling down a staircase.|$|E
500|$|Schweitzer {{experienced}} tremendous {{health issues}} throughout her life, mostly {{in relation to}} the lungs. She first encountered tuberculosis before she turned ten. She was officially diagnosed in the spring of 1922 with laryngeal tuberculosis after exhibiting symptoms of [...] "pain, fever, and the coughing up of blood." [...] In addition the heat of Africa caused many respiratory issues. In 1915, she contracted <b>phlebitis</b> resulting in two weeks of therapeutic bed rest. She also had pneumonia in 1929, almost keeping her from returning to Lambaréné. Despite her already weak lungs, she completed the trip though she had to return early due to illness again.|$|E
500|$|In October 1974, Nixon {{fell ill}} with <b>phlebitis,</b> the {{inflammation}} of {{the walls of a}} vein. Told by his doctors that he could either be operated on or die, a reluctant Nixon chose surgery, and President Ford visited him in the hospital. Nixon was under subpoena for the trial of three of his former aides—Dean, Haldeman, and John Ehrlichman—and The Washington Post, disbelieving his illness, printed a cartoon showing Nixon with a cast on the [...] "wrong foot". Judge John Sirica excused Nixon's presence despite the defendants' objections. Congress instructed Ford to retain Nixon's presidential papers—beginning a three-decade legal battle over the documents that was eventually won by the former president and his estate. Nixon was in the hospital when the 1974 midterm elections were held, and Watergate and the pardon were contributing factors to the Republican loss of 43seats in the House and three in the Senate.|$|E
500|$|In September 1921 Imogen {{became a}} boarder at St Paul's Girls School. In July 1922 she {{performed}} a Bach Prelude and Fugue on the piano, for which Joseph praised her warmly, writing: [...] "I think everyone enjoyed the Bach {{from beginning to}} end, they all made nice contented noises {{at the end of}} it". Imogen's SPGS years were generally happy and successful. In July 1923 she won the junior Alice Lupton piano prize, but her chances of distinction as a pianist were marred when she began to develop <b>phlebitis</b> in her left arm. Among other activities she became interested in folk music and dance, and in 1923 {{became a member of the}} English Folk Dance Society (EFDS). In 1924–25, her final year at SPGS, Imogen founded a folk dance society in the school. At an end-of-term school concert late in July 1925, she played Chopin's étude in E major and gave the first performance of Gustav Holst's Toccata.|$|E
500|$|Though young, Antoine showed great piety, {{which the}} {{historian}} Pierre Debouxhtay {{described as a}} [...] "devotion of a rather scrupulous formalism". Despite his strong faith, Antoine was unsatisfied with his religion. He began {{to be influenced by}} the writings of Allan Kardec and, through his friend Gustave Gon, was initiated in 1884 in Spiritism in attending Spiritist meetings to Tilleur, alongside his wife and his nephew Pierre Dor. In Jemeppe-sur-Meuse, with friends, he started a Spiritist movement called [...] "The Vine Growers of the Lord" [...] ("Les Vignerons du Seigneur"). Often ill, his son attended evening school in Jemeppe, then worked at the Society of Belgian Northern Railways (Société des Chemins de Fer du Nord Belge); At his death on 23 April 1893 because of a <b>phlebitis,</b> Antoine and his group definitively broke with Christianity; moreover, after participating in Spiritist meetings, parents believed that their deceased son was reincarnated as a pharmacist in Paris. Antoine published in 1896 a book entitled Little Spiritist Catechism (Petit catéchisme spirite) to explain his own doctrinal views; shaped on the Catechism of the Catholic Church, this writing was successful and was translated into Spanish. Antoine organized public meetings of Spiritism the first Sunday of each month at his home, and the second and the fourth Sundays at Pierre Debroux's home, people being invited to meetings through flyers. He then discovered the gifts of healing and by 1900, he received many sufferers to heal; thenceforth, he was known as the [...] "healer of Jemeppe". He distributed remedies learned from Spiritism and [...] advocated vegetarianism, as well as temperance and avoidance of fatty foods.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{frequent}} injections and recurring <b>phlebitis,</b> scar tissue can build {{up along the}} vein. [...] The peripheral veins of intravenous drug addicts, and of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, become sclerotic and difficult to access over time, sometimes forming a hard, painful “venous cord”.|$|E
2500|$|Capote died in Bel Air, Los Angeles, on August 25, 1984, age 59. According to the coroner's report, {{the cause}} of death was [...] "liver disease {{complicated}} by <b>phlebitis</b> and multiple drug intoxication." [...] He died at the home of his old friend Joanne Carson, ex-wife of late-night TV host Johnny Carson, on whose program Capote had been a frequent guest. Gore Vidal responded to news of Capote's death by calling it [...] "a wise career move".|$|E
2500|$|In later years, Bartle {{was plagued}} by health {{problems}} including <b>phlebitis</b> and injuries to his back and legs caused by a 1944 plane crash. [...] Bartle died on May 9, 1974, from complications of diabetes and heart disease. He was buried in Forest Hill Cemetery. [...] The Kansas City Convention Center, opened in 1976, was named Bartle Hall in his honor, and Bartle's wife and friends provided items for exhibit cases that there memorialize his life. [...] Bartle's papers are in the State Historical Society of Missouri.|$|E
2500|$|Gleason {{delivered}} a critically acclaimed performance as an infirm, acerbic, and somewhat Archie Bunker–like {{character in the}} Tom Hanks comedy–drama Nothing in Common (1986). This was Gleason's final film role. During production, {{it was determined that}} he was suffering from terminal colon cancer, which had metastasized to his liver. Gleason was also suffering from <b>phlebitis,</b> diabetes and hemorrhoids. [...] "I won't be around much longer", he told his daughter at dinner one evening after a day of filming. Gleason kept his medical problems private, although there were rumors that he was seriously ill. A year later, on June 24, 1987, Gleason died at his Florida home.|$|E
2500|$|The film covers most {{aspect of}} Nixon's life and {{political}} career. The film implies that Nixon {{and his wife}} abused alcohol and prescription medication. Nixon's health problems, including his bout of <b>phlebitis</b> and pneumonia during the Watergate crisis, are also shown in the film, and his various medicants are sometimes attributed to these health issues. The movie also hints at some kind of responsibility, real or imagined, that Nixon felt towards the John F. Kennedy assassination through references to [...] "the Bay of Pigs", the implication being that the mechanisms set into place for the invasion by Nixon during his term as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice-president spiraled out of control to culminate in the assassination and, eventually, Watergate.|$|E

50|$|<b>Phlebitis</b> is {{typically}} caused by local trauma to a vein, usually from {{the insertion of}} an intravenous catheter. However, it can also occur due to a complication of connective tissue disorders such as lupus, or of pancreatic, breast, or ovarian cancers. <b>Phlebitis</b> can also result from certain medications and drugs that irritate the veins, such as desomorphine.|$|E
50|$|Phlebothrombosis {{occurs when}} a blood clot (thrombosis) in a vein (phlebo) forms {{independently}} from the presence of inflammation of the vein (<b>phlebitis).</b> Thrombophlebitis is <b>phlebitis</b> (vein inflammation) related to a thrombus (blood clot).

50|$|<b>Phlebitis</b> or venitis is the {{inflammation}} of a vein, {{usually in the}} legs. It most commonly occurs in superficial veins. <b>Phlebitis</b> often occurs in conjunction with thrombosis and is then called thrombophlebitis or superficial thrombophlebitis. Unlike deep vein thrombosis, the probability that superficial thrombophlebitis will cause a clot to break up and be transported in pieces to the lung is very low.|$|E
