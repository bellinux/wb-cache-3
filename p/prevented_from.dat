5|$|Although the United States Navy was <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> {{developing}} fortifications on the Aleutian Islands due to {{the terms}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, the Navy believed that at some point the United States' treaty obligations would no longer apply, and began to scout the Aleutians for possible naval bases. In 1923, two scouting ships investigated the possibility of establishing anchorages off the Islands, and attempted to claim the United States Army's bases on the Aleutians for the purposes of national security.|$|E

5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would suggest. He was capable of batting well in a crisis but may have been <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E

When he learned of Doug Neidermeyer's fragging in Vietnam, he fell into alcoholism and despair. When he began seeing Jesus in his food, he became a born-again Christian and fell into his current profession as minister and missionary.|$|E
5|$|Conroy {{effectively}} barred Victoria {{from anyone}} other than the Duchess or his relatives and the princess was <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> becoming close to her extended family.

Victoria {{does not appear to have}} been fond of either Conroy sister as there is little positive comment in her personal journals.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the fall}} of the Raevsky redoubt did not have much meaning. The Russian troops {{successfully}} moved to the rear without being destroyed (despite suffering heavy losses). So, in spite of losing some areas in the battlefield, the Russian formation was <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> collapsing. On the French side, the gain of the Raevsky redoubt cost them large casualties and, after that, Napoleon himself ordered his troops to retreat to the starting line. The Russians then reoccupied their previous positions.|$|E

5|$|In June 1903, {{supervised}} by Gabriel Lippmann, Curie was awarded her doctorate from the University of Paris.

Meanwhile, a new industry began developing, based on radium. The Curies did not patent their discovery and benefited little from this increasingly profitable business.|$|E

Just outside the Tech 10-yard line, Indiana was stopped short and <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> scoring a touchdown.

5|$|Justice Hayne {{concluded}} that the detention scheme in the Migration Act did not contravene Chapter III because, fundamentally, it was not punitive. The Act did not make being in Australia without a visa an offence (although {{it had been in}} the past), and in reality he considered the mandatory detention scheme to be not that different from a system in which all people were <b>prevented</b> <b>from</b> entering Australia without permission at all.|$|E
