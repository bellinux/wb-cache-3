50|$|Acrylonitrile is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula CH2CHCN. It is a colorless volatile liquid, although commercial samples can be yellow due to impurities. In {{terms of its}} molecular structure, it consists of a vinyl group linked to a nitrile. It is an important monomer for the manufacture of useful plastics such as <b>polyacrylonitrile.</b> It is reactive and toxic at low doses. Acrylonitrile was first synthesized by the French chemist Charles Moureu (1863-1929) in 1893.|$|E
50|$|Early cotton {{softeners}} {{were typically}} {{based on a}} water emulsion of soap and olive oil, corn oil, or tallow oil. Softening compounds differ in affinity to various fabrics. Some work better on cellulose-based fibers (i.e., cotton), others have higher affinity to hydrophobic materials like nylon, polyethylene terephthalate, <b>polyacrylonitrile,</b> etc. New silicone-based compounds, such as polydimethylsiloxane, work by lubricating the fibers. Manufacturers use derivatives with amine- or amide-containing functional groups as well. These groups improve the softener's binding to fabrics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Polyacrylonitrile</b> (PAN), {{also known}} as Creslan 61, is a synthetic, {{semicrystalline}} organic polymer resin, with the linear formula (C3H3N)n. Though it is thermoplastic, it does not melt under normal conditions. It degrades before melting. It melts above 300 °C if the heating rates are 50 degrees per minute or above. Almost all <b>polyacrylonitrile</b> resins are copolymers made from mixtures of monomers with acrylonitrile as the main component. It is a versatile polymer used to produce large variety of products including ultra filtration membranes, hollow fibers for reverse osmosis, fibers for textiles, oxidized PAN fibers. PAN fibers are the chemical precursor of high-quality carbon fiber. PAN is first thermally oxidized in air at 230 degrees Celsius to form an oxidized PAN fiber and then carbonized above 1000 degrees Celsius in inert atmosphere to make carbon fibers found {{in a variety of}} both high-tech and common daily applications such as civil and military aircraft primary and secondary structures, missiles, solid propellant rocket motors, pressure vessels, fishing rods, tennis rackets, badminton rackets & high-tech bicycles. It is a component repeat unit in several important copolymers, such as styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic.|$|E
50|$|Acrylonitrile is used principally as a monomer {{to prepare}} <b>polyacrylonitrile,</b> a homopolymer, or several {{important}} copolymers, such as styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), {{acrylonitrile butadiene styrene}} (ABS), acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA), and other synthetic rubbers such as acrylonitrile butadiene (NBR). Dimerization of acrylonitrile affords adiponitrile, used in the synthesis of certain polyamides. Small amounts are also used as a fumigant. Acrylonitrile and derivatives, such as 2-chloro-acrylonitrile, are dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions. Acrylonitrile is also a precursor in the industrial manufacture of acrylamide and acrylic acid.|$|E
50|$|Carbon fiber {{is often}} time {{produced}} using two main methods: {{through the use}} of <b>Polyacrylonitrile</b> (PAN) and from pitch. Pitch is a viscoelastic material that is composed of aromatic hydrocarbons. Pitch is produced via the distillation of carbon-based materials, such as plants, crude oil, and coal. Pitch is isotropic, but can be made anisotropic {{through the use of}} heat treatments. However, the most important in carbon fiber production is mesophase pitch due to the ability to melt spin anisotropic mesophase pitch without filament breakage.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{precursor}} {{to make the}} fiber, carbon fiber may be turbostratic or graphitic, or have a hybrid structure with both graphitic and turbostratic parts present. In turbostratic carbon fiber the sheets of carbon atoms are haphazardly folded, or crumpled, together. Carbon fibers derived from <b>polyacrylonitrile</b> (PAN) are turbostratic, whereas carbon fibers derived from mesophase pitch are graphitic after heat treatment at temperatures exceeding 2200 °C. Turbostratic carbon fibers tend to have high tensile strength, whereas heat-treated mesophase-pitch-derived carbon fibers have high Young's modulus (i.e., high stiffness or resistance to extension under load) and high thermal conductivity.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon fibres {{are created}} when <b>polyacrylonitrile</b> fibres (PAN), Pitch resins, or Rayon are {{carbonized}} (through oxidation and thermal pyrolysis) at high temperatures. Through further processes of graphitizing or stretching the fibres strength or elasticity {{can be enhanced}} respectively. Carbon fibres are manufactured in diameters analogous to glass fibres with diameters ranging from 4 to 17 µm. These fibres wound into larger threads for transportation and further production processes. [...] Further production processes include weaving or braiding into carbon fabrics, cloths and mats analogous to those described for glass that can then be used in actual reinforcements.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} often torn ligaments in the body is the {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL). The ACL {{is one of the}} ligaments crucial to knee stability and persons who tear their ACL often seek to undergo reconstructive surgery, which can be done through a variety of techniques and materials. One of these techniques is the replacement of the ligament with an artificial material. An artificial ligament is a reinforcing material that is used to replace a torn ligament, such as the ACL. Artificial ligaments are a synthetic material composed of a polymer, such as <b>polyacrylonitrile</b> fiber, polypropylene, PET (polyethylene terephthalate), or polyNaSS poly(sodium styrene sulfonate).|$|E

Matthews that polysulfones could be formed by the reaction of sulfur dioxide and ethylene, Marvel confirmed the finding, using cyclohexene rather than ethylene.
