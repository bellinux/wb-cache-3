40|$|Aims: To compare {{wage earner}} dental {{technicians}} with non-exposed salaried subjects for the preva-lence of respiratory symptoms and function, and {{chest x ray}} abnormalities. Methods: A total of 134 dental technicians and 131 non-exposed subjects participated. A medical and an occupational questionnaire were filled in to evaluate the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and occupational exposures. Subjects underwent respiratory tests and chest x ray examination. Results: Mean age of the dental technicians was 36. 6 years with a mean duration of dental work of 16. 5 years. There was a significant risk of cough (day and night) and usual phlegm in dental techni-cians. Respiratory function parameters were lower in dental technicians with {{a significant difference between}} exposed and non-exposed groups for % FVC (forced vital capacity), % FEF 25 (forced mid expiratory flow), and % FEF 50. The prevalence of small opacities increased with age. Small opacities were significantly related to an exposure to asbestos in the past. Conclusions: Our young population of dental technicians is at risk of respiratory morbidity. They should benefit from adequate technical prevention measures. Dental technicians are exposed to dust and vapour duringthe manufacture of dental prostheses from the negativeimpression of the patient’s teeth obtained by the dentist.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel process flow {{enabling}} prototyping of microfluidic cartridges {{made out of}} polymer films. Its high performance is proven by implementation of a microfluidic genotyping assay testing 22 DNA samples including clinical isolates from patients infected by methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The microfluidic cartridges (disks) are fabricated by a novel process called microthermoforming by soft lithography (microTSL). <b>Positive</b> <b>moulds</b> are applied allowing for higher moulding precision and very easy demoulding when compared to conventional microthermoforming. High replication accuracies with geometric disk-to-disk variations of less than 1 % are typical. We describe and characterise fabrication and application of microfluidic cartridges with wall thicknesses < 188 microm thus enabling efficient thermocycling during real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The microfluidic cartridges are designed for operation in a slightly modified commercial thermocycling instrument. This approach demonstrates new opportunities for both microfluidic developments and well-established laboratory instruments. The microfluidic protocol is controlled by centrifugal forces and divides the liquid sample parallely into independent aliquots of 9. 8 microl (CV 3. 4 %, N = 32 wells). The genotyping assays are performed with pre-stored primers and probes for real-time PCR showing a limit of detection well below 10 copies of DNA per reaction well (N = 24 wells in 3 independent disks). The system was evaluated by 44 genotyping assays comprising 22 DNA samples plus duplicates {{in a total of}} 11 disks. The samples contained clinical samples of seven different genotypes of MRSA as well as positive and negative controls. The results are in excellent agreement with the reference in microtubes...|$|R

The correct fit of the appliance depends very considerably on the accuracy with which the cast and mould are taken and prepared. It is usual to cast patients for spinal braces in the standing or sitting position with the head supported in an overhead sling. The amount of traction on the head sling depends on the amount of spinal collapse, the amount the patient can support himself, and the amount of traction he can tolerate. The very severely disabled patient with a severe collapsing or fixed scoliosis due, for example, to poliomyelitis or muscular dystrophy is often unable to tolerate the handling and suspension necessary for an adequate cast to be taken. Such severely disabled patients may well be able to control an electrically powered chair if they could have a support manufactured to accept them.

50|$|Microthermoforming is the {{abbreviation}} for microscopic or microscale thermoforming, or, more precisely, for thermoforming of microproducts or microstructure products. Microstructure products means products that have {{structures in the}} micrometre range and have their technical function provided by {{the shape of the}} microstructure 1. Thermoforming 2 in turn means shaping of heated and therefore softened semi finished products in the form of thermoplastic polymer films or plates with their edges fixed by three-dimensional stretching. Shaping is carried out mainly by forming the films or plates into female moulds (negative forming) or over male <b>moulds</b> (<b>positive</b> forming). While the other polymer microreplication processes such as micro injection moulding or (vacuum) hot embossing are primary forming processes where forming occurs already in a molten, liquid phase of the heated polymer material, microthermoforming is a secondary forming process where forming occurs in a strongly softened, but still solid phase of the heated polymer.|$|R

Objective To find out relative frequency of non-dermatophyte moulds and yeasts as causative agents in onychomycosis. Subjects and methods Forty patients of all age groups and either sex suffering from onychomycosis were subjected to fungal cultures. Demographic and clinical features of the patients were recorded. Nail scrapings were inoculated on fungal culture media and growth pattern studied. Results Out of 40 patients, eight (16 %) were positive for fungal culture. Amongst culture positive cases 4 (50 %) were dermatophytes, all of them belonging to genus trichophyton, whereas 2 (25 %) were positive for Candida spp. and 2 (25 %) were <b>positive</b> for non-dermatophyte <b>moulds</b> belonging to Scopulariopsis spp. and Aspergillus spp. each.

40|$|Abstract: Fungi {{belong to}} common allergens, {{which can be}} found both in {{occupational}} and nonoccupational environment. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the frequency and factors associated with mould allergy among bakers and farmers reporting work-related respiratory symptoms. The study group comprised 117 bakers and 83 farmers reporting work-related respiratory symptoms. Skin prick tests (SPT) with common, fungal and occupational allergens, estimation of serum total IgE level, spirometry, histamine test and specific inhalative challenge test with occupational allergens were performed in all subjects. The prevalence of hypersensitivity to fungal species was higher among farmers (32. 5 %) than bakers (16. 2 %). <b>Positive</b> SPT with <b>mould</b> allergens were found among 10. 8 % farmers and 6. 8 % bakers with occupational allergy. The fungi allergens giving positive SPT results most frequently were Candida albicans, Levures mélanges, Aspergillus mix. and Charbons cerealiers in both groups. Among mould allergens, hypersensitivity to Aspergillus genus was the most common in farmers and bakers group, while among Saccharomyces − Candida albicans sensitization was the most frequently detected. Mould hypersensitivity is related to occupational respiratory allergy, especially to asthma and rhinitis in farmers, and occupational asthma in bakers. Although sensitization to Saccharomyces was more frequent, similar correlation was not observed...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{some fundamental}} {{questions regarding the}} nature of identity-based arm d conflict within states, conflict which abuses and consciously targets children and women, leaving them physically scarred and psychologically traumatized. It argues that the poor quality of leadership {{and the lack of}} accountability of those wielding military, economic or political power, are significant root causes of the abuse and traumatization of children, witnessed most graphically in times of armed conflict within states. Exploitative leaders benefit from a sense of invulnerability, of safety from any kind of accountability for their actions – in other words, from a pervasive climate of impunity. The are four courses of action that are particularly worthy of attention: the designation of children as zones of peace; the identification and public naming of those who target and exploit women and children for their own financial or political gain; the development of a more rigorous normative framework, and international vigilance to ensure increased compliance with human rights and humanitarian norms; and finally, the strengthening of democratic institutions which allow for peaceful management of conflict and for equitable development. Taken together these areas offer a number of opportunities to <b>mould</b> <b>positive</b> environments in which leaders are encouraged to exercise their power and authority for the betterment of all their citizens, for the equitable development of their societies, and in the development of channels and institutions which allow differences and conflicts to be settled by peaceful means...|$|R
40|$|Background There are {{conflicting}} {{study results}} regarding {{the association of}} exposure to visible mould and fungal components in house dust with respiratory and allergic diseases in children. It {{has been suggested that}} functional polymorphisms of the GSTP 1 gene may influence the risk for allergic disorders through an impaired defence against oxidant injury. Methods We examined in six birth cohorts of over 14000 children whether the association between early exposure to reported mould at home in relation to respiratory and allergic diseases is modified by a single nucleotide polymorphism of the GSTP 1 gene. Results We observed a <b>positive</b> association of <b>mould</b> exposure with nasal symptoms (210 year) aOR: 1. 19 (1. 0211. 38). Further, there was a borderline significant increased risk of rhinoconjunctivitis (68 year) in children homozygous for the minor allele Val/Val, aOR: 1. 25 (0. 981. 60). In stratified analyses, subjects homozygous for the minor allele and exposed to mould at home were at increased risk for early wheezing aOR: 1. 34 (1. 031. 75), whereas the major allele may confer susceptibility for later nasal outcomes, (68 year) aOR: 1. 20 (1. 001. 45) and (210 year) aOR: 1. 30 (1. 041. 61), respectively. For none of the health outcomes studied, we found gene by environment interactions. Conclusion A genetic influence of the GSTP 1 gene cannot be ruled out, but the magnitude of the effect is a matter of further research. In conclusion, the interplay between gene and environments is complex and remains subject of further study. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{new process}} of {{combining}} gas injection with compression moulding {{was developed and}} studied in this research work. The process is called Gas Assisted Compression Moulding (or GasComp). The principle {{is based on the}} injection of nitrogen gas during a conventional compression moulding cycle. The flow of the material due to the compressive force of the press is assisted by the injection of gas into the centre of the molten material. The gas assists in the flow by coring out the material, reducing the weight by up to 45 percent and increasing the dimensional stability of the component. Novel glass matt thermoplastic mould tools were designed and developed {{during the course of the}} research program for use with the process. These designs were of a flash compression mould tool design with a horizontal clamping face, rather than the conventional <b>positive</b> plug compression <b>mould</b> tool with a vertical shear edge. This created a fixed volume mould tool, which when used in conjunction with a short shot of material, would allow the gas to flow the material to fill the remaining volume. Several materials were investigated for their suitability with the process. Their characterisation showed that they contained different glass fibre contents and architectures. A material with a short, dispersed glass fibre content of 11 percent proved to consistently contain a significant gas cavity. The glass architecture proved to be the most significant contributing factor in the creation of a successful gas cavity. The most significant processing parameter in the creation of a large volume cavity proved to be the gas injection delay time. The gas pressure and gas ramp time affected the cavity shape, length and extent of gas fingering. The shrinkage was reduced in the presence of a gas cavity, along with the visible reduction of sink marks. The presence of other moulding features, such as hesitation marks, gas packing and the change in fibre orientation were also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Thin-walled {{glass fibre}} {{reinforced}} concrete (GFRC) panels {{are being used}} as the primary cladding material on many landmark buildings especially in the last decade. GFRC is an ideal material for building envelopes because it is durable, it can resist fire and the environmental impact is low compared to other materials, because the base materials used {{in the production of}} GFRC are widely available throughout the world. Thin-walled GFRC was initially developed as a cladding material in the 1970 s and 1980 s where the majority of the available research lies.   The introduction of 3 D CAD software has enabled the design of buildings with complex shapes that, in the past, would have been rationalised to meet budget and time constraints. However, when GFRC has been proposed for buildings with a complex free-form geometry it has been replaced with alternative materials such as glass reinforced plastic (GFRP) due to the high cost and time required to fabricate suitable GFRC panels using conventional manufacturing methods. The literature showed that empirical performance characterization of GFRC had not been researched in detail regarding the limits of functionality or any systematic approach to understanding their use in complex geometry building envelopes. As a first step the key architectural demands, the main barriers and limitations in the manufacture of complex geometry thin-walled GFRC were identified by interviewing and visiting manufacturers, designers and key buildings. This identified the key barrier to be the process of producing the mould for casting the complex geometry GFRC panels. Solutions to resolve them were tested over several stages for each of the main production methods most suited for the manufacture of thin-walled GFRC, namely; the automated premixed method, the premixed method and the sprayed method. The results from the laboratory testing over all the stages, and the prototype structure manufactured with the identified solution from the testing, answered the main research question: How can the manufacture of complex geometry thin-walled GFRC be advanced to meet today’s architectural demands? So, the architectural demands for thin-walled GFRC cladding were identified, together with a clearly defined range of complexity of thin-walled GFRC panels. The key demands were; a smooth surface texture, no visual fibres in the surface, minimal air-bubbles or voids, consistent colour across all thin-walled GRFC elements, no visible cracks, and the need for edge-returns and panel offsets. The suitability of selected production methods were evaluated against these demands. Firstly the automated premixed method was tested on a flexible table, (single reconfigurable mould surface, with computer controlled actuators  capable of forming free-formed geometries). This showed that the flexible table alone would not meet the requirements for an edge-return, with the manufacturing speed required, to produce many unique shaped panels within normal building project time-schedules. Following this test a solution was proposed that used the flexible table to produce free-formed shaped moulds using fast curing foam, enabling moulds to be produced within hours allowing more rapid utilization of the flexible table.   This solution was first tested for the premixed method by casting <b>positive</b> and negative <b>mould</b> parts enabling an edge-return to be cast because flexible tables are only able to produce moulds with a continuous surface. The new mould solution for complex geometry shapes also demonstrated that it was difficult to avoid air-bubbles and voids when casting the GFRC panels using the premixed method. So a second mould solution was developed for the sprayed method. This resolved the challenges of forming an edge-barrier on the mould, while allowing an edge-return to be successfully cast on a double curved panel that met the key architectural demands. From the research and the tests it was possible to devise a fully automated process for the manufacture of complex geometry thin-walled GFRC, comprised of: – Stage 1 : Initial architectural geometric concept. – Stage 2 : Panelization and geometric offsetting. – Stage 3 : Identifying the right production method. – Stage 4 : Casting process. – Stage 5 : Transportation and Installation. Solutions for each of these stages all contributed to advances that will enable current and future free-form thin-walled GFRC architectural designs to be realised. The contribution to knowledge from the tests and the resulting automated process was used to produce the moulds for 9 unique double curved elements to form each row of a 10 m tall self-supporting thin-walled shell. This show-cased how the identified solution enabled a faster and more cost effective method to produce free-form thin-walled GFRC panels. One of the main conclusions of the research showed that the sprayed method currently provides most flexibility in the manufacture of complex geometry thin-walled GFRC panels when the identified architectural demands must be met.   To advance the manufacture of complex geometry thin-walled panels further a fully automated and digital manufacturing process must be developed. As identified in the research this can be done by upgrading current automated premixed production lines by integrating the new solution for complex geometry shaped moulds into the production line and automatically spaying the GFRC onto the mould. When fully developed this fully automated method would enable free-form shell elements to be produced, that may also incorporate insulation, allowing segments for a self-supporting free-form shell to be constructed.   With this research the current architectural knowledge base has been advanced in terms of complex geometry thin-walled GFRC for building envelopes. The identified solutions should allow building with complex geometries to be realised using thin-walled GFRC as the envelope cladding...|$|R
40|$|U provinciji Dalmaciji, odnosno u antičkoj luci u Resniku kod Trogira pronađeno je još jedno - uzdosad tri poznata primjerka (Akvileja, Rim i British Museum) - dobro očuvano dno s reljefnimžigom i imenom Alexandros (Aλεξανδρος). Dno također pripada staklenom vrču četverokutna tijelazelenožućkaste boje. Reljefna slova ispisana su (u pozitivu) unutar dva koncentrična reljefna kruga,kao što je to slučaj kod većine žigova s grčkim imenima na dnu vrčeva kvadratična tijela. U srediničetvrtasta dna vidljiv je otisak alatke za pridržavanje vrča pri obradi gornjeg dijela recipijenta. Slova suvelika, veoma pravilna i čitljiva. Ime staklara doneseno je u genitivu (AΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ). Stakleno dno iz Resnika pokazuje iznimno kvalitetan rad sa slovima grčkog alfabeta koja su odraznaslijeđa helenističke kulture i utjecaja latinske klasične kapitale. Na temelju cijelog niza elemenatasa sigurnošću se može kazati da kvadratični vrč Aleksandrosa nije kasnoantički produkt, a ni produktradionica koje su proizvodile uobičajene kvadratične vrčeve od plavkastog ili plavkastozelenkastogstakla. Grčki alfabet, paleografska analiza i zelenožućkasta boja stakla upućuju na zaključak da jevrijeme nastanka ovih vrčeva sredina 1. stoljeća poslije Krista. Moguće je da je primjerak vrča iz radionice AΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ doplovio u luku Resnik s istočnogMediteran. Vjerojatnije je, međutim, da je on produkt neke italske staklarske radionice, posebno sobzirom na to da masivniji kvadratični vrčevi na Istoku nisu osobito uobičajeni. Relief {{marks on}} antique glass {{recipients}} are extremely interesting for {{research of the}} glass making,regardless {{whether it was a}} sign for a glass workshop, glassmaker or the manufacturer of the contentskept in them. Marks with the manufacturer’s names (or only the initials) are found on the square jugs. As a rulethey were written in Latin alphabet, and so far these were noted on the Croatian coastal area: P(ublius) ACCIUS ALCINUS (or ALCINO), L(ucius) AEMILIUS BLASIUS (or BLASTIUS), C(aius) SALVIUS GRATUS andC(neius) POMPEIUS CASSIANUS, and the initials CSOR. Relief imprints of the names in Greek alphabet {{at the bottom of the}} square - bodied jugs arevery rare. Sixteen Greek names on twenty prismatic jugs, together with one hexagonal and threeoctagonal examples are known in the Roman Empire so far. Another example from the ancient portin Resnik near Trogir should be added to this example. It has a name AΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΣ written in genitiv(AΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ) at the bottom. Alexandros is the most frequent Greek name found so far at the bottom of the jugs with squarebodies. Three examples of bottoms with this name are registered in the Roman Empire. First knownjug with quadratic shaped body with the name Aλεξανδρος that was published in the early 20 thcentury by A. Kisa and M. L. Trowbridge and G. L. Jacobson eventually, originates from Rome. Onesuch bottom was found in Aquileia and one is kept in the British Museum, and is published by S. H. Auth in a note as a comparative example for the octagonal jug kept in the Newark Museum with thename Πριςκος (from Palestine?). Origin of the example from the British Museum is not noted so it ispossible that it was brought from the eastern part of the Empire. Unfortunately, bottom with the reliefmark of this name from Rome was not illustrated, and jug from England was not published at all (as faras I am aware). M. C. Calvi publishes one drawing of the bottom of the Aquileia fi nd, so it can be usedfor the comparative and paleographic analysis of the text (fi gure 1). So, besides the aforementioned three examples, one better-preserved bottom with the relief markwith the name of Alexandros (Aλεξανδρος) was found in the province of Dalmatia, or in the ancientport of Resnik near Trogir. The bottom belongs to the green-yellow glass jug with square body (fi gure 2). Relief letters are written (in positive) within two concentric relief circles, as was the case with mostof the aforementioned marks with Greek names (fi gure 3). Impression of the tool used for holdingthe jug while shaping the upper part of the container can be seen in the centre of the square bottom. Preserved bottom width is 9 x 9 cm. The letters are large, very regular and legible. Their height is about 1. 5 cm. The name of the glassmaker is given in genitive (AΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ) as is the case with all the othermarks with Alexandros’ name on them. The letters of the comparative Aquileian examples are inattentively made, more rustic andirregular compared to the Resnik text. They are written as a refl ection, to be more precise they werestamped as a refl ection on the <b>positive</b> from the <b>mould.</b> Only the letter sigma was made in positive,but it was written as a refl ecting cursive epsilon. Ligature is noticed with the letters ΛE and AN, and itis possible that ligature also had the ending letters of the names in genitive that were not preserved -PO or OY (considering that there was not enough space for the three letters). It is also interesting thatthe Aquileian example has alpha with broken horizontal hasta, as is the case with alpha on the reliefstamp at the bottom from Resnik near Trogir. It is very diffi cult at this stage of research to answer the question in which glass-blowing centresthese square jugs were made. It is possible that in the Early Imperial period numerous glassmakersfrom the east opened their shops on the Italian peninsula, because that is where the largest numberof bottoms of square jugs with Greek names and alphabet were found. However, these bottoms wereusually found with single examples of names, so it is very diffi cult to discuss their place of origin. It ispossible that this Croatian example came to the port of Resnik from the east Mediterranean, possiblySiria, or what is more likely from some Italian workshop. Considering the fact that large number ofjugs with quadratic bodies was not found in the ancient part of the port, it is most probable that the found bottom did not belong to the ship cargo, but it belonged to the ship’s or the crew’s equipment. It is hard to believe based only on one fi nd that the jug was manufactured in ancient Salona. Time of the manufacture of the square jug with stamped name AΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΣ can be defi nedbased on the whole set of elements. As other examples of bottoms with Greek names, this one differsin quality and colour of glass from the usual square jugs popular in the western part of the RomanEmpire that are especially numerous in the area of ancient Zadar (Jader), Nin (Aenona) and Podgrađe(Asseria). These are dated in the second half of the 1 st and the 2 nd century AD. On the other hand, it isanalogous to the rare Early Christian examples with the relief of the Christ’s monogram and the cross,although it is not a product of the 3 rd or 4 th century. Most probably, Aλεξανδρος the glassmaker hadhis workshop where he manufactured also the square jugs with his name around the middle of the 1 st century AD...|$|R
