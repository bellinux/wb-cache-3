40|$|In {{this study}} a design and {{optimization}} of a generator {{to be used}} in free piston applications was made. In order to supply required initial force, an IPM (interior permanent magnets) cavity tube type linear generator was selected. By using analytical equations’ basic dimensioning of generator was made. By using Ansys-Maxwell dimensioning, analysis and optimization of the generator was realized. Also, the effects of design basic variables (<b>pole</b> <b>step</b> ratio, cavity step ratio, inner diameter - outer diameter ratio, primary final length, air interval) on pinking force were examined by using parametric analyses. Among these variables, cavity step ratio, inner diameter - outer diameter ratio, primary final length were optimally determined by algorithm and sequential nonlinear programming. The two methods were compared in terms of pinking force calculation problem. Preliminary application of the linear generator was performed for free piston application...|$|E

60|$|The mustard-seed of a feud {{between the}} two parishes shot into a tall tree in a single night, when Davit Lunan's father went to a tattie roup at Tilliedrum and thoughtlessly died there. Twenty-four hours {{afterwards}} a small party of staid Auld Lichts, carrying long white <b>poles,</b> <b>stepped</b> out of various wynds and closes and picked their solemn way {{to the house of}} mourning. Nanny Low, the widow, received them dejectedly, as one oppressed by the knowledge that her man's death at such an inopportune place did not fulfil the promise of his youth; and her guests admitted bluntly that they were disappointed in Tammas. Snecky Hobart's father's unusually long and impressive prayer was an official intimation that the deceased, in the opinion of the session, sorely needed everything of the kind he could get; and then the silent driblet of Auld Lichts in black stalked off in the direction of Tilliedrum. Women left their spinning-wheels and pirns to follow them with their eyes along the Tenements, and the minister was known to be holding an extra service at the manse.

40|$|Rational {{approximation}} of frequency-domain responses {{is commonly used}} in electromagnetic transients programs for frequency-dependent modeling of transmission lines and to some extent, network equivalents (FDNEs) and transformers. This paper analyses one of the techniques [vector fitting (VF) ] within a general iterative least-squares scheme that also explains the relation with the polynomial-based Sanathanan–Koerner iteration. Two recent enhancements of the original VF formulation are described: orthonormal vector fitting (OVF) which uses orthonormal functions as basis functions instead of partial fractions, and relaxed vector fitting (RVF), which uses a relaxed least-squares normalization for the <b>pole</b> identification <b>step.</b> These approaches have been combined into a single approach: relaxed orthonormal vector fitting (ROVF).

40|$|Cell {{polarization}} is {{an integral}} part of many unrelated bacterial processes. How intrinsic cell polarization is achieved is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that Caulobacter crescentus uses a multimeric pole-organizing factor (PopZ) that serves as a hub to concurrently achieve several polarizing functions. During chromosome segregation, polar PopZ captures the ParB•ori complex and thereby anchors sister chromosomes at opposite <b>poles.</b> This <b>step</b> is essential for stabilizing bipolar gradients of a cell division inhibitor and setting up division near midcell. PopZ also affects polar stalk morphogenesis and mediates the polar localization of the morphogenetic and cell cycle signaling proteins CckA and DivJ. Polar accumulation of PopZ, which is central to its polarizing activity, can be achieved independently of division and does not appear to be dictated by the pole curvature. Instead, evidence suggests that localization of PopZ largely relies on PopZ multimerization in chromosome-free regions, consistent with a self-organizing mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD), {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder, is characterized by marked impairments in motor function caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Animal models of PD have traditionally been based on toxins, such as 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) and 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), that selectively lesion dopaminergic neurons. Motor impairments from 6 -OHDA lesions of SNc neurons are well characterized in rats, but much less work has been done in mice. In this study, we compare the effectiveness of a series of drug-free behavioral tests in assessing sensorimotor impairments in the unilateral 6 -OHDA mouse model, including six tests used {{for the first time in}} this PD mouse model (the automated treadmill " DigiGait" test, the challenging beam test, the adhesive removal test, the pole test, the adjusting steps test, and the test of spontaneous activity) and two tests used previously in 6 -OHDA-lesioned mice (the limb-use asymmetry " cylinder" test and the manual gait test). We demonstrate that the limb-use asymmetry, challenging beam, <b>pole,</b> adjusting <b>steps,</b> and spontaneous activity tests are all highly robust assays for detecting sensorimotor impairments in the 6 -OHDA mouse model.

50|$|Fishing {{has always}} been a {{principal}} occupation for the people of Polperro. For centuries the village was a pilchard fishing and processing port. The fish were drawn to the south Cornwall coast to feed in late summer and brought rich pickings for local fishermen. Once ashore, the fish were salted and pressed and the oil was collected as a by-product and used for heating and lighting. Polperro pilchards were exported to many parts of Europe. Shoals of the fish diminished in the 20th century and pilchard fishing died out in Polperro in the 1960s, but today the port still has around 12 commercial vessels fishing for flat fish, scallops, crabs, monkfish, ray, pollock, bass and cod. The little fishing port of Polperro, 5 miles west of Looe, had a fleet of small sailing fishing boats known as Polperro Gaffers. Their principal catch was the pilchard but this was a late summer catch {{and the rest of the}} year they set long lines, and seine nets.

Jonathan Couch, the village doctor for many years, was also a notable ichthyologist and trained in succession a large number of fishermen to aid him in his pursuits. His observations made at and near Polperro during his lifetime and since his death have not been equalled in value at any British station. He was in correspondence with many of the foremost naturalists, and especially rendered aid to Thomas Bewick and to William Yarrell.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to develop a testing specification on an electrodynamic shaker which ensures the qualification of a parking lighting device, whose pole is impacted by a car. The methodology is based on both a numerical approach and an experimental approach using an electrodynamic shaker. The first step of the analysis consists in modeling the structure and the excitation by means of a finite element approach. The calculation of the dynamic response of the "pole/lighting device " system to impact loading is repeated for different geometries of the <b>pole.</b> The second <b>step</b> is to consider each dynamic response at the fixing point of the lighting device on the pole as input for a base-excited single degree of freedom system. The theory developed for such a system allows to define severity criteria like the Shock Response Spectrum (SRS) which is the most representative criterion {{in the case of an}} impact. The severity of the vibration environment of the lighting device is then obtained by considering the envelope of the different computed SRS. Finally, different test specifications leading to equivalent SRS are proposed and the device is tested on an electrodynamic shaker. The developed methodology was applied to the NEMO lighting device (Schréder) ...|$|R

Topographic information relating to layer thicknesses, erosional processes, and formation of dark spirals within these deposits has been sparce or unreliable until the arrival of MOLA in orbit in September 1997. To assist in evaluating these terrains prior to launch and to assess formation and erosion processes in the polar deposits, we have assembled Viking stereo mosaics {{of the region and}} have produced the first reliable DEM models of the south polar deposits using automated stereogrammetry tools. Here we report our preliminary topographic results, pending final image pointing updates. The maximum total thickness of the layered deposits in the south polar region is 2. 5 km. The thick layered deposits consist of a series of megaterraces.

Terraces are bounded by relatively steep scarps 100 - 500 meters high that face toward the equator.

Several tongue-shaped troughs, with rounded cirquelike heads, are observed near the margins of the deposit.
