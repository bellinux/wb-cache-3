40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop pH sensitive polymethacrylic acid–chitosan–polyethylene glycol (PCP) nanoparticles. This was achieved by dispersion polymerization of methacrylic acid (MAA), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and different chitosan (CS) grades in the presence of cross linking agent ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA) and polymer initiator potassium <b>persulphate.</b> <b>Method</b> development was carried out by varying formulation parameters such as type of CS, ratio of PEG to CS, quantity of solvent and polymer initiator. Metoprolol (MTP) tartrate was incorporated into the nanoparticles (NPs) as a model drug. Laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies revealed that the NPs were spherical with smooth surfaces ranging in size from 190 to 450 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) findings showed the presence of amorphous MTP in PCP NPs. The MTP loading of PCP and glycol chitosan (GC) NPs varied from 10 to 45 % depending on the CS grade while both types of NPs showed excellent binding efficiency on mucin from porcine stomach. The in vitro dissolution study showed pH dependent release profiles suggesting that the PCP NPs system have great potential for oral controlled drug delivery as an alternative to conventional dosage forms...|$|E
40|$|The Cross River State of Nigeria {{was in the}} goiter-endemic or goiter belt of Nigeria {{before the}} {{introduction}} of Universal Salt Iodization (USI) in 1996. After several years of availability and consumption of iodized salt in Nigeria, it has become necessary to revisit some of these previously goiter endemic areas so as to measure the effect of USI on the iodine nutriture, especially since goiter has not completely disappeared. This study was therefore initiated to assess the current iodine status {{of the population in}} relation to the USI programme in The state. Primary school children aged 8 - 12 years were recruited from ten schools in two Local Government Areas (LGA) in the Cross River State, using a simple random sampling technique. Casual, on the spot urine samples were collected from the children and analyzed for urinary iodine using the ammonium <b>persulphate</b> <b>method.</b> Salt samples were also collected from the households {{of the children in the}} study and analyzed for iodine content using titrimetric method. Four hundred school children participated in this study, 200 (50 %) were males and 200 (50 %) were females. One hundred and eighty-eight (47 %) were 12 years old, while 95 (23. 8 %), were 11 years old, 80 (20 %) were 10 years old, 32 (18 %) were 9 years old and 5 (1. 2 %), were 8 years old. Median urinary iodine in these school children was 65 µg/l. Ninety-nine (24. 75 %), had a median urinary iodine of 100 - 299 µg/l consistent with adequate iodine intake, while 136 (34. 0 %) had a median urinary iodine of 50 - 99 µg/l suggesting mild iodine deficiency. Only 92 (23 %) of the children had a mean urinary iodine level less than 20 µg/l, which is consistent with severe iodine deficiency, while 73 (18. 25 %) of them were moderately deficient (20 - 49 µg/). However, the analysis of the table salt from the households showed that 74 % of the households consumed salts with adequate iodine content of greater than 15 ppm. In conclusion, the apparent contradiction observed between adequacy of table salt iodization and urinary iodine levels suggests the possible existence of factors such as improper use of table salt, poor handling by the retailers, high goitrogen content in the diets and cooking methods. These are areas of future research...|$|E
40|$|CDOM {{absorption}} and fluorescence and DOC {{measurements were}} performed during three oceanographic surveys in 1994 in southern Baltic Sea (polish {{area of the}} Baltic Proper). DOC was measured both by high temperature oxidation (HTCO) and conventional <b>persulphate</b> (LTO) <b>methods.</b> CDOM fluorescence was shown to be highly correlated with absorption with the same statistical parameters despite the seasonal change with different hidrographic conditions and the quantum yield variations (1. 23 +- 0. 07 in April and 0. 97 +- 0. 12 in September). The results show a good correlation between the optical parameters and DOC although about 70 % of the DOC does not display significant absorption in the UV-visible range (350 - 750 nm). Although the total non absorbing DOC seems unaffected by seasonal changes, and therefore can be predicted by optical methods using remote sensing techniques, the fraction measured by LTO (DOC lab) varies from 62 % (April) to 76 % (September) as a contribution of the total DOClab, so implying to be estimated on seasonal basis.

40|$|Background & objectives: The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to characterize factors influencing differential productivityof Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes at larval habitats {{in a rural}} village in western Kenya. Methods: Longitudinal larval sampling was done using an area sampler for 3 months. Emerged adults wereidentified to species level morphologically using taxonomic keys and to sub-species by polymerase chain reaction(PCR). Nutrient content was analyzed using <b>persulphate</b> oxidation <b>method.</b> Water pH was measured using anOrion pH/conductivity meter. Turbidity was measured using a Hach 2100 A turbidity meter. Algal count densitywas estimated using a sedge-wick rafter cell. Results: A total 3367 larvae were harvested. Out of 500 adults subjected to PCR analysis 358 (71. 6 %) wereAnopheles gambiae s. s., 127 (25. 4 %) An. arabiensis while PCR amplification failed for 15 (3 %) specimens. Rainwater pools were the most productive habitat type. There was a positive association between algal densityand larval density (p< 0). Total nitrogen, water pH and turbidity were positively correlated with larval density(p< 0. 01) and pH was negatively associated with larval density. Conclusion: Results indicate water nutrient and algal content in larval habitats of An. gambiae play crucial,dual roles in the resource ecology of these mosquitoes. Overall, {{the findings of this}} study support the notion thatanti-larval source reduction measures aimed at manipulating physicochemical variables in larval habitats toeliminate larval production have a chance of succeeding in an integrated vector control program...|$|R
