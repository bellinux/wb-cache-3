40|$|The Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is {{ubiquitous}} emerging {{broadband wireless}} network. However, the open wireless medium, multi-hop multi-radio architecture and ad-hoc connectivity amongst end-users are such characteristics {{which increases the}} vulnerabilities of WMN towards many <b>passive</b> and active <b>attacks.</b> A secure network ensures the confidentiality, integrity and availability of wireless network.

40|$|In the {{analysis}} of many cryptographic protocols, {{it is useful to}} distinguish two classes of attacks: <b>passive</b> <b>attacks</b> in which an adversary eavesdrops on messages sent between honest users and active attacks (i. e., “man-in-the-middle ” attacks) in which — in addition to eavesdropping — the adversary inserts, deletes, or arbitrarily modifies messages sent from one user to another. <b>Passive</b> <b>attacks</b> are well characterized (the adversary’s choices are inherently limited) and techniques for achieving security against <b>passive</b> <b>attacks</b> are relatively well understood. Indeed, cryptographers have long focused on methods for countering <b>passive</b> eavesdropping <b>attacks,</b> and much work in the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s has dealt with formalizing notions of security and providing provably-secure solutions for this setting. On the other hand, active attacks are not well characterized and precise modeling has been difficult. Few techniques exist for dealing with active attacks, and designing practical protocols secure against such attacks remains a challenge. This dissertation considers active attacks {{in a variety of settings}} and provides new, provably-secure protocols preventing such attacks. Proofs of security are in the standard cryptographic model and rely on well-known cryptographic assumptions. The protocols presented here are efficient an...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{analysis}} of trusted platform communication. While the trusted platform module itself is considered reasonably tamper resistant, the communication channel between this module {{and the rest of}} the trusted platform turns out to be comparatively insecure. <b>Passive</b> <b>attacks</b> can be mounted on the communication interface with fairly inexpensive equipment and allow eavesdropping of critical information. Performing active manipulation on the communication bus could provide an even stronger attack scenario, resulting in a circumvention of the whole chain of trust provided by trusted platforms. At this stage, our research has been limited to <b>passive</b> <b>attacks.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|To have {{a better}} {{protection}} against privacy attack, {{it is important to}} understand different types of privacy attack models. In this section, we introduce two categories of <b>attack,</b> active and <b>passive</b> <b>attacks</b> [11, 14].|$|R
50|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>attacks</b> {{are very}} {{difficult}} to detect because they do not involve any alteration of the data. When the messages are exchanged neither the sender nor the receiver is aware that a third party may capture the messages. This can be prevented by encryption of data.|$|R
50|$|An adversary {{can perform}} a <b>passive</b> <b>attack</b> by {{monitoring}} the traffic {{to and from}} the mix network.

5000|$|Controllers are a human-like {{figure with}} an overly large head, that use psi powers {{to attack the}} player, both {{directly}} through a throwing type gesture, when a line of sight can be made. Controllers also use a <b>passive</b> <b>attack,</b> which makes the player woozy and disoriented in short bursts, before flashing red as a warning when one gets too close. Prolonged exposure up close to a Controller will leave the player's vision blurry, {{making it difficult to}} aim for a length of time. The duration varies in severity and recovery depending on how long the player was exposed to the psi powers of a Controller.|$|E

40|$|Mobile Ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) are a {{new paradigm}} of wireless network, offering unrestricted mobility without any underlying infrastructure such as base station or mobile switching centers. Basically ad hoc network {{is a collection of}} nodes communicating with each other by forming a multi-hop network. In a mobile ad hoc network, it is much more vulnerable to attacks than a wired network due to its limited physical security, dynamically changing network topology, energy constrained operations and lack of centralized administration. Since all the nodes in the network collaborate to forward the data, the wireless channel is prone to active and <b>passive</b> <b>attacks</b> by malicious nodes, such as Denial of Service (DoS), eavesdropping, spoofing, etc. The intent {{of this paper is to}} investigate the security goal, security challenges and different types of active and <b>passive</b> <b>attacks</b> on MANETs...|$|R
40|$|In hostile environments, adversaries {{can launch}} <b>passive</b> <b>attacks</b> against interceptable routing {{information}} embedded in routing messages and data packets. Allowing adversaries to trace network routes and infer the motion pattern of nodes {{at the end}} of those routes may pose a serious threat to covert operations. In this paper we propose a feasible adversary model of such attacks, then present several instantiations and study the principles of designing corresponding countermeasures. We demonstrate that existing ad hoc routing protocols are vulnerable to passive attacks: in the feasible adversary model, (a) the location and motion patterns of mobile nodes can be traced, while (b) proactive and reactive/on-demand ad hoc routes across multiple mobile nodes can be visualized by the adversary. We conclude that ad hoc networks deployed in hostile environments need new countermeasures to resist such <b>passive</b> <b>attacks.</b> I...|$|R
50|$|In June 2005, Yaniv Shaked and Avishai Wool {{published}} a paper describing both passive and active methods for obtaining the PIN for a Bluetooth link. The <b>passive</b> <b>attack</b> allows a suitably equipped attacker to eavesdrop on communications and spoof, if the attacker {{was present at}} the time of initial pairing. The active method makes use of a specially constructed message that must be inserted at a specific point in the protocol, to make the master and slave repeat the pairing process. After that, the first method can be used to crack the PIN. This attack's major weakness is that it requires the user of the devices under attack to re-enter the PIN during the attack when the device prompts them to. Also, this active attack probably requires custom hardware, since most commercially available Bluetooth devices are not capable of the timing necessary.|$|E
50|$|In August 2001, Scott Fluhrer, Itsik Mantin, and Adi Shamir {{published}} a cryptanalysis of WEP that exploits {{the way the}} RC4 ciphers and IV are used in WEP, resulting in a <b>passive</b> <b>attack</b> that can recover the RC4 key after eavesdropping on the network. Depending {{on the amount of}} network traffic, and thus the number of packets available for inspection, a successful key recovery could take as little as one minute. If an insufficient number of packets are being sent, there are ways for an attacker to send packets on the network and thereby stimulate reply packets which can then be inspected to find the key. The attack was soon implemented, and automated tools have since been released. It is possible to perform the attack with a personal computer, off-the-shelf hardware and freely available software such as aircrack-ng to crack any WEP key in minutes.|$|E

Backstorm et al. {{pointed out that}} attacker with certain knowledge can easily differentiate the target nodes or edges from the others due to their unique structural information. Most current studies focus their research on preventing passive attacks, which includes: (1) node <b>passive</b> <b>attack</b> [8 – 11], where adversaries are supposed {{to take advantage of}} node’s degree centrality information to uncover node’s identity; (2) edge <b>passive</b> <b>attack</b> [13 – 15], where adversaries are supposed to know the existence of certain edges, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information by tracking the identify of other edges or nodes via known edges; (3) sub-graph <b>passive</b> <b>attack</b> [9, 11, 12], where adversaries are supposed to make use of sub-graph information known in advanced to identify sensitive information of node, such as node identity; (4) graph metrics <b>passive</b> <b>attack</b> [16], where the adversaries have certain background knowledge of the graph metrics, for example hub fingerprint, closeness centrality or betweenness centrality. With the knowledge of these graph metrics, it’s also possible that adversaries can uncover several sensitive information of the social network.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. New {{trends in}} {{consumer}} electronics {{have created a}} strong demand for fast, reliable and user-friendly key agreement protocols. However, many key agreement protocols are secure only against <b>passive</b> <b>attacks.</b> Therefore, message authentication is often unavoidable {{in order to achieve}} security against active adversaries. Pasini and Vaudenay were the first to propose a new compelling methodology for message authentication. Namely, their two-party protocol uses short authenticated strings (SAS) instead of pre-shared secrets or public-key infrastructure that are classical tools to achieve authenticity. In this article, we generalise this methodology for multi-party settings. We give a new group message authentication protocol that utilises only limited authenticated communication and show how to combine this protocol with classical key agreement procedures. More precisely, we describe how to transform any group key agreement protocol that is secure against <b>passive</b> <b>attacks</b> into a new protocol that is secure against active attacks...|$|R
