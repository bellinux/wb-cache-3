5|$|The ship {{also participated}} in the main attack on the Dardanelles forts on 18 March. This time a 6-inch (152mm) {{howitzer}} battery opened fire on Agamemnon and hit her 12 times in 25 minutes; five of the howitzer shells hit her armour and did no damage, but the seven that hit outside her armour protection did considerable structural damage and temporarily <b>put</b> <b>one</b> of her 12-inch (305-mm) guns out of action.|$|E
5|$|On 18 June, Braathens SAFE {{announced}} that starting on 27 October, the company <b>put</b> <b>one</b> aircraft into {{service on the}} route from Oslo to Stockholm. SAS {{had at the time}} fifteen round trips on the route, and Braathens planned to introduce seven. The route was {{considered one of the most}} profitable for SAS. The purchase of Transwede was confirmed on 25 June; Braathens SAFE bought 50% of the company's scheduled division, Transwede Airways, with an option to purchase the rest in 1997. The companies planned to integrate their networks, to allow connection between Braathens SAFE's and Transwede flights at Stockholm. Services to Stockholm started on 6 November; after three months, the airline had captured 14% of the Oslo–Stockholm market. In 1996, Braathens SAFE had a 51% domestic market share in Norway, transporting 9.5 million passengers.|$|E

5|$|There was no Whig platform—the {{party leaders}} decided {{that trying to}} <b>put</b> <b>one</b> {{together}} would tear the party apart. So the Whigs ran on their opposition to Van Buren, blaming him and his Democrats for the recession. In campaign materials, Tyler was praised for integrity in resigning over the state legislature's instructions. The Whigs initially hoped to muzzle Harrison and Tyler, lest they make policy statements that alienated segments of the party. But after Tyler's Democratic rival, Vice President Johnson, made a successful speaking tour, Tyler was called upon to travel from Williamsburg to Columbus, Ohio, and there address a local convention, in a speech intended to assure Northerners that he shared Harrison's views. In his journey of nearly two months, Tyler made speeches at rallies. He could not avoid questions, and after being heckled into an admission that he supported the Compromise Tariff (many Whigs did not), resorted to quoting from Harrison's vague speeches. In his two-hour speech at Columbus, Tyler entirely avoided {{the issue of the}} Bank of the United States, one of the major questions of the day.|$|E

25|$|Two {{days after}} the draw with Notre Dame, the Cougars {{traveled}} to Lexington, Kentucky to face the UK Wildcats, {{a team that was}} ranked most of last season.

25|$|Soon illegal stag films or blue films, as {{they were}} called, were {{produced}} underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their bathtubs to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesman but being caught viewing or possessing them <b>put</b> <b>one</b> {{at the risk of}} prison.|$|E
25|$|Narathihapate's death officially {{marked the}} end of the two-and-a-half-century-old Pagan Empire. The country was in chaos, with each region {{claiming}} a king. Now, the dowager queen, Hla Wun managed to return to Pagan, hoping to restore the kingdom. At Pagan, she became the leader of the remaining old court. A year and half after her husband's death, on 30 May 1289, she <b>put</b> <b>one</b> of Narathihapate's sons, Kyawswa, on the throne. For some reason, she did not choose her only son (and child) Yazathu as king.|$|E

25|$|The special {{property}} of entanglement {{can be better}} observed if we separate the said two particles. Let's <b>put</b> <b>one</b> {{of them in the}} White House in Washington and the other in UC Berkeley (think about this as a thought experiment, not an actual one). Now, if we measure a particular characteristic of one of these particles (say, for example, spin), get a result, and then measure the other particle using the same criterion (spin along the same axis), we find that the result of the measurement of the second particle will match (in a complementary sense) the result of the measurement of the first particle, in that they will be opposite in their values.|$|E
25|$|These are baby {{carriers}} {{that use}} dynamic tension, {{a length of}} cloth and metal (such as aluminum) or nylon rings. One end of the cloth is sewn to two rings. The cloth wraps around the wearer's body from shoulder to opposite hip and {{back up to the}} shoulder, and the end is threaded through the rings to create a buckle effect. The baby sits or lies in the resulting pocket. Once a sling is threaded, it can be taken off and put back on without rethreading. A threaded sling forms a loop of cloth. The wearer can <b>put</b> <b>one</b> arm and the head through the loop of cloth to put the sling back on.|$|E
25|$|This {{speculation}} {{also involves}} theories concerning whether Mallory and Irvine could {{have managed to}} climb the Second Step. Òscar Cadiach {{was the first to}} climb it in 1985 free and rated it V+. Conrad Anker led an experiment to free climb this section without using the “Chinese ladder” for assistance, since that equipment was not installed in 1924. In 1999, he did not manage a complete free climb as he <b>put</b> <b>one</b> foot briefly on the ladder when it blocked the only available foothold. At that time he rated the difficulty of the Second Step as 5.10—well outside of Mallory's capability. In June 2007, Anker returned {{as a member of the}} Altitude Everest Expedition 2007, and with Leo Houlding successfully free-climbed the Second Step, after removing the “Chinese ladder” (which was later replaced). Houlding rated the climb at 5.9, just within Mallory's estimated capabilities. Theo Fritsche climbed the step free solo on-sight in 2001 and rated it V+.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} of the room has other signs of wealth; the brass chandelier is large and elaborate by contemporary standards, {{and would have been}} very expensive. It would probably have had a mechanism with pulley and chains above, to lower it for managing the candles (possibly omitted from the painting for lack of room). The convex mirror at the back, in a wooden frame with scenes of The Passion painted behind glass, is shown larger than such mirrors could actually be made at this date – another discreet departure from realism by van Eyck. There is also no sign of a fireplace (including in the mirror), nor anywhere obvious to <b>put</b> <b>one.</b> Even the oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may {{have been one of the}} items dealt in by Arnolfini. Further signs of luxury are the elaborate bed-hangings and the carvings on the chair and bench against the back wall (to the right, partly hidden by the bed), also the small Oriental carpet on the floor by the bed; many owners of such expensive objects placed them on tables, as they still do in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|On 7 April 1779, a {{few weeks}} after his {{ordination}} as a priest of the Church of England, Hackman followed Martha Ray to Covent Garden, where she had gone to watch a performance of Isaac Bickerstaffe's comic opera Love in a Village with her friend and fellow singer Caterina Galli. Suspecting that Ray had a new lover, when Hackman saw her in the theatre with William Hanger, 3rd Baron Coleraine, he left, fetched two pistols, and waited in a nearby coffee house. After Ray and Galli came out of the theatre, Hackman approached the ladies just as they were about to get into their carriage. He <b>put</b> <b>one</b> pistol to Ray's forehead and shot her dead. With the other he then tried to kill himself but made only a flesh wound. He then beat himself with both discharged pistols until he was arrested and taken, with Martha Ray's body, into a tavern in St James's Street. Two letters were found on Hackman, one addressed to his brother-in-law, Frederick Booth, and a love letter to Martha Ray: both later appeared in evidence at the murder trial.|$|E
25|$|Reynier's troops {{moved out}} {{on the morning of}} 9 March. They were favored by a wind which blew snow {{in the eyes of the}} defenders. The French general <b>put</b> <b>one</b> brigade in his front line, {{organized}} a flanking column to turn the Neapolitan right flank, and posted Verdier in charge of the reserve. It was 3:00 PM before all was ready. In single file, Reynier's light infantry negotiated the cliffs on Damas' right flank and eventually came out behind their adversaries. They spread into a swarm of skirmishers and attacked, sowing confusion. Meanwhile, General of Brigade Louis Fursy Henri Compère led the frontal assault. The main attack first engaged the Neapolitans in a musketry duel then stormed forward to capture one of the redoubts. The Neapolitan line unraveled and the men bolted for the exit defile. Soon the pass was choked by fleeing soldiers, allowing the French to capture about 2,000 of their enemies, including two generals. In the Battle of Campo Tenese, Neapolitan casualties numbered 3,000, while all their artillery and baggage was captured. French losses were unknown but light. This action finished the Neapolitan armies.|$|E
