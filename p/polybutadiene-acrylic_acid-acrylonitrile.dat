40|$|The {{structural}} dynamics of solid rockets in-general was studied. A review is given of {{the modes of}} vibration and bending that can exist for a solid propellant rocket, and a NASTRAN computer model is included. Also studied were the dynamic properties of a solid propellant, <b>polybutadiene-acrylic</b> <b>acid-acrylonitrile</b> terpolymer, which {{may be used in}} the space shuttle rocket booster. The theory of viscoelastic materials (i. e, Poisson's ratio) was employed in describing the dynamic properties of the propellant. These studies were performed for an eventual booster stage development program for the space shuttle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{single-edge}} cracked uniaxial specimens with {{an initial}} crack length of 0. 1 in. or 0. 3 in. and wedge-shaped sheet specimens {{with an initial}} crack length of 0. 3 in were tested at a constant displacement rate of 50 in/min under 1000 psi confining pressure. The specimens were made of a highly filled polymeric material, containing 86 % by weight of hard particles embedded in a rubbery matrix, which was made of <b>polybutadiene-acrylic</b> <b>acid-acrylonitrile</b> rubber. The uniaxial crack growth data were used to develop a crack growth model, relating crack growth rate da/dt and Mode I stress intensity factor KI. The developed crack growth model was used to predict the crack growth behavior in the wedge-shaped specimen. The results of the analysis indicated that the predicted crack growth rate compared well with the experimen...|$|E
