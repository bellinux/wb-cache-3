50|$|The Printing Unit {{consists}} {{of many different}} systems. The dampening system is used to apply dampening solution to the plates with water rollers. The inking system uses rollers to deliver ink {{to the plate and}} blanket cylinders to be transferred to the substrate.

50|$|One {{factor that}} will affect {{viscosity}} is temperature. By removing {{the water from the}} offset process, there is a loss of its cooling effect {{on the surface of the}} plate.

Because of the higher initial viscosities of the waterless inks there is also a secondary heat generation in the roller train caused by the friction of milling the ink through the rollers.|$|E

40|$|This {{data set}} {{contains}} raw sensor signals of four analogue sensors and five features derived from them. These {{are used to}} monitor the condition of a printing unit in a demonstrator application and to detect a sensor defect, which is simulated in the data set. The demonstrator is used to simulate the wiping process of an Intaglio printing process. Intaglio is the major printing process to produce security prints like banknotes. Engraved structures in the printing plates, which are mounted on a rotating <b>plate</b> <b>cylinder,</b> are filled with ink, which is transferred onto the printing substrate under high pressure. A second cylinder denoted by wiping cylinder, which is working in the printing unit, is lubricated with a solvent to wipe off surplus ink from the printing plates by rotating in the direction opposite to the <b>plate</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This process is crucial as wiping errors immediately lead to print errors. The printing unit demonstrator contains models of the two cylinders, which are turned by electric drives. Pressure between the wiping cylinder having a rubber surface and the steel-surfaced <b>plate</b> <b>cylinder</b> is freely adjustable. A set of four analogue sensors (contact force, solid-bourne sound, electric current of wiping and <b>plate</b> <b>cylinder</b> drives) continuously acquire data during operation to monitor the process. The sensors each output a continuous voltage signal {{in the range of}} [- 10, 10] V, which is proportional to the respective quantity the sensor is observing. Thus, each signal's unit is irrelevant and abandoned as changes of the original quantity of interest are reflected also in the respective voltage signal. All output time-domain signals are synchronously and equidistantly sampled at a frequency of 20 kHz and quantised with a resolution of 16 bit. The acquired data is then split into non-overlapping batches of 50000 samples (corresponding to 2. 5 sec of operation), respectively. The length of the time frame was chosen to ensure that 3 revolutions of the <b>plate</b> <b>cylinder</b> are captured in each signal data batch. The solid-bourne sound signal is treated by the FFT to determine its frequency spectrum per signal batch. Altogether, 5 features per <b>plate</b> <b>cylinder</b> revolution are extracted. This results in 15 feature values per signal data batch. The extracted features are: 	contact force mean: arithmetic mean of the contact force, 	solid-bourne sound intensity: root mean square of the solid-bourne sound, 	solid-bourne sound maxPowFreqInd: index of the frequency component with largest power, 	motor current wiping cylinder mean: arithmetic mean of the wiping cylinder motor current, 	motor current <b>plate</b> <b>cylinder</b> mean: arithmetic mean of the <b>plate</b> <b>cylinder</b> motor current. Each <b>plate</b> <b>cylinder</b> revolution is represented by one instance in the feature data sets. That is, every instance in the data set is described by a vector of 5 feature values. The raw data and feature data sets are divided into two parts, each containing data of one of the two experiments under different operation conditions: 	Static printing unit demonstrator operation: 	The static experiment observes the printing unit demonstrator during 20 : 13 min of operation. The printing unit demonstrator was started immediately before the data acquisition began. No additional manipulations or events occurred during the experiment. Therefore, only data representing the demonstrator's normal condition is contained in the data set. It contains 10, 000, 000 raw signal samples resulting in 600 instances (<b>plate</b> <b>cylinder</b> revolutions), which are in summary described by 3, 000 feature values. 	Manipulated printing unit demonstrator operation: 	The printing unit demonstrator was started ca. 23 : 00 min before the data acquisition began. During this 10 : 31 min long experiment, the demonstrator application was intentionally manipulated. In addition, the solid-bourne sound sensor signal was manipulated through low-pass filtering in order to simulate a defect of this sensor. An unintended incident also occurred during this experiment. Therefore, data representing both the demonstrator's normal and abnormals conditions are contained in the data set. The sequence of events along with an objective classification of the demonstrator condition by the human experimenter is summarised in the file PrintingUnit_manip_events. txt. The data set contains 5, 950, 000 raw signal samples, which are in summary described by 1, 785 feature values. File name conventions and contents The files in the data set are organised such that each row represents a data set instances, columns represent the respective sensor or feature: 	PrintingUnitData*. csv: These files contain raw sensor signals. 	PrintingUnitFeatures*. csv: These files contain the features extracted from the sensor signals. Additional files contain information about 	*_condition. csv: The condition if the printing unit is indicated by 'n' (normal condition) or 'a' (abnormal condition).
