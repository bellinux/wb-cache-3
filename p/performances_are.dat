5|$|Athletes <b>performances</b> <b>are</b> timed or {{measured}} at virtually all {{track and field}} competitions. Doing so can not only serve {{as a way of}} determining the winner in an event, {{but it can also be}} used for historical comparison (i.e. a record). A large variety of record types exist and men's and women's <b>performances</b> <b>are</b> recorded separately. The foremost types of records organise athlete's performances by the region they representâ€”beginning with national records, then continental records, up to the global or world record level. National governing bodies control the national record lists, the area associations organise their respective continental lists, and the IAAF ratifies world records.|$|E

30|$|<b>Performance</b> <b>is</b> a {{commonly}} used concept in various fields. Usually, <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> {{a measure of}} how well a process can achieves its purpose. Measuring <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> a multi-dimensional concept. Traditional <b>performances</b> <b>were</b> too historical and regressive (Ittner, Larcher & Meyer, 2003) as they do not link subjective performances to objective numbers. Objective and an non-objective measures must be associated to fit within a strategic framework (Drucker, 1990; Mcnair and Mosconi, 1987). The empirical literature reports a high diversity of performance indicators (Combs, Crook & Shook, 2005) and the common distinctions are objective and subjective measures.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} board characteristics and CEO compensation on firm performance when firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> adjusted for the effect of earnings management. Results from regression analysis indicates that the CEO pay-performance relation is substantially lower when firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> adjusted for the effect of earnings management than when firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> measured as reported <b>performance.</b> That <b>is,</b> {{the positive effect of}} executive compensation on firm performance disappears when firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> measured as adjusted firm performance excluding earnings management in Chinese listed firms, and as a result, we can identify that the evident executive pay-performance relation is largely cosmetic. We also find that the proportion of independent directors on board is significantly positively associated with firm performance only when the firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> adjusted for the effect of earnings management. Similar results are found in ownership concentration too. These results suggest that independent directors are shown as more effective governance mechanism in Chinese listed firms when true firm <b>performance</b> <b>is</b> considered while the positive effect of CEO compensation disappears concerning true firm performance...|$|R

5|$|The {{main purpose}} for kulintang {{music in the}} {{community}} is to function as social entertainment at a nonprofessional, folk level. This music is unique {{in that it is}} considered a public music in the sense everyone is allowed to participate. Not only do the players play, but audience members are also expected to participate. These <b>performances</b> <b>are</b> important in that they bring people in the community and adjacent regions together, helping unify communities that otherwise may not have interacted with one another. Traditionally, when performers play kulintang music, their participation is voluntary. Musicians see performances as an opportunity to receive recognition, prestige and respect from the community and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|The opera was {{frequently}} revised, most particularly in 1717 and in 1731; modern <b>performances</b> <b>are</b> usually a conflation of the versions available. Up {{to and including}} 1717, these changes had no {{significant effect on the}} plot. In the 1731 version, however, in Act 2 Armida imitates Almirena's voice rather than assuming her appearance, and Argante declares his love to Almirena's portrait rather than to her face. In Act 3 the marches and the battle scene are cut; Armida and Argante remain unrepentant and vanish in a chariot drawn by dragons before the conclusion.|$|E
