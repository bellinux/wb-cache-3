Methyllithium is a special case, in which solvation with ether, or <b>polar</b> <b>additive</b> HMPA does not deaggregate the tetrameric structure in the solid state. On the other hand, THF deaggregates hexameric butyl lithium: the tetramer is the major species, and ΔG for interconversion between tetramer and dimer is around 11 kcal/mol. TMEDA can also chelate to the lithium cations in n-butyllithium and form solvated dimers such as LiBu-n)2. Phenyllithium has been shown to exist as a distorted tetramer in the crystallized ether solvate, and as a mixture of dimer and tetramer in ether solution.|$|E

40|$|MasterIn {{the first}} part of the thesis, a new electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumping method for {{dielectric}} liquids is presented. These methods rely on the non-uniformed-field EHD (NUF-EHD) flow generated by electric-field dependent electrical conductivity (Onsager effect). A <b>polar</b> <b>additive</b> plays an important role in enhancing the field-dependency of conductivity. When ac voltage is applied, a fast and regular flow was produced around electrodes. Flow speed is proportional to cube of electric-field strength and inversely to applied frequency.

In the second part of the thesis, a preliminary numerical investigation is performed to apply the NUF-EHD flow to improve the mixing of fluids.

Sixty polar analytes were first screened to identify those most suitable for inclusion in chromatographic test mixtures; then, a multi-dimensional method development study was conducted to determine the optimal choice of stationary phase, modifier additive and temperature for the separation of such analytes using SFC. The test mixtures were separated on a total of twelve different column chemistries at three different temperatures, using CO 2 -methanol-based mobile phases containing a variety of <b>polar</b> <b>additives.</b> Chromatographic performance was evaluated with a particular emphasis on peak capacity, overall resolution, peak distribution and repeatability.

Measurements of electrical resistance give {{an indication of the}} amount of direct metal/metal contact, while electrical capacitance provides the separation between the surfaces. From the theory of capacitance it is known that electrical capacitance increases with decreasing film thickness, making it very suitable for studies in the thin film region. Measurements of film thickness by electrical capacitance were successfully performed by the authors on both glass/steel and steel/steel contacts with a nonpolar lubricant for films thinner than 20 nm.

The development of high-volume manufacturing processes to prototype PEM fuel cell components with a reduced {{number of steps}} is vital to reduce system cost and complexity, and {{to meet the demands}} of high volume production and durability requirements especially for automotive applications. The strong ionic associations in ionomers act generally as physical cross-links, increasing by several orders of magnitude both melt-viscosities and relaxation times, resulting in ionomeric materials that are very difficult to melt-process with high shear rate processes such as melt-casting or melt-blowing. The strength of the ionic interactions in ionomers, and hence their physical and mechanical properties, depends on the acidity of the pendent anion. Polymers modified with the stronger acid, such as sulfonic acid (pKa 1), exhibit more dramatic changes in thermal, viscoelastic, and rheological properties than those modified with the weaker carboxylic acid (pKa 4 - 5). However, most ionomers may be melt-processed in very low shear rate operations such as compression-molding, which reveals that these ionic associations are not permanent cross-links and can be reversibly disrupted under suitable conditions. The approach investigated is based on the use of selected bi-functional additives that act as a SO 3 H groups protec and a melt-processing aid.

40|$|ZDPs (zinc dialkylphosphates) are sulphur-free analogues of the {{conventional}} antiwear additives ZDDPs (zinc dialkyldithiophosphates). Recently, the application of ZDPs in practical use has been investigated as an alternative of ZDDPs. The key benefit of ZDPs {{is that they do}} not contain sulphur which may damage some catalysts in after-treatment exhaust systems. Utilizing ZDPs instead of ZDDPs contributes to decrease in sulphur content in engine oils. In addition, ZDP-formulated oils show better base number retention than ZDDPs, which could contribute to prolongation of engine oil life. This is because ZDPs do not generate sulphuric acid in their decomposition process, while ZDDPs generate sulphuric acid which consumes detergents. However there is still little known about the mechanism of action of ZDPs as antiwear additives. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to clarify how ZDP antiwear additives work by investigating the film forming and friction properties of ZDPs. The main technique employed was MTM-SLIM (mini traction machine - spacer layer interferometry). This machine can measure friction properties under various rubbing conditions and monitor film formation by additives during rubbing tests. This study has shown that ZDPs form stable reaction films by rubbing, which protect metal surfaces from wear. This is fundamentally similar to the mechanism for antiwear performance of ZDDPs. However, some differences between ZDPs and ZDDPs are seen in their filmforming properties, which may affect their antiwear performances. For example, the filmforming rates of ZDPs are slower than those of ZDDPs at the initial stage. Stabilized films formed by ZDPs are thinner than films formed by ZDDPs. By contrast, ZDPs show similar friction properties to ZDDPs. In the boundary and mixed lubrication regions, there is no noticeable difference in friction between stabilized films formed by ZDPs and ZDDPs. In addition, these properties are largely affected by various factors such as rubbing conditions, concentrations, and alkyl structures of the additives. For example, ZDPs having linear alkyl chains show slower film formation and lower boundary friction than ZDPs having branched alkyl chains. Moreover, other additives such as dispersants and detergents largely affect the properties of ZDPs. Generally, highly <b>polar</b> <b>additives</b> appear to retard the film formation of ZDPs. The mechanisms for the above features are also discussed in this thesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Polyolefins are {{the number}} one commercially {{produced}} polymeric material by volume, and find ubiquitous uses as plastics, elastomers, and fibers. They are produced from gaseous olefins such as ethylene and propylene {{by the action of}} a transition metal catalyst. Despite tremendous academic and industrial efforts and successes in catalyst development over the past decades, the copolymerization of polar functionalized olefins with sufficiently high activities still remains a largely unsolved issue. Late transition metal catalysts were shown to be more suitable for this kind of polymerization reaction due to their generally lower oxophilic character. The main goal of this thesis was the development of novel late transition olefin polymerization catalysts based on ruthenium and palladium. Prior to this work, only few active olefin polymerization Ru-catalysts were reported. Several series of complexes based on ruthenium were synthesized, characterized and investigated for olefin polymerization. Ru(II) -complexes of the type RuCl 2 (N,N,N) L with facially coordinating nitrogen donor ligands (N,N,N = trispyridyl-, trispyrazoyl-, trisimidazoyl-methane derivatives) were found to be inactive towards ethylene polymerization. Employing bisanionic disulfonate phosphines as ligands gave Ru-complexes that produced linear, high-molecular weight polyethylene in the presence of an aluminum-alkyl based cocatalyst. Increasing the electrophilicity of the complex, by decreasing the donor strength of the ligand and using higher oxidation state Ru(IV) -complexes, the polymerization activity could be increased, and one of the highest activities for any Ru-based catalyst was observed. <b>Polar</b> <b>additives</b> such as acetone fully inhibited even the most electron-rich catalysts and copolymerization reactions yielded no polymer. In a different approach to solve the same problem, Pd-diimine complexes were modified with pendant olefin and boronate groups. Pd-diimine complexes can facilitate the copolymerization of ethylene with acrylates, and interactions of the pendant Lewis acid group with the functional, Lewis basic comonomer was anticipated to increase catalyst activity. However, no effect of a pendant pinacol boronate was observed on the incorporation ratio of methyl acrylate in room temperature copolymerizations. The ability of the pendant olefin to coordinate to cationic Pd-species resulted in hemilabile effects. Increased catalyst stability at the cost of decreased activities was found in comparison with unfunctionalized ligands...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the relationship between morphology and properties of non polar polymers {{in the presence of}} <b>polar</b> <b>additives</b> of different nature. The addi- tion of the physical gel dibenzylidene sorbitol (DBS) in a polyethylene (PE) blend has shown to act as a nucleation site on the polymer. Electron microscopy was used to reveal the fibrillar network formed by the DBS and its interaction with the PE. Moreover, the nucleation density in each material was obtained {{as a function of the}} crystallization temperature, which showed an increase in the number of nuclei in the clarified system compared to the unclarified one. However, this was found to be temperature dependent. The nucleation of PE on DBS was also studied through the induction time, which revealed a reduced surface energy of the polymer nucleus in the presence of the DBS. Space charge measurements were taken {{to investigate the}} charge transport in PE/DBS blends and the space charge at low concentration of the gelator was found to improve the space charge distribution. The same polyethylene blend has then been studied also upon addition of relatively polar ethylene/ vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA), with a VA content varying from 9 % to 40 %. Morphology studies showed that three main factors control the phase separation, namely the the time the blend is kept in the melt, the PE:EVA ratio and also the EVA molecular weight. However, breakdown testing demonstrated that the polarity of EVA decreased the breakdown strength of the blends, independently on the morphology. Finally, a preliminary study was conducted with EVA based nanocomposites to determine the effect of filler on the dielectric properties of the nanocomposite. Two relatively polar copolymers, EVA 9 and EVA 18, were processed by solution blending together with 5 % of o-MMT (I 30 P and I 44 PA), and the time of solution blending was varied from 10 min to 100 min. X-ray scattering data showed intercalation in the case of EVA 9 based anocomposites and potential exfoliation for EVA 18 based nanocomposites. However, X-ray results suggest that the solution blending could extract a fraction of the organo-modified ions from in between the MMT galleries, leading to shrinkage of the clay spacing. The nanocomposite was also analysed from the point of view of its breakdown properties, which were shown to be unaffected by the presence of fillers.

40|$|The {{lubricants}} of {{the future}} {{have to be more}} environmentally adapted, show a higher level of performance, and give a lower total life cycle cost (LCC) than the lubricants that are used today. One way to be able to produce, choose and formulate these lubricants is to have good knowledge about the properties of the base fluids and their additive response. The base fluid properties can be divided into four different groups, i. e. physical, chemical, film formation properties and additive response. This thesis is based on the results from the Swedish HiMeC research project "Environmentally adapted lubricants for high performance components". A number of different environmentally adapted ester fluids, suitable for formulation of environmentally adapted lubricants were investigated according to properties, molecular structure and film formation capability. I t was found that both thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity are high for the esters compared to mineral fluids. There is a strong correlation between the number of carboxylate groups and the thermal conductivity. The film formation capability was investigated by the use of optical interferometry in a ball and disc apparatus. A new model for measuring the running in performance of mechanical components was developed. The tests are run un-accelerated, with the same contact pressure and speed as the real applications they represent. The method is based on a tribotest and exact measurement of the surface topography at the exact same spot before and after the test. The most interesting parameters to monitor were found to be Rdq and Rpk. It was found that even very small changes at the uppermost parts of the topography can be measured and monitored whit this method. The additive response for both traditional anti wear additives and specially designed more <b>polar</b> <b>additives</b> where studied. The test where performed at Iwate University in Japan. A modified Falex pin and vee block tribotest machine where used. It was found that the new type of additives is efficient but {{further research is needed to}} be able to formulate fluid based on this chemistry. When putting all together, it could be seen that it will be possible to tailor make base fluids with suitable properties and additivate them with the correct additives for the task they should perform. That will make it possible to achieve better results than the fluids used to day in both environmental and performance aspects. Godkänd; 2006; 20070315 (evan...|$|R
40|$|Photolysis of {{complexes}} of {{dimethyl sulfoxide}} (DMSO) with chlorine atoms results in rapid and permanent photobleaching {{which may be}} due to intramolecular hydrogen abstraction. The effects of solvent polarity were examined {{in a wide variety of}} DMSO–carbon tetrachloride mixed solvents. The quantum yields of photobleaching decreased from 0. 27 to 0. 08 as the solvent polarity increased, while significant changes were observed in the low DMSO concentration range (< 0. 2 mol dm− 3). This cannot be accounted for by simple solvent polarity effects. The effects of <b>polar</b> and nonpolar <b>additives</b> were also examined and it is concluded that the specific solvation effect of DMSO was the main cause of the significant change in quantum yields in the low concentration range of DMSO...|$|R
