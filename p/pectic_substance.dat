In order to make the pectic substances selectively dense to electrons, they were first reacted with basic hydroxylamine. This treatment produces pectic hydroxamic acids, which in turn were treated with ferric ion to form insoluble complexes. The tissue was imbedded, sectioned, and then observed by electron microscopy. Dense deposits of iron were found in the region of the middle lamclla and in a second area near the surface of the primary wall. Transverse walls of varying maturity were noted. The pectin of the more frequent, immature crosswalls, leads direcdy into the inner reacting layer of the axillary (longitudinal) wall.

Many of the important properties of these fibres, such as tensile strength, moisture and dye absorption, and viscosity in cuprammonium solution have frequently been considered as related to the presence of small quantities of pectin. In order to study this relation-ship in greater detail, it was necessary to develop a method for the quantitative estimation of pectin or its constituent uronic acids. Available methods, based on the evolution of carbon dioxide during treatment of the uronic acid with a boiling solution of hydrochloric acid, were found to fail when cellulose or other carbohydrate materials were present, since these substances also decompose with the evolution of some carbon dioxide. An investigation of the rates of evolution of carbon dioxide showed that pure uronic acids evolved carbon dioxide at a rapid rate and that the evolution of gas was complete in several hours. On the other hand, carbohydrates, free of uronic acids, evolved carbon dioxide at a much slower but approximately con-stant rate during the entire treatment.

As a summary it was concluded that the investigated pectins can be easily extracted and successfully used as natural colorants or antioxidants since they have adequate antioxidant activity, total phenol and anthocyanin content and suitable color coordinates...|$|R
30|$|Pectinase enzymes {{commonly}} {{represent a}} group of enzymes that involves in degradation of pectin. Pectins are the high molecular weight polysaccharides, primarily composed of α- 1  →  4 linked D galacturonic acid residues with {{a small number of}} rhamnose residues in the main chain and arabinose, galactose and xylose on its side chain (Rangarajan et al. 2010). Pectin is found in middle lamella and primary cell wall of higher plants in the form of calcium pectate and magnesium pectate (Favela-Torress et al. 2003). It gives rigidity to plant. The amount of <b>pectic</b> <b>substances</b> present in plant materials varies (0.5 – 4.0  % of fresh weight plant material) depending upon the source of plant materials (Jayani et al. 2005; Sakai et al. 1993). During the developing stage of plants, the structure of these <b>pectic</b> <b>substances</b> is altered due to the activity of pectinases. These enzymes facilitate the cell wall extension and softening of some tissues during maturation of the part of plants such as fruits.|$|R
40|$|Total {{amount of}} the pectdc {{substances}} and their fractions was estimated in wheat of several lodging and non-lodging varieties during the flowering stage. The node tissues contained {{three times as much}} total <b>pectic</b> <b>substances</b> as did internodes. Irrespective of the wheat variety, the nodes as compared to the internodes, contain three times as much soluble pectins, and two times as much protopectin fraction extractable at pH 4. 5 as well as those extractable at pH 10. 6. Non-lodging varieties ('Grana', 'Luna', 'Modzurowska') are characterized by high content of <b>pectic</b> <b>substances</b> both in nodes and internodes, high content of calcium and magnesium protopectin fractions are also characteristic of nodes and internodes of these varieties. The lowest content of calcium-magnesium protopectins is found in the in ternodes of tall, lodging wheat varieties. Nitrogen fertilization, up to 80 kg N/ha, does not influence the internode levels of calcium-magnesium protopectin fractions, ash substances, and the levels of calcium and magnesium in this tissue...|$|R
