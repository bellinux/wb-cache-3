40|$|Today’s Internet hosts are {{threatened}} by large scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. The Path Iden-tification (Pi) DDoS defense scheme has been recently proposed as a deterministic packet marking scheme that allows a DDoS victim to filter out attack packets on a per packet basis with high accuracy {{after only a few}} attack packets are received [39]. In this paper, we propose the StackPi marking, a new packet marking scheme based on Pi, and new filtering mechanisms. The StackPi marking scheme consists of two new marking methods that substantially improve Pi’s incremental deployment performance: Stack based marking and Write-ahead marking. Our scheme almost completely eliminates the effect of legacy touters in small quantities and performs 2 - 4 times better than the original Pi scheme with large quantities. For the filtering mechanism, we derive an optimal threshold strategy for filtering with the <b>Pi</b> <b>marking.</b> We also develop a new filter, the PilPfilter, which can be used to detect IP spoofing attacks with just a single attack packet. Finally, we discuss in detail StackPi’s compatibility with IP Fragmentation, applicability in an IPv 6 environment...|$|E
40|$|Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks {{continue}} to plague the Internet. Defense against these attacks {{is complicated by}} spoofed source IP addresses,which {{make it difficult to}} determine a packet 2 ̆ 7 s true origin. We propose Pi (short for Path Identifier), a new packet marking approach in which a path fingerprint is embedded in each packet, enabling a victim to identify packets traversing the same paths through the Internet on a per packet basis, regardless of source IP address spoofing. Pi features many unique properties. It is a per-packet deterministic mechanism: each packet traveling along the same path carries the same identifier. This allows the victim to take a proactive role in defending against a DDoS attack by using the Pi mark to filter out packets matching the attackers 2 ̆ 7 identifiers on a per packet basis. The Pi scheme performs well under large-scale DDoSattacks consisting of thousands of attackers, and is effective even when only half the routers in the Internet participate in packet marking. <b>Pi</b> <b>marking</b> and filtering are both extremely light-weight and require negligible state. We use traceroute maps of real Internet topologies (e. g. CAIDA 2 ̆ 7 s Skitter [5] and Burch and Cheswick 2 ̆ 7 s InternetMap [3, 14]) to simulate DDoS attacks and validate our design...|$|E

40|$|HIV {{protease}} is pivotal in the {{viral replication}} cycle and directs {{the formation of}} mature infectious virus particles. The development of highly specific HIV protease inhibitors (PIs), based on thorough understanding {{of the structure of}} HIV protease and its substrate, serves as a prime example of structure-based drug design. The introduction of first-generation <b>PIs</b> <b>marked</b> the start of combination antiretroviral therapy. However, low bioavailability, high pill burden, and toxicity ultimately reduced adherence and limited long-term viral inhibition. Therapy failure was often associated with multiple protease inhibitor resistance mutations, both in the viral protease and its substrate (HIV gag protein), displaying a broad spectrum of resistance mechanisms. Unfortunately, selection of protease inhibitor resistance mutations often resulted in cross-resistance to other PIs. Therefore, second-generation approaches were imperative. Coadministration of a cytochrome P- 450 3 A 4 inhibitor greatly improved the plasma concentration of PIs in the patient. A second advance was the development of PIs that were efficacious against first-generation PI-resistant HIV. Both approaches increased the number of protease mutations required by the virus to develop clinically relevant resistance, thereby raising the genetic barrier towards PI resistance. These improvements greatly contributed to the success of PI-based therapy...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Under {{sedation}} {{and over}} sedation cause several problems for critical care patients. There are no truly validated instruments for monitoring {{intensive care unit}} sedation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the validity and reliability of Glasgow Coma Scale Modified by Palma and Cook in adult patients hospitalized in intensive care unit by untrained evaluators. Methods: The study is analytical. After translating the English version of (GCSC) into persian through international Quality of life assessment method, eight surveyors (principle investigator (PI), six nurses and one resident anesthesiologist), 70 patients hospitalized in Critical Care Unit were selected through purposeful sampling. PI and all investigators evaluated the patients independently and recorded a GCSC score. In addition, the <b>PI</b> <b>marked</b> a 10 cm Visual Analog Scale and recorded Richmond sedation agitation score in order to determine of validity GCSC. Evaluators had not received training about Glasgow Coma Scale Modified by Palma and Cook. Results: Interclass correlation coefficient between inter-rater in untrained group for Glasgow Coma Scale Modified by Palma and Cook showed 0. 898 and the weighted kappa score for interrater agreement was 0. 894 with, P> 0. 001.

The final version is available from Taylor & Francis via [URL] on the Working Men’s College (WMC), this study charts the chequered fortunes of a Victorian project: providing workers with a 'liberal education'. The paper analyses the project’s aim (making 'better citizens'), its disciplinary content (the humanities and/or the sciences) and its challenges (the increasing prestige of vocational studies). It argues that, in an increasingly professionalised society, a 'liberal education' for workers became contentious ground. As {{the role of the}} sciences within a 'liberal education' diminished, and the provision of practical skills took precedence in the local-authority-funded courses, Victorian workers' opportunities for education became polarised between 'useful' sciences and 'profitless' humanities. With natural scientists losing the intellectual independence of their discipline to technicians, the WMC Edwardian educators chose to side unequivocally with the humanities. The paper contends that it was in the Edwardian context of the adult education movement that the 'two cultures' debate first emerged in Britain.

40|$|Active queue control aims {{to improve}} the overall {{communication}} network throughput while providing lower delay and small packet loss rate. The basic idea is to actively trigger packet dropping (or marking provided by explicit congestion notification (ECN)) before buffer overflow. In this paper, two artificial neural networks (ANN) -based control schemes are proposed for adaptive queue control in TCP communication networks. The structure of these controllers is optimized using genetic algorithm (GA) and the output weights of ANNs are optimized using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The controllers are radial bias function (RBF) -based, but {{to improve the}} robustness of RBF controller, an error-integral term is added to RBF equation in the second scheme.

Ca 2 + depletion, achieved by isolating renal tubules in Ca 2 +-free buffers, led to suppression of 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Re-introduction of Ca 2 + during incubation caused an acute stimulation of this enzyme. This stimulatory effect of Ca 2 + was prevented by prior treatment of Ca 2 +-depleted renal tubules for 6 h with 1, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol. Ca 2 + and <b>Pi</b> produced <b>marked</b> acute affects on 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity, which persisted for the whole 8 h experimental period, in Ca 2 +-depleted renal tubules from vitamin D-deficient chicks.

Mapping populations of tetraploid (D 6647 /PI 134942) and hexaploid (Len/ 97211) wheat were developed for characterization of the resistance gene(s). Over 100 F 2 : 3 families of each population were screened for Hessian fly-resistance using the Hessian fly genotype virH 13. Seventy-eight simple sequence repeats (SSRs) located on chromosomes 2 B and 3 A were screened on the respective populations to identify markers that were polymorphic and codominant. Using five markers, hexaploid F 2 plants were genotyped and the data combined with F 2 : 3 phenotypic information to develop linkage maps, using JoinMap® 4.

40|$|Traditional enzyme {{kinetics}} provide a poor {{explanation for the}} increased risk of lung injury in α 1 -antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. Millimolar concentrations of leukocyte elastase, when released from single azurophil granules of activated neutrophils, lead to evanescent quantum bursts of proteolytic activity before catalysis is quenched by pericellular inhibitors. Herein, we tested the possibility that quantum proteolytic events are abnormal in AAT deficiency. We incubated neutrophils on opsonized fluoresceinated fibronectin in serum from individuals with various AAT phenotypes, and then measured and modeled quantum proteolytic events. The mean areas of the events in serum from heterozygous individuals (Pi MZ and Pi SZ) were slightly, but significantly, larger than those in serum from normal patients (<b>Pi</b> M). In <b>marked</b> contrast, mean areas of events in serum from AAT-deficient individuals were 10 -fold larger than those in serum from normal patients. Diffusion modeling predicted that local elastase concentrations exceed AAT concentrations for less than 20 milliseconds and for more than 80 milliseconds in Pi M and Pi Z individuals, respectively. Thus, quantum proteolytic events are abnormally large and prolonged in AAT deficiency, leading directly to {{an increased risk of}} tissue injury in the immediate vicinity of activated neutrophils. These results have potentially important implications for the pathogenesis and prevention of lung disease in AAT deficiency...|$|R

This effect was accompanied by morphological changes from the transformed to the normal phenotype. The filamentous staining pattern of actin fibers was observed in the cells treated with these antibiotics at 33 degrees C. Removal of the antibiotics allowed the cells to revert to the transformed morphology. Ansamitocin, another benzenoid ansamycin, and naphthalenoid ansamycins such as streptovaricin and rifamycins did not show this effect.

In the present study we investigated the influence of this miRNA in osteoclastogenesis in order to elucidate its role in the course of CKD-MBD. RT-qPCR demonstrated that high Pi concentration decreased miR- 223 expression in differentiated RAW 264. 7 cells. Up- and down-regulation of miR- 223 was performed using specific pre-miR and anti-miR- 223. Differentiation of monocyte/macrophage precursors was assessed by using RAW 264. 7 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). TRAP activity and bone resorption were used to measure osteoclast activity. <b>Pi</b> induced a <b>marked</b> decrease in osteoclastogenesis in RAW cells and miR- 223 levels were concomitantly decreased. Anti-miR- 223 treatment inhibited osteoclastogenesis in the same way as Pi. In contrast, overexpression of miR- 223 triggered differentiation, as reflected by TRAP activity. We showed that miR- 223 affected the expression of its target genes NFIA and RhoB, but also osteoclast marker genes and the Akt signalling pathway, which induces osteoclastogenesis. These results were confirmed by measuring bone resorption activity of human PBMC differentiated into osteoclasts. We thus demonstrate a role of miR- 223 in osteoclast differentiation, with rational grounds to use deregulation of this miRNA to selectively increase osteoclast-like activity in calcified vessels of CKD-MBD. This approach could alleviate vascular calcification without altering bone structure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the significance and potential value of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in salivary gland tumors. We found that expression of HSP 60, HSP 70, HSP 86 and HSP 84 were all upregulated in both salivary gland benign tumors and malignant tumors, and that the expression of HSP 70, HSP 86 and HSP 84 was more greatly overexpressed in the malignant tumors (each P< 0. 01). For HSP 27, expression was upregulated both in malignant and benign tumors, with less expression observed in malignant tumors (P< 0. 01). In malignant tumors, expression of HSP 27 was negatively correlated with the age of the patients, size of the tumor tissue, occurrence of neural invasion and metastasis (each P< 0. 05). Additionally, in malignant tumors, HSP 70 and HSP 86 were both positively correlated with occurrence site, neural invasion and metastasis (each P< 0. 05), while HSP 60 was only negatively correlated with the age of the patients (P< 0. 05). HSP 86 was also positively correlated with malignant degree (P< 0. 01). In malignant tumors, the proliferation index (<b>PI),</b> which was <b>marked</b> by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; PCNA-PI) was 49. 95 ± 14. 569, which was significantly higher compared with that in benign tumors (P< 0. 001), which was in accordance with the upregulation of HSP 70, HSP 86 or HSP 84; however, an adverse correlation was found between HSP 27 expression and PCNA (each P< 0. 05). In conclusion, these results suggest that HSPs are involved in the occurrence and development of salivary gland tumors. HSP 70, HSP 86 and HSP 84 retained the higher multiplication capability of the malignant tumor cells, however, HSP 27 did not. Thus, the upregulation of HSP 70, HSP 86 and HSP 84 and the downregulation of HSP 27 may all be used as biomarkers of the occurrence and development of malignant salivary gland tumors. Moreover, the extremely high expression of HSP 86 and HSP 84 in benign tumors indicates the malignant transfor-mation potential...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Significant post {{planting}} {{mortality of}} young conifer seedlings often occurs on drought prone sites because seedlings fail to either establish, or maintain favourable water relations. Survival is contingent upon growth which occurs when turgor pressure is above a threshold level. Since growth after planting {{is influenced by}} nursery cultural practices, {{it was hypothesized that}} survival may be enhanced by the effect of irrigation and nutrient conditioning on seedling water relations. Principal water relation parameters estimated by traditional and pressure-volume methods were evaluated in conditioned Douglas-fir and jack pine container seedlings during imposed drought stress in a growth room and outside in raised cold frames containing two soil types. Seedling morphology and ion concentrations in the roots were also determined. Initially, declines in plant water potential (psi) were paralleled by decreases in osmotic potential (psi pi), but as stress increased, differential declines resulted in turgor pressure (psi rho) being variously maintained depending upon irrigation and level of applied KCl. Estimates of tissue elasticity during drought stress suggested that turgor maintenance was the result of solute concentration through tissue dehydration, not osmotic adjustment. During a second drought stress, declines in (psi) and (psi <b>pi)</b> lead to <b>marked</b> increases in in some treatments. In jack pine, this continued {{to be the result of}} dehydration and concentration of solutes, but in Douglas-fir, osmotic adjustment was a factor in turgor maintenance. Variable water relations in either species could not he attributed to the accumulation of any particular ion. Only root area exhibited an increase during drought stress. Mortality during recovery was significantly higher in daily than weekly irrigated seedlings and was not influenced by the level of applied KCl. Post drought evaluation of growth potential of surviving seedlings revealed that neither conditioning treatment nor successive drought stress precluded growth. Under field conditions the progressions of water relation parameters were similar to those recorded in growth room conditions, but the rapidity of the responses were affected by soil type. Results suggested the occurrence of osmotic adjustment in Douglas-fir; restrained decline in turgor pressure in jack pine was clearly the result of concentration of salutes through dehydration. Mortality was confined entirely to Douglas-fir in the clay loam soil, but in the sandy soil both species, regardless of conditioning treatment, experienced mortality at low soil water availability...|$|R
