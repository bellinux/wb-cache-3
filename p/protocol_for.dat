5|$|Milnrow is {{situated}} at Junction 21 of the trans-Pennine M62 motorway. Construction of the Milnrow {{part of the}} M62 began in April 1967, a process which spread mud and dirt throughout the town. The official opening of the motorway on 13 October 1971 was by Queen Elizabeth II, who was welcomed by Ralph Assheton, 1st Baron Clitheroe {{in his role as}} Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire, as well as the Chairman of Milnrow Urban District Council and his wife. Once opened, the Queen cast aside <b>protocol</b> <b>for</b> an informal meeting with the people of Milnrow.|$|E
5|$|The Johns Hopkins Hospital <b>protocol</b> <b>for</b> {{initiating}} the ketogenic diet {{has been widely}} adopted.

5|$|The first air-raid drills for the Berlin central {{government}} district, {{which included the}} Reich Chancellery, occurred {{in the autumn of}} 1937. The <b>protocol</b> <b>for</b> the drills stated, in part:To carry out the air raid drills, a precise regulation is required for the three office buildings, Wilhelmstraße 77, Wilhelmstraße 78 and Voßstraße 1... The officials and residents of Wilhelmstraße 78 and Voßstraße 1 can go to the substitute shelters in Wilhelmstraße 78 and Voßstraße 1. The inhabitants of the Reich Chancellor House, Wilhelmstraße 77, will use the shelter under the ballroom.|$|E

5|$|The {{ground station}} is {{connected}} to KSAT's Tromsø Network Operation Center, which is also connected to the TSS and SvalSat. This allows for redundancy as also TSS and TrollSat {{can be used to}} communicate with the satellites. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution. The facility uses interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common <b>protocol</b> <b>for</b> communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E
5|$|All ground {{stations}} {{are connected to}} KSAT's Tromsø Network Operation Center, which is also connected to the TSS and TrollSat. This allows for redundancy as also TSS and TrollSat {{can be used to}} communicate with the satellites. Some customers have direct access to their installations in Longyearbyen without having to route via the Tromsø Network Operation Center. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution.

5|$|CDTM is an {{expansion}} of the traditional pharmacist scope of practice, allowing for pharmacist-lead management of drug related problems (DRPs) with an emphasis on a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to pharmacy practice in the healthcare setting. The terms of a CPA are decided by the collaborating pharmacist and physician, though templates exist online. CPAs can be specific to a patient population of interest to the two parties, a specific clinical situation or disease state, and/or may outline an evidence-based <b>protocol</b> <b>for</b> managing the drug regimen of patients under the CPA. CPAs have become the subject of intense debate within the pharmacy and medical professions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} building and deploying <b>protocols</b> <b>for</b> migrating mobile agents over the Internet. The framework enables network <b>protocols</b> <b>for</b> agent migration to be naturally implemented within mobile agents and then dynamically deployed at remote hosts by migrating the agents that perform the protocols. It is built on a hierarchical mobile agent system, called MobileSpaces, and several <b>protocols</b> <b>for</b> migrating agents for managing cluster computing systems have been designed and implemented based on the framework...|$|R

5|$|The site is {{only able}} to {{communicate}} with LEO satellites in ten of their fourteen orbits, unlike SvalSat and TrollSat which can communicate in all orbits. All three stations are interconnected and communicate with the Tromsø Network Operations Center, {{which is part of the}} TSS complex. This allows for redundancy as TSS, SvalSat and TrollSat can be used to communicate with all satellites connected to the system. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution, in addition to network planning, customer support and ground station control. The facilities use interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common <b>protocol</b> <b>for</b> communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E
5|$|There {{is as yet}} no universally {{accepted}} diagnostic <b>protocol</b> <b>for</b> reactive attachment disorder. Often a range of measures is used in research and diagnosis. Recognized assessment methods of attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the Strange Situation Procedure (devised by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth), the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment, the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment, the Attachment Q-sort {{and a variety of}} narrative techniques using stem stories, puppets or pictures. For older children, actual interviews such as the Child Attachment Interview and the Autobiographical Emotional Events Dialogue can be used. Caregivers may also be assessed using procedures such as the Working Model of the Child Interview.|$|E
5|$|To {{minimize}} Soviet opposition, Norway {{attempted to}} move the debate from the political to the specialist scene, {{while at the same}} time establishing a <b>protocol</b> <b>for</b> Norwegian control and operation of the facility. To achieve this, Norwegian authorities worked towards establishing an inspection procedure to insure that the facilities remained solely used for 'peaceful activities'. This would particularly focus on the regular inspection of auxiliary equipment. To depoliticize the issue further, the government appointed the semi-independent NTNF as the operator of the facility. The first oral consultations between the Soviet embassy and the Norwegian government took place in November 1964.|$|E

On Brown's instructions, Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell had updated the <b>protocol</b> <b>for</b> dealing with a hung parliament earlier in the year. Following confirmation that no party had achieved an overall majority, Brown authorised O'Donnell to begin the process.
