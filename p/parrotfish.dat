5|$|In the Caribbean and {{tropical}} Pacific, direct contact between ~40–70% of common seaweeds and coral causes bleaching and {{death to the}} coral via transfer of lipid-soluble metabolites. Seaweed and algae proliferate given adequate nutrients and limited grazing by herbivores such as <b>parrotfish.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over 90% of the sicklefin lemon shark's diet {{consists}} of bottom- and shore-dwelling teleosts, including herring, mullets, mackerel, silversides, needlefish, smelt-whitings, porgies, sea catfish, triggerfish, <b>parrotfish,</b> and porcupinefish. Occasionally, {{they may also}} take cephalopods and crustaceans, and older individuals {{have been known to}} consume stingrays and guitarfish. This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites include the tapeworms Paraorygmatobothrium arnoldi, Pseudogrillotia spratti, Phoreiobothrium perilocrocodilus, and Platybothrium jondoeorum. Sicklefin lemon sharks have been documented resting on the bottom and eliciting cleanings by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus), during which they may open their mouths and stop respiring for as long as 150 seconds to give the wrasses access to their mouths and gills.|$|E
5|$|Some teleost {{species are}} hermaphroditic, which {{can come in}} two forms: {{simultaneous}} and sequential. In the former, both spermatozoa and eggs {{are present in the}} gonads. Simultaneous hermaphroditism typically occurs in species that live in the ocean depths, where potential mates are sparsely dispersed. Self-fertilisation is rare and has only been recorded in two species, Kryptolebias marmoratus and Kryptolebias hermaphroditus. With sequential hermaphroditism, individuals may function as one sex early in their adult life and switch later in life. Species with this condition include <b>parrotfish,</b> wrasses, sea basses, flatheads, sea breams and lightfishes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Parrotfishes</b> (f. Labridae) are {{a unique}} and {{ubiquitous}} group of herbivorous reef fishes. We compared the distribution and ecosystem function (grazing and erosion) of <b>parrotfishes</b> across 75 reefs in Arabia. Our results revealed marked regional differences in the abundance, and taxonomic and functional composition of <b>parrotfishes</b> between the Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and Arabian Gulf. High densities and diversity of <b>parrotfishes,</b> and high rates of grazing (210 % year(⁻¹)) and erosion (1. 57 kg m(⁻²) year(⁻¹)) characterised Red Sea reefs. Despite Arabian Sea and Red Sea reefs having broadly comparable abundances of <b>parrotfishes,</b> estimates of grazing (150 % year(⁻¹)) and erosion (0. 43 kg m(⁻²) year(⁻¹)) were markedly lower in the Arabian Sea. <b>Parrotfishes</b> were extremely rare within the southern Arabian Gulf, and as such rates of grazing and erosion were negligible. This regional variation in abundance and functional composition of <b>parrotfishes</b> appears {{to be related to}} local environmental conditions...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, the <b>parrotfishes</b> {{have been}} {{considered}} to be a family level taxon, Scaridae. Although phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of <b>parrotfishes</b> is ongoing, they are now accepted to be a clade in the tribe Cheilini, and are now commonly referred to as scarine labrids (subfamily Scarinae, family Labridae). Some authorities have preferred to maintain the <b>parrotfishes</b> as a family-level taxon, resulting in Labridae not being monophyletic (unless split into several families).|$|R
40|$|Since {{the mass}} {{mortality}} of the urchin Diadema antillarum in 1983, <b>parrotfishes</b> {{have become the}} dominant grazer on Caribbean reefs. The grazing capacity of these fishes could be impaired if marine reserves achieve their long-term goal of restoring large consumers, several of which prey on <b>parrotfishes.</b> Here we compare the negative impacts of enhanced predation with the positive impacts of reduced fishing mortality on <b>parrotfishes</b> inside reserves. Because large-bodied <b>parrotfishes</b> escape the risk of predation from a large piscivore (the Nassau grouper), the predation effect reduced grazing by only 4 to 8 %. This impact was overwhelmed by the increase in density of large <b>parrotfishes,</b> resulting in a net doubling of grazing. Increased grazing caused a fourfold reduction in the cover of macroalgae, which, {{because they are the}} principal competitors of corals, highlights the potential importance of reserves for coral reef resilience...|$|R
5|$|Three {{types of}} habitats, mangroves, reefs and seagrasses, {{are found in}} Puerto Rico's ocean waters. A total of 677 fish species live in these habitats; 242 being reef species. Fish species found in Puerto Rican reefs are {{representative}} of the general Caribbean fauna. Common reef fishes include wrasses, damselfishes, white grunts (Haemulon plumieri), bluestriped grunts (Haemulon sciurus), queen <b>parrotfish</b> (Scarus vetula), and sharks (family Carcharhinidae). Sea breams (Archosargus rhomboidalis) and yellowfin mojarras (Gerres cinereus) are some of the species commonly found in mangrove habitats. Other species of interest include flatfishes, with 21 recorded species, and sharks, with more than 20 species. Oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks are common in the Mona Passage.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads have {{numerous}} predators, especially {{early in}} their lives. Egg and nestling predators include ghost crabs, oligochaete worms, beetles, fly larvae, ants, parasitoid wasp larvae, flesh flies, snakes, gulls, corvids, opossums, bears, rats, armadillos, mustelids, skunks, canids, procyonids, cats, pigs, and humans. During their migration from their nests to the sea, hatchlings are preyed on by dipteran larvae, crabs, toads, lizards, snakes, seabirds such as frigatebirds, and other assorted birds and mammals. In the ocean, predators of the loggerhead juveniles include fish, such as <b>parrotfish</b> and moray eels, and portunid crabs. Adults are more rarely attacked due to their large size, but may be preyed on by large sharks, seals, and killer whales. Nesting females are attacked by flesh flies, feral dogs, and humans. Salt marsh mosquitos can also pester nesting females.|$|E
25|$|The same hideouts in a reef may be {{regularly}} {{inhabited by}} different species {{at different times}} of day. Nighttime predators such as cardinalfish and squirrelfish hide during the day, while damselfish, surgeonfish, triggerfish, wrasses and <b>parrotfish</b> hide from eels and sharks.|$|E
40|$|<b>Parrotfishes</b> are an ecologically and commercially {{important}} teleost {{group whose}} grazing contributes to maintaining coral-dominated states on hermatypic reefs. However, overfishing has skewed sex ratios of Atlantic <b>parrotfishes</b> because fishing has disproportionate impacts on larger individuals, and males are generally larger than females. Whether protection from fishing may allow sex ratios {{to return to}} equilibrium is unknown, as fishing can induce irreversible ecological and/or evolutionary shifts. Bermuda banned trap fishing in 1990, creating {{a unique opportunity to}} analyse long-term responses of Atlantic <b>parrotfishes</b> to release from fishing. We found that sex ratios of four common <b>parrotfishes</b> were initially skewed, with male proportions ranging from 0. 04 to 0. 18. However, male proportions rebounded within 3 – 4 yr, equilibrating at values ranging from 0. 36 to 0. 54, similar to those reported at unfished sites in the region. Our results are encouraging for regional efforts to recover lost grazing function by restoring overfished herbivore populations...|$|R
50|$|Sparisoma is a genus of <b>parrotfishes</b> {{native to}} warmer {{parts of the}} Atlantic. FishBase recognizes 15 species in this genus, {{including}} S. rocha described from Trindade Island in 2010 and S. choati described from the East Atlantic in 2012. They are the main grazers of algae in the Caribbean since sea urchins, the former main grazers, experienced a mass extinction and were supplanted by the <b>parrotfishes.</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Parrotfish</b> {{are named}} for their parrot-like beaks and bright colours. They are large herbivores that graze on the algae that grows on hard dead corals.

40|$|The recent loss of key {{consumers}} to exploitation and habitat degradation has significantly altered community dynamics and ecosystem function across many ecosystems worldwide. Predicting {{the impacts of}} consumer losses requires knowing the level of functional diversity that exists within a consumer assemblage. In this study, we document functional diversity among nine species of <b>parrotfishes</b> on Caribbean coral reefs. <b>Parrotfishes</b> are key herbivores that facilitate the maintenance and recovery of coral-dominated reefs by controlling algae and provisioning space for the recruitment of corals. We observed large functional differences among two genera of <b>parrotfishes</b> that were driven by differences in diet. Fishes in the genus Scarus targeted filamentous algal turf assemblages, crustose coralline algae, and endolithic algae and avoided macroalgae, while fishes in the genus Sparisoma preferentially targeted macroalgae. However, species with similar diets were dissimilar in other attributes, including the habitats they frequented, the types of substrate they fed from, and the spatial scale at which they foraged. These differences indicate that species {{that appear to be}} functionally redundant when looking at diet alone exhibit high levels of complementarity when we consider multiple functional traits. By identifying key functional differences among <b>parrotfishes,</b> we provide critical information needed to manage <b>parrotfishes</b> to enhance the resilience of coral-dominated reefs and reverse phase shifts on algal-dominated reefs throughout the wider Caribbean. Further, our study provides a framework for predicting the impacts of consumer losses in other species rich ecosystems...|$|R

25|$|Smaller <b>parrotfish</b> are {{relatively}} defenceless herbivores, poorly defended against predators like barracuda. They {{have evolved to}} find protection by schooling, sometimes with other species like shoaling rabbitfish. Spinefoot rabbitfish are named for their defensive venomous spines, and they are seldom attacked by predators. Spines are a last-ditch defence. It is better to avoid predator detection in the first place, and avoid being thrust into risky spine-to-fang battles. So rabbitfish have also evolved skilful colour changing abilities.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{and seafood}} {{play a major}} role in Kerala cuisine, as Kerala is a coastal state. An {{everyday}} Kerala meal in most households consists of rice with fish curry made of sardines, mackerel, seer fish, king fish, pomfret, prawns, shrimp, sole, anchovy, <b>parrotfish,</b> etc. (mussels, oysters, crabs, squid, scallops etc. are not rare), vegetable curry and stir-fried vegetables with or without coconut traditionally known as thoran or mizhukkupiratti. As Kerala has large inland water bodies, freshwater fish are abundant, and constitute regular meals.|$|E
25|$|Marine biota in {{the region}} have representatives of both the Indian and Pacific oceans which were caught in the Caribbean before the {{emergence}} of the Isthmus of Panama four million years ago.

Throughout the Caribbean there is industrial catching of lobster and sardines (off the coast of Yucatán Peninsula).|$|E
40|$|<b>Parrotfishes</b> and {{surgeonfishes}} perform important functional {{roles in}} the dynamics of coral reef systems. This {{is a consequence of}} their varied feeding behaviors ranging from targeted consumption of living plant material (primarily surgeonfishes) to feeding on detrital aggregates that are either scraped from the reef surface or excavated from the deeper reef substratum (primarily <b>parrotfishes).</b> Increased fishing pressure and widespread habitat destruction have led to population declines for several species of these two groups. Species-specific data on global distribution, population status, life history characteristics, and major threats were compiled for each of the 179 known species of <b>parrotfishes</b> and surgeonfishes to determine the likelihood of extinction of each species under the Categories and Criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

25|$|The Formigas Bank is {{essentially}} a submarine volcano, inhabited by deep-dwelling marine species, coral and sponges. The cone is delimited approximately by the islets of the northwest and the Dollabarats reef to the southeast. In the ancient crater there is a rich community of species common to the Azores. Among the species typical of the area are wrasse (Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, ornate wrasse), damselfish, sergeant fish (yellow and black), grouper, Mediterranean <b>parrotfish,</b> and the emblematic Atlantic goliath grouper, Serranidae and barred hogfish. Alongside these are pelagic predators that also reside in the bank (African threadfish, longbill spearfish) and migratory species that travel between destinations (like the manta ray and whale shark).|$|E
25|$|Reefs grow as polyps {{and other}} organisms deposit calcium carbonate, {{the basis of}} coral, as a {{skeletal}} structure beneath and around themselves, pushing the coral head's top upwards and outwards. Waves, grazing fish (such as <b>parrotfish),</b> sea urchins, sponges, and other forces and organisms act as bioeroders, breaking down coral skeletons into fragments that settle into spaces in the reef structure or form sandy bottoms in associated reef lagoons. Many other organisms living in the reef community contribute skeletal calcium carbonate in the same manner. Coralline algae are important contributors to reef structure in {{those parts of the}} reef subjected to the greatest forces by waves (such as the reef front facing the open ocean). These algae strengthen the reef structure by depositing limestone in sheets over the reef surface.|$|E
25|$|Pelagic spawners: {{a type of}} {{broadcast}} spawners, spawn in the open sea, mostly near the surface. They are usually pelagic fish such as tuna and sardines. Some demersal fish leave the bottom to spawn pelagically, particularly coral reef fish such as <b>parrotfish</b> and wrasses. Pelagic spawning means water currents widely disperse the young. The eggs, embryos and larvae of pelagic spawners contain oil globules or have a high water content. As a result, they are buoyant and are widely dispersed by currents. The downside is that mortality is high, {{because they can be}} eaten so easily by pelagic predators or they can drift into unsuitable areas. Females compensate by spawning large numbers of eggs and extending their spawning periods. Pelagic spawners that live in or around coral reefs can spawn a small number of eggs almost daily over a period of months. These fishes have complex breeding behaviours including sex changes, harems, leks and territoriality. See also: Coral reef fish.|$|E

25|$|Fishing {{scenes are}} rarely {{represented}} in ancient Greek culture, {{a reflection of}} the low social status of fishing. However, Oppian of Corycus, a Greek author wrote a major treatise on sea fishing, the Halieulica or Halieutika, composed between 177 and 180. This is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day. The consumption of fish varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household. In the Greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood (squid, octopus, and shellfish) were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland. Sardines and anchovies were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A stele of the late 3rd century BCE from the small Boeotian city of Akraiphia, on Lake Copais, provides us with a list of fish prices. The cheapest was skaren (probably <b>parrotfish)</b> whereas Atlantic bluefin tuna was three times as expensive. Common salt water fish were yellowfin tuna, red mullet, ray, swordfish or sturgeon, a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its eels, celebrated by the hero of The Acharnians. Other fresh water fish were pike-fish, carp and the less appreciated catfish.|$|E
500|$|In {{assessing}} the geology of the reef, Darwin showed his remarkable ability to collect facts and find patterns to reconstruct geological history {{on the basis}} of the very limited evidence available. He gave attention to the smallest detail. Having heard that <b>parrotfish</b> browsed on the living coral, he dissected specimens to find finely ground coral in their intestines. He concluded that such fish, and coral eating invertebrates such as Holothuroidea, could account for the banks of fine grained mud he found at the Keeling Islands; it showed also [...] "that there are living checks to the growth of coral-reefs, and that the almost universal law of 'consume and be consumed,' holds good even with the polypifers forming those massive bulwarks, which are able to withstand the force of the open ocean." ...|$|E
500|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{exists in}} some species. Individuals of one sex, usually males develop {{secondary sexual characteristics}} that increase their chances of reproductive success. In dolphinfish, males have larger and blunter heads than females. In several minnow species, males develop swollen heads and small bumps known as breeding tubercles during the breeding season. The male green humphead <b>parrotfish</b> has a more well-developed forehead with an [...] "ossified ridge" [...] which {{plays a role in}} ritualised headbutting. Dimorphism can also take the form of differences in coloration. Again, it is usually the males that are brightly coloured; in killifishes, rainbowfishes and wrasses the colours are permanent while in species like minnows, sticklebacks, darters and sunfishes, the colour changes with seasons. Such coloration can be very conspicuous to predators, showing that the drive to reproduce can be stronger than that to avoid predation.|$|E
40|$|This project {{assessed}} {{the significance of}} Pigeon Creek, San Salvador, Bahamas as a nursery habitat for coral reef fishes. Pigeon Creek’s perimeter is lined with mangrove and limestone bedrock. The bottom is sand or seagrass and ranges in depth from exposed at low tide to a 3 -m deep, tide-scoured channel. In June 2006 and January 2007, fish were counted and their maturity was recorded while sampling 112 of 309 possible 50 -m transects along {{the perimeter of the}} Pigeon Creek. Excluding silversides (Atherinidae, 52 % of fish counted), six families each comprised > 1 % of the total abundance (Scaridae/parrotfishes, 35. 3 %; Lutjanidae/snappers, 23. 9 %; Haemulidae/grunts, 21. 0 %; Gerreidae/mojarras, 8. 5 %; Pomacentridae/damselfishes, 6. 1 %; Labridae/wrasses, 2. 4 %). There were few differences in effort-adjusted counts among habitats (mangrove, bedrock, mixed), sections (north, middle, southwest) and seasons (summer 2006 and winter 2007). Red Mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), covering 68 % of the perimeter was where 62 % of the fish were counted. Snappers, grunts and <b>parrotfishes</b> are important food fishes and significant families in terms of reef ecology around San Salvador. Mangrove was the most important habitat for snappers and grunts; bedrock was most important for <b>parrotfishes.</b> The southwest section was important for snappers, grunts and <b>parrotfishes,</b> the north section for grunts and <b>parrotfishes,</b> and the middle section for snappers.

40|$|The {{concept of}} home ranges is {{fundamental}} to ecology. Numerous studies have quantified how home ranges scale with body size across taxa. However, these relationships are not always applicable intraspecifically. Here, we describe how the home range of an important group of reef fish, the <b>parrotfishes,</b> scales with body mass. With masses spanning five orders of magnitude, from the early postsettlement stage through to adulthood, we find {{no evidence of a}} response to predation risk, dietary shifts or sex change on home range expansion rates. Instead, we document a distinct ontogenetic shift in home range expansion with sexual maturity. Juvenile <b>parrotfishes</b> displayed rapid home range growth until reaching approximately 100 – 150 mm length. Thereafter, the relationship between home range and mass broke down. This shift reflected changes in colour patterns, social status and reproductive behaviour associated with the transition to adult stages.
