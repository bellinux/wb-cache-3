40|$|The oath is what holds {{democracy}} together,” {{claimed the}} Athenian orator Lycurgus, whose democracy was composed exclusively of men. 1 Athens was the definitive phallogocentric community where public discursive {{practices such as}} the oath were the prerogative of male citizens who competed for power in the agora, the assembly, and the lawcourts. Euripides, however, represents the disquieting occurrence of women tendering oaths for men, a phenomenon that challenges the gendered hierarchy of his society. 2 In this article I explore how three Euripidean dramas, Medea, Hippolytus, and Ipigenia in Tauris, allow women to use these potent speech acts to control men’s language and action. 3 By tendering <b>promissory</b> <b>oath</b> Euripides’ female characters cite a conventional social practice that is intrinsically performative; oath taking scenes are reflective boath of the world external to the drama and of the dramatic performance itself. Furthermore when men swear {{to do something for}} a woman—grant sanctuary, keep a secret, carry a letter—they also enter into a contract with the gods who function as the guarantors of the oath. This triangulated relationship—man, woman, god—contributes to the increased agency of female protagonists, whose authority is fortified by invoking the gods as witnesses to the oaths. Oaths “were divinely ordained and magically protected,” as Anne Burnett puts it, and they “stood like the primeval pillar that supports the sky. ” Consonant with the ancient world’s respect for their cultural authority, Euripidean oaths become a powerful dramaturgical device by which the divine world aids women’s machinations, now an inexorable force that propels the tragedy to its reversal...|$|E

Catholics were allowed to worship under strict conditions through the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791. As time went on, oaths and tests that barred non-conformists and Catholics from public offices, school keeping and owning land were rescinded by laws such as Roman Catholic Relief Act, 1778, the Roman Catholic Charities Act 1832, the Test Abolition Act 1867, the <b>Promissory</b> <b>Oaths</b> Act 1868, the <b>Promissory</b> <b>Oaths</b> Act 1871 and the Oaths Act 1978. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 allowed Catholics to be elected to Parliament and most Crown offices, while the Jews Relief Act 1858 acted similarly for members of Judaism. The Religious Disabilities Act 1846 ended restrictions on Catholics for education, charities, and property - though Oxford, Cambridge and Durham universities were allowed to ban Catholics until the passage of the University Tests Act 1871.

The first was laid down by the Canons of 1603/4 and modified by the Clerical Subscription Act 1865 which also prescribed the form of the declaration against simony; the words of the oath of allegiance accorded to the form in the <b>Promissory</b> <b>Oaths</b> Act 1868.
