40|$|According {{to current}} standards, {{the use of}} {{unreinforced}} masonry is only recommended in regions of low to moderate seismicity as a resisting system to carry earthquake-induced horizontal forces. This requirement is however felt as rather conservative and leading to uneconomical constructive solutions, in particular for low seismic regions. Moreover, the seismic analysis of masonry structures has to be performed along two main perpendicular directions, usually neglecting the contribution of wall elements perpendicular to the seismic action. Horizontal elements (spandrel, etc.) are also commonly disregarded. In such a context, the present contribution {{provides an overview of}} experimental results obtained from shake table tests on unreinforced masonry frames carried out in the EQUALS Laboratory of Bristol University in order to assess, and possibly enhance, current design rules. The study is focused on the contribution of walls perpendicular to the seismic action and on the influence of the frame effect induced by the coupling of the walls through horizontal reinforced concrete elements, such as lintels and floor slabs. Another point of interest of the study is the influence of the gravity loading situation, comparing a <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> <b>supported</b> by the shear walls {{as well as by the}} perpendicular elements, with a <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> <b>supported</b> by the perpendicular walls only.

5000|$|Further {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} the building was built with incorrect application of a technique called [...] "flat slab construction". Reinforced concrete buildings are often built by using columns and beams, with the <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> <b>supported</b> over {{the full length of}} the beams. [...] "Flat slab construction" [...] does not use beams but <b>supports</b> the <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> directly on the columns. The area of floor around the columns must be reinforced in order to carry the load; even then, if the columns are too narrow, they can punch through the slab. However, examination of the building showed the concrete columns installed were only 60 cm in diameter, below the required 80 cm shown in the plans. Worse still, the number of steel reinforcing bars embedded into the concrete was 8, not the required 16, which gave the building only half its needed strength. Steel reinforcements intended to strengthen the concrete floor were placed 10 cm from the top instead of 5 cm, decreasing the structure's strength by about another 20%.|$|R

40|$|Pile <b>supported</b> <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> {{have often}} been {{designed}} solely in ultimate limit state ULS and then foremost with uniformly distributed loadings UDL. The investigation of serviceability limit state SLS has been of simpler nature, even according to the governing codes of practice. Often it has been minimum‑reinforced with the presumption that full friction to the supporting ground is present, whit‑out any inspection, which by the Swedish code of practice even more reduced the addition of crack reinforcement. The cracks have not been controlled, before they in fact have occurred. For pile <b>supported</b> <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> the ground <b>support</b> will be there still, {{at least for a}} time, after the casting. As the ground settles, as dehydration always will occur, and drainage and the covering roof the precipitation to reach the ground, the slab will often be completely free bearing between the piles. The minimum reinforcement {{is based on the assumption}} that only the upper layer is needed to reinforce due to dehydration shrinkage – despite that the whole floor section in time will obtain the same moisture profile and also shrinkage magnitude. One often excludes the influence of creep and temperature and the affect from external loading and local variance of restraints in calculations in the SLS. Research on behaviour in SLS has been modest; in spite of that the contractors and the client and finally the end‑user of the floors often suffer from these problems. It has by this thesis been established that the shrinkage of the concrete used for industrial floors is large 0. 9 ‑ 1. 1 ‰, and that the problem foremost arise from cracking and problems with joints and unevenness in the floor. The integrated method for design and production of industrial floors is a way to the solution, but requires that all involved assign to co‑operate to 100 %. Furthermore it is required that one selects the proper materials to the proper design and the proper production method. If one will save cost this will often be on materials; which will lead to reduced reinforcement content and reduced concrete thickness. This way is wrong and will in end make the client suffer economically. A way to solve this has been to cast the floors with steel fibre concrete SFC; from the beginning often a little bit thicker and with moderate steel fibre content and complementary reinforcement, compared to present execution. The competition from abroad has nevertheless shaped solutions that with thinner slabs and less traditional reinforcement and invalid design calculations compete on faulty grounds. This work demonstrates how this make the floor suffer in ULS and SLS. Trough full‑scale testing (half of a normally loaded industrial floor in matter of geometry) where a pile <b>supported</b> <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> has been simulated by a flat‑slab floor cast in steel fibre concrete, it has been shown that the solution with steel fibre concrete performs well  in slabs for industrial floors. On one hand it gives the opportunity to production wise superior methods for placing concrete which potentially could gain the environment with reduced reinforcement content, and on the other hand SFC brings a ductile failure behaviour for loadings with much larger magnitudes than in normal ULS design, and further SFC provides with a stiffer response and with possibility to construct slabs with small creep deformation. Finally it has been established that, when it comes to short‑term point loadings (ULS) and with long-term point loadings (SLS) one can rely on the bearing capacity and the tough behaviour of SFC. And that one may exert an influence on both limit states, through variation of the SFC and the reinforcement content. This is shown for a real bearing structure, the pile <b>supported</b> industrial <b>floor,</b> and that in a safe way. QC 20120921 </p...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of an}} {{international}} major research initiative, dealing with the behaviour of long span cellular beams in steel framed buildings under fire, a large-scale fire test incorporating 15 m long cellular beams was carried out. The test incorporated unprotected secondary cellular steel beams acting compositely with the <b>supporting</b> <b>floor</b> <b>slab.</b> The floorplate in its entirety was designed {{to carry the load}} with unprotected beams, when subjected to a severe fire, by utilising membrane action of the floor slab.

The test supported the assumptions adopted in the structural design approach and provided an accurate estimate of the strength of the floorplate.

40|$|In {{the seismic}} design of {{reinforced}} concrete frames, plastic hinges are allocated to beams such that a ductile beam-sway mechanism will form in preference to other less ductile mechanisms {{in the event}} of a major earthquake. This is achieved by ensuring that the flexural strength of columns is greater than that corresponding to the maximum likely flexural strength of beam plastic hinges. Recent experimental studies in New Zealand have shown that elongation of ductile beam plastic hinges, and its interaction with nearby floor slab containing precast-prestressed floor units, increases the strength of beams much more than that specified in New Zealand and American Concrete standards. This level of strength enhancement has raised concern on the adequacy of the current design provisions. To further investigate this problem, a research project was initiated to examine the strength of beam plastic hinges in reinforced concrete frames containing precast-prestressed floor units. In this research, the strength of beam plastic hinges was assessed through experimental and analytical studies. A three-dimensional, one-storey, two-bay reinforced concrete moment resisting frame with <b>prestressed</b> <b>floor</b> units and cast-in-situ concrete topping was tested under quasi-static displacement-controlled cyclic loading. The experimental results provided insight into the mechanics associated with frame-floor interaction. Subsequently, improved design specifications were proposed based on the observed behaviour. To analytically predict the beam-floor interaction, a ductile reinforced concrete plastic hinge multi-spring element was developed and validated with experimental results from cantilever beam and frame sub-assembly tests reported in the literature. The comparisons have demonstrated the ability of the proposed plastic hinge element to predict the flexural, shear, axial, and most importantly, elongation response of ductile plastic hinges. The proposed plastic hinge element was implemented into an analytical model to simulate the behaviour of the frame-floor sub-assembly tested in this research. Specially arranged truss-like elements were used to model the linking slab (the region connecting the main beam to the first <b>prestressed</b> <b>floor</b> unit), where significant inelastic behaviour was expected to occur. The analytical model was found to be capable of predicting the non-linear hysteretic response and the main deformation mechanisms in the frame-floor sub-assembly test. The analytical frame-floor model developed in this study was used to examine the effect of different structural arrangements on the cyclic behaviour of frames containing <b>prestressed</b> <b>floor</b> units. These analyses indicated that slab reinforcement content, the number of bays in a frame and the position of frame in a building (i. e., perimeter or internal frame) can have a significant influence on the strength and elongation response of plastic hinges...|$|R

After an introductory Chapter on slabs, the broad design provisions of the British and American Codes of Practice are set out A historical review of elastic and ultimate load methods of slab design together with examples is then followed by a discussion on loads, load factors, material factors, patterns of loading and the division of slabs into various strips. Three extensive chapters with examples {{on the use of}} the Codes of Practice examine and discuss the provisions and behaviour of slabs on rigid and semi-rigid <b>supports</b> and flat <b>slabs</b> <b>supported</b> by columns. The results of an extensive elastic finite element investigation are compared with the various methods available for the design of the three types of slabs under both serviceability and ultimate conditions. In Chapter 5 on rigidly <b>supported</b> <b>slabs</b> it is concluded that for the British Code the ultimate load recommendations are satisfactory but that in general the moment coefficients recommended require considerable negative moment redistribution and in some cases by considering the finite element results the steel must almost be yielding under the serviceability loads. With one exception the American code is better from the serviceability condition aspect but the simply <b>supported</b> <b>slab</b> bending moment coefficients would cause premature failure. Chapter 6 on <b>slabs</b> on semi-rigidly <b>supported</b> <b>slabs</b> indicates the British code is sadly deficient on design information for this type of slab while the American code gives proposals which give answers which are broadly in agreement with the finite element analysis.

The partners worked separately and carried out a small but highly significant body of work including private houses, flats and a film studio. Early highlights include the radical fan-shaped house called New Farm for Sir Arthur Lowes Dickinson in 1932. New Farm, designed by Connell, was a more thorough synthesis of modernist planning and construction where irregularly shaped concrete <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> <b>supported</b> on thin columns radiated out from a glazed stair tower. With its large areas of glass, daring cantilevers and thin reinforced concrete walls, it was arguably the boldest modernist house to have been built outside Europe at that time. Concrete House in Bristol and Kent House, a large block of low cost flats for the St Pancras Housing Society, followed in 1934, after which Connell's output was somewhat overshadowed by Ward and Lucas who succeeded in gaining commissions for increasingly large and complex private houses. 66 Frognal, their final commission (designed by Colin Lucas) was another cause célèbre and confirmed their reputation as architectural provocateurs, a role that Connell and Ward later enjoyed but one that embarrassed the modest Lucas. The breakup of the partnership left something of a rift between the New Zealanders and Lucas. In an effort to secure work, Connell entered the competition for the Auckland Cathedral (1940) and narrowly missed selection, gaining second prize with a Swedish style neo-classical plan.
