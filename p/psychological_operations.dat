5|$|The US Department of Defense {{issued its}} Quadrennial Defense Review on 6 February 2006.

To support this, the department announced that <b>psychological</b> <b>operations</b> and civil affairs units would be increased by 3,700 soldiers to support units throughout the Army. This would include a large increase of the active component civil affairs, {{which at the time}} consisted of only the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion, commanding six company sized units assigned to the major regional commands of the US Army. The decision was made to form a brigade-sized civil affairs unit to act as a command element for the only four active duty battalion sized civil affairs units operating for the active duty US Army. This move would allow the brigade to more quickly prepare its subordinate units for rapid deployment in support of Army contingencies in order to provide tactical support to other Army units. It was decided shortly thereafter that the 95th Civil Affairs Group would be reactivated.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTerrorism is a quintessential <b>psychological</b> <b>operation</b> involving {{the use of}} violence to convey a message to multiple audiences. As a <b>psychological</b> <b>operation,</b> terrorism produces two effects; one propaganda and the other psychological warfare. The propaganda effects are informative, persuasive, or compelling among neutral, friendly or potentially friendly target audiences. The psychological warfare effects are provocative, disruptive, and coercive among enemy or hostile target audiences. By comparing the Zionist and the Palestinian terrorist campaigns, this thesis demonstrates how terrorism produces psychological warfare and propaganda effects on multiple audiences and the consequences of each. The success of the Jewish resistance resulted from a strategy of terrorism that identified the psychological vulnerabilities of certain audiences, controlled for the psychological warfare and propaganda effects on those audiences, and anticipated audience response. By comparison, the Palestinian resistance did not control for the psychological warfare and propaganda effects on multiple audiences. Palestinian terrorism was exclusively psychological warfare, which failed to propagandize the cause beyond their national constituency. In either case, {{the success or failure of}} terrorism should be understood in part by viewing their campaigns of terror through the prism of psychological operations[URL] United States Arm...|$|R

40|$|Appreciative joy, {{as one of}} {{the four}} immeasurables in Buddhism, refers to feeling happy for people, and it is {{cultivated}} by appreciative joy meditation (AJM). There is a debate regarding whether appreciative joy is conceptually the same as positive empathy (empathy for others 2 Ì† 7 positive experiences); thus, this report empirically tests the similarities and differences between appreciative joy and positive empathy. Study 1 recruited a sample of 317 general participants using an online survey and evaluated the similarities and differences between the Appreciative Joy Scale (AJS) and the Positive Empathy Scale (PES) on the outcome variables of altruism, envy, and subjective well-being. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the AJS and PES were independent of one another, and hierarchical multiple regressions indicated that AJS accounted for more variances on altruism than the PES. Study 2 recruited 119 participants in an experiment in a laboratory setting and compared the effects of AJM and the <b>psychological</b> <b>operation</b> of positive empathy in a matched setting on self-reported emotions and interpersonal attitudes. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that AJM generated significantly more other-focused positive emotions (e. g., love) in comparison with the positive empathy condition. These two studies supported that the concept and <b>psychological</b> <b>operation</b> of positive empathy differ from appreciative joy and AJM in Buddhism. In particular, the results in terms of altruism and other-focused positive emotions supported the conceptual analysis that appreciative joy directly involves kind intentions toward the target, whereas positive empathy does not necessarily do so...|$|R
