25|$|When {{the race}} began in early 2004, Daschle led by 7% in January and February. By May, his lead was just 2% and summer <b>polls</b> <b>showed</b> a varying number of trends: Daschle or Thune led by {{no more than}} 2%, but some <b>polls</b> <b>showed</b> a tie. Throughout September, Daschle led Thune by margins of 2-5% while during the entire month of October into the November 2 election, most <b>polls</b> <b>showed</b> that Thune and Daschle were dead even, usually tied 49-49 among likely voters. Some <b>polls</b> <b>showed</b> either Thune or Daschle leading by {{extremely}} slim margins.|$|R
5000|$|A {{poll that}} was {{released}} in early April 2012 by Public Policy <b>Polling</b> <b>showed</b> that those surveyed favored the measure 43% to 37%, with one-fifth of those <b>polled</b> <b>showing</b> they were undecided on the issue.|$|R
50|$|The first {{opinion poll}} {{released}} after the first-round, published by El Mercurio-Opina on December 18, had Bachelet with 42.8%, Piñera with 37.5% and 19.7% undecided. Later opinion <b>polls</b> <b>showed</b> similar results, {{except for one}} <b>poll</b> <b>showing</b> Piñera above Bachelet by 1%. The <b>polls</b> released <b>showed</b> on average that Bachelet maintained an advantage over Piñera above 5%, but {{with a large number}} of voters (18%) still undecided or that would not declare a preference. If this last percentage was removed from the vote, then Bachelet, the <b>polls</b> <b>showed,</b> would have won the presidency by a margin above 7%, which was accurate with the final results of the election.|$|R
5|$|After the {{resignation}} of South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint to run Heritage Foundation, Colbert was named a possible candidate for appointment to the seat being vacated by DeMint, which would have triggered a special election in 2014 to finish out DeMint's term. Although Governor Nikki Haley announced promptly {{that she had no}} intention to nominate Colbert to the Senate, a <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> Colbert as a favorite among South Carolina voters.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1989 Arnada {{began an}} {{internship}} with the weekly Editor. He used the {{position as a}} learning experience. Arnada served as {{an editor of the}} Jakarta-based tabloid Monitor between 1990 and 1991. The publication was shut down after it published a controversial poll of readers' most respected figures; the <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> the Islamic prophet Muhammad at number 10, below the dangdut singer Rhoma Irama.|$|E
5|$|Daniels' {{support for}} such {{controversial}} legislation {{led to a}} rapid drop in his approval rating; in May 2005, a <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> an 18-point drop in support and that only 42% of Hoosiers approved {{of the way he}} was doing his job. In the following months, many of his reforms began to have a positive effect; and his ratings began to improve, and his approval rebounded.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{what was}} {{initially}} {{expected to be}} a heated race, Gillibrand easily prevailed against former Republican congressman Joseph DioGuardi in her first statewide election. By the end of October, a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> Gillibrand winning 57-34%. Gillibrand won the November election 63–35%, carrying 54 of New York's 62 counties; the counties that supported DioGuardi did so by a margin no greater than 10%.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, 18 {{percent of}} {{respondents}} in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F.

5|$|Harper was {{the only}} Reform MP to support the {{creation}} of the Canadian Firearms Registry at second reading in 1995, although he later voted against it at third reading stage. He said {{at the time that he}} initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of his constituents supported it, and added that he changed his vote when a second <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest's leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.|$|E

5|$|Public {{perception}} of the anthem is mixed among Russians. The anthem reminds {{some of the best}} days of Russia and past sacrifices, while it reminds others of the violence that occurred under the rule of Stalin. The Russian government maintains that the anthem is a symbol of the unity of the people, and that it respects the past. A 2009 <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> that 56% of respondents felt proud when hearing the anthem, and that 25% liked it.|$|E
5|$|The anti-socialist crusade by the Ontario Conservative Party, mostly {{credited}} to the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) special investigative branch's agent D-208 (Captain William J. Osborne-Dempster) and the Conservative propagandists Gladstone Murray and Montague A. Sanderson, diminished the CCF's initially favourable position: the September 1943 Gallup <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> the CCF leading nationally with 29 percent support, with the Liberals and Conservatives {{tied for second}} place at 28 percent. By April 1945, the CCF was down to 20 percent nationally, and on election day it received only 16 percent.|$|E
5|$|A ruling of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 6 August 2017 {{decided that}} a disputed {{military}} facility in Han Pijesak is to be registered as property of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It {{is expected to be}} a precedent for all other similar facilities, and could thus be the final factor that will enable the activation of the MAP for Bosnia. An August 2010 <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> that 70 percent of the country supports NATO membership, but results were very different in the two constituent entities. While 90 percent of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina supported NATO membership, only 33 percent in Republika Srpska did.|$|E
50|$|After the {{deadline}} to file passed, four candidates (Castro, Cibrian, McNeil and DeBerry-Mejia) were considered the frontrunners in the race. <b>Polls</b> <b>showed</b> Castro ahead by big margins, and some <b>polls</b> <b>showed</b> Castro winning outright without {{need for a}} runoff election. Second place was highly contentious, with Cibrian and DeBerry-Mejia trading off for second place.|$|R
25|$|Polls {{over the}} course of the {{campaign}} indicated that the race was very competitive, with many <b>polls</b> <b>showing</b> Franken and Coleman virtually tied or within the margin of error, as well as several <b>polls</b> <b>showing</b> each candidate with a significant lead at one point or another. The presence of a serious third party candidate further complicated matters.|$|R

5|$|During {{his first}} year in office Williams and his {{government}} suffered low approval ratings. However, approval for Williams and his government dramatically improved in 2005. A <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> support for the Williams government was at 86 percent after Williams secured a deal with Federal Prime Minister Martin over equalization payments. The CRA poll in March 2006 showed 82 percent satisfaction with his government and 71 percent in William's premiership. Polling conducted throughout 2007, showed that support for Williams and his government remained high. In August 2007, the CRA found that 86 percent were satisfied with the government's performance; 77 percent supported Williams as premier, and 76 percent endorsed the PC party.|$|E
5|$|On June28, 1991, a {{few months}} before the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, the autonomous oblast declared its sovereignty and separated from Krasnodar Krai. It was subsequently recognized as the Republic of Adygea within the Russian SFSR and retained its status of a republic within the Russian Federation after the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991. Between 2004 and 2006, attempts were made to merge the republic with Krasnodar Krai, but the proposal met with strong resistance from the native Adyghe population and was eventually put to rest. The results of a 2011 opinion <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> that 83% of the population of Adygea and over 90% of the population of Krasnodar Krai regard a potential merger in an unfavorable light.|$|E
5|$|Polling done {{by various}} {{agencies}} in April and May 2014 showed incumbent Senator Jeanne Shaheen leading Brown by 3 to 5 points. A poll conducted in May by the Republican Governors Association showed Brown leading Jeanne Shaheen by 5 points. In late August, a WMUR/UNH <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> Shaheen leading Brown by two points, 46 to 44. Polling {{in the final}} few weeks of the election suggested Brown had pulled ahead of Shaheen, with weekly polls by NH1 News, New England College, and Vox Populi showing Brown leading {{by a margin of}} 1–4 percentage points for the three consecutive weeks leading up to the election.|$|E

5|$|The major Russian ORT TV station {{organised}} {{a national}} televised debate {{as to what}} should be done with the station. Former cosmonaut Georgi Grechko suggested that it should be kept in orbit long enough to salvage any useful equipment from it, for transfer to the International Space Station or other spacecraft, however Konstantin Feoktistov argued that it would cost more to retrieve the equipment than to replace it. Anatoly Artsebarsky argued that Mir should be kept because he believed that once it had been deorbited, the US would try to marginalise Russian involvement in the ISS. An online opinion <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> 67% support worldwide for keeping it in orbit.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, a CRA <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> {{that the}} Progressive Conservatives had fallen below the NDP, with 39 per cent {{indicating}} they supported the New Democrats and 38 per cent supporting the PC Party. The Liberal Party were third with 22 per cent support. Michael also surpassed Dunderdale when asked {{who would make}} the best premier, Michael was at 33 per cent and Dunderdale was at 32 per cent. This {{was also the first}} poll to show that more people were dissatisfied with government's performance then satisfied. An Angus Reid poll released on April 8, 2013, rating the performance of provincial premiers, showed that Dunderdale was the most unpopular premier in the country. Her approval rating was tied with British Columbia's Christy Clark at 25 per cent, while 73 per cent of respondents said they disapproved of Dunderdale's performance as premier.|$|E
5|$|Menem ran in 2003 {{and won the}} {{greatest}} number of votes, 24%, {{in the first round of}} the April 27, 2003 presidential election; but votes were split among numerous parties. 45% is required for election (or 40% if the margin of victory is 10 or more percentage points). A second-round run-off vote between Menem and second-place finisher, and fellow Peronist, Néstor Kirchner, who had received 22%, was scheduled for May 18. By that time, Menem had become very unpopular. Polls predicted that he faced almost certain defeat by Kirchner in the runoff. Most polls showed Kirchner taking at least 60 percent of the vote, and at least one <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> Menem losing by as many as 50 points. To avoid a humiliating electoral defeat, Menem withdrew his candidacy on May 14, effectively handing the presidency to Kirchner.|$|E

25|$|In a hard (and bitterly) fought campaign, early <b>polling</b> <b>showed</b> Nixon winning by a {{significant}} margin. The <b>polls</b> <b>showed</b> Brown—who {{made a point of}} not beginning to campaign until late in the season—closing the margin {{in the days before the}} election, but Nixon was still favored to win. Brown won the election, and the 5% margin stunned Nixon and political pundits nationwide.|$|R
