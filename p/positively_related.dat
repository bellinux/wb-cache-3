Similarly, there is evidence that public policies that reduce poverty and support a strong middle class, such as a higher minimum wage, strongly affects average levels of well-being.|$|E

25|$|Reefs {{are home}} to a large variety of animals, {{including}} fish, seabirds, sponges, cnidarians (which includes some types of corals and jellyfish), worms, crustaceans (including shrimp, cleaner shrimp, spiny lobsters and crabs), mollusks (including cephalopods), echinoderms (including starfish, sea urchins and sea cucumbers), sea squirts, sea turtles and sea snakes. Aside from humans, mammals are rare on coral reefs, with visiting cetaceans such as dolphins being the main exception. A few of these varied species feed directly on corals, while others graze on algae on the reef. Reef biomass is <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> to species diversity.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{evidence}} that other non-trait elements of personality may correlate with happiness. For instance, one study demonstrated that various features of one's goals, such as progress towards important goals or conflicts between them, can affect both emotional and cognitive well-being. Several {{other researchers have}} also suggested that, at least in more individualistic cultures, having a coherent sense of one's personality (and acting {{in a way that}} conforms to that self-concept) is <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> to well-being. Thus, focusing solely on extraversion—or even extraversion and neuroticism—is likely to provide an incomplete picture of the relationship between happiness and personality.|$|E

Females generally brood eggs for 9–10 months. Fecundity is generally between 4 and 81 young per female, but on average is closer to 11 young/female. Females can brood more than one batch of young at a time, and the number of young in one brood is <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> {{to the size of the}} female.

25|$|The {{national}} accounts balance would be <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> to carbon emissions. The {{national accounts}} balance shows {{the difference between}} exports and imports. For many richer nations, such as the United States, the accounts balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported. This is mostly {{due to the fact}} that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries, leading the economies of developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods. We believed that a positive accounts balance would means that more production was occurring in a country, so more factories working would increase carbon emission levels.(Holtz-Eakin, 1995, pp.;85;101).|$|E
25|$|The {{researchers}} also found TEIQue scores were unrelated to nonverbal reasoning (Raven's matrices), which they interpreted as {{support for the}} personality trait view of EI (as opposed {{to a form of}} intelligence). As expected, TEIQue scores were <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> to some of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness) as well as inversely related to others (alexithymia, neuroticism). A number of quantitative genetic studies have been carried out within the trait EI model, which have revealed significant genetic effects and heritabilities for all trait EI scores. Two recent studies (one a meta-analysis) involving direct comparisons of multiple EI tests yielded very favorable results for the TEIQue.|$|E
25|$|Immigrants {{may often}} do types {{of work that}} natives are largely unwilling to do, {{contributing}} to greater economic prosperity for {{the economy as a}} whole: for instance, Mexican migrant workers taking up manual farm work in the United States has close to zero effect on native employment in that occupation, which means that the effect of Mexican workers on U.S. employment outside farm work was therefore most likely positive, since they raised overall economic productivity. Research indicates that immigrants are more likely to work in risky jobs than U.S.-born workers, partly due to differences in average characteristics, such as immigrants' lower English language ability and educational attainment. Further, some studies indicate that higher ethnic concentration in metropolitan areas is <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> to the probability of self-employment of immigrants.|$|E

Results of Study 1 from a sample of 385 supervisor-subordinate dyads reveal that role modeling received by protégés <b>positively</b> <b>relates</b> to their OCB, and perceived mentoring relationship quality moderates the association between career support received and protégés' OCB. Moreover, nonprotégés and protégés who receive high levels of overall mentoring functions perform more OCB than protégés who receive low levels of mentoring functions. Results of Study 2 from 258 supervisor-subordinate dyads show that role modeling received by subordinates <b>positively</b> <b>relates</b> to their OCB directed at individuals (OCBI) and at the organization (OCBO) while career support received <b>positively</b> <b>relates</b> to OCBO.

40|$|Based on a meta-analysis, leaders' {{emotional}} intelligence (EI) <b>positively</b> <b>relates</b> to subordinates' job satisfaction (P = 0. 308). All three EI streams (ability, self-report, mixed) exhibit significant incremental validity and relative importance (RW) {{in the presence}} of personality and cognitive ability in predicting subordinates' job satisfaction (ability EI: ΔR 2 = 0. 002, RW% = 3. 5 %; self-report EI: ΔR 2 = 0. 021, RW% = 25. 3 %; mixed EI: ΔR 2 = 0. 085, RW% = 49. 9 %). Leaders' EI demonstrates significant incremental validity and RW {{in the presence of}} subordinates' EI in predicting subordinates' job satisfaction (leaders' EI: ΔR 2 = 0. 054, RW% = 48. 0 %). Subordinates' EI <b>positively</b> <b>relates</b> to leaders' EI and mediates the relationship between leaders' EI and subordinates' job satisfaction. Moderator analyses indicate that (1) ability EI has a lower association with subordinates' job satisfaction than self-report EI and mixed EI; and (2) leaders' EI more <b>positively</b> <b>relates</b> to subordinates' job satisfaction in low in-group collectivistic or low humane oriented cultures...|$|R

[...] Blackouts are alcohol-related amnesia, occurring when long term memory creation is impaired during a drinking episode, resulting in an inability to remember. The frequency of blackouts in young adults while drinking is strongly related to prenatal alcohol exposure; those exposed to alcohol as a fetus are more vulnerable to experiencing blackouts as an adult.Prenatal alcohol exposure can also lead to decreased problem solving skills and/or attention deficits. Attention deficits result in an inability to maintain focus on one task for a length of time, and being prone to distraction.|$|E
2500|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} has {{examined the effects of}} health status and health shocks on retirement.

This justification bias, however, is likely to be small. [...] In general, declining health over time, as well as the onset of new health conditions, have been found to be <b>positively</b> <b>related</b> to earlier retirement.
