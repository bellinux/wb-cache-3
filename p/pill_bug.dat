50|$|Roly poly bugs in {{the family}} Armadillidiidae are able to form their bodies into a ball shape, in {{a process known as}} conglobation. This {{behaviour}} is shared with pill millipedes (which are often confused with <b>pill</b> <b>bugs),</b> armadillos, and cuckoo wasps. It may be triggered by stimuli such as vibrations or pressure, and is a key defense against predation; it may also reduce respiratory water losses.|$|R
50|$|Armadillidae is {{a family}} of woodlice, (Oniscidea; {{terrestrial}} crustaceans). Comprising around 80 genera and 700 species, it the largest family of Oniscidea, {{and one of the}} most species-rich families of the entire Isopoda. Armadillids generally have a strongly convex body shape, with some rather shallowly convex. Like members of the woodlice family Armadillidiidae, armadillids are capable of enrolling into a sphere (conglobation), and are commonly known as <b>pill</b> <b>bugs.</b> Armadillids differ from the Armadillidiidae in that the antennae are fully enclosed within the sphere.|$|R
50|$|Gustav Henrik Andreas Budde-Lund (11 January 1846 - 19 September 1911) was a Danish {{invertebrate}} zoologist. In 1868, he co-founded the Entomologisk Forening, alongside Rasmus William Traugott Schlick, Carl August Møller, Andreas Haas and Ivar Frederik Christian Ammitzbøll. He was {{a student}} of entomologist J. C. Schiødte, and became a leading authority on terrestrial isopods (woodlice, <b>pill</b> <b>bugs</b> and relatives), describing over 70 genera and around 500 species.

50|$|Armadillidiidae is {{a family}} of woodlice, a {{terrestrial}} crustacean group in the order Isopoda. Unlike members of other woodlouse families, members of this family can roll into a ball, an ability they share with the outwardly similar but unrelated pill millipedes and other animals. This ability gives woodlice in this family their common names of pill bugs, roly polies, or doodle bugs. The best known species in the family is Armadillidium vulgare, the common <b>pill</b> <b>bug.</b>|$|E
50|$|Members of {{the largest}} subfamily, Chrysidinae, are the most familiar; they are {{generally}} kleptoparasites, laying their eggs in host nests, where their larvae consume the host egg or larva while it is still young, then the food provided by the host for its own juvenile.

5000|$|Armadillidium [...] is a genus of {{the small}} {{terrestrial}} crustacean known as the woodlouse. Armadillidium are also commonly known as pill woodlice, leg pebbles, <b>pill</b> <b>bugs,</b> roly-poly, or potato bugs, and are often confused with pill millipedes such as Glomeris marginata. They are characterised by their ability to roll into a ball when disturbed. They typically feed on moss, algae, bark and other decaying organic matter. They are usually found in moist areas such as decomposing leaf matter and soil. Armadillidium vulgare is the most abundant species in Europe and has been introduced worldwide. However, {{the vast majority of}} species are endemic to small regions close to the Mediterranean Sea, in much lower numbers than common species such as A. vulgare, and hence are understudied.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other {{terrestrial}} arthropods such as {{insects and}} spiders, pill bugs {{do not have}} a waxy cuticle that would reduce evaporation from their bodies. Pill bugs also use modified lungs, called pseudotrachea, for respiration, and the lungs must remain moist to function. Individual pill bugs typically live for two or three years, and females brood eggs once or twice each summer. Several hundred eggs are brooded at a time in the marsupium, a pocket on the ventral side of the female <b>pill</b> <b>bug.</b> The marsupium must also be kept filled with water until the young hatch and crawl away.|$|E
50|$|The term deep-sea {{gigantism}} {{describes an}} effect that living at such depths has on some creatures' sizes, especially {{relative to the}} size of relatives that live in different environments. These creatures are generally many times bigger than their counterparts. The giant isopod (related to the common <b>pill</b> <b>bug)</b> exemplifies this. To date, scientists have only been able to explain deep-sea gigantism {{in the case of the}} giant tube worm. Scientists believe these creatures are much larger than shallower-water tube worms because they live on hydrothermal vents that expel huge amounts of resources. They believe that, since the creatures don't have to expend energy regulating body temperature and have a smaller need for activity, they can allocate more resources to bodily processes.|$|E
5000|$|Phacops rana can be {{recognized}} by its large eyes (which remind some observers of a frog's eyes [...] - [...] the specific name rana is {{a reference to a}} common frog), its fairly large size (up to 6 inches long), and its habit of rolling up into a ball like a <b>pill</b> <b>bug.</b> In order to protect themselves from predators, Phacops rana would roll into a ball with its hard exoskeleton on the outside as protection. Many other trilobites possessed the same ability, but Phacops rana nearly perfected it. The slightest amount of sediment would trigger their senses, and Phacops rana would be hidden in a tiny shelter made of its own body. [...] Although this safety feature often helped them to evade predators, occasionally it backfired and the trilobite would be buried under heavy sediment. Their fossils can still be found in balled-up positions 400 million years later.|$|E

50|$|In China, Trissolcus japonicus, a {{parasitoid}} wasp {{species in}} the family Scelionidae, is a primary predator. This species is not currently present in the U.S., but is undergoing study for possible introduction. The major problem with this idea {{is the possibility that}} japonicus will also become an invasive species with no native predators. Before introducing the Chinese wasp, scientists are trying to find natural predators of the stink bug already present in the United States. To do so they have studied other species of parasitoid wasps native to the United States. They found that several other species of the parasitoid wasps attacked stink bug eggs in Virginia soybean fields. Researchers have also experimented with different spider species as well as the Wheel bug. Several spider species attacked both the eggs as well as live stink <b>bugs.</b> <b>Pill</b> <b>bugs</b> eat stinkbug eggs. The Wheel bug, however, was the most voracious predator and attacked the eggs as well as stink bugs more consistently. Scientists are hoping that other animals such as birds will eventually begin preying on stink bugs as populations continue to rise.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a possible new defensive behaviour of larval stages of mantis shrimps (Stomatopoda). Mantis shrimp larvae are rarely observed in nature, thus {{the study is}} based on postures of museum material and functional morphological aspects. Specimens described here are tightly enrolled, their pleon is bent forward,and the telson is locked into the frontal margin of the shield. This margin has two lobes into which the two posterolateral spines of the telson fit. The shield shows further adaptions to enrolment; e. g., the ventral gape of the shield perfectly matches {{the width of the}} pleon and leaves no major gaps when the pleon is bent forward. Based on these observations, we briefly discuss the possibilities to infer behavioural aspects from functional morphological aspects. Enrolment in modern day organisms is primarily known from terrestrial arthropods, e. g., <b>pill</b> <b>bugs</b> and <b>pill</b> millipedes, but in the Palaeozoic it was mainly performed by marine organisms such as trilobites, agnostines and their relatives. Stomatopod larvae that appear to be able to perform enrolling in a marine environment are therefore a potential functional equivalent for better understanding the functional aspects of enrolment in extinct marine arthropods...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn the <b>pill</b> <b>bug</b> Armadillidium vulgare (Crustacea, Oniscidea), Wolbachia {{facilitates}} its {{spread through}} vertical transmission via the eggs by inducing feminization of genetic males. The spread of feminizing Wolbachia {{within and across}} populations is therefore expected to influence mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic structure by hitchhiking. To test this hypothesis, we analysed nuclear and mtDNA genetic structure, and Wolbachia prevalence in 13 populations of the <b>pill</b> <b>bug</b> host. Wolbachia prevalence (ranging from 0 % to 100 % of sampled females) was highly variable among populations. All three Wolbachia strains previously observed in A.  vulgare were present (wVulC, wVulM and wVulP) with wVulC being the most prevalent (nine of 13 populations). The host showed a genetic structure on five microsatellite loci that is compatible with isolation by distance. The strong genetic structure observed on host mtDNA was correlated with Wolbachia prevalence: three mitotypes were in strong linkage disequilibrium with the three strains of Wolbachia. Neutrality tests showed that the mtDNA polymorphism is not neutral, and we thus suggest that this unusual pattern of mtDNA polymorphism found in A.  vulgare was due to Wolbachia...|$|E

In order to study {{the effect of the}} presence of Wolbachia on the evolution of A. vulgare populations, we developed and characterized a set of nine polymorphic microsatellite loci from two microsatellite-enriched genomic libraries. We screened 48 individuals from three French populations and found high genetic variation. Locus-specific allelic diversity ranged from four to 28 and observed heterozygosity from 0. 40 to 1. 00, which indicates that these markers can be used to conduct population genetic studies in A. vulgare...|$|E
40|$|Twelve <b>pill</b> <b>bugs</b> (Armadillidium vulgare, Isopoda, Cmstacean) were {{examined}} in 200 successive T-mazes. When obstacles are present, A. vulgare tend to move by means of turn alternation, which is generally considered an innate adaptive behavior. With a decrease in air moisture, the bugs {{have a tendency to}} increase their turn alternation rate. However, in such long successive T-mazes as in this study, continued turn alternation should actually accelerate the bugs' desiccation. This fact implies that turn alternation cannot always work adaptively. In this trade-off situation, while three individuals kept turn alternation at a high rate (1) and four at a low rate, (2), the other five spontaneously increased the rate of turn alternation and then decreased it (3). This instability of turn alternation in group (3) is interpreted as resulting not from stochastic factors but rather from the bugs' own decision-making, and seems to be anescape behavior used {{to get out of the}} experimental apparatus. In order to verify thedecision-making hypothesis, all animals were subsequently tested in another successive T-maze apparatus, where the ends of the chosen alleys were shut, i. e., with 50 successive blind alleys. In this situation, while individuals of groups (1) and (2) continued to wander inside the apparatus, those of group (3) found a vertical roughwall, climbed it, and escaped from the apparatus in the middle of the experiment. Mostof the unexercised individuals in the control experiment did not show climbingbehavio...|$|R
40|$|Background: Wolbachia are {{vertically}} transmitted bacteria {{known to}} be the most widespread endosymbiont in arthropods. They induce various alterations of the reproduction of their host, including feminization of genetic males in isopod crustaceans. In the <b>pill</b> <b>bug</b> Armadillidium vulgare, the presence of Wolbachia is also associated with detrimental effects on host fertility and lifespan. Deleterious effects have been demonstrated on hemocyte density, phenoloxidase activity, and natural hemolymph septicemia, suggesting that infected individuals could have defective immune capacities. Since nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in Wolbachia-A. vulgare interactions and its secondary immunocompetence modulation, we developed a transcriptomics strategy and compared A. vulgare gene expression between Wolbachia-infected animals (i. e., “symbiotic ” animals) and uninfected ones (i. e., “asymbiotic ” animals) as well as between animals challenged or not challenged by a pathogenic bacteria. Results: Since very little genetic data is available on A. vulgare, we produced several EST libraries and generated a total of 28 606 ESTs. Analyses of these ESTs revealed that immune processes were over-represented in most experimental conditions (responses to a symbiont and to a pathogen). Considering canonical crustacean immune pathways, these genes encode antimicrobial peptides or are involved in pathogen recognition, detoxification, an...|$|E
40|$|Female sex {{determination}} in the <b>pill</b> <b>bug</b> Armadillidium vulgare is frequently {{under the control}} of feminizing parasitic sex factors (PSF). One of these PSF is an intracytoplasmic Wolbachia-like bacterium (F), while the other (f) is suspected of being an F-bacterial DNA sequence unstably integrated into the host genome. In most wild populations harboring PSF, all individuals are genetic males (ZZ), and female phenotypes occur only due to the presence of PSF which overrides the male determinant carried by the Z chromosome (females are thus ZZ +F or ZZ +f neo-females). Here we report the effects of the conflict between these PSF and a dominant autosomal masculinizing gene (M) on phenotypes. The M gene is able to override the feminizing effect of the f sex factor and, consequently, male sex may be restored. However, M is unable to restore male sex when competing with the F bacteria. It seems that the main effect of M is to delay the expression of F bacteria slightly, inducing intersex phenotypes. Most of these intersexes are functional females, able to transmit the masculinizing gene. The frequency of M and its effects on the sex ratio in wild populations are discussed...|$|E
