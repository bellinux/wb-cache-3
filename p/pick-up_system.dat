30|$|In {{order to}} measure magnetizations in pulsed-fields, an {{inductive}} method using a pick-up coil {{located in a}} pulse magnet is generally employed.

30|$|Measurement of magnetizations {{during a}} short {{interval}} (1 – 10  ms) of a pulsed field generated by pulse magnet {{has long been}} employed in various fields of experimental physics (e.g., Grössinger 1982; Grössinger et al. 1993; Miura 2007; Lv et al. 2013). Since {{the invention of the}} pulse magnet by Kapitza (1924), magnetometry using the pulsed field up to 100  T, the pulsed field magnetometry (PFM), has led to a variety of applications, such as NMR, magnetostriction, magneto-optical spectroscopy, and characterization of permanent magnets (e.g., Ludwig et al. 2002; Dudding et al. 2002; Haase et al. 2004; Meier et al. 2011). Unlike the static-field techniques using superconducting magnets, PFM is cost-effective and reliable for measuring the magnetization of samples in high fields in the 10 -T range (e.g., Grössinger 1982). <b>Pick-up</b> coil <b>systems</b> are generally used in PFM, and the derivative signal of the magnetization is useful especially for the identification of the phase change of magnetic materials in high fields (e.g., Mizutani et al. 1998; Nojiri et al. 2007; Takeyama et al. 2012).|$|R
30|$|The key to {{constructing}} the <b>pick-up</b> coil <b>system</b> {{is to achieve}} the accurate compensation of the two oppositely wound coils. It is expected that {{a larger number of}} coil windings would result in higher sensitivity. However, as discussed by Kodama (2015), the stray capacitance and the impedance of the pick-up coils increase with an increasing number of coil windings. This leads to a high-frequency resonance of the pick-up coil for the short interval (< 1  ms) of {{the rise and fall of}} a pulse. The resonance is stronger with higher pulsed fields, resulting in the lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This problem was already pointed out by Likhite et al. (1985) who was forced to limit the pulse peak < 0.6  T due to the imbalance of pick-up coil caused by “ringing” of the coil system. In the same way, because a slight failure of the coil compensation contributes to greater reduction of the SNR, we found that the maximum peak of a pulse was set to 0.7  T in this study. In addition, the measurement without a sample was performed for each run, and this background signal was subtracted from the signal with the sample.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} magnetic pick-up coil transfer functions on mode number analysis in magnetically confined fusion plasmas. Magnetic probes mounted inside the vacuum chamber are widely used to characterize the mode structure of magnetohydrodynamic modes, as, due to their relative simplicity and compact nature, several coils can be distributed over the vessel. Phase differences between the transfer functions of different magnetic pick-up coils lead to systematic errors in time- and frequency resolved mode number analysis. This paper presents the first in-situ, end-to-end calibration of a magnetic <b>pick-up</b> coil <b>system</b> which {{was carried out by}} using an in-vessel driving coil on ASDEX Upgrade. The effect of the phase differences in the pick-up coil transfer functions is most significant in the 50 - 250 kHz frequency range, where the relative phase shift between the different probes can be up to 1 radian (60). By applying a correction based on the transfer functions we found smaller residuals of mode number fitting in the considered discharges. In most cases an order of magnitude improvement was observed in the residuals of the mode number fits, which could open the way to investigate weaker electromagnetic oscillations with even high mode numbers...|$|R

40|$|The cable-in-conduit superconductors for the ITER coils have {{operating}} current {{in excess of}} 40 kA and function under last ramp conditions and fields up to 13 T. The transverse Lorentz force acting on strands may reduce the effective contact resistance between strands in the cable and as a consequence, the coupling loss will increase. This influence is investigated with a sub-size jacketed cable having 81 Cr-coated Nb 3 Sn strands. The AC loss is measured with a sinusoidal and trapezoidal magnetic field superimposed to a stationary background field of 1 or 2 T while the cable carries a constant transport current up to about 30 kA. The AC loss is determined by a <b>pick-up</b> coil <b>system</b> and partly with a calorimeter for calibration purposes. The nτ at 0 current declines after cyclic loading, from 9 ms in the virgin state to 2 ms after several loads. The increase of the interstrand coupling loss due to Lorentz effects, accompanied by resistance-hysteresis and relaxation effects as observed in the loss are discussed.
