25|$|The {{basin and}} range {{topography}} of northern Nevada and the extensive and flat Snake River Plain characterize the geologically young Salmon Falls Creek basin. The Basin and Range area {{was created by}} crustal stretching along an area dense in faults running north to south, with valleys forming along the fault lines. Sediments deposited by streams and lakes in the Pliocene and Miocene filled much of the present-day main stem valley. Lower on the creek, basalt rocks of volcanic origin and thick deposits of loess soil compose the <b>primary</b> <b>surface</b> geology. Beginning about 12 million years ago, the North American Plate slowly passed over a large volcanic hotspot, which formed and caused frequent volcanic activity throughout the Snake River Plain. The hotspot, which now lies beneath Yellowstone National Park, deposited massive lava flows throughout the plain. About 14,500 years ago, the Bonneville Flood rushed through the Snake River Plain, carving out and extending many canyons including lower Salmon Falls Creek Canyon. The extent of the floods {{was so great that}} most of lower Salmon Falls Creek pooled up into a temporary lake as miles of land were submerged {{on both sides of the}} Snake. Wind-blown soil and sediment deposited by the floods have covered most of the basalt, which is still exposed in areas such as Salmon Falls Creek Canyon.|$|E

50|$|To {{provide for}} a safe {{environment}} to perform normal helicopter landing and takeoff operations each heliport must have unobstructed approach/departure paths. At a minimum the FAA recommends {{that there should be}} two approach departure path so that pilots have viable unobstructed routes into and out of a heliport under multiple wind conditions. The minimum recommended separation between flight paths is 135 degrees. A heliport approach path is broken down into two distinct airspace surfaces, the Approach Surface and the Transitional Surface.

In {{this paper}} {{we give the}} topological {{classification}} of real <b>primary</b> Kodaira <b>surfaces</b> and we describe in detail {{the structure of the}} corresponding moduli space.

Our first result is that if (S, σ) is a real <b>primary</b> Kodaira <b>surface,</b> then the differentiable type of the pair (S, σ) is completely determined by the orbifold fundamental group exact sequence.
