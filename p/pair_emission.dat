In experiments, this is usually ensured simply by prohibiting any light-speed communication by separating the two sites and then ensuring that the measurement duration is shorter than the time it would take for any light-speed signal from one site to the other, or indeed, to the source. In one of Alain Aspect's experiments, inter-detector communication at light speed during the time between <b>pair</b> <b>emission</b> and detection was possible, but such communication between the time of fixing the detectors' settings and the time of detection was not. An experimental set-up without any such provision effectively becomes entirely [...] "local", and therefore cannot rule out local realism. Additionally, the experiment design will ideally be such that the settings for each measurement are not determined by any earlier event, at both measurement stations.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore a}} {{possibility}} of measuring the absolute magnitude and the nature (Majorana vs Dirac) of neutrino masses, by using a novel process of neutrino <b>pair</b> <b>emission</b> from metastable excited atoms. Except lepton number non-conserving processes, the neutrino pair (ν¯ν) emission is the unique process to directly distinguish the Majorana neutrino from the Dirac neutrino, using the interference effect of identical fermions. The small energy difference between atomic levels {{makes it easier to}} measure small neutrino masses as indicated by neutrino oscillation experiments. The crucial point is how to enhance the rate of <b>pair</b> <b>emission</b> without enhancing the radiative decay. We discuss two particular cases; (1) laser irradiated <b>pair</b> <b>emission</b> from metastable atoms, and (2) microwave irradiated emission from circular Rydberg states. A new mechanism of the parametric amplification to enhance the neutrino <b>pair</b> <b>emission</b> is pointed out when Rydberg atoms are 1 irradiated by microwave, while the radiative process may be inhibited by the cavity QED effect. A great variety of measurable neutrino parameters and a variety of experimental methods make this investigation attractive. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The optical {{properties}} of Cu-poor CuIn 1 -xGaxSe 2 thin films with different gallium contents grown by co-evaporated technique were studied. Measurements of photoluminescence and photoreflectance {{were performed on}} the samples. The photoluminescence and photoreflectance emission peaks observed around 1. 1 eV are attributed to donor-acceptor pair luminescence. These donor-acceptor <b>pair</b> <b>emissions</b> are considered to originate from relatively shallow acceptor and donor energy levels. With increasing gallium content, the emission peaks shift towards higher levels of photon energy, and the linewidths of the luminescence spectra for the samples become wider, which we attributes to the greater statistical disorder between indium and gallium. Moreover, the conversion efficiency of the CuIn 1 -xGaxSe 2 -based solar cells is obtained. The measured results coincide with the inference given by the photoluminescence spectra...|$|R

However, we show that such superluminal neutrinos would lose energy rapidly via the bremsstrahlung of electron-positron pairs (ν→ν+e^-+e^+). For the claimed superluminal neutrino velocity and at the stated mean neutrino energy, we find {{that most of the}} neutrinos would have suffered several <b>pair</b> <b>emissions</b> en route, causing the beam to be depleted of higher energy neutrinos. Thus we refute the superluminal interpretation of the OPERA result.

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} <b>pairs</b> of <b>emission</b> bands present for atomic zinc isolated in annealed solid argon, krypton, and xenon samples is examined in steady-state and time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy. The <b>pairs</b> of <b>emission</b> bands in all the Zn/RG systems exhibited a reversible {{temperature dependence}} whereby {{the intensity of the}} high-energy band decreased, while the low-energy band gained in intensity with increasing temperature. In the Zn/Ar system, the decrease in the intensity of the 218. 9 nm emission band observed between 9 and 28 K was coupled with a concomitant increase in the intensity of the band at 238 nm. In this temperature range the decay times of the 218. 9 nm band decreased while the 238 nm band exhibited a constant decay time of 1. 41 ns and a rise time correlated with the decay of the 218. 9 nm band. The interdependence exhibited by the intensities and decay times of the two emission bands is modeled by an activated nonradiative process with a barrier height of 130. 6 [*]cm− 1 for population interconversion between the pairs of emitting levels on of the spin singlet adiabatic potential energy surface. Similar behavior was observed in Zn/Kr between 6. 3 to 20 K, but at higher temperatures this system also exhibited enhanced intersystem crossing. Likewise, for Zn/Xe, the low-energy 399 nm emission increased in intensity {{at the expense of the}} high-energy 356 nm emission up to a temperature of 40 K.

The long range alpha and pair curves exhibit resonance peaks superimposed on a background of increasing intensity with increasing bombarding energy. Approximate coincidence in two instances of pair and alpha-resonances suggests that full range alphas and the short range alphas preceding <b>pair</b> <b>emission</b> can be products of competing modes of decay of the same intermediate states of Ne 20.

The quenching resonances are identified as electrons and holes occupying tail states, which participate in non-radiative recombination. The 1. 25 eV emission and 0. 9 eV emission are both associated with a resonance near g = 2. 006, suggesting a radiative dangling bond.

In Zn/Ar the <b>pair</b> of <b>emission</b> bands were observed in the uv at 218. 9 and 238 nm and for Zn/Xe in the near-uv at 356 and 399 nm. For the Zn/Kr system two emission bands were observed in the uv region at 239. 5 and 259 nm but in addition, a weaker band was present in the near-uv at 315. 6 nm. In a given annealed rare-gas host, the excitation profiles recorded for all the emission bands are identical, exhibiting the threefold splitting characteristic of Jahn-Teller coupling in the triply degenerate excited 1 P 1 state. These excitation profiles are identified as the solid phase equivalent of the 4 p[*] 1 P 1 ← 4 s[*] 1 S 0 resonance transition of atomic zinc occurring at 213. 9 nm in the gas phase. Based on their spectral positions and temporal decay characteristics, the emission bands observed in the uv and near-uv spectral regions have been assigned as the singlet and triplet transitions, respectively, of atomic zinc. The origin of the <b>pairs</b> of <b>emission</b> bands is ascribed to the Jahn-Teller coupling between noncubic vibronic modes of the lattice and the excited 4 p orbital of the 1 P 1 state of atomic zinc, resulting in the coexistence of two energy minima.

In the dressed cascade two-photon emission, the coincidence counting rate may exhibit a damped Rabi oscillation, in contrast with a simple exponential decay feature in the literatures.

All the observed damped Rabi oscillations in the two-photon coincidences result from the destructive interference among the possible four-wave mixing processes occurring in the atom-field interaction system. This feature of the two-photon amplitude is governed by the convolution between the phase matching and third-order nonlinear susceptibility.
