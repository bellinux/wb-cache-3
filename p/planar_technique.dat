40|$|Abstract Pressurized planar {{electrochromatography}} (PPEC) is a separating {{technique in}} which an electric field is applied to force the mobile phase movement through a por-ous media (electroosmotic effect). High separation effi-ciency, fast separations and changes in separation selectivity in comparison to liquid chromatography, especially thin layer chromatography (planar chromatography, TLC), are features of this technique. Constructional methodological challenges to PPEC are obstacles to its development and application in laboratory practice. In this article, an attempt to overcome the challenges related to device construction and sample application/injection is described. The intro-duced device enables both prewetting of the adsorbent layer and electrochromatogram development with a single PPEC device.

Four methods of tomosynthesis-tuned aperture computed tomography (TACT) -backprojection, TACT-iterative restoration, iterative reconstruction with expectation maximization, and Bayesian smoothing-were compared to planar mammography and analyzed {{in terms of their}} contrast-detail characteristics. Specific comparisons between the tomosynthesis methods were not attempted in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A full-field, amorphous, silicon-based, flat-panel digital mammographic system was used to obtain planar and tomosynthesis projection images. A composite tomosynthesis phantom with a centrally located contrast-detail insert was used as the object of interest. The total exposure for multiple views with tomosynthesis was always equal to or less than that for the <b>planar</b> <b>technique.</b> Algorithms were used to reconstruct the object from the acquired projections. RESULTS: Threshold contrast characteristics with all tomosynthesis reconstruction methods were significantly better than those with planar mammography, even when planar mammography was performed at more than twice the exposure level. Reduction of out-of-plane structural components was observed in all the tomosynthesis methods analyzed. CONCLUSION: The contrast-detail trends of all the tomosynthesis methods analyzed in this study were better than those of planar mammography.

40|$|Abstract Acute {{pulmonary}} embolism (PE) is diagnosed ei-ther by ventilation/perfusion (V/P) scintigraphy or pulmonary CTangiography (CTPA). In recent years both techniques have improved. Many nuclear medicine centres {{have adopted the}} single photon emission CT (SPECT) technique {{as opposed to the}} <b>planar</b> <b>technique</b> for diagnosing PE. SPECT has been shown to have fewer indeterminate results and a higher diag-nostic value. The latest improvement is the combination of a low-dose CT scan with a V/P SPECT scan in a hybrid tomograph. In a study comparing CTPA, planar scintigraphy and SPECT alone, SPECT/CT had the best diagnostic accu-racy for PE. In addition, recent developments in the CTPA technique have made it possible to image the pulmonary arteries of the lungs in one breath-hold. This development is based on the change from a single-detector to multidetector CT technology with an increase in volume coverage per rotation and faster rotation. Furthermore, the dual energy CT technique is a promising modality that can provide functional imaging in combination with anatomical information. Newer high-end CT scanners and SPECT systems are able to visual-ize smaller subsegmental emboli. However, consensus is lack-ing regarding the clinical impact and treatment. In the present review, SPECTand SPECT in combination with low-dose CT, CTPA and dual energy CT are discussed in the context of diagnosing PE...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of coronary balloon angioplasty in the clinical arena, percutaneous catheter- based interventions are perfornled with coronary angiographic guidance, depicting the lumen of an entire coronary artery in certain angiographicviews. Subsequently, quantitative coronary angiography was developed as an instnullent for off-line quantitative analysis of the acute and long-tenn effects of catheter-based and phanl 1 acological approaches on atherosclerotic lesions and on lesion recurrence following angioplasty. Despite some inherent limitations, tills analysis method became generally accepted for on-line guidance of balloon angioplasty and alternative catheterbased techniques. Thereafter, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was introduced as a new imaging method that provided deeper insights into the pathology of coronary artery disease by defining vessel wall geometry and the major components of the atherosclerotic plaque. Although invasive, IVUS is safe and allows in vivo a more comprehensive assessment of the plaque than the 'luminal silhouette' furnished by coronary angiography. as it provides transmural cross-sectional inlaging of coronary arteries and allows diameter and area measurements of both lumen and atherosclerotic plaque.

40|$|Dense {{matching}} {{and image}} segmentation are fundamental image analysis operations. These operations {{are required by}} many computer vision applications. Artificial view-synthesis, 3 D scene reconstruction, token tracking and augmented reality are examples of applications that rely heavily on these primitives. The speed and accuracy of such applications rely {{on the quality of}} the matching and segmentation. As a result, solutions to these problems have been widely researched. However, due to the difficulty of these problems, there is no universal solution. Most solutions to these two problems make certain assumptions. First, dense matching and image segmentation are often viewed as separate problems. Second, most image segmentation techniques operate on only a single image. This introduces a technique that simultaneously performs image segmentation and dense matching of planar surfaces in a stereo pair of images. Using three matched points from an arbitrary plane, and four other matched points, a projective mapping, known as a homography, is calculated. This homography is used to iteratively grow a region in both images. The result is a matched and segmented plane. Practical tests comparing the computation time of this method to traditional matching techniques are presented. These results are used to motivate the use of the <b>planar</b> <b>technique</b> as a primary step for reducing the overall computation time for dense matching and image segmentation.

The pathophysiology of cerebral venous thrombosis with associated venous stroke appears to differ from that of arterial strokes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe DWI findings in venous strokes. Methods. The authors reviewed 3 adults with superior sagittal sinus thrombosis who underwent DWI and magnetic resonance imaging within 24 hours of symptom onset. DWI was obtained at 1. 5 T using the multishot echo <b>planar</b> <b>technique</b> (TR = 8000, TE = 97, field of view = 30 ? 19 cm, slice thickness = 6. 0 mm, interslice gap = 0. 5 mm, matrix 128 ? 128, NEX = 1). The diffusion gradients were applied in 3 orthogonal directions with 3 increasing b values (0 – 1000 s/mm 2) to create average (trace) DWI images. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis and displayed as ADC maps. Results. DWI showed hyperintensities in patients 1 and 2 and hypointensity in patient 3 in corresponding to parenchymal lesions on conventional images. As compared to the homologous uninvolved location in the contralateral hemisphere, ADC values were decreased (0. 53 ? 10 − 3 mm 2 /s [patient 1] and 0. 68 − 3 mm 2 /s [patient 2]) and increased (1. 1 ? 10 − 3 mm 2 /s [patient 3]). The ADC ratio of the lesion in the involved to uninvolved side was 88 % (patient 1), 81 % (patient 2), and 120 % (patient 3). Conclusion.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis {{experimental}} investigation to study turbulent flame characteristics using laser based methods is presented. Combustion inside almost all technical industrial devices takes place under turbulent environment. In addition, {{a significant amount}} of effort is ongoing to improve the knowledge of turbulent combustion. This work is focussed on the turbulent-chemistry interaction, which remains to be the bottleneck problem in turbulent combustion. Combustion flames from turbulent opposed jet burner and swirl stabilized burner have been investigated using laser induced fluorescence utilizing single-point, single-scalar as well as state of the art multi-scalar, <b>planar</b> <b>technique.</b> Investigation on flames from turbulent opposed jet burner has been carried out. With the same burner set-up, flames from the partially-premixed mode to the premixed mode have been studied while varying parameters like Reynolds numbers and equivalence ratio. The results from the current work provide a detailed insight on flame physics, flame front characteristics, flame front dynamics and extinction phenomenon. Local flame area distribution results have been evaluated and used to confirm for the flame symmetry of turbulent opposed jet burner. It is found that flame stability is decreased not due to small wrinkling of the flame front but due to the total flame stretch, thus confirming the presence of "young turbulence". Young turbulence is characterized by large eddies that yet do not have decayed to smaller structures along the turbulent energy cascade due to limited residence time. In addition it is also concluded that flame extinction phenomenon is due to the large eddies rather than small eddies that disrupts the reaction zone. A technical relevant lean premixed flame from a swirled stabilized turbulent jet burner was used as another test case. Location of peak heat release rate using state of the art planar laser induced fluorescence has been studied in this flame. Single laser system has been used to simultaneously detect two molecular species namely, hydroxyl [OH] and formaldehyde [HCHO]. Snap-shot of peak heat release rate have been provided by simultaneously multiplying spatially and temporarily matched images from both detected molecule. 1000 single-shot images have been taken to build sufficient and clean statistical results. In addition to the experimental work, advanced image processing routines have been developed and applied for automatic data enhancement and analysis. Several algorithms employing filters, smoothing functions and image enhancement were tested and checked for their end results. Sensitive analysis to choose the combination of right parameters has been also done and is specific to the images evaluated in the present work. Lastly, experimental investigation from the current thesis will help in building a data bank for such flames. As the numerical models due to their limitations, requires experimental information to test for their efficacy and capabilities, these results will help to validate numerical models...|$|E
