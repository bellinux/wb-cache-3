30|$|The {{acquisition}} system was composed of: (i) two laser displacement-sensors (PM Instruments, LDS, FSO 30  mm, 0.01 %), and (ii) a two-axes XY-robot (Robostar, ROK stroke 300  mm, payload 40  kg) for the sensor positioning. The system was assembled using an industrial mounting system (Montech, Quickset series) characterized of high flexional rigidity and low <b>perpendicularity</b> <b>tolerance.</b> An industrial pc (National Instruments, PXI- 8105) {{equipped with a}} 16  bit DAQ acquisition device, and with an custom LabVIEW application (NI, US), triggered the motors and acquired signals. In order to prevent any possible damage, we built the control software to preclude that the laser beam could remain still on the tested artifact for hardware or software bad functioning. Thus, to preserve {{the integrity of the}} surface, a disaster recovery procedure was implemented: the measurement heads are automatically moved in a safe location outside the painting and switched off when an alarm code is identified by the in-house developed control software.|$|E
40|$|The {{standards}} and methods concerning assignment of rolling bearing fit with shafts and frames via example of bearing 6 - 208 are analyzed. We set certain differences of recommendations according to GOST 3325 - 85, "Rolling bearings. Tolerance zones and technical requirements to mounting surfaces of shafts and frames. Attachment" and by reference of rolling bearing manufacturers. The following factors {{should be taken}} into consideration when assigning the mounting with the tension the internal ring of the bearing with shaft and mounting with a gap in the outer ring with a housing bore. The methods of achieving accuracy of mounting surfaces of shafts and frames via form tolerance assignment: roundness tolerance, profile of longitudinal cut, cross section, cylindricity and others. It is possible to limit the bearing rings in different ways, for example appointing the cylindrical mounting surfaces and bead end surfaces the appropriate tolerances, namely: coaxiality tolerance or full radial beat of mounting surfaces, and also <b>perpendicularity</b> <b>tolerance,</b> butt beats and full butt beats of mounting end surfaces. We suggest to expand methods of achieving the accuracy of shafts and frames depending on seriation of production and production operations metrology support. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} avoid final product {{malfunction}} and to allow for assembly integration, geometric specifications and dimensional tolerances are commonly used in mechanical design. However the feasibility of geometric specification measurement and verification is often neglected {{and the influence of}} measurement uncertainty in geometric tolerances evaluation underestimated. The authors propose updated results of a mathematical and numerical model, based on Monte Carlo simulations, developed in order to define a measurability threshold of geometric tolerances in relation to measurement uncertainty and geometric parameters, such as feature dimensions, meant to help the designer to define measurable geometric specifications. Starting from EN ISO 14253 - 2 : 2011 and EN ISO 14253 - 3 : 2011 standards, a <b>perpendicularity</b> <b>tolerance</b> between a cylindrical feature and a planar one has been simulated. A mathematical model has been defined for each feature, in order to assess both misalignment and its uncertainty when starting from the estimate of geometric entities obtained from point coordinates measured by a Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM). Monte Carlo Analysis of these simulation underlined how geometric parameters, such as dimensions of the features involved, can act as magnifiers for measurement uncertainty when verifying a geometric specification: there could be cases where this magnification effect could lead to non-measurability of misalignment and non-verifiability of the geometrical specification requested...|$|E

ABSTRACT: The objective {{of this paper is}} to present the analysis of geometric tolerances of the assembly design with the deviations and clearance method, for this we will study initially the tolerance analysis using the worst case method, in a second step we will integrate statistical Tolerancing approach, and finally we will integrate form deviations of the parts to study the impact of these deviations on the tolerance analysis. To illustrate this process of analysis we used a classic case of assembly and we considered the location <b>tolerance</b> (<b>perpendicularity)</b> and the form tolerance (flatness). Finally, a comparative study between the two statistical methods was illustrated...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} quality of CO 2 laser cutting of hot {{stamping}} boron steel sheets that are employed in the fabrication of automotive body-in-white. For this purpose, experimental laser cutting tests were conducted on 1. 2 mm sheets at varying levels of laser power, cutting speed, and oxygen pressure. The resulting quality of cut edges was evaluated in terms of <b>perpendicularity</b> <b>tolerance,</b> surface irregularity, kerf width, heat affected zone, and dross extension. Experimental tests {{were based on a}} L 9 (34) orthogonal array design, with the effects of the process parameters on the quality responses being determined by means of a statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA). Quadratic mathematical models were developed to determine the relationships between the cutting parameters and the quality responses. Finally, a routine based on an optimization criterion was employed to predict the optimal setting of cutting factors and its effect on the quality responses. A confirmation experiment was conducted to verify the appropriateness of the optimization routine. The results show that all of the examined process parameters have a key role in determining the cut quality of hot stamping boron steel sheets, with cutting speed and their interactions having the most influencing effects. Particularly, interactions can have an opposite behavior for different levels of the process parameters...|$|E
40|$|Fiber laser for {{materials}} processing have undergone a rapid {{development in the}} pastseveral years. As fiber laser provides a combination of high beam quality and awavelength that is easily absorbed by metal surfaces, the named future laser isexpected to challenge the CO 2 and Nd:YAG lasers {{in the area of}} metal cutting. This thesis studied the performance of fiber laser cutting mild steel. In the literature review part, it introduced the laser cutting principle and the principle of fiber laser including the newest development of fiber laser cuttingtechnology. Because the fiber laser cutting mild steel is a very young technology, a preliminary test was made in order to investigate effect of the cutting parameters on cut quality. Then the formal fiber laser cutting experiment was madeby using 3 mm thickness S 355 steel with oxygen as assistant gas. The experimentwas focused on the cut quality with maximum cutting speed and minimum oxygen gas pressure. And the cut quality is mainly decided by the kerf width, <b>perpendicularity</b> <b>tolerance,</b> surface roughness and striation patterns. After analysis the cutting result, several conclusions were made. Although the best result got in the experiment is not perfect as predicted, the whole result of the test can be accepted. Compared with CO 2 laser, a higher cutting speed was achieved by fiber laser with very low oxygen gas pressure. A further improvement about the cutting quality might be possible by proper selection of process parameters. And in order to investigate the cutting performance more clearly, a future study about cutting different thickness mild steel and different shape was recommended...|$|E
