50|$|A {{swashplate}} {{controls the}} collective and cyclic <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the main <b>blades.</b> The swashplate moves up and down, {{along the main}} shaft, to change the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> both <b>blades.</b> This causes the helicopter to push air downward or upward, depending on the angle of attack. The swashplate can also change its angle to move the blades angle forwards or backwards, or left and right, to make the helicopter move in those directions.|$|R
50|$|In May 1959, {{propeller}} pitch-lock mechanisms, {{designed to}} arrest the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blades</b> and prevent them from opening further when an overspeed is imminent, became mandatory on U.S. piston-engined transport aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Improved {{stability}} {{was provided}} in a hingeless helicopter rotor by inclining the principal elastic flexural axes and coupling <b>pitching</b> <b>of</b> the rotor <b>blade</b> with the lead-lag bending <b>of</b> the <b>blade.</b> The primary elastic flex axes were inclined by constructing the <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> materials that display non-uniform stiffness, and the specification described various cross section distributions {{and the resulting}} inclined flex axes. Arrangements for varying the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the rotor <b>blade</b> in a predetermined relationship with lead-lag bending <b>of</b> the <b>blade,</b> i. e., bending <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> in a plane parallel to its plane of rotation were constructed...|$|R
5000|$|Instead {{of using}} a moving {{electromagnet}} (voice coil) placed {{within the field of}} a stationary permanent magnet to drive a cone, like a conventional subwoofer, on a rotary woofer, the voice coil's motion is used to change the angle of a fixed rotation speed set <b>of</b> fan <b>blades</b> in order to generate sound pressure waves. The <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blades</b> change according to the signal the amplifier supplies, producing a modulated sound wave due to the air moved by the spinning blades. If there is no signal applied, the blades simply rotate [...] "flat" [...] at zero pitch, producing no sound. Since the audio amplifier only changes the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blades,</b> it takes much less power to drive a rotary woofer, although a secondary power source is required to drive the fan motor.|$|R
5000|$|In aircraft, {{blade pitch}} is usually {{described}} as [...] "coarse" [...] {{for a greater}} horizontal blade angle, and [...] "fine" [...] for a more vertical blade angle. For an aircraft that is stationary the angle <b>of</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> each <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> a propeller fitted to that aircraft equates to the angle of attack.|$|R

2500|$|The {{cyclic control}} {{was found to}} be {{difficult}} to perfect, and led to Sikorsky locking the cyclic and adding two smaller vertical-axis lifting rotors to either side aft of the tailboom. By varying <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> these rotors simultaneously, fore and aft control was provided. [...] Roll control was provided by differential <b>pitching</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blades.</b> [...] In this configuration, {{it was found that the}} VS-300 could not fly forward easily and Sikorsky joked about turning the pilot's seat around.|$|R
50|$|A rotary woofer is a subwoofer-style {{loudspeaker}} which reproduces {{very low}} frequency content by using a conventional speaker voice coil's motion to change the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> a set <b>of</b> fan <b>blades</b> rotating at a constant speed. The <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the fan <b>blades</b> {{is controlled by the}} audio signal presented to the voice coil, and is able to swing both positive and negative, with respect to a zero pitch spinning blade position. Since the audio amplifier only changes the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blades,</b> it takes much less power, per dB of generated acoustic sound level, to drive a rotary woofer than to power a conventional subwoofer, which uses a moving electromagnet (voice coil) placed within the field of a stationary permanent magnet to drive a cone which then displaces air. Rotary woofers excel at producing sounds below 20 Hz, below the normal hearing range; when installed in the wall of a sealed room, they can produce audio frequencies down to zero Hz, a static pressure differential, by simply compressing the air in the sealed room.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{solution is to}} fit a variable pitch fan. Scheduling the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the fan <b>blades</b> has no impact upon {{the position of the}} fan working lines, but can be used to move the surge line upwards, to improve fan surge margin.|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{following}} Ref. [22], the blade imbalance was simulated by scaling the mass density <b>of</b> one <b>blade,</b> which creates an uneven distribution of mass {{with respect to the}} rotor. In addition, the aerodynamic asymmetry was simulated by adjusting the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> one <b>blade,</b> which creates an uneven torque across the rotor. In our paper, the blade imbalance is due to icing on the blade. Therefore, the imbalance <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> is considered around 20 % as uncertainty. We have designed a robust control to control the turbine in the presence of uncertainty due to the blade imbalance icing.|$|R
40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are controlled}} through the electrical torque on the generator and the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blades.</b> The tuning <b>of</b> the controller determines {{the dynamics of}} the system, which can then be good (smooth yet responsive) or bad (ineffective or unstable).

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides an}} improvement for a wind turbine (20) having {{at least one}} blade (21) mounted on a hub (22) for controlled rotation about a blade axis (yb-yb) to vary the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blade</b> relative to an airstream. The hub is mounted on a nacelle (23) for rotation about a hub axis (xh-xh). The wind turbine includes a main pitch control system for selectively controlling the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blade,</b> and/or a safety pitch control system for overriding the main blade pitch control system and for causing the blade to move toward a feathered position {{in the event of}} an overspeed or fault condition. The improvement includes: an energy storage device (26) mounted on the nacelle and associated with the blade; a pitch-axis controller (25) mounted on the nacelle and associated with the blade and with the energy storage device; an electro-mechanical actuator (28) mounted on the hub and associated with the blade; and at least one slip ring (29) operatively arranged to transmit power and/or data signals between the pitch-axis controller and the electro-mechanical actuator; whereby the mass on the rotating hub may be reduced...|$|R

Variable pitch is investigated and certain areas of operation are discerned where varying the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blades</b> can provide optimal performance with respect to both torque ripple and power output...|$|R
40|$|Since the popularization <b>of</b> the {{controllable}} <b>pitch</b> propellers among small-sized {{and medium-sized}} ships, the optimum combination to minimize oil {{consumption of the}} rate of rotation of engine (rpm) and the angular <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> propeller <b>blades</b> at various cruising speeds has been an interest of marine engineers. We {{made a series of}} experiments to find the optimum combination with the training ship Kakuyo-Maru (1, 044. 38 G/T, 2, 800 HP) under various cruising speeds of 9 ～ 13. 5 knots on October 22 nd 1983 in the northwestern Pacific. Following results were obtained. i) Cruising speed, V (knot) and consumption of fuel oil, Gm (kg/n. m. running) were expressed by the following experimental formulae, where n is rpm of the main engine; S, slip ratio of propeller; θp, angular <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> propeller <b>blades.</b> V= 0. 0241 n- 0. 15863 S+ 0. 84685 ・θp- 12. 4791 Gm= 0. 04906 ・n- 0. 0086 ・V²+ 0. 52406 S- 0. 06734 ・θp- 11. 91674 ii) The oil consumption was always smaller at the combination of lower rpm and greater pitch within the speed tested.

50|$|The project employs 660 kW {{capacity}} Vestas wind turbines, which collectively {{will produce}} a maximum electrical output of 306.9 MW. (The current operating capacity is 122.8 MW.) On average, the project is expected to produce 30 to 35 percent of that capacity year-round. Turbines are controlled individually by electronic systems which direct them into the wind and adjust the <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>blades</b> to maximize electrical production at any wind speed from 7 to 56 mph.

5000|$|Radio-controlled helicopters, {{although}} often grouped with RC aircraft, {{are in a}} {{class of}} their own because of the vast differences in construction, aerodynamics and flight training.

40|$|Control {{systems for}} {{underwater}} vehicles {{have reached the}} level of sophistication where they are limited by the dynamic performance of the thrust actuators. Standard fixed-pitch propellers {{have been shown to}} have very poor dynamic characteristics, particularly at low thrust levels The dynamic response of a fixed-pitch propeller is dependent upon highly non-linear transients encountered while the shaft speed approaches its steady-state value. This thesis proposes the use <b>of</b> a controllable <b>pitch</b> propeller system to address this problem. A controllable pitch propeller varies the amount of thrust produced by varying the <b>pitch</b> angle <b>of</b> the <b>blades</b> at a constant shaft speed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation of the power input <b>of</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impellers and standard Rushton turbine impellers in a cylindrical vessel provided with four radial baffles at its wall under a turbulent regime of flow of an agitated liquid. The influence of the geometry <b>of</b> the <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impellers (<b>pitch</b> angle, number <b>of</b> <b>blades)</b> and the off-bottom impeller clearance of both high-speed impellers tested on the impeller power input is determined in two sizes of the cylindrical vessel (0. 3 m and 0. 8 m diameter of vessel). A strain gauge torquemeter is used in the small vessel and a phase shift mechanical torquemeter is used in the large vessel. All results of the experiments correspond to the condition that the Reynolds number modified for the impeller exceeds ten thousand. The results of this study show that the significant influence of the separating disk thickness of the turbine impeller corresponds fairly well to the empirical equations presented in the literature. Both the influence of the number <b>of</b> impeller <b>blades</b> and the <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> angle <b>of</b> the <b>pitched</b> <b>blade</b> impeller were expressed quantitatively by means of the power dependence of the recently published correlations: the higher the pitch angle and the number <b>of</b> <b>blades,</b> the higher the values of the impeller power input.
