Simulations can be used to determine the best type of thermoforming process for a given product, develop the optimum geometry of a <b>plug</b> <b>assist,</b> and determine the resulting material distribution to be used in a structural analysis of a product.

40|$|During thermoforming, the {{moulding}} {{of parts}} with high draw depth and stretch ratio, respectively, is allowed {{by means of}} using mechanical prestretching aids. This so-called <b>plug</b> <b>assist</b> is responsible for pushing more raw material into the cavity {{before the start of}} the final moulding using difference in air pressure. Besides the velocity of the <b>plug</b> <b>assist</b> and the temperature of the plastic sheet, the friction coefficient between plug and sheet plays the most important role in wall thickness distribution of the final part.

40|$|Purpose: This work {{investigates the}} use of the {{underwater}} explosion (UNDEX) for the free and <b>plug</b> <b>assisted</b> cup forming processes. Design/methodology/approach: A 3 D finite element model is built to simulate the process of the UNDEX cup forming using ABAQUS finite element code. Johnson-Cook (JC) material plasticity model is used to represent strain rate sensitivity of the used materials. Johnson- Cook damage criterion is employed to detect the onset of damage in the cup forming process. Findings: Both relatively hard and soft plugs are considered and the effects of using different plug materials on cup profile, strains and the limiting drawing ratios are given. The onset of damage in this process is also indicated. The results suggest that a relatively hard plug can enhance the control of the cup shape and the uniformity of strain distribution leading to increased limiting drawing ratio. Research limitations/implications: This work suggests a methodology for the prediction of shape, different strain distribution, the limiting drawing ratio and the energy required for UNDEX cup forming process. Practical implications: This study could be useful in non-conventional high energy rate forming industry. Originality/value: The study reveals the possibility of producing flat-bottomed cup by the relatively hard <b>plug</b> <b>assisted</b> UNDEX forming technique...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermoforming}} {{process is}} only one of the many manufacturing methods that converts plastic material into numerous products. As with many thermoforming companies the process is not used to its full potential. The major goal of this work was to develop a non-isothermal simulation of the <b>plug</b> <b>assisted</b> thermoforming process which has direct practical relevance with the thermoforming industry. The simulation would be used as design tool to help improve the process, enabling investigations into changes in product/tooling design and processing conditions, prior to production. Development of robust and accurate simulations has been difficult due to the interactions that exist between the key process elements, such as; highly non-linear material response, heat transfer and friction. For these reasons a fUlly coupled non-isothermal simulation of the <b>plug</b> <b>assisted</b> thermoforming process does not exist. To reduce the scope of this work a previously developed constitutive material model capable of predicting the deformation response of the material used in this work was adopted therefore allowing for more simulation and experimental investigations... A detailed experimental programme was carried out on a single shot experimental thermoforming machine to investigate the effect of the major thermoforming processing variables such as plug speed, sheet temperature etc. In addition a series of friction and heat transfer experiments were conducted using specially adapted test equipment in an attempt to isolate and understand each contact phenomena better. The information obtained from the experiments was used in the construction and validation of the developed simulation which was carried out using the finite element package ABAQUSÃ‚Â®/Standard. Initial isothermal simulations were used to investigate the effects of friction only on the simulated output. The simulation capabilities were improved by incorporating heat transfer effects and a fully coupled temperature dependant simulation is presented. The peiiormance of the simulation was validated against the experimental data obtained from the thermoforming trials and the trends observed were highly comparable. The overall project goals were met with the development of a working nonisothermal simulation incorporating all aspects of the <b>plug</b> <b>assisted</b> thermoforming process such as heat transfer and friction, however further work is required on the constitutive material modelling aspects of the work to improve the simulation capabilities.

40|$|A common {{misconception}} in the thermoforming {{community is}} that, prior to conducting a thermoforming simulation, significant material testing must be completed {{to develop a}} complex visco-elastic material model. Published research reports over the last twenty years, as well as work {{by the author of}} this white paper, show that {{for the vast majority of}} thermoformable polymers a very simple hyperelastic (rubber-like) material model will work sufficiently well. Spending considerable time and expense on experimental work to develop a visco-elastic material model for a polymer, while not incorrect, is usually unnecessary. Background: Thermoforming Using Vacuum or Pressure (Not Plug Assisted) With just a few exceptions, thermoformable polymers will exhibit similar material behavior during the forming process, if they are uniformly heated to within their forming temperature window. Nearly all of the thermoformable polymers will stretch and thin in a very similar manner. As a result, different polymers will produce nearly identical material distributions, if the thermoforming process uses only vacuum and or pressure (not plug assisted). (Note: how to efficiently deal with the simulation of plug assisted thermoforming is covered in another white paper entitled “Optimizing the <b>Plug</b> <b>Assist</b> Geometr...|$|E
40|$|A single {{cylinder}} vertical air-cooled diesel engine was modified to use LPG in dual fuel mode {{to study the}} performance, emission, and combustion characteristics. The primary fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), was mixed with air, compressed, and ignited by a small pilot spray of diesel. Dual fuel engine showed a reduction in oxides of Nitrogen and smoke in the entire load range. However, it suffers from the problem of poor brake thermal efficiency and high hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions, particularly at lower loads due to poor ignition. In order to improve the performance at lower loads, a glow plug was introduced inside the combustion chamber. The brake thermal efficiency improved by 3 % in the glow <b>plug</b> <b>assisted</b> dual fuel mode, especially at low load, and also reduced the hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and smoke emissions by 69 %, 50 % & 9 % respectively.

50|$|An {{integral}} part of the thermoforming process is the tooling which is specific to each part that is to be produced. Thin-gauge thermoforming as described above is almost always performed on in-line machines and typically requires molds, <b>plug</b> <b>assists,</b> pressure boxes and all mounting plates as well as the trim tooling and stacker parts that pertain to the job. Thick or heavy-gauge thermoforming also requires tooling specific to each part, but because the part size can be very large, the molds can be cast aluminum or some other composite material as well as machined aluminum as in thin gauge. Typically thick-gauge parts must be trimmed on CNC routers or hand trimmed using saws or hand routers. Even the most sophisticated thermoforming machine is limited {{to the quality of the}} tooling. Some large thermoforming manufacturers choose to have design and tool making facilities in house while others will rely on outside tool-making shops to build the tooling.|$|R
40|$|An acid-free {{strategy}} shows high flexibility for tuning {{the structural}} properties of Al-SBA- 15 mesoporous materials. Full-open-, plug-containing- and inkbottle-type mesostructures have been directly hydrothermally synthesized by simply adjusting the P 123 /Si molar {{ratio of the}} initial reaction mixture from 0. 015 to 0. 0020. When attaching a plug precursor addition process (denoted as <b>Plug</b> Precursor <b>Assisted</b> Synthesis, PPAS), the plug structure can be controllably generated inside the straight mesopores of the resulting Al-SBA- 15. The plug-containing Al-SBA- 15 sample showed that more than 43 % of the mesopores were blocked by the plug structures, even with a P 123 /Si molar ratio condition of as high as 0. 0075. More importantly, it exhibited stronger acid strength than an Al-SBA- 15 sample possessing full-open-type mesopores, and was characterized by the strongest acidity with a pH value of around 2. The strong acid strength was due to aluminum migration and rearrangement, {{as well as to}} structural reconstruction during the hydrothermal treatment to form plugs, which also accelerated the generation of more tetrahedral-coordinated Al species with high accessibility. In contrast, a plug-containing Al-SBA- 15 sample synthesized from an HCl aqueous medium has a relatively lower aluminum content and a weaker acid strength, although the pH value was measured to be ca. 2. To account for this result, negatively charged silica fragments are suggested to have been previously neutralized by H+ so that further interaction with Al 3 + was suppressed. Therefore, the inclusion of aluminum into framework reconstruction in the subsequent hydrothermal treatment under an H+-rich synthesis condition was inhibited. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Plug {{temperature}} {{is a key}} parameter affecting the thickness distribution of thermoplastic components made by <b>plug</b> <b>assist</b> thermoforming. For a specified pair of plug and plastic sheet, the variation in plug temperature can alter the coefficient of friction (COF) between the pair. We show here how the temperature dependence of COF influences {{the nature and extent}} of biaxial stretching of the sheet and consequently the thickness distribution of the thermoformed component. In the present study, high impact polystyrene (HIPS) sheets were thermoformed into axisymmetric cups using a plug-assist process in which the aluminum plug temperature (T-plug) was varied from ambient to above the glass transition temperature of HIPS (similar to 100 degrees C). Biaxial strain maps on the surfaces of the formed cups were measured and quantified using Grid Strain Analysis (GSA). Thickness distributions of the cups were also measured. Temperature dependent COF between HIPS and aluminum was determined independently using a rotational rheometer. The measured COF was low for T 100 degrees C, a significant reduction in the magnitude of slip is expected. Here the sheet is gripped at the clamp and by the plug during forming which causes reduced biaxial stretching of the base and increased uniaxial stretching of the walls of the cup. Simulations of plug-assist thermoforming using a temperature dependent COF showed qualitative agreement with the GSA data thereby supporting our inferences...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{a summary of}} the results of Phase 1 of this contract. The {{objective}} was to evaluate the potential of assist technologies for direct-injected alternative fuel engines vs. glow <b>plug</b> ignition <b>assist.</b> The goal was to demonstrate the feasibility of an ignition system life of 10, 000 hours and a system cost of less than 50 % of the glow plug system, while meeting or exceeding the engine thermal efficiency obtained with the glow plug system. There were three tasks in Phase 1. Under Task 1, a comprehensive review of feasible ignition options for DING engines was completed. The most promising options are: (1) AC and the ''SmartFire'' spark, which are both long-duration, low-power (LDLP) spark systems; (2) the short-duration, high-power (SDHP) spark system; (3) the micropilot injection ignition; and (4) the stratified charge plasma ignition. Efforts concentrated on investigating the AC spark, SmartFire spark, and short-duration/high-power spark systems. Using proprietary pricing information, the authors predicted that the commercial costs for the AC spark, the short-duration/high-power spark and SmartFire spark systems will be comparable (if not less) to the glow plug system. Task 2 involved designing and performing bench tests to determine the criteria for the ignition system and the prototype spark plug for Task 3. The two most important design criteria are the high voltage output requirement of the ignition system and the minimum electrical insulation requirement for the spark plug. Under Task 3, all the necessary hardware for the one-cylinder engine test was designed. The hardware includes modified 3126 cylinder heads, specially designed prototype spark plugs, ignition system electronics, and parts for the system installation. Two 3126 cylinder heads and the SmartFire ignition system were procured, and testing will begin in Phase 2 of this subcontract...|$|R
