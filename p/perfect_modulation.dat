Electron emission is studied {{as a function of}} pulse delay, optical near-field intensities, DC bias field, and final photoelectron energy. Under optimized conditions modulation amplitudes of the electron emission of 97. 5 % are achieved. Experimental observations are discussed in the framework of quantum- pathway interference supported by local density of states (LDOS) simulations. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

30|$|The {{assumption}} of <b>perfect</b> balance of <b>modulation</b> is the first-order approximation we make to obtain average gains of the network. Here we numerically check how far this assumption {{is from the}} result of our simulations. To answer this question, we investigate tuning of different components of the input to neurons in a network. We reconstruct the input from excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic sources by replacing each spike with the synaptic kernel (alpha function) and adding all the contributions to obtain a shot-noise signal. We then compute the mean value of this signal as the mean presynaptic excitation and inhibition, respectively.|$|R
30|$|Note {{that the}} Shannon bounds {{inherently}} assume a <b>perfect</b> selection of <b>modulation</b> and coding schemes. However in the uplink, due to fluctuating interference, this selection {{can not be}} perfect by definition, even not in static channel conditions. Furthermore imperfect channel estimation will also degrade the performance. The consequence is a loss of some dBs. On the other hand, the base stations typically have 2 receive antennas, which is also not considered in the Shannon bounds which {{will lead to a}} gain in the range of 3 [*]dB. Furthermore, frequency selective scheduling (e.g., though proportional fair scheduling) will lead to multi-user diversity gain [18, 19].|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a secrecy sum-rate {{maximization}} based matching algorithm between primary transmitters and secondary cooperative jammers {{in the presence}} of an eavesdropper. More explicitly, we consider an untrusted relay scenario, where the relay is a potential eavesdropper. We first show the achievable secrecy regions employing a friendly jammer in a cooperative scenario with employing an untrusted relay. Then, we provide results for the secrecy regions for two scenarios, where in the first case we consider no direct transmission between the source and the destination, while in the second case we include a source to destination direct link in our communication system. Furthermore, a friendly jammer helps to send a noise signal during {{the first phase of the}} cooperative transmission, for securing the information transmitted from the source. In our matching algorithm, the selected cooperative jammer or the secondary user, is rewarded with the spectrum allocation for a fraction of time slot from the source which is the primary user. The Conventional Distributed Algorithm (CDA) and the Pragmatic Distributed Algorithm (PDA), which were originally designed for maximising the user’s sum rate, are modified and adapted for maximizing the secrecy sum-rate for the primary user. Instead of assuming <b>perfect</b> <b>modulation</b> and/or perfect channel coding, we have also investigated our proposed schemes when practical channel coding and modulation schemes are invoked...|$|E
40|$|A {{recent study}} by the authors points to Charged Particle Drag (CPD) as a {{contributor}} to revisit in the LAGEOS non-gravitational perturbations problem. Such perturbations must account for dynamical contributions in the order of pms− 2. The simulated effect takes into account: (i) spatial and temporal variations of the plasmatic parameters (temperature and concentration of the species), (ii) spacecraft potential variations caused by both the eclipse passages and variations in the parameters mentioned above, and (iii) solar and geomagnetic conditions. Furthermore, recent theoretical improvements concerning scattering drag overcome previous limitations allowing for a complete formulation of this effect. For each satellite the lifetime CPD instantaneous acceleration is computed. The plasmatic parameters have been obtained fromthe Sheffield Coupled Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Plasmasphere (SCTIP) semi-empirical model (up to the polar region), as well as alytical/empirical approximations based on spacecraft measurements for the auroral and polar regions. Results show that maximum amplitudes for LAGEOSI are larger than those for LAGEOS-II: − 85 pms− 2 and − 70 pms− 2 respectively. This is due to the almost (magnetically) polar orbit configuration of the first, producing larger combinations of plasmatic parameter values. High solar activity has a huge impact in the resulting LAGEOS accelerations: it yields a <b>perfect</b> <b>modulation</b> of the resulting acceleration with maximum amplitudes up to a factor of 10 when comparing low and high activity periods. On the other hand, the impact of the geomagnetic activity results into a reduction of the effect itself, probably due to a decrease in the hydrogen concentration for high energy input periods. The acceleration results will be used in a refined orbit computation in a subsequent investigation...|$|E
40|$|Most {{terahertz}} metasurfaces utilise metallic resonators {{for various}} functions ranging from filtering, polarisation conversion, <b>modulation,</b> <b>perfect</b> absorption, to beamforming. Here {{we show that}} silicon can replace metals to build resonators for similar functions with superior performance. In one case, moderately doped silicon is shown to support terahertz surface plasmon polaritons. Resonant cavities built from this lightly conductive silicon support low-Q resonance, and can greatly absorb terahertz waves with an enhanced bandwidth. In another case, intrinsic silicon with low absorption is used to create dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs). These DRAs arranged in a reflectarray configuration can impose arbitrary phase responses to reflected waves for high-efficiency beam manipulation. Owing to the designable properties of silicon, we envisage numerous future applications of silicon-based terahertz resonators.

40|$|Spin {{precession}} due to Rashba spin-orbit {{coupling in}} a two-dimension electron gas {{is the basis}} for the spin field effect transistor, in which the overall <b>perfect</b> spin-polarized current <b>modulation</b> could be acquired. There is a prerequisite, however, that a strong transverse confinement potential should be imposed on the electron gas or the width of the confined quantum well must be narrow. We propose relieving this rather strict limitation by applying an external magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the electron gas because the effect of the magnetic field on the conductance of the system is equivalent to the enhancement of the lateral confining potential. Our results show that the applied magnetic field has little effect on the spin precession length or period although in this case Rashba spin-orbit coupling could lead to a Zeeman-type spin splitting of the energy band.

40|$|The {{growing demand}} for {{processing}} and compression of still two-dimensional (2 -D) images and video signals in telecommunications and multimedia technology motivates the fact that increasingly more attention is being paid to multidimensional (M-D) digital systems. As usual the transformation part of encoding system is performed by some multirate systems. The main interest in this paper is connected with so-called true M-D systems, namely with nonseparable multirate systems with even support. 1. MD MULTIRATE SYSTEMS Multirate systems consist of M-D digital filters, decima-tors, interpolators and delay elements [1]. They form anal-ysis and synthesis filter banks (FB). The decimation ma-trix plays {{a very important role}} in it. Every known proce-dure for M-D multirate system design is based on a given decimation matrix [1, 2, 3, 4].

40|$|Well-crystallized macromolecules melt irreversibly due to {{the need}} of {{molecular}} nucleation, while small molecules melt reversibly as long as crystal nuclei are present to assist crystallization. Furthermore, imperfect crystals of low-molar-mass polymers may have a sufficiently small region of metastability between crystallization and melting to show a reversing heat-flow component due to melting of poor crystals followed by crystallization of imperfect crystals which have insufficient time to <b>perfect</b> before the <b>modulation</b> switches to heating and melts the imperfect crystals. Many metals, in turn. melt sharply and reversibly as long as nuclei remain after melting for subsequent crystallization during the cooling cycle. Their analysis is complicated, however, {{due to the}}rmal conductivity limitations of the calorimeters. Polymers of sufficiently high molar mass, finally, show {{a small amount of}} reversible. local melting that may be linked to partial melting of individual molecules. Experiments by temperature-modulated calorimetry and model calculations are presented. The samples measured included poly(ethylene terephthalate) s, poly(ethylene oxide) s, and indium. Two unsolved problems that arose from this research involve the origin of a high, seemingly stable, reversible heat capacity of polymers in the melting region, and a smoothing of melting and crystallization into a close-to-elliptical Lissajous figure in a heat-flow versus sample-temperature plot...|$|R
40|$|Selectivity for {{temporal}} sequences {{is important}} for several visual functions and {{can be explained by}} feed-forward mechanisms that combine signals with different temporal delays in a multiplicative or AND-like fashion. Temporal sequence selectivity can also be achieved by recurrent neural networks with asymmetric lateral connections. The dynamics of such recurrent direction-selective neural networks are tractable in the spatial continuum limit. A second important visual function is gain modulation. ``Gain fields‘‘ might play an important role for the implementation of coordinate transformations in the visual cortex. Also, gain control might play a critical role for the realization of attentional modulation which is multiplicative in different cortical areas, e. g. areas V 4 and MT. Again, such modulation could be accomplished by mechanisms, like shunting inhibition, that are inherent to individual neurons. Salinas and Abott have shown that, alternatively, multiplicative gain modulation can also be realized by recurrent linear threshold networks with symmetric lateral couplings, which do not contain multiplying neural elements. By quantitative simulations we show that a simple recurrent linear threshold network with asymmetric connections is highly speed-selective, and accomplishes almost <b>perfect</b> multiplicative gain <b>modulation</b> controlled by an additive biasing input. We present also an analytical solution for the nonlinear network dynamics that proves the existence of a stable stimulus-locked pulse travelling pulse solution within a limited regime of stimulus speeds which depends only weakly on the biasing input...|$|R
40|$|The term “metamaterials” {{refers to}} {{engineered}} structures that interact with electromagnetic fields {{in an unusual}} but controllable way that cannot be observed with natural materials. Metamaterial design at optical frequencies oftentimes makes of controllable plasmonic interactions. Light can excite collective oscillations of conduction band electrons on a metallic nanostructure. These oscillations result in localized surface plasmon modes which can provide high confinement of fields at metal-dielectric interfaces at nanoscale. Additionally scattering and absorption characteristics of plasmon modes can be controlled by geometrical features of the metallic nanostructures. This ease of controllability has {{lead to the development}} of new concepts in light manipulation and enhancement of light-material interactions. Fano resonance and plasmonic induced transparency (PIT) are among the most promising of those. The interference between different plasmon modes induced on nanostructures generates PIT/Fano resonance at optical frequencies. The unusual dispersion characteristics observed within the PIT window can be used for designing optical metamaterials to be used in various applications including bio-chemical sensing, slow light, <b>modulation,</b> <b>perfect</b> absorption, and all-optical switching. This thesis focuses on design of novel plasmonic devices to be used in these applications. The fundamental idea behind these designs is the generation of higher-order plasmon modes, which leads to PIT/Fano resonance-like output characteristics. These are then exploited together with dynamic tunability supported by graphene and field enhancement provided by nonlinear materials to prototype novel plasmonic devices. More specifically, this thesis proposes the following plasmonic device designs. I. 	Nano-disk Fano resonator: Open disk-like plasmonic nanostructures are preferred for bio-chemical sensing because of their higher capacity to be in contact with greater volumes of analyte. High effective refractive index required by sensing applications is achieved though the dispersion characteristics within PIT window. Higher order modes required for Fano resonance are generated through geometrical symmetry breaking by embedding a shifted and elongated cavity into a circular disk. The resulting dual band PIT can be geometrically tuned by varying the cavity's width and rotation angle. II. 	Tunable Terahertz Fano resonator: The possibility to dynamically tune graphene's conductivity has made it an attractive choice over conventional noble metals to generate surface plasmon modes at Terahertz frequencies. Subsequently, a polarization-independent and dynamically tunable hybrid gold-graphene structure is designed to achieve PIT/Fano resonance by allowing graphene and metallic plasmon modes to interfere. The effective group index of the resulting resonator is found to be very high (ng= 1400, several times higher than all previously reported PIT devices) within the PIT window. Dynamic tunability achieved through a gate voltage applied to graphene suggests applications in switching. III. 	Tunable Terahertz Fano absorber: Many photonic and optical devices rely on their ability to efficiently absorb an incoming electromagnetic field. The absorption in atomically thin graphene sheet is already very high i. e., “ 2. 3 %” per layer. However, considering its atomic thickness graphene sheet remains practically transparent to Terahertz waves. The proposed absorber design makes of an asymmetrically patterned graphene layer that supports higher order plasmon modes at Terahertz frequencies. Several of these patterned layers backed by dielectric substrates are stacked {{on top of each other}} followed by reflector screen. The dynamically controllable resonances from each graphene layer and the spacing between them are fine tuned to achieve a large bandwidth of 6. 9 Terahertz (from 4. 7 to 11. 6 Terahertz) for over 90 % absorption, which is significantly higher than that of existing metallic/graphene absorbers. IV. 	Three state all-optical switch: The plasmonic resonances are extremely sensitive to dielectric properties of the surrounding medium. A slight change in the dielectric constant near the metal surface results in a significant change in the plasmonic resonance. This sensitivity is enhanced in the presence of a nonlinear change in the dielectric constant. To make use of this effect, Fano resonator is used in conjunction with a Kerr nonlinear material. The resulting resonator exploits multiple (higher order) surface plasmons to generate a multi-band tri-stable response in its output. This cannot be obtained using existing nonlinear plasmonic devices that make use of single mode Lorentzian resonances. Multi-band three-state optical switching that can be realized using the proposed resonator has potential applications in optical communications and computing...|$|R
