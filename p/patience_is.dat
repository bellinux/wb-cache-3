5|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player defends their client and cross-examines the witnesses. They can {{move back and}} forth between the statements in each testimony; if they find a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads to changes in the testimony. A life bar, representing the judge's <b>patience,</b> <b>is</b> shown in the upper right corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying to break psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the life bar gets restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{debate on}} this issue is still fresh; neither side can claim to know for certain which {{strategies}} will ultimately be effective in defeating non-state combatants. Opponents of the invasion strategy point {{to a lack of}} examples in which occupying or peacekeeping forces have met with conclusive success. They also cite continuing conflicts such as Northern Ireland, Israel, Chechnya, and Iraq, as well as examples which they claim ultimately proved to be failures, such as Lebanon, and Afghanistan. Supporters of the invasion strategy hold that {{it is too soon to}} call those situations failures, and that <b>patience</b> <b>is</b> needed to see the plan through. Some say that the invasions themselves have, in fact, been successful, but that political opponents and the international media skew the facts for sensationalism or political gain.|$|E
500|$|Zero <b>Patience</b> <b>is</b> a 1993 Canadian musical film {{written and}} {{directed}} by John Greyson. The film examines and refutes the urban legend of the alleged introduction of HIV to North America by a single individual, Gaëtan Dugas. Dugas, better known as Patient Zero, was tagged in the popular imagination with the blame in large measure because of Randy Shilts's history of {{the early days of the}} AIDS epidemic, And the Band Played On (1987). The film tells its story against the backdrop of a romance between a time-displaced Sir Richard Francis Burton and the ghost of [...] "Zero" [...] (the character is not identified by Dugas' name).|$|E
500|$|In the {{courtroom}} trials, the player aims {{to get their}} client declared [...] "not guilty". To do so, they cross-examine witnesses, and aim to find lies and inconsistencies in the testimonies. They are {{able to go back}} and forth between the different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a piece of evidence that contradicts the statement. The player is penalized if they present incorrect evidence: in the first game, a number of exclamation marks is shown, with one disappearing after each mistake the player makes; in later games, a health bar that represents the judge's <b>patience</b> <b>is</b> used instead. If all exclamation marks are lost, or the health bar reaches zero, the player loses the game and their client is declared guilty.|$|E

500|$|Notices {{were posted}} on churches forbidding worship services, and priests who objected were arrested. Buses were stopped and their {{passengers}} searched by armed troops. The Winnipeg Tribune was renamed Das Winnipeger Lügenblatt ("The Winnipeg Lies-sheet"), a 'Nazi' publication featuring heavily censored columns and a front page written almost entirely in German. One satirical story noted that [...] "this {{is a great}} day for Manitoba...The Nazis, like Der Fuehrer, are patient, kind and tolerant, but THEIR <b>PATIENCE</b> <b>IS</b> RAPIDLY EXHAUSTED BECOMING", while another included an [...] "official joke", approved by the German authorities, at which all readers were ordered to laugh or be imprisoned. Henry Weppler, a newspaper seller for the Winnipeg Free Press, was attacked and his papers ripped up. The Winnipeg Free Press featured a front-page story about the [...] "invasion", describing in great detail the devastation caused by the Nazis in Winnipeg.|$|E
500|$|Those Sullivan wrote himself {{include the}} {{overture}}s to Thespis, Iolanthe, Princess Ida, The Yeomen of the Guard, The Gondoliers and The Grand Duke. Sullivan's authorship of the overture to Utopia, Limited cannot be verified with certainty, as his autograph score is now lost, {{but it is}} likely attributable to him, as it consists {{of only a few}} bars of introduction, followed by a straight copy of music heard elsewhere in the opera (the Drawing Room scene). Thespis is now lost, but {{there is no doubt that}} Sullivan wrote its overture. Very early performances of The Sorcerer used a section of Sullivan's incidental music to Shakespeare's Henry the VIII, as he did not have time to write a new overture, but this was replaced in 1884 by one executed by Hamilton Clarke. [...] Of those remaining, the overtures to H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance are by Alfred Cellier, the overture to <b>Patience</b> <b>is</b> by Eugene d'Albert, and those to The Mikado and Ruddigore are by Hamilton Clarke (although the Ruddigore overture was later replaced by one written by Geoffrey Toye).|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} synopsis establishes back-story that is {{not seen}} or referenced {{in the beginning of}} the film, stating that Mrs. Gage turned to her only son for support after losing the last of her savings. Seeking his support, Mrs. Gage arrives at his house and is shown in by her granddaughter, Marie. The son welcomes his mother, but his wife strongly objects to having her mother-in-law take up residence in the house. Shown to her room by Marie, Mrs. Gage makes herself comfortable and gives Marie a kitten. [...] "Granny" [...] quickly becomes friends with little Marie. The wife struggles with Granny's presence, but her <b>patience</b> <b>is</b> tested when Granny knocks over a vase, and in recoiling, knocks over a sewing box. The mother delivers an ultimatum to her husband, [...] "Either your mother or I must leave this house!" [...] Though not shown, the husband decides that his mother is to go. In the next scene, the wife appears and informs her that she must leave. Marie assists her grandmother before her departure to the old folks' home with her son. She is upset that her grandmother was made to leave because she was [...] "only in the way" [...] and that as a cripple, she is no different. Marie writes a letter explaining that she has gone to live with grandma and departs to the old folks' home. Marie's journey with the kitten in one arm and her crutch in the other is a difficult one. On the way, she stumbles and loses her crutch in a brook, but she limps onward. Her parents search frantically for Marie and discover the note. The parents head to the old folks' home and are relieved to find Marie with her grandmother. The wife then informs the nurse that Granny will be leaving. After packing her belongings, the family depart.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cinematography}} by Mikhail Krichman received great {{praise from}} most critics. Its slow pace and long running time divided critics, having {{been described as}} [...] "at times a painfully slow film" [...] and [...] "it slips gently by, holding the attention in an iron grip." [...] Anton Bitel said [...] "the viewer's <b>patience</b> <b>is</b> rewarded with exquisite painterly images, some unexpectedly rapid developments and a truly bleak vision of human error and its consequences." ...|$|E
2500|$|Seeking to {{curb the}} {{influence}} of Davis, Wittpenn announced his candidacy for Governor, stating [...] "I have endured the machine as long as possible, but <b>patience</b> <b>is</b> no longer a virtue." [...] Davis, in turn, prevailed upon Woodrow Wilson, then President of Princeton University, to oppose Wittpenn's candidacy. Wilson's victory was overwhelming even in Hague's ward, despite heavy-handed tactics used there. The Jersey Journal wrote: [...] "Cops on duty were using clubs and blackjacks to assist Mayor Wittpenn and Frank Hague defeat the Davis men." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to his essay, [...] "Practicing Patience: How Christians Should Be Sick", in Christians Among the Virtues, he {{said that}} Christians are called to be patient {{patients}} in sickness and in health because [...] "patience is integral to the Christian life". Patience cannot be first learned while being a patient. To learn patience, Christians are to exercise the virtue through deeds, truth, practice, and living it. Hauerwas also says that <b>patience</b> <b>is</b> a virtue {{we have in common}} with God. [...] "In Him, patience has its beginning, and from Him as its source it takes its splendor and dignity." [...] He also says that God showed us the best example of patience {{when it comes to the}} life of Jesus. Because God is the foundation, Hauerwas stated that “only patience shaped by Christ is true patience". As well as this, he later emphasized that <b>patience</b> <b>is</b> not developed by human will, but given through the Holy Spirit, who gives us the capacity to love, for “without [...] in us there cannot be patience because in good men it is the [...] of God which endures all things.” In the author’s essay, he gave people a framework of how to learn to practice patience when we are not sick: ...|$|E

25|$|According to Gilbert's biographer Edith Browne, {{the title}} character, <b>Patience,</b> <b>was</b> made up and costumed to {{resemble}} {{the subject of a}} Luke Fildes painting. <b>Patience</b> <b>was</b> not the first satire of the aesthetic movement played by Richard D'Oyly Carte's company at the Opera Comique. Grossmith himself had written a sketch in 1876 called Cups and Saucers that was revived as a companion piece to H.M.S. Pinafore in 1878, which was a satire of the blue pottery craze.|$|R
2500|$|Lucy's husband, Ricky Ricardo, is an up-and-coming Cuban American {{singer and}} bandleader with an excitable personality. His <b>patience</b> <b>is</b> {{frequently}} tested by his wife's antics. When exasperated, he often reverts to speaking rapidly in Spanish. As with Lucy, not much is revealed {{about his past}} or family. Ricky's mother (played by actress Mary Emery) appears in two episodes; in another Lucy mentions that he has five brothers. Ricky also mentions {{that he had been}} [...] "practically raised" [...] by his uncle Alberto (who was seen during a family visit to Cuba), and that he had attended the University of Havana.|$|E
2500|$|European naturalists studied crickets {{since the}} 18th century. William Gould {{described}} feeding ant nymphs to a captive mole cricket for several months. The European approach to cricket breeding has been popularized by Jean-Henri Fabre. Fabre wrote that breeding [...] "demands no particular preparations. A little <b>patience</b> <b>is</b> enough." [...] According to Fabre, home breeding may start {{as early as}} April or May with the capture {{of a couple of}} field crickets. They are placed in a flower pot with [...] "a layer of beaten earth" [...] inside, and a tightly fitting lid. Fed only with lettuce, Fabre's cricket couple laid five to six hundred eggs, and practically all of them hatched.|$|E

2500|$|In 1945, Sills {{made her}} {{professional}} stage debut with a Gilbert and Sullivan touring company produced by Jacob J. Shubert, playing twelve {{cities in the}} US and Canada, in seven different Gilbert and Sullivan operas. In her 1987 autobiography, she credits that tour with helping to develop the comic timing she soon became famous for: [...] "I played the title role in Patience, and I absolutely loved the character, because <b>Patience</b> <b>is</b> a very funny, flaky girl. ... I played her as a dumb Dora {{all the way through}} and really had fun with the role. ... My Patience grew clumsier and clumsier with each performance, and audiences seemed to like her. ... I found that I had a gift for slapstick humor, and it was fun to exercise it onstage." [...] Sills sang in light operas for several more years.|$|E
2500|$|... "Hence our clemency {{perceives}} {{the need}} of keeping watch over the pagans and their heathen enormities, since by natural depravity and stubborn lawlessness, they forsake the path of true religion.

Not the thousand terrors of laws already promulgated nor the penalty of exile pronounced upon them deter these men, whereby, if they cannot reform, at least they might learn to abstain from their mass of their crimes and the multitude of their sacrifices. But their insane audacity transgresses continually; our <b>patience</b> <b>is</b> exhausted by their wicked behavior so that if we desired to forget them, we could not disregard them." ...|$|E

Now I don't think anybody can say that—at least without inflicting damage on the constitution". To seek to offer advice to the Queen whilst unable to feel they could command a majority in the Commons was [...] "tantamount to treating the monarch herself with disrespect and denying the very principle in which our parliamentary democracy is founded". After Major's challenger, John Redwood, was defeated, Powell wrote to him, [...] "Dear Redwood, you will never regret {{the events of the last}} week or two.
