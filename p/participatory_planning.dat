Previous discussions suggest that <b>participatory</b> urban <b>planning</b> may help to understand structural inequalities, to gain, even if temporally, institutional support and to deliver a planning process in constant negotiation with local actors. Building upon an action research project which implemented a process of <b>participatory</b> urban <b>planning</b> for climate change in Maputo, Mozambique, this paper reflects upon the practical lessons that emerged from these experiences, {{in relation to the}} incorporation of climate change information, the difficulties to secure continued support from local governments and the opportunities for local impacts through the implementation of the proposals emerging from this process...|$|R

The objectives would be promotion of the voluntary substitution of crops, poverty reduction, productive opportunities for the cultivators, sustainable development, strengthened communities and strengthening the presence of the State. In cases where no agreement with the community is reached, the State would proceed with the eradication of illicit crops, prioritizing manual eradication wherever possible.|$|E

40|$|<b>Participatory</b> Spatial <b>Planning</b> is a {{collaborative}} governance practice in which different stakeholders, from different organizational levels {{are involved in}} {{a collaborative}} decision-making process. Capturing deliberation along collaborative decision-making processes is a challenging task. Several stakeholders deliberate in different moments, trying to accomplish different tasks, collaborating and communicating with different people and working in different environments. Knowledge derived from parallel processes, driven and interpreted by different actors, needs to be captured, managed and shared in order to make decision-making transparent, shared and accepted by the local communities. Communication technology and multimedia offer novel way to face the problem of knowledge representation and management. In this demo we present research results of a tool integration project to design and implement a tool-kit to capture deliberation in <b>Participatory</b> Spatial <b>Planning</b> Practices.

40|$|AbstractBased on Habermas' Theory of Communicative Action, {{this paper}} critiques the {{transparency}} and legitimacy of <b>participatory</b> scenario <b>planning,</b> considering {{a case study}} of scenario development for the livestock industry within Scotland. The paper considers {{the extent to which the}} case study approximates the conditions for ‘ideal speech situations’ and how these conditions could be applied more widely in <b>participatory</b> scenario <b>planning.</b> The authors explore the rationale for <b>participatory</b> scenario <b>planning</b> within the science–policy interface with critical reference to the corporate context in which scenario planning has evolved. The aim is to optimise the potential for its use in the context of socio-technical and environmental governance. Researcher co-reflections on the case study are mapped within a matrix of indices representing conditions for ideal speech situations. Further analytical categories highlight the extent to which ideal speech was approximated. Although many of the constraints on achieving ideal speech situations reflect intransigent, practical logistics of organising participatory exercises, our novel approach enables the systematic identification of some important issues and provides a conceptual framework for understanding how they interrelate that may prove useful to practitioners and theorists alike...|$|R

Freire’s belief that poor and exploited people can, and should be, enabled to analyze their own reality was a fundamental inspiration for the <b>participatory</b> <b>planning</b> movement. Lewin’s relevance lay in his integration of democratic leadership, group dynamics, experiential learning, action research, and open systems theory, and his efforts to overcome racial and ethnic injustices.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, <b>participatory</b> {{watershed}} <b>planning</b> {{and development}} is a vital necessity in complex landscapes. Interactions between and within communities depend on what happens {{at different levels of}} the watershed. Watershed planning has moved away from conventional land-use planning exercise to a logical interpretation of the potentials of the land {{as a function of the}} needs, demands and aspirations of the people living in the watersheds, including the interactions between people’s activities and the land resources. <b>Participatory</b> watershed <b>planning</b> is thus the key to understand what is needed to be done at various levels to sustain, improve, and diversify production while developing and managing the natural resource-base, promote income generation opportunities, increase access to basic services (roads, markets, schools, water, and the like), and make livelihood systems resilient to shocks.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} and analyze three case studies within {{different}} ecological contexts and land uses, {{each of which}} use participatory approaches to draw out stakeholders' preferences and perceptions and to involve stakeholders in the decision-making process. The case studies are the following: (1) <b>participatory</b> scenario <b>planning</b> for a protected area in Doñana coastal wetland in Southwestern Spain; (2) assessment of ecosystem services trade-offs in a rubber agroforest landscape in Jambi, Indonesia; and (3) assessment of ecosystem services using a visual-stimulus approach in the transhumance cultural landscapes of Central Spain. Our main objective is to compare and contrast several participatory approaches used in environmental assessments {{in order to assess}} their main advantages and limitations. The specific objectives of this study are as follows: (1) to describe the application, in different contexts, of several participatory methods, namely <b>participatory</b> scenario <b>planning,</b> <b>participatory</b> ecosystem service assessment of trade-offs, and participatory evaluation of ecosystem services through visual preferences; (2) to evaluate the extent to which ecological aspects as articulated by stakeholders were assessed by each method; and (3) to assess the different value conceptions captured by each methodology and how this might influence overall results.|$|R
