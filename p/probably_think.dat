I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they <b>probably</b> <b>think</b> I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
500|$|On Selection Sunday, Temple Owls {{received}} a seven seed and {{was due to}} face Penn State in the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament on March 17 at the McKale Center in Tucson, Arizona. The two teams had played {{each other in a}} scrimmage in the preseason. They had also met in the 2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament when the Owls earned an 84–72 victory in the Sweet Sixteen. Coming into the game, Fran Dunphy had a NCAA tournament record 11-game losing streak, at Penn and Temple Owls. [...] "I <b>probably</b> <b>think</b> about it less than others do," [...] said Dunphy, [...] "but you think about it. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But I'm so thrilled for these kids and so thrilled to be in the tournament. We've had a nice run – this particular group, four straight years of going to the NCAA tournament is pretty special." ...|$|E

Gerstmann wrote: [...] "When I {{reflect on the}} experience, I'll <b>probably</b> <b>think</b> about the times the game locked up on me or broke in a dozen other crazy ways first, before thinking about the great world and the objectives that fill it. If {{you were able to}} look past the issues that plagued Fallout 3 and Oblivion before it, New Vegas will eventually show you a real good time." [...] 1UP.com's Mike Nelson wrote [...] "On one hand, it feels like I can recommend this to any fan of the Fallout series. I single these fans out because they're willing to forgive silly bugs like meeting characters who walk into walls or occasionally float in mid-air. These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical anomalies. [...] On the other hand, I simply can't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me when I walk around the Mojave Wasteland; or for quests that simply can't be completed because of a game glitch; or for making my companions disappear when I need them the most during a battle. These {{are some of the most}} frustrating bugs I have ever encountered with any game, especially when attached to a series that I deeply enjoy." ...|$|E

2500|$|The series drew some renewed media {{attention}} in 2011, when Aaron Sorkin announced {{that his new}} 2012 series, set in the newsroom of a cable news channel and originally to be titled More As This Story Develops, would be renamed The Newsroom. Writing in Maclean's, Jaime Weinman said the choice of name was [...] "a bit of a grimly amusing reminder that the U.S. TV industry doesn't take Canada very seriously... 'The Newsroom' is often considered the greatest show Canada has ever produced, but a U.S. network feels no need to fear unflattering comparisons: assuming they’ve heard of the show, they <b>probably</b> <b>think</b> {{most people in the}} States have not heard of it." [...] In an interview with The Daily Beast following the Sorkin show's premiere, Finkleman revealed that HBO did contact him for permission to reuse the title, which he granted as he had no further plans to revive his series.|$|E
2500|$|On November 10, 1961, she {{received}} a Doctor Honoris Causa in Historical Sciences by Moscow State University for her contributions {{to the development of}} Marxist theory. In her acceptance speech she asserted that class struggle is the motor of history. In 1962 she attended the 10th Congress of the Italian Communist Party held December 2–8 in Rome where she met Socialists, Christian-Democrats and some church representatives. To the clerics she remarked, [...] "We are not as wicked as you think, and we are not as good as we <b>probably</b> <b>think</b> we are." [...] During {{the first few months of}} 1963 Ibárruri unsuccessfully appealed for the Spanish government to spare the life of executive committee member Julián Grimau. Before his execution Grimau wrote to Ibárruri saying, [...] "My execution will be the last one." [...] On the week of May 13 Ibárruri unveiled a plaque in his honour on Building 11, Block 1, of newly renamed Grimau Street in Moscow. On December 5 she arrived in Havana to commemorate the 5th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. [...] Cuban leader Fidel Castro invited Ibárruri to move permanently to the island, but she declined.|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{adapting the}} Boris Pasternak novel for television, screenwriter Andrew Davies revealed {{the task was}} [...] "daunting because the book is reckoned to be a masterpiece and the film is a great movie and one that I admire very much. Robert Bolt is the king of epic screenplay writers in my book. But as I got further into the book I kept thinking that I didn't agree with Robert Bolt about how to tell the story... and I began to feel much more excited." [...] He added, [...] "It was also a relief to find {{so much in the}} book that hadn't found its way into the first movie and could make great drama.... I thought the film does the spectacle really well. Rather surprisingly, it also explains the politics very well, but I thought it could do a better job on the relationships. It's probably a bit controversial, but I thought we could say more about Lara and Yuri and how they get together; about Lara's extraordinary situation {{at the beginning of the}} story and Yuri having a dreadful start to his life with his parents dying. None of these things really came out in the movie, but they are there in the book. I think that if they look at both versions now, people will <b>probably</b> <b>think</b> that this version in a lot of ways works better for our time. It's more contemporary. I think they'll find the performances are more subtle yet speak to us in our time. Maybe my script will seem out of date in 20 years time because a lot of them do, but watching the original film, I think the central performances look stilted and dated now." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film {{received}} extensive negative reviews at {{the time}} of its release and by modern film historians. Variety was particularly negative. Calling the movie [...] "derivative", the industry trade publication said, [...] "Summarizing the plot of Beginning of the End is like rehashing the story of several dozen similar films." [...] The publication felt that not much effort had been put into the film. [...] "Even taken on its own terms—as a low-budget exploitation feature—Beginning of the End hardly reflects the best effort of a major theatre circuit." [...] It called the special effects [...] "obvious" [...] and decried the use of stock footage. The reviewer felt the screenplay was [...] "ludicrous" [...] and cliché-ridden. The magazine believed Peter Graves had turned in a decent performance, but described Peggie Castle's performance as [...] "unconvincing" [...] and Morris Ankrum's as [...] "artificial". The cinematography and editing were, it concluded, average. Mae Tinnee, reviewing the motion picture for the Chicago Tribune had several negative comments. [...] "The film obviously was made on a shoestring budget, and the people in it are no more than props for the magnified insects. I doubt if it will fool anyone. But youngsters will <b>probably</b> <b>think</b> it's great stuff." [...] The Los Angeles Times was far harsher in its assessment. Its unsigned review concluded: [...] "The audience is cheated in the production. The conclusion is never in doubt and the process shots are so obvious that one is startled the first time a buffalo-sized grasshopper hits the screen but never again. And at no time are there more than a half-dozen of the things shown at once, although the script avers that there are thousands about and more coming." [...] As of 2008, Beginning of the End is still [...] "one of the most excoriated creature features." [...] Leonard Maltin summed up his review in one word: [...] "awful". Another recent film guide called it [...] "Bottom-of-the-sci-fi-barrel rubbish, very boring to watch." [...] One review pointed out that Gordon didn't even bother to hide the mountains in the background of the shots (Central Illinois is mostly flat prairie land). Some have also been upset with film's lack of horrifying images. The derivative nature of the picture has also upset some critics. Critics say the film covered almost the same ground as the far superior monster movie Them!, and it is clear that Gordon merely wanted to [...] "cash in" [...] on giant bug craze rather than come up with a story that was fresh and creative.|$|E
