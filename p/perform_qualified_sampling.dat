50|$|As a first step, an {{electronic}} nose {{needs to be}} trained with <b>qualified</b> <b>samples</b> so as to build a database of reference.

This however may also provide a problem as many odours {{are made up of}} multiple different molecules, this may be possibly wrongly interpreted by the device as it will register them as different compounds, resulting in incorrect or inaccurate results depending on the primary function of a nose.|$|R
