40|$|The {{problem of}} {{selecting}} the correct subset of predictors within a linear model has received much attention in recent literature. Within the Bayesian framework, a popular choice of prior has been Zellner’s g-prior {{which is based}} on the inverse of empirical covariance matrix of the predictors. An extension of the Zellner’s prior is proposed in this article which allow for a <b>power</b> <b>parameter</b> on the empirical covariance of the predictors. The <b>power</b> <b>parameter</b> helps control the degree to which correlated predictors are smoothed towards or away from one another. In addition, the empirical covariance of the predictors is used to obtain suitable priors over model space. In this manner, the <b>power</b> <b>parameter</b> also helps to determine whether models containing highly collinear predictors are preferred or avoided. The proposed <b>power</b> <b>parameter</b> can be chosen via an empirical Bayes method which leads to a data adaptive choice of prior. Simulation studies and a real data example are presented to show how the <b>power</b> <b>parameter</b> is well determined from the degree of cross-correlation within predictors. The proposed modification compares favorably to the standard use of Zellner’s prior and an intrinsic prior in these examples...|$|E

We hypothesized that dynamic and non-dynamic cardiac <b>power</b> <b>parameters</b> would track hypovolemia better than equivalent flow- and pressure parameters, both during spontaneous breathing and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). Methods Fourteen healthy volunteers underwent lower body negative pressure (LBNP) of 0, − 20, − 40, − 60 and − 80 mmHg to simulate hypovolemia, both during spontaneous breathing and during NPPV. We recorded aortic flow using suprasternal ultrasound Doppler and blood pressure using Finometer, and calculated dynamic and non-dynamic <b>parameters</b> of cardiac <b>power,</b> flow and blood pressure. These were assessed on their association with LBNP-levels. Results Respiratory variation in peak aortic flow was the dynamic parameter most affected during spontaneous breathing increasing 103 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) from baseline to LBNP − 80 mmHg. Respiratory variation in pulse pressure was the most affected dynamic parameter during NPPV, increasing 119 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) from baseline to LBNP − 80 mmHg. The cardiac power integral was the most affected non-dynamic parameter falling 59 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) from baseline to LBNP − 80 mmHg during spontaneous breathing, and 68 % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) during NPPV.

40|$|Using {{the power}} kernels of Phillips, Sun and Jin (2006, 2007), {{we examine the}} large sample {{asymptotic}} properties of the t-test for different choices of <b>power</b> <b>parameter</b> (rho). We show that the nonstandard fixed-rho limit distributions of the t-statistic provide more accurate approximations to the finite sample distributions than the conventional large-rho limit distribution. We prove that the second-order corrected critical value based on an asymptotic expansion of the nonstandard limit distribution is also second-order correct under the large-rho asymptotics. As a further contribution, we propose a new practical procedure for selecting the test-optimal <b>power</b> <b>parameter</b> that addresses the central concern of hypothesis testing: the selected <b>power</b> <b>parameter</b> is test-optimal {{in the sense that}} it minimizes the type II error while controlling for the type I error. A plug-in procedure for implementing the test-optimal <b>power</b> <b>parameter</b> is suggested. Simulations indicate that the new test is as accurate in size as the nonstandard test of Kiefer and Vogelsang (2002 a, 2002 b; KV), and yet it does not incur the power loss that often hurts the performance of the latter test. The new test therefore combines the advantages of the KV test and the standard (MSE optimal) HAC test while avoiding their main disadvantages (power loss and size distortion, respectively). The results complement recent work by Sun, Phillips and Jin (2008) on conventional and bT HAC testing.
