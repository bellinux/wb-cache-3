5|$|Prior to 2007, the Staten Island Railway used Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color <b>position</b> <b>light</b> {{signals that}} dated {{back to when}} it was a B line. In 2007, a $72 million project to replace the old signal system was completed. The system was {{replaced}} with an FRA-compliant 100Hz, track circuit based, Automatic Train Control (ATC) signal system. As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC bi-directional movement. A new rail control center and back-up control center was constructed as part of this contract.|$|E

25|$|Today's LIRR {{signal system}} {{has evolved from}} its legacy Pennsylvania Railroad-based system. The {{railroad}} utilizes a variety of wayside railroad signals including <b>position</b> <b>light,</b> color light and dwarf signals. In addition, much of the LIRR {{is equipped with a}} bi-directional Pulse code cab signaling called automatic speed control (ASC), though portions of the railway still retain single direction wayside only signalling. Unlike other railroads which began using color light signals in the 20th century, the LIRR did not begin using signals with color lights on its above ground sections until 2006. Some portions of the railway lack automatic signals and cab signals completely, instead train and track car movements are governed only by timetable and verbal/written train orders.|$|E

30|$|Even though {{driving into}} sidings/the depot is a {{frequent}} task for drivers working shifts around rush hours, it {{does not account for}} a significant percentage of their shift. Hence, when the large percentage of all category A SPaDs and the low percentage of the shift spent in these locations are considered, this suggests that there are issues {{in the design of the}} locations and operational procedures. The signalling is the main difference at the depot and the sidings compared to the rest of the network with the majority of the signals being ground <b>position</b> <b>lights.</b> Even though the majority of the drivers disagree with added complexity of those locations and ground <b>position</b> <b>lights,</b> they gave this type of signals the lowest mark. Moreover, participants’ involvement in category A SPaDs does not influence the attitudes of the drivers towards the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> (U =  28, p =  0.663). The respondents mention that the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> are hard to see at times due to low brightness and a poor choice of location. It is possible that the drivers do not see any hazard in this type of signalling in the context of day-to-day driving. However, when compared with different types of signals, they perceive the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> as the hardest to interact with. It is also possible that the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> are the hardest to interact with in the beginning of a shift before driving in passenger service.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, the PRR experimented {{installing}} red lenses in {{the horizontal}} {{position of the}} upper head to help increase the at distance visibility of absolute Stop signals at Overbrook interlocking. Under the Penn Central and later Conrail it became standard practice to add these red lenses to high <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> and even some pedestal signals. The Norfolk and Western modified its signals to use red and green lenses in the upper head Stop and Clear positions and yellow lenses everywhere else. In the 1980s Amtrak modified most of its former-PRR <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> to use the equivalent color light colors {{in all of the}} positions of both heads. Internally referred to as <b>position</b> color <b>lights,</b> these are {{not to be confused with}} color <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> described below, which while functionally similar are structurally considerably different.|$|R

2500|$|Since Conrail {{acquired}} many separate railways, and the North American railway {{signalling system}} is not standardized, operators needed to qualify on {{as many as seven}} different signalling systems. The varying systems include, but are not limited to, the PRR <b>position</b> <b>light</b> signals, the NYC searchlight signals and tri-light signals, and the EL tri-light signals. The NYC tri-light was adopted as Conrail's systemwide standard for new signal installations. Most of the existing technologies were defined by the Northeast Operating Rules Advisory Committee (NORAC). Conrail had its own, unique tri-light signal modernization program that was applied to many routes. Today, most Northeastern railroads associated with former Conrail assets are working towards standardization of all systems as vertical color light signals. Meanwhile, Amtrak uses {{a modified version of the}} PRR <b>position</b> <b>light</b> signals called [...] "Position Color Lights".|$|E

2500|$|This {{station has}} one 12-car-long {{high-level}} side platform, {{north of the}} track. The Port Jefferson Branch has one track at this location. Directly before the station and lasting until the track runs adjacent to Bellrose Avenue School, a passing siding spurs off from the mainline and runs adjacent to it. The switches are maintained by two <b>position</b> <b>light</b> signals next to the switches. Just east of the station is a siding that is well in use, part of [...] Just east of Larkfield Road, the siding turns south and runs parallel to the main. The siding is used on occasion for train meets, where an eastbound and westbound trains to pass. The second track would eliminate this. DUKE interlocking ends at a switch back to the main.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1850, the Western Literary Messenger wrote: [...] "While Martensen {{with his}} wealth of genius casts from his central <b>position</b> <b>light</b> upon every sphere of existence, upon all the {{phenomena}} of life, Søren Kierkegaard stands like another Simon Stylites, upon his solitary column, with his eye unchangeably fixed upon one point." [...] In 1855, the Danish National Church published his obituary. Kierkegaard {{did have an}} impact there judging from the following quote from their article: [...] "The fatal fruits which Dr. Kierkegaard show to arise from the union of Church and State, have strengthened the scruples {{of many of the}} believing laity, who now feel that they can remain no longer in the Church, because thereby they are in communion with unbelievers, for there is no ecclesiastical discipline." ...|$|E

50|$|A <b>{{position}}</b> <b>light</b> {{signal is}} one where {{the position of the}} lights, rather than their colour, determines the meaning. The aspect consists solely of a pattern of illuminated lights, which are all of the same colour (typically a lemon yellow colour on mast signals with a frosted white on the dwarfs in U.S. service, colour having been added on the N&W, now Norfolk Southern's, position lights). In many countries, small <b>position</b> <b>light</b> signals are used as shunting signals, while the main signals are of colour light form. Also, many tramway systems (such as the Metro of Wolverhampton) use <b>position</b> <b>light</b> signals.|$|E
5000|$|A {{standard}} high <b>position</b> <b>light</b> {{consists of}} two heads; the bottom head can remain dark unless it is needed. In addition to the high <b>position</b> <b>light</b> signals the PRR developed a dwarf <b>position</b> <b>light,</b> as with many railroads, these dwarf signals are {{also referred to as}} a [...] "pot," [...] a tradition carried over from the 19th century revolving [...] "Pot Type Signal." [...] Four plain white lamps are able to display four low-speed aspects each with two lamps. In 1930, close clearances of the Philadelphia Suburban Station complex spurred development of the pedestal-type position, which consisted of two position dwarf signals in a common cast backing.|$|E

40|$|Chloroplasts {{change their}} {{positions}} in the cell depending on the light conditions. In the dark, chloroplasts in fern prothallia locate along the anticlinal wall (dark position). However, chloroplasts become relocated to the periclinal wall (<b>light</b> <b>position)</b> when the <b>light</b> shines perpendicularly to the prothallia. Red light is effective in inducing this relocation in Adiantum capillus-veneris, and neochrome 1 (neo 1) {{has been identified as}} the red light receptor regulating this movement. Nevertheless, we found here that chloroplasts in neo 1 mutants still become relocated from the dark <b>position</b> to the <b>light</b> <b>position</b> under red <b>light.</b> We tested four neo 1 mutant alleles (neo 1 - 1, neo 1 - 2, neo 1 - 3, and neo 1 - 4), and all of them showed the red-light-induced chloroplast relocation. Furthermore, chloroplast <b>light</b> <b>positioning</b> under red <b>light</b> occurred also in Pteris vittata, another fern species naturally lacking the neo 1 -dependent phenomenon. The <b>light</b> <b>positioning</b> of chloroplasts occurred independently of the direction of red light, a response different to that of the neo 1 -dependent movement. Photosynthesis inhibitors 3 -(3, 4 dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea or 2, 5 -dibromo- 3 -isopropyl- 6 -methyl-p-benzoquinone blocked this movement. Addition of sucrose (Suc) or glucose to the culture medium induced migration of the chloroplasts to the periclinal wall in darkness. Furthermore, Suc could override the effects of 3 -(3, 4 dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea. Interestingly, the same <b>light</b> <b>positioning</b> was evident for nuclei under red light in the neo 1 mutant. The nuclear <b>light</b> <b>positioning</b> was also induced in darkness with the addition of Suc or glucose. These results indicate that photosynthesis-dependent nondirectional movement contributes to the <b>light</b> <b>positioning</b> of these organelles in addition to the neo 1 -dependent directional movement toward light...|$|R
