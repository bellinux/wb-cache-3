40|$|Abstract. <b>Probucol,</b> a lipid-lowering {{agent with}} {{anti-oxidant}} properties, {{is involved in}} protection against atheroscle-rosis, while cilostazol, an antiplatelet agent, has diverse neuroprotective properties. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of <b>probucol</b> and cilostazol on focal cerebral ischemia with hypercholesterolemia. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout (KO) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without 0. 3 % <b>probucol</b> and/or 0. 2 % cilostazol for 10 weeks. To assess the protective effects of the combined therapy of <b>probucol</b> and cilostazol on isch-emic injury, the mice received 40 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Infarct volumes, neurobehavioral deficits and neuroinflammatory mediators were subsequently evaluated 48 h after reperfusion. <b>Probucol</b> alone and <b>probucol</b> plus cilostazol significantly decreased total- and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol in ApoE KO with HFD. MCAO resulted in significantly larger infarct volumes in ApoE KO mice provided with HFD compared to those fed a regular diet, although these volumes were significantly reduced in the <b>probucol</b> plus cilostazol group. Consistent with a smaller infarct size, <b>probucol</b> alone and the combined treatment of <b>probucol</b> and cilostazol improved neurological and motor func-tion. In addition, <b>probucol</b> alone and <b>probucol</b> plus cilostazol decreased MCP- 1 expression and CD 11 b and GFAP immuno-reactivity in the ischemic cortex. These findings suggested that the inhibitory effects of <b>probucol</b> plus cilostazol in MCP- 1 expression in the ischemic brain with hypercholesterolemia allowed the identification {{of one of the}} mechanisms respon-sible for anti-inflammatory action. <b>Probucol</b> plus cilostazol may therefore serve as a therapeutic strategy for reducing the impact of stroke in hypercholesterolemic subjects...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{modification}} of low density lipoprotein (LDL) renders it more atherogenic. <b>Probucol,</b> a highly nonpolar antioxidant, is transported in lipoproteins, including LDL, and inhibits oxidative {{modification of}} LDL in vitro. The ability of <b>probucol</b> to inhibit atherogenesis in the LDL receptor-deficient rabbit has {{been attributed to}} its antioxidant effect. We report synthesis of a new water-soluble analogue of <b>probucol</b> that is very effective in preventing cell-induced LDL oxidation. The polar <b>probucol</b> derivative, diglutaryl <b>probucol,</b> is efficiently taken up by endothelial cells and macrophages in culture and is hydrolyzed to release the active antioxidant, <b>probucol.</b> The treated cells, after thorough washing, show a marked decrease in their capacity to oxidize LDL during a subsequent incubation. At high concentrations of the derivative, the cells also released free <b>probucol</b> into the medium.

40|$|Background—The role of hepatic ATP-binding {{cassette}} transporter 1 (ABCA 1) {{in maintaining}} plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels is well established, but {{its role in}} reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is unclear. <b>Probucol</b> {{is a compound that}} reduces HDL-C levels but also reduces atherosclerosis in animal models and xanthomas in humans. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test the hypothesis that <b>probucol</b> inhibits hepatic ABCA 1 activity, thereby reducing HDL-C levels but promoting RCT from macrophages. Methods and Results—Wild-type (WT) C 57 BL/ 6 mice and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) knockout mice were fed a chow diet containing 0. 5 % <b>probucol</b> or normal chow for 2 weeks. In WT mice, <b>probucol,</b> despite decreasing HDL-C by 80 %, effectively maintained macrophage RCT. In SR-BI knockout mice, <b>probucol</b> also substantially reduced HDL-C but significantly increased macrophage RCT. Furthermore, <b>probucol</b> significantly enhanced the excretion of HDL-derived cholesterol into feces in both WT and SR-BI knockout mice. <b>Probucol</b> inhibited ABCA 1 -dependent cholesterol efflux from mouse primary hepatocytes, and this effect was shown to be responsible for the effect of <b>probucol</b> on increasing the fecal excretion of HDL-derived cholesterol in vivo. Conclusions—We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of hepatic ABCA 1 activity with <b>probucol</b> reduced HDL-C levels but promoted RCT through diversion of HDL-derived cholesterol from efflux back into plasma instead to excretion in the bile.

The <b>Probucol</b> Angioplasty Restenosis Trial was a prospective, randomized, {{controlled}} {{study that}} investigated {{the effectiveness of}} <b>probucol</b> therapy in reducing the rate of restenosis after {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA). Background. Antioxidants have an inhibitory effect on smooth muscle cell growth in experiments in vitro and in vivo, which suggests a possible pharmacologic effect on restenosis after PTCA. Methods. One hundred one patients were randomly assigned to receive 1, 000 mg/day of <b>probucol</b> or control (no lipid-lowering) therapy 4 weeks before PTCA. After 4 weeks of premedication, both groups underwent PTCA. <b>Probucol</b> was continued until follow-up angiography 24 weeks after PTCA.

Dilation was successful in 46 of 50 patients in the <b>probucol</b> group and 45 of 51 in the control group. At follow-up angiography 24 weeks after angioplasty, angiographic restenosis occurred in 9 (23 %) of 40 patients in the <b>probucol</b> group and 22 (58 %) of 38 in the control group (p = 0. 001). Minimal lumen diameter was 1. 49 ± 0. 75 mm (mean ± SD) in the <b>probucol</b> group and 1. 13 ± 0. 65 mm in the control group (p = 0. 02). Percent diameter stenosis at follow-up angiography in the <b>probucol</b> group was significantly lower than that in the control group (43. 9 % vs. 56. 4 %, p = 0. 009). The late loss was 0. 37 ± 0. 69 mm in the <b>probucol</b> group and 0. 60 ± 0. 62 mm in the control group (p = 0. 13).

40|$|Abstract <b>Probucol</b> is a {{powerful}} inhibitor of atherosclerosis {{in a number of}} animal models. However, it is unknown whether {{this is due to the}} strong antioxidant protection of low density lipoprotein (LDL), to antioxidant effects in the artery wall, or to cellular effects not shared by other antioxidants. To investigate whether murine models are suitable to study the antiatherogenic mechanisms of <b>probucol,</b> three experiments following different protocols were carried out in 135 male and female LDL receptor-deficient (LDLR�/�) mice. Treatment groups received a high (0. 5 %) or low (0. 025 %) dose of <b>probucol,</b> or low-dose <b>probucol</b> plus a high dose (0. 1 %) of vitamin E for periods ranging from 6 to 26 weeks. In all experiments, <b>probucol</b> strongly protected LDL against ex vivo oxidation (lag times exceeding 1400 min in 0. 5 % probucol-treated mice). Treatment with 0. 5 % <b>probucol</b> significantly lowered both HDL-cholesterol and plasma apolipoprotein (apo) A-I concentrations. In all three experiments, treatment with 0. 5 % <b>probucol</b> consistently increased the size of lesions in the aortic origin, from 1. 3 -fold (n. s.) to 2. 9 -fold (P � 0. 05) in female mice and from 3. 6 - to 3. 7 -fold in males (P � 0. 001). Even treatment with 0. 025 % <b>probucol</b> increased atherosclerosis 1. 6 -fold in male mice (P � 0. 01). Addition of the high dose of vitamin E did not attenuate the pro-atherogenic effect of 0. 025 % <b>probucol.</b> In conclusion, <b>probucol</b> not only failed to decrease but actively increased atherogenesis in LDLR�/ � mice in a dosedependent manner, even though it provided a very strong antioxidant protection of LDL. This suggests that the reduction of atherosclerosis observed in other animal models is due to intracellular effects of <b>probucol</b> not found in mice, to differences in the metabolism of <b>probucol,</b> and/or to an overriding atherogenic effect of the decrease in HD...|$|E
40|$|Antioxidants can inhibit atherosclerosis, but it {{is unclear}} how {{inhibition}} of intimal lipid oxidation relates to atherogenesis. Here we tested the effect of <b>probucol</b> and its metabolite bisphenol on aortic lipid (per) oxidation and atherogenesis in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits. LDL and aortas from rabbits fed <b>probucol</b> contained bisphenol at concentrations comparable to those in bisphenol-treated animals. Bisphenol treatment increased plasma cholesterol slightly, and plasma and aortic α-tocopherol more substantially; these parameters were unaffected by <b>probucol.</b> Bisphenol and <b>probucol</b> treatment both enhanced the resistance of circulating LDL to peroxyl radical–induced lipid peroxidation; this was due to bisphenol, not <b>probucol.</b> Only <b>probucol</b> enhanced LDL’s resistance to Cu 2 +-induced oxidation. Both bisphenol and <b>probucol</b> treatment strongly inhibited aortic accumulation of hydroperoxides and hydroxides of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides [LO(O) H]. Despite this, however, <b>probucol</b> had a modestly significant effect on the extent of lesion formation; bisphenol had no inhibitory effect. In addition, the extent of atherosclerosis did not correlate with amounts of aortic LO(O) H present, but, as expected, it did correlate with aortic α-tocopherol and cholesterol. Together, these results suggest that aortic accumulation of LO(O) H is not required for, nor is α-tocopherol depleted during, the initiation and progression of atherogenesis in WHHL rabbits...|$|E

40|$|Background: Artemisinin-based {{combination}} therapy (ACT) {{has been adopted}} as national policy for the first-line treatment in large number of malaria-endemic regions. However, artemisinin-resistant parasites have emerged and are spreading, with slow-cleaning parasites being reported in patients treated with ACT.

Therefore, {{the development of a new}} method to enhance the effect of artemisinin is required. In this study, the potential effect of <b>probucol</b> as a combination drug of dihydroartemisinin (DHA), an artemisinin derivative, was examined. Methods: C 57 BL/ 6 J mice infected with Plasmodium yoelii XL- 17 were treated with <b>probucol</b> and/or DHA. The mice were fed with a <b>probucol</b> mixed diet from 2 weeks before infection and through infection period. DHA was injected to mice three to 5 days post infection once a day. In addition, 0. 5 % (w/w) <b>probucol</b> was mixed with vitamin E supplemented diet (800 mg/kg) and fed to mice infected with P. yoelii XL- 17 to examine the mechanisms of <b>probucol</b> on murine malaria. Furthermore, 8 -OHdG, a biomarker of oxidized DNA, was detected in infected red blood cells (iRBC) taken from infected mice by immunofluorescent staining. Results: With dose-dependent manner, both <b>probucol</b> and DHA decreased parasitaemia and increased survival rate of mice infected with P. yoelii XL- 17. A significantly larger amount of 8 -OHdG was detected in iRBC taking from probucol-treated mice than control mice. In addition, a large amount of vitamin E supplementation eliminated the effect of <b>probucol</b> against P. yoelii XL- 17 infection and lowered the effect of <b>probucol</b> on host plasma vitamin E concentration. The effective doses for <b>probucol</b> and DHA were 0. 5 % and 30 mg/kg, respectively, in each single treatment. While the combination treatment of 0. 25 % <b>probucol</b> and 7. 5 mg/kg DHA was effective in all mice from P. yoelii XL- 17 infection. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that <b>probucol</b> has some impact on malaria by oxidative stress through the induction of host plasma vitamin E deficiency.

However, some studies suggest that <b>probucol</b> may also have neurovascular benefits. <b>Probucol</b> was found to prevent cognitive and hippocampal synap-tic impairments induced by amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides in mice [1] and in a pilot clinical study in subjects with early-mid Alzheimer’s disease (AD), <b>probucol</b> was re-ported to stabilize cognitive decline compared to the placebo treated group [2]. The mechanisms for the pur-ported positive effects of <b>probucol</b> in AD and in models of AD are unknown but are suggested to include de-creased formation of toxic Aβ oligomers as a conse-quence of increased Aβ chaperoning [3], or direct positive effects of the agent on neurovascular integrity and function [4].

40|$|ABSTRACT Addition of the hypocholesteremic agent <b>Probucol</b> ((4, 4 '-isopropylidine dithio) -bis(2, 6 -di-t-butyl-phenol)) to {{the diet}} of laying hens {{at up to}} 1 % {{significantly}} reduced egg yolk cholesterol content (mg/g yolk) without impairment of rate of egg production, egg weight, shell strength, albumen quality, or other production related parameters. Dietary concentration of. 1 % <b>Probucol</b> significantly reduced yolk cholesterol within 2 weeks after feeding. Higher concentrations did not further reduce yolk cholesterol. <b>Probucol</b> at. 025 % reduced egg yolk cholesterol within 4 weeks after feeding, but after 8 weeks of feeding, eggs from hens fed. 025 % <b>Probucol</b> {{did not differ significantly}} in yolk cholesterol from those fed the basal unsupplemented diet.

40|$|A {{significant}} reduction in plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is a recognised consequence of treatment with <b>probucol.</b> By contrast, fibrate therapy in general has the opposite effect. We report two cases where the combination of <b>probucol</b> and a fibrate led to profoundly reduced plasma levels of HDL cholesterol associated with very low levels of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). In the first, bezafibrate was added to <b>probucol,</b> and in the second, <b>probucol</b> added {{to a combination of}} simvastatin and fenofibrate. In both cases, plasma levels of HDL and apoA-I returned towards normal after discontinuation of one or both drugs, indicating that the reduction was reversible...|$|E
40|$|Background—Restenosis {{remains the}} major {{limitation}} of coronary angioplasty. Coronary stents {{have reduced the}} incidence of restenosis in selected patients with relatively large vessels. No strategies to date have demonstrated a beneficial effect in vessels, 3. 0 mm in diameter. We have shown in the MultiVitamins and <b>Probucol</b> (MVP) Trial that <b>probucol,</b> a potent antioxidant, reduces restenosis after balloon angioplasty. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether the benefit of <b>probucol</b> therapy is maintained in the subgroup of patients with smaller coronary vessels. Methods and Results—We studied a subgroup of 189 patients included in the MVP trial who underwent successful balloon angioplasty of at least one coronary segment with a reference diameter, 3. 0 mm. One month before angioplasty, patients were randomly assigned to one of four treatments: placebo, <b>probucol</b> (500 mg), multivitamins (beta-carotene 30 000 IU, vitamin C 500 mg, and vitamin E 700 IU), or <b>probucol</b> plus multivitamins twice daily. The treatment was maintained until follow-up angiography was performed at 6 months. The mean reference diameter of this study population was 2. 4960. 34 mm. Lumen loss was 0. 1260. 34 mm for <b>probucol,</b> 0. 2560. 43 mm for the combined treatment, 0. 3560. 56 mm for vitamins, and 0. 3860. 51 mm for placebo (P 5. 005 for <b>probucol).</b> Restenosis rates per segment wer...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of malaria pathogens having resistance against antimalarials implies {{the necessity for}} the development of new drugs. Recently, we have demonstrated a resistance against malaria infection of α-tocopherol transfer protein knockout mice showing undetectable plasma levels of α-tocopherol, a lipid-soluble antioxidant. However, dietary restriction induced α-tocopherol deficiency is difficult to be applied as a clinical antimalarial therapy. Here, we report on a new strategy to potentially treat malaria by using <b>probucol,</b> a drug that can reduce the plasma α-tocopherol concentration. <b>Probucol</b> pre-treatment for 2 weeks and treatment throughout the infection rescued from death of mice infected with Plasmodium yoelii XL- 17 or P. berghei ANKA. In addition, survival was extended when the treatment started immediately after parasite inoculation. The ratio of lipid peroxidation products to parent lipids increased in plasma after 2 weeks treatment of <b>probucol.</b> This indicates that the protective effect of <b>probucol</b> might be mediated by the oxidative stressful environment induced by α-tocopherol deficiency. <b>Probucol</b> in combination with dihydroartemisin suppressed the proliferation of P. yoelii XL- 17. These results indicated that <b>probucol</b> might be a candidate for a drug against malaria infection by inducing α-tocopherol deficiency without dietary α-tocopherol restriction...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: Oxidized low-density {{lipoprotein}} (ox-LDL) {{is a major}} component of hyperlipidemia and contributes to atherosclerosis. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) {{play an important role in}} preventing atherosclerosis and notably decreased in hyperlipidemia. Ox-LDL and ox-LDL-related reactive oxygen species (ROS) have deleterious effects on EPCs. <b>Probucol</b> as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory drug reduces ROS production. The present study was to determine if <b>probucol</b> could protect EPCs from ox-LDL in vivo and to investigate the potential mechanisms. Methods: ox-LDL was injected into male C 57 BL/ 6 mice for 3 days with or without <b>probucol</b> treatment with PBS as control. Bone marrow (BM) fluid, serum, circulating mononuclear cells (MNCs) and EPCs were collected for analysis. Results: the increased extracellular ROS in BM, serum and blood intracellular ROS production in the mice with ox-LDL treatment in association with a significant reduction of circulating MNCs and EPCs were restored with <b>Probucol</b> treatment. A significant increase in the serum ox-LDL and C-reactive protein and decrease in superoxide dismutase and circulating MNCs and EPCs were observed in hyperlipidemic patients that were effectively reversed with <b>probucol</b> treatment. Conclusion: these data suggested that <b>probucol</b> could protect EPCs from ox-LDL through inhibition of ROS production in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of human}} plasma lipoproteins as {{carriers}} {{in the blood}} transport of the choles-terol-lowering and water-insoluble drug, <b>probucol,</b> was investigated in in vitro studies. [‘ 4 C]Probucol was incubated in whole human blood, a serum pool, individual diluted sera, and isolated protein and lipoprotein fractions. In whole blood, about 90 % partitioned in plasma. Following ultracentrifugal fractionation of the serum, {{it was found that}} less than 5 % distributed in the d> 1. 20 protein fraction (albumin-rich fraction) and more than 95 % in the lipoprotein fractions. The distribution of <b>probucol</b> in the lipoprotein fractions correlated with the lipoprotein total lipid volume under saturation conditions (incubation of isolated lipoprotein fractions) as well as nonsaturation conditions (fractionation of serum exposed to [14 C]probucol). Incubation of the albumin-rich fraction and of apoli-poproteins originating from the isolated lipoprotein fractions showed that they account for a negligible part in the interaction of <b>probucol</b> with blood components. The <b>probucol</b> uptake of individual sera was shown to be correlated to the lipid content of the serum.

40|$|<b>Probucol</b> is a {{cholesterol-lowering}} and antioxidant {{drug that}} {{has been shown to}} inhibit or delay the progression of athero-sclerosis. This antiatherosclerotic effect may result from the removal of oxidized cholesterol on the surface of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). To investigate whether <b>probucol</b> transfers oxidized cholesterol from LDL to urine, urine samples were obtained from five patients with hypercholes-terolaemia treated with 500 -mg <b>probucol</b> orally daily and from five healthy controls. Using gas chromatography- mass spectrometry, we identified cholesteryl- 6 -(2, 6 -di-tertiary butylphenol- 4) -thioether (CT) in the urine samples from patients with hypercholesterolaemia but not from healthy controls. This result suggests that <b>probucol</b> is hydrolysed to form 4 -mercapto- 2, 6 -di. tertiary butylphenol (MBP) which conjugates with cholesterol- 5 a, 6 a-epoxide, oxidized cholesterol, resulting in the formation of CT in vivo. In addition to its hypolipidaemic and antioxidant actions, <b>probucol</b> may act to prevent atherosclerosis by increasing the urinary excretion of oxidized cholesterol...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Probucol</b> {{has been}} shown to prevent {{cerebral}} capillary disturbances characterized by blood-to-brain extravasation of plasma derived proteins and neurovascular inflammation in mice maintained on western-styled diets for 12 weeks. However the effect of <b>probucol</b> on capillary integrity in aging models with capillary dysfunction is not known. Methods: Wild-type C 57 BL 6 mice were randomized to a low-fat (LF); saturated-fat (SFA); or SFA + <b>Probucol</b> diet for up to 12 months of intervention. Results: Mice fed the LF diet had substantially greater parenchymal abundance of plasma derived IgG and apo B lipoproteins at 12 months, compared to LF mice at 3 months of intervention. Markers of neurovascular inflammation were also greater at 12 months in LF fed mice compared to LF mice at 3 months. The SFA diet exacerbated the aging induced parenchymal abundance of IgG and of apo B lipoproteins and neurovascular inflammation at 12 months. The SFA effects were associated with increased production of intestinal lipoprotein amyloid-ß (Aß). The co-provision of <b>probucol</b> with the SFA completely abolished heightened inflammation at 12 months. <b>Probucol</b> attenuated SFA-induced capillary permeability but had only a modest inhibitory effect on parenchymal retention of apoB lipoproteins. The improvements in markers of inflammation and capillary integrity because of <b>probucol</b> correlated with enterocytic genesis of chylomicron Aß. Conclusion: In this long-term feeding study, <b>probucol</b> profoundly suppressed dietary SFA induced disturbances in capillary integrity but had a more modest effect on age-associated changes...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} implicated in atherogenesis, yet most {{clinical}} trials with antioxidants, particularly vitamin E, {{have failed to}} protect against atherosclerotic diseases. A striking exception is <b>probucol,</b> which retards atherosclerosis in carotid arteries and restenosis of coronary arteries after angioplasty. Because <b>probucol</b> has in vitro cellular-protective effects independent of inhibiting lipid oxidation, we investigated the mode of action of <b>probucol</b> in vivo. We used three models of vascular disease: apolipoprotein E–deficient mice, a model of atherosclerosis; rabbit aortic balloon injury, a model of restenosis; and carotid injury in obese Zucker rats, a model of type 2 diabetes. Unexpectedly, we observed that the phenol moieties of <b>probucol</b> were insufficient, whereas its sulphur atoms were required for protection. <b>Probucol</b> and its sulphur-containing metabolite, but not a sulphur-free phenolic analogue, protected via cell-specific effects on inhibiting macrophage accumulation, stimulating reendothelialization, and inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. These processes were mediated via induction of heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), an activity not shared by vitamin E. Our findings identify HO- 1 as the molecular target of <b>probucol.</b> They indicate 2 -electron rather than radical (1 -electron) oxidants as important contributors to atherogenesis, and point to novel lead compounds for therapeutic intervention against atherosclerotic diseases...|$|E
40|$|Background. Restenosis after {{percutaneous}} transluminal {{coronary angioplasty}} {{is the major}} limitation of the long-term success of this procedure. The process of restenosis is similar to an accelerated form of atherosclerosis. Thus, therapeutic interventions that limit the progression and initiation of atheroscle-rosis may be beneficial in the treatment of restenosis. One such intervention is the antioxidant drug <b>probucol,</b> which has demonstrated benefit in animal models of atherosclerosis. Methods and Results. Twenty-six female domestic swine were divided into three study groups (control, n= 9; low-dose <b>probucol,</b> n= 9; high-dose <b>probucol,</b> n= 8) before oversized balloon injury of the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries. <b>Probucol</b> (1 g/d, low-dose group; 2 g/d, high-dose group) was administered 2 days before balloon injury and was continued until the swine were killed 2 weeks after balloon injury. Morphometric analysis of the injured arteries included the intimal area (square millimeters), maximal intimal thickness (millimeters), and residual lumen (ratio of luminal to intimal plus luminal area). Treatment with high-dose <b>probucol</b> significantly reduced neointimal formation compared with control animals (decreases of 36 % in intimal area, P=. 007; 20 % in maximal intimal thickness, P=NS; and an increase of 15 % in residual lumen, P=. 02).
