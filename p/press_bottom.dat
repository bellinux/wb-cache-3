5|$|Mating is {{initiated}} when {{up to five}} males follow closely {{behind a}} female and bite at her fins and body, possibly cued by pheromones indicating the female's readiness. Each male attempts to seize the female by engulfing one of her pectoral fins; at times two males might grasp a female on both sides simultaneously. Once engaged, the sharks sink to the bottom, whereupon the male (or males) rotates one of his claspers forward, inflates the associated siphon sac (a subcutaneous abdominal organ that takes in seawater {{that is used to}} flush sperm into the female), and attempts to make contact with the female's vent. In many cases, the female resists by pressing her belly against the bottom and arching her tail; this may reflect mate choice on her part. The male has a limited time in which to achieve copulation, as while he is holding the female's pectoral fin in his mouth he is being deprived of oxygen. On the other hand, if the female is willing, the pair settles side-by-side with their heads <b>pressed</b> against the <b>bottom</b> and their bodies at an upward angle.|$|R
40|$|Carbon-fiber-reinforced {{thermoplastic}} (CFRTP) {{is viewed}} as a prospective material for high-cycle production of CFRP parts. This paper deals with a process whereby a preheated thermoplastic plain-woven carbon fiber fabric sheet is formed into a circular cup by a mechanical servo-press. The effects of press parameters, specifically the bottom dead center and slide speed in the forming of CFRTP cup, on the press load, pressure, internal temperature, shape accuracy, and internal structure have been investigated. A plain-woven carbon-fiber-reinforced PA 6 thermoplastic sheet was used. The sheet consisted of four layers of woven 3 K carbon and had a thickness of 1 mm. The sheet was heated to 320 °C under a halogen heater so that it would be around the recommended temperature for forming 260 °C after transfer to the mold. The sheet was pressed into a circular cup shape by a cold mold while the periphery was cramped by a heated holder so as not to cool the sheet before it was pulled into the mold cave. Die clearance was designed considering the thickness increase due to the fiber concentration during the forming. By increasing the slide stroke to the bottom dead center, the applied press load was increased and the internal structure was improved, showing no voids. By increasing the slide speed, the final press load was reduced and shape accuracy was improved through a good pressure distribution on the mold. Measurement of the surface temperature of the sheet during the forming revealed that it remained in the melting region of the resin in the case of fast slide speed, but dropped below the melting temperature in the case of low slide speed. This difference apparently led to spring-in or spring-back after the forming. The experimental results indicate that appropriate balance among <b>press</b> speed, <b>bottom</b> dead center, and sheet temperature is important in the high-cycle forming of CFRTP. © 2016, Fuji Technology Press.

40|$|LES (Large Eddy Simulation) of a {{film cooling}} with a {{swirling}} coolant jet has performed for a circular hole at the blowing ratios of M = 0. 5 and 1. 0. For the LES of film cooling flows, a film-hole model based on a RFG (Random Flow Generation) technique was proposed to simulate turbulent fluctuating flows at the exit plane of film cooling hole as a boundary model. As a result, film cooling with a swirling coolant jet is confirmed to be effective to reduce net heat transfer from the hot gas to the wall at given uniform temperature conditions by about 6 % and 12 % at the blowing ratio of M = 0. 5 and 1. 0, respectively, compared to non-swirling cases. In a swirling film coolant jet case at M = 1. 0, penetration of coolant jet is suppressed. It seems {{that one of the}} two jet core regions is <b>pressed</b> against the <b>bottom</b> wall by the primary swirl of the coolant jet itself, and this seems to prevent the detachment of the film coolant from the wall. In addition, the proposed film-hole model for LES was validated by the comparison of predicted center-line film effectiveness with a known experimental result...|$|R

40|$|WineGuide is a {{geographical}} bound recommendation service for wine and food adapted to mobile phones. The service addresses well-known problems within {{the area of}} shopping, by: (1) offering expert recommendations; (2) notifying the user where products are available; (3) distributing information in appropriate situations; (4) letting the user search for products. WineGuide {{is part of a}} greater effort to investigate the novel area of geographical bound retailing in conjunction with expert recommendations. The research was accomplished through the research approach used by Mobile Informatics at the Viktoria Institute. Initially an observational feasibility study was carried out to test the WineGuide context, followed by a design and development phase. Finally, the service was evaluated at the Swedish Rally and at two IT-companies. The findings of the study showed two different approaches on how expert recommendation services affect geographical bound eCommerce in retailing. The position adapted approach, which will affect the logistics with new business conspiracies and distribution models to be able to compete. The Individual adapted, which will emphasise a large set of participating retailers, which must continually update the offers of the services to make them attractive. The research also proved that the full potential of the WineGuide service could only be established through an eCommerce transaction implementation.

40|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) consists of two bundles, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral bundle (PM). Double bundle reconstructions appear to give better rotational stability. The usual technique is to make two tunnels in the femur and two in the tibia. This is difficult and in small knees {{may not even be}} possible. We have developed a foreign material free press fit fixation for double bundle ACL reconstruction using a single femoral tunnel (R). This is based on the ALL PRESS FIT ACL reconstruction. It is suitable for the most common medium and, otherwise difficult, small sizes of knees. Method: Using diamond edged wet grinding hollow reamers, bone cylinders in different diameters are harvested from the implantation tunnels of the tibia and femur and used for the press fit fixation. Using the press fit technique the graft is first fixed in tibia. It is then similarly fixed under tension in the femoral side with the knee in 120 degree flexion. This is called Bottom To Top Fixation (BTT). On extending the knee the graft tension is self adapting. Depending {{on the size of the}} individual knee, the diameter of the femoral bone plug is varied from 8 to 13 mm to achieve an anatomic spread with a double bundle-like insertion. The tibia tunnel can be applied with two 7 or 8 mm diameter tunnels overlapping to a semi oval tunnel between 10 to 13 mm. Results: Since May 2003 we have carried out ACL-reconstructions with Hamstring grafts without foreign material using the ALL PRESS FIT technique. Initially, an 8 mm press fit fixation was used proximally with good results. Since April 2008, the range of diameters was increased up to 13 mm. The results of the Lachman tests have been good to excellent. Results of the Pivot shift test suggested more stability with femoral broader diameters of 9, 5 to 13 mm. Conclusions: The foreign material free fixation of hamstring in the ALL <b>PRESS</b> FIT <b>Bottom</b> To Top Fixation is a successful method for ACL Reconstruction. The Diamond Instruments and tubed guiding devices are precise, reliable and easy to manage. On this basis a double bundle reconstruction is achieved using a single tunnel.

40|$|Weightlessness during spaceflight causes cephalad {{redistribution}} of intravascular and extravascular fluid, provoking cardiovascular and {{autonomic nervous system}} adaptations. The resulting functional state is appropriate for weightlessness but can result in orthostatic hypotension and intolerance during and after return to a persistent acceleration or gravitational environment. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) applies subambient air pressure to the legs and lower abdomen inside a volume sealed at the waist, and decompression by 4050 mmHg reverses the spaceflightinduced cephalad shift. LBNP has been used both to test the state of cardiovascular system during spaceflight and as a countermeasure by all spacefaring nations. Two configurations have thus far been used in spaceflight since the first LBNP flew on the first Soviet Salyut station in 1971. The Soviet and Russian configuration, used in four Salyut stations, the Mir space station and the Russian segment of the International Space Station, has no saddle to support the body so during decompression the feet <b>press</b> against the <b>bottom</b> of the collapsible chamber which shortens and applies force against the feet proportional to the decompression level. Thus, activation of the skeletal musculature partially counteracts vascular and venous pooling in the enclosed body segments, stimulating the orthostatic compensatory mechanisms as they would be standing on Earth. In the American configuration, used aboard Skylab and the Space Shuttle, a saddle supported the astronaut so the feet did not contact {{the bottom of the}} chamber, and vascular engorgement was not countered by muscular contraction. This minimized skeletal muscle involvement, unmasked vascular compensatory mechanisms for research purposes, and allowed measurements of changes in leg volume and muscle sympathetic nerve activity. Both variants have demonstrated research and therapeutic value in appropriately designed protocols. LBNP continues to be used for research and countermeasures on ISS, and future versions may explore the value of exercise during LBNP as an integrated countermeasure. This paperwill review the history and development of LBNP for spaceflight research and therapeutic purposes...|$|R

For in vitro studies, methods for surface pre-conditioning with blood or 25 % serum, the physiologically relevant serum concentration found in blood, prior to bacterial inoculation were {{selected based on}} several published studies investigating the in vitro effects of blood-bacteria interactions for CVC applications [43 - 45]. Two agitation states were investigated as a CVC is subjected {{to a range of}} shear forces from static environments inside the lumen to flow rates of 17 – 81  ml/min in the blood vessel, depending on the tube size [46]. Micropatterned and unpatterned 12  mm TPU coupons (n= 4) were <b>pressed</b> to the <b>bottom</b> of a sterile Petri dish around the outer perimeter. Coupons were immersed in either citrate-treated whole blood (Bonfils Blood Bank) or 25 % serum in PBS (Interstate Blood Bank) for 2  h at 37 °C either statically or dynamically (30  rpm) to match the inoculation condition. The pre-treatment media was rinsed three times by adding 20  ml of sterile PBS to the dish, swirling (80  rpm) for 30  s on an orbital shaker, and decanting the rinsate. Surfaces were then immersed in 20  ml of inoculum containing ~ 107 (static) or ~ 108 (dynamic) CFU/ml of either S. aureus or S. epidermidis and statically or dynamically incubated for 1 and 18  h at 37 °C. After incubation, the inoculum suspension was decanted, surfaces were rinsed three times identically as washing following pre-treatment, punched with an 8  mm biopsy punch, vortexed and sonicated as described above. Bacterial eluate solutions were enumerated by a 10 -fold dilution series, plating each dilution onto TSA, and counting the colony forming units (CFU) after sufficient growth at 37 °C overnight. Each CFU per surface data point was log 10 transformed before statistical analysis. Each experiment was replicated three times. Fluorescent microscopy was used to qualitatively verify the 18  h CFU results by fixing with 4 % paraformaldehyde and staining with TOTO®- 3. Images were obtained in three pre-selected sites per surface by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 META on Axiovert 200  M).|$|R

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymers are {{advanced materials}} with unique material properties {{that are being}} used in an increasingly number of industrial applications. In well intervention the high stiffness to weight ratio {{as well as the}} chemical resistance is being utilized to make a semi-stiff rod for logging purposes. The carbon rod has several advantages over its competitors, but the performance can be further improved for use in the horizontal sections of the well. As a solid carbon rod, the submerged weight causes the rod to <b>press</b> against the <b>bottom</b> of the casing generating friction which prevents the desired reach. By making the rod hollow, the submerged weight will reduce significantly and the rod will stay buoyant in the casing, hence extending the reach. The main focus {{of this study was to}} find and develop manufacturing methods for a continuous rod consisting of an inner layer of pure hoop and an outer layer of longitudinal fibers. One of the suggested methods included a filament wound hoop layer using a PPS thermoplastic impregnated carbon fiber tape with lay-up configuration corresponding to the previous tested rods based on epoxy resin. The PPS-rod was then tested with external overpressure and axial compression, the same tests performed on the epoxy-rod. The rods are considered as thick-walled tubes and had an outer diameter equal to 15 mm, which is the same as the current solid rod in field operation, and inner diameters at 12 mm. They were made using the filament winding machine at NTNU. The epoxy-rod was made with resin bath to ensure a good and even impregnation of the fibers, while a gas torch was used to melt the PPS-tape. Two rods were produced using a custom setup in the filament winding machine. Due to the provisional setup it is obvious the process and quality need more development. The rods were leaking under low pressure, and when sealed, the failure load was inconsistent and about 35 % of the failure load of the rod with made with epoxy. Microscopy shows many voids and cracks so the poor results are easily explained. Although the results could not be used to determine the potential of a rod based on a PPS matrix, the manufacturing method was proved to be a feasible way to produce a rod with the desired layup. The rod extracted easily from the mandrel and a continuous process seems feasible. Tensile tests on laminates of the PPS impregnated tape showed satisfying material properties. A study of different layups for the rod has also been conducted. Rods with layups [&# 177; 45 &# 176;] and [&# 177; 80 &# 176;/&# 177; 9 &# 176;] has been wound and tested with external overpressure and axial compression.

Future work based on this study should focus on improving the manufacturing method of the PPS-rod. An adhesion test should also be conducted to determine how the PPS hoop rod bonds with a pultrusion resin. Temperature resistance is also an issue not discussed in this study and needs to be investigated as well as long term testing and the effect of creep. </p...|$|R
