40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} algorithms for designing disk-loaded travelling-wave output structures for X-band klystrons {{to be used}} in the SLAC NLC. We use either a four- or five-cell structure in a π/ 2 mode. The disk radii are tapered to produce an approximately constant gradient. The matching calculation is not performed on the tapered structure, but rather on a coupler whose input and output cells are the same as the final cell of the tapered structure, and whose interior cells are the same as the penultimate cell in the tapered structure. 2 -D calculations using CONDOR model the waveguide as a radial transmission line of adjustable impedance. 3 -D calculations with MAFIA model the actual rectangular waveguide and coupling slot. A good match is obtained by adjusting the impedance of the final cell. In 3 -D, this requires varying both the radius of the cell and the width of the aperture. When the output cell with the best match is inserted in the tapered structure, we obtain excellent cold-test agreement between the 2 -D and 3 -D models. We use hot-test simulations with CONDOR to design a structure with maximum efficiency and minimum surface fields. We have designed circuits at 11. 424 Ghz for different <b>perveances.</b> At 440 kV, microperveance 1. 2, we calculated 81 MW, 53 percent efficiency, with peak surface field 76 MV/m. A microperveance 0. 6 design was done using a PPM stack for focusing. At 470 kV, 193 amps, we calculated 58. 7 MW, 64. 7 percent efficiency, peak surface field 62. 3 MV/m.

40|$|Ion {{thruster}} {{total impulse}} capability is limited, in part, by accelerator grid sputter erosion. A development effort was initiated {{to identify a}} material with a lower accelerator grid volumetric sputter erosion rate than molybdenum, but that could utilize the present NSTAR thruster grid design and fabrication techniques to keep development costs low, and perform as well as molybdenum optics. After comparing the sputter erosion rates of several atomic materials to that of molybdenum at accelerator voltages, titanium was found to offer a 45 % reduction in volumetric erosion rates. To ensure that screen grid sputter erosion rates are not higher at discharge chamber potentials, titanium and molybdenum sputter erosion rates were measured at these potentials. Preliminary results showed only a slightly higher volumetric erosion rate for titanium, so that screen grid erosion is insignificant. A number of material, thermal, and mechanical properties were also examined to identify any fabrication, launch environment, and thruster operation issues. Several titanium grid sets were successfully fabricated. A titanium grid set was mounted onto an NSTAR 30 cm engineering model ion thruster and tested to determine optics performance. The titanium optics operated successfully over the entire NSTAR power range of 0. 5 to 2. 3 kW. Differences in impingement-limited <b>perveances</b> and electron backstreaming limits {{were found to be}} due to a larger cold gap for the titanium optics. Discharge losses for titanium grids were lower than those for molybdenum, likely due to a slightly larger titanium screen grid open area fraction. Radial distributions of beam current density with titanium optics were very similar to those with molybdenum optics at all power levels. Temporal electron backstreaming limit measurements showed that titanium optics achieved thermal equilibrium faster than molybdenum optics...|$|R

40|$|Total 12 {{units of}} high power klystron-modulator systems are under {{continuous}} {{operation in the}} Pohang Light Source (PLS) linac. The peak powers of the modulator and the klystron are 200 MW and 80 MW, respectively. The total heater run time of an oldest klystron system has been accumulated over 75, 000 -hours as of now. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} monitor the klystron operational status for stable beam operation. It can be achieved by measuring the klystron <b>perveance</b> to diagnose characteristics of klystron. Up to now, the operator manually performs it. We have designed the <b>perveance</b> monitor by processing the sensing signal of a beam voltage and current of the klystron. It takes advantage of the time saving in diagnosing klystron performance. In addition, a highly accurate current and voltage sensor is one of the critical components of the measuring system. This paper presents the design concepts and initial test results of the <b>perveance</b> monitor to diagnose characteristics of klystron. <b>Perveance</b> definition The klystron is a device for amplifying signals at microwave radio frequencies. The <b>perveance</b> is an important design parameter since it is totally determined by electron gun dimensions. When the cathode is operated in the space-charge-limited region, the emission current will be a specific function of the applied voltage [2]. The constant, k, {{is a function of the}} geometry of the cathode-anode structure, and is termed <b>perveance.</b> It is space-charge characteristic between electrodes in a klystron tube. It is equal to the current (Ik) divided by the electronic potential (Vk) of the collector raised to the 3 / 2 powers [3]. Basic design concept The <b>perveance</b> monitor can be divided into two major sections: a pulse conditioning & peak hold module (PCPHM) section, a <b>perveance</b> processor module (PPM) section.

40|$|A 75 watt CW high {{efficiency}} helix TWT operating at 20 GHz {{was developed for}} satellite communication systems. The purpose was to extend the performance capabilities of helix TWTs by using recent technology developments. The TWT described is a unique design because high overall efficiency is obtained with a low <b>perveance</b> beam. In the past, low <b>perveance</b> designs resulted in low beam efficiencies. However, due to recent breakthoughs in diamond rod technology and in collector electrode materials, high efficiencies can now be achieved with low <b>perveance</b> beams. The advantage of a low <b>perveance</b> beam is a reduction in space charge within the beam which translates to more efficient collector operation. In addition, this design incorporates textured graphite electrodes which further enhance collector operation by suppressing backstreaming secondaries. The diamond supported helix circuit features low RF losses, high interaction impedance, good thermal handling capability and {{has been designed to}} compensate for the low <b>perveance</b> beam.
