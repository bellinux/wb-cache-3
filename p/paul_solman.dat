5000|$|Together Papola and Roberts made {{a hip-hop}} music video about the economy, “Fear the Boom and Bust.” [...] The video was {{released}} on YouTube on January 25, 2010, after debuting on a late 2009 episode of the PBS Newshour that featured a debate on economics in which Papola and Roberts took on Keynes biographer Robert Skidelsky. Although the video “tilts toward Hayek,” Skidelsky himself described the Keynes portion of the video as “Absolutely fair and brilliantly rhymed. It's not a complete account of Keynes {{but it seems to}} be completely right.” The video was translated into over a dozen languages, and was praised by PBS, NPR, CNBC, the Chicago Tribune and the New York Times. <b>Paul</b> <b>Solman</b> has written that when PBS News House announced plans to debut the Keynes vs. Hayek video rap, “it was anticipated with derision.” Yet, as Solman notes, the video rap “may well have {{become one of the most}} popular lessons in the history of macroeconomics.” As of July, 2013, it had over 4.3 million YouTube hits.|$|E
5000|$|The Cambridge Phoenix {{was born}} on October 9, 1969, founded by Jeffrey Tarter. In the summer of 1972, Richard Missner, owner of what was then simply called [...] "The Phoenix," [...] fired editor Harper Barnes in a journalistic dispute. A union was formed {{and almost all of}} the staff went on strike. An {{agreement}} was reached within two weeks, without Barnes reinstatement. Soon afterwards, the staff was informed of the purchase of the paper - its name and goodwill - by Stephen Mindich, owner of the more established (and more commercial) competitor Boston After Dark. Hoping to eliminate his direct competition. Mindich renamed his paper The Boston Phoenix After Dark, later shortened back to The Boston Phoenix. The entire former staff of The Phoenix was now unemployed, the lone exception being the late sportswriter George Kimball, who went to work for Mindich.
