5|$|Although he had stated an {{interest}} in playing the trumpet, Marmarosa's parents <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> {{to take up the}} piano, which he began at the age of 9. He received classical music lessons, but was influenced by the jazz playing of Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, and others after fellow pianist Erroll Garner, four years Marmarosa's elder, introduced him to their music. Marmarosa practiced a lot, until his left and right hands were equally strong.|$|E

5|$|Governor Henry Lee III of Virginia, {{a friend}} of Harrison's father, learned of William's {{situation}} and <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> to join the military. Within twenty-four hours of meeting Lee, eighteen-year-old Harrison was commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Army, 1st Infantry Regiment.

5|$|The {{extended}} Robinson family established {{itself on}} a residential plot containing two small houses at 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena. Robinson's mother worked various odd jobs {{to support the}} family. Growing up in relative poverty in an otherwise affluent community, Robinson and his minority friends were excluded from many recreational opportunities. As a result, Robinson joined a neighborhood gang, but his friend Carl Anderson <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> to abandon it.|$|E
5|$|According to the Life of St. Theodore of Syceon, Domentziolus {{fell into}} a Persian ambush but was able to escape. In 604/605, he also {{surrounded}} Narses and his troops, and <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> to surrender on guarantees of his personal safety. Phocas, nonetheless, had Narses executed by burning him alive. At about the same time, Dara, an important Byzantine city in Mesopotamia, fell to the Persians. Khosrau was encouraged to cease simply raiding the Byzantine provinces, instead attempting to conquer them. In 607, he launched concurrent invasions on Mesopotamia and Armenia.|$|E

5|$|Another {{feature of}} Wood's {{conducting}} was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check {{the instrument of}} {{each member of the}} woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> that it was no longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.|$|E
5|$|Betances {{was awarded}} the rank of Chévalier (Knight) of the Legion of Honor by the French {{government}} in July 1887, for {{his work as a}} diplomat for the Dominican Republic, and for his work as a medical doctor in France. He had been offered the award as early as 1882, but had repeatedly declined the honor out of humility, until friends from Puerto Rico <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> to accept it as a tribute to Puerto Rico, and not as a personal award. The French Legion of Honor (Légion d'honneur) is the premier order of France, and its award is one of great distinction.|$|E
5|$|Blitz {{conceived}} a rough storyline for {{the film}} while making Spellbound, a documentary about 1999's Scripps National Spelling Bee, but an HBO Films executive <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> to write the film based on his own adolescence {{when he told her}} about his experiences as a stutterer. The film's producers visited several cities in the United States and Canada; Thompson was cast based on a tape which his agent had sent and a follow-up audition after the first actor cast in the lead was forced to pull out. The film was shot over 30 days in Baltimore, Maryland and Trenton, New Jersey.|$|E

This was to <b>persuade</b> <b>Him,</b> that what He had done already was mere folly, and <b>persuade</b> <b>Him</b> to alter, yea, to disannul the whole way of {{salvation}}.

5|$|Ernuszt and {{his younger}} brother, John Ernuszt, made several {{attempts}} to regain the estates that Matthias Corvinus had confiscated from their father in the early 1470s. They <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> to give them their father's former copper mines at Besztercebánya (now Banská Bystrica in Slovakia) in 1494. Soon after, they leased the mines to John and George Thurzó for 10 years. They also regained Szklabonya (Sklabiná in Slovakia) from Anton Poki, a retainer of John Corvinus. The Ernuszt brothers, who held more than 3,500 peasant households, were among the wealthiest landowners in Hungary in 1494.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Walton was {{presented}} with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work {{came to a halt}} in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.|$|E

In June 1970 {{he became the first}} actor to be created a peer for services to the theatre.

Max Newman withdrew from the project, believing that the development of computers required engineers and not mathematicians at this point, but Williams preferred to return to electrotechnics, leaving Kilburn in charge. He was assisted by Alan Turing, who arrived at Manchester in 1948. The Mark I incorporated innovations such as index registers, and combined CRTs with magnetic drum storage. Nine Mark I computers were sold by between 1951 and 1957.|$|E

Motohiro and his staff were {{surprised}} with Gen Urobuchi's contribution to the highly acclaimed anime series, Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Motohiro was fascinated by Madoka Magica; he read other works from Urobuchi, which <b>persuaded</b> <b>him</b> to talk to Urobuchi. In early 2011, Motohiro proposed to Urobuchi that the pair should work together.

5|$|The Sector General series {{began as}} short stories {{published}} in New Worlds from 1957 onwards.

He extended the stories' range by introducing new central characters beginning with Code Blue - Emergency (1987), and The Genocidal Healer (1992) focused on psychological and theological issues of guilt and forgiveness rather than strictly medical ones.|$|E
