50|$|A <b>pastry</b> <b>brush,</b> {{also known}} as a basting brush, is a cooking utensil used to spread butter, oil or glaze on food. Traditional pastry brushes are made with natural {{bristles}} or a plastic or nylon fiber similar to a paint brush, while modern kitchen brushes may have silicone bristles. In baking breads and pastries, a <b>pastry</b> <b>brush</b> is used to spread a glaze or egg wash on the crust or surface of the food.In roasting meats, a <b>pastry</b> <b>brush</b> may be used to sop up juices or drippings from under pan and spread them {{on the surface of the}} meat to crisp the skin.|$|E
50|$|Also {{common is}} the {{practice}} of dotting the bread. This creates multiple wells in the bread by using a finger or the handle of a utensil to poke the unbaked dough. As a way to preserve moisture in the bread, olive oil is then spread over the dough, by hand or with a <b>pastry</b> <b>brush</b> prior to rising and baking. In {{the northern part of}} Italy, lard will sometimes be added to the dough, giving the focaccia a softer, slightly flakier texture. Focaccia recipes are widely available, and with the popularity of bread machines, many cookbooks now provide versions of dough recipes that do not require hand kneading.|$|E
50|$|Malawach {{resembles a}} thick pancake, and it {{consists}} of thin layers of puff <b>pastry</b> <b>brushed</b> with oil or fat and cooked flat in a frying pan. It is traditionally served with hard-boiled eggs, Sahawiq, and a crushed or grated tomato dip. Or for a sweet taste, it is often served with honey.|$|R

A gas-powered sac griddle can be seen inside the red oven to the right, with two thin wooden rolling pins ("oklava") and <b>pastry</b> <b>brushes</b> used to prepare the dough to the lower left. The cook is seen cutting up the finished gözleme on her pastry board table to prepare for final serving.|$|R
50|$|Flaounes are savoury Easter {{pastries}} {{that contain}} goats cheese (or {{a variety of}} cheeses), eggs, spices and herbs all wrapped in a yeast <b>pastry,</b> then <b>brushed</b> with egg yolk and dipped into sesame seeds.|$|R
5000|$|Occasionally {{shells of}} huff paste were baked empty, or [...] "blind". After baking, the <b>pastry</b> was <b>brushed</b> with egg yolk {{to give it}} a golden color. Later, the shell was filled with a mixture of meat and spices and then baked.|$|R
5000|$|Linzer Torte {{is a very}} short, crumbly pastry made of flour, {{unsalted}} butter, egg yolks, lemon zest, {{cinnamon and}} lemon juice, and ground nuts, usually hazelnuts, but even walnuts or almonds are used, covered with a filling of redcurrant jam or, alternatively, plum butter, thick raspberry, [...] or apricot jam. It is covered by a lattice of dough strips. The dough is rolled out in very thin strips of pastry and arranged to form a criss-cross design {{on top of the}} preserves. The <b>pastry</b> is <b>brushed</b> with lightly beaten egg whites, baked, and sometimes decorated with sliced almonds.|$|R
40|$|Data on the {{microbial}} quality of food service kitchen surfaces and ready-to-eat foods were collected {{over a period}} of 10 years in Rutgers University dining halls. Surface bacterial counts, total aerobic plate counts, and total and fecal coliform counts were determined using standard methods. Analysis was performed on foods tested more than 50 times (primarily lunch meats and deli salads) and on surfaces tested more than 500 times (36 different surfaces types, including <b>pastry</b> <b>brushes,</b> cutting boards, and countertops). Histograms and statistical distributionswere determined using Microsoft Excel and Palisades Best t, respectively. All data could be described by lognormal distributions, once data above and below the lower and upper limits of detection were considered separately. Histograms for surfaces counts contained one peak near 1 CFU/ 4 cm 2. Surfaces with higher levels of contamination tended to be nonmetal, with the exception of buffalo chopper bowls, which commonly had high counts. Mean counts for foods ranged from 2 to 4 log CFU/g, with shrimp salad, roast beef, and bologna having higher means. Coleslaw, macaroni salad, and potato salad (all commercially processed products, not prepared in the dining halls) had lowest overall means. Coliforms were most commonly found in sealeg salad (present in 61 % of samples) and least commonly found in coleslaw (present in only 7 % of samples). Coliform counts (when present) were highest on average in shrimp salad and lowest in coleslaw. Average coliform counts for most products were typically between 1 and 2 log most probable number per gram. Fecal coliforms were not typically found in any deli salads or lunch meats...|$|R
