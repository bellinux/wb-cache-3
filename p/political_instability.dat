The interaction between Vedic and Tantric traditions trace back to at least the sixth century, and the surge in Tantra tradition developments during the late medieval period, states Geoffrey Samuel, were a means to confront and cope with Islamic invasions and <b>political</b> <b>instability</b> in and after 14th-century CE.|$|E

After the passage of that act, Armenians from the Soviet Union, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran and other Middle Eastern countries began migrating in large numbers, many fleeing <b>political</b> <b>instability</b> in their host countries. In the 1950s, most Armenian immigrants in the US were from Soviet Armenia and Turkey. The Istanbul pogrom in 1955 frightened the local Turkish Armenian population, which looked to the West for a safe and more prosperous life.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifteenth}} century under the Stewart Dynasty, despite a {{turbulent}} political history, the crown gained greater political control {{at the expense of}} independent lords and regained most of its lost territory to approximately the modern borders of the country. However, the Auld Alliance with France led to the heavy defeat of a Scottish army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 and the death of the king James IV, which would be followed by a long minority and a period of <b>political</b> <b>instability.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lemur {{research}} {{during the}} 18th and 19th centuries focused on taxonomy and specimen collection. Although field observations trickled in from early explorers, modern studies of lemur ecology and behavior {{did not begin}} in earnest until the 1950s and 1960s. Initially hindered by <b>political</b> <b>instability</b> and turmoil on Madagascar during the mid-1970s, field studies resumed in the 1980s and have greatly increased the understanding of these primates. Research facilities like the Duke Lemur Center have provided research opportunities under more controlled settings. Lemurs are important for research because their mix of ancestral characteristics and traits shared with anthropoid primates can yield insights on primate and human evolution. However, many lemur species are threatened with extinction due to habitat loss and hunting. Although local traditions generally help protect lemurs and their forests, illegal logging, widespread poverty, and <b>political</b> <b>instability</b> hinder and undermine conservation efforts. Because of these threats and their declining numbers, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) considers lemurs to be the world's most endangered mammals, noting that—as of 2013—up to 90% of all lemur species face extinction within the next 20 to 25years.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Queen Tripurasundari in 1832, his strongest supporter, and the {{adulthood}} of King Rajendra, weakened {{his hold on}} power. The conspiracies and infighting with rival courtiers (especially the Pandes, who held Bhimsen Thapa {{responsible for the death}} of Damodar Pande in 1804) finally led to his imprisonment and death by suicide in 1839. However, the court infighting did not subside with his death, and the <b>political</b> <b>instability</b> eventually paved way for the establishment of the Rana dynasty.|$|E

In 1989, the proposal was reconsidered, with New Delhi again chosen as the venue for the Games. The Games were then scheduled for 1991.

Presently, around 50,000 foreign and 500,000 domestic tourists visit Darjeeling each year, and its repute as the 'Queen of the Hills' remains unaltered. According to an India Today survey published on 23 December 2015, Darjeeling is the third most googled travel destination among all the tourist spots in India.|$|E

Many of these migrants were unskilled and uneducated, and became itinerant hawkers {{to earn a living}} with low operating costs, selling daily necessities such as food and clothing to those of the working classes. At that time, the economic condition in Hong Kong was low and working-class families were large, giving rise to 'family consumption'. These families bought their basic necessities from hawkers.|$|R

We provide evidence that economic growth, rapid urbanization and compelling demographics attract real estate investments and also confirm that lack of transparency in the legal framework, administrative burdens of doing real estate business, socio-cultural challenges and <b>political</b> <b>instabilities</b> of countries reduce international real estate allocations...|$|R
5|$|Assimilation efforts {{began as}} early as the 17th century with the arrival of French colonists in New France. They were {{resisted}} by Indigenous communities who were unwilling to leave their children for extended periods and who came to associate missionaries with the diseases devastating Indigenous populations. The establishment of day and boarding schools by groups including the Récollets, Jesuits and Ursulines was largely abandoned by the 1690s. The <b>political</b> <b>instability</b> and realities of colonial life also {{played a role in the}} decision to halt the education programs. An increase in orphaned and foundling colonial children limited church resources, and colonists benefited from favourable relations with Indigenous peoples in both the fur trade and military pursuits.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{however, the}} Argentine economy {{deteriorated}} notably. The {{single most important}} factor in this decline has been <b>political</b> <b>instability</b> since 1930, when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina {{was one of the most}} stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned into one of the most unstable. Despite this, up until 1962 the Argentine GDP per capita was higher than of Austria, Italy, Japan and of its former colonial master, Spain. Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self-sufficiency, but the government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production, which fell dramatically.|$|E

Petroleum prices rose dramatically, greatly benefiting Texas, particularly as compared {{to other parts of the}} U.S. that faced recession during this time. A new economic boom emerged which, though not as transformative as the early 1900s, pushed the population of Texas to the point that, by the end of the century, Texas was the second most populous state in the nation. Some sources, in fact, use the phrase Texas oil boom to refer to this later period rather than the earlier period that followed Spindletop.|$|E

Socioeconomic and infrastructure inequalities are also rampant among urban areas (Rana et al. 2017), further worsening the situation. Disaster risk management systems are still reactive, and local institutions are managing disasters on an ad hoc basis (Rana and Routray 2016).

Due to <b>political</b> <b>instabilities,</b> it may be difficult for a country such as the Democratic Republic of Congo to develop water treatment systems on a large scale.

5|$|From {{the start}} of Elizabeth's reign, it was {{expected}} that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers for her hand, she never married and was childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships, or that she knew herself to be infertile. She considered several suitors until she was about fifty. Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the choice of a husband might also provoke <b>political</b> <b>instability</b> or even insurrection.|$|E
