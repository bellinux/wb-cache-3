After Spain joined the First Coalition against Revolutionary France, Daoíz participated in the War of Roussillon, in the Pyrenees, from March 1794 but was captured in a French counterattack on 25 November 1794. He was held as a prisoner of war at Toulouse where he turned down an offer of freedom and a commission in the French Army, which was short of artillery officers. After the Peace of Basel ended the war between France and Spain on 22 July 1795, Daoíz was released and made his way back to El Puerto de Santa Maria.|$|E

In 2001, he was selected by the Giants {{in the first round}} of the draft. He did not pitch in 2002 because of surgery to remove a non-cancerous tumor from his back.

40|$|We examine <b>the</b> interannual {{variability}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seasonal mean {{atmospheric circulation}} in the Southern Hemisphere during austral winter.

REOF 2 displays a wave train, linked to the western North Pacific monsoon and the Pacific-Japan pattern in East Asia in the same season; REOF 3 resembles the Pacific-South American pattern. Externally forced variability strongly projects on both REOF 2 and REOF 3 so that in the ensemble mean, an atmospheric model with prescribed observed sea surface temperature captures considerable <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> evolution <b>of</b> REOF 2 (50 %) and REOF 3 (25 %), suggesting a potential predictability for the two modes...|$|R
40|$|Digital down {{conversion}} (DDC) is an algorithm, used {{to lower}} <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> samples per second by selecting a limited frequency band {{out of a}} stream of samples. A possible DDC algorithm consists of two simple cascading integrating comb (CIC) filters and a finite input response (FIR) filter preceded by a modulator that is controlled with a numeric controlled oscillator (NCO). Implementations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> algorithm have been made for five architectures, two application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), a general purpose processor (GPP), a {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA), and the Montium tile processor (TP). All architectures are functionally capable <b>of</b> performing <b>the</b> algorithm. The differences between the architectures are their performance, flexibility and energy consumption. In this paper, we compared <b>the</b> energy consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> architectures when performing the DDC algorithm. The ASIC is the best solution if digital down conversion is constantly required. When digital down conversion is needed only <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> Altera Cyclone II is the best solution due to its smaller technology size.
