5|$|During {{the early}} and mid-20th century, print and media became a noted {{industry}} in Ashford. The Headley Brothers, a <b>printing</b> <b>services</b> company, was founded in 1881 and by the mid-1950s printed and exported over 2 million books.

5|$|As he had as {{governor}} of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government. While serving on the Joint Committee on Printing during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government {{millions of dollars in}} printing costs by printing in volume and using recycled paper. In 1998, Virginia senator John Warner sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill would have eliminated the Joint Committee on Printing, distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the administrator of the Government Printing Office. It would also have centralized government <b>printing</b> <b>services</b> and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office and concerns about the erosion of copyright protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of Bill Clinton. Warner did not return to his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Printing in the next congress, Ford retired from the Senate, and the bill was not re-introduced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine how the personnel of the Unviversity of Oulu experienced a change in <b>print</b> <b>services.</b> The <b>print</b> <b>services</b> managed by the university were replaced with <b>print</b> <b>services</b> provided by an external service provider. The management of the university was interested to find out how satisfied the employees were with the new services, so a master’s thesis topic for studying the experiences of the personnel was announced. The service provider, Canon, was interested in the results of the research, too. Data for the study was collected with a user satisfaction questionnaire that was sent to the personnel in February 2015. The survey consisted of open ended and closed-ended questions. The research was a qualitative case study and the emphasis was on qualitative analysis of the open ended questions. The data collected from the closed questions was analysed quantitatively. The findings of the study revealed that the users were quite satisfied with the new <b>print</b> <b>services,</b> and that some of the new features were highly appreciated. However, a few relatively clear areas of dissatisfaction existed, too. This research contributed to science by adding knowledge about managed <b>print</b> <b>services,</b> and on a more detailed level, about how personnel of a university experienced a change from <b>print</b> <b>services</b> managed by the university to <b>print</b> <b>services</b> provided by an outside service provider. Also, a possible positive relationship between implementing a managed <b>print</b> <b>services</b> solution and user satisfaction was found. On a practical level the findings provided helpful information for the university and the service provider for improving the new <b>print</b> <b>services.</b> Also, this study contributed to the research of information systems success, user resistance and user satisfaction in the context of managed <b>print</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
