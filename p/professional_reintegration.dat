The role of the CIS, which can be met as a tool of professional activation of the group of the permanently unemployed residents, is being analysed. The article widely refers to the cooperation between the Municipality of Czestochowa and the Department of Housing “TBS ” Ltd. as well as its effect on the improvement in the housing outlook of socially excluded people, with simultaneous <b>professional</b> <b>reintegration</b> of this group of people.

Although the number of breast-cancer survivors is increasing, occupational reintegration is not a priority in medical treatment as the primary aim focuses on survival. Moreover, in existing rehabilitation programs, the main focus is on physical functioning. Social participation in daily life and <b>professional</b> <b>reintegration</b> often remain underrated. Contrary, both research results and clinical experience suggest that assisting these patients in their vocational rehabilitation will not only help them to stay employed but will subsequently increase their quality of life. <b>Professional</b> <b>reintegration</b> after breast cancer treatment remains a challenge for all those involved. Possible barriers are (1) the side-effects of the treatment and (2) the lack of support. The purpose of this research project is to develop Occupational Therapy (OT) intervention as a structural part of rehabilitation for breast cancer survivors by supporting their re-entry on the job. A systematic literature review will be presented. This systematic review examines existing evidence and research results regarding possible interventions to increase occupational functioning. A quantitative (and qualitative) evaluation study of an occupational therapy intervention, based upon consensus and best practice will be developed. Indeed, by interviewing and studying breast cancer survivors and including an expert-group consisting of members of existing rehabilitation teams, the necessary components should be detected. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} tenders and {{contracts}} {{is a crucial}} factor in {{the success or failure}} of the contracting-out of reintegration services. In a laboratory experiment with <b>professionals</b> from private <b>reintegration</b> service providers, we tested two tender designs. In the first design, the government announces a predetermined amount that will be paid for each employment outcome. Participants then bid an amount of money that they are prepared to pay to operate the contract. This auction resembles contracting in the Australian Job Network and the British Employment Zones. The second design is the lowest-reward auction. In this auction, the participants bid a reward. The lowest bid wins the contract, and the reward is then paid for each unit of effort. The lowest-reward auction is similar to the current tendering practice in the Netherlands. We find that an auction with a fixed reward per placement is more efficient, yields more effort from the winner, and results in higher welfare than an auction in which bidders compete on the basis of the reward per placement. We derive this conclusion from both our theoretical analysis and data from our laboratory experiment with professional bidders...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionBrain {{injuries}} generate real {{difficulties in}} social and <b>professional</b> <b>reintegration.</b> In response to these concerns, Units for Evaluation, Training and Social and Vocational Counselling (UEROS) have been developed. Our research aims at studying {{the evolution of the}} psychological processes and quality of life of individuals admitted in the UEROS-AQUITAINE long-term care in order to improve the understanding of the impact of participating in this program on social and <b>professional</b> <b>reintegration.</b> The objective of the current study, which constitutes a preliminary work of feasibility, is to compare subjects who participated in the neuropsychological section to subjects who participated in the professional section. MethodsTwo groups were established: a group met upon admission in the UEROS, in the neuropsychological section (PN, n= 6) and a group met in the professional section (PP, n= 9). The subjects completed generic scales relative to self-esteem, self-efficacy, depression, coping and a specific scale of quality of life in brain injury patients (QOLIBRI), at two time-points with a 3 -month interval. A mixed factorial ANOVA was used to compare values obtained by the groups at the 2 evaluation times. ResultsThere {{were no significant differences between}} PP and PN for self-esteem, self-efficacy and depression. However, PP presented a significant decrease in the “Degree of bothered” concerning quality of life, feelings and physical condition compared to PN. Among the strategies of coping, only the Research for instrumental social support was significantly more used by PP than by PN. DiscussionThe construction of an adequate project allows an improvement in certain dimensions of quality of life and encourages functional coping. By the latter, centred on the problem, the subjects appear to seize the support of the multidisciplinary team. This investment could also allow moving away from the pain, to overcome clumsiness and sensory difficulties, becoming then “less annoying”. This study intends to be followed by a longitudinal larger-scale research. It will allow specifying the links existing between psychological processes, quality of life and community integration...|$|E

The academic and practical significance of this endeavor consists in analyzing a transitional situation due to the failure of the legislator that remained unregulated and is likely to lead to a non-unitary interpretation and consequently to the flagrant damaging of the fundamental rights of police officers. Without wishing to be an exhaustive initiative, the present paper represents a review that highlights the doctrinal and jurisprudential implications of a conviction with conditional suspension of the custodial sentence, upon labor relations of the police officers...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{figures show}} {{that the number of}} {{permanent}} exclusions from Mainstream Secondary Schools (MSS) has increased to its highest rate in recent years (DfE, 2016 c), and research suggests that reintegration back into mainstream education for young people can be problematic (Wilkin et al, 2005). Outcomes for students excluded from school and placed in alternative provision, such as Pupil Referral Units (PRUs), include social isolation, unemployment, crime, and mental health problems (Hall-Lande et al, 2007; Ofsted, 2004). However, research has suggested that effective reintegration from PRUs back into mainstream education is able to help students to reconceptualise their behaviour and break the cycle of learned helplessness (Armstrong, 1999). As research has shown that permanent exclusions often follow numerous unsuccessful transitions throughout school (Trotman et al, 2015), the importance of ensuring an effective reintegration process back into mainstream school for these students is paramount. This research utilises Q methodology to explore the perspectives of 47 PRU and MSS <b>professionals</b> on effective <b>reintegration.</b> The data were analysed using inverted factor analysis (Stephenson, 1936), which produced three distinct viewpoints across both PRU and MSS professionals: 1. 	Collaborative Working and the Role of the PRU 2. 	Inclusive Practice, Availability of Resources and Support 3. 	Individualised Approaches and the Role of the School A thematic analysis was also undertaken on qualitative data, obtained through participants’ responses to post-sorting questionnaires, to identify perceived barriers to reintegration within the focus Local Authority. These were characterised as consistency; engagement and support; availability; attitudes and expectations; understanding; and communication. Consideration of both promotive factors and barriers to reintegration assisted with identifying implications for professional practice, relevant for both key stakeholders within the research and Educational Psychologists. This was undertaken with the view of enhancing reintegration processes within the focus Local Authority, and promoting the inclusion of students within mainstream schools...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Burn {{injury is}} a severe {{systemic}} disease with social implications. Aim: The recording of patient’s clinical profile with burn injury worldwide and in Greece, the outcome {{and impact of}} the injury on the patient’s mental health and social, professional and family life. Methods: There were collected surveys and reports concerned burn victims, men and women, teenagers and adults of all types and severities of burns {{in the world and}} in Greece. The information were been searched in database of Pubmed and websites of international health agencies (American Burn Association-ABA, World Health Organization-WHO, Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention-CDC) and statistical offices (Hellenic Statistical Authority), between the years 1985 - 2012. Results: In U. S. A. 183. 036 burned victims were reported between the years 2002 - 11 and in Greece 1840 in 1993 - 2001. The most of studies were showed strong relationship between risk of burn and age, gender, standard of living and education, the place and conditions of the injury, the lack of information and habits of patients. The coexistence of chronic diseases burdened the risk of injury and the outcome. After burn injury, patients had difficulties on <b>professional</b> and social <b>reintegration,</b> because of physical complications and mental disorders. Their psychological condition upon leaving the hospital was important prognostic feature. Researchers suggested the detection of high-risk groups to train them and organized psychosocial reintegration of burned. Conclusion: There is a reciprocal relationship between clinical profile of burned patients before injury and outcome of the disease and their mental health, social, professional and family life. The need for continuous investigation into the profile of burned within multicenter study and organization of network for psychosocial reintegration became evident...|$|R
40|$|We have seen, by {{the brief}} {{approach}} {{made to the}} historical evolution of the legal regime of accidents at work, that {{it was with the}} 83 Law, 24 th of July 1913 that the first legal regime appeared to repair the accidents at work and that the principle of its obligation came to be consecrated in the 5637 Decree, 10 th May 1919, being restated by the 1942 Law on 27 th July 1936, but it was only regulated by the 2127 Law on the 3 rd August 1965 with the 360 / 71 Decree-Law when it was really established and its obligation consecrated, always reiterated in the following diplomas: that the working accident insurance is regulated by its own diplomas and regular clauses; that with the evolution it expanded its obligation factor to the independent workers (100 / 97 Law) and it was regulated in a new security framework to the worker concerning <b>professional</b> rehabilitation and <b>reintegration,</b> (98 / 2009 Law). Belonging the accident insurance contract to the area of the responsibility insurance, {{in the evolution of the}} legislative thought we have nowadays this special objective kind of civil insurance based on the responsibility without the employer’s fault, related to the repairing of the damages caused by the working accident, it appeared by the exception to the extra-agreement civil responsibility; different from the insurance contract of the independent workers concerning the 3 th article of LAT 97 and the 155 / 99 Decree/Law, ensuring the same service provided in LAT, but not the transfer to the civil responsibility, as the insurance provider and insured person are the same, working the insurance as a modality of personal accidents suffered by the insured person connected to his own activity. Concerning its classification and duration we have already seen that it can be on his own or on someone’s else, temporary, pre- determined time limited to days or months and not temporary, one year and the following, automatic renewal at the end of the year; which in the qualification of business branches, the work accident insurance can be included in the Not-Life classification. In whatconcerns the contract of the work accident insurance, considering the agreement, we have already seen that the typical obligation of the insurance owner is to provide the service which results from a sinister associated to a certain risk, remaining this one in the legal field of the insured person; that the main obligation of insuranceowner is based on the secure pay, which is determined by the insured person, and calculated according to the responsibilities covered by insurance policy. Concerning its legal nature, the work accident insurance contract is a bilateral agreement, synallagmatic, onerous, aleatory, trustful, indemnifier, specific, personal, consequent, constant, typical and prolonged. The constituents are the insurance owner and the insured person, being this the employer. It was found that the work accident insurance can be effected in a fixed or variable prize modality, after being analyzed both and its different coverage. When making the contract, we have seen that being this kind of insurance compulsive, the relation of it results from the law itself, it is not allowed to both constituents to change or adjust the terms of the contract; that the basis of it are the assumption of risk and the payment of the prize; that the insurance contract is valid without any special observance, meaning that it’s only necessary the consensus between both sides, through a verbal, letter, fax or e-mail form, to make the contract valid and effective, despite the fact that the insurance policy is not yet issued, derogating the formal nature of the insurance contract foreseen by the 426 th article of the Commercial Code; that the consensual nature comes from the principle stated in the LRIC -Legal Regime of the Insurance Contract- 32 th article; that the law obliges the insurer to formalize the contract through a written document, a dated and signed insurance policy which should be sent to the insured person. It has been analyzed the relevance of the statements of the insured person when making the contract, in particular the insurance contract formalized in the way of holidays sheets according to the 429 th article of the Commercial Code, is currently revoked which should be understood in a restrictive sense whenever there is a compulsory insurance, when certain inaccuracies are performed in good faith by the employer, not putting at risk the validity and the effectiveness of the insurance, it has been verified that facing inadequate statements some demonstrations of the facts should be carried out or when hidden situations can influence over the existence of the conditions of the contract. Concerning the changes of the contract, we may conclude that such they will be registered in a document named as additional official record, making integrant part of the insurance policy and prevailing on the terms and initial conditions of the changing parts. Relatively to the qualification of the work accident insure contract as a contract in favour of others, we must follow the understanding of the majority of the case law to qualify it, by different reasons, particularly because it is qualified as an insurance of civil responsibility (138 th article nr 3 of the LRIC –Legal Regime of the Insurance Contract) adapting it to the work accident insurance the arrangements connected to the civil responsibility insurance not opposing the normal regime of work accident insurance (137 th and 148 th articles of the LRIC); as this is a compulsory civil responsibility insurance, of public interest, as a way to be insured the compensation to the victims, the contract is established in behalf of the injured workers and the only ones in this situation, of the injured third parties, holders of insurance interest, being not opposable to the existing relationships between the insurance owner and the employer; that the injured workers have the right to demand directly to the insurance owner, and only this one can solve any issues with the injured, his legal heirs or with the court the emerging situations from working accidents, in particular the obligation arising out of the contract, not being allowed that the parts by convention to change the general rule according to the compensation, avoiding that way the resolution of the contract after the accident; they have the right of direct action before the insurance owner, which cannot be avoided by contractual clause. It was checked that the right of the injured emerges from the law and that the damage is charged to the injured, that the right to repair comesfrom the contract and this is claimed to the insurance owner to whom was transferred the civil responsibility which remains in the legal area of the injured; right to be compensated with the partial repair of the salary which he is not receiving, with the exception of the convention over the total salary. Finally, it was checked that all the damages suffered are not granted by the worker under the agreement of the work accident insurance, in particular the non-patrimonial damages and the lost profits, as they are excluded from the compensation system of the working accidents, except to the cases which are attributed to the employer as guilt or malice, situation which can be provided by the Law in its 18 th article, nr 2, resultingfrom the particularity of this regime, different from the objective labour accident responsibility according to the general legal terms, which can be characterized by the worsening of the compensation amount and by the chargeback of the non-patrimonial damages. Out of this regime are all the accidents in which the employer is not to blame, so in certain situations, the worker is obliged to establish two different actions, one of labour nature and the other a civil law in order to get the possession of all his rights and the defense of all the damages suffered. The same cannot happen with the compulsory civil responsibility insurance of the car sector, in case of a car accident, for instance, that way no extra value would be added to the objective civil responsibility, as social function, so that the legislator could give the consequent equalization without the damage of the possible limitation of the consequent compensation and the moderator role which is up to the court, giving the consequent amount of money according to the 494 th and the 499 th articles of the Civil Code...|$|R
40|$|This study serves two purposes.

Second, this paper critically evaluates the issues relating to <b>professional</b> <b>reintegration</b> in which members may be barred from practising their trade when they are released from prison. Banning members from professional membership because of their ex-convict label represents a form of exclusionary stigma that contributes to stigmatic shaming and resentment towards the institutions that impose such penalties.

40|$|BACKGROUND: One {{increasingly}} attractive hypothesis {{to account}} for prolonged sickness absence from work {{is the presence of}} 'information asymmetry' among stakeholders. Information asymmetry refers to a situation in which critical information is not (appropriately) exchanged, in this case among those involved in disability management. AIM: The {{purpose of this study was}} to intervene positively in the information asymmetry that currently exists between social insurance physicians and occupational physicians in Belgium. METHODS: We developed a novel model aimed at improving information exchange, and a pilot study protocol based on the model. Our first objective was to investigate feasibility of implementing the study protocol. Our second and main objective was to obtain preliminary results on whether improving information exchange between physicians would facilitate work resumption of employees out on sickness absence. RESULTS: Of 126 patients recruited, 91 were eligible and assigned to one of two groups: a control group, whose physicians used the standard Belgian evaluation protocol, and an intervention group, whose physicians used our new protocol. Outcome parameters from the 15 patients assigned to the intervention group revealed that enhanced inter-physician information exchange produced favourable work resumption rates (73 %), suggesting that both the model and study protocol show promise. CONCLUSIONS: The issue of sharing information among all stakeholders involved in disability management is an important one. Moreover, <b>professional</b> <b>reintegration</b> of employees after a sickness absence is universally important to occupational health practitioners. Our preliminary results suggest that reducing information asymmetry among physicians should be investigated further in larger intervention trials. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Dysexecutive {{syndrome}} {{is one of}} the most frequent sequel of severe traumatic brain injury. It causes severe disabilities and it is incompletely assessed by the classical "paper and pencil" neuropsychological tests. We developed an ecological assessment conducted in a naturalistic situation, consisting of a cooking task, and we described a classification of errors. This assessment is very sensitive, even to a mild dysexecutive syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To describe the disabilities in activities of daily living of a traumatic brain-injured patient and to demonstrate the sensitivity of an ill-structured ecological assessment. METHOD: We report a single case study illustrating how the ecological assessment by the cooking task helped better understand and characterize the patient's disabilities. RESULTS: The patient presented severe disabilities in daily life activities, which were well described by his family. His cognitive disorders were mild in the cognitive tests, even those supposed to be more ecological, such as the Six Elements Task or script generation. He exhibited very severe disorders in the cooking task, with a very high number of errors. Moreover, duration of the cooking task was very long; he did not achieve the goal and exhibited dangerous behaviour. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The cooking task involves abilities to deal with multitasking, which particularly involve executive functions. The most severe disorders were observed during the patient's interaction with the environment while conducting a complex goal-directed action plan, indicating control disorders. This type of naturalistic assessment provides very useful information to help patients organise their familial, social or <b>professional</b> <b>reintegration...</b>|$|E

The use of the MBT physiotherapy devices in the recovery programme of the postural control after the cerebrovascular accident involves the need to set up an individualized programme of kinetic therapy. According to the established deficiency, namely the average one and the slight one, the recovery programme would need the introduction of techniques and methods whose effect is to reeducate the postural function.

40|$|AbstractPurpose. Today {{we live in}} an era {{of speed}} with a growing rate of accidents, {{especially}} traffic that is associated more frequently with complex trauma, in particular of lower limb, is within the classification of type III open fractures B / C. These injuries are often accompanied by great loss of tissue in the leg, requiring complex reconstructive surgery. Methods. I took the 158 study patients with complex lesions in the calf-ankle-foot defects were accompanied by significant loss of skin, muscle and bone, only those cases which required microsurgical reconstruction type. We selected and pursued these cases because of their severity, many of them to amputations limit, and trying to prove that the evolution of science by introducing microsurgery in orthopedics and emergency services can change the destiny of man, athlete or not. Results. Thus at the patient hospitalization, mean limb function made up 28. 36 ± 2 points for third proximal calf 24. 17 ± 2 points for the middle third leg, and 20. 12 ± 2 points for distal third leg. At 18 months postoperatively, in the group of patients overall result was satisfactory. The average score of function in proximal third of leg was made at 5. 09 ± 1 (p = 0. 029), middle third of - 5. 20 ± 1 (p = 0. 024) and distal third of leg - 6. 31 ± 1 (p = 0. 011). Distal third leg was more modest final results compared to the middle and the proximal, which is determined by placing lesions in close proximity to the joint talocrurale. Conclutions. Finally we can say that the assessment of lower limb functional disturbance shows that solving through reconstructive microsurgery techniques these serious cases with significant loss of tissue (skin, muscle, tendon, bone), leads not only to shorten hospitalization and reduce costs, but also a good psycho-social and <b>professional</b> <b>reintegration...</b>|$|E

Parte-se do princípio de que a pena carcerária é um mal que ainda se apresenta necessário, e para tanto não merece total extinção, mas sim significativas reformas. Toma-se como base dessa hipótese a desvinculação dos crimes que atingem bens jurídicos de maior relevância e propostas alternativas de encarceramento. Como fundamento, analisa-se os reflexos do encarceramento e suas diferentes propostas, enquanto medida indutora à reincidência, pretendendo sugerir propostas de modificação dos caminhos que provocam o sempre crescente índice de reincidência, embasando-se na participação da sociedade nos processos de reconstrução da dignidade profissional do apenado e do egresso.

Specifically, the focus of the research is directed toward those people who were condemned to imprisonment through long length sentences, due to have been accused and convicted of serious crimes against individuals, the social order and its security. The hypothesis raised here based upon careful empirical observations is that the State, alone, is weak and unprepared to cope with programs of re-socialization of these people; there is no serious academic and educational strategies directed to help them to reach dignity and professional and social respectability; nor have been introduced effective policies toward a professional training, or re-training, in order to integrate them in industrial or commercial activities. By contrast, what has happened is that prisons have frequently be transformed in a web of delinquence, tying, inside and outside the prisons, criminal leaders and their gangs. So, once they leave prison, (when and if they do) they are again engaged in different types of criminal actions. Objectively, this research tries to conceive a new and revolutionary project, on the basis of establishing agreements between state partners and private ones, concentrating both money, social services, and technologies, able to provide educational and professional means and efforts, not only in order to low the level of criminality, but mainly to create new and more effective alternatives to the prisoners to reach moral, social and <b>professional</b> <b>reintegration</b> within the community, as well as regain their citizenshi...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{epidemiological}} study of minor cervical spine trauma (frequently {{referred to as}} whiplash injury) {{based on data from}} the Comité Européen des Assurances (CEA) gathered in ten European countries. To determine the incidence and expenditure (e. g., for assessment, treatment or claims) for minor cervical spine injury in the participating countries. Controversy still surrounds the basis on which symptoms following minor cervical spine trauma may develop. In particular, there is considerable disagreement with regard to a possible contribution of psychosocial factors in determining outcome. The role of compensation is also a source of constant debate. The method followed here is the comparison of the data from different areas of interest (e. g., incidence of minor cervical spine trauma, percentage of minor cervical spine trauma in relationship to the incidence of bodily trauma, costs for assessment or claims) from ten European countries. Considerable differences exist regarding the incidence of minor cervical spine trauma and related costs in participating countries. France and Finland have the lowest and Great Britain the highest incidence of minor cervical spine trauma. The number of claims following minor cervical spine trauma in Switzerland is around the European average; however, Switzerland has the highest expenditure per claim at an average cost of € 35, 000. 00 compared to the European average of € 9, 000. 00. Furthermore, the mandatory accident insurance statistics in Switzerland show very large differences between German-speaking and French- or Italian-speaking parts of the country. In the latter the costs for minor cervical spine trauma expanded more than doubled in the period from 1990 to 2002, whereas in the German-speaking part they rose by a factor of five. All the countries participating in the study have a high standard of medical care. The differences in claims frequency and costs must therefore reflect a social phenomenon based on the different cultural attitudes and medical approach to the problem including diagnosis. In Switzerland, therefore, new ways must be found to try to resolve the problem. The claims treatment model known as “Case Management” represents a new approach in which accelerated social and <b>professional</b> <b>reintegration</b> of the injured party is attempted. The CEA study emphasizes the fundamental role of medicine in that it postulates a clear division between the role of the attending physician and the medical expert. It also draws attention to the need to train medical professionals in the insurance business {{to the extent that they}} can interact adequately with insurance professionals. The results of this study indicate that the usefulness of the criterion of so-called typical clinical symptoms, which is at present applied by the courts to determine natural causality and has long been under debate, is inappropriate and should be replaced by objective assessment (e. g. accident and biomechanical analysis). In addition, the legal concept of adequate causality should be interpreted in the same way in both third party liability and social security law, which is currently not the case...|$|E
