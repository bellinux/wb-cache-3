2500|$|In proof {{theory and}} set theory, {{there is an}} {{interest}} in finitistic consistency <b>proofs,</b> <b>that</b> is, consistency <b>proofs</b> <b>that</b> themselves are finitistically acceptable. Such a <b>proof</b> establishes <b>that</b> the consistency of a theory T implies the consistency of a theory S by producing a primitive recursive function that can transform any proof of an inconsistency from S into a proof of an inconsistency from T. [...] One sufficient condition for a consistency proof to be finitistic {{is the ability to}} formalize it in PRA. For example, many consistency results in set theory that are obtained by forcing can be recast as syntactic <b>proofs</b> <b>that</b> can be formalized in PRA.|$|R

5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} by Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc. as a hardcover in January 2010. It was noted as being well-researched and covering a significant breadth of academic fields.

5|$|According to unverified reports it is {{believed}} that St. Thaddeus was buried {{at the site of the}} St. Thaddeus Monastery in the 1st century A.D., and that St. Gregory was responsible for establishing a monastery here in the 4th century. However, there is recorded <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> St. Thaddeus Monastery dates to the 7th century. It was the second Armenian church to be built, following the Etchmiadzin Cathedral and was the seat of the diocese in the 10th century. It was destroyed in an earthquake in 1319 and was rebuilt due to the efforts of Bishop Zachariah in the 1320s.|$|E
