In addition zinc levels were determined in livers and kidneys from swine, and selenium and zinc levels were determined in the livers and kidneys from cattle. Depending on the element several methods of atomic absorption spectroscopy were used to analyze samples including flame, hydride generation, cold vapour generation and graphite furnace atomization. Analyses were also done by plasma emission spectroscopy. Levels of arsenic over 2. 0 micrograms/g were detected in 0. 9 % of swine livers and 0. 3 % of swine kidneys. Cadmium levels higher than 1. 0 micrograms/g were detected in 0. 3 % of cattle livers, 10. 8 % of cattle kidneys, 1. 8 % of swine kidneys, 0. 4 % of <b>poultry</b> <b>livers</b> and 0. 3 % of poultry kidneys.

40|$|Background: In October 2009, a dual-pathogen {{outbreak}} of Campylobacter and Salmonella occurred in which 59 cases were identified among guests attending a regional {{conference in the}} North of England. The mean symptomatic period was 5. 4 days (confidence intervals: 4. 4 - 6. 4), and over 84 % of the cases had abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was used to investigate the outbreak, and active case-finding was performed through the conference organizers and environmental health officers. A focused questionnaire was distributed to all guests via the event organizers 10 days after the conference. Results: Response rate among guests was 61 % (107 / 175). A cohort study was undertaken, and a strong association was found between illness and consumption of chicken liver pâté, supporting the hypothesis that chicken liver pâté was the most likely cause of the outbreak.

Thus, we evaluated the risk of infection due to the consumption of liver of chickens inoculated with different doses of embryonated T. canis eggs. Doses were 5 – 100 times smaller than the ones previously employed in this type of study. Groups of five chickens were inoculated with 5000 (control), 1000, 500, 300 or 50 eggs of T. canis, and at 72 h post-inoculation, the liver of each bird was consumed by a BALB/c receptor mouse. Forty-eight hours after consumption, we examined the organs and carcasses of the mice for larvae of T. canis. All mice were positive for larvae, except the group that consumed the chicken liver inoculated with 50 eggs. This group contained only one positive mouse, in which the larva was lodged in the brain. In mice that consumed livers of chickens inoculated with ≥ 300 eggs, larvae concentration was primarily in the liver and lungs, characterizing the initial phase of infection.

Population genetic analysis indicated that isolates from duck samples were typical of isolates from farmed poultry. Campylobacter spp. contamination of duck liver may present a hazard similar to the increasingly recognized contamination of chicken liver. Although bacteria in the genus Campylobacter commonly cause gastroenteritis, identified outbreaks are relatively rare. In England and Wales, 21 identified campylobacteriosis outbreaks during 1992 – 1994 (1) and 50 during 1995 – 1999 (2) accounted for 0. 2 % and 0. 4 % of reported outbreaks of gastroenteritis, respectively. Water and milk were the main sources of Campylobacter spp. outbreaks in the United Kingdom and the United States, although becoming less so (2, 3).

In the previous year there were 63 outbreaks of foodborne diseases (figure 1). The {{rise in the number}} of general outbreaks in 2011 could be due to the continued increase in outbreaks caused by Campylobacter spp (20 / 83 in 2011; 18 / 63 in 2010) and a rise in the outbreaks caused by Salmonella spp compared to the previous year (18 in 2011; 8 in 2010).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of the present experiments {{was to determine whether}} the levels of supplemental methionine sources currently used in practical diets exceed the capacity of the chick to convert the supplement to L-methionine. Supplemental sources examined included DL- 2 -hydroxy- 4 -(methylthio) butanoic acid (DL-HMB, Ahmet®, or MHA®) and DL-methionine (DL-Met). Two approaches were taken: first, the amount of enzyme activity available for conversion of the two supplemental methionine sources was determined using optimum reaction conditions for each and chick liver homogenate as the enzyme source. These experiments showed that total liver enzyme conversion activity was 564 umol/h for DL-HMB and 529 umol/h for DL-Met. The total activities for the two sources were not different when measured at saturating substrate concentration. Second, to address {{the question of whether the}} enzyme is limiting for either source under practical feeding conditions, birds were fed starter diets supplemented with DL-HMB or DL-Met at. 25 % of the diet for 3 wk. When hepatic levels of free HMB and methionine were determined, birds fed DL-HMB contained 7. 6 nmol HMB/g of liver and 84. 7 nmol methionine/g of liver. Birds fed DL-Met had levels of 7. 6 nmol HMB/ g liver and 80. 3 nmol methionine/g liver. These results indicate no accumula-tion of HMB or DL-Met, which might occur if conversion capacity were saturated. By calculation, a bird consuming 100 g/day of a diet supplemented with. 25 % activity would need to convert about 70 umol/h, indicating a sevenfold excess of enzyme in the liver alone. {Key words: DL- 2 -hydroxy- 4 -(methylthio) butanoic acid, methionine conversion, <b>poultry,</b> <b>liver,</b> Alimet®...|$|R

We aimed to evaluate the associations between moderate meat consumption and cardiovascular disease mortality. SUBJECTS/METHODS:We conducted a prospective cohort study of 51, 683 Japanese (20, 466 men and 31, 217 women) aged 40 - 79 years living in all of Japan (The Japan Collaborative Cohort Study; JACC Study). Consumptions of meat (beef, pork, <b>poultry,</b> <b>liver</b> and processed meat) were assessed via a food frequency questionnaire administrated at baseline survey. Hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality from cardiovascular disease were estimated from Cox proportional hazards regression models according to quintiles of meat consumption after adjustment for potential confounding variables. RESULTS:During 820, 076 person-years of follow-up, we documented 2685 deaths due to total cardiovascular disease including 537 ischemic heart diseases and 1209 strokes. The multivariable HRs (95 % confidence interval) for the highest versus lowest quintiles of meat consumption (77. 6 versus 10. 4 g/day) among men were 0. 66 (0. 45 - 0. 97) for ischemic heart disease, 1. 10 (0. 84 - 1. 43) for stroke and 1. 00 (0. 84 - 1. 20) for total cardiovascular disease. The corresponding HRs (59. 9 versus 7. 5 g/day) among women were 1. 22 (0. 81 - 1. 83), 0. 91 (0. 70 - 1. 19) and 1. 07 (0. 90 - 1. 28).

40|$|Cytochrome P 450 enzymes (CYP) are a {{group of}} monooxygenases able to biotransform several kinds of {{xenobiotics}} including aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), a highly toxic mycotoxin. These enzymes have been widely studied in humans and others mammals, {{but there is not}} enough information in commercial poultry species about their biochemical characteristics or substrate specificity. The aim {{of the present study was}} to identify CYPs from avian liver microsomes with the use of prototype substrates specific for human CYP enzymes and AFB 1. Biochemical characterization was carried out in vitro and biotransformation products were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Enzymatic constants were calculated and comparisons between turkey, duck, quail and chicken activities were done. The results demonstrate the presence of four avian ortholog enzyme activities possibly related with a CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 A 6 (activity not previously identified) and CYP 3 A 4 poultry orthologs, respectively. Large differences in enzyme kinetics specific for prototype substrates were found among the poultry species studied. Turkey liver microsomes had the highest affinity and catalytic rate for AFB 1 whereas chicken enzymes had the lowest affinity and catalytic rate for the same substrate. Quail and duck microsomes showed intermediate values. These results correlate well with the known in vivo sensitivity for AFB 1 except for the duck. A high correlation coefficient between 7 -ethoxyresorufin-Odeethylase (EROD) and 7 -methoxyresorufin- O-deethylase (MROD) activities was found in the four poultry species, suggesting that these two enzymatic activities might be carried out by the same enzyme.

United Kingdom drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. EFSA considers that the submitted supervised residue trials are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 3 mg/kg for the proposed uses on wheat (existing and new residue definition); for oats the MRL {{does not have to}} be modified for the existing residue definition, but needs to be raised to 3 mg/kg for the new residue definition. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of mepiquat in dry content commodities (oat and wheat) under consideration at the validated LOQ of 0. 05 mg/kg. For certain food commodities of animal origin the MRLs have to be modified as well.

In the last decade, these pathogens are becoming resistant to antibacterials, including vancomycin. Multidrug-resistant enterococci have been also isolated from agricultural animals in many countries worldwide, which raises concern of scientists because of possible horizontal transfer of resistance genes. Aim : To assess antibacterial sensitivity of Enterococcus spp. isolates collected from the poultry in the Russian Federation from 2013 to 2016, and to identify vancomycin-resistance genes in their genomes. Materials and methods : Eightyseven enterococci isolates belonging to E.   faecalis (n= 47, 54 %), E.   faecium (n= 25, 28. 7 %) and other species (n= 15, 17. 2 %) were collected from clinical samples of 297  heads of <b>poultry</b> (<b>liver,</b> lungs, heart, spleen, contents of the nasal and sinus cavities) from 17   poultry farms of the Northwest, Central, Volga, Ural and Southern Federal districts of the Russian Federation. Sensitivity of enterococci to antibacterials was determined by disk-diffusion and broth microdilution methods. Vancomycin resistance genes van was detected by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers. Results : Most enterococci isolates were resistant to erythromycin (74 / 87, 85. 1 %), gentamicin (70 / 87, 80. 5 %), ceftriaxone (61 / 87, 70. 1 %), ciprofloxacin (56 / 87, 64. 4 %), tetracycline (57 / 87, 65. 5 %), and rifampicin (48 / 87, 55. 2 %), fewer ones to trimethoprim (38 / 87, 43. 7 %), ampicillin (28 / 87, 32. 2 %), linezolid (15 / 87, 17. 2 %) and chloramphenicol (5 / 87, 5. 7 %). The vanC type genes (vanC 1 and vanC 2 / 3) were identified in 10   isolates. Vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentrations for these isolates were 2 to 8   mg/L. E.  faecium with vanC 1 gene was isolated from poultry probably for the first time ever.

Poultry and eggs are {{a major source of}} protein, but if contaminated by heavy metals, have the potential to lead to detrimental effects on human health. Objectives. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine chromium concentrations in poultry meat (flesh and liver) and eggs collected from poultry farms in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to calculate the daily intake of chromium from the consumption of poultry meat and eggs for adults, and to evaluate their potential health risk by calculating the target hazard quotients (THQ). Methods. All samples of poultry feed, meat (flesh and liver) and eggs were analyzed by a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) (GFA- EX- 7 i Shimadju, Japan). Results. Chromium concentrations were recorded in the range of not detected (ND) to 1. 3926 ± 0. 0010 mg kg− 1 and 0. 0678 ± 0. 0001 mg kg− 1 to 1. 3764 ± 0. 0009 mg kg− 1 in the liver of broiler and layer chickens, respectively. Chromium concentrations were determined in the range of 0. 069 ± 1. 0004 mgkg− 1 to 2. 0746 ± 0. 0021 mg kg− 1 and 0. 0362 ± 0. 0002 mg kg− 1 to 1. 2752 ± 0. 0014 mg kg− 1 in the flesh of broiler and layer chicken, respectively. The mean concentration of chromium in eggs was 0. 2174 − 1. 08 mg kg. − 1 The highest concentration of chromium 2. 4196 ± 0. 0019 mg kg− 1 was found in egg yolk. Target hazard quotients values in all <b>poultry</b> flesh, <b>liver</b> and eggs samples were less than one, indicating no potential health risks to consumers. Conclusions. The estimated daily intake values of chromium were below the threshold limit. Thus, our results indicate that no adverse health effects are expected as a resultof ingestion of chicken fed with tannery waste. Competing Interests.
