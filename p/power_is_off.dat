25|$|Independent of {{the host}} computer, a {{hardware}} device might have embedded firmware to control its operation. Firmware is used when the computer program is rarely or never expected to change, or when the program must not be lost when the <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
50|$|As the HP-41C had {{permanent}} memory (user programs and {{data were not}} wiped out when <b>power</b> <b>was</b> <b>off)</b> there <b>was</b> no absolute need for a permanent storage device, so the card reader was optional.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{alarm bells}} {{are divided into}} two categories: {{vibrating}}, and single-stroke. On a vibrating bell, the bell will ring continuously until the <b>power</b> <b>is</b> cut <b>off.</b> When <b>power</b> <b>is</b> supplied to a single-stroke bell, the bell will ring once and then stop. It will not ring again until <b>power</b> <b>is</b> turned <b>off</b> and on again. These were frequently used with coded pull stations.|$|R
50|$|The {{instruction}} cycle is repeated continuously until the <b>power</b> <b>is</b> turned <b>off.</b>|$|R

50|$|A Korean {{business}} man jumped in panic from his second floor {{hotel room and}} was hurt in the fall. He {{was brought to the}} hospital where he had to wait a long time for any help as <b>power</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> and most staff off duty (as that day was a public holiday).|$|R
60|$|No advance {{was made}} and the tableau was dramatic. Smith watched his press with {{undivided}} attention and it clattered away at full speed until the frail building shook with its powerful, steady motion. Then suddenly it began to slow down. The <b>power</b> <b>was</b> <b>off,</b> and the machine {{came to an abrupt}} stop.|$|R
50|$|On February 14, 2016, the {{temperature}} dropped to -20 F. The {{high for the}} day was -18 F. There was insufficient snow to insulate homes against the cold. Electric <b>power</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> for 12 hours, jeopardizing lives of residents, particularly the elderly, for electrical fired furnaces. Electrical generators kept outside could not be started due to the cold.|$|R
50|$|Independent of {{the host}} computer, a {{hardware}} device might have embedded firmware to control its operation. Firmware is used when the computer program is rarely or never expected to change, or when the program must not be lost when the <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
50|$|The term {{duty cycle}} {{describes}} {{the proportion of}} 'on' time to the regular interval or 'period' of time; a low duty cycle corresponds to low power, because the <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>off</b> {{for most of the}} time. Duty cycle is expressed in percent, 100% being fully on.|$|E
5000|$|Access {{and change}} BIOS {{settings}} remotely. This feature is available even if PC <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>off,</b> the OS is down, or hardware has failed. This feature {{is designed to}} allow remote updates and corrections of configuration settings. This feature supports full BIOS updates, not just changes to specific settings.|$|E
25|$|On 18 July, floods wrecked {{homes in}} Closeburn, <b>power</b> <b>was</b> cut <b>off</b> at Eaglesfield, and roads were closed at Moffat and Lochmaben.|$|R
50|$|Current {{was passed}} through Kemmler for 17 seconds. The <b>power</b> <b>was</b> turned <b>off</b> and Kemmler <b>was</b> {{declared}} dead by Edward Charles Spitzka.|$|R

50|$|The main {{microprocessor}} in the Chroma and Expander is a 68B09, {{and it has}} {{a computer}} interface consisting of a 25-pin D-sub connector. The factory original Chroma CPU board has 2 AA batteries to preserve memory while the <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>off.</b> Many Chroma CPU boards have been damaged from battery leakage.|$|E
5000|$|Intel Active Management Technology (Intel AMT), {{a set of}} {{hardware-based}} features {{targeted at}} businesses, allow remote access to the PC for management and security tasks, when an OS is down or PC <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>off.</b> Note that AMT {{is not the same}} as Intel vPro; AMT is only one element of a vPro PC.|$|E
50|$|Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) is {{hardware-based}} technology {{built into}} PCs with Intel vPro technology. AMT {{is designed to}} help sys-admins remotely manage and secure PCs out-of-band when PC <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>off,</b> the operating system (OS) is unavailable (hung, crashed, corrupted, missing), software management agents are missing, or hardware (such as a hard disk drive or memory) has failed.|$|E
50|$|That is {{the time}} {{constant}} of the free energy relaxation of the chamber's field (exponential decay) if the input <b>power</b> <b>is</b> switched <b>off.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Digital clocks {{that run}} on mains {{electricity}} and have no battery must be reset every time the <b>power</b> <b>is</b> cut <b>off</b> or if they are moved. Even if <b>power</b> <b>is</b> cut <b>off</b> for a second, most clocks will {{still have to be}} reset. This is a particular problem with alarm clocks that have no [...] "battery" [...] backup, because even a very brief power outage during the night usually results in the clock failing to trigger the alarm in the morning.|$|R
25|$|For {{many years}} after the 1986 Chernobyl {{disaster}} nuclear <b>power</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> the policy agenda in most countries. In recent years, intense public relations activities by the nuclear industry, increasing evidence of climate change and failures to address it, have brought nuclear power issues back {{to the forefront of}} policy discussion in the nuclear renaissance countries. But some countries are not prepared to expand nuclear <b>power</b> and <b>are</b> still divesting themselves of their nuclear legacy, through nuclear power phase-out legislation.|$|R
50|$|Those {{who have}} access to {{electricity}} received on average 10 hours of electricity a day, with disparities among the areas covered. People have freezers and refrigerators to cool food, not to preserve it. These coolers consume too much electricity to run off batteries, for those who can afford them. Therefore, they are disconnected when the <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Nonvolatile BIOS memory {{refers to}} a small memory on PC {{motherboards}} {{that is used to}} store BIOS settings. It is traditionally called CMOS RAM because it uses a volatile, low-power complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) SRAM (such as the Motorola MC146818 or similar) powered by a small [...] "CMOS" [...] battery when system and standby <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>off.</b> The typical NVRAM capacity is 256 bytes.|$|E
50|$|RTCs {{often have}} an {{alternate}} source of power, {{so they can}} continue to keep time while the primary source of <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>off</b> or unavailable. This alternate source of power is normally a lithium battery in older systems, but some newer systems use a supercapacitor, because they are rechargeable and can be soldered. The alternate power source can also supply power to battery backed RAM.|$|E
25|$|Microwaves {{generated}} in microwave ovens {{cease to exist}} once the electrical <b>power</b> <b>is</b> turned <b>off.</b> They do not remain in the food when the <b>power</b> <b>is</b> turned <b>off,</b> any more than light from an electric lamp remains in the walls and furnishings of a room when the lamp <b>is</b> turned <b>off.</b> They do not make the food or the oven radioactive. Compared to conventional cooking, the nutritional content of some foods may be altered differently, but generally {{in a positive way}} by preserving more micronutrients - see above. There is no indication of detrimental health issues associated with microwaved food.|$|R
5000|$|Gentlemen, I {{have nothing}} to say for nor against Villains, until the Day of Tryal, and then it is not in my <b>Power</b> to <b>be</b> <b>off</b> from hanging them." ...|$|R
50|$|Flash {{memory is}} non-volatile, {{retaining}} its contents {{even when the}} <b>power</b> <b>is</b> switched <b>off.</b> It can <b>be</b> erased and reprogrammed as required. This makes it useful for PLD memory.|$|R
50|$|Laptops with Intel vPro {{technology}} have hardware features that allow a system administrator to remotely access wired and wireless laptops for maintenance and servicing if {{the operating system}} is unresponsive or crashed and, when a laptop is connected to AC power (not on battery power), allow a sys-admin to remotely access the laptop when the system is asleep or laptop <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>off.</b> It is targeted more for businesses than consumers.|$|E
5000|$|Around 21:15 the {{navigator}} {{stated that}} the distance to Maputo was 60 km. Over the next few minutes, there were several comments from the crew indicating that they believed the navigational aids at Maputo were unavailable: the captain stated that [...] "there is no Maputo" [...] and [...] "electrical <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>off,</b> chaps!", while the navigator reported that the Instrument Landing System (ILS) and Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) were switched off and that the non-directional beacons (NDBs) were not working.|$|E
5000|$|A typical {{platform}} {{includes both}} a lower-performance integrated graphics processor by Intel and a high-performance one by Nvidia. Optimus saves battery life by automatically switching {{the power of}} the discrete graphics processing unit (GPU) off when it is not needed and switching it on when needed again. The technology mainly targets mobile PCs such as notebooks. When the GPU <b>power</b> <b>is</b> <b>off,</b> the driver redirects graphics commands to the integrated graphics chip. The switching is designed to be completely seamless and to happen [...] "behind the scenes".|$|E
50|$|Eddy current brakes {{are used}} to slow {{high-speed}} trains and roller coasters, to stop powered tools quickly when <b>power</b> <b>is</b> turned <b>off,</b> and in electric meters used by electric utilities.|$|R

25|$|For {{many years}} after the 1986 Chernobyl {{disaster}} nuclear <b>power</b> <b>was</b> <b>off</b> the policy agenda in most countries, and the anti-nuclear power movement seemed to have won its case. Some anti-nuclear groups disbanded. In the 2000s (decade), however, following public relations activities by the nuclear industry, advances in nuclear reactor designs, and concerns about climate change, nuclear power issues came back into energy policy discussions in some countries. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster subsequently undermined the nuclear power industry's proposed come back.|$|R
