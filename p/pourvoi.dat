50|$|Not {{all matters}} can be appealed and thus some cannot be re-judged on appeal, {{for example the}} least {{important}} litigation. In this case the <b>pourvoi</b> en cassation remains possible.|$|E
50|$|The Court can affirm a {{decision}} from below by dismissing the appeal (rejet du <b>pourvoi)</b> or overturn or amend {{the decision by}} allowing the appeal (accueil du <b>pourvoi).</b> If it finds that the lower court erred, it sets aside the lower court decision and remits the case with its opinion to an appellate court for reconsideration (cassation avec renvoi). If {{only a portion of}} a ruling is overturned, it is called cassation partielle, or partial setting aside. Sometimes, the Court may overturn a lower court ruling and judge the case ex proprio motu without being petitioned (cassation sans renvoi), as long as the merits and facts of the case are on record.|$|E
5000|$|Where no appeal {{has been}} made but the {{government}} disagrees with the lower court's interpretation of the law, it may order the Chief Prosecutor to [...] "lay an appeal before the Court {{in the interest of}} law" [...] (former un <b>pourvoi</b> dans l'intérêt de la loi), i.e., appeal to certify a question of general public importance. The Chief Prosecutor may do so sua sponte or at the Court's behest in either civil or criminal cases. The Court will then issue an advisory opinion which has no bearing on the lower court's ruling since it was satisfactory to all parties involved and no motion was made to appeal. If the government is dissatisfied with the law as stated by the courts, it may ask Parliament to rewrite the law, as long as no constitutional issue is involved.|$|E
