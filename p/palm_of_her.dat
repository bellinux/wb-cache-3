25|$|In 1440, {{the poet}} Kabir was also {{said to have}} been born of a virgin widow (a Hindu), through the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand. Like Karna, Kabir was sent down the river in a basket; he was found and adopted by a family of Muslim weavers, downstream. This (presumably posthumous) account—which depicts Kabir as {{secretly}} descended from Hindus—was intended to legitimise Kabir's religious authority {{in the eyes of the}} Hindu population who venerated his works. This story is absent from Muslim and Sikh accounts of Kabir's work.|$|E
25|$|Pathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's {{forensic}} science institute, performed the autopsy on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises {{and a couple}} of insubstantial cuts on the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand. Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with a hand being clamped over her mouth and nose. Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's {{forensic science}} institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.|$|E
25|$|The ghost floats, footless {{and with}} arms bent {{up at the}} elbows as is {{customary}} for ghost images of the period, in flames above a grassy field. Her head is framed by pine boughs. She stares off to the right, her gaze following her outstretched right arm. Covering the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right hand is a blue cloth on top of which rests a rolled up kakemono or makimono scroll. In her left hand she grasps a red cloth—possibly a furoshiki—which is tied up as a round, flat parcel. Peaking out over her right shoulder is the brown feathered fletching of a single arrow.|$|E

25|$|Surmounted on {{the main}} altar is a {{beautiful}} statue of St. Lucy holding up {{her eyes on the}} <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand. The exquisite stained glass windows when lit by sunlight create a panorama of colour further enhancing the transepts of the church. In a far corner of the church is a circular Baptismal Font of white marble carved with cherubs, and crowned by a statue of John the Baptist. On going up the narrow staircase that leads to the choir loft, one encounters 'Anthony Thomas', an enormous bell weighing 4300lbs. The bell has intricate engravings of elaborate floral wreaths and holy figures and symbols of Christianity, and it is the largest of the four bells shipped from Marseilles and christened at the cathedral in 1903. The choir loft also contains a unique pipe organ donated to the cathedral in 1934.|$|E
25|$|Antony and Cleopatra {{was never}} {{intended}} to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could not live without the other, it does not take much to be able {{to point out that the}} basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he never believed their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands, to always be in control of his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he was sad or fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.|$|E
500|$|Farmiga {{portrayed the}} lead role of Kate Coleman in Jaume Collet-Serra's {{psychological}} thriller Orphan (2009). Farmiga's performance was praised, with Toby Young of The Times writing that she [...] "becomes more convincing as the story unfolds. By the end, she has you in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand". She then appeared as Aurora de Valday in Niki Caro's romantic drama A Heavenly Vintage, which premiered at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival under the title The Vintner's Luck.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, 'Dolphus, no," [...] replied his wife. [...] "I'm quite myself." [...] With that, {{settling}} her hair, {{and pressing}} the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands upon her eyes, she laughed again.|$|R

500|$|Ono's final {{album of}} the 1980s was Starpeace, a concept album that she {{intended}} {{as an antidote to}} Ronald Reagan's [...] "Star Wars" [...] missile defense system. On the cover, a warm, smiling Ono holds the Earth in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand. Starpeace became Ono's most successful non-Lennon effort. [...] The single [...] "Hell in Paradise" [...] was a hit, reaching No. 16 on the US dance charts and No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the video, directed by Zbigniew Rybczyński received major airplay on MTV and won [...] "Most Innovative Video" [...] at Billboard Music Video Awards in 1986. In 1986, Ono set out on a goodwill world tour for Starpeace, primarily visiting Eastern European countries.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} drafts of the script, there were [...] "so many copies of people {{running around the}} place" [...] which made the story too confusing, so Graham and the {{production}} crew worked {{to make it more}} rational. The episode also contains a subplot in which Rory helps and protects Jennifer as she is scared and affected by the Gangers, which proved a twist in Amy and Rory's relationship. Karen Gillan enjoyed the twist. Amy had previously always had Rory [...] "in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand" [...] and a different side of the character was shown as she experienced the same emotions Rory felt when she seemed interested in the Doctor. Arthur Darvill also thought it gave Rory a chance to [...] "man up" [...] and be a hero by protecting someone.|$|E

[...] Strongly identified with her native state, she held a prominent place in Idaho cultural life.|$|E
60|$|She {{positively}} snorted with indignation; she {{had rolled}} her handkerchief into a ball, and nervously dabbed the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands with it. 'I followed you this afternoon, and I saw {{you go into}} that 'ouse with that low woman. What now? Eh?' She spoke with the greatest possible emphasis.|$|R
6000|$|We read of {{the dead}} body of Jezebel being devoured by the dogs of Jezreel, so that no man might say, [...] "This is Jezebel," [...] and that the dogs left only <b>her</b> skull, the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands, and the soles <b>of</b> <b>her</b> feet; but the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> the hands and the soles of the feet are the very remains by which a corpse might be most surely identified, if {{impressions}} of them, made during life, were available.|$|R

2500|$|Nik Wallenda has {{produced}} a variety of large-scale productions for amusement parks and similar venues in several countries. [...] The acts often feature him alongside family members, especially his wife Erendira. [...] Wallenda's children are sometimes part of the act. [...] His youngest child, Evita, has been performing balancing feats since she would balance in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father's hand at six months old. [...] Wallenda's shows have incorporated water and diving feats, the Wheel of Death, incline motorcycles, aerial silk and hoop, the globe of death, {{and of course the}} high-wire. [...] "We've performed nearly every circus or daredevil skill there is," [...] claims Wallenda. [...] "I like to mix it up", he says. [...] "It keeps [...] on our toes and gives the public something new to see every year." [...] Wallenda's father, Terry Troffer, serves as his safety coordinator, having retired from acrobatics after 36 years in the business. [...] Troffer's brother Mike serves as chief engineer. [...] Wallenda has never had a serious accident, describing the worst injury of his life as a broken toe while playing football.|$|E
2500|$|Less {{than four}} months after her July 2012 injury {{on the set of}} The Good Wife, Chenoweth {{returned}} to the concert stage for a short series of dates in California, where she performed [...] "a sagely programmed 90-minute set, which merged pop, Broadway, gospel and country with perky, unforced-feeling remarks. ... Chenoweth’s range, timbre and versatility are in peak form, with astonishing top notes, equalized registers and a delicious ability to variegate attack from number to number." [...] In 2013, Chenoweth performed at the Sydney Opera House as part of an Australian concert tour. In 2014, Chenoweth returned to Carnegie Hall with an autobiographical concert, where she sang [...] "as good a rendition of Much More' as we're ever likely to hear". She also made her London solo concert debut at the Royal Albert Hall, where a reviewer's five-star review noted: [...] "Chenoweth undeniably knows how to engulf a venue, not only with her (sometimes surprisingly) powerful, operatic voice ... but also with her irresistible ... personality ... that audience was in the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands {{for the duration of the}} evening". She joined Andrew Lippa in his oratorio I Am Harvey Milk at Avery Fisher Hall on October 6, 2014.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012, [...] "End of Time" [...] was {{the opening}} song of Knowles revue show [...] held in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States' {{entertainment}} resort, hotel, casino and spa, Revel. She {{was wearing a}} glimmering silver outfit and pink shoes designed by Ralph and Russo. According to Chuck Darrow of The Philadelphia Inquirer, [...] "Among the most stunning examples of the optical wizardry were the blue-and-white columns of light that framed the curtain-raising 'End of Time'". During {{the beginning of the}} show, Knowles asked the crowd to stand up on their feet, and according to Caryn Ganz of Spin magazine, [...] "quickly demonstrated her voice and hips are as limber as ever". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice reviewed the performance positively, saying: [...] "The night started off with 'End Of Time,' the militaristic yet ethereal paean to fidelity off her most recent album, 4. 'Say you'll never let me go,' a choir commands over a triple-time drumbeat, and as far as opening statements are concerned it was a convincing one; the small size of the venue and exclusivity of the gig... also helped, as much of this audience was ready to eat out of the <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand." [...] A writer of Black Entertainment Television noted, [...] "She dazzled fans with an assortment of high-energy performances of her upbeat hits like... 'End of Time.'" [...] On February 3, 2013, Knowles performed the song during the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show. She also performed [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", [...] "Halo" [...] and [...] "Bootylicious".|$|E

25|$|Julia Pastrana (1834–1860) {{travelled}} {{throughout the}} United States in a freak show as the bearded lady, capturing {{the attention of}} many artists. She is portrayed as having dark extensive hairs distributed equally throughout the surface <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body, even on the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands. Originally, she was believed to have congenital hypertrichosis lanuginosa; however, the generalized form of the syndrome coupled with her gingival hyperplasia indicated that her condition was congenital terminal hypertrichosis.
