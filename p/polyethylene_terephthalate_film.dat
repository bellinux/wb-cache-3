Celestion were the first manufacturers to fabricate dome tweeters out of a metal, copper. Nowadays other metals such as aluminium, titanium, magnesium, and beryllium, as well as various alloys thereof, are used, being both light and stiff but having low damping; their resonant modes occur above 20 kHz. More exotic materials, such as synthetic diamond, are also being used for their extreme stiffness. <b>Polyethylene</b> <b>terephthalate</b> <b>film</b> and woven silk suffer less ringing, but {{are not nearly as}} stiff, which can limit their very high frequency output.|$|E

The hydrolization of <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> <b>film</b> was primarily performed with sodium hydroxide aque-ous solution {{to produce a}} carboxyl-enriched surface. The multilayer films were fabricated by the alternate adsorption of the oppositely charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and silver nanoparticles on poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate. The assembly process was monitored by UV–VIS spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma. The surface topography and chemical composition of the self-assembly films was characterized by atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The images indicated that the silver nanoparticles were successfully assembled and well distributed on the substrate. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of metallic silver on the poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate. The thermal properties of the multilayer films were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic mechanical analyser. The results revealed that the storage modulus of ten-bilayer films decreases with temperature increasing and the glass transition temperature of ten-bilayer films {{have been found to}} be 99. 3 C, whereas it is 94. 8 C for the original <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> <b>film...</b>|$|E

30|$|Because TOCN {{elements}} form dense {{films with}} plywood-like nanolayered structures [53], not only TOCN self-standing films but also TOCN-coated PLLA and <b>poly(ethylene</b> <b>terephthalate)</b> <b>films</b> have high oxygen-barrier properties under dry conditions [52, 54, 55]. These close-packed structures of TOCN {{elements in the}} layers likely originate from strong electrostatic repulsion between anionically charged TOCN elements, which may work efficiently {{not only in the}} aqueous dispersion state but also during the drying process of water evaporation. However, the low oxygen permeabilities of the TOCN-COONa films and layers remarkably increase with RH due to the hydrophilic nature of TOCN-COONa type structures, {{which is one of the}} shortcomings of TOCN films and layers used as gas-barrier materials [54].|$|R

When the H 2 sensor, composed of Pd-coated ITO (indium tin oxide) and PET (<b>polyethylene</b> <b>Terephthalate)</b> <b>film,</b> is exposed to H 2, its output voltage is varied in proportion to H 2 concentration because the work function (WF) of Pd-coated surface changes, altering triboelectric charging behavior.
