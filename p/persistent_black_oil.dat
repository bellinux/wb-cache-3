50|$|The crew of a French {{salvage ship}} {{trying to raise}} a World War II-era {{submarine}} from the sea floor are stricken with massive radiation burns—except for one man, who has been infected with a parasitic <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> discovered on the submarine. The <b>black</b> <b>oil,</b> controlling the crewman's body, passes into the crewman's wife and uses her to travel to Hong Kong {{in pursuit of a}} middleman selling government secrets. Mulder is after the same man. After Mulder catches Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) in Hong Kong, the <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> passes itself to Krycek. Scully determines that the submarine had been involved in discovering the <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> escapes his body to board the craft.

She concludes that he may have had some {{immunity}} to the <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> because he is a Huecha Indian, or an indigenous Mexican national. Doggett and Mulder find proof of <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> on the platform and quarantine it, but de la Cruz's friend Diego Garza is missing. Ortega threatens to bring back the crew unless the agents can provide proof of an infection. Doggett and Mulder search for Garza who, like de la Cruz, also has Native American heritage. Mulder and Doggett later discover that somebody has set fire to the communications room. As the agents tackle the fire, Garza attacks Doggett and renders him unconscious. When he awakens, Garza, now mentally unstable, cuts his arm to check for the presence of <b>black</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{conventional}} PVT {{properties for}} the reservoir fluids <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> type are solution gas–oil ratio, Rs; oil formation volume factor, Bo; and gas formation volume factor, Bg. According to Fattah et al. (2009), {{the difference between}} the modified <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> (MBO) PVT properties and the conventional <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> PVT properties are in the handling of the liquid in the gas phase, the oil–gas ratio, Rv. The MBO approach supposes that the composition of stock tank liquid can exist in both of the liquid and gas phases at reservoir conditions. The liquid content of the gas phase was assumed to be defined as a function of pressure named vaporized oil–gas ratio, Rv. It is similar to the solution gas–oil ratio, Rs, which is used to describe how much gas is dissolved in the liquid phase. The MBO properties or extended <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> was introduced for the first time by Spivak and Dixon (1973).|$|R

5000|$|In season three the <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> was introduced, {{which was}} an alien {{creature}} which invaded bodies and made them into living hosts. The <b>Black</b> <b>oil</b> was able to enter through a victim's mouth, eyes or nose; it would leave a victim's body {{to get back to}} its original form or get a new host. Later on in the show's mythology, it is discovered that the <b>Black</b> <b>oil</b> is the Colonists' lifeform; the oil was brought to Earth by meteorites to create hosts of the human population living there. The season four two-parters [...] "Tunguska" [...] and [...] "Terma" [...] hit the writers when they were trying to conceive a big and fun canvas to tell stories. So they decided to create a story which had connections to the Russian gulags, which led to a [...] "natural" [...] idea that the Russians were experimenting separately from the Syndicate to create a vaccine for the <b>Black</b> <b>oil.</b> Shiban felt it was natural creating an arms race-like story between the United States and Russia, being that the Cold War had ended a few years earlier.|$|R

5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and corky materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|R
40|$|In {{petroleum}} reservoir management, {{the essence}} of well placement is to develop and maintain reservoir pressure {{in order to achieve}} maximum production for economic benefits. Large production can be achieved with the placement of multiple wells but this approach is capital intensive and inefficient {{for the development of a}} reservoir. A preferable option is the optimal placement of production and injection wells so as to fully capitalize on the imbedded hydrocarbons at a relatively decreased capital investment. The aim of this study is to use developed algorithm and a <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> simulator to place wells in the zones for optimal recovery in the reservoir. Optimal production was determined out of eight scenarios created from well placement in a hypothetical reservoir (finch reservoir) using a <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> simulator, alongside an algorithm developed with java for determining the best possible locations for well placement, taking into consideration the reservoir permeability, fluid saturation, and pay zone thickness. The results of this study reveal that well placement using the engineering judgment coupled with the application of the algorithm using a <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> simulator results in better production compared to other scenarios which consider the combined effect of algorithm and <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> simulator alone...|$|R

5000|$|Seed feeders are {{the most}} common type of feeders. They can vary in design from tubes to hoppers and trays. Sunflower seeds or mixed seeds are popular for use in these feeders and will attract many songbirds such as cardinals, finches, and chickadees. <b>Black</b> <b>oil</b> {{sunflower}} seeds are especially popular with bird enthusiasts. The outer shell of the <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> sunflower seeds are thinner and easier to crack than other types of sunflower seeds. In addition, the kernel is larger than the striped or white sunflower seeds. <b>Black</b> <b>Oil</b> Sunflower seeds also contain a large amount of fat; therefore they are especially good to use in the winter.

40|$|AbstractGas {{condensate}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} different fluids in reservoir simulation due to retrograde condensation in case of pressure reduction. In this kind of fluids, two phenomena named negative inertia and positive coupling, become significant in the high velocity zone around the wellbore. In this study, a modified <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> simulator is developed that take into account the velocity dependent relative permeability. Against the industrial simulator that assumes linear variation of transmissibilities by pressure, modified <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> nonlinear equations are solved directly without linearization. The developed code is validated by ECLIPSE simulator. The behavior of two real gas condensate fluids, a lean and a rich one, are compared with each other. For each fluid, simulations of PVT experiments are carried out to calculate <b>black</b> <b>oil</b> property applying Coats approach for gas condensate fluids. For both fluids, the proposed models for gas condensate velocity dependent relative permeability show different influence of velocity on relative permeability in the same conditions. Moreover, it is observed that higher flow rate of gas production leads to more condensate production during constant rate well testing...|$|R
