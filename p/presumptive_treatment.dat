5000|$|Intestinal parasites are a {{major health}} problem for many groups, {{including}} refugees, {{and the presence of}} pathogenic parasites requires medical attention. [...] "Over one billion persons worldwide are estimated to be carriers of Ascaris. Approximately 480 million people are infected with Entamoeba histolytica. At least 500 million carry Trichuris. At present, 200 to 300 million people are infected with {{one or more of the}} Schistosoma species and it is estimated that more than 20 million persons throughout the world are infected with Hymenolepsis nana". Consequences of parasitic infection can include anemia due to blood loss and iron deficiency, malnutrition, growth retardation, invasive disease, and death. Refugees are particularly at risk given the likelihood of poor or contaminated water and poor hygienic conditions in camps. Since 1999, the CDC has recommended that US-bound refugee populations from Africa and Southeast Asia undergo <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> for parasitic infections prior to departure. The US Protocol includes a single dose of albendazole. In many states, the domestic health screening exam recommends that all refugees be screened for parasitic infections whether or not they appear symptomatic. Screening often includes two stool specimens obtained more than 24 hours apart and/or a CBC with differential for evaluation of eosinophilia.|$|E

In Uganda, chloroquine {{is used for}} prophylaxis in these children despite unacceptably high levels of resistance. Intermittent <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has shown great potential for reducing prevalence of malaria and anaemia among pregnant women and infants. Objective To compare the efficacy of monthly SP <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment,</b> versus weekly chloroquine for malaria prophylaxis in children attending the Sickle Cell Clinic, Mulago Hospital. Methods Two hundred and forty two children with sickle cell anaemia were randomized to <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> with SP or weekly chloroquine for malaria prophylaxis. Active detection of malaria was made at each weekly visit to the clinic over one month. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of children with one malaria episode at one month follow-up. The secondary outcome measures included malaria-related admissions and adverse effects of the drugs. Results Ninety-three percent (114 / 122) {{of the children in}} the chloroquine group and 94 % (113 / 120) in the SP group completed one month follow up. SP reduced prevalence of malaria by 50 % compared to chloroquine [OR = 0. 50, (95 % CI 0. 26 - 0. 97) ]; p = 0. 042. Six percent (7 / 122) of the children receiving weekly chloroquine had malaria related admissions compared to 2. 5 % (3 / 120) on <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> with SP.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{diagnosis}} and treatment of malaria is often based on syndromic presentation (<b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment)</b> and microscopic examination of blood films. Treatment based on syndromic approach {{has been found to be}} costly, and contributes to the development of drug resistance, while microscopic diagnosis of malaria is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Also, there is lack of trained microscopists and reliable equipment especially in rural areas of Nigeria. However, although rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have improved the ease of appropriate diagnosis of malaria diagnosis, the cost-effectiveness of RDTs in case management of malaria has not been evaluated in Nigeria. The study hence compares the cost-effectiveness of RDT versus syndromic {{diagnosis and}} microscopy. Methods A total of 638 patients with fever, clinically diagnosed as malaria (presumptive malaria) by health workers, were selected for examination with both RDT and microscopy. Patients positive on RDT received artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and febrile patients negative on RDT received an antibiotic treatment. Using a decision tree model for a hypothetical cohort of 100, 000 patients, the diagnostic alternatives considered were <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> (base strategy), RDT and microscopy. Costs were based on a consumer and provider perspective while the outcome measure was deaths averted. Information on costs and malaria epidemiology were locally generated, and along with available data on effectiveness of diagnostic tests, adherence level to drugs for treatment, and drug efficacy levels, cost-effectiveness estimates were computed using TreeAge programme. Results were reported based on costs and effects per strategy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results The cost-effectiveness analysis at 43. 1 % prevalence level showed an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 221 per deaths averted between RDT and <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment,</b> while microscopy is dominated at that level. There was also a lesser cost of RDT ($ 0. 34 million) compared to <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> ($ 0. 37 million) and microscopy ($ 0. 39 million), with effectiveness values of 99, 862, 99, 735 and 99, 851 for RDT, <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> and microscopy, respectively. Cost-effectiveness was affected by malaria prevalence level, ACT adherence level, cost of ACT, proportion of non-malaria febrile illness cases that were bacterial, and microscopy and RDT sensitivity. Conclusion RDT is cost-effective when compared to other diagnostic strategies for malaria treatment at malaria prevalence of 43. 1 % and, therefore, a very good strategy for diagnosis of malaria in Nigeria. There is opportunity for cost savings if rapid diagnostic tests are introduced in health facilities in Nigeria for case management of malaria. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Malaria {{incidence}} {{has been}} reported to be falling in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years. This fall appears to have started before the widespread introduction of insecticide-treated nets. In the new era of calls to eliminate and eradicate malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, exploring possible causes for this fall seem pertinent. Presentation of the hypothesis The authors explore an argument that <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> of fever cases as malaria may {{have played a role in}} reducing transmission of malaria by the prophylactic effect of antimalarials and their widespread use. This strategy, which is already in practise is termed Opportunistic <b>Presumptive</b> <b>Treatment</b> (OPT). Testing the hypothesis Further comparison of epidemiological indicators between areas with OPT and more targeted treatment is required. If data suggest a benefit of OPT, combining long acting antimalarials that have an anti-gametocyticidal activity component plus using high levels of vector control measures may reduce transmission, prevent resistant strains spreading and be easily implemented. Implications of the hypothesis OPT is practised widely by <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> of fever in health facilities and home management of fever. Improving diagnosis using rapid diagnostic tests and thus reducing the number of doses of antimalarials given may have counter intuitive effects on transmission in the context of elimination of malaria in high to moderate transmission settings. </p...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hotel-based {{sex workers}} in Bangladesh have {{high rates of}} sexually {{transmissible}} infections (STIs), high client turnover and low condom use. Two monthly clinic-based strategies were compared: periodic <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> (PPT) and enhanced syndromic management (ESM) - one round of <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> followed by treatment based on assessment and laboratory tests. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial compared PPT and ESM by prevalence and incidence, behaviour, retention, cost and STI incidence and prevalence. Demographic, behavioural and clinical {{data were collected from}} women at two clinics in Dhaka. All women received <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> and were randomised to receive PPT or ESM at nine monthly visits. RESULTS: In total, 549 women (median age: < 20 years) were enrolled. At baseline, the prevalence of chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis) and gonorrhoea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) was 41 % (ESM: 41 %; PPT: 42 %). After 9 months, chlamydia and gonorrhoea decreased to 7 % overall, (ESM: 7. 4 %; PPT: 6. 8 %). At each visit, 98 % of women receiving ESM met the therapy criteria and were treated. Retention was low (50 %). Total costs were 50 % lower per visit for each woman for PPT (ESM: $ 11. 62 v. PPT: $ 5. 80). The number of sex work sessions was reduced from 3. 3 to 2. 5 (P< 0. 001), but income did not change. Coercion was reduced but condom use at last sex did not change significantly.

40|$|Background: Currently, {{more than}} 600, 000 {{immigrants}} enter the United States {{each year from}} countries where intestinal parasites are endemic. At entry persons with parasitic infections may be asymptomatic, and stool examinations are not a sensitive method of screening for parasitosis. Albendazole is a new, broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug, which was approved recently by the Food and Drug Administration. International trials have shown albendazole {{to be safe and}} effective in eradicating many parasites. In the United States there is now disagreement about whether to screen all immigrants for parasites, treat all immigrants presumptively, or do nothing unless they have symptoms. Methods: We compared {{the costs and benefits of}} no preventive intervention (watchful waiting) with those of universal screening or <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> with 400 mg of albendazole per day for five days. Those at risk were defined as immigrants to the United States from Asia, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Cost effectiveness was expressed both in terms of the cost of treatment per disability adjusted life-year (DALY) averted (one DALY is defined as the loss of one year of healthy life to disease) and in terms of the cost per hospitalization averted. Results: As compared with watchful waiting, <b>presumptive</b> <b>treatment</b> of all immigrants at risk for parasitosis would avert at least 870 DALYs, prevent at least 33 deaths and 374 hospitalizations, and save at least $ 4. 2 million per year.

Methods/Principal Findings: We randomly selected and reviewed case notes of 151 patients within 24 hours of their receiving a blood transfusion. Transfusion practices including the confirmation of diagnosis and anti-malarial treatment given were compared across three departments; Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G), Paediatrics and Medicine. Overall, 66 (44 %) of patients received malaria treatment within 24 hrs of their blood transfusion; of which only 2 (3 %) received antimalarials based on a laboratory confirmation of malaria. Paediatric patients (87 %) received the most anti-malarials and only 7 % and 24 % of recipients in medicine and O&G respectively received anti malarials. In 51 patients (78 %), the anti-malarials were prescribed {{at the same time}} as the blood transfusion and anti-malarials prescriptions exceeded the number of patient...|$|R
40|$|Stand-by {{treatment}} {{is the use}} of anti-malaria drugs carried for self-administration when fever and flu-like symptoms occur and prompt medical attention is not available. This paper aims to review the rationale for the stand-by therapy concept, the range of options available, the factors influencing the choice of therapy and the efficacy and toxicity of the various agents available in the light of ever increasing resistance to conventional drugs. The use of chloroquine as a possible stand-by {{treatment is}} limited because of widespread chloroquine resistance and the problem is further compounded by the increasing prevalence of parasites resistant to antifolate/sulpha drug combinations, particularly in South-East Asia and South America. Mefloquine is a promising agent for <b>presumptive</b> malarial <b>treatment</b> with limited foci of drug resistance, notably in Thailand. Mefloquine therapy has been associated with adverse events, mostly minor but with occasional neuropsychiatric events. The use of halofantrine, hitherto often recommended as a stand-by treatment, has been curtailed after recent research reports demonstrated that the drug may cause prolongation of the QTc interval. Current experience with stand-by therapy is limited and studies are in progress to elucidate the exact circumstances under which travellers actually use their emergency medication. Stand-by treatment is an option for clearly defined situations while prophylaxis remains the safest choice for travellers to areas of high transmission...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the incidence of}} colic and risk factors for colic in equids hospitalized for ocular disease. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. Animals- 337 equids (317 horses, 19 ponies, and 1 donkey) hospitalized for ocular disease. PROCEDURES: Medical records of equids hospitalized for > 24 hours for treatment of ocular disease between January 1997 and December 2008 were reviewed. Information from only the first hospitalization was used for equids that were hospitalized for ocular disease on more than 1 occasion. Information gathered included the signalment, the type of ocular lesion and the treatment administered, and any colic signs recorded during hospitalization {{as well as the}} severity, <b>presumptive</b> diagnosis, and <b>treatment</b> of the colic. Statistical analysis was used to identify any risk factors for colic in equids hospitalized for ocular disease. RESULTS: 72 of 337 (21. 4...|$|R
