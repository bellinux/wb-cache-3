5|$|Population sizes {{vary from}} year to year {{depending}} on local rainfall and competition from invasive plants. In 1997, P. bellidiflora {{was the subject of a}} recovery workshop conducted by the California Department of Fish and Game, where the need for permanently <b>protecting</b> <b>and</b> managing the existing populations, and reintroduction strategies for populations into suitable protected habitat were analyzed. Management and recovery actions for the species have been addressed in the United States Federal Recovery Plan for Serpentine Soil Species of the San Francisco Bay Area, finalized in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The Eye's {{importance}} {{extends to}} the afterlife as well. Egyptian funerary texts associate deceased souls with Ra in his nightly travels through the Duat, {{the realm of the}} dead, and with his rebirth at dawn. In these texts the Eye and its various manifestations often appear, <b>protecting</b> <b>and</b> giving birth to the deceased as they do for Ra. A spell in the Coffin Texts states that Bastet, as the Eye, illuminates the Duat like a torch, allowing the deceased to pass safely through its depths.|$|E

The adult robin gives alarm calls and dives in a {{threatening}} manner towards creatures it considers potential predators, such as approaching cats, dogs and humans. The fledglings are able to fly short distances after leaving the nest. The wings of juvenile birds develop rapidly, and it only takes {{a couple of weeks}} for them to become proficient at flying. The cryptically colored young birds perch in bushes or trees for protection from predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{intricacies of}} Laotian affairs, and U.S. and North Vietnamese {{interference}} in them, {{led to a}} mutual policy of each ignoring the other, {{at least in the}} public eye. However, this didn't prevent the North Vietnamese from violating Laos's neutrality by <b>protecting</b> <b>and</b> expanding their supply conduit, and by supporting their Pathet Lao allies in their war against the central government. U.S. intervention {{came in the form of}} building and supporting a CIA-backed clandestine army in its fight with the Communists and constantly bombing the trail. They also provided heavy support for the Laotian government.|$|E
5|$|The tengu's {{unpleasant}} image {{continued to}} erode in the 17th century. Some stories now presented {{them as much}} less malicious, <b>protecting</b> <b>and</b> blessing Buddhist institutions rather than menacing them or setting them on fire. According to a legend in the 18th-century , a tengu {{took the form of}} a yamabushi and faithfully served the abbot of a Zen monastery until the man guessed his attendant's true form. The tengu's wings and huge nose then reappeared. The tengu requested a piece of wisdom from his master and left, but he continued, unseen, to provide the monastery with miraculous aid.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{facet of}} the British and American frontier was a system of forts built by the military. The forts provided safe shelter for soldiers and explorers on the frontier and a base of operations for expeditions, both military and commercial. The first forts in the area had been French, particularly Fort Beauharnois, built during the 18th century and later abandoned because of the French and Indian War with the British. British Fort Charlotte at Grand Portage became essential to the fur trade <b>protecting</b> <b>and</b> supplying British traders {{as well as the}} area natives. This British fort operated in the area (illegally) until 1803, even after the area's becoming recognized as part of the United States. Other French and British fortifications, such as Fort St. Charles, had existed in the region but had been abandoned much earlier.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation; and to threaten all heretics with the appropriate penalties; whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by due process of law. He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church and accorded legal force to the canons of the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that nothing could be done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights of the Church and clergy, for <b>protecting</b> <b>and</b> extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII, Lightning reaches Anima {{along with}} Hope, Sazh Katzroy, and Oerba Dia Vanille, {{three of the}} {{surviving}} Purge exiles. When they find Serah, she turns to crystal. Lightning and the party fight Anima and are marked as l'Cie when PSICOM, Cocoon's main military force, destroys Anima. Skeptical of Snow's resolve to save her sister, Lightning abandons him and Serah, {{both of whom are}} then rescued by Oerba Yun Fang and a rogue Cocoon military force called the Cavalry. Lightning ends up traveling with Hope. During their time together, Lightning inadvertently summons Odin, and she unknowingly supports Hope's plan to assassinate Snow by <b>protecting</b> <b>and</b> training him. Throughout the game, Lightning struggles to deal with her nature as a l'Cie, her anger at being made Cocoon's enemy, and her guilt at disbelieving Serah's story. After overcoming these issues, she acknowledges Snow's relationship with Serah and his faith that they will restore her. When they kill the Sanctum fal'Cie Orphan to save Cocoon, Lightning, Serah and the party except for Vanille and Fang are allowed to return to their normal lives: Vanille and Fang form a crystal pillar to stop Cocoon from colliding with Gran Pulse.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern States. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern States would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives, regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote. Republicans began {{looking for a way to}} offset this advantage, either by <b>protecting</b> <b>and</b> attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.|$|E
5|$|Liu Kang {{appears in}} the 2013's second season of the web series , portrayed by Brian Tee. Liu Kang in Legacy is portrayed as an anti-hero and {{fighting}} {{on the side of}} Outworld rather than that of Earthrealm in the web series. In this version, he is shown to have left a monastery to live a normal life working at a diner with a fiancée. After watching a pair of thieves kill her in a robbery attempt, he becomes consumed with anger and revenge, and further distances himself from Kung Lao and the ideals that were taught to him. After working as a freelance assassin for a few years, he is approached by Shang Tsung, who convinces him that humanity is not worth <b>protecting</b> <b>and</b> asks him to join the realm of Outworld in the upcoming Mortal Kombat tournament, which he agrees to. During the tournament, he easily subdues Johnny Cage and Kurtis Stryker before being confronted by Kung Lao, who is surprised at his old friend's change of allegiance.|$|E
5|$|Mass Effect is a single-player action {{role-playing}} game {{in which}} the player takes the role of Commander Shepard through a third-person perspective. Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat-training and first name {{are determined by the}} player before the game begins. There are six different character classes for the player to choose from and each of them has different talents that provide enhanced combat capabilities. For example, the Soldier class is trained in weapon damage and has improved health, while the Sentinel class is trained in <b>protecting</b> <b>and</b> healing allies. At one point in the game, players may evolve their base class talent into one of two specializations, which depend on the class chosen by the player. Although any class can use any weapon type, each class is only effective with the weapons they are trained in.|$|E

Peattie finds the Wieder family, whom Scully is <b>protecting,</b> <b>and</b> makes a poppet with Scully's hair and photo inside. He places nails in the doll's eyes and Scully promptly goes blind. Peattie breaks into the house, takes Scully's gun and stabs a poppet of Wieder, causing the doctor to collapse in pain.

Mulder shows up, finds Scully's doll and removes the nails from it, allowing her to regain her vision and shoot Peattie. He is placed in a coma and Lynnette's body is shipped back to her home in West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|When Coutances {{returned}} to his diocese in July 1196, {{he found that the}} king had seized the manor of Andely independently of the treaty provisions, and when the archbishop refused to relinquish it to the king, Richard began to fortify the manor. He also built a castle there, now Château Gaillard. On 7 November 1196, Coutances set off for Rome, to protest the seizure to the pope. Richard sent a royal embassy, and eventually a settlement was reached. The archbishop was ordered to remove the interdict he had placed on the duchy, and in return for the manor received two others and the seaport of Dieppe. The various lands that Coutances' received in exchange for Andely were worth £1,405 a year. This episode marked the end of Coutances' service to the Angevin kings; {{for the rest of his}} life the archbishop focused on <b>protecting</b> <b>and</b> guarding the archiepiscopal properties and rights.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the overall}} command of Australian Major General Peter Cosgrove, INTERFET began {{arriving}} on 12 September 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security, <b>protecting</b> <b>and</b> supporting UNAMET, and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations. With {{the withdrawal of}} the Indonesian armed forces, police and government officials from East Timor, UNAMET re-established its headquarters in Dili on 28 September. On 19 October 1999, Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a UN peacekeeping force, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) was established, becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence. The hand-over of command of military operations from INTERFET to UNTAET was completed on 28 February 2000. Australia continued to support the UN peacekeeping operation with between 1,500 and 2,000 personnel, as well as landing craft and Blackhawk helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission. During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro-Indonesian militia and {{on a number of occasions}} Indonesian forces as well, especially along the border with West Timor. Significant actions occurred in Suai, Mota'ain and at Aidabasalala in October 1999. However, with the security situation stabilised the bulk of the Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005. Two Australians died from non-battle related causes, while a number were wounded in action.|$|E
