A finishing machine known as a multi disc sander or buffer is then used for the final sanding steps.|$|E

Six different belt constructions were life-tested, producing three failure modes: tooth root cracking, cord delamination and fabric separation.

The results of this examination were then used to draw conclusions about which material properties most influence the belt life. I t is concluded that the tooth deflections at entry to and exit from the pulleys are most damaging, and that any material change which will increase the dynamic tooth stiffness will increase the belt life within the three failure modes encountered. ...|$|R

Also, elastic and in-elastic analyses are both considered and a comparison is made between current results and the results obtained from the system with a fixed base. The best location of the outrigger and belt truss system is determined by considering the maximum roof displacement, base shear and base moment in both models with and without SSI.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{absolute}} nodal coordinate formulation {{can be used}} in multibody system applications {{where the}} rotation and deformation within the finite element are large and where {{there is a need to}} account for geometrical non-linearities. In this formulation, the gradi-ents of the global positions are used as nodal coordinates and no rotations are interpolated over the finite element. For thin plate and shell elements, the plane stress conditions can be applied and only gradients obtained by differentiation with respect to the element mid-surface spatial parameters need to be defined. This automatically reduces the number of element degrees of freedoms, eliminates the high frequencies due to the oscillations of some gradient components along the element thickness, and as a result makes the plate element computationally more efficient. In this paper, the performance of a thin plate element based on the absolute nodal coordinate formulation is investigated. The lower dimension plate element used in this investi-gation allows for an arbitrary rigid body displacement and large deformation within the element. The element leads to a constant mass matrix and zero Coriolis and centrifugal forces. The performance of the element is compared with other plate elements previously developed using the absolute nodal coordinate formulation. It is shown that the finite element used in this investigation is much more efficient when compared with previously proposed elements in the case of thin structures. Numerical examples are presented in order to demon-strate the use of the formulation developed in this paper and the computational advantages gained from using the thin plate element. The thin plate element examined in this study can be efficiently used in many applications including modelling of <b>paper</b> materials, <b>belt</b> drives, rotor dynamics, and tyres...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Surface {{roughness}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parameters in grinding, which directly affects the quality of the processed surface and has quite a lot of effect on the shape and position accuracy, installation accuracy of the workpiece. In the grinding process, the surface roughness is formatted from the abrasive which effects on the surface of spherical head, and is the result of mutual interference between abrasive and spherical head. Many factors affect the surface roughness, such as the shape and size of contact roller, abrasive morphology, grinding method, the stiffness of machine tool and workpiece, abrasive wear and vibration in the machining process. All of these have an impact grinding surface roughness.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the GEMAS project, 2211 samples of agricultural soil (Ap, 0 – 20 cm, regularly ploughed fields), and 2118 samples fromland under permanent grass cover (Gr, 0 – 10 cm, grazing land soil) were collected across almost the whole European continent, at a density of 1 sample site/ 2500 km 2, in accordance with a common sampling protocol. Among many other elements, the concentrations of Co, Cr, Cu and Ni in European soil were determined by ICP-MS after a hot aqua extraction, and WD-XRFS analytical methods, and their spatial distribution patterns generated by means of a GIS software. The presence of mafic and ultramafic rocks, ophiolite complexes and mineralisation, is widespread across the European continent, and seems to explain most of the variability of the elements studied in this <b>paper.</b> A large <b>belt,</b> north of the last glaciation maximum limit, is generally dominated by lower concentrations compared with central European and Mediterranean areas and to some areas in Northern Europe where higher Co, Cr, Cu and Ni values also occur. The application of the guideline value set for Cu and Ni by the EU Directive 86 / 278 /EEC to the Ap soil samples of the GEMAS data set highlighted that at the continental scale the use of a unique reference interval is a tool of limited effectiveness; the lithological variation, occurring across a whole continent, generates changes in the geochemistry of soil, which cannot be accommodated by using a single reference interval even if it is very wide. The GEMAS data set should form the sound basis to set at the European scale the geochemical background reference intervals, at least, for regions sharing common lithological settings and a common geological history...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five papers, {{each of which}} complements the regional understanding of the Ceduna Delta System, offshore South Australia. Deltas commonly form linked systems of extension, on the delta top, and compression, in the delta toe. This link is promoted {{by the presence of}} a detachment layer of more ductile sediments {{at the base of the}} delta, which mechanically decouples deltaic sediments from those beneath it. These systems are often explained using Critical Taper Wedge mechanics, which is commonly applied to understand the rock strength properties and the role of pore fluid pressure at the base of the wedge (within the detachment layer) and within the wedge, in these linked systems of extension and compression. To better understand the effect of basal pore fluid pressure on delta—deepwater fold thrust belt systems, I present an in-depth application of Critical Taper Wedge mechanics to the data-rich deepwater Niger Delta Toe in West Africa, a modern day analogue for the ancient Ceduna Sub-basin (Paper 1). This application involved developing a new technique to measure key variables from seismic reflection data in the Niger Delta Toe and input them into a script to calculate the basal pore fluid pressure required to form the observed present-day geometries. With this new approach and increased understanding of the role of basal pore fluid pressure on delta wedge geometry it was possible to better understand how detachment variables control distribution of the lobes that comprise the Cretaceous-age Ceduna Delta. Regional structural mapping of the Ceduna Delta resulted in separation of the delta lobes based on tectonic style and also examining the linkages between the systems, explaining the unique stacking of the delta tops while each system maintained independent deepwater fold-thrust <b>belts</b> (<b>Paper</b> 2). Furthermore, detailed 3 D seismic reflection data is interpreted to investigate inversion structures and potential for fault reactivation in the basin (Paper 3). The boundary element method geomechanical code Poly 3 D© was used to investigate delta-top fault reactivation potential from a 3 D seismic derived fault network along with the present day stress determined from petroleum wells. Results demonstrate a moderate to high probability for contemporary reactivation of faults under a strike-slip to strike-slip-normal fault stress regime (Paper 3). In addition, detrital zircon analysis, apatite fission track analysis and zircon fission track analysis were undertaken to investigate the potential source(s) for the deltaic sediment input in the Ceduna Delta system (Paper 4). Over 1500 detrital zircon and apatite grains were analysed from petroleum wells and outcrop samples located onshore and offshore South Australia. The results indicate approximately 1 - 2 km of Late Cretaceous uplift/exhumation of the proximal arcuate shaped South Australian southern margin provided the source for the Santonian-Maastrichtian delta lobe, mainly from erosion of existing Permian-Cenomanian sedimentary cover. Finally, the last paper presented in this thesis (Paper 5) ties in new 2 D reflection seismic data that was not available when Paper 2 was written, to further examine the geometry of the deepwater fold-thrust belts and the hydrocarbon potential of the Ceduna Sub-basin.
