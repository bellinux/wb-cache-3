5|$|In 1934, {{his wife}} Badia'a died and al-Hajj Muhammad {{was left with}} his four sons. With the killing of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, a Muslim revivalist preacher and anti-colonial militant by British forces, {{tensions}} between the Palestinian Arab population, among whom al-Qassam was popular, and the authorities rose significantly. His sympathizers grew in number {{and the notion of}} armed struggle against British rule and British sponsorship of Zionism became increasingly popular {{as an alternative to the}} diplomatic negotiations between the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> and the British government. The negotiations were ultimately seen by the local population as a futile effort that bore no tangible results. When al-Hajj Muhammad actively took part in the upcoming revolt, he entrusted his children with his sister Halima, a widow. According to his eldest son Kamal, she too was a grain merchant, who later traded in textiles. She also financially supported the children's education. Al-Hajj Muhammad would normally meet with his sons for one or two days in different villages. His children would be escorted to his location by one of al-Hajj Muhammad's rebels.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, American {{intellectual}} Noam Chomsky argued that Israeli {{claims that the}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> rejected the international consensus calling for a Palestinian state, with borders along the Green Line, were {{not consistent with the}} documented record. In 2008 Al Jazeera and Haaretz both reported that elements in the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership,</b> even inside Hamas, have called for a two-state settlement based on the pre-June 1967 borders (the Green Line). Although Hamas' official policy is committed to Israel's destruction, Ismail Haniya, the prime minister of the Palestinian unity government until June 2007, suggested that a long-term truce with Israel could be achieved if Israel withdrew from territory occupied in 1967.|$|E
25|$|The WOJAC functioned for {{approximately}} 25 years (from 1975 until 1999). WOJAC's aspiration was {{to operate in}} the national arena, to counterbalance the claims of the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> on the right to the land and on the refugee question.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Gaza, where Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in a violent civil war with rival Fatah, Israel placed restrictions on its border with Gaza borders and ended economic cooperation with the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> based there. Israel and Egypt have imposed a blockade of the Gaza Strip since 2007. Israel maintains the blockade is necessary to limit Palestinian rocket attacks from Gaza and to prevent Hamas from smuggling advanced rockets and weapons capable of hitting its cities.|$|E
25|$|With {{the aim of}} marginalising the settlers' {{more militant}} wing, Barak courted {{moderate}} settler opinion, securing agreement for the dismantlement of 12 new outposts that had been constructed since the Wye River Agreement of November 1998, but the continued expansion of existing settlements with plans for 3,000 new houses in the West Bank drew strong condemnation from the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership.</b> Though construction within existing settlements was permitted under the Oslo agreements, Palestinian supporters contend that any continued construction was contrary to its spirit, prejudiced the outcome of final status negotiations, and undermined Palestinian confidence in Barak's desire for peace.|$|E
25|$|Al-Haj Ibrahim {{moved to}} Amman, Jordan after fleeing Haifa upon its capture by Jewish forces. He wrote memoirs of his {{experience}} in Palestine from 1947 to the early 1950s. They mostly outlined {{the responsibility of the}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> regarding the circumstances of the city's fall, and exposing its performance and political discourse during the British Mandate period. Al-Haj Ibrahim died in Amman in 1953, and was buried in Damascus, Syria. Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi edited and published his memoirs, titled Defending Haifa and the Problem of Palestine: The Memoirs of Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim, 1891-1953, in the Institute for Palestine Studies, Beirut, in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, {{negotiations}} {{took place}} between Israel and the PLO {{as well as other}} <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaderships,</b> all while there was still a strong concern among large parts of the Israeli public and the Israeli leadership that the negotiations were not sincere, and that the Palestinians' willingness to compromise is just a smoke-screen for implementing the Ten Point Program.|$|R

25|$|Activists {{say there}} is a growing {{crackdown}} on writers who criticize the Palestinian Government. According to Executive Director of Advancing Human Rights David Keyes, in 2013, Anas Awwad, a 26-year-old Palestinian activist, was sentenced in absentia by a Palestinian court in Nablus, the West Bank, to one year in prison for “extending his tongue” against the Palestinian Authority’s president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Facebook. Keyes also states that in 2012, Palestinian blogger Jamal Abu Rihan was arrested by the Palestinian Authority for starting a Facebook campaign called “The People Want an End to Corruption,” he was indicted under the charges of“extending his tongue” against the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Peled—member of the Left Camp of Israel Executive {{for the whole}} of the party's six years of existence, though he never held a public office on its behalf—claimed that the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership,</b> {{representing}} its entire people, could not be expected to make in a dialogue with radical Israeli dissidents the kind of concessions that would undermine its negotiating position if and when it came to negotiate with the Government of Israel. (Which, with Menachem Begin as Israel's PM at the time, and Ariel Sharon as Defence Minister, seemed a very distant possibility). In effect, the ICIPP—with Peled and Avnery at its head—became a faction within the Left Camp of Israel, embroiled in constant internecine struggle with the opposing faction.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{violence}} of the second intifada and the political success of Hamas (a group dedicated to Israel's destruction) have convinced many Israelis that peace and negotiation are not possible and a two state system is not the answer. Hardliners believe that Israel should annex all Palestinian territory, or at least all minus the Gaza Strip. Israelis view the peace process as hindered and near impossible due to terrorism on the part of Palestinians and do not trust <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> to maintain control. In fact, Pedahzur goes as {{far as to say that}} suicide terrorism succeeded where peace negotiations failed in encouraging withdrawal by Israelis from cities in the West Bank. A common theme throughout the peace process has been a feeling that the Palestinians give too little in their peace offers.|$|E
50|$|Fighting among rival Palestinian and Arab {{movements}} {{has played}} a crucial role in shaping Israel's security policy towards Palestinian militants, as well as in the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership's</b> own policies. As early as the 1930s revolts in Palestine, Arab forces fought each other while also skirmishing with Zionist and British forces, and internal conflicts continue to the present day. During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian baathists broke from the Palestine Liberation Organization and allied with the Shia Amal Movement, fighting a bloody civil war that killed thousands of Palestinians.|$|R
5000|$|David Bedein, {{the bureau}} chief of the Israel Resource News Agency, {{expressed}} disappointment that [...] "Dershowitz has now adopted a strategy of 'if you can’t beat them, join them.'" [...] Bedein criticizes several of Dershowitz's positions individually, giving each [...] "error" [...] its own section arguing that they are oblivious to reality. He feels the author's [...] "failure to challenge questionable assumptions about the prospects for peace is deeply regrettable. By exaggerating the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership’s</b> readiness to make peace, Dershowitz has granted credibility to those critics, many of them rank anti-Semites, who are desperate to blame the persistence of the conflict on Israel." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{partition}} {{plan was}} rejected {{out of hand}} by <b>Palestinian</b> Arab <b>leadership</b> and {{by most of the}} Arab population. Meeting in Cairo on November and December 1947, the Arab League then adopted a series of resolutions endorsing a military solution to the conflict.|$|R
25|$|On November 11, 2004 Arafat {{died at the}} Percy {{training}} {{hospital of}} the Armies near Paris. He {{was buried in the}} courtyard of the Mukataa on November 12, 2004. The site still serves as the Ramallah headquarters of the Palestinian Authority, as well the official West Bank office of Mahmoud Abbas. Throughout 2005, while the Disengagement Plan was underway, some US government officials suggested to the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> to move the provisional capital back to Gaza, where it had been when the Palestinian Aurhority was first established in 1994. President Abbas, however, refrained from doing so, arguing that at this point, it was important to keep the administrative center in the West Bank in order to remind the international community that the West Bank was still awaiting territorial solution.|$|E
25|$|Consulted by {{a senior}} {{figure of the}} PLO during the siege of Beirut, he set forth five {{political}} principles that would prove conducive to securing the PLO's political battle on a firmer footing. (1) Abandon Beirut (2) {{put an end to}} terrorism (3) relocate in Tunis, the only area where the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> could enjoy real political liberty (4) set up a provisory government, which would immediately be recognized by at least 150 countries (5) recognize Israel. If these measures were taken, Goldmann advised, the PLO would establish the basis {{for the creation of a}} Palestinian state, alongside that of Israel. Goldmann's vision was to make Israel the spiritual and moral center for all Jews, a neutral state, and somewhat on the model of Switzerland, with international guarantees of its security, existence and borders, and perhaps even a permanent symbolic international presence.|$|E
25|$|During the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, ties {{were made}} between the Arab {{leadership}} in Palestine and the Nazi movement in Germany. These connections led to cooperation between the Palestinian national movement and the Axis powers later on during World War II. In May 1941 Amin al-Husayni issued a fatwa for a holy war against Britain. In 1941 during a meeting with Adolf Hitler Amin al-Husayni asked Germany to oppose, {{as part of the}} Arab struggle for independence, the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine. He received a promise from Hitler that Germany would eliminate the existing Jewish foundations in Palestine after the Germans had gained victory in the war. During the war Amin al-Husayni joined the Nazis, serving with the Waffen SS in Bosnia and Yugoslavia. In addition, during the war a joint Palestinian-Nazi military operation was held in the region of Palestine. These factors caused a deterioration in the relations between the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> and the British, which turned to collaborate with the Yeshuv during the period known as the 200 days of dread.|$|E
2500|$|Israeli President Shimon Peres {{said the}} attack {{appeared}} to be aimed at disrupting the possible resumption of direct peace talks between the Israeli and <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaderships</b> {{for the first time}} in over 18 months. [...] "There is a real struggle in the Middle East between the peace camp of moderate countries and the camp of extremists, who want to sabotage any chance of peace," [...] Peres said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made similar comments, telling Jordan's King Abdullah and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that the attack telling [...] "was committed by terror agents who want to thwart the peace process". [...] "All states in the region that aspire towards peace should fight these powers, push terror away and bring peace closer," [...] he added.|$|R
40|$|The Israeli-Palestinian {{conflict}} is currently {{embroiled in a}} deep-seeded political impasse. The source of this diplomatic deadlock is the separate theoretical trajectories characterising each side s approach to the conflict. Israel is more content with managing the conflict whilst the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaderships</b> desperately seek an outright resolution. Alternatively, {{at the grassroots level}} Palestinians are far more concerned with effectuating change in their own personal circumstances. This encompasses issues which do not directly relate to the resolution the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaderships</b> seek. A distinct switch in discourse from nationalism to human and civil rights is occurring on the ground. Such a switch exemplifies this political disillusionment and is indicative of the alternative theory conflict transformation theory. Parlevliet argues conflict transformation should be analysed in conjunction with human rights. In this regard, the current climate in Israel-Palestine offers a unique case study in which to apply and answer Parlevliet s call. In doing so, this study takes Lederach s contribution to the theory of conflict transformation and analyses it alongside Parlevliet s argument in relation to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and the growing call for human rights. It demonstrates the multi-layered and holistic nature of the human rights argument by showing how the switch in discourse attempts to address issues along the micro-macro spectrum. In accordance with conflict transformation, the thesis draws upon a number of theories and methodologies to explicate how the switch to a human rights discourse circumnavigates a host of ideological and political barriers, which impede a possible resolution to the much protracted conflict. It concludes by exposing the cyclical nature of the micro-macro polemics, and how they ultimately reinforce each other in strangling any diplomatic possibility for opening up more alternative discourses to the current political approaches to the conflict...|$|R
50|$|After the Oslo Accords, the Mukataas {{were used}} as {{governmental}} offices and headquarters for the Palestinian National Authority. The Mukaatas in Ramallah and Gaza, the two major Palestinian cities, were also used as headquarters to the high <b>Palestinian</b> Authority <b>leadership,</b> including as office for Yasser Arafat, long-time Palestinian Authority president.|$|R
25|$|There {{had already}} been rioting and attacks on and massacres of Jews in 1921 and 1929. During the 1930s Palestinian Arab popular discontent with Jewish {{immigration}} and increasing Arab landlessness grew. In the late 1920s and early 1930s several factions of Palestinian society, especially from the younger generation, became impatient with the internecine divisions and ineffectiveness of the Palestinian elite and engaged in grass-roots anti-British and anti-Zionist activism organized by {{groups such as the}} Young Men's Muslim Association. There was also support for the growth in influence of the radical nationalist Independence Party (Hizb al-Istiqlal), which called for a boycott of the British in the manner of the Indian Congress Party. Some even took to the hills to fight the British and the Zionists. Most of these initiatives were contained and defeated by notables in the pay of the Mandatory Administration, particularly the mufti and his cousin Jamal al-Husayni. The younger generation also formed the backbone of the organisation of the six-month general strike of 1936, which marked the start of the great Palestinian Revolt. According to Khalidi this was a grass-roots uprising, which was eventually adopted by the old <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership,</b> whose 'inept leadership helped to doom these movements as well'.|$|E
25|$|Palestinians {{have held}} diverse views and {{perceptions}} of the peace process. A key starting point for understanding these views is {{an awareness of the}} differing objectives sought by advocates of the Palestinian cause. 'New Historian' Israeli academic Ilan Pappe says the cause of the conflict from a Palestinian point of view dates back to 1948 with the creation of Israel (rather than Israel’s views of 1967 being the crucial point and the return of occupied territories being central to peace negotiations), and that the conflict has been a fight to bring home refugees to a Palestinian state. Therefore, this for some was the ultimate aim of the peace process, and for groups such as Hamas still is. However Slater says that this ‘maximalist’ view of a destruction of Israel in order to regain Palestinian lands, a view held by Arafat and the PLO initially, has steadily moderated from the late 1960s onwards to a preparedness to negotiate and instead seek a two-state solution. The Oslo Accords demonstrated the recognition of this acceptance by the then <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> of the state of Israel’s right to exist in return for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and West Bank. However, there are recurrent themes prevalent throughout peace process negotiations including a feeling that Israel offers too little and a mistrust of its actions and motives. Yet, the demand for the right of return by the Palestinian refugees to Israel has remained a cornerstone of the Palestinian view and has been repeatedly enunciated by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas who is leading the Palestinian peace effort.|$|E

500|$|In a {{reference}} to the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership,</b> Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization Yasser Arafat is mentioned by name.

In a later episode, however ("Gaza" [...] in season five), the name of the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority was changed to Nizar Farad, a fictional character. By that point in mid-2004, Arafat was in failing health in real life, and would die in November 2004. The show continued to use the Farad character and never made any references to Arafat's successor Mahmoud Abbas.|$|E
500|$|While {{fighting}} was on hold, the British government {{announced it would}} not restrict Jewish immigration to Palestine and instead proposed a partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states as put forward by the Peel Commission (November 1936–January 1937.) These moves antagonized the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership</b> whose principal concern was increased Jewish settlement. Thus, they boycotted the commission from the time it began its work. The AHC under the chairmanship of Amin al-Husayni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, requested rebel leaders return and resume military activities in Palestine to pressure the authorities. To that end, al-Hajj Muhammad returned to Palestine in April to command his fasa'il in the Tulkarm-Jenin-Nablus region, which was referred to by the authorities as the [...] "Triangle of Terror" [...] due to the concentration of rebel activity in the area.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{tensions}} between Palestinians and the Jordanian government increased greatly; heavily armed Palestinian elements {{had created a}} virtual [...] "state within a state" [...] in Jordan, eventually controlling several strategic positions in that country. After their proclaimed victory in the Battle of Karameh, Fatah and other Palestinian militias began taking control of civil life in Jordan. They set up roadblocks, publicly humiliated Jordanian police forces, molested women and levied illegal taxes—all of which Arafat either condoned or ignored. King Hussein considered this a growing threat to his kingdom's sovereignty and security, and attempted to disarm the militias. However, {{in order to avoid}} a military confrontation with opposition forces, Hussein dismissed several of his anti-PLO cabinet officials, including some of his own family members, and invited Arafat to become Prime Minister of Jordan. Arafat refused, citing his belief in the need for a Palestinian state with <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leadership.</b>|$|E
