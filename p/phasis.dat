5|$|In 550, a pro-Persian revolt {{broke out}} among the Abasgians, a people that neighboured Lazica to the north. This {{provided}} {{an opportunity for a}} high-ranking Lazic noble, called Terdetes, who had quarrelled with Gubazes, to betray to the Persians Tzibile, an important fort {{in the land of the}} Apsili, a tribe under Lazic suzerainty. The Apsili retook the fort, but refused to accept Lazic rule until persuaded to do so by the Byzantine general John Guzes. In 551, the Byzantines finally took and razed Petra, but a new army under Mihr-Mihroe was able to establish Persian control over the eastern part of Lazica. The Byzantine forces in Lazica withdrew west to the mouth of the <b>Phasis,</b> while the Lazi, including Gubazes and his family, sought refuge in the mountains. Despite enduring harsh conditions in the winter of 551/552, Gubazes rejected the peace offers conveyed by envoys from Mihr-Mihroe. In 552, the Persians received substantial reinforcements, but their attacks on the fortresses held by the Byzantines and the Lazi were repulsed.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines then {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the Persian fort of Onoguris, but they were forced to abandon it at the unexpectedly quick arrival of Persian relief forces under Nachoragan. In spring 556, Justin was {{with the rest of the}} Byzantine forces at Nesos, when Nakhoragan invaded western Lazica, making for the town of <b>Phasis.</b> The Byzantines hastily departed for the town, managing to reach it before the Persian army and then proceeded to successfully defend it during a prolonged siege. Following this success, in early 556 Justin returned to Nesos to guard it together with Buzes, while the rest of the army marched against the Misimians, a tribe that had recently allied itself with the Persians and killed the Byzantine general Soterichus. Justin's only activity during this time was to dispatch one of his officers, Elminzur, to capture Rhodopolis (modern Vartsikhe) with 2,000 cavalry. In the next year, a general truce was agreed, which was finalized into a peace treaty in 562.|$|E

25|$|The first {{recorded}} usage of Eurṓpē as a geographic term {{is in the}} Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, {{in reference to the}} western shore of the Aegean Sea. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by Anaximander and Hecataeus. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the <b>Phasis</b> River (the modern Rioni River) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BC. Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the Nile and the <b>Phasis</b> forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the River Don, rather than the <b>Phasis,</b> as the boundary between Europe and Asia. Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer Strabo at the River Don. The Book of Jubilees described the continents as the lands given by Noah to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar, separating it from North Africa, to the Don, separating it from Asia.|$|E
25|$|In early 556, Bouzes {{was ordered}} to defend Nesus (a minor island) at the River <b>Phasis.</b> He was later joined there by Justin. The two {{continued}} guarding the island, {{while the rest of}} the army was campaigning against the Misimiani (a local tribe). He is not mentioned again.|$|E
25|$|The path the Ottoman army took is not known. Kritoboulos {{states that}} Mehmed crossed the Taurus Mountains, {{becoming}} one of only four generals to have crossed them. (The others being Alexander the Great, Pompey, and Tamburlane.) However, as his translator Charles Riggs points out, to Kritoboulos all of the mountain systems of Asia Minor {{were part of the}} Taurus. Doukas states that Mehmed led his soldiers across Armenia and the <b>Phasis</b> River, then ascended the Caucasus Mountains before reaching Trebizond. This makes no sense when one examines a map, for both the <b>Phasis</b> River and the Caucasus are far to the east of their destination. However, Mihailović wrote in his memoirs that the army marched into Georgia, so it is possible that Mehmed did make a show of force to intimidate the kings of Georgia from aiding their ally. Or this is further proof that the soldiers in the Sultan's army had as little idea where they were going as the hairs in the Sultan's beard.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greeks knew of Colchis, and it {{featured}} in the Greek legend of Jason and the Argonauts, who travelled there {{in search of the}} Golden Fleece. Starting around 2000BC, northwestern Colchis was inhabited by the Svan and Zan peoples of the Kartvelian tribes. Another important ethnic element of ancient Colchis were Greeks who between 1000 and 550BC established many trading colonies in the coastal area, among them Naessus, Pitiys, Dioscurias (modern Sukhumi), Guenos, <b>Phasis</b> (modern Poti), Apsaros, and Rhizos (modern Rize in Turkey). In the eastern part of Georgia there was a struggle for the leadership among the various Georgian confederations during the 6th–4th centuries BC, which was finally won by the Kartlian tribes from the region of Mtskheta. According to the Georgian tradition, the Kingdom of Kartli (known as Iberia in the Greek-Roman literature) was founded around 300BC by Parnavaz I, the first ruler of the Parnavazid dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Greek thinkers {{subsequently}} {{debated whether}} Africa (then called Libya) {{should be considered}} part of Asia or a third part of the world. Division into three parts eventually came to predominate. From the Greek viewpoint, the Aegean Sea {{was the center of}} the world; Asia lay to the east, Europe to the north and west, and Africa to the south. The boundaries between the continents were not fixed. Early on, the Europe–Asia boundary was taken to run from the Black Sea along the Rioni River (known then as the <b>Phasis)</b> in Georgia. Later it was viewed as running from the Black Sea through Kerch Strait, the Sea of Azov and along the Don River (known then as the Tanais) in Russia. The boundary between Asia and Africa was generally taken to be the Nile River. Herodotus in the 5th century BC, however, objected to the unity of Egypt being split into Asia and Africa ("Libya") and took the boundary to lie along the western border of Egypt, regarding Egypt as part of Asia. He also questioned the division into three of what is really a single landmass, a debate that continues nearly two and a half millennia later.|$|E
25|$|In {{the western}} half of Georgia, ancient Colchis, which had {{remained}} under stronger Roman influence, local churches were under {{jurisdiction of the}} Patriarchate of Constantinople, and were culturally and linguistically Hellenistic. Bishops from the port cities took part in ecumenical councils, from the Council of Nicea (325) together with those from the Byzantine territories. From the 6th century, those churches, whose language remained Greek, were headed by a metropolitan in <b>Phasis.</b> The integration of the Black sea coastal regions into {{what came to be}} known as Georgia was a long process. A first step came with the Arab invasions of the 7th and 8th centuries, which mostly affected Kartli. Refugees, among them noblemen such as Archil of Kakheti, took shelter in the West, either in Abkhazia or Tao-Klarjeti, and brought there their culture. Such movements led to the progressive merge of western and eastern churches under the latter, as Byzantine power decreased and doctrinal differences disappeared. The western Church broke away from Constantinople and recognized the authority of the Catholicos of Mtskheta by the end of the 9th century. Political unification under the Bagrationi dynasty consolidated this evolution by the end of the 10th century: in a single, unified Kingdom of Georgia, there would be a unified Georgian Church.|$|E
25|$|Mithradates VI quelled an {{uprising}} {{in the region}} in 83BC and gave Colchis to his son Mithridates, who, soon being suspected in having plotted against his father, was executed. During the Third Mithridatic War, Mithridates VI made another of his sons, Machares, king of Bosporus and Colchis, who held his power, but for a short period. On the defeat of Mithridates VI of Pontus in 65BC, Colchis was occupied by Pompey, who captured {{one of the local}} chiefs (sceptuchus) Olthaces, and installed Aristarchus as a dynast (65–47 BC). On the fall of Pompey, Pharnaces II, son of Mithridates, took advantage of Julius Caesar being occupied in Egypt, and reduced Colchis, Armenia, and some part of Cappadocia, defeating Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus, whom Caesar subsequently sent against him. His triumph was, however, short-lived. Under Polemon I, the son and heir of Zenon, Colchis was part of the Pontus and the Bosporan Kingdom. After the death of Polemon (8BC), his second wife Pythodorida of Pontus retained possession of Colchis as well as of Pontus, although the kingdom of Bosporus was wrested from her power. Her son and successor, Polemon II of Pontus, was induced by Emperor Nero to abdicate the throne, and both Pontus and Colchis were incorporated in the Province of Galatia (63) and later, in Cappadocia (81). <b>Phasis,</b> Dioscurias and other Greek settlements of the coast did not fully recover after the wars of 60-40 BC and Trebizond became the economical and political centre of the region.|$|E
500|$|If {{the capture}} of Petra {{redeemed}} Bessas {{in the eyes of}} his contemporaries, his subsequent actions tarnished it again: instead of following up his success and capture the mountain passes connecting Lazica with the Persian province of Iberia, he retired west to the Roman provinces of Pontica and busied himself with its administration. This inactivity allowed the Persians under Mihr-Mihroe to consolidate Persian control over the eastern part of Lazica. The Byzantine forces in Lazica withdrew west to the mouth of the <b>Phasis,</b> while the Lazi, including their king Gubazes and his family, sought refuge in the mountains. Despite enduring harsh conditions in the winter of 551–552, Gubazes rejected the peace offers conveyed by envoys from Mihr-Mihroe. In 552, the Persians received substantial reinforcements, but their attacks on the fortresses held by the Byzantines and the Lazi were repulsed.|$|E
500|$|In 554, now {{experienced}} in military affairs, Justin was sent east to Lazica {{to join the}} Byzantine forces under Bessas, Buzes, and Martin. His first encounter with the Persians was unsuccessful. Along with Bessas, Justin and his troops were encamped at the plain of Chytropolia, near the strategically important fortress of Telephis, which was held by Martin. The Persian general Mihr-Mihroe, however, succeeded in dislodging Martin from Telephis. Martin withdrew to join the other two generals at Chytropolia, but there again the Byzantine army, too slow to take up position, was forced to flee in disarray before the advancing Persians, retreating along the <b>Phasis</b> river to the fortified island of Nesos (Νήσος, Greek for [...] "island"). Bessas was dismissed from high command as magister militum per Armeniam after this debacle, and succeeded by Martin with Justin as his second in command. Justin was ignorant of Martin's intention to assassinate their ally, the Lazic king Gubazes II; when he learned of the deed, he was shocked, but did not reprimand Martin because he believed – wrongly – that the murder had been carried out at the orders of Emperor Justinian.|$|E

2500|$|The {{advanced}} economy and favorable geographic and natural {{conditions of the}} area attracted the Milesian Greeks, who colonized the Colchian coast establishing their trading posts at <b>Phasis,</b> Gyenos, and Sukhumi in the sixth-fifth centuries BC. It was considered [...] "the farthest voyage" [...] according to an ancient Greek proverbial expression, the easternmost location in that society's known world, where the sun rose. It was situated just outside the lands conquered by Alexander the Great. <b>Phasis</b> and Dioscurias were the splendid Greek cities dominated by the mercantile oligarchies, sometimes being troubled by the Colchians from the hinterland before seemingly, assimilating totally. After {{the fall of the}} Persian Empire, a significant part of Colchis, locally known as Egrisi, was annexed to the recently created Kingdom of Iberia (Kartli) in c.302BC, however, soon Colchis seceded and broke up into several small princedoms ruled by sceptuchi. They retained a degree of independence until conquered (circa 101 BC) by Mithridates VI of Pontus.|$|E
2500|$|He {{is first}} {{recorded}} leading a tagma of Moors in the Siege of <b>Phasis.</b> His troops {{are described as}} peltasts and spearmen (...) , probably meaning they were only armed with shield and lances. His troops were stationed at the [...] "middle part" [...] of the fortifications, alongside Theodore and Philomathius. Theodore led heavy infantry consisting of Tzani, Philomathius led Isaurian slingers and dart-throwers [...] The Tzani were a tribe of the Caucasus. Procopius reports that [...] "From ancient times the Tzani have lived as an independent people".|$|E
2500|$|The name of Colchis first {{appears in}} Aeschylus and Pindar. The earlier writers only speak about {{it under the}} name of Aea (Aia), the {{residence}} of the mythical king Aeëtes: [...] "Kolchian Aia lies at the furthest limits of sea and earth," [...] wrote Apollonius of Rhodes. The main river was the <b>Phasis</b> (now Rioni), which was according to some writers the south boundary of Colchis, but more probably flowed through the middle of that country from the Caucasus west by south to the Euxine, and the Anticites or Atticitus (now Kuban). Arrian mentions many others by name, but they would seem to have been little more than mountain torrents: the most important of them were Charieis, Chobus or Cobus, Singames, Tarsuras, Hippus, Astelephus, Chrysorrhoas, several of which are also noticed by Ptolemy and Pliny. The chief towns were Dioscurias or Dioscuris (under the Romans called Sebastopolis, now Sukhumi) on the seaboard of the Euxine, Sarapana (now Shorapani), <b>Phasis</b> (now Poti), Pityus (now Pitsunda), Apsaros (now Gonio), Surium (now Vani), Archaeopolis (now Nokalakevi), Macheiresis, and Cyta or Cutatisium or Aia (now Kutaisi), the traditional birthplace of Medea. Scylax mentions also Mala or Male, which he, in contradiction to other writers, makes the birthplace of Medea.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Phasis</b> was {{besieged by}} {{forces of the}} Sassanid Empire. Martinus, the overall {{commander}} of the Byzantine troops, had given instructions to the whole army to stay at their respective posts. They were to disregard attempts of the Sassanids to have them exit the fortifications and fight in the open. However, Angilas and Philomathius led about two hundred of their men in opening a town gate. They exited the town and attacked a force of Sassanids whose archers were harassing the defenders. Theodore at first attempted to restrain them. But then bowed down to [...] "majority opinion" [...] and followed them in attacking. He was reportedly reluctant to violate orders, but unwilling to be branded a coward by the soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|Surely {{aware of}} the sea's convexity, he may have {{designed}} his map on a slightly rounded metal surface. The centre or “navel” of the world ( [...] omphalós gẽs) could have been Delphi, but is more likely in Anaximander's time to have been located near Miletus. The Aegean Sea was near the map's centre and enclosed by three continents, themselves located {{in the middle of}} the ocean and isolated like islands by sea and rivers. Europe was bordered on the south by the Mediterranean Sea and was separated from Asia by the Black Sea, the Lake Maeotis, and, further east, either by the <b>Phasis</b> River (now called the Rioni) or the Tanais. The Nile flowed south into the ocean, separating Libya (which was the name for the part of the then-known African continent) from Asia.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{words have}} unusually formed {{singular}}s and plurals, but develop [...] "normal" [...] singular-plural pairs by back-formation. [...] For example, pease (modern peas) was in origin a singular with plural peasen. [...] However, pease {{came to be}} analysed as plural by analogy, from which a new singular pea was formed; the spelling of pease was also altered accordingly, surviving only {{in the name of}} the dish pease porridge or pease pudding. [...] Similarly, termites was the three-syllable plural of termes; this singular was lost, however, and the plural form reduced to two syllables. [...] Syringe is a back-formation from syringes, itself the plural of syrinx, a musical instrument. Cherry is from Norman French cherise. [...] Phases was once the plural of <b>phasis,</b> but the singular is now phase. The nonstandard, offensive, and now obsolete Chinee and Portugee singulars are back-formations from the standard Chinese and Portuguese.|$|E

60|$|For {{ourselves}} we {{answer that}} French Revolution means here the open violent Rebellion, and Victory, of disimprisoned Anarchy against corrupt worn-out Authority: how Anarchy breaks prison; bursts {{up from the}} infinite Deep, and rages uncontrollable, immeasurable, enveloping a world; in <b>phasis</b> after <b>phasis</b> of fever-frenzy;--'till the frenzy burning itself out, and what elements of new Order it held (since all Force holds such) developing themselves, the Uncontrollable be got, if not reimprisoned, yet harnessed, and its mad forces made to work towards their object as sane regulated ones. For as Hierarchies and Dynasties of all kinds, Theocracies, Aristocracies, Autocracies, Strumpetocracies, have ruled over the world; so it was appointed, in the decrees of Providence, that this same Victorious Anarchy, Jacobinism, Sansculottism, French Revolution, Horrors of French Revolution, or what else mortals name it, should have its turn.

6000|$|... § 3. A Feeling and a State of {{consciousness}} are, {{in the language}} of philosophy, equivalent expressions: every thing is a feeling of which the mind is conscious; every thing which it feels, or, in other words, which forms a part of its own sentient existence. In popular language Feeling is not always synonymous with State of Consciousness; being often taken more peculiarly for those states which are conceived as belonging to the sensitive, or to the emotional, <b>phasis</b> of our nature, and sometimes, with a still narrower restriction, to the emotional alone, as distinguished from what are conceived as belonging to the percipient or to the intellectual <b>phasis.</b> But this is an admitted departure from correctness of language; just as, by a popular perversion the exact converse of this, the word Mind is withdrawn from its rightful generality of signification, and restricted to the intellect. The still greater perversion by which Feeling is sometimes confined not only to bodily sensations, but to the sensations of a single sense, that of touch, needs not be more particularly adverted to.|$|E

6000|$|The most {{interesting}} <b>phasis</b> which the Reformation anywhere assumes, especially for us English, {{is that of}} Puritanism. In Luther's own country Protestantism soon dwindled into a rather barren affair: not a religion or faith, but rather now a theological jangling of argument, the proper seat of it not the heart; the essence of it sceptical contention: which indeed has jangled more and more, down to Voltaireism itself,--through Gustavus-Adolphus contentions onwards to French-Revolution ones! But in our Island there arose a Puritanism, which even got itself established as a Presbyterianism and National Church among the Scotch; which came forth as a real business of the heart; and has produced in the world very notable fruit. In some senses, one may say {{it is the only}} <b>phasis</b> of Protestantism that ever got to the rank of being a Faith, a true heart-communication with Heaven, and of exhibiting itself in History as such. We must spare a few words for Knox; himself a brave and remarkable man; but still more important as Chief Priest and Founder, which one may consider him to be, of the Faith that became Scotland's, New England's, Oliver Cromwell's.
