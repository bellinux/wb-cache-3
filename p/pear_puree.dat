40|$|The {{effect of}} ohmic {{treatment}} on some quality related characteristics of <b>pear</b> <b>purée</b> (cv. ‘Conference’) such as color, reducing sugars, total phenols, rheological behavior and microbial counts, was analyzed. The inactivation kinetics of pectin methyl esterase (PME) in pear crude extract and purée were studied by conventional thermal and ohmic treatments. Thermal inactivation of PME in crude extract {{was described by}} a first-order kinetic model. The activation energy values suggested the presence of two isoenzymes with different thermostability. The ohmic heating reduced PME activity by 96 % at 25 V·cm - 1. Minimal changes induced by ohmic heating on above quality related aspects were observed. Supporting this statement, {{there were no significant}} changes in the nutritional and sensorial attributes. It was reported an increase of 3 % of reducing sugar content for the ohmic heated samples. The phenolic content of the treated samples registered a reduction of 59 % in comparison with fresh <b>pear</b> <b>purée.</b> The <b>pear</b> <b>purée</b> presented a non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behaviour. The Ostwald de Waele model was fitted to rheograms and the consistency coefficient (m) and flow behavior index (n) were determined. Results obtained for the microbial charge were higher in the control samples. Thus, microbial counts showed complete inactivation of yeast and mold at voltage gradient higher than 17. 5 V·cm - 1. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ohmic heating {{takes its}} name from Ohm’s law. Ohmic heating is an {{alternative}} heating technique, using an electrical current passing through the food product. The food material switched between electrodes has a role of resistance in the circuit. In this study the <b>pear</b> <b>puree</b> made at laboratory scale had been undergone to the ohmic heating process using different voltage gradients (15 / 17 / 17. 5 / 20 V/cm) and different processing time intervals (0 / 3 / 5 / 10 min). It were measured the electrical conductivity, the temperature, electric current intensity, <b>pear</b> <b>puree</b> viscosity {{in order to determine the}} ohmic heating influence over some process and sample properties. After the purpose of study was reached that was found the proportional link between the temperature and electric conductivity increase, which also depends on the processing time. The bubbling temperature was established above the 60 °C value for all the voltage gradients...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{pasteurization}} is {{a technique}} widely utilized in the industry to reduce the microbial content of foods and increase their shelf life. The food pasteurization is commonly carried out in continuous process where the food undergoes to a rapid heating and a subsequent cooling with high heat transfer coefficients {{in order to reduce}} the degradation of main constituents like proteins and vitamins, and keeping almost unchanged the food organoleptic properties. Continuous pasteurization processes are commonly used to treat creams, tomato sauce, fruit juice, as well as products with solid particles or pieces like soups or baby foods. In such cases, the presence of dispersed large particles in the fluid can causes issues in the correct process setup. Indeed, the process setup must assure the pasteurization condition in the overall product food, included the centre of the particles. Here the heat penetrates by conduction and usually it becomes the actual limiting step of the process. In this work we estimate the pasteurization condition for a pilot scale pasteurization process for the thermal treatment of <b>pear</b> <b>puree</b> with pieces by the use of the Computational Fluid Dynamic approach. The results show that the heat penetration resistance into the solid particle reduces of about 32 % the microbial abatement in the particle centre; however the P 85 value results always higher than the minimum required for the food pasteurization.

40|$|Strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides were {{identified}} from raw prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica L.). Five autochthonous strains were {{selected based on}} the kinetics of growth and acidification on prickly pear fruit juice, {{and the capacity to}} synthesize exo-polysaccharides. All selected Leuc. mesenteroides strains showed an in vitro mucilage-degrading capability. A protocol for processing and storage of fermented prickly <b>pear</b> fruit <b>puree</b> (FP) was set up. Unstarted FP and chemically acidified FP were used as the controls. Starters grew and remained viable at elevated cell numbers during 21 days of storage at 4 °C. Contaminating Enterobacteriaceae and yeasts were found only in the controls. Viscosity and serum separation distinguished started FP compared to the controls. Colour parameters, browning index, sensory attributes, antimicrobial activity, vitamin C and betalains levels were positively affected by lactic acid fermentation. Increase of free radical scavenging activity in ethyl acetate soluble extract suggested an effect of selected strains on phenolic profiles. Started FP markedly inhibited the inflammatory status of Caco- 2 /TC 7 cells, and also contributed to maintaining the integrity of tight junctions. Started FP scavenged the reactive oxygen species generated by H 2 O 2 on Caco- 2 cells. All selected strain variously affected the immunomodulatory activity towards anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines...|$|R
40|$|A {{rapid and}} simple method {{to obtain the}} flow {{behaviour}} index and consistency index of food fluids with pseudoplastic flow was developed. This method was compared with the more traditional approach that use the Rabinowitch correction. The comparison was made by using a capillary viscometer assembled on purpose and by testing four different pseudoplastic food fluids: tomato, peach, <b>pear</b> and apricot <b>purees.</b> The difference on the results between the two methods was negligible. The rheological behaviour vs. temperature of the four pseudoplastic food fluids was also determined. The temperature had a pronunced effect on the consistency index, {{but not on the}} flow behaviour index. The magnitude of the consistency index decreased with increase in temperature and the Arrhenius model described well this effect with the average determination coefficient R 2 of 0. 979...|$|R
40|$|Liège syrup is a Belgian {{traditional}} cooked fruit foodstuff, produced {{mainly from}} apples and pears. The process includes {{several hours of}} heating at high temperature during which complex chemical reactions occur, such as Maillard condensation between reducing sugars and amino acids. Aiming at understanding the modifications of the fruit juices during heating, different parameters were monitored throughout the process. It was shown that hydoxymethylfurfural was formed during {{the first step of}} concentration by heating. At the end of the process, hydroxymethylfurfural had totally disappeared and the deep brown color of the product suggested that this compound was transformed into melanoidins. A parallel increase in antioxidant capacity was also observed. To determine optimal conditions to reach high melanoidin content and high antioxidant capacity, different in vitro model systems were compared. It was shown that different combinations of an amino acid with glucose or fructose led to different levels of hydroxymethyfurfural, of melanoidins and antioxidant capacity. After heating of apple or <b>pear</b> <b>puree,</b> an increase of the antioxidant capacity and the hydroxymethylfurfural and melanoidin contents was observed when the heating time was doubled. An increase of the pH from 5 to 9 in apple marmalade’s also induced an increase in antioxidant capacity and in hydroxymethylfurfural and melanoidins. However it was not the case in pear marmalade where only the increase in antioxidant capacity was observed. These results suggest that some parameters of the processing could be modified to improve the health-promoting effect of this traditional food (antioxidant properties and composition in hydroxymethylfurfural and melanoidins). The main factors affecting the quality of the final product were the cooking times, the temperature, the pH, the addition of reducing sugars or amino acids. Peer reviewe...|$|E
