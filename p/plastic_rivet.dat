5000|$|Another uniquely {{designed}} CD case {{was for a}} CD released in the UK called [...] "The Apple EP", which contained four tracks, each performed by artists signed to Apple Records. The case, which was made of three pieces of cardboard, was shaped like an apple, and was held together by a <b>plastic</b> <b>rivet.</b> This allowed {{each of the three}} pieces to fan out and rotate. The CD itself was housed in the centre of the second piece of cardboard.|$|E

2500|$|The front {{fuselage}} {{was built}} on four tubular longerons, but from leading edge rearwards it consisted {{of a set of}} oval formers with stringers. [...] The greatest novelty of the P.10 was that this part of the fuselage was not only a monocoque structure (still fairly unusual at the time), but a monocoque of steel with a load-bearing <b>plastic</b> skin <b>riveted</b> between the formers and stringers. [...] Specifically, the plastic was Bakelite-Dilecto, a hard, synthetic cellulose-formaldehyde product. [...] The company claimed it was proof against fire, heat, humidity and insects. [...] This was the first use of structural plastic in an airframe and perhaps the last for another sixty years.|$|R
5000|$|The Aluminium A5 Coupé is a {{prototype}} vehicle demonstrating the aluminium Audi Space Frame (ASF) concept. It {{is based on}} Audi A5 Coupé 2.0 TFSI with [...] engine, but it uses the aluminium Audi Space Frame, aluminium and carbon fibre-reinforced <b>plastics</b> body. Punch <b>riveting,</b> bonding or laser-MIG hybrid welding replaced spot welding. The vehicle is 110 kg lighter than the equivalent steel-bodied production model.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Many {{methods can}} be used to {{assemble}} large mechanical structures. Using rivets is one of these methods. Rivets are lighter than bolts and allows for efficient assembly. The cylindrical structure has a discontinuous rivet assembled region. So concentration load operates in the edge of discontinuous assembled region. This paper evaluates the force placed upon rivets used to assemble cylindrical structures and strength of structures assembled with <b>rivets.</b> <b>Plastic</b> deformation of <b>rivets</b> occurs at 4 kN and rivets are destroyed at 7 kN. However, rivets are designed to transfer load to neighboring rivets when they are overloaded. Structural test were accomplished using tension and bending load condition. The structural tests showed that plastic deformation first occurs in the fastening where the rivet meets the outside of the cylinder and a number of rivets exhibited this type of deformation. The secondary phase of deformation occurs in the fastening where the rivet meets the inside of the cylinder. Despite the plastic deformation, the structural tests showed that the rivets succeeded in redistributing load to neighboring rivets and as a result, no rivets were destroyed...|$|R
5000|$|Rimless glasses lenses {{are held}} in place (or [...] "mounted") {{by way of a}} series of screws, or hollow <b>plastic</b> double <b>rivets</b> (called [...] "{{bushings}}" [...] or [...] "compression plugs") that fit into two holes in the lens. When bushings are used, the temples and bridge have barbed metal pins that lock into the bushings, creating a pressure seal that holds the lenses in place. Although they are more cosmetically appealing, the bushing method is more fragile than the screw and nut method, and more difficult for laypersons to repair themselves in the event of loosening or breakage. Bushing based rimless mounts are, however, designed so that the pins can pull out of the lenses without causing damage, which reduces repair cost and duration.|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} work, process-related thermo-{{mechanical}} {{changes in the}} rivet microstructure, joint local and global mechanical properties, and their correlation with the <b>rivet</b> <b>plastic</b> deformation regime were investigated for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (rivet) and glass-fiber-reinforced polyester (GF-P) friction-riveted joints of a single polymeric base plate. Joints displaying similar quasi-static mechanical performance to conventional bolted joints were selected for detailed characterization. The mechanical performance was assessed on lap shear specimens, whereby the friction-riveted joints were connected with AA 2198 gussets. Two levels of energy input were used, resulting in process temperatures varying from 460 ± 130 °C to 758 ± 56 °C and fast cooling rates (178 ± 15 °C/s, 59 ± 15 °C/s). A complex final microstructure was identified in the rivet. Whereas equiaxial α-grains with β-phase precipitated in their grain boundaries were identified in the rivet heat-affected zone, refined α′ martensite, Widmanstätten structures and β-fleck domains {{were present in the}} plastically deformed rivet volume. The transition from equiaxed to acicular structures resulted in an increase of up to 24 % in microhardness in comparison to the base material. A study on the rivet material flow through microtexture of the α-Ti phase and β-fleck orientation revealed a strong effect of shear stress and forging which induced simple shear deformation. By combining advanced microstructural analysis techniques with local mechanical testing and temperature measurement, the nature of the complex <b>rivet</b> <b>plastic</b> deformational regime could be determined...|$|R
50|$|In laboratories, {{spatulas}} and microspatulas {{are small}} stainless steel utensils, used for scraping, transferring, or applying powders and paste like chemicals or treatments. Many spatula brands are also resistant to acids, bases, heat, and solvents, which make them {{ideal for use}} {{with a wide range}} of compound. A common type would be stainless steel spatulas, which are widely used because they are sturdy and affordable. They are resistant to deterioration from contact with boiling water, acids, bases, and most solvents. Some of them come with Polyvinyl chloride <b>plastic</b> handle or <b>riveted</b> hardwood for better handling. Polystyrene spatulas are made for researchers because they are disposable, preventing any potential contaminations which occurs often with reusable spatulas. They are also ideal for handling lyophilized products or performing lyophilization.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1950s, however, {{manufacturing}} shortcuts {{have resulted}} in a quality decline of machetes. Today, most modern factory-made machetes are of very simple construction, consisting of a blade and full-length tang punched from a single piece of flat steel plate of uniform thickness (and thus lack a primary grind), and a simple grip of two plates of wood or <b>plastic</b> bolted or <b>riveted</b> together around the tang. Finally, both sides are ground down to a rough edge so that the purchaser can sharpen the blade to their specific geometry using a file. These machetes are occasionally provided with a simple cord loop as a sort of lanyard, and a canvas scabbard - although in some regions where machetes are valuable, commonly used tools, the users may make decorative leather scabbards for them.|$|R
40|$|Metal forming {{technology}} {{has been applied to}} effective production of metallic components in various fields. One of the newer metal forming techniques is so called „joining by forming“. With this method two or more separate parts are joined together using <b>plastic</b> deformation. Self-piercing <b>riveting,</b> clinching and coin and medal production are some of the joining by forming operations, which have been successfully applied in industry. The present study is bound to a process of joining of two bimetallic axisymmetric components from various materials by upsetting bimetallic components in a closed die. The external component is a ring and the central part is a cylinder – like element. By upsetting those two elements in closed die, inseparable workpiece has been obtained. Therefore, two different cases (geometries) have been investigated. In the first case the simple ring and profiled inner cylinder are combined while in the second case vice versa combination is applied. Also, forming load, material flow and filling of joint section were analyzed. The process has been investigated experimentally. In short, current investigation has yielded considerable insight into the process of joining two metallic components...|$|R
50|$|The station, {{designed}} by architects V. Gnevyshev, N.Aloshkin and T.Tselikovska presents {{itself as a}} deep-level pylon trivault. In the design, {{the shape of the}} vaults is made dominant, by continuing their curvature {{all the way to the}} floor level. This makes the overall appearance of the station lacking pylons, but instead there are even, geometric openings which offer passageways to the adjacent platform vaults. The portals of the openings are punctuated with indents that run along their edges. The station contains a rich combination of decorative materials. Green marble is used for the sides of the passageways, and the lower part of the pylons. White marble is used for the station walls and indents along the portal edges. The ceilings are made from aluminium planes that run perpendicular to the platform length. Lighting comes from a single (platform halls) or double (central) rows of continuous fluorescent elements that are neatly covered by <b>plastic.</b> Floor is <b>riveted</b> with red granite on the platforms and grey granite in the centre of the central hall. In the back end of the station, is a decorative image of a church in a Ukrainian Baroque style. Dorohozhychi is one of the last stations to be built in what is known as the rich post-Soviet decoration. This was done deliberately to mark the transition of the Kiev Metro into the 21st century, as the large use of marble, wooden benches and the large empty space were all considered to be archaic for contemporary station design. All subsequent stations turned to more aesthetic high-tech themes.|$|R
