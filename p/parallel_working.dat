40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} is to present a new model to extend the {{workspace}} of a <b>parallel</b> <b>working</b> machine in a chosen direction. Therefore, the existing mathematical models are com-bined and developed to represent the extension of the workspace of a 6 ◦ <b>parallel</b> <b>working</b> machine. For this purpose, the 6 - 3 Stewart platform mechanism (SPM), which is commonly used in robotic applications, material processing, and flight simulation, and the 6 - 4 SPM have been chosen. Although there are many studies on parallel mechanisms, the workspace analysis of a <b>parallel</b> <b>working</b> mechanism has not yet been generalized. This study determines the workspace of a <b>parallel</b> <b>working</b> mechanism in the direction perpendicular to the moving platform, which is the most workable direction. For these types of working mechanisms, i. e. mechanical tools used for material processing that is forced to move in a certain chosen direction, the determination of the point in that direction at which the workspace is maximum has to be outlined. After carrying out a kinematic analysis, the discretization method, which is based on Euler angles, is used to represent the orientation workspace of these <b>parallel</b> <b>working</b> mechanisms. Additionally, the orientation workspaces of the 6 - 3 SPM and the 6 - 4 SPM are compared. Results are presented in a cylindrical coordinate system...|$|E
