25|$|Plings {{are also}} used in Acorn RISC OS to denote an {{application}} directory: a folder that when double clicked executes a <b>program</b> <b>file</b> inside called !Run. Other files in the appfolder generally contain resources the application needs to run. The appfolder {{can be viewed as}} a normal folder by double-clicking with the shift key held down. In addition, other special resource files such as !Boot (executed the first time the application containing it comes into view of the filer), !Sprites (an icon file containing icon definitions loaded if !Boot cannot be found) and !Help (a text, HTML or other executable file listed in the filer menu for the application) also start with a pling.|$|E
2500|$|File {{names were}} {{specified}} as {{a string of}} up to eight characters, followed by a period, followed by a file name extension of up to three characters ("8.3" [...] filename format). The extension usually identified the type of the file. For example, [...]COM indicated an executable <b>program</b> <b>file,</b> and [...]TXT indicated a file containing ASCII text.|$|E
2500|$|The Trojan {{horse was}} posted to {{websites}} {{of interest to}} pedophiles {{in a way that}} it appeared to be a picture-file attached to a message, but was actually a <b>program</b> <b>file.</b> When a visitor to the pedophile website downloaded the file, the visitor unwittingly downloaded the Trojan horse, and would typically be unaware that it was running on his or her computer. Willman had no control over who chose to download the Trojan horse. Once it had been downloaded, Willman could access, search, and retrieve files from the infected computer. Willman stated [...] "My whole intent, after the program started working as I expected it to, was to help kids." [...] Willman estimated that his Trojan Horse gave him access to between 2,000 and 3,000 computers that had been used to visit websites of interest to pedophiles, including those of police officers, military personnel, social workers, priests, and judges.|$|E
50|$|There are two <b>Program</b> <b>Files</b> {{directories}} each {{visible to}} both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. The directory that stores the 32 bit <b>files</b> is called <b>Program</b> <b>Files</b> (x86) {{to differentiate between}} the two, while the 64 bit maintains the traditional <b>Program</b> <b>Files</b> name without any additional qualifier.|$|R

50|$|Other {{metadata}} includes:the name of {{the creator}} of the original version of the <b>program</b> <b>file</b> and the date when the first version was created,the {{name of the}} current maintainer of the program,the names of other people who have edited the <b>program</b> <b>file</b> so far,the URL of documentation about how to use the program,the name of the software license for this program file,etc.|$|E

50|$|<b>Program</b> <b>Files</b> is the {{directory}} {{name of a}} standard folder in Microsoft Windows operating systems in which applications that {{are not part of}} the operating system are conventionally installed. Typically, each application installed under the 'Program Files' directory will have a subdirectory for its application-specific resources. Shared resources, for example resources used by multiple applications from one company, are typically stored in the Common <b>Program</b> <b>Files</b> directory.|$|R

50|$|Developers {{also use}} icon editors to make icons for {{specific}} program files. Assignment of an icon to a newly created program is usually done within the Integrated Development Environment {{used to develop}} that program. However, if one is creating an application in the Windows API {{he or she can}} simply add a line to the program's resource script before compilation. Many icon editors can copy a unique icon from a <b>program</b> <b>file</b> for editing. Only a few can assign an icon to a <b>program</b> <b>file,</b> a much more difficult task.|$|E

50|$|The icon that Windows {{displays}} for a <b>program</b> <b>file</b> {{is actually}} the first icon resource in its EXE file. If the EXE file has no icon resources, a standard icon is displayed.|$|E
5000|$|Up to 9 local {{variables}} {{for each mode}} of operation and equation, solver or <b>program</b> <b>file,</b> with user defined names. Unlike the 28 global ones, using these local variables consumes user RAM.|$|E
5000|$|Separation of the {{operating}} system (OS) and <b>program</b> <b>files</b> from user files. This allows image backups (or clones) {{to be made of}} only {{the operating}} system and installed software.|$|R
5000|$|User Account Control {{also has}} a {{mechanism}} for dealing with [...] "older" [...] <b>programs</b> that write <b>files</b> to specific areas, on [...] "newer" [...] windows. Files written from a process without administrator privileges to protected locations, such as <b>Program</b> <b>Files</b> and windows\system32, will be redirected to a virtual store directory.|$|R
50|$|Besides defragmenting <b>program</b> <b>files,</b> the defragmenting tool {{can also}} reduce {{the time it takes}} to load <b>programs</b> and open <b>files.</b> For example, the Windows 9x defragmenter {{included}} the Intel Application Launch Accelerator which optimized programs on the disk by placing the defragmented <b>program</b> <b>files</b> and their dependencies next to each other, in the order of which the program loads them, to load these programs faster. At the beginning of the hard drive, the outer tracks have a higher transfer rate than the inner tracks. Placing frequently accessed files onto the outer tracks increases performance. Third party defragmenters, such as MyDefrag, will move frequently accessed files onto the outer tracks and defragment these files.|$|R
50|$|An object element may be {{executed}} {{if it is}} a main program or linked with other object elements including a main program. The linking may be static or dynamic. A main program may {{be executed}} without pre-linking provided all required sub-programs are in the same <b>program</b> <b>file,</b> are system libraries, or are otherwise known. Rules may be included in a <b>program</b> <b>file</b> to direct the dynamic linker’s search for unfulfilled references. The linker may also be used to statically link multiple object modules together to form a new object module containing all instructions, data, and other information in the original object modules.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{malicious}} {{programs designed to}} look like Spybot-S&D (and other anti-malware software), with similar user interfaces and <b>program</b> <b>file</b> names. Some actually install spyware. These programs are known as rogue antispyware.|$|E
