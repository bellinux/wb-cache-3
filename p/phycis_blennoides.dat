40|$|Background. The greater forkbeard, <b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides</b> (Brünnich, 1768), is a gadiform species, {{which has}} {{economical}} value and its population is dwelling in a 60 – 800 m depth range throughout the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Along African north coast, {{there is a}} lack of information about the biology (age, growth, sex-ratio) of this species. This study provides the first data on population parameters of P. blennoides in Tunisia. Materials and Methods. Specimens of <b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides</b> were collected from the landings of the artisanal fisheries between September 2007 and June 2010. The length–weight relations were determined according to the allometric equation: W = aTLb. Growth parameters were estimated using the von Bertalanffy growth equation. Results. Length (TL) –Weight (W) relations were allometrically positive for the females (W = 22. 10 – 4 TL 3. 409), males (W = 13. 10 – 4 TL 3. 674), and both sexes (W = 19. 10 – 4 TL 3. 460), without significant differences between males and females. The relation between otolith weight and age showed a significant difference between males and females. The growth parameters were calculated as TL∞ = 57. 17 cm, K = 0. 193 · year– 1, t 0 = – 1. 578 · year for the females, and 44. 74 cm, 0. 313 · year– 1, and – 1. 210 · year for the males, respectively. The females grew faster than the males which did not exceed 45 cm. The growth performance index Ф' calculated for the females (2. 80 cm· year – 1) and males (2. 79 cm· year – 1) yielded similar results. Conclusion. Results reported in this work will contribute to the knowledge on the biology of P. blennoides in Tunisia, with the aim of generating sufficient information to improve future stock management and sustainable fisheries...|$|E

The highest mean levels of total mercury were detected in conger eel (0. 80 μg g- 1) and in starry ray (0. 75 μg g- 1). Forkbeard (0. 67 μ g g- 1), frostfish (0. 59 gμ g- 1) and striped mullet (0. 55 μg g- 1) showed slightly lower levels, while red gurnard (0. 33 μg g- 1) and yellow gurnard (0. 22 μg g- 1) exhibited the lowest concentrations. The results of the linear regression analysis showed significant relationship between mercury concentrations and fish size for all species. Consequently, dietary consumption of larger size specimens leaded to an increase in the exposure level for consumer. Understanding by consumers of all factors leading to an increase of exposure to mercury is the first step to address them to make decisions about eating fish...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Existing {{information}} on the ichthyofauna of the Eastern Ionian Sea (Greece) was enriched by a recent research project carried out in its northern part at depths ranging from 300 to 1200 m. The frequency of occurrence of the identified fish species and their abundance were examined. In total, 101 fish species were identified. Their number and abundance decreased significantly with depth. Argentina sphyraena presented the highest frequency of occurrence and Chlorophthalmus agassizi the highest abundance at depths ranging between 300 and 500 m. In the depth zone 500 - 700 m, Chlorophthalmus agassizi predominated in abundance and <b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides</b> in frequency of occurrence. In the zone 700 - 900 m, Galeus melastomus and Nezumia sclerorhynchus showed both the highest abundance and frequency of occurrence. These two species were also the most abundant at depths 900 - 1200 m, whereas Lampanyctus crocodilus was the most frequently encountered. Four species (Benthocometes robustus, Mic-roichthys coccoi, Nemichthys scolopaceus and Epigonus constanciae) are reported {{for the first time}} in Greek waters, and twenty species are reported {{for the first time in}} the Greek Ionian Sea.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between the abundance of demersal resources, environmental variables, and fishing pressure in the northwestern Ionian Sea {{in the last two}} decades were evaluated. Data on the density collected during seventeen trawl surveys carried out from 1985 to 2005 were used. The following species were considered: Aristaeomorpha foliacea, Nephrops norvegicus, and Parapenaeus longirostris for crustaceans; Merluccius merluccius, <b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides,</b> and Mullus barbatus for teleost fish. The recruitment index was also considered for N. norvegicus, P. longirostris, M. merluccius and Mullus barbatus. Six candidate models were evaluated for each density and recruitment data set either combining fishing effort with global (NAO) and regional (SST and precipitation) climatic indices, or models separately involving fishing effort, NAO, or regional climatic indices as the only predictive variable. Model selection was carried out using an information-theoretical approach that applies Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC). High changes over time were observed for the density data and recruitment indices in each species. Apart from hake abundance and recruitment data, for which a clear positive relationship with the NAO index alone was detected, the changes observed in the other species seem to be the consequence of the interaction between bottom-up effects linked to changes in physical environment and top-down ones due to the fishing pressure...|$|E

In order to determine if this theory applied to deep-sea species from an important fishing ground (the Blanes submarine canyon) located in the NW Mediterranean, we sampled the commercial fish <b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides</b> and Micromesistius poutassou and the crustacean Aristeus antennatus. Specimens were sampled inside and outside (in the open continental slope) the submarine canyon; both {{are regarded}} as potentially affected by exposure to different anthropogenic chemicals. Several pollution biomarkers in muscle (activity of cholinesterases) and liver/hepatopancreas (catalase, glutathione S-transferases, carboxylesterases, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase in fish or mixed function oxygenase (MFO) -related reductases in crustacean, and lipid peroxidation levels) were measured. Chemical analysis of the persistent organic pollutants, namely polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) was also performed on the fish and crustacean muscle. Biomarker activities and levels were discussed in relation to pollutant exposure, habitat, and parameters including sex, size, and species. Biochemical responses and chemical analysis of PCBs evidenced interspecies differences as well as sex and size-related ones, mainly in A. antennatus. An indication of higher exposure to pollutants inside the canyon was observed, which was more clearly reflected in the fish than in the crustacean. However, further research is required to confirm this observation...|$|E

Amongst these, the eye size range was 0. 15 to 0. 35 of head length with {{a value of}} 0. 19 for C. (N.) armatus, the deepest species. Brain morphology reflected behavioural differences with well-developed olfactory regions in P. blennoides, T. murrayi and C.

All species had a clearly defined optic tectum with 2 -[125 I]iodomelatonin binding and melatonin receptor gene expression localized to specific brain regions in a similar pattern to that found in shallow-water fish. Melatonin receptors were found throughout the visual structures of the brains of all species.

To help fill this gap, we sampled hake (Merluccius merluccius) and Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) in fishing grounds off the coast of l'Ametlla de Mar (NW Mediterranean) in June 2005 at a depth of 100 in and 400 in. Additionally, at 400 in depth, two other fish species, Micromesistius poutassou and <b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides</b> were included. Neurotoxicity markers such as Colinesterases (ChEs), namely acethyl- (AChE), butyryl- (BChE), propionyl- (PrChE) and carboxilesterase (CbE) were measured in muscle. Lipid peroxidation (LP), a marker of oxidative damage, was also included. The results are discussed in relation to the animal's sex, size and fishing depth. A comparison of esterases and LP levels between muscle and liver of hake and between muscle and hepatopancreas of Norway Lobster was made. AChE was dominant in muscle and CbE in hepatopancreas. No differences between fish species were seen for AChE. However, N. norvegicus, presented lower levels of ChEs and LP. A size-dependence in ChEs was seen for M. merluccius, with larger animals showing significantly lower activities (p < 0. 05). Sex-dependence was seen in N. norvegicus for most esterases, except AChE, with males displaying higher activities (p < 0. 05). A sampling-depth effect was also seen in the crustacea, with animals from 100 in generally presenting lower esterase activities and higher LP levels. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of deep-sea {{reproductive}} {{biology is}} slight and interpretations of reproductive strategies in deep-sea fishes are controversial. Since the Mediterranean {{is a fairly}} stable and constant sea, we might expect a consistent pattern of reproduction of deep-sea species. Three gadiforms species with a succesive bathymetric and an ecological and economical importance in the Mediterranean fishing industry, <b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides,</b> Mora moro and Lepidion lepidion, were selected for the present study. These three species of gadiforms are sexually dimorphic and their reproductive population {{is located at the}} lower zone of their bathymetric range. Females were always bigger than males. The smallest mature male was observed at 19, 32 and 18 cm TL (total length) and the smallest mature female at 20, 34 and 20 cm TL for P. blennoides, M. moro and L. lepidion respectively. The three species are iteroparous and females could be all-at-once or batch-spawners. An autumn mature season was observed for P. blennoides, whereas M. moro and L. lepidion had mature individuals all year round except in summer. Hence, physical constancy at greater depths is able to lengthen the reproductive season and the deepest species has a quasi-continuous reproductive pattern. Similar reproductive tissues have been found in the three species studied, and they show analogous structure with other deep-sea gadiforms and their shallow-water congeners.

40|$|A {{long-term}} lander {{employing a}} baited camera system {{was developed to}} study temporal variation {{in the presence of}} scavenging fish and invertebrates at a cold-water coral community on Galway Mound (Belgica Mound Province, NE Atlantic). The camera system was tested during two successful long-term deployments for periods of 6 and 12 months respectively. The baited system, consisting of two separate video cameras with infrared lights and a bait dispenser with 24 bait positions, recorded more than 15, 500 clips of 17 s, regularly spread over both periods. New bait, consisting of sardines in oil, was offered at regular time intervals, and attracted scavengers over the whole period of deployment, and especially the crab Chaceon affinis did still eat from it till the end of the deployments. However, the attractiveness for some scavengers, i. e. amphipods, diminished quite quickly. In addition to invertebrate scavengers, namely C. affinis, two other crab species, amphipods, a shrimp and a starfish, also 7 species of fish were recorded near the bait, of which Lepidion eques was by far the most common. Though there was no concrete evidence for seasonal patterns, the observations showed substantial temporal variation in the abundance of several species, especially the crabs C. affinis and Bathynectes maravigna and the fish <b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides.</b> It is concluded that long-term deployments of such a baited camera system can produce novel data. For instance such a system could be employed for monitoring impacts of disturbances on the deep-sea floor (e. g. mining), as we infer that mobile scavengers will be among the first organisms to show a visible reaction to any chemically and physically (noise, vibrations) alteration of the environment similar to a mine canary...|$|E
40|$|Potential for new {{developments}} in deep water fishing have been identified by two sampling surveys carried out in April and September 1993, in the deep waters off {{the west coast of}} Ireland and Scotland. The primary objective of the two surveys was to secure samples of a variety of potentially commercial deep water fish species in order to examine aspects of their age, growth, reproduction and diet. These data will be essential in formulating management plans for the expanding deep water fisheries in the area. The surveys were conducted on a chartered fishing vessel using a commercial otter trawl, fitted with a small mesh cod-end liner. Fishing activity concentrated on the depth range 400 m- 1200 m and a total of 81 trawling operations were carried out, of which 75 produced fish catches with limited gear damage. Fifteen species of cartilaginous and 50 species of teleost fish were recorded from the catches. These include the roundnose grenadier Coryphaenoides rupestris, black scabbard Aphanopus carbo, greater forkbeard <b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides,</b> blue-mouth rockfish Helicolenus dactylopterus and Baird's smooth-head Alepocephalus bairdii. Length, weight, sex, maturity and catch data together with samples of otoliths, gonads and stomachs were secured. In general terms, the fishing ground off the north west of Ireland and west of Scotland caused little problems with gear damage and yielded good catches of deep water species. The two surveys have shown the areas have potential for commercial deep water fishing but the development of this fishery in the area will be contingent on the establishment of suitable markets.

Using a multi-beam echo sounder, side-scan sonar, high-resolution seismics and underwater video, the zones were identified for the sampling demersal fauna without damaging the coral colonies. During September-October 2005 experimental samplings were carried out with longlines and trawl nets inside the coral habitat and outside, where fishery exploitation occurs. No significant differences were shown between the abundance of fish recorded using longlines in the coral and non-coral habitat even though some selachians and teleosts were more abundant in the former than in the latter. Large specimens of rockfish (Helicolenus dactylopterus) and blackspot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo) were commonly caught using longlines in the coral habitat. Data from trawling revealed refuge effects in the coral habitat and fishing effects outside. Significant differences were detected between the recorded abundances in the two study areas. Greater densities and biomasses were obtained inside the coral area, and fish size spectra and size distributions indicate a greater abundance of large fish inside the coral habitat. The SML coral habitat is a spawning area for H. dactylopterus. The remarkable density of the young-of-the-year of the deep-water shark Ennopterus spinax {{as well as of}} Merluccius merluccius, Micromesistius poutassou, <b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides</b> and H. dactylopterus, indicates that the coral habitat also acts as nursery area for these demersal species, which are exploited outside. Considering the evidence of the negative impact of bottom trawling and, to a lesser extent, of longlining, the coral banks can provide a refuge for the conservation of unique species and habitats as well as in providing benefit to adjacent fisheries through the spill-over effect both of eggs, larvae, juveniles and adults.

40|$|Monthly catches {{per unit}} of effort (CPUE) of adult red shrimp (. Aristeus antennatus), {{reported}} in the deep water bottom trawl fishery developed on the Sóller fishing ground off northern Mallorca (Western Mediterranean), and the mean ocean surface vorticity in the surrounding areas are compared between 2000 and 2010. A good correlation is found between the rises in the surrounding surface vorticity and the drops in the CPUE of the adult red shrimp. This correlation {{could be explained by}} assuming that most of the surface vorticity episodes could reach the bottom, increasing the seabed velocities and producing sediment resuspension, which could affect the near bottom water turbidity. A. antennatus would respond to this increased turbidity disappearing from the fishing grounds, probably moving downwards to the deeper waters. This massive displacement of red shrimp specimens away from the fishing grounds would consequently decrease their accessibility to fishing exploitation. Similar although more intense responses have been observed during the downslope shelf dense water current episodes that occurred in a submarine canyon, northeast of the Iberian peninsula. The proposed mechanism suggesting how the surface vorticity observed can affect the bottom sediments is investigated using a year-long moored near-bottom current meter and a sediment trap moored near the fishing grounds. The relationship between vorticity and catches is also explored for fish species (. Galeus melastomus, Micromesistius poutassou, <b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides)</b> and other crustacean (. Geryon longipes and Nephrops norvegicus), considered as by-catch of the deep water fishery in the area. Results appear to support the suggestion that the water turbidity generated by the vorticity episodes is significant enough to affect the dynamics of the demersal species. © 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The joint {{analysis}} of data from different programs represents {{a good opportunity to}} improve knowledge about the condition of any exploited populations. This note investigates the influence of lag-time in sample characteristics (growth rate and recruitment) by following a simple and quick exploratory procedure. In order to illustrate this approach, the Greater Fork-beard (<b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides</b> Brunnich, 1768), a species with discrete recruitment pattern and available to the capture process {{in the first years of}} life, was considered. The length-frequency distributions (LFD), obtained during five spring (MEDITS - International) and successive autumn (GRUND - Italian) bottom trawl surveys, conducted from 1994 to 1998, in the Strait of Sicily and Southern Tyrrhenian Sea (Mediterranean) were analysed. The procedure was divided into three steps. Firstly, the LFD were analysed in order to estimate the mean length of the first component in each survey. Secondly, for each survey, the difference between the standardized mean lengths of the first components in the LFD of the two areas was compared with the corresponding lag-time in order to assess any systematic temporal effect in recruitment periodicity. Thirdly, for each area, the absolute and instantaneous growth rates between the spring and autumn surveys of the same year were computed on the base of the lag-time, to evaluate any difference in growth rate between the areas. The results show that the earlier the surveys begin in the Strait of Sicily, the smaller is the difference in mean length. Since the growth rates between the two areas are practically indistinguishable, the higher mean lengths observed in samples from the Strait of Sicily mainly reflect the lag-time. The reference mean growth rate found (1. 03 and 0. 93 cm per month in the Strait of Sicily and Southern Tyrrhenian Sea, respectively) agreed with the literature. In spring, the recruits of 0 group represent up to 90 % of the whole trawl catch, and the smallest length class observed (4. 5 - 5. 0 cm) is close to the size of transition from the pelagic to the demersal one. The proposed exploratory procedure shows that systematic differences between the two investigated sub-areas in mean size and growth rate suggested by actual data are strongly reduced after having included the lag-time in the analysis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the potential {{role of the}} crinoid Leptometra phalangium {{as an indicator of}} highly productive areas along the shelf break that can sustain large biomasses of benthopelagic fish and recruits. The structure of fish assemblages in the central Mediterranean Sea (central-western coast of Italy), analysed on the basis of surveys carried out in summer and autumn from 1997 to 2001, revealed the presence of a well-defined group of species on the shelf break. This area, occurring at a depth of between 120 and 170 m, is characterised by detritic organogenic sediments colonised by the crinoid L. phalangium, a suspension-feeding macro-epibenthic species confined in the Mediterranean to the shelf-break area. Its abundance in the studied area can reach 12 - 15 ind. m(- 2). A total of 121 species belonging to 66 families of demersal organisms (crustacean decapods and stomatopods, cephalopods, selaceens and teleosteens) were caught at shelf-break stations from September to October. The species which typified the assemblage were the fishes Trisopterus minutus capelanus, Merluccius merluccius, Glossanodon leioglossus, Argentina sphyraena, Capros aper, Macroramphos scolopax and Lepidotrigla cavillone, the crustacean decapod Parapenaeus longirostris and the cephalopods Illex coindetii and Todaropsis eblanae. Detritic shelf-break stations showed a higher abundance of demersal organisms than stations distributed on muddy bottoms in the same depth range (100 - 200 m). Such differences appeared to be significant in September - October, when a clear increase in benthopelagic zooplanktivorus species, such as Glossanodon leioglossus, Trachurus trachurus, Trachurus picturatus, was found. The length structure of species occurring on the shelf break showed that for some of them the selection of this area is related to specific phases of their life cycle. Significant highest abundance of recruits and juveniles was observed for Merluccius merluccius, Helicolenus dactylopterus, <b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides,</b> Parapenaeus longirostris and Capros aper in {{at least one of the}} two seasons. Similarly, an increased abundance of spawners of red mullet Mullus barbatus and four-spotted megrim Lepidorhombus boscii was observed on the shelf break. Results of this study may have important consequences for management of fish stocks and assemblages in the central Mediterranean. The cooccurrence of high densities of L. phalangium and benthopelagic fish, occurring mainly with juveniles and spawners, strongly indicates a potential role of L. phalangium as an indicator of highly productive areas around the shelf break. Such areas appear to play a major role in the production of some of the most abundant and commercially important fish species, such as the Mediterranean hake and red mullet...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{what are}} the best ecological conditions for megafauna associated with the bamboo coral Isidella elongata based on the geomorphological, physical and trophic information taken in 3 stations (St 1, St 2, St 3) off the southern Catalonian coasts at 620 m depth in June 2011. Results were compared with assemblage compositions recorded in past cruises (May 1992, 1994) at the same 3 stations. St 1 was in a fishing ground exploited since the 1940 s over a relatively wide slope at ca. 22 km from the nearest canyon head; St 2 and St 3 were on a narrower slope closer to canyon heads and to the Ebro river mouth than St 1. I. elongata had formed (to May 1994, at least) a dense coral forest at St 2 –St 3 (to ca. 255 colonies/ha at St 3), and some isolated colonies (to ca. 0. 9 colonies/ha) were still collected in 2011. Fish and invertebrate communities significantly differed between St 1 and St 2 /St 3, with two macrourid fishes (Trachrhynchus trachyrhynchus and Nezumia aequalis) and two decapods (Plesionika martia and Plesionika acanthonotus) more abundant at St 2 /St 3. The following ecological indicators imply better food conditions for megafauna at St 2 –St 3 and for I. elongata itself: (i) greater density of zooplankton (copepods, euphausiids, and others) as potential prey for planktivores (including I. elongata); (ii) greater biomass and mean weight of epifaunal and infaunal deposit feeders; (iii) higher feeding intensity, F, at St 3 for benthos feeders (<b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides,</b> N. aequalis and Aristeus antennatus). Also, at St 2 –St 3 we found higher near-bottom turbidity (indicating particle resuspension: food for suspension feeders) and finer and more reduced (Eh) sediments. The results let us suggest that corals and accompanying fauna preferently found optimal ecological conditions in the same habitat, while habitat-forming capacity by I. elongata seemed weak to generate these conditions. Coral forests may enhance detritus accumulations around them, improving habitat conditions for benthos feeders (e. g. macrourid fish). At St 3 our side-scan sonar recorded three types of tracks produced by trawler doors, which match with three identified vessels occasionally operating in the area. After this low fishing activity off the Ebro Delta since the mid- 1990 s, almost all colonies of I. elongata has been removed. However, this impact has hardly altered fish and invertebrate composition without any significant loss of diversity, pointing also toward a rather low capacity of I. elongata facies in forming habitat for megafauna on muddy bottoms of the Mediterranean slope...|$|E
40|$|The Marine Institute {{with the}} {{collaboration}} of the National University of Galway conducted a multidisciplinary deepwater survey along the continental {{slope of the}} Northeast Atlantic. At three selected sites northwest of Ireland and on the northern slopes of the Porcupine Bank, fishing transects were carried out at four depth strata (500 m, 1000 m 1500 m and 1800 m) during the day, while oceanographic measurements and plankton and benthic invertebrate sampling was carried out during the night. Data from CTD and ADCP measurements showed following distribution of water masses: The top 700 m was occupied by that of Eastern North Atlantic Water (ENAW) origin which is a basic feature of the upper layer hydrography in the Rockall Trough; small salinity maxima indicated the region associated with {{the core of the}} shelf edge current (SEC). At Area 6, immediately north of Porcupine Bank, a salinity maximum at a depth of 900 - 1000 m indicated the presence of Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW) with the presence Labrador Sea Water (LSW) at 1800 - 2000 m. The SEC was identified in both CTD and ADCP transects and was characterised by a number of relatively narrow filaments evident in the salinity data. In terms of benthic invertebrate data, a total of 104 taxa were identified with a maximum number of 33 invertebrate taxa identified per haul (these values were recorded at two 1500 m hauls in 2006 and 2007, in Areas 5 and 2, respectively). Overall, no clear relationship between the number of invertebrate species and depth was apparent, however there was some indication that the number of species appears to be more variable in deeper waters. Several species occurred in very large numbers; these were the echinoderms, Cidaris cidaris, Benthegone rosea and Stichopus tremulus and the bivalve, Pseudammusium septemradii. Fisheries data revealed distinct deepwater fish communities that changed with depth {{and to a lesser extent}} with area. The number of species increased with depth at all sites to reach a maximum at 1500 m before decreasing again at 1800 m. At 500 m depth the fish community was mainly composed of rabbit fish and rattails with some shelf species present such as hake, ling and silver pout. The 1000 m depth strata presented a transition of species composition. The most abundant species overall was Roundnose grenadier which had is highest abundance at 1500 m in all three areas but could also be found in the 1000 and 18000 m depth strata. Other species of high abundance which also had their highest number of individuals at 1500 m were Baird’s smoothhead and other species of grenadiers. Cluster analysis revealed that Roundnose grenadier was a distinct species grouping as was that of Baird’s smoothhead. Species occurrences were similar in all three areas with some regional differences; in area 2, <b>Phycis</b> <b>blennoides,</b> greater forkbeard,occurred among the ten most abundant species while in area 5, species, such as Black Scabbard, Aphanopus carbo, and cut throat eel, Synaphobranchus kaupi, were being caught here in larger numbers while present in the other areas in low numbers. Seven comparative tows were carried out with the Scottish research vessels RV Scotia and indicated that overall similar numbers of species and total number of fish were caught. Size distribution also compared well between the two different vessels, however for some species the numbers or size ranges of fish caught differed.
