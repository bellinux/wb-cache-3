40|$|Improved glycemic {{control with}} insulin pump therapy in {{patients}} with type 1 diabetes mellitus has shown gradual reductions in nephropathy and retinopathy. More recently, the emerging concept of the artificial pancreas, comprising an insulin pump coupled to a continuous glucose meter and a control algorithm, would become the next major breakthrough in diabetes care. The patient safety and {{the efficiency of the}} therapy are directly derived from the delivery accuracy of rapid-acting insulin. For this purpose, a specific precision-oriented design of micropump has been built. The device, made of a stack of three silicon wafers, comprises two check valves and a pumping membrane that is actuated against stop limiters by a piezo actuator. Two membranes comprising piezoresistive strain gauges have been implemented to measure the pressure in the pumping chamber and at the outlet of the pump. Their high sensitivity makes possible the monitoring of the pumping accuracy with a tolerance of ± 5 % for each individual stroke of 200 nL. The capability of these sensors to monitor <b>priming,</b> <b>reservoir</b> overpressure, reservoir emptying, outlet occlusion and valve leakage has also been studied...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesPediatric {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass {{involves the}} creation of a large obligatory <b>priming</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Packed red blood cells are {{an essential part of the}} cardiopulmonary bypass priming solution in children. The storage media in packed red blood cells might cause significant acid-base, glucose, and electrolyte imbalances, which have been associated with severe complications. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the metabolic effects of fresh (≤ 5 days) versus old (> 5 days) stored packed red blood cells added to the priming solutions of pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. MethodsBlood samples were drawn from cardiopulmonary bypass priming of 30 consecutive pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Fresh (≤ 5 days old) stored packed red blood cells were added to the priming solution in group 1, and old (> 5 days old) stored packed red blood cells were added to the priming solution in group 2. In each group blood samples were drawn from the packed red blood cells on arrival to the operating room and from the priming solution immediately after packed red blood cells were added and after 20 minutes of prime circulation. Samples were also collected at the beginning of cardiopulmonary bypass and after 30 minutes. The last sample was collected on arrival to the pediatric intensive care unit. The levels of potassium, glucose, and lactate and the acid-base balance were analyzed in each sample. ResultsThere was a linear increase in potassium levels in packed red blood cell samples with increasing packed red blood cell age, ranging from 5. 4 to 18. 4 mEq/L. Significant differences in the concentrations of potassium, glucose, and lactate and the acid-base balance were found when comparing old and fresh packed red blood cells in samples taken during the packed red blood cell and early prime time. Those differences resolved after 20 minutes of reconstitution of the priming solution. The age of the packed red blood cells had no effect on the samples taken during bypass and those taken in the pediatric intensive care unit. ConclusionThe significantly higher concentration of potassium and lactate and lower pH in old stored packed red blood cells has a minimal effect on the final constitution of priming solution before and during cardiopulmonary bypass in children undergoing corrective cardiac surgery...|$|E
50|$|West Nile {{virus is}} an {{arbovirus}} of the Flavivirus {{kind in the}} family Flaviviridae. The main way it is spread is by various species of mosquitoes, with birds being the most commonly infected animal and serving as the <b>prime</b> <b>reservoir</b> host. WNV {{has been found in}} various species of ticks, but current research suggests they are not important vectors of the virus. WNV also infects various mammal species, including humans, and has been identified in reptilian species, including alligators and crocodiles, and also in amphibians. Not all animal species that are susceptible to WNV infection, including humans, and not all bird species develop sufficient viral levels to transmit the disease to uninfected mosquitoes, and are thus not considered major factors in WNV transmission.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIdentifying {{environmental}} {{sources of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) related to hospital-acquired infections represents a key challenge for public health. Biofilms in water systems offer protection and favorable growth conditions, and are <b>prime</b> <b>reservoirs</b> of microorganisms. A comparative genotyping survey assessing {{the relationship between}} Pa strains recovered in hospital sink biofilm and isolated in clinical specimens was conducted. Environmental strains from drain, faucet and sink-surface biofilm were recovered by a culture method after an incubation time ranging from 48 to 240 h. The genotyping of 38 environmental and 32 clinical isolates was performed using a multiple-locus variable-number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA). More than one-third of Pa isolates were only cultivable following ≥ 48 h of incubation, and were predominantly from faucet and sink-surface biofilms. In total, 41 / 70 strains were grouped within eight genotypes (A to H). Genotype B grouped a clinical and an environmental strain isolated in the same ward, 5 months apart, suggesting this genotype could thrive in both contexts. Genotype E grouped environmental isolates that were highly prevalent throughout the hospital and that required a longer incubation time. The results from the multi-hospital follow-up study support the drain as an important reservoir of Pa dissemination to faucets, sink surfaces and patients. Optimizing the recovery of environmental strains will strengthen epidemiological investigations, facilitate pathway identification, and assist in identifying and controlling the reservoirs potentially associated to hospital-acquired infections...|$|R
40|$|Listeriosis is {{a disease}} that causes septicemia or {{encephalitis}} in humans, animals and birds. Although, the disease is rare and sporadic in poultry but if occurs then causes septicemia or sometimes localized encephalitis. Occasionally, the disease is seen in young chicks and the causative agent, like in humans and animals, is Listeria monocytogenes. The organism is capable to infect almost all animals and poultry; however, outbreaks of listeriosis are infrequent in birds. It is widely distributed among avian species and chickens, turkeys, waterfowl (geese, ducks), game birds, pigeons, parrots, wood grouse, snowy owl, eagle, canaries, which {{appear to be the}} most commonly affected. Chickens are thought to be the carriers of Listeria and also the <b>prime</b> <b>reservoirs</b> for the infection and thus contaminate the litter and environment of the poultry production units. Listeriosis is often noticed along with other poultry diseases such as coccidiosis, infectious coryza, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis and parasitic infections, signifying the opportunistic nature of the organism. Intestinal colonization of poultry and the presence of L. monocytogenes in feces represent a potential source of the organism for listeriosis in ruminants. Man gets infection from raw broiler meat due to Listeria contamination and unhygienic conditions of the processing area, rather than acquiring direct infection from birds. With the changing food habits of the people, the health consciousness is also increasing and since listeriosis has now been recognized as an emerging food borne zoonoses. Therefore, this review has been compiled to make aware the poultry producers and the consumers of poultry meat/products regarding the importance of the disease and its public health significance...|$|R

40|$|Persistent (not intermittent) nasal {{carriage}} ofStaphylococcus aureus is the {{determinant of}} CPD-related infections. BackgroundWe investigated {{the impact of}} staphylococcal carriage among patients on continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD) in a university hospital. MethodsPatients were screened forStaphylococcus aureus carriage and categorized as persistent, intermittent, or non–S. aureus nasal carriers. Patients were subsequently recultured every 12 weeks forS. aureus and coagulase negative staphylococcal (CoNS) carriage, and followed-up for CPD-related infections and antibiotic resistance. ResultsFifty-two patients were included: 20 peristent, 10 intermittent, and 22 non–S. aureus carriers. Only persistentS. aureus carriage {{was significantly associated with}} an increased risk for all CPD-related infections [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 3. 52 (95 % CI: 2. 56 – 4. 85) ], exit site infections [IRR 5. 59 (95 % CI: 3. 50 – 8. 92) ], and peritonitis [IRR 2. 19 (95 % CI: 1. 39 – 3. 45) ], as well as increased antibiotic use [IRR 3. 43 (95 % CI: 2. 50 – 4. 72) ], including vancomycin [IRR 2. 15 (95 %: 2. 13 – 2. 16) ]. No vancomycin-resistantS. aureus strains were detected. However, eight (2 %) out of 407 CoNS strains isolated were vancomycin intermediately susceptible. In all five patients (four persistent and one intermittent carriers) concerned, this was significantly related to a higher antibiotic (including vancomycin) usage [IRR 2. 65 (95 % CI: 1. 82 – 3. 84) ]. ConclusionPersistent—but not intermittent—S. aureus nasal carriage is the major determinant of CPD-related infections, and is associated with a significantly higher consumption of antibiotics, including vancomycin. The highly diverse population of CoNS appears to be the <b>prime</b> <b>reservoir</b> of staphylococcal vancomycin resistance. Accurate determination of theS. aureus nasal carriage state of CPD patients is essential to better target intervention strategies to prevent CPD-related infections...|$|R
40|$|Carbonate mounds are {{prominent}} features throughout the geological record. In many hydrocarbon provinces, they form <b>prime</b> <b>reservoir</b> structures. But recent investigations have increasingly reported occurrences of large mound clusters {{at the surface}} of the seabed, or buried at shallow depth on modern ocean margins, and in particular in basins rich in hydrocarbons. Such exciting new observations along the West-European margin are promising for elucidating the setting and environment of modern carbonate mounds, {{but at the same time}} they confront us with puzzling or sometimes contradictory observations in the quest for their genesis. Spectacular cold-water coral communities have colonized such mounds, but convincing arguments for recognizing them as prime builders are still lacking. The geological record provides ample evidence of microbial mediation in mound build-up and stabilisation, but as long as mound drilling is lacking, we have no opportunity to verify the role of such processes and identify the key actors in the earliest stage of onset and development of modern mounds. Some evidence from the past record and from present very-high resolution observations in the shallow seabed suggest an initial control by fluid venting, and fluid migration pathways have been imaged or are tentatively reconstructed by modelling in the concerned basins, but the ultimate link in the shallow subsurface seems still to elude a large part of our efforts. Surface sampling and analyses of both corals and surface sediments have largely failed in giving any conclusive evidence of present-day or recent venting in the considered basins. But on the other hand, applying rigourously the interpretational keys derived from e. g. Porcupine Seabight settings off NW Ireland on brand new prospective settings e. g. on the Moroccan margin have resulted in the discovery of totally new mound settings, in the middle of a field of giant, active mud volcanoes. Keys are apparently working, but we still do not understand how or why. We are no doubt facing complex systems at the interface between the Biosphere and the Geosphere, owing their genesis and spectacular growth to a complex woven of internal and external controls, feedback and process relay processes...|$|R
5000|$|A {{detachment}} {{province of}} Oligocene-Miocene age is located both onshore {{and within the}} offshore continental shelf. Primarily made up of listric down-to-the-basin growth faults, the system is overlain by up to five kilometers of deltaic sediments. [...] Subsidence of these sediments is often due to simple gravitational failure or deeper extensional faulting associated with salt withdrawal. The abundance of sandstone in the area makes Louisiana a <b>prime</b> petroleum <b>reservoir.</b> However, the orientation of faults to maximum stress influences how well a seal develops in order to trap petroleum. Because it is very impermeable, salt deflects any vertical petroleum migration that attempts to cut across the salt. [...] Thick salt formation is also known {{to slow down the}} maturation of the trapped petroleum underneath. Most of the oil in the Gulf of Mexico was generated in the Late Miocene-Late Pliocene in a period called peak oil generation during which many zones of petroleum formed below the base of the salt bodies. The Late Oligocene-Miocene witnessed the shifting of the area of maximum sedimentation toward the Mississippi River delta.|$|R
40|$|West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne {{zoonotic}} arbovirus {{belonging to}} the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. This flavivirus is found in temperate and tropical regions of the world. WNV has spread globally, with the first case in the Western Hemisphere being identified in New York City in 1999; over the next 5 years, the virus spread across the continental United States, north into Canada, and southward into the Caribbean Islands and Latin America. WNV is now {{considered to be an}} endemic pathogen in Africa, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, Europe and in the United States, which in 2012 has experienced one of its worst epidemics, when WNV was killing 286 people in Texas. Phylogenetic studies have identiﬁed 2 main lineages of WNV strains. In the early 2000 -s strains from lineage 1 were present in Africa, India, and Australia and were reponsible for outbreaks in Europe, in the Mediterranean Basin, and in North America, whereas lineage 2 strains had been reported only in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. The Hungarian equine WNV outbreak reported in 2008 was the ﬁrst to be caused by a lineage 2 sub-Saharan strain in Europe. The pathogenicity of this lineage 2 strain resembled that of lineage 1 strains, and its sudden spread was unpredictable. The main mode of WNV transmission is via various species of mosquitoes which are the prime vector, with birds being the most commonly infected animal and serving as the <b>prime</b> <b>reservoir</b> host. Birds develop sufficient viral levels after being infected, to transmit the infection to other biting mosquitoes which in turn go on to infect other birds. In some species of birds, the infection is fatal. When the mosquitoes become less selective, -during late summer and early autumn, when migrating birds leave their previous living area-, begin feeding more readily on other animal types such as humans and horses which are considered incidental hosts. In mammals, the virus does not multiply as readily (i. e. does not develop high viremia during infection), and mosquitoes biting infected mammals are not believed to ingest sufficient virus to become infected, making mammals like humans and equines, so-called dead-end hosts. In our climatic area (Middle Europe) equine outbreaks of the disease occur according to strict seasonality between August and October. Approximately 80...|$|R
40|$|Research project (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of GeologyThe Upper Pennsylvanian (uppermost Missourian) Lansing-Kansas City Groups (LKC) are <b>prime</b> oil <b>reservoirs</b> {{targeted}} by many petroleum companies exploring in Kansas and Nebraska. The LKC groups are {{a series of}} cyclothems with carbonate and terrigenous clastic components. A 240 foot, full-diameter core from within Dopita Field in Rooks County, Kansas that recovered the entire LKC section, along with thin sections and plugs (porosity and permeability tested), were studied to determine the depositional facies and diagenetic controls on reservoir development in these rocks, and to understand which producing zones in the study area, if any would be candidates for a waterflood. The LKC section in the core (zones labeled A-L from top to bottom) was divided into lowstand-transgressive-highstand complete cycles and incomplete sub-cycles. A complete cycle consists of, from base to top: (i) a section with evidence of subaerial exposure,(ii) a transgressive-systems tract and ensuing maximum flooding surface, (iii) a regressive highstand-systems tract, and (iv) another section suggestive of subaerial exposure. An incomplete sub-cycle is represented by the upward change from transgression to highstand without evidence of subaerial exposure. Throughout the core, there were 6 complete cycles and 10 incomplete sub-cycles identified. The study showed that any porosity and permeability (along with oil shows) present in the rocks had developed during times of subaerial exposure within shallow-water carbonate sands deposited in the highstand systems tracts of cycles. Currently, plans are being made to begin waterflooding {{the south end of the}} Dopita Field. The results from this study are being implemented in deciding which zones to flood...|$|R
40|$|More often clay matrix is {{the major}} factor to reduce the {{porosity}} and permeability in sandstone facies. Consequently determination of clay minerals is of <b>prime</b> importance in <b>reservoir</b> quality assessment. The present study aims to identify four different types of clay mineral namely kaolinite, illite/cholorite, halloysite, and montmorilonite from Petrophysical Logs (PLs) using Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) parameter. In this regard, PLs related to two wells of Shurijeh Formation (Early cretaceous) in Gonbadly gas field, Northeast of Iran, were used. Utilizing measured CEC data and proper PLs, the CEC log were generated by employing MLP neural network. Relying on this fact that clay minerals can be classified based on their CEC value, the formation under study were divided into five zones by implementing four cut offs on CEC log. Finally, Bayesian classifier was applied on PLs to identify the desired zones. According to the obtained results, the method proposed {{in this study is}} able to identify desired clay types with average accuracy of 68. 5 % in single well analysis step and 65. 75 % for generalization step...|$|R
40|$|For {{magnetic}}ally driven events, the magnetic {{energy of the}} system is the <b>prime</b> energy <b>reservoir</b> that fuels the dynamical evolution. In the solar context, the free energy {{is one of the main}} indicators used in space weather forecasts to predict the eruptivity of active regions. A trustworthy estimation of the magnetic energy is therefore needed in three-dimensional models of the solar atmosphere, eg in coronal fields reconstructions or numerical simulations. The expression of the energy of a system as the sum of its potential energy and its free energy (Thomson's theorem) is strictly valid when the magnetic field is exactly solenoidal. For numerical realizations on a discrete grid, this property may be only approximately fulfilled. We show that the imperfect solenoidality induces terms in the energy that can lead to misinterpreting the amount of free energy present in a magnetic configuration. We consider a decomposition of the energy in solenoidal and nonsolenoidal parts which allows the unambiguous estimation of the nonsolenoidal contribution to the energy. We apply this decomposition to six typical cases broadly used in solar physics. We quantify to what extent the Thomson theorem is not satisfied when approximately solenoidal fields are used. The quantified errors on energy vary from negligible to significant errors, depending on the extent of the nonsolenoidal component. We identify the main source of errors and analyze the implications of adding a variable amount of divergence to various solenoidal fields. Finally, we present pathological unphysical situations where the estimated free energy would appear to be negative, as found in some previous works, and we identify the source of this error to be the presence of a finite divergence. We provide a method of quantifying the effect of a finite divergence in numerical fields, together with detailed diagnostics of its sources...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} to image {{reservoir}} quality of the ‘Alka discovery located in the southern part of the Hammerfest Basin, Norwegian Barents Sea. A total of five exploration wells (7120 / 12 - 1, 7120 / 12 - 2, 7120 / 12 - 3, 7120 / 12 - 4 and 7120 / 12 - 5) drilled in the study area of which four of them (7120 / 12 - 1, 7120 / 12 - 2, 7120 / 12 - 3, 7120 / 12 - 5) are located in the Hammerfest Basin, while the other one (7120 / 12 - 4) is located in the Finnmark Platform. The main reservoir unit is the Stø Formation of Middle Jurassic sandstones while U. Jurassic Hekkingen Formation acts as the main source rock for hydrocarbons. Four other potential reservoirs (Nordmela, Tubåen, Fruholmen and Snadd) are also present in the study area of Middle-Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic age. An integrated approach is used to investigate the reservoir quality of the five reservoirs of Kapp Toscana Group though the main emphasis is given to the Middle Jurassic Stø Formation; the <b>prime</b> <b>reservoir</b> in the Norwegian Barents Sea. Petrophysical analyses, rock physical diagnostics and AVO modeling are utilized to investigate the reservoir quality using data from the five exploration wells. The Stø Formation shows good reservoir quality because of high net-to-gross ratio and less amount of shale present in the formation. However, the quality of the reservoir varies with depth and location of the wells. The thin interbedded shales present within the Stø Formation reduce the quality of the reservoir sandstone at certain places. Petrophysical analyses indicate that the existence of gas saturated zones in the Stø Formation are present in the wells 7120 / 12 - 2 and 7120 / 12 - 3. The reservoir intervals consist of clean, fine to medium grained and well sorted sandstones. Nordmela, Tubåen and Fruholmen Formations have moderate reservoir quality due to a higher amount of shale content and intermediate value of net-to-gross ratio. The Snadd Formation has poor reservoir quality as depicted by low net-to-gross ratio, high percentage of shale and poor sorting. A series of rock physics diagnostics have been employed to study the porosity, clay content, cementation and fluid saturation of the five reservoir horizons of Kapp Toscana Group. The crossplot of porosity versus Vp shows that the Stø Formation in the wells 7120 / 12 - 5 and 7120 / 12 - 1 is more cemented as compared to the other two wells 7120 / 12 - 2 and 7120 / 12 - 3. In the wells 7120 / 12 - 2 and 7120 / 12 - 3 the gas saturated zones can be identified by low Vp in the porosity versus Vp cross plot. Although the cross plot of AI versus Vp/Vs is an excellent indicator to discriminate fluid types but the gas saturated zones identified earlier fall on the water saturated line in AI versus Vp/Vs cross plot. However, the cross plot of Lamda-Rho and Mu-Rho clearly shows that these gas saturated zones have lower values of Lambda-Rho (incompressibility) and Mu-Rho (rigidity). AVO modeling indicates that change in rock properties are more pronounced by introducing 10 % gas saturation than at higher percentages of gas. The top of the Stø Formation exhibits the Class IV gas sand and the zero offset reflection coefficient increases with increase in gas saturation. The outcomes of the study is to enhanced understanding of quality of the reservoir rocks by integrating cross disciplinary techniques including petrophysical analyses, rock physics diagnostics and AVO modeling which may not be that developed at the time when the Alka discovery was discovered. As the study area has experienced several phases of uplift and erosion which may have consequence on reservoir quality, maturity of source rock and reservoir pressure, thus compaction study and exhumation estimation are necessary to understand better the associated uncertainties and to reduce the risk for further exploration and development in the study area...|$|R
