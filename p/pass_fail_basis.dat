40|$|Novel test chip {{structures}} isolating process {{problems in}} certain device regions were designed in area ratios of lx, 4 x, and 16 x {{in order to}} investigate sizing trends. The upper three levels of an NMOS process (poly, dielectric, and metal) were fabricated. Metal line integrity structures were tested on a <b>pass</b> or <b>fail</b> <b>basis.</b> Results show that problems did occur in the metal patterning steps causing shorts between adjacent lines.

50|$|The {{student is}} graded on a <b>pass</b> and <b>fail</b> <b>basis</b> with the {{potential}} to earn three credits. The Field Period can be completed over summer break or winter break, as students have the month of January off. Students design a learning contract with the site of their choice that outlines learning goals and objectives that must be met. Each student's site supervisor evaluates the student's work ethic and progress and reports back to Keuka College's Experiential Learning office. Upon completion, students meet with their academic advisors to present unique documentation of the experience and hand in a recap paper and reflective journal.|$|R
