Having fled to the Portuguese capital via Spain, Rezala made {{a phone call to}} his girlfriend from a <b>public</b> <b>call</b> <b>box</b> – unaware that investigators in France had tapped her phone. On January 11, 2000, Rezala's hiding place was snuffed out by Portuguese police, who arrested the man in Barreiro, south of Lisbon. He had been staying in Almada with friends of a Spanish acquaintance and was planning to leave within 24 hours for Spain's Canary Islands.|$|E

5000|$|In the Doctor Who TV series, Time Lords {{are capable}} of {{engineering}} objects bigger on the inside than out, known as cross-dimensional engineering. The primary example is that the Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS, has the outward size and appearance of a police <b>public</b> <b>call</b> <b>box,</b> but whose doors open into a much larger central control room. Other doors branch off from the main room to off-screen areas; the TARDIS is implied {{to be at least}} {{the size of a large}} mansion, containing multiple tennis courts and swimming pools, and is apparently of theoretically infinite size, capable of generating more rooms as needed. On a simpler level, Time Lords have been known to make actual [...] "pocket dimensions" [...] - pockets that are bigger on the inside.|$|E
50|$|The Police {{discovered}} that the telephone call had been made from a <b>public</b> <b>call</b> <b>box</b> only 400 yards from Wallace's home, and hypothesised that Wallace had made the call himself to create an elaborate alibi, and had in fact murdered his wife before leaving his house the following evening. However, no trace of blood was found on Wallace, although the killer would have been heavily bloodstained, and a milk-boy's testimony of seeing Mrs. Wallace alive sometime between 6.30pm and 6.45pm left Wallace scarcely enough time to kill his wife, clean himself up, and stage a robbery before catching his tram. The murder-weapon was not found, and no motive could be ascribed to Wallace in killing his wife. On the contrary, Wallace, 52, was in poor health, {{and his wife had}} fulfilled the role of companion and sometime nurse. They had been married 17 years and had no children.|$|E
50|$|Donald {{abruptly}} wakes {{from his}} sporadic nap and takes immediate action {{to prevent a}} fire emergency. He takes Huey, Dewey and Louie's crayon plan and sticks {{it up on the}} wall. He puts in a collapsible ladder in his room, makes sure the windows throughout the house open easily from the inside and the screens are easily removed, and adds a ladder to his garage for others to use from the outside. He gathers his nephews to tell them what the plan is {{in the event of an}} emergency, stressing that they should remain calm and never hide under the bed or in the closet as that can be a fatal mistake. Donald then initiates a fire drill where we see how the nephews escape their room through their window and down the ladder he placed outside. The instructions end with Donald and the boys going to a <b>public</b> fire department <b>call</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
