40|$|Producing liquid {{transportation}} {{fuels and}} power via coal and biomass to liquids (CBTL) and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) processes can significantly improve the nation's energy security. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates increasing renewable fuels nearly 10 -fold to > 2. 3 {{million barrels per}} day by 2022. Coal is abundantly available and coal to liquids (CTL) plants can be deployed today, but they will not become sustainable without large scale CO{sub 2 } capture and storage. Co-processing of coal and biomass in CBTL processes in a 60 to 40 ratio is an attractive option that has the potential to produce 4 million barrels of transportation fuels per day by 2020 at the same level of CO{sub 2 } emission as petroleum. In this work, Southern Research Institute (Southern) has made an attempt to address one of the major barriers to the development of large scale CBTL processes - cost effective/reliable dry-feeding of coal-biomass mixtures into a high pressure vessel representative of commercial entrained-flow gasifiers. Present method for dry coal feeding involves the use of pressurized lock-hopper arrangements that are not only very expensive with large space requirements but also have not been proven for reliably feeding coal-biomass mixtures without the potential problems of segregation and bridging. The project involved the development of a pilot-scale 250 lb/h high pressure dry coal-biomass mixture feeder provided by TKEnergi and proven for feeding biomass at a scale up to 6 ton/day. The aim of this project is to demonstrate cost effective feeding of coal-biomass mixtures (50 : 50 to 70 : 30) made from a variety of coals (bituminous, lignite) and biomass (wood, corn stover, switch grass). The feeder uses a hydraulic piston-based approach to produce a series of plugs of the mixture that act as a seal against high back-pressure of the gasification vessel in to which the mixture is being fed. The plugs are then fed one by one via a plug breaker into the high <b>pressure</b> <b>gasification</b> vessel. A number of runs involving the feeding of coal and biomass mixtures containing 50 to 70 weight % coal into a high <b>pressure</b> <b>gasification</b> vessel simulator have shown that plugs of sufficient density can be formed to provide a seal against pressures up to 450 psig if homogeneity of the mixture can be maintained. However, the in-homogeneity of coal-biomass mixtures can occur during the mixing process because of density, particle size and moisture differences. Also, the much lower compressibility of coal as opposed to biomass can contribute to non-uniform plug formation which can result in weak plugs. Based on present information, the piston plug feeder offered marginal economic advantages over lock-hoppers. The results suggest a modification to the piston feeder that can potentially seal against pressure without the need for forming plugs. This modified design could result in lower power requirements and potentially better economics...|$|E

Previous work has shown that pressure has marked impacts on the volatile yield new work has shown that it also impacts particle swelling behaviour during devolatilisation and hence the resulting char structure and morphology. Char particles generated at elevated pressures have high porosity. These char particles experience more extensive fragmentation during the combustion and gasification, which leads to finer ash particles compared to that formed at low pressures. At high pressure, the char particles appear to burn faster. The char structure also determines the ash liberation for the different combustion stages.

It is {{observed that the}} particle size (for particles between 0. 8 and 3 mm) did not change the pyrolysis process results. Char gasification rates in CO 2, steam and mixture of CO 2 +steam are investigated in the same TGA system over the temperature range of 850 – 950 °C. The pyrolysis heating rate for char formation is observed to have a marked influence on the subsequent gasification reactivity of the char. The {{results indicate that the}} char produced from high heating rates show improved gasification rates. Smaller particles exhibit higher char–CO 2 and char–steam gasification rates. Increasing the temperature from 850 to 950 °C, leads to a significant reduction of the time required for 50 % char conversion both for small and large particles. The maximum reaction rate is shifted to higher conversion degrees when the chars are produced from high heating rates. The gasification rate of char–H 2 O strongly depends on the H 2 O partial <b>pressure.</b> <b>Gasification</b> rates in CO 2 ambiance are much lower than those in steam.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model for entrained flow coal gasification was developed {{with the objective}} of predicting the influence of coal properties and gasification conditions on the performance of entrained flow gasifiers operating at pressures up to 21 atmospheres (2. 1 MPa). The model represents gasifiers as plug flow reactors and therefore neglects any mixing or turbulence effects. Coal properties were predicted through use of correlations from a variety of literature sources and others that were developed from experimental data in the literature. A sensitivity analysis of the model indicated that errors in the calculated values of coal volatile yield, carbon dioxide gasification reactivity and steam gasification may significantly affect the model predictions. Similarly errors in the input values for gasifier wall temperatures and gasifier diameter, when affected by slagging, can cause model prediction errors. Model predictions were compared with experimental gasification results for a range of atmospheric and high pressure gasifiers, the majority of the results being obtained by CSIRO at atmospheric pressure for a range of coals. Predictions were accurate for the majority of atmospheric pressure results over a large range of gas feed mixtures.

40|$|In {{order to}} keep abreast of the trend in modern ammonia {{technology}} towards lower energy consumption, Kynoch Fertilizer Limited and Babcock & Wilcox have developed a new atmospheric pressure coal gasifier. The new gasifier called the Advanced Coal Gasification Process (ACGP) is intended to replace an ageing set of Koppers Totzek units at Kynoch’s plant at Modderfontein, South Africa. Atmospheric pressure operation was chosen in this instance as the change to commercial pressurised gasification had {{been found to be}} uneconomic. This paper compares the energy balance of a gas production island incorporating the ACGP with that of a typical dry feed entrained flow pressurised gasification process.

However, the waste heat recovered by the ACGP covers about 106 % of its shaft power requirements compared to about 94 % for the pressurised process. Thus the gas production island would be a net power importer if operated at elevated pressure, and a net power exporter if operated at atmospheric pressure.

40|$|Biomass {{represents}} a large potential feedstock resource for environmentally clean processes that produce power or chemicals. It {{lends itself to}} both biological and thermal conversion processes and both options are currently being explored. Hydrogen can be produced {{in a variety of}} ways. The majority of the hydrogen produced in this country is produced through natural gas reforming and is used as chemical feedstock in refinery operations. In this report we will examine the production of hydrogen by gasification of biomass. Biomass is defined as organic matter that is available on a renewable basis through natural processes or as a by-product of processes that use renewable resources. The majority of biomass is used in combustion processes, in mills that use the renewable resources, to produce electricity for end-use product generation. This report will explore the use of hydrogen as a fuel derived from gasification of three candidate biomass feedstocks: bagasse, switchgrass, and a nutshell mix that consists of 40 % almond nutshell, 40 % almond prunings, and 20 % walnut shell. In this report, an assessment of the technical and economic potential of producing hydrogen from biomass gasification is analyzed. The resource base was assessed to determine a process scale from feedstock costs and availability. Solids handling systems were researched. A GTI proprietary gasifier model was used in combination with a Hysys(reg. sign) design and simulation program to determine the amount of hydrogen that can be produced from each candidate biomass feed. Cost estimations were developed and government programs and incentives were analyzed. Finally, the barriers to the production and commercialization of hydrogen from biomass were determined. The end-use of the hydrogen produced from this system is small PEM fuel cells for automobiles. Pyrolysis of biomass was also considered. Pyrolysis is a reaction in which biomass or coal is partially vaporized by heating. Gasification is a more general term, and includes heating as well as the injection of other ''ingredients'' such as oxygen and water. Pyrolysis alone is a useful first step in creating vapors from coal or biomass that can then be processed in subsequent steps to make liquid fuels. Such products are not the objective of this project. Therefore pyrolysis {{was not included in the}} process design or in the economic analysis. High-pressure, fluidized bed gasification is best known to GTI through 30 years of experience. Entrained flow, in contrast to fluidized bed, is a gasification technology applied at much larger unit sizes than employed here. Coal gasification and residual oil gasifiers in refineries are the places where such designs have found application, at sizes on the order of 5 to 10 times larger than what has been determined for this study. Atmospheric <b>pressure</b> <b>gasification</b> is also not discussed. Atmospheric gasification has been the choice of all power system pilot plants built for biomass to date, except for the Varnamo plant in Sweden, which used the Ahlstrom (now Foster Wheeler) pressurized gasifier.

RFE was entrusted with erecting the technical-scale plant and carrying out the experiments. The crude gases of an HTW gasifier with air or oxygen/steam operation are simulated by mixing desulphurized synthetic gas from oil <b>pressure</b> <b>gasification</b> with nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Setting different hydrogen sulphide, ammonia and water contents is done by dosing and joint evaporation of suitably concentrated ammonium hydrogen sulphide solutions. There is a heated mixing chamber and a superheater identical to the evaporator after the evaporator, where the gases can be heated to a maximum of 650 C. These flow into the reactor (inside diameter 60 mm, clear height 1360 mm) from the top, via a heated transfer pipe. To measure the temperature profile, there is a pipe with a total of 12 thermocouples in the reactor longitudinal axis. Below the absorbent heap, a heated analysis pipe opens into the reactor, through which a part flow of the gas flows to the analysers after pressure relieving. The main flow of the hot gas is cooled to 180 C in a sulphur cooler after the reactor and then reaches the water cooler via the sulphur separator and the pressure control valve. The separated condensate is locked out via the water separator, while the gases either flow directly to the torch or reach a gas washer. To regenerate the absorber, a gas containing oxygen (air/nitrogen or air/steam mixture) or steam is passed through the reactor along the same route.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the technical and economic performance of thermal processes to generate electricity from a wood chip feedstock by combustion, gasification and fast pyrolysis. The scope of the work begins with the delivery of a wood chip feedstock at a conversion plant and ends with the supply of electricity to the grid, incorporating wood chip preparation, thermal conversion, and electricity generation in dual fuel diesel engines. Net generating capacities of 1 – 20 MWe are evaluated. The techno-economic assessment is achieved through the development of a suite of models that are combined to give cost and performance data for the integrated system. The models include feed pretreatment, combustion, atmospheric and <b>pressure</b> <b>gasification,</b> fast pyrolysis with pyrolysis liquid storage and transport (an optional step in de-coupled systems) and diesel engine or turbine power generation. The models calculate system efficiencies, capital costs and production costs. An identical methodology is applied in the development of all the models so that all of the results are directly comparable. The electricity production costs have been calculated for 10 th plant systems, indicating the costs that are achievable in the medium term after the high initial costs associated with novel technologies have reduced. The costs converge at the larger scale with the mean electricity price paid in the EU by a large consumer, and there is therefore potential for fast pyrolysis and diesel engine systems to sell electricity directly to large consumers or for on-site generation. However, competition will be fierce at all capacities since electricity production costs vary only slightly between the four biomass to electricity systems that are evaluated. Systems de-coupling is one way that the fast pyrolysis and diesel engine system can distinguish itself from the other conversion technologies. Evaluations in this work show that situations requiring several remote generators are much better served by a large fast pyrolysis plant that supplies fuel to de-coupled diesel engines than by constructing an entire close-coupled system at each generating site. Another advantage of de-coupling is that the fast pyrolysis conversion step and the diesel engine generation step can operate independently, with intermediate storage of the fast pyrolysis liquid fuel, increasing overall reliability. Peak load or seasonal power requirements would also benefit from de-coupling since a small fast pyrolysis plant could operate continuously to produce fuel that is stored for use in the engine on demand. Current electricity production costs for a fast pyrolysis and diesel engine system are 0. 091 /kWh at 1 MWe when learning effects are included. These systems are handicapped by the typical characteristics of a novel technology: high capital cost, high labour, and low reliability. As such the more established combustion and steam cycle produces lower cost electricity under current conditions. The fast pyrolysis and diesel engine system is a low capital cost option but it also suffers from relatively low system efficiency particularly at high capacities. This low efficiency {{is the result of a}} low conversion efficiency of feed energy into the pyrolysis liquid, because of the energy in the char by-product. A sensitivity analysis has highlighted the high impact on electricity production costs of the fast pyrolysis liquids yield. The liquids yield should be set realistically during design, and it should be maintained in practice by careful attention to plant operation and feed quality. Another problem is the high power consumption during feedstock grinding. Efficiencies may be enhanced in ablative fast pyrolysis which can tolerate a chipped feedstock. This has yet to be demonstrated at commercial scale. In summary, the fast pyrolysis and diesel engine system has great potential to generate electricity at a profit in the long term, and at a lower cost than any other biomass to electricity system at small scale. This future viability can only be achieved through the construction of early plant that could, in the short term, be more expensive than the combustion alternative. Profitability in the short term can best be achieved by exploiting niches in the market place and specific features of fast pyrolysis. These include: •countries or regions with fiscal incentives for renewable energy such as premium electricity prices or capital grants; •locations with high electricity prices so that electricity can be sold direct to large consumers or generated on-site by companies who wish to reduce their consumption from the grid; •waste disposal opportunities where feedstocks can attract a gate fee rather than incur a cost; •the ability to store fast pyrolysis liquids as a buffer against shutdowns or as a fuel for peak-load generating plant; •de-coupling opportunities where a large, single pyrolysis plant supplies fuel to several small and remote generators; •small-scale combined heat and power opportunities; •sales of the excess char, although a market has yet to be established for this by-product; and •potential co-production of speciality chemicals and fuel for power generation in fast pyrolysis systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{release of}} sulfur during {{gasification}} and pyrolysis of black liquor {{in the presence}} of sodium titanates was investigated using a pressurized, entrained-flow reactor. The reaction conditions were temperatures of 900 °C, 950 °C and 1000 °C, at pressures of 0. 5 MPa and 1 MPa and in atmospheres of pure N 2 or N 2 with 2 % CO 2. Conversion of up to 35 % of the sulfur in black liquor to gases was obtained within 5 seconds at these conditions. More of the sulfur in black liquor was converted to gases when CO 2 was present than when not. More of both H 2 S and COS were produced {{in the presence of}} CO 2 than in pure N 2.

40|$|Within {{this study}} {{energetic}} and exergetic theoretical analyses {{of a novel}} IGCC power plant concept with CO 2 capture are carried out. The core process of the concept examined {{is based on the}} high <b>pressure</b> steam <b>gasification</b> of high moisture low grade coals where CO 2 is captured reacting exothermically with CaO-based sorbents and high hydrogencontent carbon-free fuel gas is produced without using additional shift reactors and CO 2 separation stages. The carbonated sorbents are continuously fed to an oxygen blown calcination reactor where pure CO 2 is released and active CaO is reproduced. This concept can be realised in a dual fluidised bed reactor system where coal gasification and CaCO 3 calcination are taking place simultaneously. In this paper possible plant configurations are presented and detailed simulation of 400 MWe IGCC power plant based on a state of the art gas turbine cycle with a three pressure stage heat recovery steam generator is performed using the ASPEN Plus simulator. The calculated results demonstrate the capability of the power plant to deliver almost decarbonised electricity while achieving net plant efficiencies at about 38. 4 % of coal lower heating value (LHV). Based on the energy analysis and the data generated from the simulation an exergy analysis was performed in order to quantify and localize the thermodynamic irreversibility in each process component as well as to asses the overall thermodynamic imperfection of the proposed process.

The aim {{of work to}} obtained comprehensive knowledge of release alkali species Na-,K-,Cl and S- species prior to carry out experiment. Therefore thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed by Fact Sage 5. 2 and simulated the gasification environment at elevated pressure. Three soft Pakistani coal such as Lakhra (Vad < 41. 44 %), Thar (Vad < 42. 02 %) and Sor-range ((Vad < 21. 11 %) belong to Lignite and sub-bituminous coal were selected and releasing order was calculated by plotting mole fraction of each species Vs pressure (5 to 15 bar) at 1000 °C. On the basis of predicted releasing order the H 2 S can be predicted most stable species under <b>gasification</b> at elevated <b>pressure.</b> The high released amount of SO 2, H 2 S, NaCl, KCl and HCl was predicted for LKH and SRC at 5 and 15 bar pressure and 1000 °C temperature. Comparing with high pressure the predicted released of H 2 S was found higher than SO 2, NaCl, KCl and HCl at 15 bar pressure while the released of SO 2 was observed lower than H 2 S, NaCl, KCl and HCl at 5 bar <b>pressure</b> during <b>gasification</b> process.

40|$|Four coals of {{different}} rank were gasified, using a steam/oxygen mixture as gasifying agent, at atmospheric and elevated pressure in a {{fixed bed reactor}} fitted with a solids feeding system in continuous mode. Independently of coal rank, an increase in <b>gasification</b> <b>pressure</b> led to a decrease in H 2 + CO production and carbon conversion. Gasification of the different rank coals revealed that the higher the carbon content and reactivity, the greater the hydrogen production. Co-gasification experiments of binary (coal–biomass) and ternary blends (coal–petcoke–biomass) were conducted at high pressure to study possible synergetic effects. Interactions between the blend components were found to modify the gas production. An improvement in hydrogen production and cold gas efficiency was achieved when the coal was gasified with biomass.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of biomass char gasification kinetics has considerable {{importance in the}} design of advanced biomass gasifiers, some of which operate at high <b>pressure.</b> The char <b>gasification</b> kinetics themselves are influenced by char structure. In this study, the effects of pyrolysis pressure and heating rate on the char structure were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, digital cinematography, and surface area analysis. Char samples were prepared at pressures between 1 and 20 bar. temperatures ranging from 800 to 1000 degrees C, and heating rates between 20 and 500 degrees C/s. Our results indicate that pyrolysis conditions have a notable impact on the biomass char morphology. Pyrolysis pressure, in particular, was found to influence the size and the shape of char particles while high heating rates led to plastic deformation of particles (i. e. melting) resulting in smooth surfaces and large cavities. The global gasification reactivities of char samples were also determined using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) technique. Char reactivities were found to increase with increasing pyrolysis heating rates and decreasing pyrolysis pressure. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{instrumentation}} grant was to acquire a state-of-the-art, high pressure, high temperature thermogravimetric apparatus (HP/HT TGA) system {{for the study of}} the interactions between gases and carbonaceous solids for the purpose of solving problems related to coal utilization and applications of carbon materials. The instrument that we identified for this purpose was manufactured by DMT (Deutsche Montan Technologies) [...] Institute of Cokemaking and Coal Chemistry of Essen, Germany. Particular features of note include: Two reactors: a standard TGA reactor, capable of 1100 C at 100 bar; and a high temperature (HT) reactor, capable of operation at 1600 C and 100 bar; A steam generator capable of generating steam to 100 bar; Flow controllers and gas mixing system for up to three reaction gases, plus a separate circuit for steam, and another for purge gas; and An automated software system for data acquisition and control. The HP/TP DMT-TGA apparatus was purchased in 1996 and installed and commissioned during the summer of 1996. The apparatus was located in Room 128 of the Prince Engineering Building at Brown University. A hydrogen alarm and vent system were added for safety considerations. The system has been interfaced to an Ametek quadruple mass spectrometer (MA 100), pumped by a Varian V 250 turbomolecular pump, as provided for in the original proposed. With this capability, a number of gas phase species of interest can be monitored in a near-simultaneous fashion. The MS can be used in a few different modes. During high <b>pressure,</b> steady-state <b>gasification</b> experiments, it is used to sample, measure, and monitor the reactant/product gases.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an exergy analysis of SNG production via indirect gasification of various biomass feedstock, including virgin (woody) biomass {{as well as}} waste biomass (municipal solid waste and sludge). In indirect gasification heat needed for endothermic gasification reactions is produced by burning char in a separate combustion section of the gasifier and subsequently the heat is transferred to the gasification section. The advantages of indirect gasification are no syngas dilution with nitrogen and no external heat source required. The production process involves several process units, including biomass gasification, syngas cooler, cleaning and compression, methanation reactors and SNG conditioning. The process is simulated with a computer model using the flow-sheeting program Aspen Plus. The exergy analysis is performed for various operating conditions such as gasifier pressure, methanation pressure and temperature. The largest internal exergy losses occur in the gasifier followed by methanation and SNG conditioning. It is shown that exergetic efficiency of biomass-to-SNG process for woody biomass is higher than that for waste biomass. The exergetic efficiency for all biomass feedstock increases with <b>gasification</b> <b>pressure,</b> whereas the effects of methanation pressure and temperature are opposite for treated wood and waste biomas...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} and chemical structure as well as gasification reactivities of chars generated from several biomass species (i. e. pinus radiata, eucalyptus maculata and sugar cane bagasse) were studied to gain insight {{into the role of}} heating rate and <b>pressure</b> on the <b>gasification</b> characteristics of biomass chars. Char samples were generated in a suite of reactors including a wire mesh reactor, a tubular reactor, and a drop tube furnace. Scanning electron microscopy analysis, X-ray diffractometry, digital cinematography and surface area analysis were employed to determine the impact of operating conditions on the char structure. The global gasification reactivities of char samples were also determined for a range of pressures between 1 and 20 bar using pressurised thermogravimetric analysis technique. Char reactivities were found to increase with increasing pyrolysis heating rates and decreasing pyrolysis pressure. It was found that under high heating rates the char particles underwent plastic deformation (i. e. melted) developing a structure different to that of the virgin biomass. Pressure was also found to influence the {{physical and}} chemical structures of char particles. The difference in the gasification reactivities of biomass chars at pressure was found to correlate well with the effect of pyrolysis pressure on the graphitisation process in the biomass char structure...|$|R
