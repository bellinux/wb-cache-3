50|$|The <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> is {{most likely}} from a cross between key lime (Citrus aurantiifolia) and lemon (Citrus × limon).|$|E
50|$|It is a {{different}} fruit from the Palestinian sweet lime and from familiar sour limes such as the Key lime and the <b>Persian</b> <b>lime.</b>|$|E
50|$|Citrus × latifolia, {{with common}} names {{seedless}} lime, Bearss lime, <b>Persian</b> <b>lime,</b> and Tahiti lime, is a citrus fruit species of hybrid origin, known only in cultivation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Persian</b> <b>limes</b> {{are larger}} and contain more juice than Mexican limes. It is an acid lime {{which has been}} {{developed}} in recent times. Its origin is inferred as a hybrid of the Mexican lime and citron.|$|R
50|$|Citrus trees hybridise very readily - {{depending}} on the pollen source, plants grown from a <b>Persian</b> <b>lime's</b> seeds can produce fruit similar to grapefruit. Thus all commercial citrus cultivation uses trees produced by grafting the desired fruiting cultivars onto rootstocks selected for disease resistance and hardiness.|$|R
50|$|The biggest {{focus of}} Mexican citrus {{production}} is on key limes; in 2003, Mexico produced 768,000 tonnes of key limes and 235,000 tonnes of <b>Persian</b> <b>limes.</b> For the 2010/11 season, Mexico forecasts {{that it will}} produce a total of 1.9 million tonnes of limes. The largest importers of lime oil are the US, UK, Japan, Ireland and Belgium.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> (Citrus × latifolia), with cultivars {{including}} the Tahiti and Bearss limes. This {{is the single}} most widely produced lime globally, with Mexico being the largest producer.|$|E
50|$|The {{trees are}} {{propagated}} clonally, by grafting or air layering. Persian limes are commercialized primarily in six sizes, known as 110's, 150's, 175's, 200's, 230's and 250's. Once grown primarily in Florida in the U.S, it rose to prominence after key lime orchards {{were wiped out}} there by a hurricane in 1926, according to the American Pomological Society; subsequently <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> orchards themselves were devastated by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Large numbers of Persian limes are grown, processed, and exported every year primarily from Mexico to the American, European and Asian markets. U.S. <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> imports from Mexico are handled mostly through McAllen, Texas.|$|E
5000|$|The two popular {{varieties}} of limes grown in Mexico are the Mexican or Key lime (Citrus aurantifolia) and the <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> (Citrus latifolia, simply called [...] "lime" [...] in the US); {{the former is}} of Indo-Malayan origin introduced in Mexico by the Spaniards after the 1520s, while the latter, also called the Tahiti lime, was introduced from US. <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> production in Mexico caters specifically to the US market; {{a substantial increase in}} production has been attributed to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Lime production in Mexico has also expanded consequent to the increase in its per capita consumption in the United States and the European Union (EU).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Persian</b> sweet <b>lime,</b> {{also known}} as the limetta, is small and round like a common lime, with sweet juice.|$|R
50|$|The {{zest and}} {{mesocarp}} {{vary with the}} genetics of the fruit. Fruit with peels that are almost all flavedo are generally mandarines; relatives of pummelos and citrons tend to have thicker mesocarp. The mesocarp of pummelo relatives (grapefruit, orange, etc.) is generally more bitter; the mesocarp of citron relatives (Mexican and <b>Persian</b> <b>limes,</b> alemows etc.) is milder. The lemon is a hybrid of pummelo, citron, and mandarin. The mesocarp is also edible, and is used to make succade.|$|R
50|$|Most limes {{are grown}} in the warmer {{southwest}} (60% of total) and southeast of the country (40%). Key limes amount to about 54% of the total lime production, and are {{grown in the}} southwestern states of Jalisco, Colima, Michoacán, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. <b>Persian</b> <b>limes,</b> about 42% of the lime production, are grown in Jalisco, Colima, Hidalgo, in micro-climates in northern Veracruz, and in the southeastern states of Tlaxcala, Chiapas, Tabasco and the Yucatan. The most important lime producing states are Michoacán and Colima.|$|R
50|$|In {{some places}} of Mexico {{and the world}} it is {{difficult}} to find the lime from Yucatan, so it can be substituted with Florida common lime or <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> without any substantial changes in the final flavor.|$|E
50|$|This {{mixture is}} cooked with kidney beans or yellow split-peas, yellow or red onions, black lime (pierced dried limu-Omani <b>Persian</b> <b>lime),</b> and turmeric-seasoned lamb or beef. The dish is then served with chelow (Persian {{parboiled}} and steamed rice) or over tahdig.|$|E
50|$|Freshly {{squeezed}} {{lime juice}} {{is the key}} ingredient. The most common lime in the United States is the thick-skinned <b>Persian</b> <b>lime.</b> However, margaritas in Mexico are generally made with Mexican limes (Key limes). These are small, thin-skinned limes and have more tart and an often bitter flavor compared to Persian limes.|$|E
50|$|Key lime pie is an American dessert made of Key lime juice, egg yolks, and {{sweetened}} {{condensed milk}} in a pie crust. The traditional Conch version uses the egg whites to make a meringue topping. The dish is named after the small Key limes (Citrus aurantifolia 'Swingle') that are naturalized throughout the Florida Keys. While their thorns make them less tractable, and their thin, yellow rinds more perishable, Key limes are more tart and more aromatic than the common <b>Persian</b> <b>limes</b> seen year-round at grocery stores in the United States.|$|R
50|$|When {{human skin}} {{is exposed to}} {{ultraviolet}} light after contact with lime peel or juice, a reaction known as phytophotodermatitis can occur, which can cause darkening of the skin, swelling or blistering. Bartenders handling limes and other citrus fruits when preparing cocktails may develop phytophotodermatitis due to the high concentration of furocoumarins and other phototoxic coumarins in limes.The main coumarin in limes is limettin which has manifold higher content in peels than in pulp. <b>Persian</b> <b>limes</b> have a higher content of coumarins and potentially greater phototoxicity than do Key limes.|$|R
5000|$|Brew By Numbers, London brews a Farmhouse Gose (18|04) using {{coriander}} {{and salt}} and Wild Beer Co, Somerset make a gose called Sleeping Lemons brewed with salt and preserved lemons. Chorlton Brewing Company in Manchester brew a limited edition [...] "imperial black gose" [...] each year called Dark Matter. The 2016 version was aged on <b>Persian</b> black <b>limes.</b> The first commercially produced Gose of notoriety in UK is Salty Kiss from Magic Rock Brew Co. in Huddersfield. It is internationally recognised, having {{won a gold medal}} at the World Beer Cup.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, the <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> {{industry}} {{has taken off}} in Veracruz, dominated by large-scale producers, with over 25% of limes being produced using micro-jet irrigation or other irrigation systems, year-round in micro-climates. Transportation costs from Veracruz to the US border are reported to be approximately 11,500 pesos (US$912.69) per trailer, depending on fuel prices.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} species of citrus trees whose fruits are called limes, {{including}} the Key lime (Citrus aurantifolia), <b>Persian</b> <b>lime,</b> kaffir lime, and desert lime. Limes are {{an excellent source of}} vitamin C, and are often used to accent the flavours of foods and beverages. They are grown year-round.Plants with fruit called [...] "limes" [...] have diverse genetic origins; limes do not form a monophyletic group.|$|E
50|$|The fruit can {{be frozen}} whole {{and used as}} ice cubes in {{beverages}} such as tea, soft drinks, water, and cocktails. The juice {{can be used in}} place of that of the common <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> (also called Bearss lime). The juice is extracted by crushing the whole fruit, and makes a flavorful drink similar to lemonade. A liqueur can be made from the whole fruits, in combination with vodka and sugar.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Persian</b> or Tahiti <b>lime</b> tree {{grows to}} 15 - 20 ft height, with broad lanceolat leaves and {{slightly}} purple-tinged flowers (with no viable pollen) mostly in January. The fruit has vivid green peel till it ripens to pale-yellow. Its pulp with 10 segments of light greenish-yellow color is normally seedless.|$|R
50|$|This {{organism}} {{is common}} and widespread, being found {{east of the}} Rocky Mountains in the United States and over much of Europe. It {{is also found in}} Australia and Asia. It commonly fruits in the spring, occasionally during autumn, and rarely during other seasons. Many mushroom hunters will stumble upon this when looking for morels during the spring as both have similar fruiting times, and this fungus can grow to a noticeable size of up to 50 cm across. It {{plays an important role in}} woodland ecosystems by decomposing wood, usually elm, but is occasionally a parasite on living trees. Other tree hosts include ash, beech, horse chestnut, <b>Persian</b> walnut, <b>lime,</b> maple, planetree, poplar, and willow.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} fruits have {{originated}} in Iran, including <b>Persian</b> walnuts, muskmelons, <b>limes,</b> and pomegranates, Apple, Apricot, Grape, Fig, Citron, and many more. The country is {{blessed with a}} variety of favorable meteorological conditions suitable for fruit production. The northern seaside lands of the Caspian Sea, and the country supplies finest conditions for citrus production. Iran ranks [...] in the world in the production of pomegranates, [...] in dates, [...] in figs, [...] in cherries, [...] in grapes, and [...] in oranges. Kiwifruit production, although a relatively new activity {{in this part of the}} world, has grown increasing importance in last few years and the Iranian kiwifruit promises to become a great export item of the agricultural sector of the country.|$|R
5000|$|The colour {{of citrus}} fruits only {{develops}} in climates with a (diurnal) cool winter. In tropical regions with no winter at all, citrus fruits remain green until maturity, hence the tropical [...] "green oranges". The <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> {{in particular is}} extremely sensitive to cool conditions, thus it is not usually exposed to cool enough conditions to develop a mature colour. If they are left in a cool place over winter, the fruits will change colour to yellow.|$|E
50|$|It {{is smaller}} and seedier, {{with a higher}} acidity, a {{stronger}} aroma, and a thinner rind, {{than that of the}} <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> (Citrus × latifolia). It is valued for its unique flavor compared to other limes. The name comes from its association with the Florida Keys, where it is best known as the flavoring ingredient in Key lime pie. It is also known as West Indian lime, bartender’s lime, Omani lime, or Mexican lime, the last classified as a distinct race with a thicker skin and darker green color. Philippine varieties have various names, including dayap and bilolo.|$|E
5000|$|Chōzaburō Tanaka (Tanaka Chōzaburō) or often Romanized as Tyôzaburô Tanaka (November 3, 1885 in Osaka - June 28, 1976) was a Japanese {{botanist}} and mycologist. He established {{one of the}} {{two major}} taxonomic classification systems for citrus and related genera currently in use, and is now considered to be a taxonomic [...] "splitter". He is the author of 180 botanical names in the citrus family Rutaceae, including for example Citrus × latifolia (<b>Persian</b> <b>lime)</b> and Citrus tangerina (tangerine). Many of the species Tanaka described are still recognized, but his overall scheme is not supported by modern genetic research.|$|E
50|$|The tree {{is nearly}} thornless. The fruit is about 6 cm in diameter, often with {{slightly}} nippled ends, {{and is usually}} sold while green, although it yellows as it reaches full ripeness. It is also widely available dried, as it is often used this way in Persian cuisine. It is larger, thicker-skinned, with less intense citrus aromatics than the key lime (Citrus aurantifolia). The advantages of the <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> in commercial agriculture compared to the key lime are the larger size, absence of seeds, hardiness, absence of thorns on the bushes, and longer fruit shelf life. They are less acidic than key limes {{and do not have}} the bitterness that lends to the key lime's unique flavor.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT ‘Persian’ lime (PL) [Citrus latifolia (Yu. Tanaka) Tanaka] is an {{important}} species both for domestic fresh fruit consumption in Brazil {{as well as the}} export market, since the country {{is one of the largest}} producers in the world despite the fact that, in commercial plantations, it is still not uncommon to find trees with low productivity and high plant vigor of unknown origin. Selections of <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> ‘CNPMF– 2000 ’, ‘CNPMF– 2001 ’, ‘CNPMF– 01 ’, ‘CNPMF– 02 ’, ‘IAC– 5 ’, ‘IAC– 5. 1 ’, ‘Bearss’, ‘Persian– 58 ’, and ‘ 5059 ’, were therefore grafted onto Swingle citrumelo [C. paradisi Macfad. cv. Duncan × Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. ] rootstocks and evaluated in Cruz das Almas, Bahia, Brazil in a field experiment conducted in a completely randomized block design with five replications and two trees per plot. The biometric attributes (canopy height, diameter and volume), yield parameters (yield during the off-season harvest period, yield per plant, production efficiency), and fruit quality traits, were evaluated. The ‘CNPMF– 2001 ’, ‘CNPMF– 01 ’, ‘CNPMF– 02 ’, ‘IAC– 5 ’, and ‘Bearss’ selections had 5 - 11 % shorter trees than the other cultivars. ‘CNPMF– 01 ’, ‘CNPMF– 02 ’, ‘Persian– 58 ’, and ‘ 5059 ’ presented higher yield efficiency values, between 3. 1 - 3. 4 kg m− 3, and higher yield levels during the off-season harvest periods. The ‘Bearss’, ‘Persian– 58 ’, ‘CNPMF– 2000 ’, ‘IAC– 5. 1 ’ and ‘ 5059 ’ selections had more acid fruits and the latter three, smaller fruits. Based on their horticultural performance up to eight years of age, ‘CNPMF– 01 ’, ‘CNPMF– 02 ’, ‘Persian– 58 ’ and ‘ 5059 ’ selections were the most promising varieties of <b>Persian</b> <b>lime...</b>|$|E
40|$|Preventive {{antifungal}} {{activity of}} postharvest treatments with SPI (soy protein isolate) −coatings forming solutions against blue mould decay were evaluated on <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> (Citrus latifolia Tanaka) artificially inoculated in rind wounds with Penicillium italicum. Stimulatory effects were observed {{with the use}} of citral, however {{with the use of}} limonene an inhibitory effect was obtained. After 13 d of storage, significant preventive activity against blue mould was observed with a 20 % of disease incidence applying SPI-coating forming solutions with limonene added. SEM micrographs showed that limonene could act as an inhibitor of germ tube elongation, delaying the process of infection. Quality parameters like water losses, change in colour and aroma compounds release were assessed on fruit coated. Depending to storage condition, SPI-coating forming solutions were effective to reduce water losses, maintain colour and controlling the liberation of active agent...|$|E
40|$|The Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama is a {{destructive}} insect pest in citriculture, {{because it is}} an efficient vector of the proteobacteria ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ (Las), ‘Ca. L. africanus’ (Laf) and ‘Ca. L. americanus’ (Lam). These bacteria cause the ‘huanglongbing’ disease or ‘greening’ or ‘yellow dragon’ disease. The disease kills the plant and reduces fruit production. This insect pest is susceptible to entomopathogenic fungi, and we report the use of different strains of Metarhizium anisopliae, Cordyceps bassiana and Isaria fumosorosea against the nymphs and adults of D. citri under field conditions. The fungi were applied four times using a concentration of 2 £ 1013 conidia/ha with a time interval of 15 days between applications. The percentage of control of Cb 108, Ma 65, Ma 14 and Ifr 4 was 60, 50, 40 and 35 % in nymphs, and 50, 50, 42 and 22 % in adults, respectively. Metarhizium anisopliae, C. bassiana and I. fumosorosea applied on <b>Persian</b> <b>lime</b> groves are more effective in reducing higher density of nymphs than adults of D. citri...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of citrus {{production}} in Florida one of the diseases with a major impact has been the Asian form of citrus greening (HLB), which was first detected in 2005. As a response to this introduction, new survey and detection methods had to be developed utilizing field observations directed not only to corroborate symptoms already reported in the literature, but to describe any variations in symptomology observed on the different citrus varieties and their relatives growing in the area. Field and lab symptom studies were performed on Citrus aunantiifolia (Key/Mexican lime), C. aurantiifolia (<b>Persian</b> <b>lime),</b> C. aurantium (sour orange), C. jambhiri (rough lemon), C. limettioides (Palestine sweet lime), C. limon (lemon), C. limonia (Rangpur lime), C. maxima (pummelo), C. macrophylla (alemow), C. x paradisi (grapefruit), C. reticulata (mandarin-tangerine), C. reticulata X C. x paradisi (tangelo), C. sinensis (sweet orange), and Poncirus trifoliata (trifoliate orange) plants. The blotchy mottle symptom observed on the study plants support those described in the literature {{as the most important}} diagnostic symptom. Based on the results, training activities and materials were developed to compliment survey activities and sample collection protocols used to delimit and monitor the disease spread...|$|E
40|$|The State of São Paulo is {{the main}} Tahiti (<b>Persian)</b> <b>lime</b> {{producer}} in Brazil with 65 % of 43, 000 ha grown in Brazil.   In 2003, an experiment was planted in the Citrus Experimental Station (EECB), Bebedouro, Northern São Paulo State, {{with the objective of}} characterizing the performance of Tahiti acid lime grafted onto eight rootstocks: Davis A and Flying Dragon trifoliate oranges, Swingle citrumelo, HRS 849 [“citradia 1708 ” (Argentina trifoliate orange x Smooth Flat Sevile) ], Morton citrange, Rangur lime and Volkamer lemon, at 8 x 5 m spacing. In 2004, citrus huanglongbing (HLB), was first reported in the São Paulo State and the trees in the experiment started to show HLB symptoms in 2009. From July 2010 to May 2012, disease severity was evaluated four times and the bacteria titer quantified once. The numbers of qPCR positive replications were in a range of five to eight. Severity data was used to calculate the area under the disease severity progress curve (AUDSPC). The data were analyzed by Fisher LSD test (5 %). Flying Dragon and Davis A trifoliate oranges, and Swingle citrumelo, had lower values of AUDSPC, differing from Morton citrange, Orlando tangelo, Rangpur lime and Volkamer lemon. The citradia HRS 849 [citradia 1708 (Argentina trifoliate orange x Smooth Flat Sevile) had intermediate behavior. The canopies were removed but the rootstocks are still alive, so, new studies using the rootstock’s new shoots and the roots will be done aiming to quantify Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus titer in them and to confirm the rootstock’s tolerance identified in the canopies...|$|E
