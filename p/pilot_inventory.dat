40|$|Using schema theory, {{this study}} {{explored}} the knowledge structures that stepchildren hold about their stepfamilies. Two studies developed a reliable measure of six themes of step-family functioning. In Study 1, 251 adult and adolescent stepchildren completed a <b>pilot</b> <b>inventory.</b> Factor-analytic results reduced the <b>pilot</b> <b>inventory</b> from 192 items to 65 items and demonstrated that each dimension could be measured empirically. In Study 2, 586 adult and adolescent stepchildren completed the revised inventory and produced a new, multi-dimensional measure: The Stepfamily Life Index (SLI). Evidence of internal reliability and discriminant validity for the SLI is offered, and implications are discussed. KEY WORDS: avoidance • dissension • expressiveness • flexibility • involvement • schema • stepfamily life Over the last two decades, the stepfamily has {{captured the attention of}} social researchers across various disciplines. Defined by Ganong and Coleman (1994) as families in which ‘at least one of the adults has a child or children from a previous relationship ’ (p. 8), stepfamilies involve relationships that vary considerably in form, structure, and complexity. Although the amount of published research on stepfamilies tripled during the 1990 s (Coleman, Ganong, & Fine, 2000), the bulk of this research reflects a deficit-comparison approach (Ganong & Coleman, 1994). This deficit view relies on a model of the conventional ‘nuclear ’ family as th...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of stepfamilies {{and the fact that}} the amount of published research on stepfamilies tripled during the 1990 s (Coleman, Ganong, 2 ̆ 6 Fine, 2000), the overall study of stepfamilies lacks synthesis, order, and conceptual clarity. One possible way to organize investigations of stepfamilies is to classify stepfamilies according to their beliefs and experiences with significant issues and dimensions of stepfamily life. Since many of the complexities associated with stepfamily development are highly communicative in nature, the purpose of the present study was to develop a typology of stepfamily communication schemata. Using schema theory (Koerner 2 ̆ 6 Fitzpatrick, 2002; Schank, 1982; Wicks, 1992), the researcher developed the Stepfamily Dimensions Inventory (SDI), an inventory for assessing the primary dimensions of stepfamily communication and development. The researcher then identified and described a typology of stepfamily communication schemata using the final version of the SDI. ^ Two separate studies were conducted to develop the inventory and the typology. In Study 1, participants included 251 adult and adolescent stepchildren from the Midwest who completed a <b>pilot</b> <b>inventory.</b> The results of item analyses and factor analytic techniques reduced the <b>pilot</b> <b>inventory</b> from 232 items to 87 items, and provided initial evidence that the dimensions could be measured empirically. In Study 2, participants were 398 adult and adolescent stepchildren from the Midwest, and 188 adult and adolescent stepchildren from the Southwest (N = 586) who completed a questionnaire containing 104 items from the revised <b>pilot</b> <b>inventory</b> and 15 demographic questions. ^ The results of Study 2 produced a final version of the Stepfamily Dimensions Inventory (SDI), a 56 -item, empirically-reliable inventory that assesses stepchildren 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of stepfamily dissension, involvement, avoidance, flexibility, and expressiveness, as well as perceptions of their primary stepparent 2 ̆ 7 s credibility, (step) parental authority, and relational certainty. The results of cluster and discriminant analyses revealed five discrete types of stepfamily communication schemata, including Bonded, Functional, Indifferent, Avoidant, and Conflictual Stepfamilies. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings, as well as directions for future researchers, are discussed. ...|$|E

Typically, it is user complaints that prompt us to consider this monumental task; users lose confidence in the library catalog as well as the library itself when they are unable to find materials in the expected locations. The University of Mississippi Libraries conducted a <b>pilot</b> <b>inventory</b> of the Science Library to determine the feasibility of a full inventory of the Main Library’s one-million-plus collection. As a result of the pilot, modifications to the inventory process has made it more efficient and cost effective. Highlights from the <b>pilot</b> <b>inventory</b> are used as examples of issues encountered during a full inventory. Time and cost are primary concerns when considering inventory. The pros and cons of taking stock of one's collection will be presented as a lead-in to a discussion of the expected outcomes or goals of an inventory. In other words, what do you hope to accomplish by taking on this task? Dependent upon the goals of an inventory, libraries have the option of choosing an inventory method. An overview of the various inventory methods will be presented and alternatives will be discussed.

40|$|The {{retention}} of skilled pilots {{is a problem}} that plagues the United States Air Force. After spending millions of dollars on training and education, it is disheartening to see the mass exodus of experienced aviators from the Air Force that has been occurring in the past decade. Many blame the economy, others the Air Force itself, but few are able to accurately predict how or why they are all leaving. Complex adaptive systems theory might provide some insight. By modeling the system at the pilot’s level, allowing each pilot to be represented as an autonomous, independent agent continually adapting to its environment and the other agents in it, an alternate model can be built; one that accounts for the interactions among the pilots, not just their interactions with their environment. PICAS (<b>Pilot</b> <b>Inventory</b> Complex Adaptive System) is just such a model. Constructed in the Java language, the PICAS model exploits the notions of complex adaptive systems theory and employs dynamic user controls to discern retention rates over a pilot career time period. Pilots ‘evolve’, {{for lack of a better}} word, to a greater fitness within their environment, and in the process the model user can better determine what kind of environment needs to be created and maintained in order to ensure that trained and experienced pilots are in fact retained for their services beyond their initial service commitments. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop an}} {{inventory}} of biomedical physics elements-of-competence for diagnostic radiography education in Europe. Method: Research articles in the English literature and UK documentation pertinent to radiography education, competences and role development were subjected to a rigorous analysis of content from a functional and competence analysis perspective. Translations of radiography curricula from across Europe and relevant EU legislation were likewise analysed to ensure a pan-European perspective. Broad Subject Specific Competences for diagnostic radiography that included major biomedical physics components were singled out. These competences were in turn carefully deconstructed into specific elements-of-competence and those elements falling within the biomedical physics learning domain inventorised. A pilot version of the inventory was evaluated by participants during {{a meeting of the}} Higher Education Network for Radiography in Europe (HENRE), held in Marsascala, Malta, in November 2004. The inventory was further refined taking into consideration suggestions by HENRE members and scientific, professional and educational developments. Findings: The evaluation of the <b>pilot</b> <b>inventory</b> was very positive and indicated that the overall structure of the inventory was sensible, easily understood and acceptable – hence a good foundation for further development. Conclusions: Use of the inventory by radiography programme leaders and biomedical physics educators would guarantee that all necessary physics elements-of-competence underpinning the safe, effective and economical use of imaging devices are included within radiography curricula. It will also ensure the relevancy of physics content within radiography education. The inventory is designed to be a pragmatic tool for curriculum development across the entire range of radiography education up to doctorate level and irrespective of whether curriculum delivery is discipline-based or integrated, presentation-based or problem-based. It is suggested that the methodology used {{in the evolution of the}} inventory be applied to the development of inventories of elements-of-competence for other learning domains within health professional curricula. peer-reviewe...|$|E

The Floristic and Forest Inventory of Santa Catarina State (IFFSC) is an initiative of the state government and it was conceived in order to attend requirements of environmental laws. A <b>pilot</b> <b>inventory</b> took place in  2005; then the methodology was fitted to the proposal of the National Forest Inventory (IFN-BR) in discussion at the time. IFFSC is carried out since 2007 in all natural forest formations all over the state’s territory, including floristic sampling (collection of fertile trees, shrubs and herbs within the sample unit and in its surroundings) and survey of vascular epiphytes by specialized crews. The inventory applies a systematic sampling, with sample units containing clusters of four crosswise 1, 000 m² plots (20 m x 50 m), distributed systematically at the intersections of a 10 km x 10 km grid all over the state’s territory (a 5 km x 5 km grid is applied on highly fragmentized Seasonal Deciduous Forests). Methodological details and some important operational issues are discussed beyond the four years experience of IFFSC. Major sampling intensity and lower diameter and height thresholds (in the arboreal and regeneration strata) than in the nationwide inventory proposal (IFN-BR), as well as the execution of a floristic survey within and around the sample plots, showed to be important to record plant diversity of Santa Catarina’s forests. doi: 10. 4336 / 2010. pfb. 64. 291 Normal 0 21 false false false MicrosoftInternetExplorer 4  O objetivo do presente trabalho é contribuir à discussão sobre inventários florestais de abrangência regional e nacional, com enfoque em suas metodologias e em sua execução.

It {{is important to}} resolve the issue of whether extra infonnation can help assign the probability for failure of a pilot or Naval Flight Officer (NFO) in some phase of flight training. This assigned probability for failure could be based simply on empirical data gathered over some relatively long period of time. However, if scores from selection tests, personality tests, vision exams, psychomotor tests, and the like could serve as cogent infonnation about the probability for failure, then the probability for failure could be revised upwards or downwards based on an individual's standing on these variables. In·addition, {{it would be interesting to}} find out if candidates could "trade off " high scores on one class of tests for low scores on a different class of tests, but still achieve the same level of perronnance. Here, level of peIfonnance is defined as the probability for failure. This brings us into contact with the idea of isoperfonnance. In this analysis, we examine two classes of predictor variables where candidates might trade off high scores for low scores, yet still achieve the same level of performance. The ftrst class consists of cognitive infonnation processing variables. Scores for the ftnal academic grade from Aviation Pre-Flight Jndoctrination (API) will serve as an example of this class.

While the two countries contrast in many respects, in particular with respect to geography and the stage of economic development, they also share common features. Both are largely Buddhist countries, and both can be said to be at a critical stage in their socio-economic development, although in quite different ways. While Japan must find a way to overcome a decade of economic crisis and to cope with the requirements of post-modern development, Bhutan must find an answer to the questions of how to deal with the changes triggered by its fairly recent modernization policy and how to position itself in the global economy. The challenge for both is essentially the same: how can economic progress be harnessed for the happiness of the people?

The project began in March 1985, with the general design of inventory methodology, and preparation of the pilot survey; at the same time, the Forest Inventory Data Processing System, which had been designed by FAO, was installed in a computer in Jakarta. During phase two, the Forest Inventory and Forest Land-Use Planning Agency undertook the pilot survey. In phase three, the inventory consultant who had worked on phase one returned to Indonesia to review the results of the pilot study and to further develop the survey designThe national forest inventory which was to be conducted would identify and map, with the aid of Landsat imagery, the main areas of forest cover and the different types of land use; map logged areas; and estimate the standing volumes by major forest types, species and market groupings. The inventory results should be presented in formats which facilitate the use of this information in developing long-range management policies; standardized formats also help identify changes in future inventories. Seven and one-half years would be required for the national inventory, and multiphased sampling was recommended, beginning with those regions with the most pressing problems: eleven inventory regions have therefore been identified, and specific sampling plans would be needed for each regionIn the implementation of the nationwide inventory, due consideration should be given to forest structure and to the transport situation. As the seven inventory regions located in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku and Irian Java are remote, there could be major internal transport problems, and well-trained crews with strong helicopter support would be needed. Implementation should begin in central Kalimantan, using the detailed specifications developed by the project; then the trained crews should be made available to the other areas which are remote. Given the easy access by road to the forests of Sumatra, the inventory there could begin simultaneously with the work in central Kalimantan. The inventory methodology may need to be modified {{to take into account the}} atypical features of the forests in Java and Nusa Jenggar...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was {{an investigation into}} the process of forgiveness. The analysis of qualitative interviews with nearly 100 participants suggested four different approaches, or styles, of forgiving and non-forgiving. The Intrapersonal style describes people who forgive other people by focusing on their own thoughts, feelings, and actions. The Interpersonal style describes people who forgive other people by focusing on the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the offending persons. The Easy Going style describes the people who never forgive anyone because they rarely or never feel offended and consequently rarely or never feel the need to forgive others. The Grudge Holder style describes people who rarely or never forgive anyone because they generally prefer {{to hold on to the}} offense for various reasons. The 26 item <b>Pilot</b> CFSI <b>inventory</b> was investigated for reliability and for convergent and divergent validity in a sample composed of 131 undergraduate and graduate students. Cronbachs’ alphas of the scales showed the Pilot Caperton Forgiveness Style Inventory (CFSI) inventory to be internally consistent. Multiple regressions of CFSI scale results with IPIP Five Factor Model of Personality inventories, Fear-of-Intimacy relationship anxiety inventories, and demographic information demonstrated appropriate divergent validity for the scales. These results along with a varimax rotation factor analysis led to an 18 item Revised CFSI and a three item Humility scale which clearly mediated the forgiving process in some as yet to be determined way and was wholly unrelated to the non- iv forgiving styles. The Intrapersonal forgivers tended to score high on Openness and somewhat higher on Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. They also scored low on fear of intimate relationships. Individuals who reported being “very active in religion” were the only group which showed a preference for the Intrapersonal style. The Interpersonal forgivers tended to score high on Neuroticism, Extroversion, and Conscientiousness, and they also tended to score low on fear of intimate relationships. The Easy Going non-forgivers scored low on Neuroticism, but scored high on fear of intimate relationships. Males were more likely to score high on Easy Going than any other demographic group. The Grudge Holders tended to score high on Neuroticism and low on Agreeableness, and they were high on fear of intimate relationships. The Caperton Forgiveness Style Inventory is a valid and reliable assessment tool of styles of forgiveness and is appropriate for both clinical and research uses.

40|$|Background and objectives: Students’ {{perceptions}} of their educational environment (EE) have been studied in undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. The Ambulatory Care Learning Educational Environment Measure (ACLEEM) is an inventory that was recently developed to measure the EE in postgraduate ambulatory settings. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the psychometric properties of the inventory. Methods: A mixed methodology was used to develop the ACLEEM including: Grounded theory (8 focus groups); a two-round Delphi technique to identify consensus; and a <b>pilot</b> study. The <b>inventory</b> was refined to 50 -items after the pilot study and it was prospectively administered to a large cohort of clerks and residents in Chile during 2010 - 2011. Psychometric measurements included factor analysis followed by Varimax rotation for construct validity, Cronbach's alpha coefficients for internal consistency and Generalizability theory for test reliability. Results: Four-hundred and eleven students responded: 151 clerks (83. 9 % of the target population) and 260 residents (74 % of the target population) from 31 postgraduate programs. The factor analyses showed an eight factor instrument. ACLEEM was found highly reliable with a Cronbach's alpha of 0. 94 and D-study revealed a reliable outcome for residency programs with at least 15 respondents with a G coefficient of 0. 831. The EE perceived by residents and clerks was positive without differences between groups: 152. 52 ± 23. 36 (76. 26 %) and 150. 61 ± 24. 62 (75. 30 %), respectively (p= 0. 761). Conclusions: The 50 -item ACLEEM inventory is a multidimensional and valid instrument requiring only 15 respondents for reliable results. We recommend using it to measure the EE in the ambulatory postgraduate Spanish-speaking programs...|$|R
40|$|The forest {{resources}} in Ethiopia have suffered decades of mismanagement due mainly to loosely defined property relations over these resources. As {{one of the}} solutions, Participatory Forest Management (PFM) scheme was introduced during the early 1990 s by some NGOs. Nearly two decades of experience now exists in the country. However systematic assessments {{of the performance of}} the scheme are scanty. This study reports the experience from Bonga PFM project, {{which is one of the}} oldest <b>pilot</b> sites. Forest <b>inventory</b> and socio-economic survey were conducted to collect data. The study was conducted during a transition from NGO - Community to State - Community based management of the PFM project. PFM is shown to have positive impacts both on the state of the forest and living condition of participant households at least within the project life time. Forest conditions such as seedling and sapling densities improved. PFM also (i) promoted awareness about forest, (ii) capacitated locals to form new institutional arrangement that increased their participation in forest management, helped to reduce open access and assisted a regulated forest use, and (iii) contributed towards social equity in terms of gender and minority ethnic groups. When accompanied with complementary non-forest based livelihood activities, PFM helped to diversify income sources, increase household income level, and build household assets. This reduced dependence of communities on forests for livelihoods. A challenge threatening the sustainability of the PFM program in Ethiopia is the weak government support for the scheme. PFM is still far from being mainstreamed in the forest management system of the country. Thus, it will be appropriate to assess how the PFM programs would perform few years after the support of the NGOs terminates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConcentrated (40 wt %) {{piperazine}} (PZ) with two-stage flash regeneration is {{an advanced}} second generation amine-based process for CO 2 capture. Two pilot campaigns with the two-stage flash process were completed in 2011 and successfully demonstrated high temperature stripping at 150 °C with concentrated piperazine. Data reconciliation for the absorber with intercooling return spray was completed using Aspen Plus® Data-Fit. Data reconciliation for the two-stage flash with warm rich bypass was completed using Aspen Plus® Data-Fit and a dynamic model developed in MATLAB®. The results of data reconciliation analysis {{found that the}} CO 2 loading in the lean and rich streams needed to be systematically shifted upward, 4. 6 – 4. 7 % in the stripper analysis and 7. 5 % in the absorber analysis. An analysis of the October 2011 campaign pilot plant data identified the two configurations with the lowest equivalent work as the high temperature two-stage flash with warm rich bypass and low pressure simple stripper. The calculated equivalent work for the two-stage flash with warm rich bypass from raw pilot plant data and reconciled pilot plant data is approximately 35 kJ/mol CO 2 and 36. 6 kJ/mol CO 2, respectively. Intercooling with a spray return improved absorber CO 2 removal performance by 6 – 7 % at the lower gas rates and {{was found to be}} equivalent to a 7 – 20 % increase in packing height based on reconciled data results. Warm rich bypass to the low pressure flash tank reduced piperazine volatility by factor of two in the condensate. In addition, analysis of the <b>pilot</b> plant piperazine <b>inventory</b> {{at the end of the}} campaign identified the following degradation products (mmol/kg) : N-formyl PZ (1. 3), ethylenediamine (13), aminoethylpiperazine (3. 6), Hydroxyethylpiperazine (3. 9), formate (1. 0), and N-nitroso- piperazine (0. 09). The solvent analysis also found that the CO 2 capacity has decreased by 17 %, with a slight decrease in CO 2 absorption rate and heat of vaporization...|$|R
40|$|In {{the period}} from 1990 to mid 1993, a {{consortium}} of three institutes were commissioned by the German Environment Office (Umweltbundesamt) to develop a comprehensive methodology for drawing up Life Cycle Inventories for products. This work was carried out {{under the leadership of}} the Fraunhofer Institute (FhILV) in Munich and resulted in considerable data generation. In the studies concerning the manufacture and processing of packaging materials, a group of companies belonging to the Industry Group for Food Technology and Packaging (Industrievereinigung für Lebensmitteltechnologie und Verpackung e. V.) lent their participation by making available industrial data on the manufacture and processing of packaging materials. For one pilot area, concerning different recyclable and refillable packaging systems for fresh milk and beer distribution, results from Life Cycle Inventories were presented to the German Environment Office in June 1993. The Environment Minister at the time (Töpfer) made the information public in September 1993. Life Cycle Inventories for products consist of {{a very large number of}} individual, environmentally relevant facts (150 - 200 facts per balance) and thus no conclusions can be immediately drawn from the information. Our workers were acutely aware of this and had made this point clear on several occasions. They had also indicated the need for an aggregation method for the relevant environmental burdens (an Impact Assessment). This was a task left to the German Environment Office. In July 1994 a study was presented by the Office which, via a complicated and multi-stepped Impact Assessment, finally led to ecological judgement of packaging systems. In a workshop in September 1994, a panel of experts commented on the working methodology and judgements mostly with scepticism. A key point of criticism here was the Office's endeavour to find exaggerated, one-dimensional judgements instead of the internationally respected multi-dimensional "Improvement" approach. Characteristic here was the German Office's "impulse" to look at representative, average situations concerning packaging system usage and not at the factors which largely influence Life Cycle Inventory results, factors, that may - under realistic circumstances - lead to conclusions much different from those drawn from looking at an average situation. In view of this working philosophy, the German Council for Packaging commissioned the Fraunhofer Institute in September 1993 to aggregate the environmental effects and burdens for a number of <b>pilot</b> Life Cycle <b>Inventories.</b> This work required inter-disciplinary teamwork and, at the initiative of the Fraunhofer Institute, a circle of experts was formed in Munich to lay down the conditions required for the aggregation methods...|$|R
