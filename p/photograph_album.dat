5|$|Farsari sold many {{of these}} {{photograph}} albums, particularly to foreign residents and visitors. He employed excellent artists who each produced high-quality work at a pace {{of two or three}} hand-coloured prints per day. Farsari ensured that the colours were true to life and that the best materials were used. Accordingly, his work was expensive, yet popular and often praised by clients and visitors to Japan, even receiving a glowing reference by Rudyard Kipling following his 1889 visit to Yokohama. That same year, Farsari presented a deluxe <b>photograph</b> <b>album</b> to the King of Italy. By the 1890s, the studio's high reputation earned it exclusive rights to photograph the Imperial Gardens in Tokyo.|$|E

Known as The Laurence Olivier Archive, the collection includes many of Vivien Leigh's personal papers, including numerous letters she wrote to Olivier. The papers of Vivien Leigh, including letters, photographs, contracts and diaries, are owned by her daughter, Mrs. Suzanne Farrington. In 1994 the National Library of Australia purchased a <b>photograph</b> <b>album,</b> monogrammed [...] "L & V O" [...] and believed to have belonged to the Oliviers, containing 573 photographs of the couple during their 1948 tour of Australia. It is now held {{as part of the}} record {{of the history of the}} performing arts in Australia. In 2013, an archive of Vivien Leigh's letters, diaries, photographs, annotated film and theatre scripts and her numerous awards was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E

500|$|Federal troops {{combed the}} rural area's woods and swamps for Booth {{in the days}} {{following}} the assassination, as the nation experienced an outpouring of grief. On April 18, mourners waited seven abreast in a mile-long line outside the White House for the public viewing of the slain president, reposing in his open walnut casket in the black-draped East Room. A cross of lilies was at the head and roses covered the coffin's lower half. Thousands of mourners arriving on special trains jammed Washington for the next day's funeral, sleeping on hotel floors and even resorting to blankets spread outdoors on the Capitol's lawn. Prominent abolitionist leader and orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an [...] "unspeakable calamity" [...] for African Americans. Great indignation was directed towards Booth as the assassin's identity was telegraphed across the nation. Newspapers called him an [...] "accursed devil," [...] "monster," [...] "madman," [...] and a [...] "wretched fiend." [...] Historian Dorothy Kunhardt writes: [...] "Almost every family who kept a <b>photograph</b> <b>album</b> on the parlor table owned a likeness of John Wilkes Booth of the famous Booth family of actors. After the assassination Northerners slid the Booth card out of their albums: some threw it away, some burned it, some crumpled it angrily." [...] Even in the South, sorrow was expressed in some quarters. In Savannah, Georgia, the mayor and city council addressed a vast throng at an outdoor gathering to express their indignation, and many in the crowd wept. Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston called Booth's act [...] "a disgrace to the age". Robert E. Lee also expressed regret at Lincoln's death by Booth's hand.|$|E

These albums came in both 10-inch and 12-inch sizes.

2500|$|The vogue for {{portrait}} drawings intensified during Catherine de' Medici's life, and she {{may have}} regarded part of her collection as the equivalent of today's family <b>photograph</b> <b>album.</b> Catherine loved having her children painted: [...] "I would like", she wrote in 1547 to her children's governor, Jean d'Humières, [...] "to have paintings of all the children done [...] [...] [...] and sent to me, without delay, {{as soon as they}} are finished". However, the more formal pictures include a high proportion of portraits of European kings and queens, past and present, most of which she probably commissioned personally. On 3 July 1571, Catherine wrote to Monsieur de la Mothe-Fénelon, ambassador in London, discussing the work of François Clouet and requesting a portrait of Queen Elizabeth. Catherine gave detailed instructions: [...] "I pray you do me the pleasure that I may soon have a painting of the queen of England of small volume, in great , and that it be well portrayed and done in the same fashion as the one sent be by the earl of Leicester, and ask, as I already have one in full face, {{it would be better to}} have her turning to the right." ...|$|E
