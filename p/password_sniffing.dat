50|$|Dsniff {{is a set}} of <b>password</b> <b>sniffing</b> {{and network}} traffic {{analysis}} tools written by security researcher and startup founder Dug Song to parse different application protocols and extract relevant information. dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and webspy passively monitor a network for interesting data (passwords, e-mail, files, etc.). arpspoof, dnsspoof, and macof facilitate the interception of network traffic normally unavailable to an attacker (e.g., due to layer-2 switching). sshmitm and webmitm implement active man-in-the-middle attacks against redirected SSH and HTTPS sessions by exploiting weak bindings in ad-hoc PKI.|$|E
50|$|SecurID {{authentication}} server tries to prevent <b>password</b> <b>sniffing</b> and simultaneous login by declining both authentication requests, if two valid credentials are presented {{within a given}} time frame. This has been documented in an unverified post by John G. Brainard. If the attacker removes from the user the ability to authenticate however, the SecurID server will assume {{that it is the}} user who is actually authenticating and hence will allow the attacker's authentication through. Under this attack model, the system security can be improved using encryption/authentication mechanisms such as SSL.|$|E

50|$|By default, RFB is not {{a secure}} protocol. While {{passwords}} are not sent in plain-text (as in telnet), cracking could prove successful if both the encryption key and encoded <b>password</b> are <b>sniffed</b> from a network. For this reason {{it is recommended that}} a password of at least 8 characters be used. On the other hand, there is also an 8-character limit on some versions of VNC; if a password is sent exceeding 8 characters, the excess characters are removed and the truncated string is compared to the password.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — User {{authentication}} {{is still}} heavily reliant {{on the use}} of passwords, and the security problems associated with passwords {{are becoming more and more}} serious. The main causes of these problems are the prevalence of <b>password</b> <b>sniffing</b> and the difficulty of password management due to the increased number of accessible systems. In this paper, we propose a personal password management system called "One Touch Logon”, which replaces the annoying password-based authentication systems with a simple touch-and-login method. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated by implementing it on widely-used legacy systems such as Microsoft Windows and Web site logons. This mechanism is easy to implement and integrate with current password-based systems through the use of an inexpensive consumer electronic device allowing for fingerprint recognition. Moreover, eliminating the burden of memorizing multiple passwords enables the user to choose hard-to-guess passwords and further increases the utilization of Internet services while improving their accessibility. Our empirical study shows that One Touch Logon gives more benefits as the number of employing sites increases, especially when exceeding the number three 1.

Some are spoofing attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and its various forms (like ping attacks, smurfing etc), <b>password</b> <b>sniffing,</b> packet capturing along with traffic analysis and other wireless key cracking attacks. Many of these attacks steal someone's identity and use it for exploiting the victim or others by masquerading or forgery, made the network or computer system inoperable by interrupting normal services, created a back door for re-visits etc. In this paper we analyze some of these attacks and evaluate its effectiveness, concluding with some security recommendations...|$|E

Not With data storage and processing snowballing into a necessity from being an efficient part of any business process or organization, the need for securing storage at various degrees of granularity is gaining considerable interest. The challenge in designing an encrypted file system stems from balancing performance, security perception, ease of usage and enterprise level deploy ability. Often, the most secure solutions may not even be the best solution either due to hit on performance or due to decreased usability. Further, narrowing the trust circle to exclude even hitherto trusted system administrators makes creating an encrypted file system a huge engineering exercise...|$|E

40|$|Once attackers have {{penetrated}} a system, {{they will}} usually {{take advantage of}} their position by extending their reach to compromise other systems (e. g., by <b>sniffing</b> <b>passwords</b> from the network), and by installing "back doors" that will enable them to regain access even if the original insecurity is repaired. A common approach is to install a modified version of a standard system daemon such as telnetd. It is also common for attackers to attempt to cover their tracks by installing doctored versions of standard programs like ls, ps and sum. Programs like this, which conceal something harmful inside a harmless looking exterior, are called Trojan Horses. CryptoMark detects Trojan Horses as they are about to be activated. It is similar in its goals to Kim and Spafford's Tripwire, but detects intrusions with lower latency. That is, rather than laying dormant until the system administrator next runs a Tripwire integrity check, CryptoMark would detect a Trojan Horse as soon as it is run. Another [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an active {{attack against the}} Transport Control Protocol (TCP) which allows a cracker to redirect the TCP stream through his machine thereby permitting him to bypass the protection offered by such a system as a one-time password [SKEY] or ticketing authentication [Kerberos].

Some schemes to detect this attack are presented {{as well as some}} methods of prevention and some interesting details of the TCP protocol behaviors. 1 Introduction Passive attacks using sniffers {{are becoming more and more}} frequent on the Internet. The attacker obtains a user id and password that allows him to logon as that user.

40|$|Abstract—Botnets are {{responsible}} for many large scale organized Internet attacks today. Along with the fight between botnet developers and defenders, the battle field has significantly evolved from traditional centralized IRC to various new approaches, aiming to make bots and command and control channel more and more stealthy. In this work, through prototype implementations, we demonstrate that browser extensions are a very effective botnet vehicle with very large installation base and the capability of accessing rich sensitive user data in the browser. The automatic update mechanism of browser extensions further offers a stealthy command and control channel between bots and a botmaster. Compared to many others, extension-based bots are more stealthy and harder to defeat since all mainstream browser architectures provide rich APIs for browser extensions to enrich users’ browsing experience with insufficient consideration of malicious extensions. Via both an IE add-on and a Chrome extension, we show that attacks like email spamming, DDoS, and <b>password</b> <b>sniffing</b> are trivially feasible. Our study shows that an effective scheme is imperatively demanded to mitigate such threats. I...|$|E

40|$|To {{encourage}} {{users to}} use {{stronger and more}} secure pass-words, modern web browsers offer users password man-agement services, allowing users to save previously en-tered passwords locally onto their hard drives. We present Lupin, a tool that automatically extracts these saved pass-words without the user’s knowledge. Lupin allows a net-work adversary to obtain passwords {{as long as the}} login form appears on a non-HTTPS page. Unlike existing <b>password</b> <b>sniffing</b> tools, Lupin can obtain passwords for websites users are not visiting. Furthermore, Lupin can extract passwords embedded in login forms with a destina-tion address served in HTTPS. To determine the number of websites vulnerable to our attack, we crawled the top 45, 000 most popular websites from Alexa’s top website list and discovered that at least 28 % of these sites are vulnerable. To further demonstrate the feasibility of our attack, we tested Lupin under controlled conditions using one of the authors ’ computers. Lupin was able to extract passwords from 1, 000 websites in less than 35 seconds. We suggest techniques for web developers to protect their web applications from attack, and we propose alternative designs for a secure password manager. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is to identify the vulnerability attack {{that focus on the}} ARP spoofing attack in the Android platform. This is because each of attacks likes Man-In-The-Middle, Session Hijacking and <b>Password</b> <b>Sniffing</b> are occurring cause of ARP spoofing attack. After that, this research continues with studying about the active technique: ARP request and TCPSYN injection of packet that intend for detecting the ARP spoofing attack. This technique is better than the passive technique that also used for detection of the ARP spoofing. The passive technique is not effective to use because it takes time too long to detect and report the attack. Additionally, if the MAC addresses flooding into the ARP cache on switch with ARP requests and replies may lead to new report tables every time which makes it is unreliable. Next, {{at the end of this}} research will develop an Android application for applying the active technique as a method to detect and prevent the ARP spoofing attack on Android smartphone. The Android application will be developed by using Java programming language. The main aim here is that Android application can avoid the attacker steal the Android user's information by launching some attacks that started with the ARP spoofing attack...|$|E

One of the methods to secure the information is Cryptography. It Protects data transmitted over the network lines, is mainly through appropriate Encryption techniques. The subject Cryptography deals with the encryption and decryption procedures. Encryption is the process of scrambling information so that it becomes unintelligible and can be unscrambled only by using keys. Encryption is the achieved using a Symmetric (or) Asymmetric Encryption. In Symmetric Encryption, a single key is used encrypt as well as to decrypt. In Asymmetric Encryption, two keys namely public and private key are used for encryption and decryption. The paper presentation is on the Authenticated Transmission using Quantum Security. Quantum cryptography is a new method, which is efficient and fastest of all methods to secure the information. In this Quantum cryptography, main concept is Quantum theory of light, polarization. The foundation of Quantum cryptography lies in the Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle which states that “certain pairs of physical properties are related {{in such a way that}} measuring one property prevents the observer from simultaneously knowing the value of other”...|$|E
