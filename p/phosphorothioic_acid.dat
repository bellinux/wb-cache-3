40|$|This work {{presents}} {{laboratory studies}} {{on the degradation of}} triazophos in intertidal sediment. The overall degradations were found to follow the first-order decay model. After being incubated for 6 d, the percentage of degradations of triazophos in unsterilized and sterilized sediments were 94. 5 % and 20. 5 %, respectively. Between the temperatures of 15 degrees C and 35 degrees C, the observed degradation rate constant(k(obsd)) enhanced as the incubation temperature increased. Triazophos in sediment degraded faster under aerobic condition than under anaerobic one. The water content of sediment had little influence on the degradation when it was in the range of 50 %- 100 %. The values of k(obsd) decreased with increasing initial concentration of triazophos in sediment, which could result from the microorganism inhibition by triazophos. Four major degradation products, o, o-diethyl <b>phosphorothioic</b> <b>acid,</b> monoethyl <b>phosphorothioic</b> <b>acid,</b> <b>phosphorothioic</b> <b>acid,</b> and 1 -phenyl- 3 -hydroxy- 1, 2, 4 -triazole, were tentatively identified as their corresponding trimethylsilyl derivatives with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. The possible degradation pathway of triazophos in intertidal sediment was proposed. The results revealed that triazophos in intertidal sediment was relatively unstable and could be easily degraded...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of parathion {{has been}} examined {{by use of}} a reconstituted mixed-function oxidase enzyme system isolated from the livers of phenobarbital-pretreated rabbits. The cyto-chrome P- 450 used in these studies was apparently homogeneous as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by assay of the preparation for contami-nating microsomal enzymes and enzyme activity. These studies revealed that the apparently homogeneous preparation of cytochrome P- 450, {{in the presence of}} the appropriate cofactors. can catalyze the conversions of parathion to both paraoxon and diethyl <b>phosphorothioic</b> <b>acid.</b> The present studies have also shown that parathion is metabolized by the reconstituted mixed-function oxidase enzyme system to diethyl phosphoric acid, a product which, in previous studies with intact liver microsomes. had been thought to arise exclusively from the hydrolysis of para-oxon by a microsomal esterase(s). The available data suggest that all three of the products of the metabolism of parathion by the reconstituted mixed-function oxidase enzyme system. namely. paraoxon. diethyl <b>phosphorothioic</b> <b>acid,</b> and diethyl phosphoric acid, are formed nonenzymatic-ally by breakdown by different pathways of a common enzymatically formed intermediate.

40|$|Triazophos is a {{contaminant}} of wastewater at manufacturing facilities, and remediative {{treatment may}} be needed. While toxicity and persistence limit {{the effectiveness of}} biological and physicochemical methods, photo-Fenton processes are promising. UV-Fenton and solar-Fenton processes were applied to degrade triazophos. The optimum parameters were 50 mmol/L H 2 O 2, 0. 3 mmol/L FeSO 4, and pH 3. 0. The decomposition of triazophos by a photo-Fenton process followed first-order kinemics. At 30 C, the half-life of triazophos in a UV-Fenton process ranged from 9. 1 min at 2. 0 x 10 (5) Lx to 27. 3 min at 1. 0 x 10 (5) Lx. At 35 degreesC and with solar irradiation luminance, it ranged within 1. 0 x 10 (5) - 1. 2 x 10 (5) Lx; the half-life of triazophos in the solar-Fenton process was 11. 2 min. Five major degradation products, O,O-diethyl <b>phosphorothioic</b> <b>acid,</b> monoethyl <b>phosphorothioic</b> <b>acid,</b> phosphorothloic acid, 1 -phenyl- 3 -hydroxy- 1, 2, 4 -triazole, and phenylsemicarbazine, were tentatively identified as their corresponding trimethylsilyl derivatives with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer.

40|$|International audienceTwo novel impedimetric biosensors {{for highly}} {{sensitive}} and rapid quantitative detection of diazinon in aqueous medium were developed using {{two types of}} lipase, from Candida Rugosa (microbial source) (CRL) and from porcine pancreas (animal source) (PPL) immobilized on functionalized gold electrode. Lipase is characterized to specifically catalyze the hydrolysis of ester functions leading to the transformation of diazinon into diethyl <b>phosphorothioic</b> <b>acid</b> (DETP) and 2 -isopropyl- 4 -methyl- 6 -hydroxypyrimidine (IMHP). The developed biosensors both presented {{a wide range of}} linearity up to 50 M with a detection limit of 10 nM for Candida Rugosa biosensor and 0. 1 RM for porcine pancreas biosensor. A comparative study was carried out between the two biosensors and results showed higher efficiency of Candida Rugosa sensor. Moreover, it presented good accuracy and reproducibility, had very good storage and multiple use stability for 25 days when stored at 4 degrees C...|$|E
40|$|Fensulfothion (O,O-diethyl O-[4 -(methylsulfinyl) phenyl]phosphorothioate), an organophosphorus {{pesticide}} {{used to control}} the golden nematode Heterodera rostochiensis, {{is used as a}} source of carbon by microorganisms isolated from soils treated with the pesticide. Two of the microbial isolates, Pseudomonas alcaligenes C 1 and Alcaligenes sp. strain NC 3, used more than 80 % of the pesticide in 120 h in culture when supplemented as a source of carbon. P. alcaligenes C 1, which showed maximal growth on fensulfothion, degraded the compound to p-methylsulfinyl phenol and diethyl <b>phosphorothioic</b> <b>acid.</b> The phenolic metabolite could be identified by conventional spectral analysis, whereas the spectral patterns of the phosphorus-containing metabolite suggested that the compound was complexed with some cellular molecules. However, utilization of the phosphoric acid ester and ethanol by P. alcaligenes C 1 suggested that the microbe attacks fensulfothion by an initial hydrolysis of the compound and subsequent utilization of the phosphoric acid ester. The pathway of degradation of fensulfothion by P. alcaligenes is of great value in the detoxification of the pesticide residues and also in the environmentally stable phosphoric acid esters...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{sublethal}} gamma radiation on inbred mice chronically infected with scrub typhus rickettsiae was examined. Inbred mice which were inoculated with the Gilliam or Karp strain of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi by the subcutaneous route harbored the infection {{for at least}} 1 year. Irradiation of these animals at 12 or 52 weeks postinoculation with normally sublethal levels induced a significantly higher percentage of rickettsemic mice (recrudescence) than {{was seen in the}} unirradiated, similarly infected control animals. In addition, sublethal irradiation at 12 weeks induced a quantitative increase in total rickettsiae. Homologous antibody titers to the rickettsiae were examined for 5 weeks after irradiation to determine the role of the humoral response in radiation-induced recrudescence. Unirradiated, infected mice showed consistent titers of about 320 throughout the 5 -week observation period, and the titer was not affected by exposure of up to 500 rads of gamma radiation. Drug dose-dependent radioprotection and modification of recrudescence was noted in infected, irradiated mice treated with the antiradiation compound S- 2 -(3 -aminopropylamino) ethyl <b>phosphorothioic</b> <b>acid.</b> The results of this investigation supported the conclusion that the recrudescence of a chronic rickettsial infection in the appropriate host after immunological impairment due to gamma radiation can result in an acute, possibly lethal rickettsemia...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} the organophosphorous {{insecticide}} fenitrothion (<b>phosphorothioic</b> <b>acid,</b> O,O-dimethyl O-(3 -methyl- 4 -nitrophenyl) ester; FS) on the physical state of pure dipalmitoyl (DPPC) and 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) membranes were investigated. FS lowers the phase transition temperature of DPPC. It has no large effects on the DPPC gel phase, but it increases {{the order of the}} liquid-crystalline state of DPPC and POPC. FS also decreases 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene (DPH) lifetime (τ) in the DPPC and POPC liquid-crystalline states. Since a direct quenching of DPH emission by FS was ruled out, τ shortening is assigned to an increased water penetration in the bilayer. The effect of FS is different from most perturbing agents for which an increased order is accompanied by a higher τ. Furthermore, quenching of DPH by KI was increased by FS in POPC liposomes indicating an increased accessibility of the quencher to the hydrophobic core where DPH distributes. The effect of FS on dipole relaxation at the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interface of POPC bilayers was studied with 2 -dimethylamino- 6 -lauroylnaphthalene (Laurdan). FS produces a decrease in Laurdan τ and a narrowing of its emission band. FS significantly increases the generalized polarization values at both emission band ends. These results indicate that FS may allow the coexistence of microdomains that have different physical properties...|$|E
