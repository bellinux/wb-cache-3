50|$|A common {{alteration}} to the Stille coupling is {{the incorporation}} of a carbonyl group between R1 and R2, serving as an efficient method to form ketones. This process is extremely similar to the initial exploration by Migita and Stille (see History) of coupling organostannane to acyl chlorides. However, these moieties are not always readily available and {{can be difficult to}} form, especially in the presence of sensitive functional groups. Furthermore, controlling their high reactivity can be challenging. The Stille-carbonylative cross-coupling employs the same conditions as the Stille coupling, except with an atmosphere of carbon monoxide (CO) being used. The CO can coordinate to the palladium catalyst (9) after initial oxidative addition, followed by CO insertion into the Pd-R1 bond (10), resulting in subsequent reductive elimination to the ketone (12). The transmetalation step is normally the rate-determining step.Larry Overman and coworkers make use of the Stille-carbonylative cross-coupling in their 20-step enantioselective total synthesis of strychnine. The added carbonyl is later converted to a terminal alkene via a Wittig reaction, allowing for the key tertiary nitrogen and the pentacyclic core to be formed via an aza-Cope-Mannich reaction.Giorgio Ortar et al. explored how the Stille-carbonylative cross-coupling could be used to synthesize benzophenone <b>phosphores.</b> These were embedded into 4-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine peptides and used for their photoaffinity labelling properties to explore various peptide-protein interactions.Louis Hegedus' 16-step racemic total synthesis of Jatraphone involved a Stille-carbonylative cross-coupling as its final step to form the 11-membered macrocycle. In lieu of a hailde, a vinyl triflate is used there as the coupling partner.|$|R
40|$|L'étude des phénomènes d'eutrophisation se heurte essentiellement à deux difficultés qui sont inhérentes d'une part, à la diversité spatio-temporelle des eaux superficielles, et d'autre part, à l'action qu'exercent en retour les phénomènes d'eutrophisation sur ces eaux. - La diversité spatio-temporelle des systèmes aquatiques s'accompagne d'une diversité des phénomènes d'eutrophisation qui en sont le siège et a pour conséquence de rendre difficile sinon {{impossible}} l'établissement de critères de comparaisons entre les différents systèmes aquatiques. Dans ces conditions il est peu aisé de faire le choix objectif d'un état de référence universel qui seul permettrait de déterminer de manière absolue le niveau trophique d'une eau. - La deuxième difficulté, et sans doute la plus grande, est liée à l'action qu'exercent les phénomènes d'eutrophisation sur les variables analytiques du système. Cette action a pour conséquence de rendre les valeurs intrinsèques de ces variables impropres à l'étude de ces phénomènes et de leur évolution. Ces variables étant liées simultanément aux causes et aux conséquences des diverses manifestations des phénomènes d'eutrophisation. Les 10 lacs que nous avons étudié ici, présentent l'avantage peu courant d'être alimentés par les mêmes eaux traversant une zone géographique restreinte et par conséquent géologique et climatique identique. Ils sont soumis à l'influence d'activités agricoles ou urbaines différentes mais bien identifiées, entraînant pour ces eaux des caractéristiques trophiques différentes. Dans un tel cas, il aurait pu sembler {{a priori}} possible d'établir une classification des différents états trophiques des lacs. Cependant, même dans une situation aussi idéale, et essentiellement à cause des deux difficultés mentionnées précédemment, nous tentons de montrer ici qu'il n'en est rien. Cela amène les commentaires d'ordre général suivants:- Si pour le système lacustre étudié ici, probablement parmi les plus idéaux, il est difficile à partir des critères généralement retenus dans la plupart des études, (nutriments azotés, <b>phosphorés,</b> chlorophylle, oxygène dissous, etc.) d'établir un classement trophique, il semble a fortiori peu probable que cela puisse être réalisé sur des systèmes moins idéaux. - La littérature actuelle fait clairement apparaître ce problème majeur. Cependant pour y remédier, elle propose généralement de faire le choix d'autres indicateurs physico-chimiques ou même biologiques qui, pour les mêmes raisons, semblent également voués à l'échec. En conclusion de cette étude, nous proposons donc d'abandonner de tels indicateurs liés au milieu et de choisir de nouveaux critères qui prendraient en compte les perturbations apportées par le phénomène aux interactions liant les variables analytiques: les différents états trophiques d'une eau étant probablement mieux caractérisés par les différents états des relations liants les variables analytiques que par les valeurs intrinsèques de ces variables. One {{of the problems}} water managers and researchers have {{had to deal with}} for a long time is that of identifying the symptoms of eutrophication, with all its multiple facets. The search for a simplified model of this complex process does not seem, so far, to have attained this objective. In order to identify and classify the various trophic states of waters (lakes or rivers), two main types of trophic indicators have been and are still being used, those belonging to the biocenosis (biological factors) and those belonging to the biotope (physical-chemical factors). - The aim of the biological approach to eutrophication is to measure its impact on the environment's biodiversity. Thus, several classification indices have been drawn up, for example: the Biotic Index, {{which is one of the}} oldest; the General Quality Biological Index, which has been improved to become the Normalised Global Biological Index (NGBI) method; and more recently the Trophic Diatom Index. Working with such indices requires quite complex analyses since it is necessary to identify the local fauna and flora. Furthermore, these indices only apply to rivers, not to lentic environments. - For the physical-chemical approach, the aim is to quantify the trophic state of an aquatic environment by measuring a number of physical-chemical parameters. This approach is easier to implement and the results provided are those currently used by water managers. It is obvious that the two approaches are linked, since the biodiversity of an aquatic environment is conditioned by the physical-chemical quality of its water. However, the study of the eutrophication process in surface waters faces two main difficulties, which are inherent in the very nature of the system and the phenomena under study: 1. Since aquatic systems naturally differ one from the other, it is obviously difficult if not impossible to establish a reference state to determine the trophic level of a water with absolute accuracy. 2. The second difficulty lies in the choice that must be made among the analytical parameters, to select those that are the most appropriate to describe the phenomenon. Although it is currently admitted that the nitrogen, phosphorus and phytoplankton parameters, among others, cannot be ignored, their intrinsic values are not sufficient to completely describe the process of eutrophication. Indeed, the values of most of these parameters are linked both to the causes and the effects of eutrophication, and as a consequence they cannot be interpreted unambiguously. The same restriction applies to correlations that are established between these parameters and the plant biomass. Because of the originality of the lake system with which we are dealing, the present study offers the opportunity to better understand the reasons for both these problems. The ten lakes we have studied (number 1 to 10) present the rare advantage of being supplied by the same streams, running across a restricted geographical zone that is geologically and climatically similar. However, the trophic characteristics of these waters have been altered by their passage through different agricultural and urban zones. Thus, lakes 1 to 4 are located in an area of low urban density and are colonised by phytoplankton, the density of which decreases from Lake 1 to Lake 4; macrophytes are not present in these lakes. Lake 5, located in the centre of the town, receives domestic waste water. This lake was, over a long period of time, entirely covered with water hyacinths (Eichhornia crassipes), very invasive floating macrophytes, and with lotuses (Nelumbo nucifera) and rooted macrophytes. During the study period, following the manual removal of the macrophytes in July 1995, the water was strongly colonised by algae, as can be seen from the high concentration of chlorophyll-a, close to 200 µg/l. Lake 6 presents a similar situation; it was almost entirely covered by Eichhornia crassipes until July 1997, and was then manually cleared. As the elimination of the water hyacinths profoundly modified the characteristics of this lake, we will show the two periods of time separately. Lake 7 receives the waste water from a densely populated area. After being cleared in July 1997 of a thick layer of various plants that had covered it for several years, the lake was invaded by water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes), a floating macrophyte, which has dominated the lake since December 1997. Finally lakes 9 and 10 are almost completely covered by lotuses (Nelubo nucifera), which are rooted macrophytes, along with a few Pistia stratiotes, while Lake 8 is periodically colonised by water lilies (Nymphea lotus) and algae. To follow changes in the water quality of the 10 lakes studied, 21 sampling stations were chosen, usually at the entrance and exit of each lake. The mean values for the physical-chemical parameters for any lake gave a reasonable representation of the lake water under study. Sample collection in the ten lakes lasted two hours (between 8 and 10 a. m.). The sample collection, and the analysis of the 19 physical-chemical parameters taken into account, was carried out between April 1996 and April 1998 (twice a month in the rainy season and once a month otherwise), which represented about 15 000 measurements. At each location, a litre of water was taken, 50 cm below the surface, with a polyethylene bottle fixed on a 5 m bamboo pole. Portions of 250 ml were then transferred into a brown glass bottle, for later analysis of chlorophyll. After the in-situ analyses, the bottles were kept in the dark in a cooler. Because of the unique sampling situation, it might have been anticipated that the comparison of the different trophic states on the basis of the physical-chemical variables would be possible, but this was not the case. On the contrary, this study tended to show that the physical-chemical characteristics of these waters are as much influenced by the feedback effect of eutrophication as by the external factors, so that the contribution of each of the variables to the various types of eutrophication cannot be clearly determined. This is particularly true in the case of parameters characteristic of nutrients or those reflecting the water response. Although it may appear trivial, this "feedback action" can naturally be generalised to all lake systems, in temperate or tropical climates, whatever the kind of biomass that colonises them. The trophic level of these waters must therefore be evaluated on the basis of new criteria, which will take into account all the relations that link the various parameters...|$|R

Les résultats montrent qu'il y a une évolution saisonnière et cyclique du <b>phosphore</b> dans les bassins de lagunage, en étroite corrélation avec le phytoplancton et le zooplancton. Le phytoplancton représente la part importante des formes organiques du <b>phosphore</b> particulaire. Les meilleures performances d'élimination du <b>phosphore</b> sont notées au printemps (77 % pour les PO 4 et 64 % pour le <b>phosphore</b> total).

Assimilation, sedimentation {{and release}} {{are the principal}} mechanisms controlling the behavior of phosphorus in aquatic ecosystems. There are numerous investigations of the phosphorus cycle in lakes and rivers in relation to the eutrophication process. There are, however, few studies about phosphorus cycling in waste stabilization ponds and most of these have discussed phosphorus removal. The aims of this paper were: 1) to study phosphorus dynamics in relation to the biomass compartment (zooplancton, phytoplancton and bacteria); and 2) to evaluate the phosphorus removal efficiency of the treatment plant under arid climatic conditions. Of particular interest was the remobilization of phosphorus from the pond sediment, both under laboratory conditions and in the field. The experimental installation consisted of two ponds receiving domestic wastewater (mean flow= 120. 4 + 5. 8 m 3. day- 1 and specific organic load= 56 kgBOD. ha- 1. day- 1; pond area= 0. 5 ha and depth= 1. 5 m). Samples were taken twice monthly from the surface, B 1 (S) and B 2 (S), and from the 1. 5 m layers, B 1 (F) and B 2 (F). Composite (24 h) samples were taken from the inflow and the outflowof the plant to determine the removal efficiencies. In each sample, soluble reactive phosphorus (PO 4), total phosphorus (PT) and total soluble phosphorus (PTD) were determined. Particulate phosphorus (PTP) was calculated as (PT-PTD) and soluble organic phosphorus (POD) as (PTD-PO 4). Phosphorus release was measured in a plexiglas flask containing sediment (collected by corer from the pond bottom) overlaid with distilled water. Over 15 days, daily measurements were made of PO 4 and total phosphorus. Sediment dry weight (%), volatile matter, organic carbon (%) and total phosphorus were measured before and after each test. Phosphorus contents of the phytoplankton, zooplankton and bacteria were estimated using the methods of BOUGIS (1974). The results show that cyclical and seasonal variations of phosphorus content were closely correlated with variations in the biological components. Significant correlation coefficients were noted between chlorophyll-a and particulate organic phosphorus. Organic phosphorus in algal cells was the more important form of particulate organic phosphorus. Under the arid climate, the waste stabilization ponds were more efficient at phosphate removal during the spring-summer period (77 % of PO 4 and 64 % of total phosphorus in spring). The first pond may play the major role in phosphate removal. Phosphorus is only eliminated from stabilization ponds through accumulation in the sediment. However, part of the phosphorus which accumulates in pond sediments remains potentially mobile. During the summer period, phosphorus release from the sediment, observed in situ, was favored by stratification of the overlying water. The same phenomenon was noted during the autumn, particularly the release of POD. Laboratory studies have shown that phosphorus release may amount to 55 mg P m- 2 d- 1. Biological activity may {{play a significant role in}} this mobilization...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{freshwater}} eutrophication {{have shown that}} algal biomass tends to increase with the supply of dissolved phosphorus. This concept has been condensed into empirical relationships between chlorophyll a and total phosphorus concentrations (convenient measures of algal biomass and phosphorus availability) which have become essential tools in theoretical and applied limnology. With few exceptions, ecologists accept the idea that chlorophyll concentration rises linearly with phosphorus concentration among lakes. Such a suggestion runs counter to Liebigian principles of fertilization however, and contradicts laboratory and field research indicating the influence of other nutrients. Our analysis of two large independent phosphorus-chlorophyll data sets from temperate-zone lakes shows that log phosphorus-log chlorophyll relationships are sigmoid in shape and that a second nutrient, nitrogen, has {{a significant impact on}} chlorophyll concentrations when phosphorus availability is high.

40|$|Le présent travail porte sur l'évaluation des différentes formes de <b>phosphore,</b> dans les sédiments d'un réservoir eutrophe en climat méditerranéen (El Kansera, Maroc) et la détermination des {{relations}} entre ces formes. L'application d'un schéma de fractionnement chimique du <b>phosphore</b> a permis de déterminer les proportions de quatre formes différentes : le <b>phosphore</b> lié au fer Fe(OOH) -P, le <b>phosphore</b> lié au calcium CaCO 3 -P, le <b>phosphore</b> organique soluble dans l'acide POSA et le <b>phosphore</b> organique résiduel POR. La forme biodisponible a été déterminée par ailleurs, par des bioessais en utilisant une Chlorophycée (Scenedesmus crassus) isolée à partir des eaux de la retenue du barrage étudié. Une étude par analyse factorielle des correspondances a mis en évidence l'influence de {{la nature}} des sédiments étudiés et de leurs propriétés physico-chimiques sur la répartition des formes du <b>phosphore</b> dans les sédiments. En période de basses eaux, les sédiments sont caractérisés par la prédominance des formes inorganiques; alors qu'en période de hautes eaux, la forme POSA est la plus abondante. La confrontation des résultats obtenus par la méthode des bioessais avec ceux relatifs aux extractions chimiques séquentielles de <b>phosphore</b> a montré par ailleurs, que la forme biodisponible du <b>phosphore</b> est fortement corrélée aux formes inorganiques {Fe(OOH) -P et CaCO 3 -P} et indépendante vis à vis des formes organiques {POSA et POR}. We have studied {{in this work}} the different forms of phosphorus in the sediments of a eutrophic reservoir in a Mediterranean climate (El Kansera – Morocco). The studied sediments have been collected at eight sampling stations located {{at different points in}} the middle of the lake during two sampling sessions in contrasting weather conditions: the first sampling occurred in November 1992, a period of autumn mixing and low water levels, whereas the second took place in January 1994 during a high water level period, just after the first winter floods of the Beht river whose waters are retained in the studied reservoir. The evaluation of the different forms of phosphorus was carried out using both a chemical extraction method and a bioassay method. The application of the chosen chemical extraction scheme allowed the determination of the proportions of four different phosphorus forms: iron-bound {Fe(OOH) -P}, calcium-bound {CaCO 3 -P}, acid-soluble organic {POSA} and residual organic {POR}. The bioavailable form {Pbio}, representing less than 32 % of the total sediment phosphorus content, has been evaluated using a Scenedesmus crassus algal strain isolated from El Kansera reservoir waters. According to the results of our analyses, the concentrations of iron-bound phosphorus are higher overall than those of calcium-bound phosphorus. The sediments collected during the low water period contain spatially stable values of POSA (0. 03 – 0. 09 mg. g- 1). These values are lower than those determined in the sediments collected during the high water period (0. 24 – 0. 42 mg. g- 1). This form represents less than 11 % of the total phosphorus in the low water period whereas it represents more than 25 % and up to 56 % of the total phosphorus in the filling period. This result can be explained by the freshness of the organic matter supplied by the continuous water flow in the high water period and the degradation of this organic matter during the low water period. Moreover, the anaerobic conditions of the hypolimnetic layers and the low external supply during the low water period favour organic phosphorus mineralisation. A Factorial Correspondence analysis study has shown the influence of the nature and the physico-chemical properties of the studied sediments on the distribution of the different phosphorus forms. In the low level period, the predominance of the inorganic forms is obvious while POSA is the most abundant form in the period of rising water levels. This differentiation can be explained by the different transport dynamics of suspended organic or inorganic particles according to the water level and also to the external or internal supply of the organic matter. We have also determined the statistical relations among the estimated different forms of phosphorus in El Kansera reservoir sediments. This statistical analysis was carried out to establish the correlation between the bioavailable phosphorus determined by the bioassay method and the phosphorus forms determined by chemical speciation. The goal of the study was to determine, according to statistically significant correlations, the chemical forms of the bioavailable phosphorus contained in the studied sediments. The comparison between the results we have obtained by the bioassay method and those obtained by sequential chemical extraction has shown that the bioavailable form of phosphorus is strongly correlated with the inorganic forms {Fe(OOH) -P} and {CaCO 3 -P}. The high correlation found between the iron-bound form of phosphorus and the bioavailable one is in good agreement with previous work described in the literature that has shown that an important part of the iron-bound and aluminium- bound phosphorus is bioavailable, whatever the extraction method may be. It has also been demonstrated that the forms {Pbio}, {Fe(OOH) -P}, {CaCO 3 -P} and {Pinorg}are notably independent from the {POSA} and {Porg} forms, the correlation coefficients being relatively low.

Avec le peuplement autochtone, par enrichissement en azote et en <b>phosphore</b> de l'eau filtrée sur 200 µm. 2. Avec deux algues tests épuisées en azote et en <b>phosphore,</b> sur l'eau filtrée stérilement. Les quotas cellulaires des algues tests en fin de croissance sont comparés aux quotas cellulaires minimaux et maximaux préalablement établis. Les bioessais avec enrichissement révèlent une limitation de {{la croissance}} des algues par l'azote. Les bioessais avec Fragilaria elliptica présentent une relation linéaire croissante simple entre la concentration en azote assimilée par l'algue test et la densité cellulaire du peuplement phytoplanctonique naturel. L'azote total en solution représente la fraction utilisée par ces algues : azote biodisponible. Par contre, la fraction « phosphore soluble » ne représente qu'une partie du <b>phosphore</b> biodisponible, et se trouve consommée de manière très diverses par les algues testées. Cependant, l'analyse des quotas cellulaires en fin de croissance des algues tests montre que le <b>phosphore</b> est l'élément impliqué dans la limitation de leur croissance. Les bioessais exposent des résultats contradictoires de limitation de la croissance. Les algues autochtones utilisent des ressources en <b>phosphore</b> supérieures à celles qui sont mises à disposition des algues tests, par stockage interne ou par consommation du <b>phosphore</b> minéral adsorbé sur les particules en suspension. In estuarine water, {{the knowledge of}} the resources bioavailability is indispensable for understanding phytoplankton dynamics. For assessing nitrogen and phosphorus bioavailability, algal bioassays are the most indicated. Nutrient limitations of an alga exhibit a threshold rather than an additive or a multiplicative response (ELRIFI et al., 1985). In contrast, numerous nutrient limitations are described for an algal population (TILMAN, 1982). Samples are taken monthly at 1 meter’s depth from two French river estuaries, Noyalo River and Vannes River, in the Morbihan Gulf from April to July. Main physico-chemical measures (temperature, salinity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, total nitrogen, reactive phosphorus and total phosphorus) were taken. Total soluble nitrogen and total soluble phosphorus concentrations were determined after filtration en 0, 2 µm, for comparison with bioassays. In addition two kinds of batch bioassays with 250 ml erlenmeyers into controlled environment (17 °C and 180 ~ 200 µEinstein), were employed :- Estuarine waters filtered on 200 µm, to remove most of the zooplankton, were enriched with sodium nitrate and/or dipotassium hydrogen phosphate. Algal Growth response, was recorded by fluorescence « in vivo », against a blank. - With the total growth on sterilely filtered (0, 2 µm) estuarine waters of two test algae, starved simultaneously in phosphorus and nitrogen in artificial sea water, it was possible to determine the bioavailability of these two elements in the soluble traction. The cellular density of the two test algae : Fragilaria elliptica Schumann and Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin, was related to optical density measures at 750 nm. Nitrogen and phosphorus intracellular concentrations, in the whole culture {{at the end of the}} growth, gave their bio-availability for the test algae provided. Nitrogen and phosphorus cell quotas, intracellular concentration per cell, were then compared with their higher and lower cell quotas. Higher and lower cell quotas were measured at the end of the test algae growth in an artificial medium without phosphorus or nitrogen resources. They were similar to those described by DAUTA (1982). In 1989, an exceptional drought reduced the river flow. Consequently, nutrient flux decreased and phytoplankton density, mainly diatoms, was reduced to between 100 and 800 cells/ml. Sea water dominated in the Morbihan Gulf with salinities higher Chan 30 %o. First, waters filtered on 200 µm and added to which was nitrate and/or phosphate revealed a nitrogen limitation of natural phytoplankton. Secondly, phosphorus limitation were found in bioassays on sterilely filtered waters, in all the test algae starved for phosphorus and nitrogen. At the end of the growth in bioassays, phosphorus cell quotas of the test algae were generaly similar to the lower ones. The growth of the tests algae was limited by that resource. These contrary results are related to the intracellular storage by the natural phytoplankton and/or the major role of particulate fractions in phosphorus bioavailability. Phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations assimilated by the test alga : Fragilaria elliptica, were inversely related. From May to July 1989 the results showed a simple linear relation between soluble nitrogen source (filtered on 0. 2 µm) which was bioavailable for the test alga and natural phytoplankton density (R 2 = 0. 98). The two measurements of April did not agree with the latter relation, rather because of environmental factors such as temperature (11 °C against 20 ~ 21 °C for the next ones), than because of the resources. Moreover, the station B in July exhibited a natural phytoplankton density significantly lower than the station A and independent of the nitrogen bioavailability for the two test algae. The bioavailable phosphorus for Phaeodactylum tricornutum, was also significantly lower at station B. That resource can explain the difference in density monitored in July. The total soluble nitrogen source, inorganic and organic, and just a fraction of the total soluble phosphorus source, were assimilated. The soluble phosphorus assimilated by test algae, after sterile filtration, is not the total bioavailable phosphorus in the water of the Morbihan Gulf and seems to be inversely related to the natural phytoplancton density. A part from mineral phosphorus adsorbed on suspended matter is also bioavailable (BERLAND et al., 1973). However, for the phosphorus resource, bioassays have to be performed on particulate fractions...|$|E
