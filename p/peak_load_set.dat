50|$|One {{advantage}} of a smart grid application is time-based pricing. Customers who traditionally pay a fixed rate for consumed energy (kWh) and requested <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> can <b>set</b> their threshold and adjust their usage to take {{advantage of}} fluctuating prices. This may require the use of an energy management system to control appliances and equipment and can involve economies of scale. Another advantage, mainly for large customers with generation, is being able to closely monitor, shift, and balance load in a way that allows the customer to save <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> and not only save on kWh and kW/month but be able to trade what they have saved in an energy market. Again this involves sophisticated energy management systems, incentives, and a viable trading market.|$|R

During the test, the impact wear test used a force control mode. The impact force could be changed by adjusting the magnitude of the current. When the tube was impacted by the plate, the impact contact force can be measured by the load sensor. The impact block was raised when the peak force was reached. Two types of lubrication conditions, namely, dry and water(deionized water), were obtained at room temperature. A frequency of 5  Hz of the 1  mm impact distance and 106 cycles were selected in all the tests, and the applied normal <b>peak</b> <b>loads</b> were <b>set</b> as 20  N, 30  N, 40  N, 45  N, and 50  N.

40|$|Abstract—The Ontario {{electrical}} grid is sized to meet <b>peak</b> electricity <b>load.</b> A reduction in <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> would allow deferring large infrastructural costs of additional power plants, thereby lowering generation cost and electricity prices. Proposed solutions for <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> reduction include demand response and storage.

40|$|Current energy {{distribution}} networks {{are often not}} equipped for facilitating expected sustainable transitions. Major concerns for future electricity networks are the possibility of <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> increases and the expected growth of decentralized energy generation. In this article, we focus on <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> increases; the effects of possible future developments on <b>peak</b> <b>loads</b> are studied, together with the consequences for the network. The city of Eindhoven (the Netherlands) is used as reference city, for which a scenario is developed in which the assumed future developments adversely influence the maximum <b>peak</b> <b>loads</b> on the network. In this scenario, the total electricity <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> in Eindhoven {{is expected to increase}} from 198 MVA in 2009 to 591 - 633 MVA in 2040. The necessary investments for facilitating the expected increased <b>peak</b> <b>loads</b> are estimated at 305 - 375 million Euros. Based upon these projections, it is advocated that - contrary to current Dutch policy - choices regarding sustainable transitions should be made from the viewpoint of integral energy systems, evaluating economic implications of changes to generation, grid development, and consumption. Recently applied and finished policies on energy demand reduction showed to be effective; however, additional and connecting policies on energy generation and distribution should be considered on short term.

It is observed that the <b>peak</b> <b>load</b> and energy absorption of the expansion tube is influenced by expansion ratio (rp/ro), punch angle followed by tube temperature.
