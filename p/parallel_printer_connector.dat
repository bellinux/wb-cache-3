50|$|Usually device programmers are {{connected}} to a personal computer through a <b>printer</b> <b>connector,</b> USB port or LAN interface. A software program on the computer then transfers the data to the programmer, selects the device and interface type, and starts the programming process to read/ write/ erase/ blank the data inside the device.|$|R
50|$|The Printer Interface was an S-100 Bus card {{giving the}} Super-80 a Centronics <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> port.|$|R
50|$|The early Tandy 1000's used a {{non-standard}} card-edge <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> port {{rather than}} industry standard DB-25 printer port. It required a Tandy-1000 compatible printer cable {{to connect to}} a standard <b>printer</b> <b>parallel</b> port.|$|R

50|$|For consumers, USB and {{computer}} networks {{have replaced the}} <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> port, for connections both to printers and to other devices.|$|R
50|$|The {{follow-up}} Super Gold Card had a 24 MHz 68020 CPU, 4MB of RAM, {{and added}} a Centronics <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> interface.|$|R
5000|$|The Didaktik Kompakt from 1992 was {{basically}} a Didaktik M with built-in floppy 3.5" [...] 720 KB drive and <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> port.|$|R
50|$|Like the IBM Monochrome Display Adapter it {{improved}} on, the Hercules Graphics Card {{had both}} a <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> port {{and a video}} output port.|$|R
50|$|The {{calculator}} had a BASIC interpreter, MEMO function, {{a formula}} library. The built-in 8 kB memory could be expanded using the optional Casio RP-8 (8 kB) or RP-33 (32 kB) RAM expansion modules. An optional Casio FA-6 interface board provided a cassette tape recorder <b>connector,</b> a Centronics <b>printer</b> <b>connector</b> and an RS-232C port. The calculator could print data and listings on any Centronics printer; printing graphics required the Casio FP-100 plotter-printer.|$|R

50|$|The newer EPPs (Enhanced Parallel Ports) have an 8-bit data bus, and {{the same}} control pins as the normal <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> port. Newer ports reach speeds of up to 2 MB/s.|$|R
5000|$|Interface cables were {{available}} for the common serial (RS-232) and <b>parallel</b> (<b>printer)</b> ports of the day. These use a [...] "smart" [...] cable connected to a single IÂ²C bus on the AgendA.|$|R
50|$|Published in late 1985, {{this version}} {{corrected}} {{a problem with}} <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> cards present in 2.0 and changed printed characters from low-ASCII to high-ASCII, correcting an issue with certain interface cards and printers.|$|R
5000|$|IBM's {{original}} MDA {{includes a}} <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> port (hence its original name of [...] "Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter"), thus avoiding {{the need for}} a separate parallel interface on computers fitted with an MDA.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{software}} {{written for}} the Spectrum ran on the TK90X, with some minor incompatibilities. Only three peripherals were released by Microdigital [...] - [...] a Joystick, a light pen interface and a <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> interface.|$|R

5000|$|Early SCSI {{interfaces}} {{commonly used}} a 50-pin micro ribbon connector. This connector {{is similar to}} the 36-pin connector used by Centronics for the parallel interface on their <b>printers,</b> thus the <b>connector</b> became popularly known as [...] "Centronics SCSI" [...] or [...] "CN-50". It is also referred to as a [...] "SCSI-1 connector"; since many connectors have been used for SCSI-1, this can be confusing.Apple used DB-25 connectors, which, having only 25 pins rather than 50, were less expensive to make, but compromised functionality. Further, DB-25s were commonly used for RS-232 serial cables and also to connect <b>parallel</b> <b>printers,</b> meaning that users might accidentally try to use completely inappropriate cables, since the printer and serial cables would fit the connector properly and be hard to visually distinguish. The DB-25's only advantage was that it was smaller than a CN50.|$|R
40|$|IBM PCs with <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> ports {{are widely}} {{available}} in teaching and research laboratories. This paper describes a novel system for controlling any equipment in general, positioning with stepping motors in particular via the <b>parallel</b> Centronics <b>printer</b> port of an IBM PC or compatible. Techniques are presented for exploring the unused parallel port or exploiting the Centronics printer port for control. Programs are developed for position control of stepper motor using Macro Assembler MASM 86. 1...|$|R
50|$|<b>Parallel</b> port <b>printers</b> {{have been}} slowly phased out, {{and are now}} {{difficult}} to find for the most part, being considered as an obsolete legacy port on most new computers. Those who have printers and scanners with only parallel port may {{still be able to}} connect the devices via the use of USB adapters a.k.a. Parallel-to-USB cable, or use a PCI <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> port card. Generally, FireWire's very high speeds of up to 800 Mbit/s are excessive for printers.|$|R
50|$|The older <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> ports had an 8-bit {{data bus}} and four pins for control output (Strobe, Linefeed, Initialize, and Select In), and five more for control input (ACK, Busy, Select, Error, and Paper Out). Its data {{transfer}} speed is at 150 kbit/s.|$|R
50|$|The Dragon has {{additional}} circuitry to {{make the}} MC6847 VDG compatible with European 625-line television standards, rather than the US 525-line NTSC standard, and a Centronics <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> port not present on the TRS-80. Some models were manufactured with NTSC video for the US market.|$|R
50|$|The D620 and D630 share {{a common}} form factor, battery socket, {{and do not have}} a <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> port. Both have support for an {{optional}} internal Bluetooth module, a socket for an optional mobile broadband card, and have an external switch for disabling any wireless connections.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, {{this design}} was updated for the AMD Geode LX700-based DBE61 model, with USB 2.0 {{provided}} by a CS5536 companion chip. The <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> port was then removed, returning the design to an all-USB configuration. Linutop SARL retained this model {{as a starting point}} for their Linutop-1 product.|$|R
5000|$|There were severe {{shortcomings}} of early Commodore printers, so CARDCO created the Card Print A (C/?A) printer interface that emulated Commodore printers by converting the Commodore serial interface to a Centronics <b>parallel</b> <b>printer</b> interface to allow numerous 3rd-party printers {{to be connected}} to a Commodore 64 or VIC-20.|$|R
