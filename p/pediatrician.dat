40|$|Health {{care costs}} and {{government}} cutbacks in Canadian training posts have caused concerns about physician manpower. To determine the present pediatric manpower situation a cross-country survey was undertaken of all <b>pediatricians</b> and their practice patterns. Of the 2060 recipients of a questionnaire 5 % {{were found to}} not be <b>pediatricians.</b> Of the remaining 1960, 69 % returned a completed questionnaire. Overall, 70 % of the <b>pediatricians</b> were men, although among those less than 35 years of age 49 % were women. Across Canada 37 % of the <b>pediatricians</b> practised primary care, 25 % secondary care and 38 % tertiary care. There were wide regional differences in practice patterns, {{with large numbers of}} primary care <b>pediatricians</b> in Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa and the province of Quebec; few <b>pediatricians</b> in the Maritimes and the remainder of western Canada practised primary care. Non-Canadian graduates accounted for 33 % of the <b>pediatricians</b> and represented a considerable proportion of tertiary care <b>pediatricians.</b> Cutbacks in numbers of pediatric training positions and restrictions on immigration of foreign <b>pediatricians</b> may lead to unexpected deficiencies in the availability of some types of pediatric practitioners, especially those in tertiary care...|$|R

5|$|In 2015, Asperger's was {{estimated}} to affect 37.2 million people globally. The syndrome is named after the Austrian <b>pediatrician</b> Hans Asperger who, in 1944, described children in his practice who lacked nonverbal communication, had limited understanding of others' feelings, and were physically clumsy. The modern conception of Asperger syndrome came into existence in 1981 and went {{through a period of}} popularization. It became a standardized diagnosis in the early 1990s. Many questions and controversies remain about aspects of the disorder. There is doubt about whether it is distinct from high-functioning autism (HFA). Partly because of this, the percentage of people affected is not firmly established.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pediatricians</b> play a {{key role}} in the healthy {{development}} of children. Nevertheless, the practice patterns of <b>pediatricians</b> have seldom been investigated.

40|$|Background: <b>Pediatricians</b> {{and other}} health-care {{providers}} could play an invaluable role in ensuring {{the maintenance of}} optimal preventive as well as curative dental health in children. This study was aimed at assessing the pediatrician's perspective on basic oral health care in children in Kanchipuram district. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire survey was carried out among <b>Pediatricians</b> which covered various aspects of knowledge, attitude, and role of <b>pediatricians</b> in preventive dental care. The collected data were tabulated, and percent frequency distributions for responses to every question were assessed. Results: None of the participants reported that <b>pediatricians</b> are responsible for infant oral health presumes that <b>pediatricians</b> are not examining the oral cavity {{as a part of}} routine. All of the <b>pediatricians</b> gave nutritional counseling to the parents but only 7 % of them of caries. All the <b>pediatricians</b> liked the concept of an association between lack of knowledge among <b>pediatricians</b> and pediatric dentist and establishment of a dental home along with a medical home. Conclusion: From the present study, we conclude that {{there is a lack of}} awareness about prevention of dental caries among <b>pediatricians</b> in Kanchipuram district. To overcome this, advocating dentists as part of well-child care and establishing dental home along with medical home. Publishing pediatric journals concerning about the oral health to improve the knowledge is also essential in promoting good oral health hygiene...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{practice}} patterns of female <b>pediatricians</b> in Quebec {{with those of}} their male counterparts and to identify specific factors influencing these practice patterns. DESIGN: Matched cohort questionnaire survey. SETTING: Primary, secondary and tertiary care pediatric practices in Quebec. PARTICIPANTS: All 146 female <b>pediatricians</b> and 133 of the 298 male <b>pediatricians,</b> matched for age as well as type and site of practice; 119 (82 %) of the female and 115 (86 %) of the male <b>pediatricians</b> responded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic and family data as well as detailed information about the practice profile. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable regarding demographic data, professional work and patient care. Compared with the male respondents, the female <b>pediatricians</b> were younger and saw more outpatients. The mean number of hours worked per week, excluding on-call duty, was 40. 5 (standard deviation [SD] 12. 4) for the women and 48. 9 (SD 12. 0) for the men (p < 0. 001). The female <b>pediatricians</b> {{were more likely than}} their male counterparts to have spouses who were also physicians (40 %) or in another profession (45 %). The female <b>pediatricians</b> without children worked significantly fewer hours than the male <b>pediatricians</b> with or without children (p < 0. 001). Children (p = 0. 006), but not the number of children (p = 0. 452), had a significant effect on the number of hours worked by the female <b>pediatricians.</b> CONCLUSION: The duality of the role of female physicians as mothers and professional caregivers must be considered during workload evaluations. If the same style of practice and the increase in the proportion of female <b>pediatricians</b> continue, about 20 % more <b>pediatricians</b> will be needed in 10 years to accomplish the same workload...|$|R
5|$|The {{disease is}} named after Eduard Heinrich Henoch (1820–1910), a German <b>pediatrician</b> (nephew of Moritz Heinrich Romberg) and his teacher Johann Lukas Schönlein (1793–1864), who {{described}} it in the 1860s. Schönlein associated the purpura and arthritis, and Henoch the purpura and gastrointestinal involvement. The English physician William Heberden (1710–1801) and the dermatologist Robert Willan (1757–1812) had already described the disease in 1802 and 1808, respectively, but the name Heberden–Willan disease has fallen into disuse.

Half of the <b>pediatricians</b> {{in private practice}} and 35 % of family physicians in private practice accepted all children who were Medicaid beneficiaries into their practice; 42 % of <b>pediatricians</b> and 50 % of family physicians accepted all non-Medicaid patients but only some new Medicaid patients; and 8 % of <b>pediatricians</b> and 15 % of family physicians accepted new non-Medicaid patients but no Medicaid patients. Practice location {{was associated with the}} level of Medicaid participation for these primary care physicians: Significantly more rural <b>pediatricians</b> and family physicians than those with urban practices accepted Medicaid patients. The average reimbursement level for these physicians was shown to be an important determinant of whether physicians would accept Medicaid patients. Nonparticipatory physicians were more concerned about excessive paperwork compared with physicians with limited participation. Among physicians with limited participation, family physicians and <b>pediatricians</b> both cited problems of excessive paperwork, reimbursement delays, and retroactive denials of payment as important deterrents to accepting Medicaid patients...|$|R
5|$|At the wedding, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{arrives with}} her husband Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), where Ryan Howard (B. J.

Jim tells Dwight that under Schrute tradition, he {{is not allowed to}} be best man as he is younger than him. Jim surprises him with the arrival of Michael Scott (Steve Carell). The wedding proceeds in Schrute tradition with Michael as Dwight's new best man. At the reception, Michael shows Pam pictures of his kids with Holly Flax, and Pam notes that he is paying for two phones just to hold all the images. Ryan deliberately gives Drake an allergic reaction so that Ravi, a <b>pediatrician,</b> can attend and Ryan can steal Kelly away. Kevin tells Ravi that Ryan wanted him to keep Drake so that Ryan can have Kelly and the two can start a new life together. Ravi then gives Kevin the baby to give to Child Services before leaving, but Nellie, who has still been wanting a child, takes Drake instead.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{is forced}} to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, CeCe's <b>pediatrician,</b> in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several {{attempts}} to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can not even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be with anyone else if she {{is not going to be}} with him. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{timing of}} {{complementary}} food introduction is controversial. Providing {{information on the}} timing of dietary introduction {{is crucial to the}} primary prevention of food allergy. The American Academy of Pediatrics offers dietary recommendations that were updated in 2008. Objective Identify the recommendations that general <b>pediatricians</b> and registered dietitians provide to parents and delineate any differences in counselling. Methods A 9 -item survey was distributed to <b>pediatricians</b> and dietitians online and by mail. Information on practitioner type, gender, length of practice and specific recommendations regarding complementary food introduction and exposure was collected. Results 181 surveys were returned with a 54 % response rate from <b>pediatricians.</b> It was not possible to calculate a meaningful dietitian response rate due to overlapping email databases. 52. 5 % of all respondents were <b>pediatricians</b> and 45. 9 % were dietitians. The majority of <b>pediatricians</b> and dietitians advise mothers that peanut abstinence during pregnancy and lactation is unnecessary. Dietitians were more likely to counsel mothers to breastfeed their infants to prevent development of atopic dermatitis than <b>pediatricians.</b> Hydrolyzed formulas for infants at risk of developing allergy were the top choice of formula amongst both practitioners. For food allergy prevention, <b>pediatricians</b> were more likely to recommend delayed introduction of peanut and egg, while most dietitians recommended no delay in allergenic food introduction. Conclusions In the prophylaxis of food allergy, <b>pediatricians</b> are less aware than dietitians of the current recommendation that there is no benefit in delaying allergenic food introduction beyond 4 to 6 months. More dietitians than <b>pediatricians</b> believe that breastfeeding decreases the risk of atopic dermatitis. Practitioners may benefit from increased awareness of current guidelines. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{mortality}} rate {{of children is}} one of the most important indicators to measuring the development of countries. Equitable access to <b>pediatricians</b> is an important factor in reducing child mortality and promoting society health. The aim of this tudy was to investiget the Inequality and trend of geographic accessibility to <b>Pediatricians</b> in Iran in the period 2007 to 2013. Materials and Methods: We used the Gini coefficient and the index of dissimilarity for investigating the geographic distribution of <b>pediatricians</b> in the period 2007 to 2013 in Iran. Also, a regression model used for detrminig time trend of inequality. Data about the number of <b>pediatricians</b> and number of live birth in each province were obtained from the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI). Results: The Gini coefficient was 0. 27, 0. 24, 0. 26, 0. 23, 0. 23, 0. 23, 0. 25 and 0. 21 in 2007 to 2013, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Choosing {{career paths}} can be {{difficult}} decisions for residents contemplating fellowship training. This study compares the experiences of early career <b>pediatricians</b> who did and did not pursue fellowships. METHODS: We analyzed national, weighted data from <b>pediatricians</b> 8 to 10 years after residency (n = 842). Work environment, work–life balance, and satisfaction were compared for <b>pediatricians</b> who had pursued fellowship training (fellowship trained) {{and those who did}} not pursue fellowship training (generalist trained). Logistic and linear regression examined the independent effects of fellowship training while controlling for demographic differences. RESULTS: A total of 39 % of the <b>pediatricians</b> (328 / 842) pursued fellowship training. The fellowship-trained group was less likely than the generalist-trained group to spend time in direct patient care and more likely to report learning opportunities in their work environment.
