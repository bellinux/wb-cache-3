Boorman then drove in an old 1953 classic Holden which was a popular family car in Australia in the 1950s to Quorn where he tested out a solar car which {{had been used in}} the World Solar Car Challenge. Near Woolshed Flat, he and Russ rode in a steam train, and then resumed in the <b>pick-up</b> <b>van.</b> On the way to the Snowy Mountains, they stopped at a garage where one of the owners was a specialist steel carver who had made many 3D-looking figures out of steel. Russ purchased a large steel carving of a biker who was renowned in Australia in the 1950s {{and put it on the}} back of the <b>pick-up</b> <b>van</b> and resumed. In the Snowy Mountains, Boorman went horse riding, before driving up into the peaks via a Ski Tube and then a snowmobile at the top. After descending, they resumed the journey to Wollongong, on the coast where they caught up with their families. They then met up with a rally of bikers in a fashion that emulated Long Way Round, and Boorman on a BMW motorcycle with gang rode the 76 miles north along the coast to Sydney. There, the journey finished in Sydney Harbour opposite the Sydney Opera House. In total they used 112 modes of transport that took them through 24 countries in 102 days.|$|E

All fleet vehicles were ordered in Bonatti Grey with white roofs (last batch vehicles had grey roofs) and the electrical systems were {{kept to a minimum}} with all luxury items such as electric windows, heated seats, radar detector omitted for simplicity. Vehicles were supplied as a mixture of 12 and 24 volt FFR variants, their powerplants being either the standard Td5 turbodiesel engine, or some 3 Litre BMW units. The contract was cancelled in late 2004 after the German government opted for one with Mercedes Benz who supplied their G-Class [...] "Gelandewagen" [...] in various forms, and a small number of these last batch vehicles were imported and immediately sold-off to the private market.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} tractor-hiring unit of Edo state, Nigeria. The criteria used were fleet of equipment, personnel and workshop facilities {{and its impact on}} the farming populace in the state. The study adopted the use of a questionnaire and interview schedules. Among the information requested from the respondents were access to services rendered by the unit and increment in farm sizes. Records available at the headquarters and zonal offices of the unit provided additional sources of information. The unit has seven Steyr, 18 Fiat and nine Massey Ferguson tractors, eight ploughs, 17 harrows, seven tipping trailers, two boom sprayers, one fertilizer spreader, three maize shellers, two rotary slashers, one drilling machine, two ridgers and a <b>pick-up</b> <b>van</b> which are located in the various zones of the unit. Most of these equipment are either functional or require minor repairs to be used on the field. There is sufficient number of tractors but insufficient implements to fully utilize them. Workshop facilities and personnel are inadequate. The maintenance culture adopted is customer motivated. This is not a good practice as it has resulted in about 12 % of the equipment being abandoned as scraps. There has been a general increase in farmsizes since th...|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{required}} {{data sets}} {{were collected from}} 74 road segments of four Indian cities and were thoroughly analyzed. Influencing variables were identified {{with the help of}} a most recent and most promising machine learning technique, namely random forest. It was also observed that traffic volume followed by width of the outermost lane, roadside commercial activities, on-street parking turnover and pavement condition index, etc., has the highest influence on perceived satisfaction levels of on-street bicyclists. Ordered probit and ordered logit modeling structures were used to develop predictive models which would help transportation engineering professionals while rating urban road segments from a bicyclist’s perspective. Using outputs of these models, necessary actions could be taken for the betterment of bicyclists. Prediction performance of both models was tested using several statistical parameters such as Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and pseudo-R-squares (pseudo-R 2), and it was observed that the probit model has better performance in the present context. In addition to the development of a reliable service prediction model, this study introduces influences of two new parameters such as interruptions by unauthorized stoppages of intermittent public transits (<b>pick-up</b> <b>vans,</b> 3 -wheeler autos, etc.) and frequency of driveways carrying a high volume of traffic which perhaps are not considered in any previous such studies.|$|R
50|$|As soon as {{a vehicle}} is purchased, the dealer of the vehicle issues a {{temporary}} licence sticker known colloquially as a TR (To Register) number. This is valid for one month, during which the owner must register the vehicle in the controlling RTO of {{the area in which}} the owner is residing to get a standard licence plate. Some states like Tamil Nadu do not allow vehicles with TR numbers on the road, the dealer will hand over the vehicle to the purchaser only after the registration process is done. To register a vehicle, it has to be presented to the RTO's office, where a Motor Vehicle Inspector will verify the applicant's address and other details, confirm that the engine and chassis numbers are identical to what is written in the application and issues a permanent registration certificate which is usually valid for 20 years. The permanent registration certificate is one of the four important documents a vehicle plying on the road should always have; the others being a valid insurance certificate, a pollution under control (PUC) certificate and the driver's licence. For public utility vehicles like buses, trucks, taxis and <b>pick-up</b> <b>vans,</b> {{there are a number of}} additional documents like a road-worthiness certificate and a transportation permit.|$|R

40|$|An {{assessment}} of farm transportation system {{to ascertain the}} availability of transportation for the evacuation of farm produce was undertaken in Osun and Oyo states of Nigeria employing printed questionnaires and personal communication as means of information collection. 20 % of the farmers reside at between one and three km from their farms while for the remaining 80 %, it ranges from four to 16 km. 17. 6 % of the farmers travel between one and three km to sell their produce while for the remaining 82. 4 %, the distances range from four to over 16 km. 61. 8 % of the farmers have access to only untarred roads, 9. 1 % to partly untarred/tarred roads and only 29. 1 % get to their farms except for the last stretch through tarred roads. The vehicles found on farm routes in the area surveyed include bicycles, cars, buses, <b>pick-up</b> <b>vans</b> and lorries. 32. 7 % of farmers and 86. 8 % of produce merchants don’t own any form of transport and hence they depend on commercial transport, which could be scarce and expensive. Road conditions are deplorable especially {{during the rainy season}} and this cause further wear and tear on the poor condition vehicles used on the roads and delays in produce delivery.

5000|$|The new HiAce of 1977 {{featured}} a longer, and more streamlined cab with single headlights. As the second generations dimensions grew, it {{was joined by}} a smaller, junior-level cabover van called the Toyota LiteAce to continue to offer dimensions closer to the first generation. In addition to the petrol engine, a 2.2-litre diesel engine was offered in certain markets. New for the [...] "20-40 series" [...] HiAce was a double-cab <b>pick-up,</b> super-long-wheelbase <b>van,</b> and a super long, high-roof Commuter. The Commuter models can seat up to 15 passengers.

50|$|The Ital had revised {{exterior}} styling, but {{retained the}} Marina's 1.3- and 1.7-litre petrol engines and rear-wheel drive chassis. The dashboard and {{interior of the}} Marina were also carried over largely unaltered, including the main fascia panel which faced 'away' from the driver. The Marina's coupé variant was not produced in Ital form, but the four-door saloon, five-door estate and <b>pick-up</b> and <b>van</b> versions were carried over from the Marina range. From October 1980 an automatic version of the Ital was available with the 2.0-litre O-Series power unit, as the range-topping 2.0HLS. Only about 1,000 2.0HLS models were sold so due to this and their short production run, the 2.0HLS is now the rarest Ital model. In November 1981 all HL and HLS models were fitted with upgraded interior trim.|$|R
