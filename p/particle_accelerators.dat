5|$|O'Neill began researching high-energy {{particle}} physics at Princeton in 1954, after {{he received his}} doctorate from Cornell University. Two years later, he published his theory for a particle storage ring. This invention allowed <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> at much higher energies than had previously been possible. In 1965 at Stanford University, he performed the first colliding beam physics experiment.|$|E

5|$|Super-heavy {{elements}} such as seaborgium are produced by bombarding lighter elements in <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> that induces fusion reactions. Whereas most of the isotopes of seaborgium can be synthesized directly this way, some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the {{development}} of improved <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> and particle detectors allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies. Neutrons and protons {{were found to be}} hadrons, or composites of smaller particles called quarks. The standard model of particle physics was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub-atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions.|$|E
5|$|Large <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> can {{replicate}} {{the conditions that}} prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement {{of the details of}} the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into high energy regimes. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.|$|E

5|$|Linear <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> {{generate}} electron beams {{for treatment}} of superficial tumors in radiation therapy. Electron therapy can treat such skin lesions as basal-cell carcinomas because an electron beam only penetrates to a limited depth before being absorbed, typically up to 5cm for electron energies in the range 5–20MeV. An electron beam {{can be used to}} supplement the treatment of areas that have been irradiated by X-rays.|$|E
5|$|A lepton is an elementary, half-integer spin {{particle}} {{that does}} not undergo strong interactions but {{is subject to the}} Pauli exclusion principle; no two leptons of the same species can be in exactly the same state at the same time. Two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as the electron-like leptons), and neutral leptons (better known as neutrinos). Electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the Universe, whereas muons and taus are unstable particle that quickly decay after being produced in high energy collisions, such as those involving cosmic rays or carried out in <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lawrencium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Lr (formerly Lw) and atomic number 103. It is {{named in honor}} of Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron, a device that was used to discover many artificial radioactive elements. A radioactive metal, lawrencium is the eleventh transuranic element and is also the final member of the actinide series. Like all elements with atomic number over 100, lawrencium can only be produced in <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. Twelve isotopes of lawrencium are currently known; the most stable is 266Lr with a half-life of 11hours, but the shorter-lived 260Lr (half-life 2.7minutes) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.|$|E

5|$|Mendelevium is a {{synthetic}} element with chemical symbol Md (formerly Mv) and atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive transuranic {{element in the}} actinide series, {{it is the first}} element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements. It is the third-to-last actinide and the ninth transuranic element. It can only be produced in <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being 258Md with a half-life of 51days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.|$|E
5|$|There are six {{types of}} quarks, known as flavors: up, down, strange, charm, top, and bottom. Up and down quarks {{have the lowest}} masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks {{through a process of}} {{particle}} decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators).</b> For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.|$|E
5|$|Electrons play an {{essential}} role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics, welding, cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators.</b>|$|E

5|$|Elementary fermions {{are grouped}} into three generations, each {{comprising}} two leptons and two quarks. The first generation includes {{up and down}} quarks, the second strange and charm quarks, and the third bottom and top quarks. All searches for a fourth generation of quarks and other elementary fermions have failed, and there is strong indirect evidence that {{no more than three}} generations exist. Particles in higher generations generally have greater mass and less stability, causing them to decay into lower-generation particles by means of weak interactions. Only first-generation (up and down) quarks occur commonly in nature. Heavier quarks can only be created in high-energy collisions (such as in those involving cosmic rays), and decay quickly; however, they are thought to have been present during the first fractions of a second after the Big Bang, when the universe was in an extremely hot and dense phase (the quark epoch). Studies of heavier quarks are conducted in artificially created conditions, such as in <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{universe}} {{continued to}} decrease in density {{and fall in}} temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. Symmetry breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form. After about 10−11 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators.</b> At about 10−6 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 1010 of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons.|$|E
5|$|The Standard Model of {{particle}} physics {{is a theory}} which describes {{three of the four}} known fundamental interactions between the elementary particles that make up all matter. This theory allows predictions to be made about how particles will interact under many conditions. The energy per particle in a supernova is typically one to one hundred and fifty picojoules (tens to hundreds of MeV). The per-particle energy involved in a supernova is small enough that the predictions gained from the Standard Model {{of particle}} physics are likely to be basically correct. But the high densities may require corrections to the Standard Model. In particular, Earth-based <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators</b> can produce particle interactions which are of much higher energy than are found in supernovae, but these experiments involve individual particles interacting with individual particles, and {{it is likely that the}} high densities within the supernova will produce novel effects. The interactions between neutrinos and the other particles in the supernova take place with the weak nuclear force, which is believed to be well understood. However, the interactions between the protons and neutrons involve the strong nuclear force, which is much less well understood.|$|E
