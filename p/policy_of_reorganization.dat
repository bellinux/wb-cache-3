40|$|The New Zealand {{government}} {{recently announced}} a rather far-reaching <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> deregulation and <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> certain governmental entities, including electricity generation and transmission. Electricorp, a state-owned enterprise whose actions {{will be subject}} to a standard of commercial efficiency, has been formed to take over these functions and to sell bulk power at wholesale to localized distribution entities-who then will resell it at retail. Electricorp will be unregulated but subject to antitrust jurisdiction, as will be the distribution entities. Neither Electricorp nor the distributors will have any protected monopoly status. Substantial possibilities exist for competition in both bulk power and retail power markets over the long run, and one has reason to be optimistic that antitrust can deal with the remaining monopoly issues. New Zealand's radical deregulation yields favorable inferences about the outcome of the somewhat slower deregulation of electricity in the United States.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} dynamics <b>of</b> British <b>policy</b> towards the Chinese community in Malaya {{during a period of}} thirteen years which witnessed the Japanese Occupation of Malaya, the reestablishment of British colonial rule, and the efforts towards self government. A key factor in the British policy towards the Chinese community is based on an awareness of the community's potentiality to become a " Fifth Column", threatening the security of British Malaya. The problem facing the colonial authorities, therefore, was how to neutralize this potential "Fifth Column". Influenced by the contemporary situation, the British eventually adopted a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> socio-political <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> the Chinese community as a means of solving the problem. During the period of this study British policy towards the Chinese political role covers four stages: first, the pre-war period with the so-called "pro-Malay policy"; second, the 1942 - 1947 period with the new Chinese policy and the Malayan Union scheme; third, the period of Federation and the revival of a pro-Malay policy; and finally, the Malayanization of the Chinese aiming at building a united Malayan nation. Simultaneously with this stage, was the British undertaking of decolonization. In retrospect, the study in the main confirms the success <b>of</b> British <b>policy</b> towards the Malayan Chinese particularly in cultivating a sense of Malayan national consciousness. At least the majority of the Chinese in Malaya willingly chose this land as their home...|$|R

40|$|In four Maghreb {{countries}} (Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania and Tunisia), {{a considerable}} {{improvement of the}} situation of the telecommunication operators has been noticed during the nineties. The evolution in these countries was very different depending on their economic <b>policies,</b> their effort <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> their telecommunication sector and their technological change. Theses differences will be exhibited and analysed by comparing the operators’ performances over a decade (1992 – 2001). A first approach is based on the Malmquist DEA TFP index for measuring the total factors productivity change, decomposed into technical efficiency change and technological changes. Second, using the Promethee II method and the software ARGOS, a multiple criteria analysis is performed, taking into account a larger scope of analysis. A main issue is that the general performance ranking of sets of operators by country is almost the same according to the two methods, although the variables of inputs and output used for the index of Malmquist are different and narrower in the considered scope than the chosen families of criteria used in method Promethee and software ARGOS. Both methods of analysis provide however complementary useful detailed information, especially in discriminating the technological and management progresses for Malmquist and the two dimensions of performance for Promethee: that are the service to the community and the enterprises performances, often in conflict.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this scientific research is application of the basic model of interaction between phases of a cycle <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> organizational and technological processes underway at industrial enterprises. The authors describe interactions between all six phases of the process <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> {{within the framework of}} the basic model of a cycle that contemplates organizational and technological processes. Engineering studies are necessary to check for the feasibility <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> industrial enterprises and application of results extracted from the design documentation with a view to <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> production activities and construction operations. Upon completion of the decision-making process concerning the need for reorganization in accordance with the basic model of interaction between phases, there occurs restructuring that incorporates processes of design and construction.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this scientific research {{is to develop a}} theoretical model of organizational and technology-related processes <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> industrial enterprises, as well as their interaction. Multipoint logic notions of growth and interaction phases are used as research methods. The author describes the basic stages <b>of</b> <b>reorganization,</b> the life cycle of industrial enterprises and the cycle of their transformation. The processes are presented as an infographical image that represents a concentric model of interaction. This concentric model represents interaction between two or more phases. The process is entitled infografical modeling on the polyfunctional level. The concentric model moves both clockwise and anti-clockwise. Basic organizational and technological processes <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> industrial enterprises that include decision making in terms <b>of</b> expediency <b>of</b> <b>reorganization,</b> design, construction, and performance of industrial enterprises at full capacity, and further operation of the industrial enterprise are described in the paper. Attainment of this objective, namely, <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> an industrial enterprise, involves a huge amount of resources, including labour resources that need interaction with all parties of reorganization; therefore, the concentric model of interaction describing the basic cycle <b>of</b> <b>reorganization,</b> the life cycle of an industrial enterprise and the cycle of its conversion is a trustworthy representation of this process. The proposed concentric model of interaction should be used in the design of organizational and technology-related processes for integrated consideration <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> enterprises required to understand and improve the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>reorganizations</b> and to control the <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> industrial facilities.

40|$|The article {{examines}} problems concerning {{the modernization of}} the higher education in Russia and training of highly intellectual, elite persons for managing the country. The author concludes that the hasty steps taken {{in the course of}} reforming the Russian system of higher education {{at the end of the}} first decade of the 21 st century led to a specific situation. This situation is characterized by a <b>policy</b> <b>of</b> accelerated <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> education, primarily aimed at accepting the dogmatized models and tools for educational institutions management, which were imposed by the West and initially designed for underdeveloped backward countries. Unfortunately, this situation has determined many dysfunctions in education, concerning foremost classical university education. Completely predictably, it led to disorientation of student youth that began focusing on narrowly applied aspects of future professional activity, which are secondary in terms of social significance. The article emphasizes the importance of preserving the best traditions of the Russian higher education within the framework of classical universities, which have always played a leading role in the reproduction of the elite of the society. Key points are identified that make it possible to specify the essence of the elite reproduced by classical universities. The author demonstrates that the future presidents and prime ministers, Nobel laureates, internationally renowned writers graduated from the most famous universities in the world, with the Lomonosov Moscow State University preserving a leading place among them. For example, when Russian science was living through its historical rise, it was led by the Moscow University graduates, including S. I. Vavilov, A. N. Nesmeyanov, M. V. Keldysh. Overcoming the populist approaches to contemporary education, return to the fundamentality and breadth of domestic education, focus on the traditional “scientific education”, as well as the intellectual potential of the best educational institutions in Russia are regarded as the most important tasks for reforming the whole system of education in which classical universities played and will play a major role. </p...|$|R

40|$|This study’s {{purpose was}} to gain an {{understanding}} of how academic culture and structure are positioned within the <b>policy</b> process <b>of</b> academic <b>reorganization.</b> The growing practice <b>of</b> academic <b>reorganization</b> at colleges and universities in the United States often involves the dismantling of traditional academic departments, the organization of faculty as communities of scholars within disciplines, and the resultant reduction in faculty serving as department chairs. The results of content analysis of documents associated with academic restructuring at three institutions revealed that academic structure was perceived as an obstacle to the achievement of each institution’s respective goals. Thus, restructuring was undertaken as a solution to a problem and as a tactic to achieve an institutional strategy. The results suggest that some faculty and administrators share the belief that academic structure may be less of an obstacle to institutional goals than organizational culture, and that institutional goals could likely be achieved without significant changes to the academic structure if attention is paid to issues of culture. Most often, the problematic issues associated with culture {{have to do with the}} perception of inequality of levels of respect among the disciplines. Themes that emerged from the content analysis and the application of a theoretical model <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> process include: (1) the portrayal of academic culture and structure as hindrances to institutional goals, and the resultant degradation of faculty governance and advocacy; (2) the value placed on actions described as the corporatization of the university in the quest to enhance revenue generation and academic reputation; and (3) the opening <b>of</b> a <b>policy</b> window for academic restructuring vis-à-vis actions by the respective institution’s Boards of Trustees. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{enactment}} of the 2006 Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the PRC marked a new stage in China’s bankruptcy regime by the inclusion <b>of</b> a new <b>reorganization</b> system. The first 5 years of {{the implementation of the}} law and further scholarly research, however, have exposed the problems that underlie it, especially those concerning the <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> listed companies. The pressing need to address these problems calls for {{a better understanding of the}} goals <b>of</b> <b>reorganization.</b> This is because it is by applying the criterion of what best serves the desired reorganization goals that distinguishes an optimal from a less-than-optimal reorganization law and sense from nonsense in its implementation. Thus far, however, no scholar has carried out systemic research <b>of</b> China’s <b>reorganization</b> goals. This thesis, set out in two parts, attempts to fill this gap in the literature for both the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> legislation and the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> implementation in China. Employing the methods of theoretical analysis, economic analysis of law, case analysis and comparative study, the first part of this thesis argues that preserving going-concern surplus and fair distribution are the two fundamental goals <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> in China. Although protecting community interest is important, it should be considered only an incidental goal <b>of</b> <b>reorganization.</b> The second part of this thesis examines how the most important aspects <b>of</b> the current <b>reorganization</b> system under the EBL can be improved so as to better achieve the two fundamental goals in reality. As to the goal of preserving going-concern surplus, it discusses the early rescue, preservation and sale of the viable parts of the business in a distressed enterprise. As to the goal of fair distribution, it analyzes both the distributional boundaries and rules <b>of</b> <b>reorganization,</b> with a focus on the absolute priority rule. How to balance the values underlying the two fundamental goals <b>of</b> <b>reorganization</b> and the practical impediments to the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>reorganization</b> law are then discussed. Both a sound grasp <b>of</b> the <b>reorganization</b> goals under the EBL and a deep understanding of why and how specific reorganization mechanisms and provisions exist to serve these goals are needed. Only with such understanding, together with a grasp of the relationships between different fundamental goals and different mechanisms and provisions, can the efforts aiming to improve China’s reorganization system achieve the desired level of effectiveness as a whole. published_or_final_versionLawMasterDoctor of Legal Studie...|$|R
