5|$|Greenlandic verbs inflect for {{agreement}} with agent and <b>patient,</b> <b>for</b> mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four {{are used in}} independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms. The inflectional system is further {{complicated by the fact}} that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and <b>patient</b> <b>for</b> each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a patient}} is {{enrolled}} in hospice, the hospice becomes the insurance payor for that <b>patient</b> <b>for</b> any hospice-related illnesses. In other words, if {{a patient is}} on hospice for end-stage congestive heart failure, the hospice is responsible for all care related to the heart failure. However, if the patient were to see a podiatrist, this would be billed through their regular insurance.|$|E
30|$|Results Our study {{included}} 420 patients, 123 men and 297 women, {{and the mean}} age was 26 [20, 35] years. Our two groups gathered 273 <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> the G 1 and 147 <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> G 2, and they were comparable for demographic and anamnestic data.|$|R
50|$|All podiatrists may refer <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> Medicare rebatable plain x-rays of the foot, leg, {{knee and}} femur, {{as well as}} {{ultrasound}} examination of soft tissue conditions of the foot. Podiatrists may refer <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> other radiology investigations such as CT, MRI or bone scans, however Medicare rebates do not currently exist for these examinations. Similarly, podiatrists may refer patients when needed to specialist medical practitioners, or for pathology testing, however similar exclusions in the Medicare Benefits Schedule prevent rebates being available to <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> these referrals.|$|R

5|$|Physicians: Medical care is {{traditionally}} focused on curing and healing the <b>patient.</b> <b>For</b> many, hospice {{care is not}} seen as the true practice of medicine. Physicians face a persistent social stigma in that hospice is mistaken as giving up on a patient, rather than committing to palliation. Additionally, and although this perception has been changing, when thinking of hospice the doctor is often focused on patients with cancer and not {{many of the other}} terminal diseases which qualify for hospice care.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a systematic {{process for the}} development of educational audio-visual materials that are designed to prepare <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> potentially threatening procedures. Literature relating to the preparation of <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> potentially threatening medical procedures, psychological theory, theory of diffusion of innovations and patient information was examined. Four key principles were identified as being important: (1) stakeholder consultation, (2) provision of information to prepare <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> the medical procedure, (3) evidence-based content, and (4) promotion of patient confidence. These principles are described along with an example of the development of an audio-visual resource to prepare <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> chemotherapy treatment. Using this example, practical strategies for the application of each of the principles are described. The principles and strategies described may provide a practical, evidence-based guide to the development of other types of patient audio-visual materials...|$|R

25|$|Food challenges, {{especially}} double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, are {{the gold}} standard for diagnosis of food allergies, including most non-IgE-mediated reactions. Blind food challenges involve packaging the suspected allergen into a capsule, giving it to the patient, and observing the <b>patient</b> <b>for</b> signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction.|$|E
25|$|Another type of {{psychiatric}} hospital is medium term, which provides care lasting several weeks. Most drugs used {{for psychiatric purposes}} take several weeks to take effect, and {{the main purpose of}} these hospitals is to monitor the <b>patient</b> <b>for</b> the first few weeks of therapy to ensure the treatment is effective.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{established}} the age ranges for women seeking breast implants; for breast reconstruction, silicone-gel filled implants and saline-filled implants were approved {{for women of}} all ages; for breast augmentation, saline implants were approved for women 18 {{years of age and}} older; silicone implants were approved for women 22 years of age and older. Because each breast implant device entails different medical risks, the minimum age of the <b>patient</b> <b>for</b> saline breast implants is different from the minimum age of the <b>patient</b> <b>for</b> silicone breast implants—because of the filler leakage and silent shell-rupture risks; thus, periodic MRI screening examinations are the recommended post-operative, follow-up therapy for the patient. In other countries, in Europe and Oceania, the national health ministries' breast implant policies do not endorse periodic MRI screening of asymptomatic patients, but suggest palpation proper—with or without an ultrasonic screening—to be sufficient post-operative therapy for most patients.|$|E
30|$|To {{define a}} {{population}} of morbidly obese <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> study, 49 <b>patients</b> (5.9 %) whose body mass index (BMI) was < 40, as well as 16 patients (1.9 %) whose height and/or weight data were missing, {{were excluded from the}} analysis leaving 759 patients. Genotyping was then performed on available DNA from 709 of these patients. Gender, age, race, diagnoses, and medication use were obtained from the EHR on all <b>patients.</b> Values <b>for</b> laboratory measurements were obtained on at least 98 % of <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> glomerular filtration rate, glucose, bun, sodium, potassium, chloride, CO 2, calcium, and creatinine; on at least 97 % of <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> white blood cell count (wbc), red blood cell count (rbc), hemoglobin (hgb), hematocrit (hct), mean cell volume (mcv), mean cell hemoglobin (mch), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (mchc), and red cell distribution width (rdw); on at least 96 % of <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> triglycerides, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl), alanine aminotransferase (alt), aspartate aminotransferase (ast), alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh); and on at least 94 % of <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> low density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl calculated), insulin, and hemoglobin A 1 c. Values were obtained on lower percentages of <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> iron (81 %), iron binding capacity (81 %), ferritin (81 %), platelet count (86 %), mean platelet volume (86 %) albumin (33 %), and total protein (33 %). An “iron panel” (iron, iron binding capacity, and ferritin) was added to the clinical protocol after recruitment had begun, which accounts for the lower percentage of <b>patients</b> <b>for</b> those values. A platelet count and mean platelet volume were not reported if a hemoglobin and hematocrit was ordered rather than a complete blood count, which likely accounts for the lower percentage <b>for</b> these <b>patients.</b> Total protein and albumin were ordered only if nutritional status was deemed clinically necessary to evaluate.|$|R

25|$|Jung {{recommended}} spirituality as a {{cure for}} alcoholism and he is considered to have had an indirect role in establishing Alcoholics Anonymous. Jung once treated an American patient (Rowland Hazard III), suffering from chronic alcoholism. After working with the <b>patient</b> <b>for</b> some time and achieving no significant progress, Jung told the man that his alcoholic condition was near to hopeless, save only {{the possibility of a}} spiritual experience.

25|$|The {{physical}} examination is {{the examination of}} the <b>patient</b> <b>for</b> medical signs of disease, which are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms which are volunteered by the patient and not necessarily objectively observable. The healthcare provider uses the senses of sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis). Four actions are the basis of {{physical examination}}: inspection, palpation (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and auscultation (listen), generally in that order although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.|$|E
