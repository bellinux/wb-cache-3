50|$|To {{determine}} the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> front suspension <b>braking</b> anti-dive for outboard brakes, {{it is first necessary}} to {{determine the}} tangent of the angle between a line drawn, in side view, through the front tire patch and the front suspension instant center, and the horizontal.

50|$|Due to {{the fact}} that a drum brake's {{friction}} contact area is at the circumference <b>of</b> the <b>brake,</b> a drum brake can provide more braking force than an equal diameter disc brake.

Drum brakes retain heat and are more complex than disc brakes but are often the more economical and powerful brake type to use in rear brake applications due to the low heat generation <b>of</b> rear <b>brakes,</b> a drum brake's self-applying nature, larger friction surface contact area, and long life wear characteristics (%life used/kW <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> <b>power).</b>|$|R

50|$|Common {{types of}} leaks {{for many people}} include leaks in vehicle tires, causing air to leak out {{resulting}} in flat tires, and leaks in containers, spilling the contents. Leaks can occur or develop in {{many different kinds of}} household, building, vehicle, marine, aircraft, or industrial fluid systems, whether the fluid is a gas or liquid. Leaks in vehicle hydraulic systems such as <b>brake</b> or <b>power</b> steering lines could cause outleakage <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> or <b>power</b> steering fluid resulting in failure <b>of</b> the <b>brakes,</b> <b>power</b> steering, or other hydraulic system. Also possible are leaks of engine coolant - particularly in the radiator and at the water pump seal, transmission fluid, motor oil, and refrigerant in the air conditioning system. Some of these vehicle fluids have different colors to help identify the type of leaking fluid. A zinc-carbon battery is an example of an easy-leaking system; the electrolytes inside the cell sometimes leak out of the cell casing and cause damage to an electronic appliance.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{research}} aims {{development of}} methods for calculating the estimated capacity humps {{for the loss}} conditions <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> retarders. Methodology. The operation of humps is connected with large number of random factors, such as the characteristics of cuts, environmental conditions, the value <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> implemented by retardants and others. In this regard, to research the set tasks the methods of simulation modeling and mathematical statistics are used. Determination of speed and motion time of cuts on the routes is carried out {{on the basis of}} rolling down modeling of their rolling down from the humps. Findings. If the <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> retarders of the rolling down part of humps is not enough to stop the cuts, it should be provided the intervals during break-up to release the rolling routes from the preliminary cuts. The dependencies allowing to set the duration of these intervals were determined using the methods of the probability theory If the <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> retarders at the rolling down part of humps and at the classification tracks is not enough to meet the requirements of the aimed regulation of the cuts rolling speed, it is necessary the use the additional brake shoes. The work develops the methods that on the basis of simulation modeling of the humping process allow one to set the desired value of the break-up duration increase. They ensure the traffic safety at the given number of car motion speed regulators. Originality. Authors firstly proposed the improved methods for determining the estimated capacity of humps. Unlike the existing ones, allow taking into account the technological limitations caused by the requirements of the humping process safety and can be used to assess the performance of the humps in the conditions of parametric failures of the retarders.

40|$|Loss <b>of</b> <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> {{and rubber}} {{skidding}} on a wet road {{is still an}} open physics problem, since neither the hydrodynamical effects nor the loss of surface adhesion that are sometimes blamed really manage to explain the 20 - 30 % observed loss of low speed tire-road friction. Here we advance a novel mechanism based on sealing of water-filled substrate pools by the rubber. The sealed-in water effectively smoothens the substrate, thus reducing the viscoelastic dissipation in bulk rubber induced by surface asperities, well established as a major friction contribution. Starting with the measured spectrum of asperities one can calculate the water-smoothened spectrum and from that the predicted friction reduction, which is of the right magnitude. The theory is directly supported by fresh tire-asphalt friction data. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures. Published on Nature Materials (November 7 th 2004...|$|R
