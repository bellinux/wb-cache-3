50|$|While {{the educated}} elites had largely {{abandoned}} {{their belief in}} the reality of witchcraft, this belief remained widespread in popular culture. From this point on, it was very rare for an accused witch to undergo a judicial process and be threatened with execution, {{but there was still}} a danger from <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> and lynch mobs. The death of Ruth Osborne is an example of one such case that occurred in 1751. The last person in Germany to be executed for witchcraft was fifteen-year-old Veronika Zeritschin, who was beheaded and then burned on April 2, 1756 in Landshut.|$|E
50|$|The {{machine was}} {{successful}} {{because it was}} considered a humane form of execution, contrasting with the methods used in pre-revolutionary Ancien Régime. In France, before {{the invention of the}} guillotine, members of the nobility were beheaded with a sword or an axe, which often took two or more blows to kill the condemned. (The condemned or their families would sometimes pay the executioner to ensure that the blade was sharp, to achieve a quick and relatively painless death.) Commoners were usually hanged, which could take many minutes. In the early phase of the French Revolution, the slogan À la lanterne (in English: To the Lamp Post!, String Them Up! or Hang Them!) had become a symbol of <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> in revolutionary France. The revolutionary radicals hanged officials and aristocrats from street lanterns. Other more gruesome methods of execution were also used, such as the wheel or burning at the stake.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{he led the}} Quechua peasant {{uprising}} in the Cuzco region of Peru. He was the first who managed to build {{a bridge between the}} Spanish speaking intellectuals and the Quechua speaking workers. He organised the 2000 peasants in trade unions which occupied the landowners' lands and organised the defence of the occupations against the police and the landowners. His organisation controlled an area, where national control did not exist, there he put an agrarian reform into effect. He set up a peasant trade union in the valleys of Convencion and Lares in Cuzco. Blanco's Chaupimayo Community had its government, public law, <b>popular</b> <b>justice,</b> defense and education, Blanco called this [...] "dual power" [...] It was reported at this time that, while he was arresting a hacienda owner in Pucyura who raped a little girl, he shot a police officer in self-defense. According to some historians this seems to be propaganda, since he could not have been at Pucyura at the time. De la Puente rejected a union with Blanco because Blanco was a Trotskyist. Captured by the military, he was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment on the island of El Frontón. Nearly all his Trotskyist comrades where already in prison when he was captured. In 1963, unionists took the city of Quillabamba, who were carrying out an order, that was issued in Cuzco by the Federation, to go on strike, so that some imprisoned union leaders, among them, Hugo Blanco would be freed. During his imprisonment he wrote Land or Death: The Peasant Struggle in Peru. During this time he exchanged letters with José María Arguedas which were written in Quechua. In 1968 he was chosen by the Swedish section of Amnesty International as prisoner of the Year.|$|E

5000|$|The federalist revolt {{occurred}} {{in the summer of}} 1793, at a pivotal moment in the French Revolution. The name itself suggests a decentralizing movement, a reaction to the strong central government emerging at that time under Jacobin leadership in Paris. But while the revolt was based in provincial cities, the rebels did not seek a federated republic. Rather the [...] protested against what they took to be a violation of the unity and integrity of the national assembly.The national assembly at that moment {{in the course of the}} Revolution was known as the National Convention, elected in the fall of 1792 after Louis XVI had been toppled from power by a Parisian uprising. Almost from its first meeting, the National Convention was hopelessly divided between two rival factions: the moderate Girondin deputies and the radical Montagnards. The first point of contention was the September Massacres, which claimed the lives of more than one thousand alleged counterrevolutionaries in the prisons of Paris. The Girondin leadership soon denounced the killings as the inevitable consequence of public anarchy, and accused leading Montagnards of having incited the violence. The Montagnards, many of them the champions of the Paris crowd, defended the massacres as a regrettable, but necessary, instance of <b>popular</b> <b>justice.</b> This polarity carried over into the trial of Louis XVI, the stalemate over the constitution of 1793, the trial of Jean-Paul Marat, and the ongoing debate about the legitimacy of popular politics and the influence of the Paris crowd on national politics. This bitter division within the National Convention, decried both by Parisians and by many citizens of the provinces, came to an end following the uprising of 31 May to 2 June 1793, when Parisian militants forced the proscription of twenty-nine Girondin deputies. Nearly fifty departmental administrations protested that action by letter, and some thirteen departments engaged in prolonged resistance to the Montagnard Convention in what has come to be known as the federalist revolt.The revolt centered around four provincial cities—Bordeaux, Caen, Lyon, and Marseille—and in each instance it was departmental administrators who took the leading role. Typically the rebels constituted a new popular assembly to lead the resistance, in order to claim the mandate of the people for their actions, and probably to deflect charges of treason from official administrative councils. In addition to sending delegations or letters of protest to Paris, they declared themselves in a state of resistance to oppression, withdrew their recognition of the National Convention and all legislation issued since 31 May, and called on their constituents to take up arms and march to the capital to restore the proscribed deputies to office. In Caen and Marseille the rebels arrested representatives on mission (national deputies) in the early stages of the revolt, taking them as hostages, in a sense, against the safety of the proscribed Girondins.Seven Breton and Norman departments sent delegates to the Central Committee of Resistance to Oppression, meeting in Caen. That assembly issued a manifesto, the closest thing that exists to a federalist program. In mid-July a small force left Caen for Paris, but there was little popular support for the revolt in Normandy or elsewhere and the call for a march on Paris failed to mount a serious threat to the capital. The Norman force dispersed after a single, farcical battle near Vernon, and none of the other rebel forces even left the limits of their own departments. Coupled with the peasant rebellions in the Vendée, however, the federalist revolt confronted the young French Republic with the very real danger of civil war, and the Montagnards responded forcefully to that threat. First they presented a defense of the 31 May uprising and the proscription of the Girondin deputies, which they circulated to the provinces via special envoys. Then they moved quickly to complete a new constitution, adopted in the Convention and presented to the nation in late June. In July the Montagnards prepared an indictment of the proscribed deputies, though they would not be brought to trial until October. Finally, the Committee of Public Safety sent armed forces to suppress the rebellion in those areas that continued to resist.The federalist revolt collapsed quickly in Caen, and Robert Lindet oversaw a remarkably mild repression in the late summer months, dismissing rebel officials from office, placing many under arrest, but ordering no executions. In Bordeaux and Marseille, where resistance to Paris endured until the final days of summer, the revolt came to an end without violent resistance, but the repression that followed sent roughly three hundred rebels to the guillotine in each city. In Lyon, however, the federalist rebels executed the leading Jacobin in the city, Joseph Chalier, and the city capitulated only after a two-month siege. In October the National Convention decreed that [...] "Lyon is no more," [...] renamed it [...] "Ville-Affranchie" [...] (Freed City), and sent the representatives on mission, Georges Couthon, Jean-Marie Collet d'Herbois, and Joseph Fouché, to oversee the repression. They ordered the execution of more than nineteen hundred rebels, making Lyon one of the bloodiest sites of the Terror.Although the federalist revolt was nominally a reaction to the proscription of the Girondin deputies, the causes of the revolt ran much deeper. Political elites in the provinces had grown wary of the militant activism of the Parisian sans-culottes, and often felt threatened by the mobilization of popular politics in their own towns. They resented what they considered the excessive influence of Paris on national politics and the interference of representatives on mission in local affairs. In the federalist revolt, then, national and local politics came together, as the French revolutionaries struggled to define sovereignty and how it should be exercised.|$|E
40|$|<b>Popular</b> <b>justice</b> as a {{field of}} study is marked by {{profound}} conceptual confusion and is regarded by many as an imbroglio of misunderstanding. In this critique I present reasons for believing that this problem {{has its roots in}} Richard L. Abel’s influential theory of ‘informal justice’. I show that this term as used by Abel is a logically confused malapropism for <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> which is based on a fundamental category mistake that vitiates his definitional apparatus (his ‘general theory’) of <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> from top to bottom. This critique shows that his self-styled ‘contradictions of informal justice ’ are artefacts of his own general theory of <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> and are not based on anything inherently contradictory in the nature of <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> itself. An additional criticism is that Abel’s general theory is a one-sided ‘lawyer’s theory ’ of justice which excludes by definitional fiat the most basic kind of <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> of all. This critique concludes by showing how these defects along with other factors have caused Abel to fundamentally misconstrue the Alexandra Treason Trial and to obscure the roles played by <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> and sociology in this important South African jurisprudential event.

40|$|Popular justice” can {{be roughly}} defined as “the {{exercise}} of justice by the people”. The institutions and practices pertaining to {{this form of}} justice vary widely across time and geographical space. The 18 th and 19 th centuries constitute a key historical period for the transition to <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> in Europe. On the one hand, many long-standing practices (“ducking”, “Rügegerichte”) were progressively called into question. On the other hand, the democratization of European societies and the progressive advent of political liberalism helped bring about {{the emergence of an}} institutionalized <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> with the establishment of institutions such as the justice of the peace and the jury. The legitimacy of <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> remained nonetheless weak due to the government’s fear of losing control and regal powers. Its establishment further depended on the degree of modernisation of the States, which for the most part remained firmly anchored in the Ancien Régime. Despite the importance of <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> during the 18 th and 19 th centuries, scholars have largely ignored this field of research or have limited their study to a national perspective. The very definition of <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> remains vague and requires further conceptual analyses.

40|$|What {{happens when}} a <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> program fails? Academic discussions of {{alternative}} dispute resolution have frequently questioned the likelihood that <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> programs will be accepted by their publics in either advanced industrial or Third World nations (Abel 1982, Hayden 1990, Merry 1993). In this paper, however, I examine an instance in which a <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> program had been positively received for a decade, but where, because {{of a variety of}} circumstances, it ceased to perform effectively. My aim here, however, is not to concentrate on why this occurred, but, instead, to explore the consequences of this change in the legal system. I will argue that in understanding this transformation we must simultaneously examine both the local dynamics of dispute resolution and the impact of transnational processes that have altered the socio-economic context of the program (Merry 1992). The subject of my paper is the Papua New Guinea village courts, especially the courts of the Agarabi region of the Eastern Highlands Kainantu District. I will begin by briefly outlining the village court's operation through the mid- 1980 s, then turn to the circumstances that led to the court's decline {{toward the end of the}} decade. The official alternatives to the village court available to disputants in 1989 will be reviewed next. Since many disputes are not subject to the jurisdiction of these forums, however, I then discuss the interconnections of economic change and dispute resolution. Finally, since religious change has altered the pattern of community order to a considerable extent, I conclude by analyzing the impact of Christian ideology upon the nature of conflict in the Eastern Highlands...|$|E
40|$|T LEAST {{since the}} {{emergence}} of the world economic system, forms of <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> have spread from one place to another, from the core to JL the periphery and sometimes back to the core, the various manifestations reshaping each other.

To give some examples of the interconnections of <b>popular</b> <b>justice</b> in the past, after the Chinese Revolution in 1949, Mao Zedong turned to the Soviet Comrades ’ Courts for inspiration. The Soviet tribunals were first proposed by Lenin in 1919 to educate the masses and were implemented in the USSR in the 1950 s. In 1949, Sri Lanka implemented local conciliation courts modeled on India’s experiments in village councils (Tiruchelvam, 1984).

In 1854 Spain suffered several Progresist-cut revolutions which took place caused by an unsustainable situation: the Conservative groups (called moderates) had held power for ten years, with politics of its last years being a nest of corruption, ornamented with anti-constitutional nuances.
