25|$|Increased {{pollution}} {{is expected to}} occur in some areas with the adoption of PHEVs, but most areas will experience a decrease. A study by the ACEEE predicts that widespread PHEV use in heavily coal-dependent areas would result {{in an increase in}} local net sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions, given emissions levels from most coal plants currently supplying power to the grid. Although clean coal technologies could create power plants which supply grid power from coal without emitting significant amounts of such pollutants, the higher cost of the application of these technologies may increase the price of coal-generated electricity. The net effect on {{pollution is}} dependent on the fuel source of the electrical grid (fossil or renewable, for example) and the pollution profile of the power plants themselves. Identifying, regulating and upgrading single point <b>pollution</b> <b>source</b> such as a power plant—or replacing a plant altogether—may also be more practical. From a human health perspective, shifting pollution away from large urban areas may be considered a significant advantage.|$|E

40|$|With {{huge amount}} of {{observed}} air quality and components data, it is of great challenge to analyze and trace the pollutant diffusion path. Partitioning the air <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> (air quality observation stations) into subnetworks will help a lot in tracing the air pollution diffusion path. Conventional air <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> clustering methods, {{which are based on}} geography or pollutant levels, present weak correlation with pollution transmission links. In order to overcome such problem, a method of air <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> clustering via activation force (AF) model is introduced in this paper. We model the connections of the <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> by AF so that the relationship among the observation stations and the coincidence of the transmission links can be modeled effectively. With the affinity matrix obtained via AF modeling, we conduct clustering of the air <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> via modularity measurement. Compared to K-means clustering method purely, which is based on the air quality index of pollutants, the proposed approach shows several advantages in air pollution network clustering...|$|R

However these sanitary facilities are not built as per the design specifications or they are not suitable for the geophysical characteristics, which results in seepage into the fresh water lens and run off into coastal waters.|$|E

40|$|Pollution is {{a severe}} problem today, {{and the main}} {{challenge}} in water and air pollution controls and eliminations is detecting and locating <b>pollution</b> <b>sources.</b> This research project aims to predict the locations of <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> given diffusion information of pollution {{in the form of}} array or image data. These predictions are done using machine learning. The relations between time, location, and pollution concentration are first formulated as pollution diffusion equations, which are partial differential equations (PDEs), and then deep convolutional neural networks are built and trained to solve these PDEs. The convolutional neural networks consist of convolutional layers, reLU layers and pooling layers with chosen parameters. This model is able to solve diffusion equations with an error rate of 2. 192 percent. With this model, the inverse problem can be solved and <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> can be predicted with an error rate of 2. 18 percent.

40|$|Abstract. The goal of our {{research}} was to conduct a systematic study of ground water nitrate pollution in the Niraj (Nyárád) River Basin, to evaluate this contamination, and it’s causes. Samples of water were obtained from individual water sources (wells) from villages and from surface water sources. In the individual water sources the concentration of nitrate has increased significantly over time, exceeding {{in many cases the}} maximum contaminant level, indicating a potential health risk to nearby residents. The relationship between the potential <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> and groundwater nitrate pollution was analyzed in function of the agricultural practices, the nature of the <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> (punctual and diffuse <b>pollution</b> <b>sources),</b> the geographical conditions, hydrological conditions, and rainfall regime. During {{our research}} we linked the diffuse and punctual <b>pollution</b> <b>sources</b> with the spatial distribution of nitrate pollution of groundwater. According to our research the main cause of pollution of the groundwater with nitrate is the type of agricultural practices employed, especially small scale farming with animals and bad management of the manure/waste and the untreated household’s wastewater. In the Niraj catchment area, in 43 % of the sampled wells, the nitrate pollution exceeds 50 mg/l. The result...|$|R
