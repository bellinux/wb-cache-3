5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival,</b> and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the birds}} begin to forage on their own, they {{move away from}} their parents' territory; young birds have been found nearly 500km away from their nest site. One-year-old European birds migrate to Africa and stay there {{for at least one}} year. A vulture that fledged in France stayed in Africa for three years before {{migrating}} north in spring. After migrating back to their breeding areas, young birds move widely in search of good feeding territories and mates. The full adult plumage is attained in the fourth or fifth year. Egyptian vultures have been known to live for up to 37 years in captivity and at least 21 years in the wild. The <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> in the wild varies with age, increasing till the age of 2 and then falling at the age of 5. Older birds have an annual survival probability varying from 0.75 for non-breeders to 0.83 for breeding birds.|$|E

We discuss the influence <b>of</b> <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> the individuals on the dynamics and phenotypic variability of the population. We show that constant <b>survival</b> <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> individuals are propitious for preserving phenotypic variability of the population. For constant <b>survival</b> <b>probabilities</b> oscillations <b>of</b> 'the average fitness' {{of the population and}} normal distributions of the phenotypes are observed. When the <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> are directly proportinal to the individuals' adaptations the population can reach the maximum possible average adaptation, but the phenotypic variability of the {{population is}} completely lost and oscillations of 'the average fitness' of the population do not occur.

[...] This issue is important if the source-sink concept is viewed in terms of habitat quality (as it is in Table 1) because classifying high-quality habitat as low-quality may lead to mistakes in ecological management. [...] Runge et al. showed how to integrate the theory of source-sink dynamics with population projection matrices and ecological statistics in order to differentiate sources and sinks.|$|E

In this paper we analyze the subjective <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> to specific target ages provided by respondents to the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). To evaluate how these probabilities compare with objective data from life tables, and avoid {{the problems associated with}} a naive use of period life tables, we construct cohort life tables from the sequence of period life tables available in the Human Mortality Database and use them to compute actuarial <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> to the same target ages. We find that male subjective survival probabilities are close to the probabilities computed from the cohort life tables, whereas female subjective probabilities are always lower. We also find that subjective survival probabilities are on average higher for more educated people, those whose household income is higher, and those with better health. This evidence suggests that both income and health matter for own assessments <b>of</b> subjective <b>survival.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Cross-country {{comparisons}} <b>of</b> differential <b>survival</b> by {{socioeconomic status}} (SES) {{are useful in}} many domains. Yet, to date, such studies have been rare. Reliably estimating differential survival in a single country has been challenging because it requires rich panel data with a large sample size. Cross-country estimates have proven even more difficult because the measures of SES need to be comparable internationally. We present an alternative method for acquiring information on differential survival by SES. Rather than using observations <b>of</b> actual <b>survival,</b> we relate individuals' subjective <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> to SES variables in cross section. To show that subjective survival probabilities are informative proxies for actual survival when estimating differential survival, we compare estimates <b>of</b> differential <b>survival</b> based on actual survival with estimates based on subjective <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> for the same sample. The results are remarkably similar. We then use this approach to compare differential survival by SES for 10 European countries and the United States.

40|$|Estimates of {{differential}} mortality by socioeconomic status {{play an important}} role in several domains: in public policy for assessing distributional effects of public programs; in financial markets for the design of life insurance and annuities; and in individual decision making when figuring out how much to save for retirement. Traditionally, reliable estimates {{of differential}} mortality require rich panel data with large sample size. This paper proposes a new, less data-intensive approach relying on just a single cross-section of data. Rather than using observations on actual mortality in panel over time, the authors propose relating individuals' subjective <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> to variables <b>of</b> socioeconomic status in cross-section. They formulate the method in a model of survey response and provide an empirical validation based on data from the Health and Retirement Study comparing the alternative estimates to the traditional estimates of differential mortality for the same sample of baseline respondents. They present two applications. First, they document an increase in differential mortality in the U.
