40|$|This {{research}} project {{serves as a}} reference on measuring and determining the network performance upon the <b>Power</b> <b>over</b> <b>Ethernet</b> (PoE) connection. With the emerging evolution of network devices compatible with <b>Power</b> <b>over</b> <b>Ethernet</b> technology, PoE had become the main choice for powering access points, IP phones, network camera and mobile kiosk as PoE technology enables data and power supply being sent through the same Ethernet cable. There are three different experiments conducted through this research paper which are default testing, environment testing and range testing. The data transmission behavior is observed and recorded {{before and after the}} adoption of <b>Power</b> <b>over</b> <b>Ethernet</b> technology. For conclusion, the <b>Power</b> <b>over</b> <b>Ethernet</b> technology does not degrade the network performance for home environment. This important finding is revealed through all experiments conducted through the thesis project...|$|R

50|$|Aside from {{changes to}} the network (wires and {{switching}} and management) a well designed future-proof wireless network may not require much change at the endpoints. All equipment used in a wireless backhaul configuration supports simultaneous dual band communication (one band for user communication, another for the backhaul). Almost all such equipment also supports wired connections, typically using <b>power</b> <b>over</b> <b>Ethernet</b> or (less often in outdoor applications) unpowered Ethernet. So assuming reasonable software flexibility, both bands can be repurposed to user connectivity while the backhaul shifts to a wired connection. Unless nodes are entirely self-powered, they are connected at least indirectly to an AC or DC power source, suggesting that the single-cable solutions (<b>power</b> <b>over</b> <b>Ethernet</b> DC and IEEE P1901 AC) for both power and data should dominate for low-power shorter-range nodes, especially municipal Wi-Fi projects in low usage rural areas.|$|R
