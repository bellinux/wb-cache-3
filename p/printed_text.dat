5|$|Some Bach {{scholars}} {{believed that}} the cantata was written in 1734 {{for the end of}} the War of the Polish Succession, but the discovery of the <b>printed</b> <b>text</b> showed that it was not related.

5|$|ITC Garamond {{was created}} by Tony Stan in 1975, and follows ITC's house style of unusually high x-height. It was {{initially}} intended {{to serve as a}} display version but has been used for text, in which its tight spacing and high x-height gives it a somewhat hectoring appearance. As a result, it has proven somewhat controversial among designers; it is generally considered poorly proportioned for body text. It remains the corporate font of the California State University system in <b>printed</b> <b>text.</b> As seen below, it was also modified into Apple Garamond which served as Apple's corporate font from 1984 until replacement starting in 2002 with Myriad. Publishers using it included O'Reilly Media and French publisher Actes Sud.|$|E

5|$|Shaw's major {{plays of}} {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century address {{individual}} social, political or ethical issues. Man and Superman (1902) stands apart from the others in both its subject and its treatment, giving Shaw's interpretation of creative evolution in a combination of drama and associated <b>printed</b> <b>text.</b> The Admirable Bashville (1901), a blank verse dramatisation of Shaw's novel Cashel Byron's Profession, focuses on the imperial relationship between Britain and Africa. John Bull's Other Island (1904), comically depicting the prevailing relationship between Britain and Ireland, was popular at the time but fell out of the general repertoire in later years. Major Barbara (1905) presents ethical questions in an unconventional way, confounding expectations that in the depiction of an armaments manufacturer on the one hand and the Salvation Army on the other the moral high ground must invariably be held by the latter. The Doctor's Dilemma (1906), a play about medical ethics and moral choices in allocating scarce treatment, was described by Shaw as a tragedy. With a reputation for presenting characters who did not resemble real flesh and blood, he was challenged by Archer to present an on-stage death, and here did so, with a deathbed scene for the anti-hero.|$|E

25|$|In computing, {{an image}} scanner is {{a device that}} {{optically}} scans images (<b>printed</b> <b>text,</b> handwriting, or an object) and converts it to a digital image which is transferred to a computer. Among other formats, flat, drum and film scanners exist, {{and most of them}} support RGB color. They can be considered the successors of early telephotography input devices, which were able to send consecutive scan lines as analog amplitude modulation signals through standard telephonic lines to appropriate receivers; such systems were in use in press since the 1920s to the mid-1990s. Color telephotographs were sent as three separated RGB filtered images consecutively.|$|E

25|$|In 1929, {{exactly a}} century after the {{publication}} of Lee's translation, the historian and orientalist Hamilton Gibb published an English translation of selected portions of Defrémery and Sanguinetti's Arabic text. Gibb had proposed to the Hakluyt Society in 1922 that he should prepare an annotated translation of the entire Rihla into English. His intention was to divide the translated text into four volumes, each volume corresponding to one of the volumes published by Defrémery and Sanguinetti. The first volume was not published until 1958. Gibb died in 1971, having completed the first three volumes. The fourth volume was prepared by Charles Beckingham and published in 1994. Defrémery and Sanguinetti's <b>printed</b> <b>text</b> has now been translated into number of other languages.|$|E
25|$|Research {{scientists}} {{are the primary}} audience for the journal, but summaries and accompanying articles are intended to make {{many of the most}} important papers understandable to scientists in other fields and the educated public. Towards the front of each issue are editorials, news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientists, including current affairs, science funding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books and arts. The remainder of the journal consists mostly of research papers (articles or letters), which are often dense and highly technical. Because of strict limits on the length of papers, often the <b>printed</b> <b>text</b> is actually a summary of the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying supplementary material on the journal's website.|$|E
25|$|Within {{a week of}} {{his remarks}} on Tiananmen, Ma voiced support for the {{acceptance}} of simplified Chinese for written text and the continued use of traditional Chinese for <b>printed</b> <b>text.</b> Ma had to clarify his remarks regarding simplified characters at a 15-minute speech before the sixth International Conference on Internet Chinese Education on 19 June 2009. Ma reiterated his policy of urging the Chinese to learn the traditional system; his previous call was for the ability of Taiwan's population to recognize simplified characters and not for simplified characters to supplant the traditional system in Taiwan. In a 2004 speech hosted by Microsoft Taiwan, he had proposed for the traditional Chinese characters (繁體字; literally: complicated characters) to be instead called the 'formal characters' (正體字) (then the translation 'traditional Chinese characters' would be more appropriate as well).|$|E

500|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{manuscript}} or <b>printed</b> <b>text,</b> most information on the novel's subject comes from Waugh's diary entries and later reminiscences. The story was evidently semi-autobiographical, based on Waugh's Oxford experiences. The protagonist was an undergraduate and the work's main themes were madness and black magic. Some of the novel's ideas may have been incorporated into Waugh's first commercially published work of fiction, his 1925 short story [...] "The Balance", which includes several references to a country house called [...] "Thatch" [...] and is partly structured as a film script, as apparently was the lost novel. [...] "The Balance" [...] contains characters, perhaps carried over from The Temple at Thatch, who appear by name in Waugh's later fiction.|$|E
500|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} at the dedication service in Störmthal. The <b>printed</b> <b>text</b> mentions Bach as [...] "Hochfürstl. Anhalt-Cöthenischen Capell-Meister, auch Directore Chori musici Lipsiensis" [...] (Kapellmeister to the Prince of Anhalt-Köthen and Director of the Choir at Leipzig), referring to his appointments {{in the service of}} Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen. The organ of Störmthal is notable as one of few such instruments still mostly unaltered since Bach's time. A restorer in 1934 remarked that it was tuned about a whole tone lower than 440, which may account for the unusually high vocal ranges. Bach demanded [...] "top Cs" [...] from the sopranos, which is unique in his sacred cantatas. The organ part prepared for the Leipzig revival is notated a minor third lower than the other instruments.|$|E
500|$|Woodblock {{printing}} in Japan traces {{back to the}} Hyakumantō Darani in 770CE. [...] Until the 17th century such printing {{was reserved}} for Buddhist seals and images. [...] Movable type appeared around 1600, but as the Japanese writing system required about 100,000 type pieces, hand-carving text onto woodblocks was more efficient. [...] In Saga Domain, calligrapher Honami Kōetsu and publisher [...] combined <b>printed</b> <b>text</b> and images in an adaptation of The Tales of Ise (1608) and other works of literature. [...] During the Kan'ei era (1624–1643) illustrated books of folk tales called , or [...] "orange-green books", were the first books mass-produced using woodblock printing. [...] Woodblock imagery continued to evolve as illustrations to the [...] genre of tales of hedonistic urban life in the new capital. [...] The rebuilding of Edo following the Great Fire of Meireki in 1657 occasioned a modernization of the city, and the publication of illustrated printed books flourished in the rapidly urbanizing environment.|$|E
