Articles in scientific and lay journals include many definitions of chemical or toxicological synergy, often vague or in conflict with each other.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency has one of the more detailed and precise definitions of toxic interaction, designed to facilitate risk assessment. In their guidance documents, the no-interaction default assumption is dose addition, so synergy means a mixture response that exceeds that predicted from dose addition.

Methods and Results—We included 6329 cardiovascular disease–free and nonpregnant individuals ages 20 to 79 years, representing approximately 156 million US adults, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2004 and 2005 to 2006. We assigned 10 -year and lifetime predicted risks to stratify participants into 3 groups: low 10 -year (10 %) /low lifetime (39 %) <b>predicted</b> <b>risk,</b> low 10 -year (10 %) /high lifetime (39 %) <b>predicted</b> <b>risk,</b> and high 10 -year (10 %) <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> or diagnosed diabetes. The majority of US adults (56 %, or 87 million individuals) are at low short-term but high lifetime <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> for cardiovascular disease. Twenty-six percent (41 million adults) are at low short-term and low lifetime <b>predicted</b> <b>risk,</b> and only 18 % (28 million individuals) are at high short-term <b>predicted</b> <b>risk.</b> The addition of lifetime risk estimation to 10 -year risk estimation identifies higher-risk women and younger men in particular.

40|$|Object To {{assess the}} impact that injury {{severity}} has on complications in patients {{who have had a}} decompressive craniectomy for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods This prospective observational cohort study included all patients who underwent a decompressive craniectomy following severe TBI at the two major trauma hospitals in Western Australia from 2004 to 2012. All complications were recorded during this period. The clinical and radiological data of the patients on initial presentation were entered into a web-based model prognostic model, the CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head injury) collaborators prediction model, to obtain the <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> of an unfavourable outcome which was used as a measure of injury severity. Results Complications after decompressive craniectomy for severe TBI were common. The <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> of unfavourable outcome was strongly associated with the development of neurological complications such as herniation of the brain outside the skull bone defects (median <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> of unfavourable outcome for herniation 72 % vs. 57 % without herniation, p = 0. 001), subdural effusion (median <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> of unfavourable outcome 67 % with an effusion vs. 57 % for those without an effusion, p = 0. 03), hydrocephalus requiring ventriculo-peritoneal shunt (median <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> of unfavourable outcome 86 % for those with hydrocephalus vs. 59 % for those without hydrocephalus, p = 0. 001), but not infection (p = 0. 251) or resorption of bone flap (p = 0. 697) and seizures (0. 987).

METHODS AND FINDINGS: A secondary analysis of the CRASH- 2 trial (which originally evaluated the effect of tranexamic acid on mortality in trauma patients) was conducted. The trial included 20, 127 trauma patients with significant bleeding from 274 hospitals in 40 countries. We evaluated the association of RBC transfusion with mortality in four strata of <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> of death: 50 %. For this analysis the exposure considered was RBC transfusion, and the main outcome was death from all causes at 28 days. A total of 10, 227 patients (50. 8 %) received at least one transfusion.

The risk associated with RBC transfusion was significantly increased for all the <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> of death categories, but the relative increase was higher for those with the lowest (< 6 %) <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> of death (p-value for interaction < 0. 0001).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis study {{evaluated}} the cost-effectiveness of administering prophylactic intravenous (IV) amiodarone therapy to patients undergoing cardiac surgery {{according to their}} <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> of postoperative atrial fibrillation. BackgroundAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication of cardiovascular surgery {{that is associated with}} a significant increase in hospitalization costs. Intravenous amiodarone has been shown to decrease the incidence of postoperative AF. MethodsAll 8, 709 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 1, 217 patients who underwent valve replacement and 624 patients who underwent CABG and valve replacement procedures (CABG + valve) from January 1, 1994, to June 30, 1999, at Emory University Hospitals were studied. Models predicting the risk of AF were developed using logistic regression; linear regression was used to estimate the influence of AF on hospitalization costs. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated for patient subsets identified according to their <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> of AF. ResultsPostoperative AF rates were 17. 7 % for CABG, 24. 6 % for valve and 33. 8 % for CABG + valve. Using $ 5, 000 as an acceptable cost per episode of atrial fibrillation averted, prophylactic IV amiodarone in CABG patients was not found to be cost-effective. Therapy would be recommended for roughly 5 % of valve patients with a <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> of atrial fibrillation > 45 %, and roughly two thirds of CABG + valve patients who have a <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> of > 30 %. ConclusionsCost-effectiveness of prophylactic IV amiodarone varies according to type of surgery and the <b>predicted</b> <b>risk</b> of atrial fibrillation.

This {{study was designed to}} determine whether residual sleep disturbance (insomnia and hypersomnia) <b>predict</b> <b>risk</b> of relapse during the continuation and maintenance treatment of MDD. Methods A total of 570 patients with MDD were treated with open-label, flexible dose fluoxetine (range 20 to 60 mg; mean dose = 45. 8 mg/day; SD = 15. 1) for 12 weeks. Under double blind conditions, 262 patients who achieved clinical response were randomly assigned to continue fluoxetine or to switch to placebo for 52 weeks or until relapse. Residual sleep disturbance during the baseline visit of the double-blind phase was assessed using items 4, 5, 6 (insomnia) and 22, 23, 24 (hypersomnia) of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Survival analysis was utilized to determine the effect of residual sleep disturbance on risk of relapse. Results The severities of early (P > 0. 05), middle (P > 0. 05), late (P > 0. 05), or total (P > 0. 05) residual insomnia were not found to significantly <b>predict</b> <b>risk</b> of relapse during continuation and maintenance-phase treatment.

Residual sleep disturbance during the baseline visit of the double-blind phase was assessed using items 4, 5, 6 (insomnia) and 22, 23, 24 (hypersomnia) of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Survival analysis was utilized to determine the effect of residual sleep disturbance on risk of relapse. Results: The severities of early (P > 0. 05), middle (P > 0. 05), late (P > 0. 05), or total (P > 0. 05) residual insomnia were not found to significantly <b>predict</b> <b>risk</b> of relapse during continuation and maintenance-phase treatment. Similarly, the severities of early bedtime (P > 0. 05), oversleeping (P > 0. 05), napping (P > 0. 05), or total (P > 0. 05) residual hypersomnia were not found to significantly <b>predict</b> <b>risk</b> of relapse during continuation and maintenance-phase treatment. Conclusion: The present study did not identify the severity of residual sleep disturbance among fluoxetine responders to <b>predict</b> <b>risk</b> of MDD relapse. The size of our sample may have precluded us from identifying more modest effects of residual sleep disturbance on the risk of relapse in MDD patients. Future studies are needed to further explore the relationship between residual sleep disturbance and relapse in MDD. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT 0042712...|$|R
