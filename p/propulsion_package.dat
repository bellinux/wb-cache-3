This design maximizes the cargo carrying capacity of the vessel and situates the prime mover close to the propeller, minimizing equipment cost and problems posed from long shaft lines. The engine room on some ships may be situated mid-ship, especially on vessels built from 1900 to the 1960s.

40|$|The {{application}} of advanced and emerging technologies to a fighter aircraft concept is described. The twin-boom fighter (TBF- 1) {{relies on a}} two dimensional vectoring/reversing nozzle to provide STOL performance while also achieving efficient long range supersonic cruise. A key feature is that the <b>propulsion</b> <b>package</b> is placed so that the nozzle hinge line is near the aircraft center-of-gravity to allow large vector angles and, thus, provide large values of direct lift while minimizing the moments to be trimmed. The configurations name {{is derived from the}} long twin booms extending aft of the engine to the twin vertical tails which have a single horizontal tail mounted atop and between them. Technologies utilized were an advanced engine (1985 state-of-the-art), superplastic formed/diffusion bonded titanium structure, advanced controls/avionics/displays, supersonic wing design, and conformal weapons carriage. The integration of advanced technologies into this concept indicate that large gains in takeoff and landing performance, maneuver, acceleration, supersonic cruise speed, and range can be acieved relative to current fighter concepts...|$|E
40|$|The envisioned MKV package {{design for}} this {{particular}} research project will include 20 – 40 MKVs each {{about the size of}} a softball and weighing less then one kilogram. The MKVs will serve as missile interception defense from foreign attacks, including seek and destroy capabilities. The primary component of this kill vehicle is the DACS (Divert and Attitude Control System) —the <b>propulsion</b> <b>package</b> that not only gives the vehicle maneuvering capability for the intercept but also keeps it balanced. The size constraints of the spacecraft, however, allow for only short chamber lengths that are not agreeable with today 2 ̆ 7 s industry mixing requirement standards, therefore a new more robust fuel injection system is tested for the MKV package. Three coaxial swirl injectors are tested, each with different geometrical orifice configurations. The primary focus of this paper is concerned with the cold flow testing results followed by a brief discussion of hot fire testing. These injectors are tested at different pressures and analyzed with the use of tools such as the Particle Image Velocimeter, shadowgraph and thermal imaging camera.

40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} presented, of {{measurements}} of thrust (T) and specific impulse (Isp), {{produced by a}} single emitter prototype colloid propulsion system. The development of the colloid thruster <b>propulsion</b> <b>package</b> at Stanford University is in preparation for flight-testing on a 20 -kg university nanosatellite, to be launched in 2003. The half-kilogram Colloid Micro Thruster (CMT) package measures 10 cm x 10 cm x 20 cm, consumes 6 watts of maximum power for all on-board functions (including power processing, and microprocessor control system), and stores and provides controlled delivery of 10 ml of 2. 0 M sodium-iodide/glycerol propellant to the emission source. The prototype unit tested here is highly modular, to allow testing of multiple thruster “core ” designs. Here {{we report on the}} performance of a single-emitter core, consisting of a 150 µm OD / 75 µm ID stainless-steel capillary needle charged to as high as 6 kV relative to the extractor which is maintained at spacecraft ground potential. The measured emission current is found to be exponentially dependent on the applied acceleration voltage, placing it outside of regimes studied previously. Performance mapping, carried out by two indirect methods of determining T and Isp (from steady-state measurements of current and mass flow, and from time-of flight measurements) indicates operation at a level of Isp = 200 sec and T = 4 µN – somewhat below design targets, due largely to the relatively low applied voltage used (~ 4. 5 kV). A discussion is presented about interesting dynamical behavior seen at emission onset, when current "bursts " are observed...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted {{to determine the effects}} of several variations in body shape on the aerodynamic characteristics of an all-body hypersonic aircraft configuration. The basic configuration had a delta planform with an elliptic cone forebody and an afterbody of elliptic cross section terminating in a straight-line trailing edge. Variations in body shape included the ratio of maximum cross-sectional to body planform area, body leading-edge sweep, and forebody length ratio. In addition, the effects of a thin wing mounted on one of the bodies was investigated, and the aerodynamic characteristics of just the forebodies of two of the configurations were determined. The models had no stabilizing surfaces or <b>propulsion</b> system <b>packages.</b> Ranges of angle of attack (- 4 deg to + 15 deg) and angle of sideslip (- 4 deg to + 8 deg) were investigated. Of the four complete bodies, the configuration with the lowest ratio of cross-sectional to body planform area had the highest maximum lift-drag ratio and the greatest level of longitudinal stability at most Mach numbers. All the configurations had positive longitudinal stability near maximum lift-drag ratio at most Mach numbers. With exception of the lowest subsonic Mach numbers, changes in body sweep angle and in forebody length ratio had only minor effects on maximum lift-drag ratio...|$|R
50|$|The Gernsback's {{transition}} to sole Muscle <b>Package</b> <b>propulsion</b> vastly increased the power-to-weight ratio. For comparison, the palladium reactor on an M9 Gernsback is rated at 3,300 hp (2,500 kW) {{in comparison to}} the 1,200 hp (890 kW) of the Rk-92 Savage diesel generator. At the same time, an M9 only weighs 70-80% as much as a Rk-92, depending on weapons loadout. With an output more comparable to a jet aircraft, the M9 is capable of punishing maneuvers that can easily injure, disable or kill the pilot. Use of the ECS combined with the very quiet operation of the palladium reactor and the Muscle Package renders the M9 extremely difficult to detect. It is often said that the Arm Slave has reached the man-machine limit, and cannot be improved in mobility. The increased power is instead used to increase the payload capacity of the craft without affecting combat effectiveness.|$|R
50|$|Further {{modifications}} {{were made}} in the late 1950s. As the Standards were nearing the end of their useful service life, the New York City Transit Authority set up a plan to retire the cars {{by the end of the}} 1960s. Trailers were to be retired first, in the early part of the 1960s. This was a matter of practicality since all trailer cars in the New York City Subway were being phased out. Motor cars would be retired next, starting with the oldest cars (cars 2000-2299, along with a few 2300's). The rest of the fleet would need to serve longer until new car orders could replace them, so cars 2400-2799 were to receive a light overhaul to allow them to serve through the 1960s. Car 2899 was also overhauled, as it was part of a three-car set with two cars (2700's) that fell within the scope of the program. Cars 2800-2898 were not overhauled as they had a non-standard group box switch. The remaining 2300's and the 2800's were retired during the mid-1960s; and the overhauled cars continued in service until the last train operated on August 4, 1969, in Myrtle-Chambers service.. Overhauled cars received sealed beam headlights to illuminate tunnels. In addition, their interiors were revitalized with new light fixtures and seat cushions. Overhauled cars also received a more modern General Electric <b>propulsion</b> control <b>package</b> during this time, which was believed by the Transit Authority to be an upgrade over the older Westinghouse packages. About half the overhauled cars were so equipped.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this work}} the {{activity}} of study deals with the preliminary design of a measuring instrumentation system consisting of two parts: an electric <b>propulsion</b> diagnostics <b>package,</b> and an active plasma diagnostics package. This system must perform the measurements in the cosmic space to achieve the following goals of the SPES mission (SPES, Space Plasma Experiment Satellite) : a) Accomplish a set of active plasmas physics experiments involving magnetized streaming plasmas; b) Demonstrate in-flight performance and operation capability of the 100 Watt Hall effect thruster (HT – 100), produced by Alta SpA; c) Collect data on the Van Allen belts environment effects on solar cells and electronic components. This thesis begins introducing the mission outline, the problems related to the space environment hardness and disclosing some {{ideas about how to}} achieve the mission goals. This work has been developed essentially in three steps: 1. Search and review of papers on plasma diagnostics and instruments which are available to achieve the mission objectives; for each instrument: architecture, physical principle of its functioning, and performances have been analyzed. 2. Diagnostics system design; a selection of instruments to form instruments packages, which are capable to achieve the mission objectives respecting its constraints, has been made; for each diagnostics package at least a plausible geometric configuration has been designed. 3. Selection between the diagnostics packages configurations; the final choice of diagnostic system has been made on the basis of: performances, reliability and low cost criteria. All along this work emphasis was put on the instruments for the diagnostics of interaction between plasma thrusters and spacecraft. So this work presents some background reading about plasma physics and what the current practice is in terms of plume - spacecraft interactions and performance diagnostics. Moreover an approach to the problems of satellite subsystems electromagnetic compatibility has been made: electromagnetic interference, and electrostatic discharge. Then a quick review of methods, techniques and experimental setups, used to tackle this problem, has been made from reference papers...|$|R
40|$|The Solid Rocket <b>Propulsion</b> (SRP) {{software}} <b>package</b> developed within DLR Bremen is {{utilized for}} modeling and optimizing three dimensional solid rocket motors. As {{part of the}} computation process, a conceptual 3 D geometrical representation of the motor is created. However, this geometry has so far existed solely {{as a set of}} parameters in a text based file. This study thus aims to create an additional program module, written in object oriented Fortran 2003 that can convert the text file containing arbitrary SRP geometries into three dimensional models following the VRML 2. 0 format. A central part of the study is the development and verification of novel mathematical equations for converting cylindrical and star propellant grain cross sections into Cartesian coordinates. These equations are incorporated into the resulting program module. The program then utilizes an existing meshing tool named GGH to generate the VRML 2. 0 compliant input files from the given Cartesian coordinates. These input files can be opened through any VRML compliant viewers or imported into CAD programs such as CATIA. In conclusion, the program module was successfully developed with all core requirements fulfilled. Thorough documentations of the source code and user instructions have been created and a potential future development direction of the program has been identified...|$|R
40|$|The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is NASA's lead {{center for}} robotic {{exploration}} {{of our solar}} system. We are known for our large, flagship missions, such as Voyager, which gave humanity its first close look at Jupiter and Saturn; and the Mars Rovers, which have excited millions worldwide with their daring landing exploits. Less familiar to those outside NASA may be our role in developing the Kepler mission, which has discovered more than 2000 planets around other stars; or the recently launched Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, one of many JPL Earth Science missions. A recent JPL initiative has emphasized low cost missions that use rapidly evolving technology developed for CubeSats and NanoSat s to explore our solar system. Costs are significantly lower (by one or two orders of magnitude) than for conventional JPL missions, and development time is also significantly shorter. At present 21 such CubeSat flight projects are under way at the laboratory with various partners : some in flight, some in development, some in advanced formulation. Four are planned as deep space missions. To succeed in exploring deep space CubeSat/NanoSat missions have to address several challenges: the more severe radiation environment, communications and navigation at a distance, <b>propulsion,</b> and <b>packaging</b> of instruments that can return valuable science into a compact volume/mass envelope. Instrument technologies, including cameras, magnetometers, spectrometers, radiometers, and even radars are undergoing miniaturization to fit on these smaller platforms. Other key technologies are being matured for smallsats and NanoSats in deep space, including micro -electric propulsion, compact radio (and optical) communications, and onboard data reduction. This paper will describe missions that utilize these developments including the first two deep space CubeSats (INSPIRE), planned for launch in 2017; the first pair of CubeSats {{to be sent to}} another planet (MARCO), manifested with the InSight Mars lander launch in March of 2016; a helicopter "drone" on Mars to extend the reach of future rovers; plans for a Lunar Flashlight mission to shine a light on the permanently shadowed craters of the Moon's poles; a Near Earth Asteroid CubeSat missio n; and a CubeSat constellation to demonstrate time series measurements of storm systems on Earth. From these beginnings, the potential for CubeSats and NanoSats to add to our knowledge of the solar system could easily grow exponentially. Imagine if every deep space mission carried one or more CubeSats that could operate independently (even for a brief period) on arrival at their target body. At only incremental additional cost, such spacecraft could go closer, probe deeper, and provide science measurements that we would not risk with the host spacecraft. This paper will describe examples including a NanoSat to probe the composition of Venus' atmosphere, impactors and close flybys of Europa, lunar probes, and soft landers for the moons of Mars. Low cost access to deep space also offers the potential for independent CubeSat/NanoSat missions - allowing us to characterize the population of near Earth asteroids for example, deploy a constellation around Venus, or take closer looks at the asteroid belt...|$|R
40|$|The Mars Design Reference Architecture (DRA) 5. 0 {{explored}} a piloted Mars {{mission in}} the 2030 timeframe, focusing on architecture and technology choices. The DRA 5. 0 focused on nuclear thermal and cryogenic chemical propulsion system options for the mission. Follow-on work explored both nuclear and solar electric options. One enticing option that {{was found in a}} NASA Collaborative Modeling for Parametric Assessment of Space Systems (COMPASS) design study used a combination of a 1 -MW-class solar electric propulsion (SEP) system combined with storable chemical systems derived from the planned Orion crew vehicle. It was found that by using each propulsion system at the appropriate phase of the mission, the entire SEP stage and habitat could be placed into orbit with just two planned Space Launch System (SLS) heavy lift launch vehicles assuming the crew would meet up at the Earth-Moon (E-M) L 2 point on a separate heavy-lift launch. These appropriate phases use high-thrust chemical propulsion only in gravity wells when the vehicle is piloted and solar electric propulsion for every other phase. Thus the SEP system performs the spiral of the unmanned vehicle from low Earth orbit (LEO) to E-M L 2 where the vehicle meets up with the multi-purpose crew vehicle. From here SEP is used to place the vehicle on a trajectory to Mars. With SEP providing {{a large portion of the}} required capture and departure changes in velocity (delta V) at Mars, the delta V provided by the chemical propulsion is reduced by a factor of five from what would be needed with chemical propulsion alone at Mars. This trajectory also allows the SEP and habitat vehicle to arrive in the highly elliptic 1 -sol parking orbit compatible with envisioned Mars landing concepts. This paper explores mission options using between SEP and chemical propulsion, the design of the SEP system including the solar array and electric <b>propulsion</b> systems, and <b>packaging</b> in the SLS shroud.
