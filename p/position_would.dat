5|$|After eleven players {{left the}} club in 2014, Adams rebuilt for the 2014–15 {{campaign}} by signing left-sided player Colin Daniel, Northern Ireland internationals Ryan McGivern and Michael O'Connor, pacey winger Mark Marshall, Crewe Alexandra attacker Byron Moore, veteran midfielder Michael Brown, and midfielder Steve Jennings, and also took in three loanees in Swiss full-back Freddie Veseli, highly rated striker Jordan Slew and French target man Achille Campion. Defeat to local rivals Crewe Alexandra marked the club's fifth consecutive loss, and after the game Adams accepted that his <b>position</b> <b>would</b> be under threat if results did not turn around quickly. Following six straight defeats Adams resigned as manager on 18 September after lengthy discussions with the chairman.|$|E
5|$|In {{internal}} politics {{he attempted}} to strengthen {{the power of the}} monarchy, but this was mostly thwarted by the szlachta, who valued their independence and democratic powers. Władysław suffered continuing difficulties caused by the efforts of the Polish Sejm (parliament) to check the King's power and limit his dynastic ambitions. Władysław was fed up with the weak position of the king in the Commonwealth; his politics included attempting to secure a small, preferably hereditary territory – like a duchy – where his <b>position</b> <b>would</b> be much stronger.|$|E
5|$|It is in {{this period}} that the broch was built. Part of the {{structure}} has been lost to coastal erosion, and modern sea defences have been erected. The tower was probably originally 13metres (40feet) or more high and as with many broch sites the <b>position</b> <b>would</b> have commanded fine views of the surrounding seas. During this period archaeological sites in Shetland usually exhibit defensive fortifications of some kind, and Jarlshof is no exception. An outer defensive wall associated with the broch contained a substantial (although rather poorly constructed) house and byre at one time. This wall was utilised at a later stage to build a large roundhouse {{in the lee of}} the broch.|$|E

5|$|On the ground, Taylor's {{offensive}} scrambling, while effective, was not Virginia Tech's primary rushing weapon. Running back Brandon Ore, Virginia Tech's starter at the <b>position,</b> <b>would</b> {{need to have}} a good game, analysts predicted, if the Hokies {{wanted to}} win the game. Ore, who suffered several injuries during the 2006 season, failed to produce meaningful offensive yardage until late in the season, disappointing many fans who hoped he would repeat his excellent 2006performance on the field. With a 146-yard performance against Virginia in the final game of the regular season, Ore seemed to have regained his 2006form and promised success in the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{thought so}} highly of Williams that in 1792, when Daniel Morgan refused {{the rank of}} Brigadier General of the American Army, the {{president}} had Henry Knox, the United States Secretary of War, write Williams asking him to accept the position. The <b>position</b> <b>would</b> have made Williams the second {{in command of the}} American Army, but citing poor health and no ambition for the position, Williams declined the appointment. However, on December 21, 1792, Williams accepted the Maryland State Legislature's invitation for him to serve as an Associate Justice for Baltimore County.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} the posting as drugs adviser, Penfold was keen {{to go back to}} Africa. He applied for a post as high {{commissioner}} in Namibia, but the post was downgraded and the application fell through. Penfold was then offered a posting to Sierra Leone. Although it was a lower-ranking post than the British Virgin Islands, Penfold was assured that taking the <b>position</b> <b>would</b> not adversely affect his career, so he accepted and, in March 1997, was appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone. He later stated that he believed his previous experience in Africa, particularly in Uganda, stood him in good stead for the events of his posting to Sierra Leone. The country {{was in the middle of}} a bloody civil war in 1997, and on 25 May—six weeks into Penfold's tenure—President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's government was overthrown in a military coup. Although the coup itself did not come as a surprise, the timing caught the international community off-guard. As in Uganda a decade earlier, Penfold gathered all the high commission staff and their families under one roof.|$|E

5|$|Because he owed few favors to the state's {{established}} politicians, many of Brown's top appointees were businesspeople. Keeping {{a campaign}} promise {{to appoint a}} woman and an African-American to his cabinet, Brown named William E. McAnulty Jr., and Jacqueline Swigart to his cabinet. McAnulty resigned his post {{as secretary of the}} state's Department of Justice within one month, saying the <b>position</b> <b>would</b> keep him from spending enough time with his family. Brown re-appointed McAnulty to his former position as a judge with the Jefferson County District Court and replaced him with another African-American, George W. Wilson. He also appointed Viola Davis Brown as Executive Director of the Office of Public Health Nursing – in 1980, she was the first African-American nurse to lead a state office of public health nursing in the U.S. His most controversial appointment was Frank Metts, his secretary of transportation. Metts broke with political tradition in Kentucky, announcing that contracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bids and performance rather than political patronage. Despite cutting personnel from the department, Metts doubled the miles of road that were resurfaced.|$|E
5|$|For much of Chinese history, the {{position}} of Emperor was determined by primogeniture; the <b>position</b> <b>would</b> pass from father to first-born son upon the father's death. While Khitan succession was also kept within families, an {{emphasis was placed on}} selecting the most capable option, with all of a leader's brothers, nephews, and sons considered valid choices for succession. Khitan rulers were expected to hand over power to a paternal relative after serving a single three-year term. Abaoji signaled his desire to become a permanent ruler at his accession in 907, securing his position by killing most of the other Khitan chieftains. Between 907 and 910 Abaoji's rule went unchallenged. It was only after 910, when Abaoji disregarded the Khitan tradition that another member of the family assume {{the position}} of Great Khan, that his rule came under direct challenge. In both 912 and 913 members of Abaoji's family, including most of his brothers, attempted armed insurrections. After the first insurrection was discovered and defeated, Abaoji pardoned the conspirators. After the second, only his brothers were pardoned, with the other conspirators suffering violent deaths. The brothers plotted additional rebellions in 917 and 918, both of which were easily crushed.|$|E
5|$|Further tragedy soon {{followed}} when Victoria's son, George, died of bone cancer the following year. Her granddaughter, Lady Pamela Hicks, remembered her grandmother's tears. In World War II Victoria was bombed out of Kensington Palace, and {{spent some time}} at Windsor Castle with King George VI. Her surviving son, Louis, and two of her grandsons served in the Royal Navy, while her German relations fought with the opposing forces. She {{spent most of her}} time reading and worrying about her children; her daughter, Alice, remained in occupied Greece and was unable to communicate with her mother for four years {{at the height of the}} war. After the Allied victory, her son, Louis, was offered the post of Viceroy of India, but she was deeply opposed to his accepting, knowing that the <b>position</b> <b>would</b> be dangerous and difficult. He accepted anyway.|$|E

5|$|In the Lord High Steward's Court, a {{group of}} Lords Triers, sitting under the {{chairmanship}} of the Lord High Steward, acted as judge and jury. By custom the number of Triers was not fewer than 23, so that a majority was a minimum of 12, but in fact the number ranged from 20 to 35. The power to choose which peers served as Triers lay with the Crown and was sometimes subject to abuse, as only those peers who agreed with the monarch's <b>position</b> <b>would</b> be summoned to the Court of the Lord High Steward, thereby favouring the desired verdict. This practice was ended by the Treason Act 1695, passed during the reign of King William III. The Act required that all peers be summoned as Triers. All subsequent trials were held before the full House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Remaining {{in such a}} <b>position</b> <b>would</b> require Mercedes-Benz {{to produce}} a {{competitive}} car for the 1936 season. Although the chassis of the W25 was shortened, and the engine was significantly upgraded to 4.74litres, the car proved inferior to the Type C developed by Auto Union. Mercedes had not improved the chassis to match the engine, and the W25 proved uncompetitive and unreliable. Despite this, Caracciola opened {{the season with a}} win in the rain at the Monaco Grand Prix, after starting from third position. He led the Hungarian Grand Prix early but retired with mechanical problems. At the German Grand Prix, he retired with a failed fuel pump, before taking over his teammate Hermann Lang's car; he later retired that car with supercharger problems. Caracciola led the Swiss Grand Prix for several laps, Rosemeyer trailing him closely, but the Clerk of the Course ordered Caracciola to cede the lead to Rosemeyer on the ninth lap after he was found to be blocking the Auto Union. The two had a heated argument after the race despite Caracciola's later retirement with a rear axle problem. Mercedes were so uncompetitive in 1936—Caracciola won only twice, in Monaco and Tunis—that Neubauer withdrew the team mid-season, leaving Rosemeyer to take the Championship for Auto Union.|$|E
5|$|The Sandomierz {{articles}} {{produced by}} the rebels were concerned mostly with placing further limitations on the monarch's power. Threatened by royal forces under Stanisław Żółkiewski, the confederates entered into an agreement with Sigismund, but then backed {{out of it and}} demanded the King's deposition. The ensuing civil war was resolved at the Battle of Guzów, where the szlachta was defeated in 1607. Afterwards however magnate leaders of the pro-King faction made sure that Sigismund's <b>position</b> <b>would</b> remain precarious, leaving arbitration powers within the Senate's competence. Whatever was left of the execution movement had become thwarted together with the obstructionist szlachta elements, and a compromise solution to the crisis of authority was arrived at. But the victorious lords of the council had at their disposal no effective political machinery necessary to propagate the well-being of the Commonwealth, still in its Golden Age (or as some prefer Silver Age now), much further.|$|E

40|$|The {{glass ceiling}} {{is one of}} the most {{controversial}} and emotive aspects of employment in organisations. This paper provides a model of the glass ceiling that exhibits the following features that are frequently thought to characterise the problem: (i) there is a lower number of female employees in higher positions, (ii) women have to work harder than men to obtain equivalent jobs, (iii) women are then paid less than men when promoted, and (iv) some organisations are more female friendly than others. These features emerge as an equilibrium phenomenon, when identical firms compete in "Bertrand-like" fashion. Furthermore, they also occur even when offering women the same contract as men in higher <b>positions</b> <b>would</b> be sufficient to ensure that women in those <b>positions</b> <b>would</b> always prefer permanent career over non-market alternatives.

5|$|The same year, Grant {{acquired}} a slave from his father-in-law, a thirty-five-year-old man named William Jones. In March 1859, Grant freed William, worth about $1,500, instead of selling {{him at a}} time when he desperately needed money. Grant moved to St. Louis, taking on a partnership with Julia's cousin Harry Boggs working in real estate business as a bill collector, again without success, and at Julia's recommendation dissolved his partnership. In August, Grant applied for a position as county engineer, believing his education qualified him for the job. His application came with thirty-five notable recommendations, but Grant correctly assumed the <b>position</b> <b>would</b> be given on the basis of political affiliation and was passed over as he was believed to share his father-in-law's Democratic sentiments. In April 1860, Grant and his family moved north to Galena, accepting a position in his father's leather goods business run by his younger brothers Simpson and Orvil. In a few months, Ulysses paid off the debts he acquired in Missouri. Ulysses and family attended the local Methodist church and he soon established himself as a reputable citizen of Galena.|$|E
5|$|The top 35 {{drivers were}} {{assigned}} to Gatorade Duel races based upon their qualifying positions in the Daytona 500.

Competitors who qualified in even-numbered places took part in the second Duel. The drivers' finishing positions in both Duels determined their starting positions in the Daytona 500. Positions 40 to 42 were filled with the quickest drivers who did not qualify in the top 35. 43rd place was occupied by an eligible past champion. In the event a past champion was not available, the 43rd <b>position</b> <b>would</b> be filled by the next-fastest driver. Two drivers outside the top 35 were eligible for two transfer spots in each Duel which allowed them to qualify for the Daytona 500.|$|E
5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it imperative to attack. Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive <b>position</b> <b>would</b> have made little sense for the Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps they were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E
