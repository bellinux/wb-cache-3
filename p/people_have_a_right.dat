Property could not be taken for public use without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives. If accused, a person had the right to a speedy and local trial, based on an accusation made known to him, with the right to call for evidence and witnesses in his favor.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the {{euthanasia}} {{debate has}} {{tended to focus on}} a number of key concerns. According to euthanasia opponent Ezekiel Emanuel, proponents of euthanasia have presented four main arguments: a) that <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to self-determination, and thus should be allowed to choose their own fate; b) assisting a subject to die might be a better choice than requiring that they continue to suffer; c) the distinction between passive euthanasia, which is often permitted, and active euthanasia, which is not substantive (or that the underlying principle–the doctrine of double effect–is unreasonable or unsound); and d) permitting euthanasia will not necessarily lead to unacceptable consequences. Pro-euthanasia activists often point to countries like the Netherlands and Belgium, and states like Oregon, where euthanasia has been legalized, to argue that it is mostly unproblematic.|$|E

25|$|In October 1980, {{the dozen}} or so {{erstwhile}} nuns held their first fundraiser, a bingo game and Salsa dance that was well-attended {{in large part because of}} the write-up in The San Francisco Chronicle by Herb Caen the same day, who printed their organization name, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. The benefit was for San Francisco's Metropolitan Community Church Cuban Refugee Program, and it netted $1,500 ($ in 2009). The Sisters began making regular appearances at Castro events that focused on sexual tolerance or provided a showcase for drag. They also developed a mission statement:The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence is a leading-edge Order of queer nuns. Since our first appearance in San Francisco on Easter Sunday, 1979, the Sisters have devoted ourselves to community service, ministry and outreach to those on the edges, and to promoting human rights, respect for diversity and spiritual enlightenment.

Describing his philosophical views, Zappa stated, [...] "I believe that <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to decide their own destinies; people own themselves. I also believe that, in a democracy, government exists because (and only so long as) individual citizens give it a 'temporary license to exist'—in exchange for a promise that it will behave itself.

500|$|The Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{conducted}} an internal {{review of the}} agency's pre-9/11 performance and was harshly critical of senior CIA officials for not doing everything possible to confront terrorism. He criticized their failure to stop two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, {{as they entered the}} United States and their failure to share information on the two men with the FBI. In May 2007, senators from both major U.S. political parties drafted legislation to make the review public.

500|$|According to the Church, <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> {{to private}} property. However, {{ownership}} makes that person [...] "a steward" [...] {{who is expected}} to make it [...] "fruitful" [...] or profitable in a way that benefits others after that person has first taken care of their family. Private property and the common good are seen as complementary elements that exist for the purpose of strengthening society. The taking of another's private property [...] "in obvious and urgent necessity" [...] as [...] "the only way to provide for immediate, essential needs (food, shelter, clothing)" [...] is not considered by the Church to be stealing. The concept of slavery as private property is condemned by the Church, which classifies it as the stealing of a person's human rights.|$|E

[...] To Locke, one's own body was part of one's property, and thus one's right to property would theoretically guarantee safety for one's person, as well as one's possessions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{nationalism}} {{was based on}} the idea of a people who shared a common bond through race, religion, language and culture. Furthermore, nationalism asserted that each <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to its own nation.

5000|$|The Labour Government did {{not support}} {{independence}} and their general election manifesto gave no commitment to introduce bills to provide for self-government, except for India. The Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, justified this by saying {{the loss of the}} colonies would mean falling living standards for British people. Continued colonial rule was in contradiction to the Atlantic Charter, agreed between the UK and USA to provide a blueprint for the world after World War II and which stated that [...] "All <b>peoples</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to self-determination".|$|R
2500|$|Political {{proponents of}} the law intend it to address cases where gay, lesbian, bisexual, and {{transgender}} employees have been discriminated against by their employers because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Currently, these employees are unable to find protection in the courts because sexual orientation is {{not considered to be}} a suspect class by the federal courts and by many U.S. states. Proponents argue that such a law is appropriate in light of the United States Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and due process to all. Advocates argue that homosexuality is not a [...] "choice" [...] but a personal identity, a claim supported by the American Psychology Association (APA), and that all working <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to be judged by the quality of their work performance and not by completely unrelated factors. According to a study published in 2001 by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, reports of discrimination based on sexual orientation are roughly equal to those on race or gender. The APA also states that there is significant discrimination against homosexuals in the workforce.|$|E
2500|$|By May 19, rumors {{were still}} being spread. Many people {{believed}} that the slayer had been caught. Some of them believed he was being held at the Bowie County Jail surrounded by Texas Rangers with submachine guns on their knees. Others believed he was flown to an out-of-town jail. The Gazette and News offices were drowned with phone calls, both local and long distance, inquiring about the apprehension of the killer. [...] "Newspapers Will Tell Public If Killer Is Caught", read one of the sub-headlines of the May 19th edition of Texarkana Gazette. Sheriff Presley declared that innocent people were being accused of being the Phantom and asked the residents to show more consideration for their fellow citizens. Presley stated, [...] "These rumors positively are not true. We can understand why the people believe them. All of us are tense and are hopeful that at any hour officers will announce they have the killer in custody. The people must not become so anxious to rid themselves of the killer, however, that they brand innocent persons as the murderer and believe unfounded stories. The investigating officers have announced that when and if the killer is apprehended or killed the public will be given the full story through the newspapers. We reaffirm this statement. The newspapers are kept posted on developments in the investigation and they will announce all news immediately. We believe that the <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> {{to know if the}} killer is caught or killed and we pledge ourselves to let the public have this information." ...|$|E
2500|$|Enlightenment {{philosophers}} {{are given}} credit for shaping liberal ideas. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized as a distinct ideology, by the English philosopher John Locke, generally regarded {{as the father of}} modern liberalism. Thomas Hobbes attempted to determine the purpose and the justification of governing authority in a post-civil war England. Employing the idea of a state of nature – a hypothetical war-like scenario prior to the State – he constructed the idea of a social contract that individuals enter into to guarantee their security and in so doing form the State, concluding that only an absolute sovereign would be fully able to sustain such a peace. Hobbes had developed the concept of the social contract, according to which, individuals in the anarchic and brutal state of nature came together and voluntarily ceded some of their individual rights to an established state authority, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Whereas Hobbes advocated a strong monarchical authority (the Leviathan), Locke developed the then radical notion that government acquires consent from the governed which has to be constantly present for the government to remain legitimate. John Locke, while adopting Hobbes's idea of a state of nature and social contract, nevertheless argued that when the monarch becomes a tyrant, that constituted a violation of the social contract, which bestows life, liberty and property as a natural right. He concluded that the <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to overthrow a tyrant. By placing life, liberty and property as the supreme value of law and authority, Locke formulated the basis of liberalism based on social contract theory. To these early enlightenment thinkers, securing the most essential amenities of life – liberty and private property among them – required the formation of a [...] "sovereign" [...] authority with universal jurisdiction.|$|E

[...] Knox’s own political thinking was liberal, but he, according to Hammons, [...] "didn't believe in party politics ... and thought <b>people</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to vote how they chose, and didn't necessarily need to follow a party line." ...|$|R

This doesn't mean that I want America to become Asian.
