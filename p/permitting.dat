40|$|We {{present a}} novel benefit of linking {{emission}} <b>permit</b> markets. We consider a dynamic setting, {{and let the}} countries issue <b>permits</b> non-cooperatively. With exogenous technology levels, there are only gains from <b>permit</b> trade if countries are different. With endogenous technology, however, we show that there are gains from trade even if countries are identical. In this case, linking the <b>permit</b> markets of different countries will turn <b>permit</b> issuance into intertemporal strategic complements: If one country issues fewer <b>permits</b> today, other countries will respond by issuing fewer <b>permits</b> in the future. This happens because issuing fewer <b>permits</b> today increases current investments in green energy capacity in all <b>permit</b> market countries, and countries with a higher green energy capacity will respond by issuing fewer <b>permits</b> in the future. Hence, each country faces incentives to withhold emission <b>permits.</b> Even though countries cannot commit to reducing their own emission, or punish other countries that do not, the outcome is reduced emissions, higher investments, and increased welfare, compared to a benchmark with only domestic <b>permit</b> trade. The more frequently participating countries reset their caps, the higher the gain from linking <b>permit</b> markers...|$|R
