25|$|Today, only 51% of the Deerwood {{residents}} {{are members of}} the Country Club. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> financial; the equity initiation fee was $21,000 in 2005, with monthly dues of $349 for a golf membership. However, there are about 100 non-residents who are Deerwood Country Club members. When the Deerwood Board of Governors made the decision to build a new clubhouse and renovate the golf course at a cost estimated at $9.5 million, all Equity members were assessed a fee to pay for it. Membership dropped from 700 in 2000 to approximately 500 in January 2004, when the project began. Approximately 25% of the members did not pay it, leaving the club with a $6M debt.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to continued Scouting activities, Coker {{has been involved}} in supporting ex–POWs for many years. In December 2004, he was elected Commander of his local POW chapter, the Tidewater ex-POW Association. In 2008, he was also serving as the head of a Virginia state ex–POW association. Coker and his wife are also active in church and civic activities, such as counseling young married couples. Coker still has nightmares from his time as a POW. Reflecting on his wartime experiences in a Veterans Day tribute to POWs, he said [...] "If you're never tested, you don't know...You're capable of a great deal more than you realize, if you really set your mind to it. Look at me. I did it, and there's nothing special about me. I'm just another guy."

It's getting close to time. Whatever he chooses to do will inform who he is the rest of his life." [...] After their sexual encounter occurred onscreen, Knight {{said in an interview with}} Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune: [...] "George wasn't really paying full attention. He was letting his own feelings override his respect for Meredith. A person really clued in would get that there wasn't anything coming back, but he was so in his head about it and caught up in his own feelings that he wasn't listening. It's not just that he loves her...it's a kind of selfish love he had for her."

500|$|During {{the first}} stages of development, the designers' {{priority}} was purely on streamlining and polishing the shooting aspects; RPG elements were not added until {{this process was}} complete. According to lead designer Christina Norman, [...] "we wanted more satisfying combat and a big <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> making weapons more accurate and powerful at level one—basically saying 'let's take the RPG out of the shooter.'" [...] Since BioWare had no experience with shooter games, the team spent roughly three months tuning how combat would work using the original Mass Effect as a basis. The camera was improved to offer a more precise aiming that included body-specific targeting like headshots. Norman explained that they wanted the weapons {{to have their own}} identity, noting that the final build of the game has 19 weapons with 108 tuning variables. The inclusion of limited ammunition was not initially part of the main game design and was simply implemented for some early playtesting. However, the developers ultimately felt it improved the tension and pacing of combat. The pacing of the story was also improved, especially in the opening, as developers wanted to get players into the action faster.|$|E

[...] Miller continued that he was [...] "past the point of fighting" [...] discussions of how [...] "arty or brainy" [...] he was, but had hoped for greater emphasis [...] "on what the songs are about—be it the boy-girl situation, or being depressed about some key failure I've had, or getting a little bit of understanding about life." [...] In another 1993 interview, Miller mused:I don't think I'm in danger of making albums that don't age well, because I haven't ever fit into the times spectacularly well. I've always been aware of myself drawing on a musical vocabulary so broad {{that a lot of people}} don't get what I consider to be my real songwriting coups. I think they go right past a lot of people. The bad <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> I probably won't become a big star. But the good part is that I don't think people will find the albums less useful over time. They'll sound as good in 2004 as they will in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011 {{considered}} {{a report by}} a Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group (EPG) panel which asserted that the organisation had lost its relevance and was decaying {{due to the lack}} of a mechanism to censure member countries when they violated human rights or democratic norms. The panel made 106 [...] "urgent" [...] recommendations including the adoption of a Charter of the Commonwealth, the creation of a new commissioner on the rule of law, democracy and human rights to track persistent human rights abuses and allegations of political repression by Commonwealth member states, recommendations for the repeal of laws against homosexuality in 41 Commonwealth states and a ban on forced marriage. The failure to release the report, or accept its recommendations for reforms in the area of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, was decried as a [...] "disgrace" [...] by former British Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a member of the EPG, who told a press conference: [...] "The Commonwealth faces a very significant problem. It's not a problem of hostility or antagonism, it's more of a problem of indifference. Its purpose is being questioned, its relevance is being questioned and <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> because its commitment to enforce the values for which it stands is becoming ambiguous in the eyes of many member states. The Commonwealth is not a private club of the governments or the secretariat. It belongs to the people of the Commonwealth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the {{crossover}} as a whole, Oliver Sava at The A.V. Club {{felt the}} episodes did [...] "admirable work advancing the overarching narrative while maintaining each show's distinct perspective" [...] along with being [...] "a {{hell of a}} lot of fun, and it's significantly expanded the scope of the Arrowverse by bringing in an extraterrestrial enemy... There's an entire universe to explore, and this crossover has opened the door for the CW's DC shows to go cosmic in the future." [...] Ed Gross for Empire stated, [...] ""Invasion" [...] is the proverbial mixed bag. As a crossover, it does an extremely effective job in bringing the characters from four different shows together, the rapport between them feeling natural and oftentimes genuinely funny... The real problem with [...] "Invasion" [...] is that it was intended to be, and was promoted as, a massive adventure, but in reality the whole Dominators storyline was rather underwhelming. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> creative – it would have been better to get a fuller understanding of who these beings really are and how they're able to know the long-term effects of Flashpoint; plus the resolution seems awfully pat... and lacks the resolutionary scope that was expected." [...] Despite some of the criticism, Gross gave the crossover 4 stars out of 5. Collider.com's Allison Keene said, [...] "On the positive side, the interactions among cast members of the four shows – Supergirl, The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow – were as delightful as ever. Though Arrow is often the anchor, The Flash usually sets the tone for the crossovers, and so the other shows incorporate its light-hearted, witty banter and a fast-paced action and editing... But on the negative side, the crossovers can also starkly highlight each show's weaknesses," [...] concluding, [...] "There are things [...] "Invasion!" [...] as a whole did really well, and others it didn't, with each series' strengths and weaknesses being highlighted and tested. But with each new expansion, there are things the shows can learn from, and it remains fun for fans".|$|E
