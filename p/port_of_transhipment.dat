40|$|The urban {{settlement}} at Tell Ras Shamra (ancient Ugarit) formed {{the centre of}} a small polity (c. 2000 sq km) during {{the second part of}} the Late Bronze Age (c. 1350 - 1200 BC) (Fig. 3). Based on the relative amount of pottery from the excavations at Tell Ras Shamra, the island of Cyprus was probably the most favoured trading partner at this point in time, given its importance in the metal trade. By the end of the 14 th c. BC the island had also become a <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>transhipment</b> for products from the Aegean world, including Late Helladic ceramics. Late Bronze Age II at Tell Tweini (Gibala) A fair amount of historical information is available on the borders of the Ugaritic kingdom and the sites belonging to it (e. g. van Soldt 2005). Only a small number of those sites, however, has been the subject of intensive archaeological research (e. g. Minet el-Beidha [ancient Mahadou?] and Ras Ibn Hani [ancient Biruti?]). Surface finds or rescue excavations have collected material from smaller sites within this region (e. g. Qalat Er-Rouss [ancient Attalig?]). Since 1999, the site of Tell Tweini (Jebleh) (Figs 1, 2) is being excavated by a Syro-Belgian team led by Prof. Dr. M. Al-Maqdissi (DGAM) and Prof. Dr. K. Van Lerberghe (KULeuven). The site, which was inhabited at least since the end of the 3 rd mill. BC until the Persian period, was a flourishing harbour town during LB II (Bretschneider et al. 2005). It is very likely that the site may be identified as ancient Gibala which formed the southernmost border of the Ugaritic kingdom (Fig. 4).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The growing {{progression}} {{in the use}} of containers as standardized charge {{unity in}} maritim transport and the tecnological revolution associated to this has involved deep changes in the nature of interport competition. At first, the concept of Hinterland is becoming obsolete because the use of containers provide the intermodality and so remove monopolistic position <b>of</b> <b>ports</b> in his next influence area. Adjoint to this, interport competition is not focused, however, exclusively in enlarging the next influence area and more and more {{it has to do with}} his function <b>of</b> <b>transhipment,</b> that is, attracting the throughput with origin or destination to another port. Shippers organize container througtput by means of Round-The-World services which reasoning lie in using huge ships paying of call in a few strategic ports where transhipments are done from/to <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> origin or destination ports through feeder ships(with a moderate size). The upshot of all that is growing concentration of container througput in a few intermodal launchs and the configuration of a very competitive environment in the regional port systems.

30|$|The {{first and}} most {{conspicuous}} step consists in constructing a revised version of the LSBCI. The underlying raw data is obtained from Lloyds List Intelligence (formally Containerisation International On-line) (“Lloyd’s List Intelligence - Containers,” n.d.). The dataset gives all the existing direct country pair connections and includes inter alia the number of ships sailing in this route, the TEU capacity of the largest vessel per direct route, the number of operators per route (both those who operate their own vessels {{and those who do}} not). The information is obtained annually, in the month of May. The data covers the reported deployment of all containerships at a given point in time. This methodology allows for comparisons over time, as the “sample” is always complete. UNCTAD started the systematic annual gathering of data in 2004 on the country level and in 2006 on the pair-of-country level. In addition to the LSBCI itself and its components which are defined and discussed in detail in next section, two novel variables are retrieved from this data: a variable indicating the number <b>of</b> <b>transhipments</b> necessary to connect any pair of countries and, the effective maritime distance to be covered between any pair of countries. Note that only {{in the case of a}} direct maritime connection, the effective (computed) maritime distance coincides with sea distance. Note also that information on the number <b>of</b> <b>transhipments</b> necessary to connect any pair of countries is symmetric: if two transhipments are necessary to move containers from country C to country D, then the same number <b>of</b> <b>transhipments</b> is necessary to move containers in the opposite direction from D to C.|$|R
40|$|The <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Gdansk {{located at}} the mouth of the Vistula has a {{tradition}} of over a thousand years and is firmly connected with both the Polish and world sea trade. In 1970 s construction of a new deep-water Northern Port was started. The next decade was less favourable when an economical and political crisis adversely affected the size and structure <b>of</b> the <b>port</b> turnovers. A new period for the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Gdansk started after 1989. At present the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Gdansk is the biggest port on the Baltic Sea, capable of servicing ships of "Balti-max" class. The <b>port</b> consists <b>of</b> two parts - the inner port {{located at the}} mouth of the Martwa Wisła (the Dead Vistula) and the outer port - protruding into the sea, modern, deep-water Northern <b>Port</b> capable <b>of</b> servicing ships up to 150 thousand tons of dead-weight capacity and draught up to 15 m. Two specialist transhipment terminals were located here - of coal and liquid fuels (rebuilt in 1998). The second terminal is linked by a system of pipelines with the Refinery of Gdansk, with the Petrochemistry of Płock, with Russia and with refineries in Germany. The size <b>of</b> <b>transhipments</b> in the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Gdansk remained at the level of 16. 5 - 20. 5 m tons in 1995 - 1999. It is not much in comparison with <b>transhipment</b> capacity <b>of</b> the <b>port</b> that is 55 m tons. Through the ferry terminal of PZB (Polska Żegluga Bałtycka - Polish Baltic Navigation) pass yearly from 97 thousand to 125 thousand passengers. Regular sailing lines link the <b>port</b> with <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> Sweden, Germany, Great Britain, Turkey, Egypt, the Red Sea, India Sea and the Caribbean. A forecast for <b>transhipment</b> turnovers <b>of</b> the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Gdansk until 2010 assumes two variants. A pessimistic variant takes, among others, an assumption of maintaining the land character of trade exchange of Poland and lack of development for transport links between the port and the hinterland An optimistic variant forecasts a favourable pace of the country's economic growth, a high increase in turnovers of the Polish foreign trade, especially in exports. An increase in competitiveness, a development of all fields of activity in the port, a full use <b>of</b> the <b>port</b> space, and improvement of transport links with the hinterland - all this will substantially affect an increase in transhipment turnovers. Important advantages to achieve such assumptions are proper bathymetric conditions and free terrain in the outer <b>port,</b> enabling location <b>of</b> large investments. In 1998 a terminal for import of liquid petrochemical gas (LPG) was opened. Rudoport (Oreport) and Europort will operate a modernised ore pier. Rudoport is going to import iron ores. In autumn of 2000 Europort will start its operation; it is a modern terminal <b>of</b> <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> grain and feed. It will serve for <b>transhipment</b> <b>of</b> grain and feed coming from Canada and the USA, and going to states of the former USSR, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The next investment will be a terminal of liquid chemical and oil-derived products. Further plans forecast construction of a terminal for natural gas (LNG). A novelty in the port is to be a huge container terminal with a yearly <b>transhipment</b> capacity <b>of</b> 500 thousand TEU. Container ships carrying up to 6 thousand TEU will be able to harbour here. It will cover a few dozen hectares in the Northern Port. In the hinterland of the terminal the Baltic Logistic Centre will come into being. A condition for development of the forecast investments is the fastest possible construction of the highway A-l and linking it with the port. In mid- 1999 construction of a bridge over the Dead Vistula was started. The bridge will be a fragment of a new ring road that will link the port with exit roads in the direction of Warsaw, Bydgoszcz and Łódź, and the ring road around the Gdansk agglomeration (then with the highway A-l). For 2002 construction of a tunnel (under the port canal) is planned. This enterprise will eliminate heavy car traffic that has to pass from the western part <b>of</b> the <b>port</b> through the crowded centre of Gdansk; it will improve transport within the port itself and will link the western part <b>of</b> the <b>port</b> with the national road network. Implementation of the presented above plans may substantially contribute to making at the same time the oldest and largest port on the Baltic one of the best and competitive ones on the Baltic and European market of sea trade in the coming 21 st century.
