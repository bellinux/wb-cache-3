5|$|The <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> LARP {{physically}} portray {{characters in}} a fictional setting, improvising their characters' speech and movements somewhat like actors in improvisational theatre. This is distinct from tabletop role-playing games, where character actions are described verbally. LARPs may be played in a public or private area and may last for hours or days. There is usually no audience. Players may dress as their character and carry appropriate equipment, and the environment is sometimes decorated to resemble the setting. LARPs can be one-off events or {{a series of events}} in the same setting, and events can vary in size from a handful of players to several thousand.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw {{sustained}} pro-democracy protests, centered at Pearl Roundabout in {{the capital}} of Manama, as part of the wider Arab Spring. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later known as Bloody Thursday), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured. Protests continued for a month reaching over 100,000 <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nation of about 500,000 citizens, until more than a thousand troops and police from the Gulf Cooperation Council arrived at the request of government and a three-month state of emergency was declared. Authorities then cracked down on the protests. However, smaller-scale protests and clashes continued to occur almost daily, mostly in areas outside Manama's business districts, with some rare marches {{in the center of the}} capital city. As of April 2012, more than 80 people had died since the start of the uprising and as of January 2013, near-daily clashes between protesters and police are ongoing.|$|E

5|$|Modern fantasy sports {{began in}} 1980 with the {{invention}} of Rotisserie League Baseball by New York writer Daniel Okrent and several friends. <b>Participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Rotisserie league draft notional teams {{from the list of}} active Major League Baseball players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players' latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as fantasy baseball, it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports. The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports–related websites. By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800million on the hobby. The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball professionals.|$|E
5|$|World War II, or the Second World War, was {{a global}} {{military}} conflict, the joining {{of what had}} initially been two separate conflicts. The first began in Asia in 1937 as the Second Sino-Japanese War; the other began in Europe in 1939 with the German invasion of Poland. This global conflict split {{the majority of the}} world's nations into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. It involved the mobilization of over 100 million military personnel, making it the most widespread war in history, and placed the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of total war, erasing the distinction between civil and military resources. This resulted in the complete activation of a nation's economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities {{for the purposes of the}} war effort. Over 60 million people, the majority of them civilians, were killed, making it the deadliest conflict in human history. The Allies were victorious, and, as a result, the United States and Soviet Union emerged as the world's two leading superpowers.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, other {{researchers}} write that CBT studies have high drop-out rates {{compared to other}} treatments. At times, the CBT drop-out rates can be {{more than five times}} higher than other treatments groups. For example, the researchers provided statistics of 28 <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> group receiving CBT therapy dropping out, compared to 5 <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> group receiving problem-solving therapy dropping out, or 11 <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> group receiving psychodynamic therapy dropping out. This high drop-out rate is also evident in the treatment of several disorders, particularly the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, which is commonly treated with CBT. Those treated with CBT have a high chance of dropping out of therapy before completion and reverting to their anorexia behaviors.|$|E
