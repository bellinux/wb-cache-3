50|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>processes</b> are {{the most}} {{permanent}} method around today in preserving timber life. <b>Pressure</b> <b>processes</b> are those in which the treatment is carried out in closed cylinders with applied pressure or vacuum. These processes {{have a number of}} advantages over the non-pressure methods. In most cases, a deeper and more uniform penetration and a higher absorption of preservative is achieved. Another advantage is that the treating conditions can be controlled so that retention and penetration can be varied. These <b>pressure</b> <b>processes</b> can be adapted to large-scale production. The high initial costs for equipment and the energy costs are the biggest disadvantages. These treatment methods are used to protect ties, poles and structural timbers and find use throughout the world today. The various <b>pressure</b> <b>processes</b> that are used today differ in details, but the general method is in all cases the same. The treatment is carried out in cylinders. The timbers are loaded onto special tram cars, so called buggies or bogies, and into the cylinder. These cylinders are then set under pressure often with the addition of higher temperature. As final treatment, a vacuum is frequently used to extract excess preservatives. These cycles can be repeated to achieve better penetration.|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{development}} of commercially applied high <b>pressure</b> <b>processes</b> it is necessary to evaluate the impact of high pressure on the inactivation of bacterial populations. From the results kinetic models should reliably predict inactivation under dynamic conditions. High <b>pressure</b> <b>processes</b> imply an initial phase of pressure build-up, accompanied by a temperature increase due to adiabatic heating. Since pressure application leads to the generation of heat, the question may arise whether this dynamic p-T profile will influence the spore inactivation. The come-up time (the time needed to reach the constant treatment conditions) is an important variable that needs to be considered in the design and optimization of high hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> <b>processes</b> due to its significant contribution to microbial inactivation. The pressure-temperature inactivation kinetics of Bacillus subtilis var. niger spores was first studied under isobaric-isothermal conditions in the pressure range 50 � 400 MPa at temperatures between 25 � 70 °C. Isobaric-isothermal inactivation of spores appears to follow a fairly linear trend and can be described by a first order model. The kinetic parameters (kref, Ea and DV¹) were calculated at different pressure and temperature levels. Assuming first order kinetics for non-isobaric/non-isothermal inactivation of Bacillus subtilis spores during the come-up time, the integral effect of the inactivation process under dynamic conditions was quantified. To do that, the above mentioned kinetic parameters were used to calculate the inactivation constants as a function of temperature and pressure. The total come-up time was divided in time steps of one second and the inactivation constants were calculated for each seconds time interval. The experimental pressure build-up was carried out in two different ways: (a) fast � pressure was developed with the highest possible rate and the come-up time was between 118 and 677 seconds depending on the pressure level of the treatment; (b) slow � pressure was built-up with a rate of 20 MPa/min and the come-up time was between 180 and 1337 seconds. The inactivation effects during these come-up times after fast and slow <b>pressure</b> build-up <b>processes</b> were measured and compared with the calculated effects. The comparison reveals an additional inactivation effect on spores due to dynamics of fast pressure build-up. This {{is the first time that}} such an effect has unambiguously been shown...|$|R
