40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} two decades, the {{prospect}} of a free cooling technologies possibilities led to several experimental and theoretical investigations by researchers. Nowadays, low temperature solar thermal systems coupled with sorption machines are the most commercialized solution available to face the cooling demand. Solar heating and cooling systems are currently available on the market and there are a hundred installations worldwide. The next challenge for this technology is to guarantee the performance of any solar cooling plant in the future. This paper aims at presenting the results of the optimisation of a solar cooling <b>plant.</b> This <b>work</b> is <b>part</b> of the French National Research Agency project (MEGAPICS n ANR- 09 -HABISOL- 007). Parameters, which {{have a significant effect on}} power production, are identified. Then simulations are carried out to evaluate the power increase according to an optimised configuration...|$|R

The plant was originally built in 1959 for the Prestcold fridge company and was later acquired by Ford who manufactured car axle and transmission components there. Ford later transferred the site to Visteon. The 30 acre site acquired by RT properties has been re-developed as a business park branded Swansea Gate Business Park. [...] The 265,000 sq ft. car parts factory was later closed and is now used a film studio.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} appropriate control strategies for a clarifier at an industrial wastewater treatment <b>plant.</b> This <b>work</b> is <b>part</b> of a larger project aimed at upgrading the control and operational practices of the full treatment plant, including the development of local and supervisory control systems. Five control strategies are proposed, implemented in a simulation environment and evaluated. The strategies used as measured variable, the sludge blanket height, which has been shown to correlate with the control objective, the effluent suspended solids concentration. The manipulated variable was the quantity of polymer added to the system. The strategies were evaluated in terms of their ability to maintain the sludge blanket height below 1. 5 m, their polymer requirements, their sensitivity to poor tuning and the required control action. The final choice of controller will be based on the ease and cost of implementation. KEY WORDS local control, secondary clarifier, simulation studie...|$|R

40|$|Mintek was {{contracted}} by Oriel Resources plc in 2004 {{to conduct}} a preliminary assessment study on smelting ferronickel from the large but relatively low grade Shevchenko nickel ore deposit in Kazakhstan. A detailed feasibility study (“DFS”) was awarded to Bateman BV following promising results from the pre-liminary assessment study (“PAS”) and small-scale pilot <b>plant</b> test <b>work.</b> As <b>part</b> of the DFS, a total of 450 metric tons of ore was collected from three different locations in the deposit and shipped to Mintek. After sam-pling, the bulk sample was prepared for smelting. This comprised crushing, screening and calcining with each step done separately for the three different lots. The chemical composition of the ore from the deposit is relatively high in silica and therefore falls out of the MgO to SiO 2 range that is normally processed by pyrometallurgical means to produce ferronickel. The main objective of the testwork was to demonstrate that a method could be found and successfully applied to smelt these siliceous ores and produce an acceptable nickel-containing alloy. A 2 -m ID DC arc furnace was installed with a twin-cathode (electrode) configuration to replicate the pro-posed commercial-scale furnace and also incorporated an advanced design of water-cooled copper panels in the lower furnace sidewalls to withstand the aggressive nature of the high SiO 2 -containing slags...|$|R
40|$|The copper smelter and {{refinery}} at Port Kembla, {{formerly known}} as the Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company (ER 2 ̆ 6 S), has attracted considerable controversy in recent times. The history from which the new works of the Southern Copper company emerges, however, is largely forgotten. This paper is about reclaiming part of that history. Its objective is simple – to move those people who are fundamental to that history out of the forgotten shadows to centre stage. The work of those who built and worked the furnaces and residents who absorbed much of the company’s environmental excesses in the form of lead fumes, sulphur dioxide and dusts, those who are {{the heart and soul of}} Port Kembla’s past – is largely ignored by their economic and political masters. Instead of work and toil we hear ‘jobs’; instead of work hazards and risks we hear ‘economic progress’; instead of injury and death we hear ‘the bottom line’; and in place of environmental or health justice, we hear ‘environmental best practice’ and assertions about environmental safety. This paper has four parts. The first part traces the history of the early days of the Port Kembla smelter. The second part examines working conditions within the plant and briefly tells the stories of some of the workers and residents. This part also looks at the responses of company, government, union and community to the <b>plant’s</b> <b>work.</b> The final <b>part</b> draws parallels between the past and the government’s recent decision to introduce special legislation and considers the implications of this case for the broader question of environmental justice...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: There {{are many}} ways to make the {{construction}} process more efficient and one of these ways is to streamline communication. The purpose of this bachelor thesis  is to analyze and develop communication between building and <b>plant</b> <b>works</b> on large construction companies. One of the most key factors for implementing a successful project {{is that there is a}} well-functioning communication. There is a terrific opportunity to save both time and money by streamlining communication.  Method: This work consists of a case study, the case studied consists of a company that has a construction- and <b>plant</b> <b>works</b> department where the communication between these departments has been investigated The case study that gave in-depth knowledge through studies consisting of; Interviews where experienced circumstances were described and document analysis showing how communication should be done according to NCC and a literature study where previously known communication problems and communication tools were studied. Findings: Communication between building and <b>plant</b> <b>works</b> is influenced by many factors, such as previous experiences, different references and ways of thinking. These factors can lead to problems in the form of irritation, disagreement and ambiguity in a workplace. To streamline communication and to largely eliminate these factors, it is recommended to have; short day meetings, training in communication, organization start and cooperation at an earlier stage, and that the person who’s sharing the information is directly linked to the recipient, which means that there is possibility of additional questions if uncertainty arises. Implications: Communication is often broken between the businesses buildings and <b>plant</b> <b>works,</b> often due to misinterpretation of information or when different perceptions arise as to who’s in charge and when to do what. To achieve better communication, education, application of short-day meetings and clearer information could be of significant use. A suggestion for further research is to test how the template for shortday meetings would work in production and what results it would get. Another suggestion is to investigate what it looks like at other major construction companies with communication between construction and <b>plant</b> <b>works</b> or test the template on other companies. Limitations: The report only studies how communication takes place during the production phase between buildings and <b>plant</b> <b>works</b> within NCC's local department in Jönköping. Since the demarcation of work was chosen for communication during the production phase, only employees who worked mainly during the production phase were interviewed.  Keywords: Communication, internal communication, building, <b>plant</b> <b>works,</b> production. ...|$|R
