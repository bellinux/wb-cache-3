From 1935–38 the dam was raised to increase its capacity for water supply and power generation. The dam, aqueduct and appurtenant hydroelectric systems are collectively known as the Hetch Hetchy Project.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the effect of {{agricultural}} and forestry land use on the structure of mayfly assemblages in low-order streams. Twenty-nine headwater streams were investigated in the state of S&# 227;o Paulo. We analyzed 15 streams in <b>pristine</b> <b>areas</b> (mixed tropical rainforest, semideciduous forest and dense tropical rainforest), and 14 streams covered with sugarcane, eucalyptus and pasture. Mayfly richness obtained by rarefaction curves was higher in <b>pristine</b> <b>areas</b> (21 genera), especially in mixed and semideciduous forest when compared to land use (9 genera), where values were particularly low in sugarcane plantation (3 genera). The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination showed clear difference in mayfly assemblages between land uses and <b>pristine</b> <b>areas,</b> supported by analysis of similarity (R= 0. 67, p= 0. 001). In partial redundancy analysis (pRDA), the environmental descriptors that best explained differences in assemblage structure were Riparian, Channel and Environmental Inventory (RCE) index score, percentage of fine sediment stream substrate, water pH and land elevation. Our results show that agricultural and forestry land use has a strong negative effect on the structure of mayfly assemblages. These results also support the use of mayflies as environmental indicators, as some genera were sensitive to changes in land use, while others responded to naturally occurring changes in the study area...|$|R

The government has established a 190,000 ha park in the region (Donegan & Huertas 2005; Huertas & Donegan 2006). The discovery was made by Thomas Donegan, of Fundación ProAves and Blanca Huertas, of the Natural History Museum and University College London, together with Elkin Briceno of CDMB. The research team had studied the isolated and densely vegetated region in various expeditions over a period of three years. Some regions had to be reached by all day hikes or helicopter drop.|$|E

50|$|This {{is one of}} the Wilderness Committee’s longest lasting {{campaigns to}} protect the largest area of ancient {{temperate}} rainforest left on BC's Vancouver Island. With 75% of Vancouver Island's old-growth rainforest already logged, forestry companies continue to push for more logging operations in this rare ancient coastal rainforest. In 2008, forestry company, MaMook Coulson proposed logging in one of Clayoquot Sound’s intact areas of ancient forest - the Hesquiat Point Creek Valley - sparking a strong response from the environmental community. Currently, no logging has taken place in the <b>pristine</b> <b>area</b> of Hesquiat Point Creek or any other intact area within Clayoquot Sound. But the conflict over potential logging in Hesquiat Point Creek has renewed the interest in finding a lasting solution for protecting Clayoquot Sound, while providing livelihood opportunities for those who live there. The designation of Clayoquot Sound as an UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 2000, while a huge step forward, does not provide legislated protection.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1900's, Ponte Vedra was {{primarily}} an area dominated by sand dunes, swamps, alligators, and palmetto trees. In 1912, {{it was discovered}} that these dunes were rich in desirable minerals, containing rutile, ilmenite, and zirconium. These minerals were vital in the production of steel, which was in high demand during this era. After this discovery, attention was drawn to this <b>pristine</b> <b>area</b> of wilderness, in turn, resulting in the transformation to a mining town with a workers' quarter, a post office, and a supermarket. The National Lead Company took over the area for the purpose of mining ore and spurred development of the mineral-rich land, which supported the war effort. After World War I ended, demand for the minerals decreased and the company decided to transform the beachfront property into a resort community, covering the property with seaside houses, small and pastel in color. After a few years, the Ponte Vedra Inn and Club debuted in 1928, bringing an influx of socialites from nearby San Jose, San Marco, Ortega, and Riverside.|$|E
