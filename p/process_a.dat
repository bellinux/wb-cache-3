The duo was independently scouted by the beautiful NSS agent, Choi Seung-hee (Kim Tae-hee). Unaware they have been scouted, the two were secretly captured and subjected through a simulated torture test, and both passed their test to be worthy NSS agents.

5|$|Oryzomys {{species have}} a large skull with a short rostrum and high braincase. The interorbital region, located between the eyes, is narrowest {{to the front and}} is flanked by {{well-developed}} beads at its margins. The zygomatic plate is broad and has a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. The zygomatic arch is robust and contains a small but distinct jugal bone. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is narrow and short; its narrowness is a synapomorphy for O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat according to Weksler's analysis. The incisive foramina are long, with their back margin {{at the front of the}} first molars or further back. The palate is also long, extending beyond the back margin of the maxillary bone, and is perforated near the third molars by well-developed posterolateral palatal pits. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some other oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The auditory bullae are large. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. In the mandible (lower jaw), the coronoid <b>process,</b> <b>a</b> process at the back, is well developed and the capsular <b>process,</b> <b>a</b> raising of the mandibular bone housing the root of the lower incisor, is conspicuous.|$|E

5|$|Teleosts {{have adopted}} a range of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most use external fertilisation: the female lays a batch of eggs, the male fertilises them and the larvae develop without any further parental involvement. A fair proportion of teleosts are sequential hermaphrodites, starting life as females and transitioning to males at some stage, with a few species reversing this <b>process.</b> <b>A</b> small percentage of teleosts are viviparous and some provide parental care with typically the male fish guarding a nest and fanning the eggs to keep them well-oxygenated.|$|E
