25|$|Green Day: Rock Band allows {{players to}} perform {{simulated}} rock music by providing {{up to four}} players {{with the ability to}} play three different controllers modeled after music instruments: a guitar controller for lead guitar and bass guitar gameplay, a drum controller and a microphone for vocals. Players simulate the performance of rock music by using their controllers to play scrolling on-screen notes. For lead and bass guitar, this is accomplished by holding down colored buttons mimicking guitar frets and pushing the controller's strum bar. For drums, this requires striking the matching colored drumhead, or stepping on the pedal to simulate playing bass drum notes. When singing vocals, the player must sing in relative pitch to the original vocals. A <b>pitch</b> <b>indicator</b> displays the singer's accuracy relative to the original pitch. The game supports harmonies as introduced in , allowing multiple singers to perform the vocal portion. Harmonies will be added to the six songs already available as downloadable content for the game when played in Green Day: Rock Band.|$|E

2500|$|Rock Band titles' {{gameplay}} and on-screen interface use {{a combination}} of elements from Guitar Hero and Karaoke Revolution. Rock Band has up to three tracks of vertically scrolling colored music notes, one section each for lead guitar, drums, and bass. The colored notes on-screen correspond to buttons on the guitar and drum peripherals. For lead and bass guitar, players play their notes by holding down colored fret buttons on the guitar peripheral and pushing the controller's strum bar; for drums, players must strike the matching colored drumhead, or step on the pedal to simulate playing bass drum notes. Along the top of the screen is the vocals display, which scrolls horizontally, similar to Karaoke Revolution. The lyrics display beneath green bars, which represent the pitch of the individual vocal elements. When singing vocals, the player must sing in relative pitch to the original vocals. A <b>pitch</b> <b>indicator</b> displays the singer's accuracy relative to the original pitch by moving up or down to indicate high or low pitches, respectively. [...] introduces three-part harmonies using three separate microphones, a feature later carried over into [...] and Rock Band 3. If any part is not being played, its interface does not appear on-screen. The remainder of the screen is used to display the band's virtual characters as they perform in concert.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a reliability {{analysis of a}} technical system. It {{is divided into three}} main sections. The first section introduces some of the most significant problems of reliability. It deals with a definition and an expresion of reliability, a reliability diagram selection and {{a detailed description of the}} reliability analysis. This part also includes an overview of reliability analysis types. Some of the most widely used reliability analyses are briefly described; further advantages and disadvantages of using each method are listed. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis - FMEA is then described in a greater detail. The second section contains an analysis of aviation conditions as well as a design of a reliability analysis that concerns a selected digital system; the system under analysis is a <b>pitch</b> trim <b>indicator.</b> The main design issue lies in a choice of a most suitable method. This choice stems from the overview of reliability analyses presented in the first section of the thesis. In the last section, a FMEA reliability analysis of the <b>pitch</b> trim <b>indicator</b> is conducted. This part includes a discussion of the results as well as a design action that is to lead to an increase in reliability of the analyzed system...|$|R

50|$|The initial {{discovery}} {{of the problem with}} the vessel’s propulsion system occurred when the Barberi’s chief engineer went up to the pilothouse after the collision. The engineer found that even though the pitch levers were in the neutral position, the propeller <b>pitch</b> <b>indicator</b> for the New York-end unit read out 50% thrust. This indication was confirmed by the stream of water that was being pushed away from the stern of the vessel. The chief engineer then unsuccessfully attempted to bring the propulsion unit to zero pitch using the pilothouse controls. Control of the propulsion units was transferred to the engine room, where the crew used the units’ local controls to bring the pitch to zero. When the crew later attempted to back the Barberi out of the terminal using these local controls, both propulsion units functioned normally.|$|E

40|$|A {{literature}} review {{was conducted to}} identify past efforts in providing control guidance for aircraft upset recovery including stall recovery. Because guidance is integrally linked to the intended function of aircraft attitude awareness and upset recognition, it is difficult, if not impossible, to consider these issues separately. This {{literature review}} covered the aspects of instrumentation and display symbologies for attitude awareness, aircraft upset recognition, upset and stall alerting, and control guidance. Many different forms of symbology have been investigated including, but not limited to, pitch scale depictions, attitude indicator icons, horizon symbology, attitude recovery arrows, and <b>pitch</b> trim <b>indicators.</b> Past research on different visual and alerting strategies that provide advisories, cautions, and warnings to pilots before entering an unusual attitude (UA) are also discussed. Finally, potential control guidance for recovery from upset or unusual attitudes, including approach-to-stall and stall conditions, are reviewed. Recommendations for future research are made...|$|R
40|$|Two major {{objectives}} were {{set for the}} present study: to provide reference data for the description of Czech and English F 0 contours, and to investigate {{the limits of the}} ‘interference hypothesis’ on Czech English data. Altogether, the production of 40 speakers in 2392 breath-group F 0 contours was analyzed. The speech of 32 professional speakers of English and Czech provides reference values for various acoustic correlates of pitch level, pitch span and downtrend gradient. These values were subsequently used as a benchmark for a confirmation of the interference hypothesis through comparison with a further sample of 8 non-professional speakers of English and Czech-accented English. The native English speakers of both genders produced significantly higher <b>pitch</b> level <b>indicators,</b> wider <b>pitch</b> span and a steeper downtrend gradient than the reference native speakers of Czech. Although the pitch level of the Czech-accented material lies in between the two reference groups, the pitch span of this group is the narrowest, which indicates that factors of foreign-accentedness other than simply interference are in effect...|$|R
50|$|A {{clinometer}} or inclinometer is {{an instrument}} for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or depression of an object with respect to gravity. It {{is also known as}} a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and <b>pitch</b> & roll <b>indicator.</b> Clinometers measure both inclines (positive slopes, as seen by an observer looking upwards) and declines (negative slopes, as seen by an observer looking downward) using three different units of measure: degrees, percent, and topo (see Grade (slope)#Nomenclature for details). Astrolabes are inclinometers that were used for navigation and locating astronomical objects from ancient times to the Renaissance.|$|R

40|$|The {{information}} architecture of general aviation cockpits is shifting {{from one of}} independent mechanical instruments to one of digital sensors, common databuses, and liquid crystal displays. This integrated architecture presents an opportunity to improve general aviation safety through enhancements to the flight display utilizing the data, computing power, and display capabilities available on a modem integrated cockpit. A study of general aviation accident causes identified takeoff and climbout, stall, and spatial disorientation as potential root causes that could be addressed with enhancements to the Primary Flight Display of an integrated general aviation cockpit. To address these accident causes, four prototype enhancements were designed, implemented on a PFD, and flight tested in a single-engine general aviation aircraft. A Takeoff Performance Monitor prototype demonstrated the usefulness of automating the published takeoff distance calculation required of, but seldom performed by, pilots and also showed that performance deficiencies {{as small as a}} 10 % reduction in power can be detected within the first few seconds immediately after throttle-up. The prototype was also able to predict takeoff distance in real-time within 200 feet by 55 knots using a simple acceleration model. A Dynamic Stall and V-Speeds prototype calculated stall speeds, best angle of climb speed, best rate of climb speed, and best glide speed given the current flight conditions and marked them on the airspeed indicator. Subject pilots reported the speeds aided in maintaining awareness of stall margin and optimal performance conditions. (cont.) An Angle of Attack Estimator that used a speed-based method and an angle-based method to compute the angle of attack using only the data available on the PFD without additional sensors was prototyped along with two means of display; a traditional angle of attack gauge and a <b>Pitch</b> Limit <b>Indicator.</b> Both estimator methods were compared to an angle of attack vane during a series of maneuvers. It was shown that a speed-based angle of attack estimator along with the <b>pitch</b> limit <b>indicator</b> is a useful stall avoidance aid. Finally, an Unusual Attitude Alerting prototype provided specific verbal cues over the intercom when pitch or roll limits were exceeded to aid a pilot in recovery from unusual attitudes. Subject pilots preferred alerts that commanded the recovery maneuver over alerts that informed the pilot of the attitude but left the recovery procedure to the pilot, and preferred both to alerts that simply told the pilot to recover without specific information about the attitude. by Daniel R.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an empirical}} and theoretical study of sentence-level prosody in Conamara (Connemara) Irish. It addresses {{the architecture of}} the syntax-phonology interface and the relation between syntactic constituent structure and prosodic structure formation. It argues for a fully interactional view of the interface, in which the phonological form may be influenced by a number of competing factors, including constraints governing syntax-prosody correspondence, linearization, and prosodic well-formedness. ^ The specific proposal is set within the framework of Match Theory (Selkirk 2009 b, 2011), an indirect-reference theory of the syntax-prosody interface in which correspondence between syntactic and prosodic constituents is governed by a family of violable MATCH constraints. These constraints call for a one-to-one correspondence between syntactic and prosodic structure, to the extent that prosodic structure may be recursive under pressure from the recursive nature of syntactic phrases. However, this direct correspondence can be overruled by other interacting constraints, including prosodic markedness constraints and, as proposed here, other correspondence relations, as on the linearization of hierarchical syntactic structures. ^ This dissertation argues that the distribution of pitch accents in Conamara Irish provides direct evidence for Match Theory. It is proposed that two phrasal pitch accents, L-H and H-L, demarcate the edges of phonological phrases, where L-H accents specifically target only those phrases which are recursive. Using the distribution of these <b>pitch</b> accents as <b>indicators</b> for the presence of prosodic boundaries, the dissertation investigates a variety of syntactic structures in both the clausal and nominal domain. It is argued that there is a close correspondence between syntactic and prosodic structure in default cases, but that this direct correspondence may be subverted in favour of a structure which better satisfies higher-ranked prosodic markedness constraints. ^ Finally, this dissertation addresses pronoun postposing, a process pervasive in Irish dialects in word order appears to be sensitive to prosodic structure. This dissertation proposes to account for this phenomenon using the theoretical framework developed in the dissertation, in which the main patterns are accounted for through the interaction of MATCH constraints, prosodic markedness constraints, and a proposed violable constraint on the linearization of syntactic structure. ...|$|R
40|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has {{recently}} {{emphasized the importance}} of analyzing flight data {{as one of the most}} effective methods to improve eciency and safety of helicopter operations. By analyzing flight data with Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) programs, the safety and performance of helicopter operations can be evaluated and improved. In spite of the NTSB 2 ̆ 7 s effort, the safety of helicopter operations has not improved at the same rate as the safety of worldwide airlines, and the accident rate of helicopters continues to be much higher than that of fixed-wing aircraft. One of the main reasons is that the participation rates of the rotorcraft industry in the FDM programs are low due to the high costs of the Flight Data Recorder (FDR), the need of a special readout device to decode the FDR, anxiety of punitive action, etc. Since a video camera is easily installed, accessible, and inexpensively maintained, cockpit video data could complement the FDR in the presence of the FDR or possibly replace the role of the FDR in the absence of the FDR. Cockpit video data is composed of image and audio data: image data contains outside views through cockpit windows and activities on the flight instrument panels, whereas audio data contains sounds of the alarms within the cockpit. ^ The goal of this research is to develop, test, and demonstrate a cockpit video data analysis algorithm based on data mining and signal processing techniques that can help better understand situations in the cockpit and the state of a helicopter by efficiently and accurately inferring the useful flight information from cockpit video data. Image processing algorithms based on data mining techniques are proposed to estimate a helicopter 2 ̆ 7 s attitude such as the bank and <b>pitch</b> angles, identify <b>indicators</b> from a flight instrument panel, and read the gauges and the numbers in the analogue gauge indicators and digital displays from cockpit image data. In addition, an audio processing algorithm based on signal processing and abrupt change detection techniques is proposed to identify types of warning alarms and to detect the occurrence times of individual alarms from cockpit audio data. Those proposed algorithms are then successfully applied to simulated and real helicopter cockpit video data to demonstrate and validate their performance. ...|$|R
