25|$|As {{demand for}} silver {{increased}} and large-scale manufacturing techniques emerged, silver products {{became much more}} standardized. For special-order objects that would likely only be made once, silversmiths generally used lost-wax casting, in which a sculpted object was carved out of wax, an investment casting was made, and the wax was melted away. The molds produced in this manner could only be used once, which made them inconvenient for standard objects like handles and buckles. <b>Permanent</b> <b>mold</b> casting, an industrial casting technique focused on high-volume production, allowed smiths to reuse molds to make exact replicas {{of the most commonly}} used items they sold. In creating these molds and developing standardized manufacturing processes, silversmiths could begin delegating some work to apprentices and journeymen. For instance, after 1780, Paul Revere's sons took on more significant roles in his shop, and his silver pieces often included wooden handles made by carpenters more experienced with woodwork. For even some of the most successful artisans like Revere, artisan was not a profitable enterprise compared to mass-production using iron or bronze casting. Creating products that could be replicated for multiple customers, adopting new business practices and labor policies, and new equipment made manufacturing more ultimately efficient. These changes, in tandem with new techniques and requirements defined by changing social standards, led to the introduction of new manufacturing techniques in Colonial America that preceded and anticipated the industrial revolution.|$|E

Four commercial mold coatings have been evaluated for their insulating ability, wear resistance and roughness. The results indicate that composition and structure of the mold materials have considerable effect on their thermal fatigue cracking behavior.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of LPPM casting are from aluminum and magnesium, but some are copper alloys. Advantages include very little turbulence when filling the mold because of the constant pressure, which minimizes gas porosity and dross formation.

This paper focuses its research on some of the factors, such as the dimensions of the vertical riser and slot thickness, as well as roughness of the coating layer. The results indicate that molten metal can smoothly fi ll into casting cavity with a proper slot gating system. A bigger vertical riser, proper slot thickness and rougher coating can provide not only a better mold fi lling pattern, but also hot melt into the top of the cavity. A proper temperature gradient is obtainable, higher at the bottom and lower at the top of the casting cavity, which is in favor of feeding during casting solidifi cation...|$|R
50|$|Slush casting is {{a variant}} of <b>permanent</b> <b>molding</b> casting to create a hollow casting or hollow cast. In the process the {{material}} is poured into the mold and allowed to cool until a shell of material forms in the mold. The remaining liquid is then poured out to leave a hollow shell. The resulting casting has good surface detail but the wall thickness can vary. The process is usually used to cast ornamental products, such as candlesticks, lamp bases, and statuary, from low-melting-point materials. A similar technique is used to make hollow chocolate figures for Easter and Christmas.|$|R
40|$|Quite often complex shapes are not {{manufacturable}} as {{a single}} component. Due to manufacturing constraints, the desired complex object needs to be partitioned {{into a number of}} smaller and simpler manufacturable components. After manufacturing individual components, the complex object is realized by assembling various components together. Therefore, spatial-partitioning can be used to perform shape synthesis of manufacturable objects in many applications. This paper describes a systematic approach to solving the general manufacturability-driven spatial partitioning problem that arises in various types of manufacturing processes due to tool accessibility problems.

40|$|The {{design of}} a <b>permanent</b> Step <b>mold</b> for the {{evaluation}} of the mechanical properties of light alloys has been reviewed. An optimized Step die with a different runner and gating systems is proposed to minimize the amount of casting defects. Numerical simulations have been performed to study the filling and solidification behavior of an AM 60 B alloy to predict the turbulence of the melt and the microshrinkage formation. The results reveal how a correct design of the trap in the runners prevents the backwave of molten metal, which could eventually reverse out and enter the die cavity. The tapered runner in the optimized die configuration gently leads the molten metal to the ingate, avoiding turbulence and producing a balanced die cavity filling. The connection between the runner system and the die cavity by means of a fan ingate produces a laminar filling in contrast with a finger-type ingate. Solidification defects such as shrinkage induced microporosity, numerically predicted through a dimensionless version of the Niyama criterion, are considerably reduced in the optimized <b>permanent</b> Step <b>mold...</b>|$|R

40|$|Issue: It is {{very simple}} to fuse {{recycled}} container glass to make tiles and relief plaques. However, information on raw material characteristics, temperature profiles, and operational issues has not been widely disseminated. Best Practice: At temperatures considerably below melting, particles of metal, ceramics, or glass begin to bond through a process called sintering. Sintering of soda-lime glass begins at about 1250 ° F. Sintering {{can be used to}} create solid glass objects by heating glass particles to above the sintering point and holding at that temperature until a dense body forms. The basic steps are described below: 1) Obtain a mold that will withstand temperatures of at least 1600 °F. For instructions on casting <b>permanent</b> <b>molds,</b> see <b>Permanent</b> <b>Molds</b> for Fusing Glass Best Practice. Coat the mold with a release. Commercial “shelf paints ” are available. A mixture of 40 % kaolin and 60 % alumina hydrate also works well. 2) Fill the mold with glass pieces. Glass of any size can be used. However, the most consistent success has been obtained with glass that has been crushed to a uniform shape and screened to a size 16 mesh and finer. There is a trade-off here between glass grain size and cleanliness. It is easier to obtain a glassy, translucent product with larger grain sizes, but smaller grain sizes minimize contamination. 3) Fire the kiln to fusing temperatures. For green or amber container glass, the following schedule is a place to start: 500 °F/hour to 1100 °F (organic contamination should be gone by this point) 500 °F/hour to 1600 °F (or go as fast as the kiln will rise) soak 5 minutes at 1600 °F (this is the critical time & temp – experiment) Natural cooling to 1020 °F Soak 15 minutes at 1020 °F (may need longer soak for thick or uneven pieces) 70 °F/hour to 950 °F Cool 300 °F/hour to 250 °F Open kiln to cool to ambient Each kiln acts differently. The maximum temperature that works best in a particular kiln may be anywhere from 1500 to 1600 °F. Fusing can also be done in cone kilns. Fire at maximum and try cone 010, 011, 012, and 013. If the fused tiles have bubbles or bloat, it may mean that organics need more time to burn out. Try soaking at 1100 °F for 10 to 20 minutes...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} a feature-based approach to automated design of multi-piece sacrificial molds. We use multi-piece sacrificial molds to create complex 3 D polymer/ceramic parts. Multi-piece molds refer to molds that contain {{more than two}} mold components or subassemblies. Our methodology has the following three benefits over the state-of-the-art. First, by using multi-piece molds we can create complex 3 D objects that are impossible to create using traditional two piece molds. Second, we make use of sacrificial molds. Therefore, using multi-piece sacrificial molds, we can create parts that pose disassembly problems for <b>permanent</b> <b>molds.</b> Third, mold design steps are significantly automated in our methodology. Therefore, we can create the functional part from the CAD model of the part {{in a matter of}} hours and so our approach can be used in small batch manufacturing environments. The basic idea behind our mold design algorithm is as follows. We first form the desired gross mold shape based on the feature-based description of the part geometry. If the desired gross mold shape is not manufacturable as a single piece, we decompose the gross mold shape into simpler shapes to make sure that each component is manufacturable using CNC machining. During the decomposition step, we account for tool accessibility to make sure that (1) each component is manufacturable, and (2) components can be assembled together to form the gross mold shape. Finally, we add assembly features to mold component shapes to facilitate easy assembly of mold components and eliminate unnecessary degree of freedoms from the final mold assembly...|$|R
