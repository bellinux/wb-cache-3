40|$|A {{large number}} of studies have {{demonstrated}} that <b>proximity</b> <b>effects</b> from knowledge spillovers, network externalities and other forms of knowledge transfers among like firms are geographically bounded. However, only a few studies have measured the strength and geographic scope of such externalities and even fewer have done so for firms in very close proximity.

2500|$|Another {{situation}} for which this formula is not exact is with alternating current (AC), because the skin effect inhibits current flow {{near the center}} of the conductor. For this reason, the geometrical cross-section is different from the effective cross-section in which current actually flows, so resistance is higher than expected. Similarly, if two conductors near each other carry AC current, their resistances increase due to the <b>proximity</b> <b>effect.</b> At commercial power frequency, these [...] effects are significant for large conductors carrying large currents, such as busbars in an electrical substation, or large power cables carrying more than a few hundred amperes.|$|E

This produces a more-intimate, less-reverberant sound than is heard when a singer is [...] or more from the microphone. When implemented using a pressure-gradient (uni- or bi-directional) microphone, it emphasizes low-frequency sounds in the voice due to the microphone's <b>proximity</b> <b>effect</b> and gives a more relaxed feel because the performer is not working as hard. The result is a singing style which diverged strongly from the unamplified theater-style singing that is heard in the musical comedies of the 1930s-40s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{unidirectional}} microphone is a cardioid microphone, {{so named because}} the sensitivity pattern is [...] "heart-shaped", i.e. a cardioid. The cardioid family of microphones are commonly used as vocal or speech microphones, since they are good at rejecting sounds from other directions. In three dimensions, the cardioid is shaped like an apple centred around the microphone which is the [...] "stem" [...] of the apple. The cardioid response reduces pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid feedback from the monitors. Since these directional transducer microphones achieve their patterns by sensing pressure gradient, putting them {{very close to the}} sound source (at distances of a few centimeters) results in a bass boost due to the increased gradient. This is known as the <b>proximity</b> <b>effect.</b> The SM58 has been the most commonly used microphone for live vocals for more than 50 years demonstrating the importance and popularity of cardioid mics.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{relates to}} the study of power system {{harmonics}} in the built environment and in particular, cable heating caused by <b>proximity</b> <b>effects</b> due to harmonic distortion. Although in recent years, some movement has taken place in the standards to offer harmonic de-rating factors, heating in cables due to skin and <b>proximity</b> <b>effects</b> has not been quantified effectively. Thus, in this paper we present a model for proximity heating and consider numerical simulations to assess this effect in both two- and three-dimensions for different harmonics. Example results are presented to illustrate the model developed which is based on a general solution for the Magnetic Vector Potential in the Fresnel zone. The model provides the basis for using voxel modelling systems to investigate <b>proximity</b> <b>effects</b> for a range of configurations and complex topologies with applications to the design of power cables, cable trays and ducts, inter-connections, busbar junctions and transformers, for example.

5000|$|<b>Proximity</b> <b>effect</b> is {{a change}} in the {{frequency}} response of a directional pattern microphone that results in an emphasis on lower frequencies.

40|$|Abstract. After {{ionizing}} radiation has induced double-strand DNA breaks (dsb), misrejoining produces chromosome aberrations. Aberration yields are in ¯ uenced by p̀roximity’ effects, i. e. by {{the dependence of}} misrejoining probabilities on initial dsb separations. We survey <b>proximity</b> <b>effects,</b> empha-sizing implication s for chromosome aberration-formation mechanisms, for chromatin geometry, and for dose ± response relations. Evidence for <b>proximity</b> <b>effects</b> comes from observed biases for centric rings and against three-way inter-changes, relative to dicentrics or translocations. Other evi-dence comes from the way aberration yields depend on radiation dose and quality, tightly bunched ionizations being relatively effective. We conclude: (1) that misrejoining probabilities decrease as the distance between dsb {{at the time of}} their formation increases, and almost all misrejoining occurs among dsb initially separated by < 1 / 3 of a cell nucleus diameter; (2) that chromosomes occupy (irregular) terri-tories during the G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle, having dimensions also roughly 1 / 3 of a cell nucleus diameter; (3) that <b>proximity</b> <b>effects</b> have the potential to probe how much different chromosomes intertwine or move relative to each other; and (4) that incorporation of <b>proximity</b> <b>effects</b> into the classic random breakage-and-reunion model allows quan-titative interrelation of yields for many different aberration types and of data obtained with various FISH painting methods or whole-genome scoring. 1...|$|R
