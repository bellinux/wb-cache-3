5|$|Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan {{languages}} (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), {{also part}} of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few children learn these languages, but in recent years the local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region. The Ainu language, which has no proven relationship to Japanese or any other language, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido. <b>Public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>schools</b> generally require students to take Japanese language classes as well as English language courses.|$|E
5|$|Music is an {{important}} part of education in the United States, and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. Music education is generally mandatory in public elementary schools, and is an elective in later years. High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation in the form of a large school band. Music may also be a part of theatrical productions put on by a school's drama department. Many <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>schools</b> have sponsored music clubs and groups, most commonly including the marching band that performs at high school sports games, a trend that began with the wide popularity of Sousa's bands in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E
5|$|Blue's Clues {{was set in}} the home—the {{environment}} that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers—and looked like no other children's television show. Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed {{and approved by the}} show's creators and research team, were tested at <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>schools,</b> day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story {{in the form of a}} storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.|$|E

5|$|On November 4, 2008, a {{bond issue}} {{for a new}} $95 million high school was passed. Groundbreaking for the new high school took place on September 23, 2009, and {{construction}} was completed on April 1, 2012 at $7 million under budget. As a result, the school board approved construction of a $975,000 ticket/concession/restroom and storage building. This also allowed the asphalt parking to be changed to concrete and for adding artificial turf to the football field, which saves on future maintenance costs. Installation of the football field's turf was completed in September 2011. In early 2012, the Board of Education approved a 1-1 initiative, providing every student with an iPad. In 2012, GCHS was selected as one of 314 Blue Ribbon Schools nationwide. The Blue Ribbon Award recognizes <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>schools</b> which perform at high levels or have made significant academic improvements. In addition, principal James Mireles was honored with the Terrel H. Bell Award for Outstanding Leadership.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{prompted}} the closures of <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>schools,</b> businesses, offices, and factories throughout the Northeast. In some areasmdash&such {{as the city}} of Boston and parts of New Jerseymdash&classes were canceled for the entire week following the snowstorm. In New York City, student attendance remained extremely low {{in the days after}} schools reopened. The New York Public Library was forced to close its main location and all of its 80 branches. Non-essential government offices in Washington, D.C. were also closed because of the storm. Air and ground transportation came to a halt, with multiple major airports closed and rail service suspended. At La Guardia and Idlewild (now John F. Kennedy International) airports alone, over 100 flights were canceled. Railroads reported {{tens of millions of dollars}} in lost revenue and storm-related expenses.|$|E
5|$|Governor Lawton Chiles {{declared}} a state of emergency and activated about one-third of the Florida National Guard. Many residents evacuated, most voluntarily, from Broward, Charlotte, Collier, Lee, Martin, Dade, Monroe, Palm Beach, and Sarasota counties. A total of 142shelters opened in these counties and collectively housed at least 84,340people. In Dade County alone, 515,670people were ordered to evacuate. As Andrew was approaching, an estimated 20,00030,000tourists were in the Florida Keys (Monroe County). Overall, almost 1.2million people evacuated, which contributed to the low number of fatalities, despite the intensity of the storm. Many evacuees also checked into hotels, with rooms completely booked as far north as Ocala. Ultimately, the sheer number of evacuees led to likely the largest traffic jam in the history of Florida, mostly along Interstate 95. United States Coast Guard vessels on or near the Florida coastline were either secured onshore or sent to ride out the storm at sea. Government offices and <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>schools</b> were closed from Monroe County northward to St. Lucie County. Many colleges and universities in southeast Florida also closed, including Barry University, Broward Community College, Florida Atlantic University, Florida International University, Nova Southeastern University, and the University of Miami. Major airports such as the Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood, Key West, Miami, and Palm Beach international airports closed.|$|E
