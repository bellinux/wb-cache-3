It has been observed that the date-tree can live in dry and barren spots; but it loves the beds of streams and places where moisture is procurable. The palms scattered over the other parts of the plain, and depending solely upon rain water, produce less fruit, and that too of an inferior quality.|$|E

This is called the Masjid Arafat, and is erected upon a mound also named Tall Arafat, because on one occasion the Prophet, being unable to visit the Holy Mountain at the pilgrimage season, stood there, saw through the intervening space, and in spirit performed the ceremony. Here also we looked into a window instead of opening the door with a silver key, and the mesquin appearance of all within prevented my regretting the necessity of economy. In India or in Sind every village would have a better Mosque. Our last visit was to a fourth chapel, the Masjid Ali, so termed because the Apostle's son-in-law had a house upon this spot.[FN#25] After praying there-and terribly hot the little hole was!-we repaired to the last place of visitation at Kuba-a large deep well called the Bir al-Aris, in a garden to the West of the Mosque of Piety, with a little oratory adjoining it. A <b>Persian</b> <b>wheel</b> was going drowsily round, and the cool water fell into a tiny pool, whence it whirled and bubbled away in childish mimicry of a river. The music sounded sweet in my ears; I stubbornly refused to do any more praying-though Shaykh Hamid, for form's sake, reiterated with parental emphasis, [...] "how very wrong it was,"-and I sat down, as the Prophet himself did not disdain to do, with the resolution of enjoying on the brink of the well a few moments of unwonted [...] "Kayf." [...] The heat was overpowering, though it was only nine o'clock, the sound of the stream was soothing, that water-wheel was creaking a lullaby, and the limes and pomegranates, gently rustling, shed voluptuous fragrance through the morning air. I fell asleep, and-wondrous the contrast!-dreamed that I was once more standing ...|$|E

50|$|In a {{publication}} by Thomas Ewbank regarding Hydraulics (Hydraulics. 16th ed., 1876. Fig. 165.), Ewbank attributes {{a drawing of}} a section of a spiral pump to H. A. Wirtz.

It is likely that he knew of the design of other devices such as the Archimedes' screw and the <b>Persian</b> <b>wheel.</b> It has been suggested that owing to his profession, he would have had the know how to create a tubular spiral from metal.

5000|$|The word charkha {{which has}} links with <b>Persian</b> چرخ: charKh, <b>wheel,</b> {{is related to}} the word [...] "circle" [...] (rather like [...] "church" [...] is to [...] "kirk").

The charkha, a small, portable, hand-cranked wheel, is ideal for spinning cotton and other fine, short-staple fibres, though {{it can be used to}} spin other fibers as well. The size varies, from that of a hardbound novel to the size of a briefcase, to a floor charkha. Mahatma Gandhi brought the charkha into wider use with his teachings. He hoped the charkha would assist the people of India achieve self-sufficiency and independence, and therefore used the charkha as a symbol of the Indian independence movement and included it on earlier versions of the Flag of India.|$|R

50|$|A sakia, {{alternative}} spelling sakieh or saqiya (from ساقية, sāqīya), {{also called}} <b>Persian</b> <b>wheel,</b> tablia, and in Latin tympanum is a mechanical water lifting device which uses buckets, jars, or scoops fastened either {{directly to a}} vertical wheel, or to an endless belt activated by such a wheel. The vertical wheel is itself attached by a drive shaft to a horizontal wheel, which is traditionally {{set in motion by}} animal power (oxen, donkeys, etc.) Because it is not using the power of flowing water, the sakia is different from a noria and any other type of water-wheel. It is still used in India, Egypt {{and other parts of the}} Middle East, and in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands. It may have been invented in Hellenistic Egypt, Persia or India. The sakia was mainly used for irrigation, but not exclusively, as the example of Qusayr Amra shows, where it was used at least in part to provide water for a royal bathhouse.|$|E
5000|$|Both the Qur'an and sharia (Islamic law) {{provided}} {{the basis for}} enforcing Islamic administration over the independent Hindu rulers, but the sultanate made only fitful progress in the beginning, when many campaigns were undertaken for plunder and temporary reduction of fortresses. The effective rule of a sultan depended largely on his ability to control the strategic places that dominated the military highways and trade routes, extract the annual land tax, and maintain personal authority over military and provincial governors. Sultan 'Ala ud-Din made an attempt to reassess, systematize, and unify land revenues and urban taxes and to institute a highly centralized system of administration over his realm, but his efforts were abortive. Although agriculture in North India improved as a result of new canal construction and irrigation methods, including what {{came to be known as}} the <b>Persian</b> <b>wheel,</b> prolonged political instability and parasitic methods of tax collection brutalized the peasantry. Yet trade and a market economy, encouraged by the free-spending habits of the aristocracy, acquired new impetus both inand overseas. Experts in metalwork, stonework, and textile manufacture responded to the new patronage with enthusiasm. In this period Persian language and many Persian cultural aspects became dominant in the centers of power in Meric'a, as the rulers of the Delhi sultanate (who, though being Turkish or Afghan, had been thoroughly Persianized since the era of the Ghaznavids) [...] patronized aspects of the foreign culture and language from their seat of power in India.|$|E
40|$|Much of the non-traditional, irrigated, {{agricultural}} land {{in developing nations}} utilizes pumping technologies which have been adapted from the developed nations. These technologies are adaptable to the medium and large scale farms (individual farms in excess of 2 hectares) but are not adaptable to smaller farms. It has been these larger third world farmers who {{have been able to}} take the fullest advantage of the benefits of new seed varieties in wheat and rice combined with fertilizer and water, the ingredients of the "green revolution. " This short paper summarizes the experience to date of developing water pumping systems for small farms in selected deltaic areas of the 'third world,' those areas in which irrigation water is available at depths between 1. 5 and 4. 5 meters (m). These areas include the Nile, Euphrates, Indus, Ganges, Irrawaddy, and Mekong River Basins which combined encompass 50 million hectares of the earth's surface (less than one percent of the earth's land area) and contain roughly 250 million people (nearly 7 percent of the world's population). The analyses evaluate water supplied by traditional means [...] human and animal [...] by conventional systems [...] diesel, gasoline and electric [...] and by renewable resource systems, in particular photovoltaic powered systems. A review of previous studies indicate that the value of water for irrigation is in the range of two to three cents (U. S.) per cubic meter (m 3). The methods of lifting water, available to farmers on land areas of one hectare or less, provide water at costs in excess of this two to three cents (U. S.) per m 3. Investigations of the Shadoof systems of North Africa and Asia show costs of water as high as seven cents (U. S.) per cubic meter. An evaluation of animal power used to operate a <b>Persian</b> <b>wheel</b> resulted with water costs that varied with the amount of feed required by the animal from 1 to 4 /m 3. Four pumping systems were investigated using conventional power systems: two diesel, one gasoline, and one electric. Since pumping systems have relatively fixed sizes and prices, the costs generally exceed the benefits for the small farmer. The cost per cubic meter for irrigating one hectare averaged: 3. 5 ¢ (U. S.) for diesel in Chad; 4. 0 ¢ (U. S.) for gasoline in Chad; 3. 5 Q (U. S.) for diesel in India; and 3. 0 t (U. S.) for electricity in India. In each of these instances, the cost of supplying small scale farmers with water using conventional systems was greater than the economic value of the water supplied. A fifth pumping system investigated herein utilized a high technology power system, photovoltaic cells combined with efficient electric motor and pump devices. The cost of providing water utilizing the photovoltaic power system resulted in costs of 2. 8 t/m 3 (U. S.) to lift the water 1. 5 m and 5. 44 /m 3 (U. S.) for lifting heads of 4. 5 m, at today's cell prices ($ 10 /Wp). If photovoltaic power system costs are reduced to $ 4. 00 per peak watt (Wp), the cost of irrigation water for a lift of 1. 5 m would be 1. 2 ¢/m 3, and for a lift of 4. 5 m would be 2. 3 */m 3.
