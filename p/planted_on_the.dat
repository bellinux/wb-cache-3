5|$|In 1902, two Port Orford cedar {{trees were}} <b>planted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{east side of}} City Hall. One tree was <b>planted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side and the second tree {{on the south side}} of the {{building}} to reinforce the symmetrical aspects of the building. The south tree was replaced in 1999 due to poor health. In 1910, the city added passenger elevators to the open stairwells.|$|E
5|$|Deciduous {{trees and}} {{plants have been}} {{promoted}} {{as a means of}} controlling solar heating and cooling. When <b>planted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of incident solar radiation, there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be <b>planted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s the mayor's {{office was}} refurbished, a new roof was installed, and new trees were <b>planted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grounds. In 1964, the city remodeled the City Council {{chambers}} {{on the second}} and third floors. Part of the work was to install new lighting to allow television broadcasts from the chamber, while other work added drop tiles to the ceiling, hiding the domed roof.|$|E
5|$|In the uplands of the island, an {{area that}} used to be lawn has been {{replaced}} with oak, hickory, ash, cherry, tree of heaven and sassafras. By the lighthouse, several openings in the shrubbery have been made to provide a variety of habitats for wildlife and a barrier of shrubs has been <b>planted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cliffs east of the lighthouse.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{started a}} {{pineapple}} plantation on Key Biscayne; six acres (two-and-a-half hectares) {{had been cleared}} and planted in pineapples in 1893–94. Davis also directed his caretaker to plant one-half to one acre (two-tenths to four-tenths of a hectare) of bananas. By 1898, {{a great variety of}} tropical fruit trees had been <b>planted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island. Davis also had a large dwelling built for his use. It was a two-story cottage with five bedrooms and verandas on three sides, raised ten feet above the ground on pilings to protect against storm surges.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian form Crljenak Kaštelanski was not bottled in Croatia as a varietal in its {{own right}} before the link to Zinfandel was revealed. UCD has since sent clones of both Zinfandel and Primitivo to Professor Maletić in Croatia, which he <b>planted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island of Hvar. He made his first ZPC wines in Croatia in 2005. There is high demand for red grapes in the country, and the {{government}} has been supportive of ongoing research. Figures from the department of viticulture and enology at the University of Zagreb claim that from only 22 vines of Crljenak Kaštelanski in Croatia in 2001, there were about 2,000 vines in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The plan works, in a way—Dallas can't resist {{insulting}} Hunsecker's methods, and, {{forced to}} choose between them, the timid Susan breaks up with Dallas in order to protect him from her brother. Hunsecker, however, is enraged by Dallas's insults to him after a brief confrontation. He decides to ruin the boy after all (against Falco's advice) and wants to have marijuana <b>planted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> musician, then have him arrested and roughed up by corrupt police Lt. Harry Kello (Emile Meyer).|$|E
5|$|Early in 1944, with an Allied {{invasion}} of Nazi-occupied Europe becoming ever more likely, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{was assigned to}} improve the wall's defences. Believing the existing coastal fortifications to be entirely inadequate, he immediately began strengthening them. Rommel's main concern was Allied air power. He had seen it first-hand when fighting the British and Americans in North Africa, and it had left a profound impression on him. He feared that any German counterattack would be broken up by Allied aircraft long before it could make a difference. Under his direction, hundreds of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built on the beaches, or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine guns, antitank guns, and light and heavy artillery. Land mines and antitank obstacles were <b>planted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beaches, and underwater obstacles and naval mines were placed in waters just offshore. The intent was to destroy the Allied landing craft before they could unload on the beaches.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to ripeness levels, the harvest yields {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality and flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when <b>planted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vigorous SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavors more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less vigorous rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after veraison.|$|E
5|$|Nag Nathaiya {{is celebrated}} {{on the fourth}} lunar day of the dark {{fortnight}} of the Hindu month of Kartik (October–November). It commemorates the victory of Krishna over the serpent Kaliya. On this occasion, a large Kadamba tree (Neolamarckia cadamba) branch is <b>planted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> banks of the Ganges so that a boy, {{playing the role of}} Krishna, can jump into the river on to the effigy representing Kaliya. He stands over the effigy in a dancing pose playing the flute, while an audience watches from the banks of the river or from boats. Bharat Milap celebrates the meeting of Rama and his younger brother Bharata after the return of the former after 14 years of exile. It is celebrated during October–November, a day after the festival of Vijayadashami. Kashi Naresh attends this festival in his regal attire. The festival attracts a large number of devotees.|$|E
5|$|Original to the house, and occupying its {{northwest}} terrace {{against its}} service wing, was an Italian garden with vine-clad pergolas on each side, symmetrical gravel paths, marble benches, and long stone balustrades, giving it {{characteristics of a}} hanging garden. The garden was below the house's first floor, and was built against the hillside, occupying {{a portion of the}} slope that falls far below it. The lower walls of the house were screened with a row of large cedars <b>planted</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> highest part of the garden. The garden formed an immense rectangular space, and on the four sides of the terrace there were pergolas thickly overgrown with vines. In the center was a pool and a carved stone fountain imported from Rome. Walks and beds of flowers and shrubbery occupied the rest, visible from the west-facing windows of the house.|$|E
