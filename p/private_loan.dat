[...] Moore's brigade arrived in January, but Moore {{spent most of his}} time traveling between Charleston and North Carolina, lobbying for funds and clothing for his poorly equipped soldiers, and recruiting more men. [...] He went so far as to obtain a <b>private</b> <b>loan</b> from Thomas Polk, a planter in Mecklenburg County, for $6,250 in South Carolina currency to pay for rations for his command. [...] Moore's unit engaged in daily drills under his supervision and that of Colonel Francis Nash. [...] Despite these efforts, the North Carolinians suffered from rampant colds and pneumonia, and many of the enlisted men deserted to join the South Carolina line because of the high bounty being offered by that state for service.|$|E
500|$|The keel for Salamis {{was laid}} down on 23 July 1913. The naval {{balance of power}} in the Aegean, however, was soon to change. The Brazilian Navy put their third {{dreadnought}} (...) up for sale in October 1913, and they found no shortage of countries interested in acquiring it, including Russia, Italy, Greece, and the Ottoman Empire. The British and French were also highly involved, given their interests in the Mediterranean; in November, the French agreed to back Greece with a large loan as a way of preventing Italy from acquiring the ship. Moreover, the Greek consul general in Britain claimed that the Bank of England was prepared to advance all of the money needed to purchase the ship as soon as a Grench loan was guaranteed. Arrangements for all this took quite some time, however, and at the end of December, the Ottomans were able to secure Rio de Janeiro with a <b>private</b> <b>loan</b> from a French bank.|$|E
2500|$|Kreuger invented another {{financial}} instrument, {{which continues}} to be used and is nowadays known as American Depositary Receipts. That issue was called Kreuger & Toll [...] "American Certificates". American investors had never seen an investment like this. It was part bond, part preferred stock, and part profit sharing option. The certificates enabled investors to gain exposure to a foreign company that had been paying dividends of 25 percent. It would be backed by the largest <b>private</b> <b>loan</b> to a foreign government (i.e. Germany) ever. Even {{in the midst of}} the growing panic investors went crazy for the issue and promised to buy 28 million dollars of the new securities. And this happened two days after Black Monday in 1929.|$|E

40|$|Student loan {{borrowing}} {{has increased}} dramatically {{in recent years as}} the cost of pursuing higher education has risen.
