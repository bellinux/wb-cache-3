5|$|Males’ sexual {{maturation}} is triggered by an increased proportion {{of light in}} the <b>photoperiod,</b> such that they are sexually mature when they colonize the field when the crop reaches leaf development. More specifically, a day length of 16h is required for the weevils to terminate their reproductive diapause. An optimal day length of 18h is found to induce diapause termination.|$|E
5|$|Established {{traits are}} not immutable; traits that have high fitness in one {{environmental}} context {{may be much}} less fit if environmental conditions change. In the absence of natural selection to preserve such a trait, it becomes more variable and deteriorate over time, possibly resulting in a vestigial manifestation of the trait, also called evolutionary baggage. In many circumstances, the apparently vestigial structure may retain a limited functionality, or may be co-opted for other advantageous traits in a phenomenon known as preadaptation. A famous example of a vestigial structure, {{the eye of the}} blind mole-rat, is believed to retain function in <b>photoperiod</b> perception.|$|E
5|$|In {{its natural}} habitat, N. rajah grows in open areas, {{where it is}} exposed to direct {{sunlight}} – it therefore needs to be provided with {{a significant amount of}} light in cultivation as well. To meet this need, many growers have used metal halide lamps in the 500–1000watt range, with considerable success. The plant should be situated a fair distance from the light source, 1 to 2 m is recommended. Depending on location, growers can utilise natural sunlight as a source of illumination. However, this is only recommended for those living in equatorial regions, where light intensity is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the plant. A <b>photoperiod</b> of 12hours is comparable to that experienced in nature, since Borneo lies on the equator.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{diversity}} within A. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important Allium crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong to this group. The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in <b>photoperiod</b> (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions, such as the Vidalia from Georgia, USA, or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E
5|$|All bovids mate {{at least}} once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} during the rainy months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily <b>photoperiod</b> plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundinga, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.|$|E
25|$|Initiation of {{flowering}} {{is sensitive to}} <b>photoperiod</b> and to sesame variety. The <b>photoperiod</b> also affects the oil content in sesame seed; increased <b>photoperiod</b> increases oil content. The oil content of the seed is inversely proportional to its protein content.|$|E
40|$|Photorefractoriness is the {{insensitivity}} of gonadal {{development to}} the stimulatory effects of long <b>photoperiods</b> in birds {{and to the}} inhibitory effects of short <b>photoperiods</b> in small mammals. Its molecular mechanism remains unknown. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that reciprocal expression of thyroid hormone-activating enzyme [type 2 deiodinase (Dio 2) ] and-inactivating enzyme [type 3 deiodinase (Dio 3) ] genes in the mediobasal hypothalamus is critical for photoperiodically induced gonadal growth. Since thyroid hormones are required not only for photoinduction, but also for the induction of photorefractoriness, we examined the expression of these genes in relation to photorefractoriness in birds and mammals. Transfer of birds to long <b>photoperiods</b> induced strong expression of Dio 2. This was maintained in tree sparrow when they later became photorefractory, but decreased somewhat in quail. In hamsters, transfer to long <b>photoperiods</b> also induced strong expression of Dio 2. High values were not maintained under long <b>photoperiods,</b> and, indeed, expression decreased at the same rate as in animals transferred to short <b>photoperiods.</b> There was no renewed expression of Dio 2 associated with testicular growth as animals became refractory to short <b>photoperiods.</b> Expression of Dio 3 was high under short <b>photoperiods</b> and low under long <b>photoperiods</b> in all the animals examined, except for the short photoperiod-refractory hamsters.

25|$|Strawberries {{are often}} grouped {{according}} to their flowering habit. Traditionally, this has consisted of a division between “June-bearing” strawberries, which bear their fruit in the early summer and “ever-bearing” strawberries, which often bear several crops of fruit throughout the season. Research published in 2001 showed that strawberries actually occur in three basic flowering habits: short-day, long-day, and day-neutral. These refer to the day-length sensitivity of the plant {{and the type of}} <b>photoperiod</b> that induces flower formation.

40|$|The role {{of light}} in cold {{acclimation}} of Hedera helix L. var. Thorndale appears to differ from that reported for winter annuals. Although light greatly enhances the degree of hardiness attained, cold acclimation is not obligatorily linked to a light requirement. <b>Photoperiods,</b> varying from 8 to 24 hours, received during the cold acclimation period were equally effective in promoting maximum hardiness. Relatively low light intensities and short <b>photoperiods</b> stimulated maximum hardiness, and proportional increases in hardiness in response to increased <b>photoperiods</b> were demonstrated only in stems of prestarved plants. Exclusion of CO 2 and high concentrations of photosynthetic inhibitors decreased hardiness, but in no instance was hardiness reduced {{to the level of}} the dark control. The data are only compatible with a photosynthetic role of light if it is assumed that only a small portion of the total photosynthates are required to elicit maximum hardiness. Alternatively, the light stimulation which was elicited by low light intensities, short <b>photoperiods,</b> in the absence of CO 2, and in the presence of photosynthetic inhibitors, may be a light signal similar to a phytochrome response...|$|R

25|$|Plant {{growth and}} {{development}} are mediated by specific plant hormones and plant growth regulators (PGRs) (Ross et al. 1983).

Following a 14 -week exposure to such <b>photoperiods</b> (hours of light: hours of darkness; 13 L: 11 D, 12 L: 12 D, 11. 5 L: 12. 5 D and 11 L: 13 D), the birds were subjected to a longer day length (16 L: 8 D) for another 9 weeks to test whether pre-treatment with varying <b>photoperiods</b> had an effect on subsequent long day photostimulation. There was a progressive increase in body mass under different pre-treatment <b>photoperiods,</b> with a faster increase in 11 L: 13 D and 11. 5 L: 12. 5 D than in 12 L: 12 D and 13 L: 11 D.

25|$|In autumn, aphids undergo sexual, oviparous reproduction. A {{change in}} <b>photoperiod</b> and temperature, {{or perhaps a}} lower food {{quantity}} or quality, causes females to parthenogenetically produce sexual females and males. The males are genetically identical to their mothers except they have one fewer sex chromosome. These sexual aphids may lack wings or even mouthparts. Sexual females and males mate, and females lay eggs that develop outside the mother. The eggs endure the winter and emerge as winged or wingless females the following spring. This is, for example, {{the life cycle of}} the rose aphid (Macrosiphum rosae, or less commonly Aphis rosae), which may be considered typical of the family. However, in warm environments, such as in the tropics or in a greenhouse, aphids may go on reproducing asexually for many years.|$|E
25|$|The {{transition}} from the vegetative phase to a reproductive phase involves {{a dramatic change in}} the plant’s vital cycle, perhaps the most important one, as the process must be carried out correctly in order to guarantee that the plant produces descendents. This transition is characterised by the induction and development of the meristem of the inflorescence, which will produce a collection of flowers or one flower, where only one is produced. This morphogenetic change contains both endogenous and exogenous elements: For example, in order for the change to be initiated the plant must have a certain number of leaves and contain a certain level of total biomass. Certain environmental conditions are also required such as a characteristic <b>photoperiod.</b> Plant hormones play an important part in the process, with the gibberellins having a particularly important role.|$|E
25|$|The estrous cycle (also spelled oestrous) {{controls}} when a mare is sexually receptive {{toward a}} stallion, {{and helps to}} physically prepare the mare for conception. It generally occurs during {{the spring and summer}} months, although some mares may be sexually receptive into the late fall, and is controlled by the <b>photoperiod</b> (length of the day), the cycle first triggered when the days begin to lengthen. The estrous cycle lasts about 19–22 days, with the average being 21 days. As the days shorten, the mare returns to a period when she is not sexually receptive, known as anestrus. Anestrus - occurring in the majority of, but not all, mares - prevents the mare from conceiving in the winter months, as that would result in her foaling during the harshest part of the year, a time when it would be most difficult for the foal to survive.|$|E

At sacrifice, testes of 14 L animals were large and showed full spermatogenesis and possessed tall columnar epithelial cells and secretion in the lumen of seminal vesicles. Transfer to 24 L, 8 L, or 0 L resulted in a decrease in testes size; the seminal vesicles had an epithelium with low columnar or cuboidal cells and contained a reduced amount of secretion in lumen.
