40|$|Structural {{batteries}} are multifunctional {{materials that are}} expected to perform multiple roles, i. e. power generation and mechanical support. Properly realized, the concept can dramatically improve gravimetric properties by elimination of <b>parasitic</b> <b>masses</b> tolerated in conventional devices. However, the significant structural loads that such batteries would be expected to bear, given their multiple roles, would exceed those experienced by conventional batteries, and thus must be studied and understood in the context of device safety, lifetime and cost. Key sources of mechanical stresses were identified and quantified in this effort, including manufacturing-induced loads, thermal loads, kinetic loads and structural loads. It was found that stresses due to compression during electrode fabrication can be as large as 2000 MPa, thus having the potential to induce mechanical failure of constituent materials, while stresses induced by structural loads in an unmanned vehicle example studied, were less than 1 MPa. Thermal stresses were found in one embodiment, to exceed 100 MPa, largely due to mechanical confinement of batteries embedded for structural support. Supporting experiments were conceived in this work to study the effect of loads on electrochemical performance. A novel design of a structural battery was developed, to simultaneously conduct mechanical and electrochemical experiments. Diffusion coefficients were determined while various loadings were applied. Also, stresses exerted on the battery were observed while the battery was charged and discharged. Statistically meaningful correlation was not observed for diffusion coefficients with respect to stresses, but forces applied to carbon fiber significantly varied during charging/discharging of batteries, and the magnitude of variance of force was strongly correlated with the number of charges. 	Molecular dynamics simulations, finally, were performed to examine findings from experiments. Diffusion coefficients of lithium ions were measured while graphite lattices were stressed. Simulation results differed substantially from experimental findings, in that substantial alterations in diffusivities were predicted with application of load. Future work should focus on rationalizing the differences in these elements, by development of improved experiments, and improved accounting for disorder, in simulations...|$|R

5000|$|The {{function}} of a sabot {{is to provide a}} larger bulkhead structure that fills the entire bore area between an intentionally designed sub-caliber flight projectile and the barrel, giving a larger surface area for propellant gasses to act upon than just the base of the smaller flight projectile (Drysdale 1978). Efficient aerodynamic design of a flight projectile does not always accommodate efficient interior ballistic design to achieve high muzzle velocity. This is especially true for arrow-type projectiles, which are long and thin for low drag efficiency, but too thin to shoot from a gun barrel of equal diameter to achieve high muzzle velocity. The physics of interior ballistics demonstrates why the use of a sabot is advantageous to achieve higher muzzle velocity with an arrow-type projectile. Propellant gasses generate high pressure, and the larger the base area that pressure acts upon the greater the net force on that surface. Force, pressure times area, provides an acceleration to the mass of the projectile. Therefore, for a given pressure and barrel diameter, a lighter projectile can be driven from a barrel to a higher muzzle velocity than a heavier projectile. However, a lighter projectile may not fit in the barrel, because it is too thin. To make up this difference in diameter, a properly designed sabot provides less <b>parasitic</b> <b>mass</b> than if the flight projectile were made full-bore, in particular providing dramatic improvement in muzzle velocity for APDS (Armor-piercing discarding sabot) and APFSDS ammunition. Seminal research on two important sabot configurations for long rod penetrators used in APFSDS ammunition, namely the [...] "saddle-back" [...] and [...] "double-ramp" [...] sabot was performed by the US Army Ballistics Research Laboratory during the development and improvement of modern 105mm and 120mm kinetic energy APFSDS penetrators(Drysdale 1978), permitted by the significant recent advancement in the computerized Finite element method in structural mechanics at that time; and now represents the existing fielded technology standard. (See for example the development of the M829 series of anti-tank projectiles beginning with the base model M829 in the early 1980s, to the recently fielded M829A4 model, employing ever longer [...] "double-ramp" [...] sabots). Upon muzzle exit, the sabot is discarded, and the smaller flight projectile flies to the target with less drag resistance than a full-bore projectile. In this manner, very high velocity and slender, low drag projectiles can be fired more efficiently, (see external ballistics and terminal ballistics). Nevertheless, the weight of the sabot represents <b>parasitic</b> <b>mass</b> that must also be accelerated to muzzle velocity, but does not contribute to the terminal ballistics of the flight projectile. For this reason, great emphasis is placed on selecting strong yet lightweight structural materials for the sabot, and configuring the sabot geometry to efficiently employ these parasitic materials at minimum weight penalty (Drysdale 1978).|$|E

The major thrust of the elimination strategy is interrupting transmission by anti-parasitic treatment of entire communities. However, both vector density and community microfilaria load (CMFL) influence the intensity of transmission. Therefore, using a logistic regression approach a relationship has been established between the Risk of Infection Index (RII), vector density and CMFL. The present analysis indicates {{that there is no}} risk of transmission as long as the CMFL is maintained below 5 microfilaria (mf) / 60  mm 3 and the vector density per man-hour (MHD) is 25 and CMFL is < 5  mf/ 60  mm 3.

Thus, the relationship has been depicted {{in the form of a}} probability matrix, which could be used for selecting an appropriate control strategy...|$|R

The first technique helped by the proteomic imaging leads to the localization of the candidates proteins for mass spectrometry analysis.

The space radiation environment beyond the magnetosphere is primarily a combination of two types of radiation: galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPE). While mitigating GCR exposure remains an open issue, reducing astronaut exposure to SPEs is achievable through material shielding because they are made up primarily of medium-energy protons. In order to ensure astronaut safety for long durations beyond low-Earth orbit, SPE radiation exposure must be mitigated. However, the increasingly demanding spacecraft propulsive performance for these ambitious missions requires minimal mass and volume radiation shielding solutions which leverage available multi-functional habitat structures and logistics as much as possible.

The cohort included patients after curative resection and patients who had unresectable lesions with stable disease or progressive infection. There were visible correlations of the crude antigen ELISA index and the presence and intensity of diagnostic bands in the Western blot. In most patients after curative resection, bands at 7, 16, and 18 kDa markedly decreased or vanished after 1 to 4 years. In a patient with a nonviable lesion (it died out), bands at 16 and 18 kDa vanished after 4 years. Among individuals with unresectable lesions but stable disease under antiparasitic chemotherapy, a decrease of all diagnostic bands was visible after 2 to 3 years in half of the patients, whereas the other half had unchanged blot results after 4 to 6 years. Patients with progressive disease showed increasing intensities of bands at 16, 18, and 7 kDa. The change of banding patterns was not influenced by the PNM stage in patients after curative surgery or with unresectable lesions. Our data indicate a correlation of the 7 -, 16 -, and 18 -kDa-Western blot bands with disease activity independent of the PNM stage.

The growth pattern resembles that of a malignant tumor with infiltration throughout the liver, spreading into neighbouring organs and metastases formation in distant organs. Thus, one of the prevailing differential diagnoses is liver cancer. Guided by the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) system of liver cancer, the European Network for Concerted Surveillance of Alveolar Echinococcosis and the WHO Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis proposed a clinical classification for alveolar echinococcosis. It was designated as PNM system (P = <b>parasitic</b> <b>mass</b> in the liver, N = involvement of neighbouring organs, and M = metastasis). As for TNM in oncology, single PNM categories were combined into four stages, I to IV.

All patients could be classified who had been diagnosed in the period from January 1998 to June 2005.

40|$|International audienceAlveolar {{echinococcosis}} (AE) of {{the liver}} caused by the metacestode of the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis {{is characterized by a}} multivesicular structure surrounded by an extensive fibro-inflammatory host reaction. The lesions behave like a slow-growing liver cancer, without sharp limits between the parasitic tissue and the liver parenchyma. Invasion of biliary and vascular walls is another hallmark of this severe disease. Moreover, the poor vascularization of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>mass</b> often leads to necrosis in {{the central part of the}} lesion. This explains why liver abscess due to superimposed bacterial infection of the necrotic area may occur in this disease. Currently, a range of imaging techniques can be used at the different stages of management of AE. For diagnosis, ultrasonography remains the first line examination. For a more accurate disease evaluation, aiming to guide the surgical strategy, computerized tomography, Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, including cholangio-MR imaging are of importance, providing useful complementary information. More recently, Positive-Emission Tomography using [18 F] fluoro-deoxyglucose has been developed for the follow-up of inoperable AE patients under long-term benzimidazoles therapy. This approach seems very promising to assess inflammatory activity and thereby to indirectly depict parasitic activity. Non-surgical interventional procedures, mainly percutaneous biliary and/or centro-parasitic abscesses drainages, are currently a major aspect in the care of incurable AE patients and have largely contributed to the improvement of survival in this situation during the past 20 years.

As NASA is engaged in developing new EDL systems and technologies via testing at Earth, instrumentation of existing Mars missions is providing valuable engineering data for performance improvement, risk reduction, and an improved definition of entry loads and environment. The most notable recent example is the Mars Entry, Descent and Landing Instrument (MEDLI) suite hosted by Mars Science Laboratory for its entry in Aug 2012.

When attached to a space vehicle, the thrust generated can propel the space vehicle to great distances at significant speeds. For optimal performance the sail must be kept from excessive vibration. Active control techniques can provide the best performance. However, they require an external power-source that may create significant <b>parasitic</b> <b>mass</b> to the solar sail. However, solar sails require low mass for optimal performance. Secondly, active control techniques typically require a good system model to ensure stability and performance. However, the accuracy of solar sail models validated on earth for a space environment is questionable. An alternative approach is passive vibration techniques. These do not require an external power supply, and do not destabilize the system. A third alternative {{is referred to as}} semi-active control. This approach tries to get the best of both active and passive control, while avoiding their pitfalls. In semi-active control, an active control law is designed for the system, and passive control techniques are used to implement it. As a result, no external power supply is needed so the system is not destabilize-able. Though it typically underperforms active control techniques, it has been shown to out-perform passive control approaches and can be unobtrusively installed on a solar sail boom. Motivated by this, the objective of this research is to study the suitability of a Piezoelectric (PZT) patch actuator/sensor based semi-active control system for the vibration suppression problem of solar sail booms.

The CubeSat Articulating Solar Array (CASA) provides the community with a solar array module compatible with the standardized CubeSat chassis, and compliant with the P-POD launch canister specification. This development included a bolt-on CASA module, which encompassed a launch restraint system, the deployable solar array, the articulating mechanism and associated control electronics. During the recently completed Phase II effort the CASA system was developed to TRL 5. This Phase II development focused on a 50 W point design, for a 3 U CubeSat. The innovation of the CASA deployable array system is twofold. First, CASA provides a very large, modular (i. e. scalable), solar panel area. This planar array stows within the standard P-POD volume that surrounds the nanosatellite spacecraft. On-orbit the CASA panels deploy into a co-planar operational configuration. Second, CASA utilizes shape-morphing composite slit-tube boom technology. This morphing composite structure serves multiple functions, thus eliminating <b>parasitic</b> <b>mass</b> and complexity of traditional mechanical systems. The boom provides all the necessary deployment actuation energy for the CASA solar array. Once deployed this same boom is the primary solar array structure that locates the array panels {{well away from the}} spacecraft (to prevent shading on the panels from the nanosatellite or nanosatellite payloads), and enable active pointing towards the sun. While multi-functionality results in an elegant final solution, the conflicting requirements presented significant design challenges. The proposed paper will describe the development, flight qualification, and near-term applications of the CASA technology, with a heavy focus on testing of the CASA Engineering Development Unit (EDU).

40|$|Inflatables have {{considerable}} packing efficiencies and allow simple deployment. This {{is due to}} their lack of stiffness when deflated, offering low cost solutions for space applications. After inflation, these typically soft systems could be improved using tape springs as structural stiffeners {{along the length of}} the boom, creating hybrid structures. These simple low cost single element components are easily stowed gaining strain energy in their collapsed state without permanent deformation providing additional potential to drive boom deployment. Combining both inflatable and tape spring components could create a superior hybrid boom with significant structural performance, whilst maintaining the advantages of gossamer structures. This research focuses on the structural performance improvement of adding tape springs to cantilever inflatable booms in over 40 experimental permutations. Applied tip loads identify the deflection response of these inflatable and hybrid booms, allowing a comparison between the two technologies. A computational hybrid boom model is developed alongside the experimental analysis using detailed material testing data of the inflatable fabric boom allowing an increased range of permutations and greater detail. The structural analysis has demonstrated the performance flexibility of hybrid booms where specific peak moment and rigidity requirements can be tailored through two key configurations; 2 opposed tape springs vertically aligned to the applied load and 4 tape springs in a cross formation square to the applied load respectively. A performance evaluation between the inflatable and hybrid booms shows significant potential whilst reducing the operational importance of maintaining pressurised systems. The greatest structural performance improvement is at 2. 5 PSI with an increase of over 8 and 10 times for peak moment and boom rigidity respectively. This is achieved when adding 4 tapes in a cross formation to the inflatable boom with an added mass of 105 %.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{self-healing}} materials has gained widespread acceptance {{in the research}} community. Over recent years a diverse array of bio-inspired self-healing concepts, from solid-state diffusion to liquid-phase healing in {{a broad range of}} engineering materials, embracing ceramics, polymers and fibre reinforced polymer composite materials have been proposed in the open literature. In this research study the liquid-phase healing of operational damage, namely impact damage, in advanced polymer composites is being addressed. The challenge of self-healing advanced fibre reinforced polymer composites is to obtain healing success without degrading the mechanical performance of host composite, a problem not encountered in the self-healing of generic polymeric systems. In the genre of self-healing fibre reinforced composite materials, autonomous healing is undertaken by a healing medium already located within the damage zone and released through the damage either passively or actively through human invention. This approach requires the 'engineering' control of the storage medium's toughness for release, and the development of bespoke resin chemistries to be compatible with the manufacturing route, i. e. they have to remain active whilst latent and then to recover full mechanical performance once a damage event occurs. This study has generated a proof of concept whereby the healing medium is only deployed to the damage site once a sensor has been triggered. The principle of the concept revolves around the ability of a reservoir to deliver a healing medium to a damage site via a network of vessels contained in the centerline of the composite laminate. Upon drop weight impact (10 Joules), delamination and microcracking connectivity between the pressurised vascule and those open to ambient led to a pressure loss which, {{with the use of a}} suitable sensor, triggers a pump to deliver a healing agent to the damage zone. Using this autonomous healing approach, near full recovery of post-impact compression strength was achieved (94 % on average).

The solution is to separate the functions of cryogen storage and in-flight thermal isolation, utilizing the unique physical conditions at balloon altitudes. Conventional dewars are launched cold: the vacuum walls necessary for thermal isolation must also withstand the pressure gradient at sea level and are correspondingly thick and heavy. The pressure at 40 km is less than 0. 3 % of sea level: a dewar designed for use only at 40 km can use ultra thin walls to achieve significant reductions in mass. This innovation concerns new construction and operational techniques to produce a lightweight liquid helium bucket dewar. The dewar is intended for use on high-altitude balloon payloads. The mass is low enough to allow a large (3 -to- 5 -meter) diameter dewar to fly at altitudes above 35 km on conventional scientific research balloons without exceeding the lift capability of the balloon. The lightweight dewar has thin (250 - micron) stainless steel walls. The walls are too thin to support the pressure gradient at sea level: the dewar launches warm with the vacuum space vented continuously during ascent to eliminate any pressure gradient across the walls. A commercial 500 -liter storage dewar maintains a reservoir of liquid helium within a minimal (hence low mass) volume. Once a 40 -km altitude is reached, the valve venting the vacuum space of the bucket dewar is closed to seal the vacuum space. A vacuum pump then evacuates the dewar vacuum space to provide the necessary thermal isolation. Liquid helium may then be transferred from the storage dewar into the bucket dewar to cool the telescope inside the bucket dewar. By splitting the functions of helium storage and in-flight thermal isolation, the <b>parasitic</b> <b>mass</b> associated with the dewar pressure vessel is eliminated to achieve factor-of-five or better reduction in mass. The lower mass allows flight on conventional scientific research balloons, even for telescopes 3 to 5 meters in diameter...|$|E
