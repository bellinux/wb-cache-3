5|$|The {{most common}} tactic used by Palestinians during the Intifada was {{throwing}} stones, molotov cocktails, and burning tires. The local leadership in some West Bank towns commenced non-violent protests against Israeli occupation {{by engaging in}} tax resistance and other boycotts. Israel responded by confiscating {{large sums of money}} in house-to-house raids. As the Intifada came to a close, new armed Palestinian groups—in particular Hamas and the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Jihad</b> (PIJ)—began targeting Israeli civilians with the new tactic of suicide bombings, and internal fighting amongst the Palestinians increased dramatically.|$|E

25|$|On April 27, two teenagers, aged 15 (though {{other sources}} cite their ages as 12 and 13), were arrested at a {{checkpoint}} near Jenin after 11 explosive charges {{were found on}} them. One teenager was recruited by the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Jihad</b> and the other by the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades.

25|$|On February 27, 2008, Hamas, the Popular Resistance Committees and the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Jihad</b> fired {{a rocket}} barrage, {{in which they}} fired {{for the first time}} six Grad {{missiles}} at the industrial city of Ashkelon.

25|$|On September 23, 2004, a {{day before}} Yom Kippur, the Shin Bet and the Israel Police {{announced}} their capture of a 15-year-old suicide bomber and a 7kg explosive belt {{in the village of}} Dir-Hana in the Western Galilee. The 15-year-old was part of joint terrorist cell of Tanzim and <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Jihad</b> from Yamon village near Jenin. The four were Palestinians who worked illegally in Israel. The 15-year-old was allegedly paid 1000 shekels in order to blow himself up in Afula.|$|E
25|$|Significantly, it was {{not until}} the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began {{training}} Palestinians. This is not to suggest that resistance fighters are underrepresented in the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan. Rather, large groups such as Hamas and <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Jihad</b> – which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects – have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This may have changed recently, because the Israeli security and intelligence services believe that al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for the right time to mount an attack.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October, clashes {{erupted in}} eastern Gaza between Hamas {{security}} forces {{and members of the}} powerful Heles clan (Fatah-affiliated), leaving up to two dead on both sides. Fatah and Hamas officials gave conflicting accounts of what caused the fighting but the dispute seems to have originated when Hamas officials demanded that the clan return a governmental car. Another gun battle on October 20 killed one member of the clan and a 13-year-old boy. During the same day, in Rafah, one woman was killed and eight people were injured when Hamas security members traded fire with Islamic Jihad activists. Two days later, 7 more Palestinians were killed in the internal fighting, including some Hamas militants and a <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Jihad</b> militant.|$|E

25|$|The attack {{shocked the}} Israeli public, and was {{classified}} by Amnesty International {{as a crime}} against humanity. On June 6, 2007, the IDF arrested Jihad Salah Saliman Abu Dahar, a <b>Palestinian</b> member of <b>Islamic</b> <b>Jihad</b> from the Khan Yunis area, who according to Shin Bet officials admitted to several acts of violence, including the attack on Hatuel and her daughters.|$|R
25|$|Despite Abbas's {{call for}} a {{peaceful}} solution, attacks by militant groups continued after his election, in a direct challenge to his authority. The <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Jihad</b> Movement in Palestine launched a raid in Gaza on 12 January 2005, that killed one and wounded three Israeli military personnel. On 13 January, Palestinians from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, Hamas, and the Popular Resistance Committees launched a suicide attack on the Karni crossing, killing six Israelis. As a result, Israel shut down the damaged terminal and broke off relations with Abbas and the Palestinian Authority, stating that Abbas must now show a gesture of peace by attempting to stop such attacks. Abbas was formally sworn in as the President of the Palestinian National Authority in a ceremony held on 15 January, in the West Bank town of Ramallah.|$|E
25|$|After {{the signing}} of the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993, Habash and the PFLP again broke {{completely}} with Arafat, accusing him of selling out the Palestinian revolution. The group set up an anti-Arafat and anti-Oslo alliance in Damascus, for the first time joined by non-PLO Islamist groups such as Hamas and the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Jihad,</b> which had grown to prominence during the First Intifada. After finding the position sterile, with Palestinian political dynamics playing out on the West Bank and Gaza areas of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Habash carefully sought to repair ties to Arafat, and gain a hold in post-Oslo politics without compromising PFLP principles. However, {{there is no indication that}} he ever accepted the two-state solution. This balancing act could not save the PFLP from being eclipsed by the militant Islamist factions on the one hand, and the resource-rich Fatah with its PNA patronage network on the other. The significance of the PFLP in Palestinian politics has diminished considerably since the mid-90s. The PFLP participated in the Palestinian legislative elections of 2006 as Abu Ali Mustafa won 4.2% of the popular vote.|$|E
25|$|The ending {{date of the}} Second Intifada is disputed, {{as there}} was no {{definite}} event that brought it to an end. Some commentators such as Sever Plocker consider the intifada to have ended in late 2004. With the sickness and then death of Yasser Arafat in November 2004, the Palestinians lost their internationally recognised leader of the previous three decades, after which the intifada lost momentum and lead to internal fighting between Palestinian factions (most notably the Fatah–Hamas conflict), as well as conflict within Fatah itself. Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip, announced in June 2004 completed in August 2005, is also cited, for instance by Ramzy Baroud, as signalling {{the end of the}} intifada. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas vowed in the days leading to the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005 that it would mark the end of the intifada. The summit resulted in Abbas declaring violence would come to an end, and Ariel Sharon agreeing to release 900 Palestinian prisoners and withdraw from West Bank towns, some consider this to be the official end of the Second Intifada, although sporadic violence still continued outside PA control or condolence. On February 8, 2005 Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced the cease-fire. Hamas and <b>Palestinian</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Jihad</b> (PIJ) refused to be parties to the agreement, the cease-fire being the position of the Palestinian Authority only. Five days later Abbass reached agreement with the two dissenting organisations to commit to the truce with the proviso that Israeli violation would be met with retaliation. Schachter addressed the difficulties in deciding when this intifada ended. He reasoned that suicide bombing was the best criterion, being arguably the most important element of second intifada-related violence, and that according to this criterion the intifada ended during 2005.|$|E
50|$|After {{splintering}} {{off from}} the PFLP, the PRFLP sought to align itself with the mainstream Fatah. They also attempted to distance itself from any Palestinians who thought the group to be jihad, as the PRFLP wanted to separate the struggles of the <b>Palestinian</b> people from <b>Islamic</b> <b>Jihad.</b> The PRFLP did not conduct any known terrorist attacks following its split from the PFLP, and instead served as a left-wing Marxists-Leninist political group.|$|R
