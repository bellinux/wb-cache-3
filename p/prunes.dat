5|$|Nonetheless, Hassinger still {{owned the}} rights to The Electric Prunes's name, and was {{encouraged}} {{by the success of}} Mass in F Minor, which prompted him to assemble a new line-up. He was steered toward the Colorado group, Climax, by Rich Fifield. Fifield had worked in fellow Colorado band, Hardwater (previously the surf rock band The Astronauts), which was managed by Poncher, and produced an album with Axelrod. The new Electric <b>Prunes</b> line-up included Climax members Richard Whetstone (vocals, guitar), John Herron (organ), and Mark Kincaid (guitar) with Brett Wade (bass guitar), who was recommended by The Collectors. With the group restructured, Axelrod, again, composed all the material for their next album, in the same vein as the previous effort, and centered it around the Jewish prayer, Kol Nidre. The album, titled Release of an Oath, utilized several session musicians including Howard Roberts, Carol Kaye, and Earl Palmer, and saw Whetstone as the only band member to contribute to the recordings. Although the album was considered more cohesive and progressive than its predecessor, it failed to chart upon its release in November 1968. Afterwards, Axelrod returned to his past position at Capitol Records, and The Electric <b>Prunes</b> toured as a supporting act for bands such as Steppenwolf, Canned Heat, and New Buffalo Springfield.|$|E
40|$|Null {{mutations}} in the <b>prune</b> gene of Drosophila melanogaster result in <b>prune</b> eye color due to reductions in red pigment accumulation. When one {{copy of the}} awd(Killer of <b>prune)</b> mutant gene is present in a <b>prune</b> background, the animals die. The cause of prune/Killer of <b>prune</b> lethality remains unknown. The genomic region characterized for the <b>prune</b> locus is transcriptionally active and complex, with multiple and overlapping transcripts. Despite the transcriptional complexity of the genomic region of <b>prune,</b> accumulated {{evidence suggests that the}} <b>prune</b> locus is small and consists of a single transcription unit, since every <b>prune</b> allele to date exhibits both <b>prune</b> eye color and prune/Killer of <b>prune</b> lethality. A functional <b>prune</b> product from a single, full-length cDNA was identified in this study that can rescue both the eye phenotype and prune/Killer of <b>prune</b> lethality.

40|$|<b>Pruning</b> of trees, {{in which}} some {{branches}} are removed from the lower crown of a tree, has been extensively used in China in silvicultural management for many purposes. With an experimental and modelling approach, the effects of <b>pruning</b> on tree growth and on the harvest of plant material were studied. In Chapter 2 the aboveground biomass production and harvest of plant material of five subtropical Chinese tree species as affected by annual <b>pruning</b> were analysed. The biomass production of trees decreased following <b>pruning,</b> and the reduction in biomass production was correlated with <b>pruning</b> intensity. The results indicated that, for the investigated five subtropical tree species, the annual <b>pruning</b> regime could not provide enough time for a tree to fully recover its growth, which consequently prevented the sustainable gain of high harvests of plant materials. In Chapter 3, the aboveground biomass allocation and leaf dynamics of four tree species following <b>pruning</b> were investigated. <b>Pruned</b> trees allocated proportionally more of their aboveground biomass to leaves and less to wood, irrespective of species and <b>pruning</b> seasons. This allocation pattern {{was positively correlated with}} <b>pruning</b> intensity. The increased proportional allocation of aboveground biomass to leaves following <b>pruning</b> would benefit <b>pruned</b> trees to alleviate the negative <b>pruning</b> effects and recover from the <b>pruning</b> damage. Chapter 4 focuses on the leaf emergence and shoot production of trees after <b>pruning.</b> <b>Pruning</b> had no effect on the leaf density and shoot production. <b>Pruning</b> facilitated the shoot production on the bare stem parts beneath the remaining crown. In Chapter 5 the leaf efficiency of two Ficus tree species as affected by <b>pruning</b> is reported. The leaf efficiency of both species was increased after <b>pruning.</b> In Chapters 6, a tree growth model was constructed. In Chapter 7, this tree model was applied to simulate the effects of <b>pruning</b> on branch harvest, taking <b>pruning</b> intensity, <b>pruning</b> season, <b>pruning</b> frequency, and tree size at which <b>pruning</b> starts into consideration. To sum up, the effects of <b>pruning</b> on tree growth depended on many factors including <b>pruning</b> season, <b>pruning</b> intensity, <b>pruning</b> interval, tree species, and tree size. Heavy and repeated <b>pruning</b> with short intervals reduced tree growth always. This negative effect, however, can be mitigated to some extent by the increased biomass partitioning to leaves and the increased leaf productivity in the <b>pruned</b> tree...|$|R
40|$|This work compares {{mechanical}} <b>pruning</b> {{followed up}} by hand <b>pruning</b> versus manual <b>pruning</b> {{in the case}} of ‘Fortune’ mandarins. Yield and fruit quality were measured over a three-year period. Two mechanical <b>pruning</b> intensities were tested, these intensities being measured as the width of the row middles left free after mechanical <b>pruning.</b> Although there were differences in biomass and diameter of the branches that were cut, no differences were observed between the two mechanical <b>pruning</b> intensities in terms of yield or fruit quality. In all <b>pruning</b> treatments, fruit size reached the highest category. The <b>pruning</b> treatments consisted in: (i) hand <b>pruning</b> every year, (ii) mechanical <b>pruning</b> followed up by hand <b>pruning</b> every year, and (iii) alternating the two previous methods over the years studied. On analysing the accumulated fruit production of the three years, it can be observed that {{there were no significant differences}} in yield when mechanical <b>pruning</b> was alternated with hand <b>pruning</b> over the years. When only mechanical <b>pruning</b> was used for the three years, however, a 22 % reduction in yield was observed with respect to the treatment involving hand <b>pruning</b> alone. From the economic point of view, mechanical <b>pruning</b> shortened the time needed to complete the follow-up hand <b>pruning</b> by 13 % with respect to just hand <b>pruning,</b> but this reduction in labour does not offset the cost of the mechanical equipment. </p...|$|R
5|$|To {{underscore}} {{that the}} feast represents an exotic bygone world of pre-partition Poland, Mickiewicz {{added to this}} a list of random dishes, ingredients and additives, whose names he found in Compendium ferculorum and which had already been forgotten in his own time: kontuza (soup of boiled and sieved meat), arkas (sweet milk-based jelly), blemas (blancmange), pomuchla (Atlantic cod), figatele (meatballs), cybeta (civet), piżmo (musk), dragant (tragacanth), pinele (pine nuts) and brunele (<b>prunes).</b> This {{is followed by a}} similar enumeration of various kinds of fish, whose names are likewise taken from the inventory at the beginning of Czerniecki's book.

5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and <b>prunes.</b> Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, {{this theory}} was updated, {{suggesting}} that a close relative of the beta-amyloid protein, and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that <b>prunes</b> neuronal connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by ageing-related processes in later life to cause the neuronal withering of Alzheimer's disease. N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's N-terminus, is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP {{by one of the}} same enzymes. N-APP triggers the self-destruct pathway by binding to a neuronal receptor called death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21). DR6 is highly expressed in the human brain regions most affected by Alzheimer's, so {{it is possible that the}} N-APP/DR6 pathway might be hijacked in the ageing brain to cause damage. In this model, beta-amyloid plays a complementary role, by depressing synaptic function.|$|E
