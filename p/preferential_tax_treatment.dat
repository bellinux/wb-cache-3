We find that TDA promotes home ownership, as households take advantage of the <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>treatments</b> for both TDA and home ownership. They substitute TDA assets for home equity by accumulating wealth in TDA and making smaller down payments (taking out bigger mortgages); consequently, they become homeowners earlier in their lives.

More foreign firms will enter the industry while certain existing host firms will have to exit.

30|$|The {{workings}} of IOS, that could {{at the same}} time serve as a narrative of what actually happened in Greece, may be summarized as follows: In non-competitive markets, the powerful civil servant and public corporation unions succeed in securing very high wages and incomes for their members. These wages lead, in turn, to very high prices for all state services (e.g., law and order, licensing, utilities, and almost all basic networks (e.g., power, water and sewage, phone, garbage disposal, rail, sea transport, oil refineries, natural gas)). The latter are both basic inputs in the economy’s production process. Hence, this implies important factor allocation distortions that jeopardize total factor productivity and overall competitiveness. In competitive, by their very nature, markets, economic power is expressed through market regulation {{in such a way as}} to ensure minimum compensations and <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>treatments</b> for the members of important professional associations (e.g., doctors, lawyers, notaries, engineers, pharmacists). These closed professions are typically unionized and limit entry into their ranks, through a variety of institutional barriers to labor mobility. Most importantly, however, they enjoy special tax privileges that enables them to avoid taxes. Minimum compensations work like the wages in the public sector and ΔΕΚΟ and <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> <b>treatments</b> increase disproportionally the tax burden of outsiders, leading likewise to lower total factor productivity and increased production costs throughout the economy. At the same time, the major political parties and government are influenced by the powerful unions and professional associations. In such a way, these elites cooperate in the governance of the country to ensure their interests (e.g., financing wages and salaries, develop and maintain the underlying public infrastructure and obtain favorable market restrictions and tax exemptions). But all this results in relatively high taxes and/or budget deficits and government borrowing. This leads to further distortions in the economy, further reducing total factor productivity, output, and growth. In relatively low stages of development, the advent of IOS may promote growth. However, as the power of insiders grows stronger, the detrimental effect of the abovementioned distortions becomes dominant. At such a point, the stronger the power of insiders, the lower is the level of TFP.|$|R

40|$|The Atkinson-Stiglitz Theorem {{shows that}} with weakly {{separable}} preferences, differential commod- ity taxes are not needed if an optimal nonlinear income tax is imposed. Redistributive objectives {{can be achieved}} with the income tax alone even if goods differ considerably in their income elasticities of demand. Deaton showed that {{if the government is}} restricted to a linear progressive income tax along with commodity taxes, the latter are superfluous if preferences are not only weakly separable but also yield linear Engel curves whose slopes are common to all households. These have potentially strong policy implications since they suggest that the common practice of giving <b>preferential</b> commodity <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> to necessities is not warranted. Using the linear progressive income tax as an example and assuming the Deaton conditions are satisfied, we derive two contradictory results. First, if the income tax is less progressive than optimal, necessities should be taxed preferentially relative to luxuries. Second, if low-income households are income-constrained so are unable to afford any luxury goods, it may be optimal to tax necessity goods at higher rates than luxuries, depending on whether labor supply varies along the intensive or extensive margin. The analysis is extended to allow for nonlinear taxes and endogenous demand for a public good...|$|R

40|$|This paper jointly models a landowner’s {{decision}} {{to develop a}} parcel and the option to enroll that parcel in a current use assessment program. The analytical results highlight different factors that influence {{the effectiveness of a}} current use program in delaying development. The results also underscore the difficulty a local government might have in influencing the behavior of the landowner. Except for altering eligibility rules, a local government employing current use assessment has but two policy tools: a penalty for development and the property tax rate. Key Words: current use assessment, development penalties, land-use change, pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits, property taxation, use value During the 20 th century, state and municipal gov-ernments in the United States witnessed an ongoing conversion of agricultural land and other forms of open space to metropolitan uses. As Morris (1998) has noted, “Since 1957, every state has responded to development pressures by allowing or requiring <b>preferential</b> property <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of farmland, and in some states other open space land. … [T]he most common policy assesses the land at its value in its current agricultural or open space use ” (p. 144). Such policies are known as current use (or use-value) assessment. With the sole exception of Mich-igan, every state employs some form of a current use assessment program. Because they are so wide-spread, we believe current use programs must be acknowledged in developing a theory that relates property taxation to land use patterns. This study focuses on the <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of prop-erties that are first enrolled in and then later with-drawn from current use assessment. In 15 states, th...|$|R

The remaining plants were generally inefficient, and most of these industries required significant investment to achieve productivity. Since then, there has been a growth in industry. Manufactured items in 2002 included beverages, processed foods, tobacco, leather, textiles, metal products, chemicals, printing, nonmetallic minerals, construction materials, salt, paper, and matches. The government sought privatization of these industries, and issued incentives such as exemptions from income <b>tax,</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>treatment</b> in allocation of foreign exchange for imports, and provisions for remittance of foreign exchange abroad.

40|$|<b>Preferential</b> {{property}} <b>tax</b> <b>treatment</b> of {{forested land}} {{is part of}} legislative policy in all 50 states. West Virginia's Managed Timberland (Managed Timberland) is designed to retain private forest land in forested use. In West Virginia, although private forest land owners hold 9. 7  million acres of forest land (83 % of forest land), Managed Timberland enrolled acres have remained at approximately 2  million acres since 1998. This lack of enrollment may be {{a cause for concern}} regarding the success and benefits of the program. This study evaluates West Virginia's Managed Timberland program, examines the factors that influence forest landowners' decision to participate in the program, and proposes strategies for increasing enrollment and improving the program. The data for this study were collected from a mail survey of participants and non-participants of the program conducted in the fall of 2008 on West Virginia forest landowners. Participants tended to hear about the Managed Timberland program from a professional forester and the majority of them were satisfied with the program administration. Aspects of the program that participants opposed most strongly were the annual contract renewal requirement and the tax assessors' overriding authority. Most participants (51 %) indicated that a longer contract time was a favorable change to the program. Many non-participants reported that they were not enrolled in Managed Timberland because they had never heard of the program. Although most non-participants were undecided as to whether they would enroll in the future, 25 % said they would consider it. Significant factors influencing enrollment were age, income, place of residence, county location of the enrolled property, and perceived benefits of the program.

30|$|The exact federal {{interpretation}} of the cooperative state law innovations is uncertain. The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922, which facilitates limited antitrust exemption to farm producers who are organized to collectively buy or sell products, {{may or may not}} apply to business organizations whose owners are not the users (Kelley 2001). As discussed by Ferrell (2002), on numerous occasions, the federal court ruled farmer cooperatives did not qualify for Capper-Volstead protection as some member patrons did not engage in agricultural production but only processing or investing. Similar uncertainty applies to eligibility for Subchapter T, which allows residual patron business income to be passed through by the cooperative to the member patron. Theoretically, a farmer cooperative is eligible for Subchapter T treatment if 50 % or more of its business is conducted on behalf of member patrons who are primarily farm producers. As discussed by Geu and Dean (2009 a), however, it is an open question if LCAs with member investor ownership may receive Subchapter T treatment as regulatory law is outside the scope and jurisdiction of the ULCAA. The potential loss of Capper-Volstead and Subchapter T eligibility is not without consequence. For example, Porter and Scully (1987) and Pasour and Rucker (2005) claimed the competitiveness of farmer cooperatives is in part driven or enhanced by <b>preferential</b> <b>tax</b> and antitrust <b>treatment.</b>|$|R
40|$|Nicaragua, {{the poorest}} country of Central American, gives shelter to many foreign owned plants in its free trade zones (export {{processing}} zones). In December 2006, some 80. 000 persons worked in these industrial zones. The {{great majority of}} these plants belong to the clothing industry {{and most of them}} are of Asian capital.

This paper tries to give some elements of answer to this question by studying the evolution of a Taiwanese maquiladora enterprise assembling jeans and casual wear in Nicaragua: Nien Hsing Textile Co. Our study casts doubts on the contribution of such a foreign enterprise to the development of a perennial local industrial structure: there are no backward linkages, the Nicaraguan employees are not qualified and realise manual and routine tasks, and management is mostly composed of expatriates. Moreover, our comparison between the situation in 2007 and the one in 1998 shows us that there have no been significant changes: the enterprise remains an economic enclave manufacturing a basic or standardized garment whose permanence in the country still depends on specific trade policy advantages (with an expiry date) enjoyed by Nicaragua.
