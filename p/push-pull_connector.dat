50|$|The <b>Push-pull</b> <b>connector</b> {{was invented}} by Swiss {{connectors}} manufacturer LEMO and {{is a type of}} cable interconnect that provides a strong locking mechanism that is only released by squeezing the connector body, preventing accidental disconnects. The connector is cylindrical, enabling a wide range of body styles and configurations such as low or high voltage multipin, coaxial, triaxial, fluid and gas.Fischer Connectors and Lemo are well-known Swiss manufacturing company that are leaders in developing and manufacturing broad range of circular push-pull connectors.|$|E

50|$|FC connectors' {{floating}} ferrule provides good mechanical isolation. FC connectors {{need to be}} mated {{more carefully}} than <b>push-pull</b> type <b>connectors</b> due {{to the need to}} align the key, and due to the risk of scratching the fiber endface while inserting the ferrule into the jack. FC connectors have been replaced in many applications by SC and LC connectors.|$|R
