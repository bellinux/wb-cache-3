5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} the new phenomenon this writer found is in an article, entitled [...] "About the Electrical Television", written by Kalman Tihanyi and published on May 3, 1925, nearly one year prior to his first application for patent on an all-electronic television system. Although the inventor does not use the term [...] "storage principle" [...] of [...] "storage effect", {{the description of the}} new phenomenon he had discovered implies that that is exactly what he had in mind. Thus, he wrote:"The writer of this article has studied thoroughly all phenomena known from {{the current state of the}} physical sciences which could be applied to the solution of the problem and on the basis of control calculations found them unfit for the achievement of the minimally required 1/80,000 s efficiency at the transmitting station. However, during experimentation a new physical phenomenon was discovered, under which the optical and the electrical effect is practically simultaneous. In fact displacement between the two effects could not be detected with our instruments, although the possibility exists for a displacement of 1/400,000,000 of a second based on Maxwell's equations in regard to a related phenomenon. This means that under this phenomenon not only the desirable 1/150,000 second changes, but 1/400 million changes can be followed" [...] (K. Tihanyi: [...] "Az elektromos távolbavetítésről" [...] ("About electric teleprojection"), Nemzeti Újság magazine, May 3, 1925, p. 23). (Emphasis added.)An investigation of various dictionaries and lexicons confirms that, indeed, in addition to the photoelectric (or <b>photoemissive)</b> <b>effect,</b> storage television technology also involves an entirely different phenomenon.Evident from these characterizations is that while under the photoelectric effect bound electrons released from such photosensitive materials vary linearly with the frequency of the radiation, [...] "that is for each incident photon an electron is ejected", under the storage effect a photoconductive and photovoltaic phenomenon occurs where ("apart from the liberation of electrons from metals") when photons are absorbed in a p-n junction (in a semiconductor) or metal-semiconductor junction, [...] "new free charge carriers are produced", (photoconductive effect) and where [...] "the electric field in the junction region causes the new charge carriers to move, creating a flow of current in an external circuit without the need for a battery", (photovoltaic effect) (The International Dictionary of Physics and Electronics, N.Y. 1956, 1961, pp. 126, 183, 859-861, 863, 1028-1028, 1094-1095).The Concise Dictionary of Physics under the heading, [...] "Photoelectric Cells", differentiates between [...] "the original photocells" [...] (which utilized photoemission form a photosensitive surface and their attraction by the anode) and [...] "the more modern photocells which utilize the photoconductive and photovoltaic effect" [...] (The Concise Dictionary of Physics, Oxford, 1985).|$|E

The {{aim of the}} work is to solve extinction problems within the framework of roentgen standing waves method and to study mechanisms of indirect stimulation of secondary radiation. A series of curves for outgoing electrons and fluorescent radiation generated by crystals has been obtained accounting for possible mechanisms of indirect stimulation by roentgen radiation. A possibility for implementation of the developed two-channel method for roentgen standing waves has been shown in order to investigate structural refining of the near-surface layers of multicomponent crystals and to determine host and impurity atoms position in a crystal sellAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
