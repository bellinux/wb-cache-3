50|$|The {{witnesses}} {{interviewed by}} the newspaper and later by the Institute, claimed that several dozen Poles (by 2003 IPN has confirmed 7 deaths by name) were massacred on that day, possibly around 50. Among those killed were local officials (including teachers and <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>personnel),</b> {{as well as the}} members of the szlachta family of Wołkowicki, including Count Antoni Wołkowicki, his wife and his mother buried alive. The IPN described the murders as having been carried out by village dwellers mostly from Padbahoniki. The pro-Communist squads organized around the anti-Polish Skidal revolt welcomed the Soviet invasion of Poland which had taken place a day before. Tens if not hundreds of such incidents took place around Grodno county, wrote IPN historian Marek Wierzbicki.|$|E

40|$|In Britain {{during the}} Second World War, the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> {{constituted}} {{the single largest}} employer of women. Historically, the <b>Post</b> <b>Office,</b> like many other employers, had discriminated against women.

Unlike World War I, World War II, however, proved to a real {{turning point in the}} <b>Post</b> <b>Office's</b> <b>personnel</b> practices. By the end of the Second World War, while the <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> still did not treat women workers completely equally (persisting, for instance, in gender-biased pay practices), management nevertheless had made strides in their treatment and perception of women workers. <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> executives increasingly perceived women on the payroll not as temporary wartime employees, but as permanent employees, who would be just as essential peacetime as in war...|$|R

40|$|Mystery {{shopping}} {{is a tool}} often used for evaluation of providing services quality. It is also a tool, which enables to examine and evaluate communication skills of employees {{in order to identify}} their weakness and define the way of improvement. The reason is that their applied abilities are connected with customer´s total perception of providing services. National post operators must learn to listen to their customers through their employees. This process is crucial for the market environment – it enables to gain customer´s loyalty and trust. In order to ensure higher level of customer oriented behaviour between the employees, Slovak Post starts a pilot project called "Mystery Customer".

40|$|As {{part of a}} Research Project {{into the}} Cost Effectiveness of Training, various {{experiments}} were held in Telephone Exchanges in the Midland, Eastern and London Telecomrnunications Regions. The purpose of the experiments {{was to investigate the}} work load of telephonists,to see how {{the amount of time spent}} on the elements of the task done might vary as the training of the telephonists proceeded and also to attempt to compare two methods of training. Data from these experiments and from other sources in the literature was used to compare the efficiency of a selection of models of learning. The method of comparison was based on an extension of an iterative 2 -parameter curve fitting algorithm which uses a Taylor Series approximation to the function of the model of learning investigated. The resulting analysis allowed a tentative choice of what might be called the "best" model, which was then used in a more detailed examination of further data obtained on telephonists. In the event, the curve fitting analysis was found to be complex, as was the apparently simple task of "telephonist", Time did not allow an extension of the study into other tasks performed by <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>personnel...</b>|$|E
