25|$|The thermoregulatory model {{explaining}} {{the origin of}} bipedalism {{is one of the}} simplest theories so far advanced, but it is a viable explanation. Dr. Peter Wheeler, a professor of evolutionary biology, proposes that bipedalism raises the amount of body surface area higher above the ground which results in a reduction in heat gain and helps heat dissipation. When a hominid is higher above the ground, the organism accesses more favorable wind speeds and temperatures. During heat seasons, greater wind flow results in a higher heat loss, which makes the organism more comfortable. Also, Wheeler explains that a vertical posture minimizes the direct exposure to the sun whereas quadrupedalism exposes more of the body to direct exposure. Analysis and interpretations of Ardipithecus reveal that this hypothesis needs modification to consider that the forest and woodland environmental <b>preadaptation</b> of early-stage hominid bipedalism preceded further refinement of bipedalism by the pressure of natural selection. This then allowed for the more efficient exploitation of the hotter conditions ecological niche, rather than the hotter conditions being hypothetically bipedalism's initial stimulus.

40|$|Global {{warming and}} ocean {{acidification}} (OA) have {{increased over the}} last decades, affecting coral reefs in various ways. Temperature stress may disrupt the photosymbiosis between corals and their microalgal symbionts and lead to photoinhibition, bleaching and mortality of the corals.

Coral reefs may cope with global warming and OA both, on the organismal level, where adaptive bleaching may foster coral associations with heat-tolerant Symbiodinium clades, and on the ecosystem level, where coral communities may become dominated by less bleaching and OA-susceptible species. Here, I show that reef environments displaying high natural fluctuations in temperature and pH due to upwelling by internal waves are important refuges for corals in a changing world.

These two topics, although seemingly unrelated, bring much new information and thus contribute to the better understanding of solitary bee biology that is still insufficiently known. Although the solitary behaviour represents the necessary original state {{for the evolution of}} higher sociality or obligate cleptoparasitism, its role is largely unappreciated. Furthermore, intraspecific cleptoparasitism, which is an alternative and facultative nesting strategy in bees, is a probable antecedent state of obligate cleptoparasitism. Although the obligate cleptoparasitism is a very common strategy in solitary bees, the information about the frequency and the occurrence of intraspecific cleptoparasitism in solitary bees is rare. We studied the nesting behaviour of solitary bees to detect different behavioural patterns that could serve as <b>preadaptations</b> to sociality or cleptoparasitic behaviour and we also focused on the detection and description of intraspecific cleptoparasitism in solitary bees.

40|$|The {{regularity}} of spiders orb webs {{has been}} considered a fascinating natural wonder by generations of naturalists. Although the majority of spider species build irregular three-dimensional networks, those who have evolved the two- dimensional spiral snare have drawn {{most of the attention}} (Vollrath, 1988). Even studies conducted on irregular webs are often explicitly devoted to the search of similarities with orb webs, resulting from behavioral <b>preadaptations</b> to this specific design (Eberhard, 1987, 1992).

In the overall context of swarming in the cooperative spider Anelosimus eximius (Furey et al, in prepa- ration), our focus was on amplification mechanisms involved in group cohesion and coordination of several individuals' activities.

This evolutionary hypothesis complicates the identification of morphological or physiological <b>preadaptations</b> that might have permitted the common ancestor of tetrapods to colonize land.

We hypothesize that horizontally transferred genes could be advantageous for food processing in a soil environment that is full of decaying organic material. Finally, we identified several lineage-specific genes, expanded gene families, and horizontally transferred genes, associated with altered gene expression as a consequence of genetic adaptation to metal stress.

A very recent morphological mutation, flatwing, has caused the loss of male song in field crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus) from the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Previous studies in this and related species have shown that females require male courtship song to mount males, but flatwing T. oceanicus males still achieve matings. Females from Kauai may have a relaxed requirement for male courtship song, or flatwing males may compensate for their inability to sing by altering other courtship behaviors. We tested whether male courtship and female responses to male courtship were preadapted {{in a way that}} facilitated the spread of the male wing mutation or if parallel changes in male courtship and female responses accompanied the mutation. We performed mating trials in 2 captive-bred populations to assess how mating behavior varied depending on {{the presence or absence of}} courtship song playback. The first was an ancestral population from Kauai established prior to the emergence of the flatwing mutation, and the second was derived from Kauai after the mutation became prevalent. Mating behaviors did not differ qualitatively or quantitatively between the ancestral and current populations, and females from both accepted males for mating in the absence of courtship song. Our results provide direct evidence that a mechanism allowing flatwing males to mate with females was in place before the mutation actually arose on Kauai and demonstrate how preexisting behavior facilitated the rapid spread of a novel morphological mutation.

In addition, legumes vary in ability to form compartments harboring endosymbiotic rhizobia and located intercellularly (infection threads) and intracellularly (symbiosomes). Using pea (Pisum sativum) symbiotic mutants, the nodule developmental program is dissected into a range of spatially and temporarily di!erentiated steps comprising four sub-programs (development of endosymbiotic compartments; nodule histogenesis; autoregulation of nodulation; bacteroid di!erentiation). The developmental mutations are suggested {{in some cases to}} reverse the endosymbiotic system into the morphologically simpler forms some of which may correspond to the ancestral stages of nodule evolution. The origin of legume}rhizobial and actinorhizal symbioses is suggested to be based on a set of <b>preadaptations</b> many of which had been evolved in angiosperms during coevolution with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (e. g., inter- and intracellular maintenance of symbionts, their control via defence-like reactions and recognition of chitin-like molecules). An analysis of parallel morphological variation in symbiotic mutants and wild-growing legume species enables us to reconstruct the major stages of evolution for N 2 -"xing symbioses...|$|R
