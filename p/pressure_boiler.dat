25|$|Based on {{the success}} of the {{prototype}} A2 572, a total of 125 Stephenson valve gear A2 locomotives were built between 1907 and 1915. The design was then altered to incorporate larger diameter cylinders, a higher <b>pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> and Walschaerts valve gear, and a further 60 locomotives of this design were produced between 1915 and 1922.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{desirable}} if high heat is {{recovered from the}} exiting gases. Hence dual <b>pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> is employed for this purpose. It has two water/steam drums. Low pressure drum is connected to low pressure economizer or evaporator. The low pressure steam is generated in low temperature zone. The low pressure steam is supplied to the low temperature turbine. Super heater can be provided in the low pressure circuit.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Victorian Railways still ran express {{passenger}} trains with the successful but ageing B class 2-4-0 which dated back to 1862. The 'New A' class 4-4-0 of 1889 had {{proven to be}} a successful design, as had its close cousin and exact contemporary the X class 0-6-0. With traffic needs continuing to grow, the VR drafting office decided to take the best features of the New A and X class, but enlarge the locomotive with a larger, higher <b>pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> and larger cylinders.|$|E

500|$|The London and North Eastern Railway LNER Gresley Classes A1 and A3 {{locomotives}} represented {{two distinct}} {{stages in the}} history of the British [...] "Pacific" [...] steam locomotives designed by Nigel Gresley. They were designed for main line passenger services, initially on the Great Northern Railway (GNR), a constituent company of the London and North Eastern Railway after the amalgamation of 1923, for which they became a standard design. The change in class designation to A3 reflected the fitting to the same chassis of a higher <b>pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> with a greater superheating surface and a small reduction in cylinder diameter, leading to an increase in locomotive weight. Eventually all of the A1 locomotives were rebuilt, most to A3 specifications, but no. 4470 was completely rebuilt as Class A1/1.|$|E
2500|$|Eliza Anderson was {{launched}} on November 27, 1858, at Portland, Oregon for the Columbia River Steam Navigation Company. [...] She was a sidewheeler {{driven by a}} low <b>pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> generating steam for a single cylinder walking-beam steam engine She was built entirely of wood, measuring 197' long, 25.5 feet on the beam, and rated at 276 tons capacity.|$|E
2500|$|Thirty-five {{to forty}} rail cars entered the tunnel each day, pulled by a [...] "hot water bottle" [...] locomotive. It was {{specially}} {{designed to prevent}} smoke in the main line and its six spurs in the tunnels by being charged with steam, which would last from four to five hours from a central, high <b>pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> under the office building. A 1924 Santa Fe Magazine article called the engine a [...] "unique feature in locomotive construction, only one other of its type being in existence." [...] They remained in service until about 1950, when diesel locomotives assumed the duty. Rail cars carried goods into the buildings and then the 21 freight elevators lifted merchandise to upper-level showrooms and first-floor trucking platforms.|$|E

5000|$|When {{they were}} first introduced, their <b>boiler</b> <b>pressure</b> was set at , giving a {{tractive}} effort of 45500 lbf kN at 75% <b>boiler</b> <b>pressure.</b> Since they tended to be slippery, however, the operating <b>boiler</b> <b>pressure</b> was reduced to [...] in 1933, resulting in a corresponding reduction in tractive effort to 35890 lbf kN at 75% <b>boiler</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
25|$|Two of {{the most}} {{transformative}} technologies of the century were widely introduced during the early decades: electrification, powered by high <b>pressure</b> <b>boilers</b> and steam turbines and automobiles and trucks powered by the internal combustion engine.|$|R
2500|$|Designed as a {{cruising}} cutter for Bering Sea service, Manning {{was built}} by Atlantic Works, East Boston, Massachusetts, for the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service. She was accepted by Captain R.M Clark for the Revenue Cutter Service on 11 August 1897. She commissioned on 8 January 1898 and was assigned cruising grounds along the New England coast. Her lines were those of ancestral clipper cutters, but with a plumb bow instead of the more graceful clipper stem. She was powered by a 2,181 horsepower triple expansion steam engine and utilized a coal fired high <b>pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> which allowed {{a top speed of}} 17 knots. The hull was of composite construction with frames placed at two foot intervals with 3/8 inch steel plate and sheathed from her bottom to two feet above the waterline with five inch thick Oregon fir planks. Below the waterline Manning was sheathed in copper and had eleven watertight bulkheads. The composite design was thought at the time better to weather the ice conditions of the Bering Sea. As tensions mounted before the Spanish–American War was declared, she carried a single bow torpedo tube. Manning and her sister ships USRC Gresham, USRC McCulloch, USRC Algonquin, and [...] were the last cruising cutters rigged for sail and carried the first electric generators installed on cutters. As a class, they were suitable for scouting, for rendering assistance, and for cruising at moderately long range. So successful was the design that these cutters furnished the general pattern for cutter construction for the ensuing 20 years.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Tejo Power Station, whose buildings {{no longer}} exist, {{was built in}} 1909 and operated until 1921. In 1914, construction began on the low <b>pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> buildings and the machinery room, which were later expanded several times. Finally, in 1941 construction on the high <b>pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> building took place, the power station’s largest structure, which was expanded in 1951 {{with the addition of}} another boiler.|$|E
50|$|The total {{carryover}} is a sum of {{the mechanical}} and vaporous carryover. The vaporous carryover generally increases with increasing steam pressure.

50|$|With the {{destruction}} of the original Tejo Power Station and the installation of the high <b>pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> building, the need arose for space for workshops and storage space. Thus the CRGE purchased the properties adjoining {{the eastern side of the}} complex, where the old Senna Sugar Estates, Ltd. sugar refinery-owned by the Companhia de Açúcar de Moçambique (Mozambique Sugar Company) -used to operate. It was also necessary to create an auxiliary room for water treatment, which was installed inside the low <b>pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> building, thus dismantling the first two boilers.|$|E

25|$|The {{first was}} a higher <b>boiler</b> <b>pressure</b> than was {{normally}} used on British merchant ships. Alfred Holt had experimented with a <b>boiler</b> <b>pressure</b> of 60 psi in the Cleator, a ship he used as a floating testbed. Holt overcame the Board of Trade's objections to <b>boiler</b> <b>pressures</b> above 25 psi in seagoing vessels.|$|R

Hydrolysis of trisodium phosphate is a pH buffer in equilibrium with disodium phosphate and sodium hydroxide.|$|R
50|$|In 1948, {{due to the}} {{escalating}} price of coal, the three high <b>pressure</b> <b>boilers</b> were slightly altered to adapt them to burn naphtha (fuel oil), a petroleum by-product {{that at the time}} was cheaper than coal. It was also necessary to build an 8 000m3 reservoir near the Praça de Carvão (Coal Square) to store this flammable liquid.|$|R
50|$|With the {{construction}} of the low <b>pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> building and the new machinery room, the Tejo Power Station began to consolidate itself both in terms of production and on an architectural level, with the use of brick on the visible facades of the entire industrial complex.|$|E
50|$|The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Class G2A was a {{class of}} 0-8-0 steam locomotives.

40|$|An {{existing}} {{power plant}} can be repowered at a modest investment cost through a topping turbine installation. Essentially, {{this consists of}} replacing the existing old, low <b>pressure</b> <b>boilers</b> with new, high <b>pressure</b> <b>boilers</b> and adding a new, high pressure, non-condensing turbine (topping turbine). The high pressure steam generated in the new boilers is supplied to the throttle of the high pressure turbine and exhausted at the pressure required by the existing, old, low pressure, condensing turbines. The exhaust from the topping turbine is then supplied to the throttle of the existing turbines. The additional capacity results from the kilowatts generated in the topping turbine while reducing the steam pressure from the throttle to the exhaust conditions. Also, because this steam is not condensed, there is no loss of the latent heat of condensation of the steam to the condenser circulating water. Consequently, the thermal efficiency of the cycle is considerably enhanced...|$|R
25|$|Orizaba and {{her sisters}} had turbo-electric transmission. Each ship had two oil-fired high <b>pressure</b> <b>boilers</b> that fed a single AEG turbo generator. This {{produced}} current for an AEG electric propulsion motor that drove a single propeller shaft. This was a sophisticated propulsion system that required skilled operation. Both Antilla and Arauca suffered technical failures on their maiden voyages to the Caribbean.|$|R
50|$|Churchward {{experimented with}} compounding, a {{principle}} development for marine engines which was widely adopted in European locomotive design. Although through his experimentation Churchward found {{little difference in}} operation the total power developed in compounding locomotives, the use of European locomotives in his trial led to his adoption of higher <b>pressure</b> <b>boilers,</b> and drive power split between two axles on four cylinder designs.|$|R
