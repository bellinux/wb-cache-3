5000|$|It {{has been}} {{originally}} released in an edition of 300 copies on transparent purple vinyl. There were 3 different sleeves: 225 were B/W xeroxed, 75 {{in color and}} 15 (only given to the bands and friend(s) were {{a variation of the}} B/W sleeve with color added. Some inserts contained messages like 'Natas si dog' and all featured lyrics and number <b>pressed.</b> The <b>sleeve</b> shows a photo of a family party at Rune's with his father Aslak (Norwegian jazz musician) playing saxophone. Aslak has also laid down some sax-tracks on [...] "Humiliation Street" [...] for the Apocalypse Dudes LP.|$|R
5000|$|Gillan is {{the first}} album by British rock band Gillan, {{released}} in September 1978. It was only released in Japan, Australia and New Zealand, but the album sold well in the UK as an import, aided by positive <b>press</b> reviews. The <b>sleeve</b> notes of the original release credit Liam Genocky as playing drums and percussion, while the 1993 release [...] "Gillan - The Japanese Album" [...] instead credits Pete Barnacle.|$|R
25|$|Sun Ra {{became a}} fixture in Philadelphia, {{appearing}} semi-regularly on WXPN radio, giving lectures to community groups, or visiting the city's libraries. In the mid-1970s, the Arkestra sometimes played free Saturday afternoon concerts in a Germantown park near their home. At their mid-1970s shows in Philadelphia nightclubs, someone stood {{at the back of}} the room, selling stacks of unmarked LPs in plain white <b>sleeves,</b> <b>pressed</b> from recordings of the band's live performances.|$|R
50|$|The cloth is {{continually}} {{fed into the}} sanforizing machine and therein moistened with either water or steam. A rotating cylinder <b>presses</b> a rubber <b>sleeve</b> against another, heated, rotating cylinder. Thereby the sleeve briefly gets compressed and laterally expanded, afterwards relaxing to its normal thickness. The cloth to be treated is transported between rubber sleeve and heated cylinder and is forced to follow this brief compression and lateral expansion, and relaxation. It is thus shrunk.|$|R

50|$|The {{front cover}} sees the band {{standing}} in front of Chalk Farm tube station in Camden. When the original vinyl was released the first, more sombre, cover photograph was changed to a more animated pose after around 10,000 albums were <b>pressed.</b> The two <b>sleeves</b> can be distinguished by Mike Barson's holding of the umbrella: in the earlier pressing he holds it up to his chin while in the later, and subsequently used, releases the umbrella is on the ground.|$|R
50|$|Lawrence {{then began}} work on a new Formula Junior car {{in which he would}} apply lessons learned from Keith Duckworth, whom he had met when picking up the engines for the DS101s. This led to his {{developing}} a unique suspension system for the car. To get more power out of the engine Lawrence drilled a hole directly down into the cylinder head and <b>pressed</b> a <b>sleeve</b> into the hole, creating a new intake port and blocking off the old at the same time. On the now high-mounted intake manifold he added a set of second-hand 45DC3 carburetors that drew cold air in over the driver's head. The VW transaxle was retained, but was mounted upside-down to drop the crankshaft below the height of the driveline. This car, christened the DS104, was taken to Silverstone for testing, where it was discovered that the crown-wheel was fitted to {{the wrong side of the}} pinion, resulting in the car having one forward gear and four reverse. The crown-wheel was subsequently moved. The DS104 debuted at Oulton Park, where it won on its first outing.|$|R
60|$|Never had Boldwood been so fastidious, {{unreasonable}} {{about the}} fit, and generally difficult to please. The tailor walked {{round and round}} him, tugged at the waist, pulled the <b>sleeve,</b> <b>pressed</b> out the collar, {{and for the first}} time in his experience Boldwood was not bored. Times had been when the farmer had exclaimed against all such niceties as childish, but now no philosophic or hasty rebuke whatever was provoked by this man for attaching as much importance to a crease in the coat as to an earthquake in South America. Boldwood at last expressed himself nearly satisfied, and paid the bill, the tailor passing out of the door just as Oak came in to report progress for the day.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The copper sleeve {{press-fit}} {{machine is}} a kind of device applied in automobile parts processing. The machine is used to <b>press</b> nine copper <b>sleeves</b> into a mold with nine holes. An automatic control system based on PLC is designed. CPU 224 of Siemens S 7 - 200 series PLC is adopted as the core controller. The machine can be operated by either the human-machine interface or the pushbutton panel. There are all ten cylinders in this machine. The operation sequence and interlock protection of the ten cylinders are controlled by the PLC. In this system there are some necessary fault alarms and protective measures. The machine can be operated in manual mode or automatic mode. The press-fit machine is designed to operate simple with the high degree of automation and reliability, thereby saving work force and enhancing the efficiency of automobile parts production...|$|R
50|$|Get Behind Me Satan was, for ten years, {{the only}} album by The White Stripes {{to not be}} commercially {{released}} in a vinyl format. The reason behind it was because The White Stripes had intended to re-record Get Behind Me Satan entirely live in a New Zealand studio and wanted {{that to be the}} official vinyl version. However, the studio that they were planning to record it in no longer had the recording equipment to make it possible. As a result, at the time there was never a commercially released vinyl version of the album. Yet, {{there are only a few}} copies of the album on vinyl LP that were given exclusively to music journalists for review, which have since become coveted collector's items. They were released by both XL Recordings and V2 Records and each label had only 300, making the total 600 and highly rare. However, for Record Store Day 2015, Jack White's Third Man Records are releasing a limited vinyl edition with a lenticular gatefold <b>sleeve,</b> <b>pressed</b> on red and white vinyl. A commercially released version with standard artwork pressed on standard black vinyl will be released later in the year.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Kenton's {{difficulties}} in setting her husband right were indefinitely {{heightened by the}} suspicion that the most unsuspicious of men fell into concerning Breckon. Did Breckon suppose that the matter could be turned off in that way? he stupidly demanded; {{and when he was}} extricated from this error by his wife's representation that Breckon had not changed at all, but had never told Ellen that he wished to speak with him of anything but his returning to his society, Kenton still could not accept the fact. He would have contended that at least the other matter must have been in Breckon's mind; and when he was beaten from this position, and convinced that the meaning they had taken from Ellen's words had never been in any mind but their own, he fell into humiliation so abject that he could hide it only by the hauteur with which he carried himself towards Breckon when they met at dinner. He would scarcely speak to the young man; Ellen did not come to the table; Lottie and Boyne and their friend Mr. Pogis were dining with the Rasmiths, and Mrs. Kenton had to be, as she felt, cringingly kind to Breckon in explaining just the sort of temporary headache that kept her eldest daughter away. He was more than ordinarily sympathetic and polite, but he was manifestly bewildered by Kenton's behavior. He refused an hilarious invitation from Mrs. Rasmith, when he rose from table, to stop and have his coffee with her on {{his way out of the}} saloon. His old adorer explained that she had ordered a small bottle of champagne in honor of its being the night before they were to get into Boulogne, and that he ought to sit down and help her keep the young people straight. Julia, she brokenly syllabled, with the gay beverage bubbling back into her throat, was not the least use; she was worse than any. Julia did not look it, in the demure regard which she bent upon her amusing mother, and Breckon persisted in refusing. He said he thought he might safely leave them to Boyne, and Mrs. Rasmith said into her handkerchief, [...] "Oh yes! Boyne!" [...] and <b>pressed</b> Boyne's <b>sleeve</b> with her knobbed and jewelled fingers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn Metered Dose Inhaler plant of {{pharmaceutical}} industries of Bangladesh, clamp sleeve spare part used in crimping machine collected from foreign countries. The clamp <b>sleeve</b> <b>presses</b> the crimping tong containing aluminium can to crimp {{the body with}} head. Due to the continuous action of the clamp sleeve to the crimping tong the inner surface of the clamp sleeve get corroded. The clamp sleeve is replaced when crimping appearance fails to meet compliance. In this Research an experimental work relating to improve the mechanical properties of locally available low carbon steel material by heat treatment process {{have been carried out}} to replace the spare parts of clamp sleeve which is collected from foreign countries. The mechanical properties have been studied on before and after heat treatment. After heat treatment, it is found that hardness, impact and compressive strength of heat treated specimen has been developed drastically as compared to that of before heat treatment. Finally, the properties of improved material has been determined and used to the machine functional area to check the performance of the clamp sleeve. After consecutive operation of the machine it can be concluded that the improved clamp sleeve meets the user requirement with compliance of smooth crimping quality and locally available low carbon steel material can be used for the preparation of clamp sleeve spare parts of crimping machine for pharmaceutical industry using the proper heat treatment process which might be helpful to save huge cost and time rather than collected from foreign countries...|$|R
