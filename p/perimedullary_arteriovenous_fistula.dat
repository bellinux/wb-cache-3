40|$|Objective Seventy-two {{pediatric}} spinal vascular malforma-tion {{cases were}} reviewed and {{the characteristics of}} their clinical symptoms, diagnoses, and therapies were analyzed. Materials and methods A thorough overview was compiled examining patient sex, age, location, history, development, treatment, clinical, and anatomical results. Results Spinal cord arteriovenous malformation {{was the most common}} (44. 4 %) subtype to be seen in these pediatric patients, while subdural <b>perimedullary</b> <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> (23. 6 %) was the second, followed by Cobb’s syndrome (13. 9 %) and intramedullary cavernous angioma (5. 6 %). No spinal dual arteriovenous fistulae were found in infants. The highest incidence was seen during the infant and adolescent periods. Sixty-nine cases were treated by surgeries, embo-lizations, or a combination of both, and 71. 5 % of them had improved. Conclusions Early diagnosis and treatment are required.

40|$|SUMMARY: PMAVFs {{are rare}} {{entities}} that are formed by a direct communication between an artery that feeds {{the spinal cord}} and a vein. The goal of treatment is to occlude the shunt; this is done endovascularly either from an arterial or a venous approach. When these approaches are not possible, direct percutaneous puncture of the draining veins may be attempted to embolize the arteriovenous shunt directly.

40|$|Summary: Embolization of type I perimedullary spinal ar-teriovenous fistulas (AVFs) can be difficult, {{because of}} {{tortuosity}} {{and the small}} diameter of the feeder and distal location of the fistula site. The 1. 5 F flow-directed catheter {{in conjunction with a}} hydrophilic guidewire has been used in fistula embolization with cyanoacrylate glue for spinal vascular malformations at our institution. This combina-tion has improved our success rate in achieving superse-lective catheterization of the fistula. Thus, 4 of 5 patients with type I perimedullary AVFs could be cured with this technique. Like type II and type III perimedullary AVFs, the endovascular approach may also be the first line of treatment in type I perimedullary spinal AVF. <b>Perimedullary</b> <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulas</b> (AVFs) of the spinal cord are rare vascular malformations.

40|$|Background <b>Perimedullary</b> <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulas</b> (PMAVFs) {{are rare}} spinal lesions {{and even more}} {{uncommon}} in children. Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to document rare occurrences of this type of arteriovenous malformation in six children treated at our institution. Methods The clinical data, radiological findings, and treatment in six cases of PMAVFs were reviewed. Six patients with PMAVFs were managed at our institution over a 5 -year period. The patients (four girls and two boys), ranging in age from 6 to 15 years, presented with initially fluctuating, and eventually permanent and progressive, sudden-onset paraparesis, sensory disturbances, and sphincter dysfunction. The duration of symptoms before diagnosis ranged from 1 week to 13 years. Results All the patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging and spinal selective angiography, which demonstrated the characteristic imaging of an <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula.</b> Embolization of the <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> was initially attempted in three patients with successful occlusion of the fistula in two. For the remaining cases, open surgery was performed, with complete occlusion of the fistula. There was no morbidity, regardless of the treatment performed. All the patients experienced neurological improvement after treatment. Conclusions No specific clinical or radiological characteristic of PMAVFs in the pediatric population was observed when our series was compared with a general series. Early diagnosis and timing of the therapeutic intervention seemed to avoid the development of irreversible ischemic myeloradiculopathy and prevented hemorrhage. Treatment for PMAVFs is difficult to standardize because these are extremely rare lesions with different angioarchitecture configurations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The <b>perimedullary</b> <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulas</b> {{are located}} on the pial surface and are usually {{supplied}} by spinal medullary arteries, that is, either by the anterior or posterior spinal arteries, with no intervening nidus between the feeder arteries and the venous drainage. The clinical findings are, more commonly, caused by progressive radiculomedullary ischemic processes secondary to steal vascular mechanism. As the vascular supply to the spinal cord and to the <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulas</b> (AVF) is not shared with one another, the vascular steal phenomenon cannot be implicated in this case`s physiopathology. Most probably, the mass effect caused by the giant venous dilatation was the pathophysiological mechanism involved in this lesion Case report The authors describe {{the case of a}} 6 -year-old girl with an intradural ventral <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula,</b> with a giant venous dilatation, fed directly by L 2 and L 3 radiculomedullary arteries at the conus medullaris. There was no arterial supply to the fistula from the anterior or posterior spinal arteries. Selective spinal angiography showed an <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> supplied directly by two radiculomedullary arteries, with a large draining vein caudally. Interposing the arterial and venous vessels was a giant venous aneurysmal dilatation located ventral to the conus medullaris and extending from L 3 to T 6. The patient was successfully treated by a surgical approach through a laminotomy from L 3 to T 11. Conclusion The type IV-C spinal <b>arteriovenous</b> malformations or <b>perimedullary</b> AVFs are rare lesions predominately described at the conus medullaris with various types of angio-architecture and controversial treatment...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} magnetic resonance (MR) angiography {{in the assessment of}} spinal vascular malformation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with spinal vascular malformations (30 dural <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulas,</b> two <b>perimedullary</b> <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulas,</b> and two intramedullary arteriovenous malformations) underwent MR angiography and MR imaging before and after endovascular or surgical treatment. RESULTS: MR angiography showed residual flow in perimedullary vessels in seven patients with dural fistula after embolization with liquid adhesive. In all seven, treatment failure was confirmed with arteriography. Long-lasting disappearance of flow in perimedullary vessels was demonstrated at MR angiography in 22 patients with dural fistula. MR imaging demonstrated normalization of spinal cord volume in 16 of 22 patients and signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images in three patients. Disappearance of cord enhancement was observed in five of 21 patients and of perimedullary enhanced vessels in six of 13 patients. In one additional patient with dural fistula treated with embolization, early posttreatment MR angiography showed disappearance of flow in perimedullary vessels, which reappeared at follow-up and was consistent with reopening of a small residual fistula. Posttreatment MR angiography demonstrated transient reduction of flow in the nidus in two patients with intramedullary malformations treated with embolization. Permanent disappearance of flow in the perimedullary vessel was seen after endovascular treatment in two patients with perimedullary fistula. CONCLUSION: MR angiography is more sensitive than MR imaging in depicting residual or recurrent flow in peri- or intramedullary vessels, which indicates patency of the vascular malformation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: <b>Perimedullary</b> <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulas</b> (PMAVF) are {{exceptional}} spinal vascular malformations {{and their}} best therapeutic management remains controversial. Here the authors present {{their experience with}} PMAVF to characterize the clinical, neuroimaging and treatment data of patients operated on PMAVF and to analyse both incidence of complications and resurgery in the microsurgical therapy of PMAVF. Method: Fifteen patients (13 men, 2 women, mean age 51 years) with PMAVF identified by selective spinal angiography were microsurgically treated at our institution between 1992 and 2006. The presenting symptoms (duration 3 months to 5 years) were consistent with progressive myelopathy (13) or included isolated pain syndrome (2). Lumbar PMAVF location (6) was predominant followed by the sacral (5) and thoracic (4) site including 6 PMAVF of the filum terminale and 2 PMAVF associated with a glomerular AVM and dural <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula,</b> respectively. Microsurgical PMAVF obliteration and postoperative angiography were routinely performed. All patients were available for follow-up evaluation within 6 months postoperatively. Results: Surgery with complete (12) or almost complete (3) PMAVF occlusion resulted in neurological improvement (10) or stabilization (1), 4 patients deteriorated postoperatively. Whereas no complications occured, a second operation because of residual or recanalized PMAVF was indicated in one case each. Two associated dual spinal vascular malformations could be observed and subsequently obliterated. Conclusions: Microsurgical occlusion of PMAVF {{appears to be a}} secure and adequate therapeutic option that prevents progressive neurological deterioration and results in good outcome in the majority of patients. Complications associated with surgery, recurrences and reoperations are infrequent. Therefore, in the authors experience microsurgery is the preferred therapy to treat PMAVF. Despite the rarity of PMAVF the possibility of the coincidence of associated second vascular malformations should be considered...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUNDAND PURPOSE: The {{diagnosis}} of spinal vascular malformations may be challenging on conventional MR imaging because neither {{the location of}} the signal abnormality in the spinal cord nor the level of the abnormal flow voids correlates with the level of the fistula. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of the utility of using a time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics sequence in the diagnosis, characterization, and localization of spinal vascular malformations, comparing it with the criterion standard of spinal DSA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five consecutive patients with a suspected {{diagnosis of}} spinal vascular malformation underwent time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics followed by spinal DSA. All scans were performed on a 1. 5 T scanner by using a standard 8 -channel spine coil and were reported by a neuroradiologist before the DSA was performed. RESULTS: Forty-seven lesions were confirmed on time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics and classified as spinal dural <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulas</b> (n 33, with 1 patient having a type Ib <b>fistula),</b> <b>perimedullary</b> spinal cord <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulas</b> (n 10), and intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (n 3). One patient had an extradural spinal vascular malformation. Time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics identified {{the location of the}} arterial feeder to within 1 vertebral level in 27 / 33 patients (81. 8 %) with spinal dural <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulas</b> and correctly predicted the side in 22 / 33 (66. 6 %) patients. <b>Perimedullary</b> spinal cord <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulas</b> were erroneously considered to represent spinal dural <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulas</b> before spinal DSA. The anatomy of the arterial supply to intramedullary arteriovenous malformations was also poorly characterized on time-resolved contrast-enhanced MR angiography...|$|R
40|$|Spinal {{arteriovenous}} malformations (AVM) {{have been}} devided into dural (Type I), intramedullary glomus (Type II), juvenile (Type III), and <b>perimedullary</b> direct <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulae</b> (Type IV). AVMs are {{usually associated with}} subacute myelopathy {{in what has been}} known as Foix-Alajouanine syndrome. We presented two patients with two intradural spinal arteriovenous malformations associated in what we call Foix-Alajouanine syndrome. The both patient developed acute back pain and paresthesias, followed by paraplegia and incontinence. The clinical status of one patient has been improved after particle embolization for a 17 years when he deteriorated up to paraplegia after spinal angiography for follow up. Clinical status in another patient deteriorated, because particle emoblisation cannot be performed due to very descrete presentation of the feeding artery. Extensive neuroradiological examination in both patients revealed coexistence of numerous associated developmental anomalies in both patients. We conclude that arteriovenous malformations occasionally are associated with other vascular and nonvascular developmental anomalies elsewhere in the body. These findings rise attention about keep in mind the suspicion of mutual etiopathogenesis and congenital origin of these anomalies. Early timing of the diagnostic and therapeutic interventiosn are stressed to prevent or delay irreversible ishaemic myellopathy or haemorrhage.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Iatrogenic <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> is a {{vascular}} {{condition that}} may result from coronary angiography. Many case reports have described <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> occurrence after coronary angiography using the transfemoral access route, but rarely as a complication of using the transradial approach. We report a rare case of a patient with <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> following transradial artery coronary angiography. Case presentation A 62 -year-old Caucasian man underwent emergent coronary angiography using the right radial artery approach. One month after angiography, he discovered a turbulent sound near the access site. A right radial <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> was found upon duplex ultrasound investigation. The patient was treated conservatively. At 1 -year follow-up, the <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> was unchanged and the patient remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic. Conclusion Iatrogenic <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> is a rare vascular complication of transradial artery coronary angiography. The natural history of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> is benign and is thought to resolve spontaneously; therefore, a conservative approach, as opposed to surgical ligation, is recommended as the first-line treatment. </p...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveIntractable {{cyanosis}} after partial {{or complete}} cavopulmonary connection may rarely {{be managed by}} creating a systemic <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula.</b> We investigated the long-term performance of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulae.</b> MethodsAll 21 patients who received an <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> at The Hospital for Sick Children since the 1950 s were investigated using parametric competing risk techniques. Primary <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> indication was (1) suboptimal pulmonary blood flow (N = 15) or (2) pulmonary shunting via pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (N = 6). <b>Arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> longevity was determined by time to “occlusion” (absence of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> flow via surgical ligation or spontaneous occlusion). ResultsAll 21 patients had previously undergone second-stage palliation (Glenn shunt = 13; bidirectional shunt = 9). Five patients had undergone Fontan completion. Death {{in the presence of}} a functioning <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> occurred in 5 patients. Patients with bidirectional shunts had a significantly higher risk of death with a functioning <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> in situ (P =. 04). High hemoglobin concentrations were associated with best outcome, and levels less than 170 g/L were associated with a high risk of death despite a functioning <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> (P <. 01). <b>Arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> occlusion occurred in 10 patients. Earlier occlusion was associated with previous Fontan completion (P =. 02) and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (P =. 03). Surgical ligation during cardiac transplantation was the cause of occlusion in 7 patients. In these 7 patients, the <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> functioned for a median of 4. 8 years. After transplantation, survival was 67 % ± 19 % at 5 years. Overall survival was 73 % ± 10 % 15 years after receiving an <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> (longest survival, 27. 3 years). ConclusionIn patients with adequate hematocrit, <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> offers an effective bridge to transplantation when a high-risk Fontan procedure is deferred.

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} <b>Arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulas</b> {{often fail to}} mature, and nonmaturation {{has been attributed to}} postoperative stenosis caused by aggressive neointimal hyperplasia.

Design, setting, participants, & measurements This work explored the relationship between preexisting venous intimal hyperplasia, postoperative <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> stenosis, and clinical <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> outcomes in 145 patients. Venous specimens obtained during <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> creation were quantified for maximal intimal thickness (median thickness= 22. 3 mm). Postoperative ultrasounds at 4 – 6 weeks were evaluated for arterio-venous <b>fistula</b> stenosis. <b>Arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> maturation within 6 months of creation was determined clinically. Results Postoperative <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> stenosis was equally frequent in patients with preexisting venous intimal hyperplasia (thickness. 22. 3 mm) and patients without hyperplasia (46 % versus 53 %; P= 0. 49).

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: The {{success of}} home {{parenteral}} nutrition (HPN) programs is compromised by complications of central venous catheters (CVCs), such as occlusions and bloodstream infections. We performed {{a retrospective analysis}} of complication rates of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulae</b> versus CVCs in patients on long-term HPN. METHODS: Data were collected from 127 consecutive patients who received HPN between January 2000 and October 2006, comprising 344 access years of CVCs and 194 access years of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulae.</b> We evaluated access-related bloodstream infection and occlusion incidence rates (number of complications per access year) using Poisson-normal regression analysis. Complication incidence rate ratios were calculated by dividing complication incidence rates of CVCs by those of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulae,</b> adjusting for HPN frequency, medication use, infusion fluid composition, and underlying diseases. RESULTS: Bloodstream infection incidence rates were 0. 03 /year for <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulae,</b> 1. 37 /year for long-term CVCs (Port-a-Caths and tunneled catheters), and 3. 12 /year for short-term CVCs (nontunneled catheters). Occlusion incidence rates were 0. 60 /year for <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulae,</b> 0. 35 /year for long-term CVCs, and 0. 93 /year for shortterm CVCs. Adjusted incidence rate ratios of long-term CVCs over <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulae</b> were 47 (95 % confidence interval, 19 - 117) for bloodstream infections and 0. 53 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 31 - 0. 89) for occlusions.

40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{in order to determine the}} stress level and stress management level in patients with <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> operations made. Methods: The study was prospective and descriptive. The sample consisted of 103 hemodialysis patients who met the inclusion criteria for the study. Research Data was collected using the Patient Identification Form, Perceived Stress Scale, and Healthy Lifestyle Behaviours Scale (Stress Management Subscale). Results: 47. 6 % of the patients had an <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> operations made and 45. 6 % of the patients had at least one complication. The most common complications were thrombosis, hemorrhage and stenosis, respectively. The perceived stress level in patients that developed <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> complications was found to be higher but the levels of stress management were lower. Patients who had an <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> operations made once had higher levels of stress management and patients who had an <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> operations made two times had a higher perceived level of stress. Discussion: Development of complications due to <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> had an effect on stress level and management in patients, and the number of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> operation had a partial effect on stress level and management in patients, even though it was not statistically significant.

40|$|Abstract- Patients with end stage {{renal disease}} {{need a good}} {{vascular}} access for hemodialysis. <b>Arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> is the method of choice for vascular access in these patients. However, failure of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> due to thrombosis is a major problem. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of the heparin on the patency of the <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula.</b> This prospective interventional case control study was performed from November 2003 through May 2005 in vascular surgery ward in Imam Reza Hospital. All the patients who underwent a surgery in order to perform an <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> in cubital or snuff box areas for the dialysis means were enrolled. They were randomly divided into two groups. The case group (n = 96) received intraoperative heparin whereas the controls (n = 102) did not. Early observation of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> (immediately after surgery) showed patency in 89 % of heparin group and in 87 % of the control group. The patency rate 2 weeks after the surgery was 85 % in heparin group versus 74 % in the control group, resulting in a statistically significant difference (P value = 0. 046). According to higher patency rate of <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> in 2 weeks following surgery in case group, we recommend intraoperative use of heparin in <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula</b> operations...|$|R

Most of the previously reported patients with renal <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistulae</b> were treated by nephrectomy. But, several patients were treated by partial nephrectomy, ligation of the feeding vessels, fistulectomy and endofistulorrhaphy. We report herein three cases of congenital renal <b>arteriovenous</b> <b>fistula.</b> Two cases were successfully treated by partial nephrectomy and one case did not undergo any operations because of the poor renal function.
