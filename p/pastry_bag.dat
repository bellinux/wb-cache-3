25|$|The choux pastry paste is piped {{through a}} <b>pastry</b> <b>bag</b> or dropped {{with a pair}} of spoons into small balls and baked to form largely hollow puffs. After cooling, the baked profiteroles are {{injected}} with filling using a <b>pastry</b> <b>bag</b> and narrow piping tip, or by slicing off the top, filling them, and reassembling. For sweet profiteroles, additional glazes or decorations may then be added.|$|E

50|$|Aside from icing, <b>pastry</b> <b>bags</b> are {{commonly}} used to shape meringue and whipped cream, and to fill doughnuts with jelly or custard. They are used to form cream puffs, éclairs, and ladyfingers. When presentation is especially important, fluted tips {{can be used to}} shape savory foods such as filling for deviled eggs, whipped butter, and mashed potatoes (especially for Pommes duchesse).|$|R
5000|$|On April 4, 1998, Pietronigro {{flew from}} NASA's Johnson Space Center, aboard a KC135 turbojet, to create ‘drift {{painting}}s’ as the artist's body floated within the 3-D kinetic painting space facilitated by parabolic flight and microgravity. [...] He appropriated modernist painting conventions using similar techniques employed in abstract expressionism {{but with the}} intention of having different outcomes within a postmodern situation. Pietronigro painted by squeezing rainbow colored acrylic paints from <b>pastry</b> <b>bags</b> into the space surrounding his body. A 75 in by 48 in by 52 in plastic bag was tethered to the interior of the jet using bungee cords and Velcro. This [...] "creativity chamber", as he called it, was to contain the floating paint while allowing for free-float body movement within the space. Before flight Pietronigro filled 10", 14" [...] and 18" [...] <b>pastry</b> <b>bags</b> with acrylic gel medium, at the viscosity of toothpaste, and then he used these tools to project the paint into the space surrounding his body.|$|R
50|$|The first {{extruder}} {{was designed}} to manufacture sausages in the 1870s. Packaged dry pasta and breakfast cereals have been produced via extrusion since the 1930s, and the method was applied to pet food production in the 1950s. It has also been incorporated into kitchen appliances, such as meat grinders, herb grinders, coffee grinders, and some types of pasta makers. A similar functional process occurs when using <b>pastry</b> <b>bags.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Pastry</b> <b>bag</b> {{users who}} do not have a dishwashing machine may prefer to use {{disposable}} bags, and thus avoid hand-washing messy bags. Disposable bags are ready-made in inexpensive plastic. A plastic food storage bag is also commonly used as a <b>pastry</b> <b>bag.</b> For small quantities and fine piping, a <b>pastry</b> <b>bag</b> can be made by rolling cooking parchment or wax paper into a cone, filling it, folding the wide end several times to close it, and then cutting the tip into whatever shape is desired. This is especially useful for small quantities of melted chocolate, since a very small hole can be cut and the bag can be discarded when it cools and becomes clogged.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Pastry</b> <b>bag</b> or piping bag: An often {{cone-shaped}} {{bag that}} is used to make an even stream of dough, frosting, or flavored substance to form a structure, decorate a baked item, or fill a pastry with a custard, cream, jelly, or other filling.|$|E
50|$|Icing can {{be formed}} into shapes such as flowers and leaves using a <b>pastry</b> <b>bag.</b> Such decorations are commonplace on {{birthday}} and wedding cakes. Chef's color dye (food coloring) is commonly added to icing mixtures {{to achieve the}} desired color. Sprinkles, coloring mist, edible ink designs, or other decorations are often used on top of icing.|$|E
50|$|A <b>pastry</b> <b>bag</b> (or piping {{bag in the}} Commonwealth) is {{an often}} cone- or triangular-shaped, {{hand-held}} bag made from cloth, paper, or plastic {{that is used to}} pipe semi-solid foods by pressing them through a narrow opening at one end, for many purposes including cake decoration. It is filled through a wider opening at the opposite end, rolled or twisted closed, and then squeezed to extrude its contents.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, Rich's {{introduced}} Freeze-Flo, {{a process}} that allows foods to remain soft while frozen. The company introduced another product, On Top, a non-dairy dessert topping, in 1986, which was notable for its packaging - a <b>pastry</b> <b>bag</b> with its own tip. Rich's also expanded its product line through the acquisition of Casa Di Bertacchi, a specialty meat and frozen pasta producer, in 1982, and Byron's, a barbecue and meat producer, in 1986.|$|E
50|$|Schmidt used a {{technique}} called tube-lining. In this a thick slip is applied via a <b>pastry</b> <b>bag.</b> He then constructed plaster of Paris molds on which the designs were worked out and allowed to dry. These were gently removed from the molds and attached to {{the main body of}} the ware with fresh slip. After that further painted decoration, glazing and firing took place. In other cases, decoration was carved into the wet ceramic bodies.|$|E
5000|$|Like other sponge cakes, ladyfingers {{traditionally}} {{contain no}} chemical leavening agent, {{and rely on}} air incorporated into the eggs for their [...] "sponge" [...] texture. However, some brands contain ammonium bicarbonate. The egg whites and egg yolks mixed with sugar are typically beaten separately and folded together with flour. They contain more flour than the average sponge cake. The mixture is piped through a <b>pastry</b> <b>bag</b> in short lines onto sheets, giving the biscuits their notable shape.|$|E
50|$|Cupcakes may be {{topped with}} {{frosting}} or other cake decorations. They may {{be filled with}} frosting, fruit, or pastry cream. For bakers making {{a small number of}} filled cupcakes, this is usually accomplished by using a spoon or knife to scoop a small hole {{in the top of the}} cupcake. Another method is to just insert the <b>pastry</b> <b>bag</b> in the middle of the cupcake. In commercial bakeries, the filling may be injected using a syringe. Elaborately decorated cupcakes may be made for special occasions.|$|E
50|$|The yeast dough {{contains}} {{a good deal}} of eggs, milk and butter. For the classical Pfannkuchen made in Berlin the dough gets baled, deep-fried in lard, whereby the distinctive bright bulge occurs, and then filled with jam. The filling is related to the topping: for plum-butter, powdered sugar; for raspberry, strawberry and cherry jam, sugar; for all other fillings, sugar icing, sometimes flavoured with rum. Today the filling usually is injected with a large syringe or <b>pastry</b> <b>bag</b> after the dough is fried in one piece.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Tina and Louise {{discover}} that Moolissa's feces resembles a smiley face emoticon. This leads Tina {{to believe that}} Moolissa is sending messages to her through his feces. Louise then decides to prank Tina by shaping Moolissa's feces into emoticon symbols with a <b>pastry</b> <b>bag</b> to lead Tina into thinking that he is still sending messages to her. One night, however, Louise decides to shape the feces {{into the shape of}} an [...] "angry face" [...] emoticon. Tina becomes upset after reading this and decides it is time for her and Moolissa to move on.|$|E
5000|$|Spritzgebäck {{is a type}} of German and Alsatian-Mosellan Christmas biscuit or Christmas cookie made of flour, butter, {{sugar and}} eggs. When made correctly, the cookies are crisp, fragile, {{somewhat}} dry, and buttery. The German verb spritzen means to squirt in English. As the name implies, these cookies are made by extruding, or [...] "squirting," [...] the dough with a press fitted with patterned holes (a cookie press) or with a cake decorator, or <b>pastry</b> <b>bag,</b> to which a variety of nozzles may be fitted. In the United States, the name Spritzgebäck is often shortened to spritz becoming known as the spritz cookie.|$|E
50|$|An éclair is an oblong pastry {{made with}} choux dough {{filled with a}} cream and topped with icing. The dough, {{which is the same}} as that used for profiterole, is {{typically}} piped into an oblong shape with a <b>pastry</b> <b>bag</b> and baked until it is crisp and hollow inside. Once cool, the pastry is then filled with a vanilla-, coffee- or chocolate-flavoured custard (crème pâtissière), or with whipped cream, or chiboust cream; and then iced with fondant icing. Other fillings include pistachio- and rum-flavoured custard, fruit-flavoured fillings, or chestnut purée. The icing is sometimes caramel, in which case the dessert may be called a bâton de Jacob.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, canapés {{are built}} on stale bread (although other foods {{may be used as}} a base), cut in thin slices and then shaped with a cutter or knife. Shapes might include circles, rings, squares, strips or triangles. These pieces of bread are then {{prepared}} by deep frying, sautéing, or toasting. The foods are sometimes highly processed and decoratively applied (e.g., piped) to the base with a <b>pastry</b> <b>bag.</b> Decorative garnishes are then applied. The canapés are usually served on a canapé salver and eaten from small canapé plates. The technical composition of a canapé consists of a base (e.g., the bread or pancake), a spread, a main item, and a garnish. The spread is traditionally either a compound butter or a flavored cream cheese. Common garnishes can range from finely chopped vegetables, scallions, and herbs to caviar or truffle oil.|$|E
5000|$|Tips come in sets of {{interchangeable}} pieces; expensive tips can {{be purchased}} one at a time. They may be chrome-plated or stainless steel, or plastic. Each tip is cone-shaped, with a base too large to fit through the small opening in the bag; {{they are to be}} inserted through the larger opening before food is spooned in. Tips can be used with pairs of adapter rings: an inner ring is dropped inside the bag and pushed part way out the hole, a tip is slipped over the ring, then an outer ring is slipped over the tip and screwed onto the inner ring. This permits the tip to be changed without emptying the bag. Some inexpensive sets are of disposable plastic film with a drop-in ring and screw-on plastic tips (see image above). Many foods (including frosting and pressurized [...] "spray can" [...] whipped cream) {{can be purchased}} in disposable packaging designed to serve the function of a <b>pastry</b> <b>bag.</b>|$|E
