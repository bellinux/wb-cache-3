To our knowledge {{this is the first}} quantitative estimation of impacts of reactive and preventive adaptation strategies within one modelling framework at a regional scale. We follow a rather pragmatic approach and based on a state-of-the-art forest fire module linked with the Community Land Model (CLM) develop a standalone fire model (SFM). With SFM, we explore fuel removal through <b>prescribed</b> <b>burnings</b> and improved fire suppression as adaptation options, selected in consultation with stakeholders. We quantify impacts of climate change on forest fires informed by three climate models reflecting the SRES A 2 scenario. The quantitative results we obtained show satisfying performance of SFM model in terms of agreement of the modelled burned areas in Europe for selected test countries with observed data coming from two different sources (European Forest Fire Information System and Global Fires Emissions Database). We highlight unequal modelling accuracy across the selected test countries that should be taken into account for further interpretation. The projections of climate change impact (without adaptation) and assessment of <b>prescribed</b> <b>burnings</b> efficiency (under present climate) derived as by-products for comparison purposes are in line with existing literature.

AMS loadings were dominated by OA (64 %), followed by, sulfate (17 %), ammonium (14 %) and nitrates (5 %). Source apportionment was applied on the AMS OA mass spectra via the multilinear engine solver (ME- 2) implementation within the recently developed Source Finder (SoFi) interface. Six factors were extracted including hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), cooking-related OA (COA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), low-volatility oxygenated OA (LV-OOA), semivolatile oxygenated OA (SV-OOA), and nitrogen-enriched OA (NOA).

Since many forests are under management of the government that is in the region, the forest are not truly functioning how the ecosystem was naturally developed, and how it is meant to be. An example is the pine flatwoods in Florida. To be able to maintain that ecosystem frequent burnings of the forest needs to happen.

This paper reviews {{what is known about}} the impacts of <b>prescribed</b> moorland vegetation <b>burning</b> on water colour. Relevant research has taken place at three scales: laboratory experiments on peat cores, plot scale sampling of soil waters and catchment scale sampling of stream waters. While laboratory studies suggest burning increases colour production, the evidence from catchment and plot studies is contradictory. Plot studies suggest colour production may decrease or remain unchanged following burning although there is evidence for some transient changes. Catchment studies suggest <b>prescribed</b> moorland <b>burning</b> causes stream water colour to increase, although in most cases the evidence is not clear cut since most studies could not clearly disentangle the effects of burning from those of vegetation cover. The differences in findings between plot and catchment studies may be explained by: i) the short-term nature of some studies which do not measure long-term response and recovery times to burning; ii) the lack of colour measurements from shallow soil depths which contribute more to streamflow than soil water from deeper in the peat; and iii) the possibility of hydrological interactions occurring between different experimental plots at some sites. Additionally, the increase in recent patch burning in some catchments that has been statistically attributed by some authors to increases in stream water colour cannot be reconciled with theoretical calculations. When dilution with waters derived {{from other parts of the}} catchment are taken into account, large values of colour have to be theoretically derived from those recently burnt areas that occupy a small proportion of the catchment area in order to balance the change in stream water colour observed in recent years. Therefore, much further process-based work is required to properly investigate whether <b>prescribed</b> vegetation <b>burning</b> is a direct driver of enhanced colour and DOC in upland streams, rivers and lakes...|$|R

From the gas phase Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements, an average modified combustion efficiency of 0. 99 was obtained, suggesting a very strong predominance of flaming combustion. Gaseous compounds whose emissions are promoted in fresh plumes and during the flaming burning phase, such as CO 2, acetylene and propene, produced emission factors higher than those proposed for savannah and tropical forest fires. Emission factors of species that are favoured by the smouldering phase (e. g. CO and CH 4) were below the values {{reported in the literature}} for biomass burning in other ecosystems. The chemical composition of fine (PM 2. 5) and coarse (PM 2. 5 e 10) particles was achieved using ion chromatography (water-soluble ions), instrumental neutron activation analysis (trace elements) and a thermaleoptical transmission technique (organic carbon and elemental carbon).

40|$|In fire {{dependent}} forested ecosystems, fire {{managers are}} greatly interested {{in predicting the}} consequences of their management-oriented <b>prescribed</b> <b>burnings</b> on post-fire tree mortality. While fire intensity is believed to be a strong predictor of tree mortality, fire behavior itself largely depends on fuel characteristics, including both their structure and spatial distribution. We examined the type and distribution of fuels, their effects on fire behavior, and the effects of fire on tree mortality in slash pine forests in the Florida Keys. We conducted a burning experiment in six blocks, and burned eleven plots, three in winter and eight in summer, over a four-year period from 1998 to 2001. Post-fire slash pine mortality was investigated annually for one, two or three years in seven burn plots, three winter burn and four summer burn plots. We used linear regression to model the effects of fuel types on fire severity, and logistic regression to model the effects of burn season, fire severity and tree dimensions on tree mortality. Fire severity increased with surface fuel loads, but was negatively related to the quantity of hardwood shrub fuels. Tree mortality was significantly higher in summer burn than in winter burn plots, and was strongly related to tree size and crown scorch percent. This study suggests that pine tree mortality can be minimized by burning in winter. However, in pine forests where the burning objective is to suppress the growth of hardwoods, winter burning involves a trade-off, in that hardwood shrub fuel consumption is reduced...|$|R
40|$|<b>Prescribed</b> {{rangeland}} <b>burning</b> in April is {{a long-standing}} {{practice in the}} Flint Hills region of eastern Kansas to maintain the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. The smoke plumes originating from these fires increases ambient PM 2. 5 concentrations and potentially contributes to ozone (O 3) exceedances in downwind communities. Source apportionment research using Unmix modeling has been utilized to estimate contributions of Kansas rangeland burning to ambient PM 2. 5 concentrations. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the potential correlations between O 3 and various sources of PM 2. 5 that are derived from receptor modeling, and then to specifically estimate contributions of Kansas rangeland burning to ambient O 3 concentrations through regression analysis. Various daily meteorological data were used as predictor variables. Multiple regression models were developed for the eight-hour daily maximum O 3 as well as the daily contributions of the five PM 2. 5 source categories that were derived from receptor modeling. Cross correlation was analyzed among residuals of the meteorological regression models for O 3 and the daily contributions of the five PM 2. 5 source categories in order to identify the potential hidden correlation between O 3 and PM 2. 5. The model including effects of meteorological variables and episodic contributions from fire and industrial emissions can explain up to 78 % of O 3 variability. For non-rainy days in April, the daily average contribution from <b>prescribed</b> rangeland <b>burning</b> to O 3 was 1. 8 ppb. On 3 % of the days in April, <b>prescribed</b> rangeland <b>burning</b> contributed over 12. 7 ppb to O 3; and on 7 % of the days in April, burning contributed more than 7. 2 ppb to O 3. When the intensive burning activities occur in days with high O 3 background due to high solar radiation or O 3 carryover from the previous day, the contributions from these episodic fire emissions could result in O 3 exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The regression models developed in this study demonstrated that the most valuable predictors for O 3 in the Flint Hills region include the O 3 level on the previous day, total solar radiation, difference between daily maximum and minimum air temperature, and levels of episodic fire and industrial emissions. The long term goal is to establish an online O 3 forecasting tool that can assist regulators and land managers in smoke management during the burning season so that the intensive burning activities can be planned to avoid forecasted high O 3 days and thus prevent O 3 exceedance...|$|R

However, large areas are now subject to <b>prescribed</b> vegetation <b>burning</b> despite policy guidance that recommends a strong presumption against burning deep blanket peat. Wildfires occur sporadically but are forecast to increase in frequency in the future. This paper provides a synthesis of current knowledge about how UK peatland-dominated river catchments respond to fires caused by <b>prescribed</b> vegetation <b>burning</b> and uncontrolled wildfire. We provide insight into the effects of fire on the hydrology, biogeochemistry, and biota of peatland river ecosystems, and the peatland-soil-driven controls on these effects at the catchment-scale. Burning increases the depth to water table and water-table variability, although some small-scale studies indicate shallower water table in some places. More work is needed on fire effects on peatland river flow, but recent results suggest a complex response with smaller flow peaks for burned systems associated with most rainfall events, but enhanced peaks compared to unburned systems for the top quintile of rainfall events with the largest total rain. Evidence from biogeochemical studies suggests that fire leads to increased dissolved organic C concentrations in rivers. River biota responses primarily include significant reductions in the density of grazing mayflies but increases among detritivores including Chironomidae and Baetis mayflies. We provide a conceptual synthesis that links the main responses of terrestrial and aquatic systems to fire, and we summarize some major research gaps that should be prioritized to inform future policy around peatland management...|$|R

In the present work we’ll present a preliminary analysis concerning the assessment of the consequences given by the implementation of prescribed fire measures to control the amount of fuel mass in soil recovery, in particular in terms of its water retention capacity, its organic matter content, pH and content of iron.
