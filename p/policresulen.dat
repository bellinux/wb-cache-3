50|$|The {{chain of}} <b>Policresulen</b> is {{negatively}} charged, making it acidic. Its pKa {{is less than}} 0, yet it is considered a weak acid. The mechanism of action is that normal cells are negatively charged, therefore repelling each other. However, wounded and damaged cells are positively charged, causing the <b>Policresulen</b> to be attracted. <b>Policresulen</b> works by making a slight chemical burn on the wounded area, which kills the bacteria and makes the area antiseptic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Policresulen</b> is {{a topical}} haemostatic and antiseptic. It is {{indicated}} for common anal disorders, such as hemorrhoids, and for gynecological infections. In some countries it is marketed under the trade name Albothyl or Polilen (Taiwan) or Faktu (combination with Cinchocaine).|$|E
50|$|<b>Policresulen</b> {{is often}} used for {{gynecological}} infections. While it has some controversies, it {{is also used to}} treat canker sore in some countries. It is known to have an immense pain after the application on canker sore, it is considered as a very effective treatment.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} topical <b>policresulen</b> and cinchocaine in the postoperative pain behavior of open hemorrhoidectomy. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, controlled study. The control group received the usual guidelines with oral medications. The topical treatment group received, in addition, {{the application of the}} ointment and was comprised of two subgroups (<b>policresulen</b> + cinchocaine, and placebo). Pain intensity was recorded with the visual analogue scale. RESULTS: 43 patients were operated on: control group - n = 13, one excluded; placebo - n = 15; and <b>policresulen</b> + cinchocaine - n = 15. The mean age was 45. 98 years and 37. 2 % were men. The average pain intensity was 4. 09 (immediate postoperative), 3. 22 (hospital discharge), 5. 73 (day 1), 5. 77 (day 2), 5. 74 (day 3), 5. 65 (day 7), 5. 11 (day 10), 2. 75 (day 15) and 7. 70 (first bowel movement), with no difference between groups in all periods. CONCLUSION: This study showed no reduction in pain after hemorrhoidectomy with the use of topical <b>policresulen</b> and cinchocaine...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of induced endometritis on uterine blood flow in cows. Transrectal Doppler sonography was performed on uterine arteries of six cyclic cows before and for 4 days after inducing acute endometritis by intrauterine infusion of 720 mg of <b>policresulen,</b> and for 4 days of the following estrous cycle. Time-averaged maximum velocity (TAMV) increased (p 0. 05) in the next 4 days of the same cycle. TAMV and PI values in the subsequent cycle did not differ (p > 0. 05) from the values measured before infusion and showed no changes (p > 0. 05) within the cycle. Blood flow parameters were not related (p > 0. 05) to plasma concentrations of progesterone and estrogen. All cows showed an acute endometritis determined by histopathological findings of biopsy samples taken 1 day after infusion and fibrotic endometrial alterations detected in the subsequent cycle. No relationships were observed between fibrotic changes of the endometrium and uterine blood flow during either cycle. In conclusion, acute inflammation is accompanied by a rise in uterine blood flow, but fibrotic alterations {{do not seem to be}} related to Doppler sonographic findings...|$|E
