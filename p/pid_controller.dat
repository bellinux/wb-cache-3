25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this <b>PID</b> <b>controller</b> is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer <b>PID</b> <b>controller</b> sets a heater temperature goal for the inner <b>PID</b> <b>controller.</b> The inner <b>PID</b> <b>controller</b> controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{automatic}} tuning technique for multiloop <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> applied to MIMO processes. The process parameters are estimated by employing simple closed-loop experiments (where roughly tuned <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> are in place), namely, by evaluating the response of the system to a sequence of set-point step signals (one for each reference input).

40|$|This thesis aims {{to cover}} {{some aspects of}} {{synthesis}} and design of Proportional- Integral-Derivative (<b>PID)</b> <b>controllers.</b> The topics include computer aided design of discrete time controllers, data-based design of discrete <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> and data- robust design of <b>PID</b> <b>controllers.</b> These topics are of paramount in control systems literature {{where a lot of}} stress is laid upon identification of plant and robust design. The computer aided design of discrete time controllers introduces a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based software. The controllers are: Proportional (P), Proportional-Derivative (PD),Proportional-Integral (PI) and Proportional-Integral- Derivative (<b>PID)</b> <b>controllers.</b> Different performance based design methods with these controllers have been introduced. The user can either explore the performance by interactively choosing controllers one by one from the entire set and visualizing its performance or specify some performance constraints and obtaining the resulting set. In data-based design, the thesis presents a way of designing <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> based on input-output data. Thus, the intermediate step of identification of model from data is removed, saving considerable effort. Moreover, the data required is step response data which is easier to obtain in case of discrete time system than frequency response data. Further, a GUI developed for interactive design is also described. In data-robust design, the problem of uncertainty in data is explored. The design method developed finds the stabilizing set which can robustly stabilize the plant with uncertainty. It has been put forward as an application to interval linear programming. The main results of this research include a new way of designing discrete time <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> directly from the data. The simulations further confirm the results. Robust design of <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> with data uncertainty has also been established. Additionally, as a part of this research, a GUI based software has been developed which is expected to be very beneficial to the designers in manufacturing, aerospace and petrochemical industries. <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> are widely used in the industry. Any progress in this field is well acknowledged both in the industry and the academia alike. This thesis attempts a small step further in this direction...|$|R
25|$|The {{control system}} {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a <b>PID</b> <b>controller</b> with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The <b>PID</b> <b>controller</b> primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>PID</b> <b>controller</b> {{parameters}} (the {{gains of}} the proportional, integral and derivative terms) are chosen incorrectly, the controlled process input can be unstable, i.e., its output diverges, {{with or without}} oscillation, and is limited only by saturation or mechanical breakage. Instability is caused by excess gain, particularly {{in the presence of}} significant lag.|$|E
25|$|For example, in most {{motion control}} systems, {{in order to}} {{accelerate}} a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop <b>PID</b> <b>controller</b> {{is being used to}} control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop feed-forward controller and closed-loop <b>PID</b> <b>controller</b> can provide a more responsive control system.|$|E
25|$|Most modern <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> in {{industry}} are implemented in {{distributed control systems}} (DCS), programmable logic controllers (PLCs), or as a panel-mounted digital controller.

40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} a {{graphical}} technique is introduced for finding all continuous-time and discrete-time {{proportional integral derivative}} (<b>PID)</b> <b>controllers</b> that satisfy an H ∞ sensitivity constraint of an arbitrary order transfer function with time delay. These problems can be solved by finding all achievable <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> that simultaneously stabilize the closed-loop characteristic polynomial and satisfy constraints defined {{by a set of}} related complex polynomials. A key advantage of this procedure is that it only depends on the frequency response of the system. The delta operator is used to describe the controllers, because it not only possesses numerical properties superior to the discrete-time shift operator, but also converges to the continuous-time controller as the sampling period approaches zero. A unified approach allows us to use the same procedure for discrete-time and continuous-time H ∞ sensitivity design of <b>PID</b> <b>controllers.</b> Key-Words:- Sensitivity design, frequency response, delta domain, <b>PID</b> <b>controllers,</b> and time delay...|$|R

This optimal solution for <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> including low pass filtering, is complemented by a simple paper and pen solution {{that can be used to}} obtain nearly optimal solutions. The presented approach is shown to give significantly better results compared to ordinary text book solutions based on frequency domain loop shaping. The paper also includes a discussion on how to best formulate <b>PID</b> <b>controllers</b> for design, and how additional filtering may easily improve high frequency robustness...|$|R
25|$|The {{contribution}} from the integral term {{is proportional to}} both {{the magnitude of the}} error and the duration of the error. The integral in a <b>PID</b> <b>controller</b> is the sum of the instantaneous error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have been corrected previously. The accumulated error is then multiplied by the integral gain (Ki) and added to the controller output.|$|E

25|$|The proportional, integral, and {{differential}} {{terms of}} the two controllers will be very different.
