40|$|AbstractVarious {{negative}} {{external effects}} of urban cargo and passenger transportation in Poland {{are presented in}} this paper. The modal split of transportation in Poland is shown as well as estimated values of CO 2 emissions and examples of specific diseases and problems caused by ever growing transportation. Since the majority of pollution and other external effects are generated in urban areas, use of cargo trams in Polish cities is proposed as a solution. Some of the successful implementation {{of this type of}} transportation in various cities is presented. Warsaw was chosen as a good test site for the implementation of the cargo tram. An analysis of chosen transportation negative external effects in Warsaw was made. This paper <b>presents</b> <b>argues</b> that replacing some of the existing transportation by cargo tram can result in reduced negative external effects. The possibility of integration of cargo trams with urban consolidation centers is also shown...|$|E

Empirical evidence from an ethnographic study about the Argentine crisis of 2001 is <b>presented,</b> <b>arguing</b> that periods of crisis are suggestive opportunities to illuminate the diverse forms of economic agency. Contrary to much of the traditional literature which assumes reason as opposed to passions, the findings illustrate the role of the interplay between the cognitive and the emotional in the orientation of economic action...|$|R
40|$|A {{revision}} of the paradigmatic structure attributed to Psychology is <b>presented,</b> <b>arguing</b> the insufficiency of the dominant conception proposed by Lincoln & Guba (1985). As that conception limits the paradigmatic dimensions to three domains: ontology, epistemology and, methodology; two other are added: ethics and politics. These new dimensions are defined, and discussed from a critical perspective. An ontological proposal based on a conception of the Being and the relation is analysed and illustrated with experiences coming from praxis (action and research producing theory) ...|$|R

The scale outcome includes items concerning {{the success of the}} mini-company in relation to the collaborative marketing of a product or service as well as the impact of participation in the mini-company on academic and work skills, employability and personality development. The model includes a distinction between high and low achievers using a variable that measures the selection of mini-companies for the national fair and thus for the final round of the national competition.|$|R
50|$|Trigg’s most {{important}} book is Congenial Souls. It applies {{the insights of}} critical cultural analysis to a field that {{tends to be more}} conventionally concerned with either literary description of Chaucer’s work or depiction of his life and times. Instead, Trigg's book analyses the critical literature on Geoffrey Chaucer across the six-hundred-year period from his death in 1400 to the <b>present,</b> <b>arguing</b> that this long history of reading and writing about Chaucer is marked by a distinctive social process. Trigg argues that imagined and idealised reading communities formed around Chaucer’s works, driven by the unconscious, collective desire to speak with Chaucer, and to become part of his own intimate circle of friends and other poets.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} three {{monetary policy}} issuesâpolicy independence, choice of targets, and rules versus discretion. According {{to the new}} monetary consensus, the central bank needs policy independence to build credibility, the operating target is the overnight interbank lending rate, and {{the ultimate goal is}} price stability. An alternative view is <b>presented,</b> <b>arguing</b> that an effective central bank cannot be independent as conventionally defined, where effectiveness is indicated by the ability to hit an overnight nominal interest rate target. Discretionary policy and conventional views of central bank ability to achieve traditional goals such as robust growth, low inflation, or high employment are rejected. Thus, the paper returns to Keynes's call for low interest rates and euthanasia of the rentier. central bank independence, Keynes, monetary policy targets, Post Keynesian theory, rules versus discretion,...|$|R

The noted Iranologist Richard Nelson Frye supports ethnic continuity from ancient times to the <b>present,</b> <b>arguing</b> successfully that the term 'Syrian' originating from 'Assyrian' supports continuity, particularly when applied to the Semites in northern Mesopotamia and its surrounds. In a response to John Joseph, Frye writes [...] "I do not understand why Joseph and others ignore the evidence of Armenian, Arab and Persian sources in regard to usage with initial a-, including contemporary practice." [...] Robert Rollinger also uses this line of argumentation to support continuity. Joseph was originally skeptical about the initial a-theory, but has since been forced to accept it following the discovery of the Cinekoy Inscription, while saying it does not affect the veracity of Assyrian continuity claims.|$|R

40|$|Persistently <b>Present</b> <b>argues</b> {{that we need}} to {{more fully}} {{reassess}} our thinking about the relationship(s) between social connectedness and technologically mediated forms of communication (particularly social-mobile technologies). Noting that contemporary social life is marked by connections that are more flexible, accessible, negotiable, and persistent because communication opportunities are nearly constant, I argue that social-mobile technologies are shifting and reconfiguring the ways that students build and maintain their social relationships. Within this environment social-mobile technologies are effectively serving as tools of social extensibility, allowing individuals to expand, enhance, and extend their social presence. As a result, these technologies are altering the when, where, and how (contexts) of contemporary connectedness and interactions. The concept of social extensibility is investigated across four important and interdependent areas that emerged in my data and the related literature: connectivity, virtual spaces, non-spaces, and expressiveness. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{review the}} status of cosmic {{velocity}} analysis as of January 2000, {{with an emphasis on}} two key questions: (1) What is the scale of the largest bulk flows in the universe? and (2) What is the value of beta=Omega_m^{ 0. 6 }/b indicated by cosmic velocities, and what does this tell us about Omega_m itself? These are the most important issues for cosmic flow analysis, and each has been controversial in recent years. I argue that a preponderance of the evidence at <b>present</b> <b>argues</b> against very large scale (> 100 Mpc) bulk flows, and favors beta = 0. 4 - 0. 5, corresponding to a low-density (Omega_m= 0. 2 - 0. 3) universe.

40|$|Short DNA duplexes are {{protected}} when λ DNA is digested with nuclease {{in the presence}} of λ repressor. As the ratio of repressor to operator is increased, six successively larger fragments are recovered, ranging in size from 35 to 100 base pairs, each of which binds repressor. Study of these fragments indicates that, at each of the two λ operators (oL and oR), repressor first binds to a unique site (not necessarily terminal), and that five additional sites are then filled in linear right-ward or left-ward order. The nucleotide sequences and affinities for repressor of oL and oR are not identical, although six fragments of similar size {{are protected}} at each operator. Evidence is <b>presented</b> <b>arguing</b> against the existence of hairpin-like structures in the operator fragments, and, moreover, it is shown that the operator duplex does not unwind when repressor binds to it...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} the evolving pattern of city-regional governance in England. Following {{the demise of}} English regional policy in 2004, city-regions have come to represent the in vogue spatial scale amongst policy elites. Supported by an emerging consensus that economic competitiveness is contingent on 'successful' city-regions, {{the result has been}} a proliferation of actual and proposed policies and institutions designed to operate at a, variously defined, city-regional scale in England. The analysis <b>presented</b> <b>argues</b> that to understand why contemporary state reorganisation results in a multiplication of the scales economic governance and spatial planning we must recognise how the state shapes policies in such a way as to protect its legitimacy for maintain regulatory control and management of the economy. The final section of the paper relates these findings to wider debates on state rescaling and speculates on the future role of transition models in sociospatial theory...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{discusses}} experimental argument assistance tools. In {{contrast with}} automated reasoning tools, {{the objective is}} not to replace reasoning, but to guide the user's production of arguments. Two systems are <b>presented,</b> <b>Argue!</b> and ArguMed based on DefLog. The focus is on defeasible argumentation {{with an eye on}} the law. Argument assistants for defeasible argumentation naturally correspond to a view of the application of law as dialectical theory construction. The experiments provide insights into the design of argument assistants, and show {{the pros and cons of}} different ways of representing argumentative data. The development of the argumentation theories underlying the systems has culminated in the logical system DefLog that formalizes the interpretation of prima facie justified assumptions. DefLog introduces an innovative use of conditionals expressing support and attack. This allows the expression of warrants for support and attack, making it a transparent and flexible system of defeasible argumentation...|$|R
