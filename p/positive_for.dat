For ambivalents the result showed that they had a negative strong relationship <b>for</b> job satisfaction, <b>positive</b> weak relationship <b>for</b> communication apprehension, negative moderate relationship for nonverbal immediacy, no relationship for assertiveness, and negative weak relationship for responsiveness. For the indifferents it showed that they had a negative moderate relationship for job satisfaction, no relationship for communication apprehension, no relationship for nonverbal immediacy, a negative weak relationship for assertiveness and no relationship for responsiveness. For the upward mobile it showed that there was a <b>positive</b> weak relationship <b>for</b> job satisfaction, negative weak relationship <b>for</b> communication apprehension, <b>positive</b> moderate relationship <b>for</b> nonverbal immediacy, <b>positive</b> moderate relationship <b>for</b> assertiveness, and a <b>positive</b> moderate relationship <b>for</b> responsiveness(Pruden).For study 2 the outcome variables were job satisfaction, competence, caring, trustworthiness, extraversion, neuroticism and psychoticism.
