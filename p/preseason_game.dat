50|$|After Fox {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the NFL's National Football Conference division in 1994, KPEJ has carried <b>preseason</b> football <b>games</b> from the Dallas Cowboys, along with team owner Jerry Jones's weekly game discussion program. In 2010, KPEJ also {{acquired the}} rights to Houston Texans <b>preseason</b> <b>games,</b> which aired on tape delay if the game started while a Cowboys pre-game broadcast or pre-season game telecasts was ongoing.

5|$|Allen {{played as}} the starter at right tackle {{in each of}} the Giants' three minicamps prior to the 2004 preseason, but {{incoming}} head coach Tom Coughlin moved right guard David Diehl to the right tackle position before the first <b>preseason</b> <b>game.</b> Allen was originally designated the primary backup at left and right tackle going into the 2004 season, but he was released after the Giants signed Marques Sullivan off waivers.|$|E
5|$|The Bears preseason {{schedule}} {{was released on}} April 9. The team opened the preseason at home against the Miami Dolphins, who had defeated the Bears in their meeting in 2014, followed by visiting two 2014 playoff teams in the Indianapolis Colts and Cincinnati; the Bears had last faced the two teams in the season openers of 2012 and 2013, respectively.

5|$|The Jacksonville Jaguars claimed Kafka off waivers on June 11, 2013, one {{day after}} his release by the Patriots. The Dallas Cowboys had also put in a claim for him. The general manager for the Jaguars, Dave Caldwell, said on June 13 that Kafka had as good of a chance at being named the {{starting}} quarterback as Blaine Gabbert, Chad Henne, or Matt Scott had. Kafka was the third quarterback {{to play in the}} first <b>preseason</b> <b>game</b> for the Jaguars on August 9 against the Miami Dolphins after Henne and Gabbert. He went 4-of-8 for 19yards and an interception in the game. In the second week of the preseason, he went 1-for-3 for −4yards. He did not play in the team's third <b>preseason</b> <b>game,</b> but passed for 46yards and a touchdown in the fourth game. The Jaguars signed Ricky Stanzi on August 27 for additional competition for the team's third quarterback job. Kafka and Scott were both released in favor of Stanzi during final roster cuts on August 30, 2013.|$|E

50|$|From {{the late}} 1980s to 2000, the Chargers wore white at home during some <b>preseason</b> <b>games</b> and dark for regular season games. In 2001, the Chargers started wearing their dark uniforms for <b>preseason</b> <b>games</b> and white uniforms in September home games {{due to the}} heat before {{switching}} back to dark in October.|$|R
5|$|Before the 2003 season, both Jason Whittle and Mike Rosenthal {{left the}} Giants via free agency, leaving two {{starting}} positions {{open on the}} offensive line. By {{the start of the}} Giants' pre-season minicamp, Allen was considered the favorite to start at right tackle, but he remained in competition with four other players for the two starting roles. The newly constructed right side of the offensive line played poorly in the first <b>preseason</b> <b>game</b> against the New England Patriots, but Allen showed enough improvement the following week against the Carolina Panthers to be named the starter going into the regular season.|$|E
5|$|For the 2013 campaign, Ryan {{overhauled}} {{his coaching}} staff, promoting Dennis Thurman to defensive coordinator while adding several new coaches including offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg. Newly hired general manager John Idzik emphasized {{there would be}} competition at all positions including quarterback. The Jets drafted Geno Smith {{in the second round}} of the 2013 NFL Draft to compete with Sanchez. Ryan was widely criticized for his decision to insert Sanchez late in a <b>preseason</b> <b>game</b> against the New York Giants after Sanchez suffered a season-ending shoulder injury which led to Smith being named the starter.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Steelers {{played the}} Philadelphia Eagles in a <b>preseason</b> <b>game</b> {{to commemorate the}} 60th anniversary of the Steagles team, when the two merged {{as a result of}} player {{shortages}} caused by World War II. Steelers president Dan Rooney had initially considered wearing a throwback uniform for the game, but decided against it because the merged team wore the Eagles uniforms, and the Steelers didn't want to wear the Eagles' colors. Instead, the team had the south end zone painted in plain diagonal white lines, which were common in NFL endzones until the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|On August 28, 2014, Manning {{was fined}} $8,268 for taunting D. J. Swearinger during a <b>preseason</b> <b>game</b> against the Houston Texans. With the Broncos' win in their opening {{game of the}} 2014 NFL season against the Indianapolis Colts, Manning became, along with Brett Favre, {{one of only two}} {{starting}} quarterbacks in NFL history who have beaten all 32 teams. On October 5, 2014, Manning threw his 500th career touchdown pass to Julius Thomas against the Arizona Cardinals, and also tied Dan Marino for the most 400 yard games by a quarterback.|$|E
5|$|After {{holding out}} for 21 days, Davis was signed {{initially}} to a contract designed as a temporary compromise {{in order to get}} him into training camp on August 5, 1991. It was speculated that the reason behind Davis' holdout and the temporary compromise was that Davis and his agent wanted to see what McRae, who also held out with the Buccaneers, signed for first. Davis was not allowed to practice with the team until he was under contract, thus the compromise contract enabled him to practice while still work to get a long-term deal done. The compromise was a one-year contract with an option for a second year, and Davis received $600,000 in signing the first contract. He was able to play against the Cincinnati Bengals in the Eagles' third <b>preseason</b> <b>game</b> on August 10. Davis was projected to be the Eagles' starting right offensive tackle for the 1991 season. Davis suffered a sprained ankle while running laps around JFK Stadium and tripping over a goal post support on August 19. Due to the injury, he was taken out of the <b>preseason</b> <b>game</b> against the Indianapolis Colts on August 23 at halftime by Kotite. The Eagles and Davis finalized a five-year contract worth $4.6 million on September 6 following {{the first week of the}} season. Davis changed his jersey number from 77 to 78 after signing the contract. He had his best game of the season in week four against the Pittsburgh Steelers on September 22, as Kotite called more run plays to the right side towards the end of the game. Davis had a key block on a Jim McMahon quarterback sneak touchdown and McMahon gave Davis the ball immediately after to spike in celebration. The Eagles were given a five-yard penalty for the spike, however. In a week five game against the Washington Redskins on September 30, Davis gave up two sacks against defensive end Charles Mann, who received Pro Bowl honors after the season. Davis gave up a total of ten sacks in the first five games of the season.|$|E
5|$|After the Chiefs {{acquired}} quarterback Matt Cassel {{from the}} New England Patriots, Croyle entered training camp competing against Tyler Thigpen for a roster spot as backup quarterback. The first depth chart {{in training camp}} listed Croyle as the second quarterback ahead of Thigpen. Croyle entered the Chiefs' first <b>preseason</b> <b>game</b> of 2009 (against the Houston Texans) as the second quarterback and finished as the team's leading passer (12-of-18 for 145 yards) and looked poised throughout the evening to post a 91.2 quarterback rating. The Chiefs {{would go on to}} lose the game 16–10. After quarterback Matt Cassel was injured on August 29 against the Seattle Seahawks, Croyle started the final game of the preseason against the St. Louis Rams.|$|E
