40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study <b>was</b> to examine <b>practice</b> {{scheduling}} and composition in judo based upon motor learning theory. Practice scheduling and composition of Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusokurenshu were analyzed from the case of the practice of A University judo team. A University judo team has a competitive level of participating in the national collegiate judo tournament. The viewpoints of analysis by motor learning theory were massed and distributed practice, random and blocked practice, whole and part practice, and variable and constant practice. Results demonstrated as follows. Massed and distributed practice, and Random and blocked <b>practice</b> <b>were</b> scheduled in Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Whole <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu and Yakusoku-renshu by fractionation, while part <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Whole <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu by simplification, while part <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu, Kakarirenshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Whole <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu and Yakusoku-renshu by segmentation, while part <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Variable and constant <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Specific training methods were proposed for each practice...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCharacterization of {{the spatial}} {{organization}} of agricultural <b>practices</b> <b>is</b> required for {{an assessment of}} the risks of diffuse pollution by pesticides. In the case of a vineyard catchment in Southern France, the authors hypothesized that the diversity of weed control <b>practices</b> <b>is</b> spatially organized at different levels. The <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> characterized on the basis of interviews with 27 vine-growers belonging to two different wineries. Three <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> differentiated according to the intensity of herbicide use. The results showed that field characteristics related to inter-row width {{play an important role in}} the weed control choices but fully make sense in the context of the holding, where choices of <b>practices</b> <b>are</b> related to the size of the workforce and the structure of the vineyard. The supply basin of a co-operative winery appeared as a third level of organization of the practices as the wineries direct the structure of their members' vineyards through their incentive policy. Finally, the possibility of using the results to localize weed control <b>practices</b> <b>is</b> discussed...|$|R

5|$|Access {{to foreign}} {{carriers}} on domestic routes is disallowed, while international flights {{will be subject}} to bilateral agreements. To get around this policy, in order to operate within Indonesia, foreign airlines first have to own and operate an Indonesian-based airline.

5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E

5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim the <b>practice</b> <b>is</b> overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect {{is often more}} difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E
