40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} how an artificial lift method {{in the oil industry}} works,and to compare its performance with other <b>pump</b> systems. <b>Jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are initially used in the oil industry for artificial lift and thus in order to do so one needs a good understanding of themechanics to predict the jet pumps’ performance. The project will begin with a review of how the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> operates, aiming to give the reader an insight and overview into the field of an artificial lift method. Primary literature was gathered by searching the SPE online library whereby the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> has received much attention in the literature. The project will first focus on the theoretical functioning of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> and show how an optimum design can be achieved by changing different parameters. The second section involves case studies where the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> has been used as an artificial lift method. First when it is used in an inaccessible location, offshore and finally lifting heavy oils. In the case studies the design of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> parameters were achieved by searching available literature and the use of in-house software. The use of in-house software and the lack of field data presented made it difficult to compare field results with theoretical performances. In all case studies the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> increased production. * The <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> proved to be very reliable * Low installation and operation costs and * Can be placed in highly deviated wells The above reasons can to some extent justify the low efficiency of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b> The <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performed with efficiencies lower than expected at the different fields. If we assume that the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> design is optimal and the assumptions and theoretical formulas are valid the theoretical and experimental efficiencies should be the same. To determine if this statement is correct an experimental study of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> was conducted. An experimental test lop was designed and constructed to conduct the experimental study. The <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> was constructed based on one-dimensional formulation. Water was used forboth the primary and secondary flow. The water <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance was then investigated. The highest efficiency achieved was 10 %, which was 5 - 7 % below theoretical efficiency.

40|$|The {{design of}} compact thermoacoustic devices {{requires}} compact <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> geometries, {{which can be}} realized by employing <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> with multiple orifices.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} model is used to predict the oscillatory flow through tapered cylindrical tube sections (<b>jet</b> <b>pumps).</b> The asymmetric shape of <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> results in a time-averaged pressure drop {{that can be used}} to suppress Gedeon streaming in closed-loop thermoacoustic devices. However, previous work has shown that flow separation in the diverging flow direction counteracts the time-averaged pressure drop. In this work, the characteristics of flow separation in <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are identified and coupled with the observed <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance. Furthermore, it is shown that the onset of flow separation can be shifted to larger displacement amplitudes by designs that have a smoother transition between the small opening and the tapered surface of the <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b> These design alterations also reduce the duration of separated flow, resulting in more effective and robust <b>jet</b> <b>pumps.</b> To make the proposed <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> designs more compact without reducing their performance, the minimum big opening radius that can be implemented before the local minor losses have an influence on the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance is investigated.

40|$|Abstract — The {{experiment}} {{was about to}} study of water <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> with different diameters and nozzle-to-throat area ratios. Most experimental studies on water <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> mainly carried out to assess the maximum efficiency. But maximum efficiency occurs when the suction lift is relatively small for a given head loss through the pump, which implies, when the suction flow rate is maximum. However, suction lift is inversely proportional to flow rate. But {{in the field of}} application there are many cases (such as drainage, dredging, well-pumping and other systems) where suction lift is more important factor than any other for water <b>jet</b> <b>pumps,</b> which gives importance to the assessment of depending factor of suction lift of water <b>jet</b> <b>pumps.</b> Six different <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> of two different nominal diameter each of three different nozzle to throat area ratio were made to carry out this experiment.

40|$|The {{oscillatory flow}} through tapered {{cylindrical}} tube sections (<b>jet</b> <b>pumps)</b> {{is characterized by}} a numerical parameter study. The shape of a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> results in asymmetric hydrodynamic end effects which cause a time-averaged pressure drop to occur under oscillatory flow conditions. Hence, <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are used as streaming suppressors in closed-loop thermoacoustic devices. A two-dimensional axisymmetric computational fluid dynamics model is used to calculate the performance {{of a large number of}} conical <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> geometries in terms of time-averaged pressure drop and acoustic power dissipation. The investigated geometrical parameters include the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> length, taper angle, waist diameter and waist curvature. In correspondence with previous work, four flow regimes are observed which characterize the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> performance and dimensionless parameters are introduced to scale the performance of the various <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> geometries. The simulation results are compared to an existing quasi-steady theory and it is shown that this theory is only applicable in a small operation region.
