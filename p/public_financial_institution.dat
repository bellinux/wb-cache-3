40|$|There are two {{different}} views {{on the effects of}} <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> on corporate debt restructuring : the soft budget view and the hard budget view. The former view, which is held by Kornai (1979, 1983), Dewatripont and Maskin (1995), and others insists that because centralized <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> have difficulty committing themselves to refrain from providing additional funds to distressed firms, corporate reorganizations often result in overinvestment. On the other hand, the latter view argues that <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> should prefer corporate liquidation rather than the continuation of business because <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> are secured by mortgages to a greater extent and are more reluctant to forgive the debts than private <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> In this paper, I have empirically examined the role and impact of <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> government-affiliated <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> in particular, from the viewpoints of debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and bankruptcy procedures for distressed firms. The conclusions of this paper are as follows. In the DIP financing, the Development Bank of Japan always takes the lead, followed by private <b>financial</b> <b>institutions.</b> Namely, so-called cowbell effect may exist, which is inconsistent with the hard budget view. Regarding the selection of bankruptcy procedures, firms that owed to government-affiliated <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> have a tendency to opt for private procedures which have the effect of delaying a drastic debt restructuring. This is consistent with the soft budget view. <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> bankruptcy procedures, debtor-in-possession financing...|$|R

40|$|While <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> (such as <b>public</b> {{development}} banks) {{are commonly}} associated with developing countries, in fact they are prevalent {{in the developed world}} as well. We study a sample of <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> in industrialized countries and identify dominant trends in their organization and oversight. While practices in developed countries may be a useful reference point, a more nuanced approach, accounting for the disparity of institutional environment, regulatory capacity, and government accountability and effectiveness, may be required in developing countries.

40|$|The large {{weight of}} <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> is often {{identified}} {{as one of}} the characteristics of the Japanese financial system. It is believed that reform of the private financial sector is not enough to revitalize the Japanese financial system, but reform of the <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> sector is crucial. There are various opinions concerning ideal <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> and heated debate continues. We would like to raise attention to the point that much discourse is based on the prerequisite that <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> sector is still increasing (i. e., the ballooning theory). However, {{only a small number of}} arguments present grounds for the prerequisite, and even in the case of those based on statistical analyses, such analyses are not rigorously verified. Under these circumstances, the first purpose of this paper is to reverify the ballooning theory of <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> sector which is used as a prerequisite for much of the discourse. Of course, although the ballooning theory may be overstated, private <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> cries for help strongly suggest that they are being squeezed by public institutions. The reason why <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> that should be tightly regulated have such great power and oppress the private sector, which has been significantly deregulated in recent years, is often thought to be because so many privileges are given to <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> as government enterprises (the privileged government enterprise theory). We agree that government enterprises have privileges, but if these are small, it is difficult to say that they are the main cause of the competitive dominance of government enterprises. The size of the privileges must be quantified to assess the privileged government enterprise theory. This is the second purpose of this paper. The following are the major conclusions of this paper. Concerning the <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> sector ballooning theory, various indexes prove that <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> activities had increased in share by around 1998, so from this aspect the ballooning theory is correct. However, this situation changed and since 1998 public financialactivities have either remained at the same level or have tended to decline. Further attention should be paid to the fact that when examining the relative size of <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> activities, the result varies significantly depending on how the area of interest is set. For instance, if finance is viewed as a risk bearing mechanism rather than a flow of funds, public involvement in finance in the U. S. may be greater than in Japan. Concerning the privileged government enterprise theory, it is true that Japan Post has privileges (e. g., the exemption of taxes as current expenses), but the estimate of 4. 6 trillion over ten years by the Japanese Bankers Association is considered to be excessive. It may be judged that most of the privileges of the government enterprise have been eliminated during the establishment process of Japan Post and the conditions of government enterprise for competition are almost equalized with the private sector, On the other hand, government enterprise may become unable to bear the burden caused by restrictions imposed on them any longer (particularly the obligation of maintaining offices in remote areas), so how Japan Post can bear the burden must be considered. This paper is organized as follows. Section II examines the ballooning of the <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> sector, which is treated as the starting point of the debate concerning the reform of <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> system in Japan. Section III reverifies the privileges enjoyed by government enterprises. Section IV presents the conclusions of this paper. <b>Public</b> <b>Financial</b> System, Japan, ballooning theory, enterprise theory...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to propose an econometric model to estimate the risk of default on financing granted by a <b>public</b> <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> in the state of Minas Gerais. In elaborating this model data from contracts, socioeconomic inputs of partners and guarantors of and economic-financial information of the companies were used from a sample of 9, 232 firms drawn from a population of 25, 616 cases of financing for micro and small enterprises made between Jun. / 97 and Dec. / 05. A Hierarchical Logistic Regression Analysis was used in which the dependent variable was the quality of credit as defined by timely payments or default of the loan transaction. A total of 22 independent variables related to the contract, the company and the partners/guarantors were used of which five emerged as important in predicting insolvency and correctly classifying 88. 5 % of the companies. In conclusion, one can say that the amount financed and hence the proportion of this funding consumed bring about conditions for default, while the value of the assets of the guarantor in relation to the financing, the value of fixed investments and the age of the company act as protectors against default...|$|E
