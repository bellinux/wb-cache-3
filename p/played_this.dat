5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 31,000 tickets. Cardiff fans would be {{housed in the}} East End of the stadium, while Liverpool fans were allocated the West End of the stadium. Ticket prices were increased from last year's final, with the most expensive tickets costing £90 up £4 from the previous year. The least expensive tickets cost £40, which was £2 more than last year. It was decided that before the match started national anthems would not be <b>played.</b> <b>This</b> {{decision was made to}} avoid spectators jeering the anthems, as happened during the 2008 FA Cup Final between Portsmouth and Cardiff.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of his {{retirement}} in 1948, Bradman had made twenty-nine centuries in eighty innings. These centuries, with which he had accumulated 5,393 of his 6,996 Test runs, were scored with a 36.25% ratio of centuries per innings <b>played.</b> <b>This</b> allowed him to maintain a career batting average of 99.94, while no other batsman has been able to reach 61. He would have retired with an average of 100 had he scored four more runs in his final innings.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1912 Lasker {{entered into}} {{negotiations}} {{for a world}} title match with Akiba Rubinstein, whose tournament record for the previous few years {{had been on a}} par with Lasker's and a little ahead of Capablanca's. The two players agreed to play a match if Rubinstein could raise the funds, but Rubinstein had few rich friends to back him and the match was never <b>played.</b> <b>This</b> situation demonstrated some of the flaws inherent in the championship system then being used. The start of World War I in summer 1914 put an end to hopes that Lasker would play either Rubinstein or Capablanca for the World Championship in the near future.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} formed {{following}} {{a meeting at}} the Eastville Restaurant in Bristol in September 1883.

5|$|Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a {{negative}} score are automatically {{eliminated from the}} game at that point and awarded the third place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was <b>played.</b> <b>This</b> rule is still in-place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested {{that it is not}} set in stone and that executive producer Harry Friedman may decide to display the clue for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur. During Celebrity Jeopardy! games, contestants with a $0 or negative score are given $1,000 for the Final Jeopardy! round.|$|E
5|$|Hirst {{received}} little coaching as a batsman. Physically brave, {{he was often}} at his best on pitches which were difficult for batting, and when his team faced a crisis. His usual approach was to bat aggressively. Although he could play defensively if required, he preferred to attack when his team were in difficulties. He played a variety of strokes, but he favoured the on drive and particularly the pull and hook shots. He was able to pull and hook almost any ball delivered to him, {{making it difficult to}} place fielders effectively while he was batting. Only in Australia did this approach prove less successful. He also established a reputation as an outstanding fielder at mid off. In this position, he took many catches, often from hard drives in an era when batsmen <b>played</b> <b>this</b> shot very well.|$|E
