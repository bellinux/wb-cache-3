40|$|The {{reaction}} of Mn(ClO 4) (2) center dot 6 H(2) O, a derivatised <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxime</b> (R-saoH(2)) and the ligand tris(2 -pyridylmethyl) amine (tpa) in a basic alcoholic solution {{leads to the}} formation of a family of cluster compounds of general formula [(Mn 2 O) -O-III(R-sao) (tpa) (2) ](ClO 4) (2) (1, R = H; 2, R = Me; 3, R = Et; 4, R = Ph). The structure is that of a simple, albeit asymmetric, dimer of two Mn-III ions bridged through one mu-O 2 - ion and the -N-O- moiety of the <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxime.</b> Magnetometry reveals that the exchange interaction between the two MnIII ions in complexes 1, 3 and 4 is antiferromagnetic, but that for complex 2 is ferromagnetic. A theoretically developed magneto-structural correlation reveals that the dominant structural parameter influencing the sign and magnitude of the pairwise interaction is the dihedral Mn-O-N-Mn (torsion) angle. A linear correlation is found, with the magnitude of J varying significantly as the dihedral angle is altered. As the torsion angle increases the AF exchange decreases, matching the experimentally determined data. DFT calculations reveal that the (dyz) vertical bar pi vertical bar d(yz) interaction decreases as the dihedral angle increases leading to ferromagnetic coupling at larger angles...|$|E
40|$|The syntheses and {{characterisation}} of polynuclear {{metal clusters}} using {{a series of}} derivatised salicylaldoxime ligands are described in this thesis. The polynuclear iron clusters contain metallic cores consisting of oxo-centred triangles. It was found that slight modifications of the <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxime</b> ligands can lead to metal clusters with different nuclearities, thus producing a variety of magnetic properties within the materials. The predominant building block in the complexes is a triangular [Fe 3 O(Rsao) 3]+ (R = alkyl derivative, sao = salicylaldoxime) unit which can self-assemble into more complicated arrays depending on reaction conditions. A number of ligands containing a single <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxime</b> unit has been synthesised. These ligands {{have been used to}} form di-iron (C 1), hexairon (C 2), and heptairon (C 3) complexes. A second series of ligands containing two double-headed <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxime</b> units linked by diamine straps has been synthesised and fully characterised. Two copper complexes C 5 and C 7 were crystallised and pyridine also took part in coordination to the copper centres. Three of the iron complexes formed with double-headed oxime ligands are heptairon compounds. The heptairon compounds were all analogous in their iron coordination environment. The hexairon complex (C 8) formed from a double-headed oxime was analogous to the complex C 2 formed from a single-headed oxime ligand in its iron coordination environment. The tri-iron complex (C 10) also contains a metaborate ion. In each case of the heptairon complexes and the hexairon complex, the metallic skeleton of the cluster was based on a trigonal prism in which two [O] triangles are fastened together via three helically twisted double-headed oxime ligands. Each of these ligands is present as (L- 2 H) where the oximic and phenolic O-atoms are deprotonated and the amino N-atoms protonated, with the oxime moieties bridging across the edges of the metal triangles. The identity of the metal ion has a major impact on the nuclearity and topology of the resultant cluster. The magnetic susceptibility measurements of these iron complexes suggest the presence of strong antiferromagnetic interactions between the metal centres and the Mössbauer analyses confirm the oxidation state of all the iron centres is 3 +. The CHN analyses and other general characterisation allowed verifying and / or modifying the formulae generated by the X-ray analyses...|$|E

Controlled bromination of the aromatic ring gave the monobromo oxime (9), the dibromo oxime (10), or the spiroisoxazoline (11) depending upon reaction conditions. Synthesis {{of the known}} metabolite verongamine (15) was achieved by oxidation of O-methyl bromotyrosine methyl ester and amidation of the resulting oxime ester (14) with histamine. The mono- and di-bromotyrosine oxime derivatives (9 and 10) were further transformed into the naturally occurring nitriles (16 and 17) by base hydrolysis of the ester and acid-catalyzed decarboxylation. Wadsworth−Emmons olefination of the dibromobenzaldehyde (20 b) with phosphonate (18) gave the pyruvate silylenolether (21 b). Deprotection and in situ oxime formation gave the oxime ester (23 b). Attempted purification of the pyruvate ester resulted in a homoaldol condensation yielding butenolide (22). Amidation of the oxime ester (23 b) with histamine, followed by deprotection of the MOM ether gave the first synthesis of purealidin N (28). Oxidative spirocyclization of the <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxime</b> ester (23 d) with a polymer-bound iodosyl diacetate gave the spiroisoxazoline (24) and represents a formal synthesis of aerothionin (26 a), homoaerothionin (26 b), and aerophobin- 1 (25) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{and study}} of a systematic series of <b>phenolic</b> <b>oximes</b> have shown that substitution in the 3 -position can greatly affect extractive efficacy. Solid state, solution and gas phase analytical techniques including X-ray crystallography, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and IR spectroscopy and collision induced dissociation mass spectrometry have been assessed for their applicability in interpreting the origins of differences in extractant strength. The dominant substituent effect on pH(0. 5) is the change in ligand pK(a), with the more acidic ligands being stronger extractants. The influence of the 3 -substituent on the stabilizing intracomplex H-bonding of their copper(II) complexes also affects extractant strength. The 3 -NO 2 substituted ligand shows the lowest pH(0. 5) value due {{to a combination of}} its low pK(a) and a stabilising bifurcated H-bond assembly around the copper(II) centre. Appending an aminomethyl group to the 3 -position gives a ligand capable of binding a metal and its attendant anion(s). These metal salt reagents show potential to open up new flowsheets for the processing of high tenor copper feeds...|$|R
40|$|While the {{phenolic}} oximes (R-saoH(2)) {{are well}} known for producing monometallic complexes of the type [MII(R-saoH) (2) ] with Cu-II ions in near quantitative yield, their derivatisation {{opens the door to}} much more varied and interesting coordination chemistry. Here we show that combining the complimentary diethanolamine and <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxime</b> moieties into one organic framework (H 4 L 1 and H 4 L 2) allows for the preparation and isolation of an unusual family of [Cu-II](n) wheels, including saddle-shaped, single-stranded [Cu- 8 (II) ] wheels of general formula [Cu- 8 (HL 1) (4) (X) (4) ] n[Y] (when n = 0, X = Cl-, NO 3 -, AcO-, N- 3 (-); when n = 2 +X = (OAc) (2) /(2, 2 '-bpy) (2) and Y = [BF 4](2)) and [Cu- 8 (HL 2) (4) (X) (4) ](X = Cl-, Br-), a rectangular [Cu- 6 (HL 1) (4) ] wheel, and a heterometallic [Cu 4 Na 2 (HL 1) 2 (H 2 L 1) (2) ] hexagon. Magnetic studies show very strong antiferromagnetic exchange between neighbouring metal ions, leading to diamagnetic ground states in all cases. DFT studies reveal that the magnitude of the exchange constants are correlated to the Cu-N-O-Cu dihedral angles, which in turn are correlated to the planarity/puckering of the [Cu-II](n) rings...|$|E

SEA would like to thank the Royal Society and Wolfson Foundation for a merit award. Work at the TU Berlin has been carried out within the EU Marie-Curie Initial Training Network “pNMR”. 1 H and 13 C pNMR properties of bis(salicylaldoximato) copper(II) were studied in the solid state using magic-angle-spinning NMR spectroscopy and, for the isolated complex and selected oligomers, using density-functional theory at the PBE 0 - 1 / 3 // PBE 0 -D 3 level. Large paramagnetic shifts are observed, up to δ(1 H) = 272 ppm and δ(13 C) = 1006 ppm (at 298 K), which are rationalised through spin delocalisation from the metal onto the organic ligand and the resulting contact shifts arising from hyperfine coupling. The observed shift ranges are best reproduced computationally using exchange-correlation functionals with a high fraction of exact exchange (such as PBE 0 - 1 / 3). Through a combination of experimental techniques and first-principles computation, a near-complete assignment of the observed signals is possible. Intermolecular effects on the pNMR shifts, modelled computationally in the dimers and trimers through effective decoupling between the local spins via A-tensor and total spin rescaling in the pNMR expression, are indicated to be small. Addition of electron-donating substituents and benzannelation of the organic ligand is predicted computationally to induce notable changes in the NMR signal pattern, suggesting that pNMR spectroscopy can be a sensitive probe for the spin distribution in paramagnetic <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxime</b> copper complexes.

40|$|Copper {{complexes}} of the <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxime</b> {{family of}} ligands (3 -X-salicylaldoximes) are used extensively as metal solvent extractants. Incorporation of electronegative substituents in the 3 -position, ortho to the phenol group, {{can be used}} to buttress the interligand H-bonding, leading to an enhancement in extractant strength. However, investigation of the relevant H-bonding in these complexes can be exceedingly difficult. Here, we have combined EPR, ENDOR, DFT, and X-ray crystallography to study this effect. Analysis of the 1 H ENDOR data revealed a variation in the Cu···H 16 (oxime proton) distance from 2. 92 Å for the unsubstituted complex [Cu(L 2) 2] to 3. 65 Å for the X = CH 2 N(C 6 H 13) 2 substituted complex [Cu(L 3) 2]. DFT calculations showed that this variation is caused by changes to the length and strength of the H-bond between the oximic hydrogen and the phenolate oxygen. Noticeable changes to the Cu···H 15 (azomethine proton) distances and the Cu···N bonding parameters were also observed in the two complexes, as revealed through the NA and NQ ENDOR data. Distortions {{in the structure of the}} complex and variations in the oximic proton to phenolate oxygen H-bond strength caused by the substituent (X) were confirmed by DFT and X-ray crystallography. DFT directly evidenced the importance of the interaction between H 16 and the amine nitrogen of CH 2 N(C 6 H 13) 2 in the buttressed complex and indicated that the high strength of this interaction may not necessarily lead to an enhancement of copper extraction, as it can impose an unfavorable geometry in the inner coordination sphere of the complex. Therefore, ENDOR, DFT, and X-ray structural data all indicate that the aminomethyl substituent (X) ortho to the phenolic oxygen atom provides a particularly strong buttressing of interligand H-bonding in these copper complexes and that these outer sphere interactions can significantly influence structure and stability...|$|E

40|$|Chapter 1 of {{this thesis}} {{contains}} an extensive literature review of magneto-structural correlations (MSCs) {{of a range}} of transition metal dimers. Different structural parameters are considered and a critical assessment is given of the principal factors influencing the exchange interactions in each case. Following this, two different synthetic strategies for the synthesis of polymetallic systems are compared and contrasted. Their role in the formation of paramagnetic frameworks is also considered. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of a family of MnIII dimers and highlights the importance of chelating ligands in their formation and magnetic properties. A family of MnIII dimers of general formula of [MnIII 2 (R-sao) 2 (dpa) 2](ClO 4) 2 (1 - 5) has been synthesised using derivatised <b>phenolic</b> <b>oximes</b> (R-saoH 2, where R=H, Me, Et, Ph) in combination with di-(2 -picolyl) -amine (dpa).

Dc magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that the exchange interactions between the MnIII metal centres in 1 - 5 are antiferromagnetic in contrast to that observed for 6 and 7 which are ferromagnetic. DFT calculations have also been undertaken in order to confirm these findings. Chapter 3 describes the synthesis of a family of novel cages from the metalloligand [FeIIIL 3], where HL = 1 -(4 -pyridyl) butane- 1, 3 -dione and metal salts CuBr 2, Cu(NO 3) 2, NiCl 2, CoCl 2 Co(SCN) 2, ZnBr 2 and Pd(OTf) 2 (where OTf = triflate anion). The flexibility in the design of these structures offers huge potential to tune their physical properties as the constituent parts of the cage can be altered without any change to the structure. Due to the large size of the internal cavity, {{it is possible that the}} cage could play host to different species, such as magnetic guests, which would then exert control over the exchange interaction between the metal ions in the host framework and between the host and guest(s).

40|$|This thesis {{involves}} {{the design and}} development of reagents for the recovery of base metals (specifically zinc, nickel and cobalt) in hydrometallurgical solvent extraction processes. The work aims to demonstrate how ligand design can affectively tune the strength and selectivity of extractants to achieve efficient recovery of the desired base metals. Chapter 1 reviews current solvent extraction processes used in extractive metallurgy, encompassing both the well established technologies developed for sulfate streams {{as well as those}} more recently explored for treating chloride streams. Also reviewed, {{is the nature of the}} chemical binding involved in the three key modes of extraction; namely cation transport, anion transport and metal salt transport. Chapter 2 summarises the methodologies that have been established during this research for the appropriate testing of these reagents. Chapter 3 deals exclusively with the processing of zinc sulfide ores with an aim to design reagents to achieve concentration and separation of zinc in chloride hydrometallurgical circuits. The amido functionalised reagents that are reported have a common structural feature with ligands that have been previously studied by the Tasker group (Ross J. Ellis Thesis, University of Edinburgh, 2009). A six membered chelate ring is formed by a protonated amino nitrogen atom and an amido oxygen atom in a sequence of the type R 2 HN+-CH 2 -NR-CO-R. This differs from those previously studied which have a sequence of the type R 2 HN+-CH 2 -CHR-CO-NR 2. The pro-ligands (L) operate via an anion exchange mechanism (Equation 1) whereby two protonated ligands (LH+) coordinate to the outersphere of anionic zinc(II) or iron(III) chloridometalates from acid chloride solutions using both N-H and C-H hydrogen-bond donors. pH dependent solvent extraction experiments have concluded that this reagent series achieves zinc(II) loading with pH 0. 5 values that are competitive with the previous ligand series (Ross J. Ellis Thesis, University of Edinburgh, 2009). Chloride concentration dependent solvent extraction experiments have demonstrated that the reagents show an unusually good selectivity for ZnCl 4 2 - over chloride or FeCl 4 - in equilibrium of the type; yLorg + yH+ +MClx y- ⇌ [(LH) yMClx](org) (1) The development of bidentate and tridentate pyrazolone-based pro-ligands for the extraction of nickel and cobalt from mixed metal sulfate streams is considered in Chapters 4 and 5. These reagents (LH) operate via metal cation transport, where an inner-sphere complex of nickel(II) or cobalt(II) is formed with the ligand (L-) see Equation 2. A combination of N, O and S donors has been incorporated into 1 -phenyl- 3 -methyl- 4 - acylpyrazol- 5 -ones and their respective 4 -acylpyrazolone oximes in order to tune the bidentate ligands (L-) for optimal coordination with nickel(II) or cobalt(II). Substituent effects have also been investigated, by synthesising a series of 1 -(2 -X-phenyl) - 3 -methyl- 4 - acylpyrazol- 5 -one oximes [X = Cl, H]. Substitution in the 3 -position of the phenol group in <b>phenolic</b> <b>oximes</b> has been reported to increase extractant strength for copper by two orders of magnitude (Ross S. Forgan Thesis, University of Edinburgh, 2008). Similar improvements were not observed in this study. The nature of this effect has been attributed to buttressing of hydrogen-bonds, where the substituent forms a stabilising, bifurcated hydrogen-bond between the oximic hydrogen and the pyrazolonic oxygen. yLHorg + My+ ⇌ [(L) yM]org + yH+ (2) Tridentate analogues of the oxime reagents above have been prepared as imines derived from anilines contained o-O, S or N donor atoms.

Chapter 6 focuses of the development of bidentate pyrazolethiones for the selective extraction of cobalt from manganese in acidic sulfate streams. These reagents have been designed to favour coordination to metals in a tetrahedral geometry as shown by L. Emeleus and A.

Phenolic oximes are known to form monometallic complexes with CuII ions, as are the diethanolamines.

In each case nearest neighbour interactions between CuII ions are shown to be strongly antiferromagnetic.

Chapter four straps two salicylaldoxime units together in the 3 -position, using ligands with aliphatic a,W-aminomethyl links, allowing the assembly of the polynuclear complexes [Fe 7 O 2 (OH) 6 (H 2 L 1) 3 (py) 6](BF 4) 5 · 6 H 2 O· 14 MeOH (23 · 6 H 2 O· 14 MeOH), [Fe 6 O(OH) 7 (H 2 L 2) 3][(BF 4) 3]· 4 H 2 O· 9 MeOH (24 · 4 H 2 O· 9 MeOH) and [Mn 6 O 2 (OH) 2 (H 2 L 1) 3 (py) 4 (MeCN) 2](BF 4) 5 (NO 3) · 3 MeCN·H 2 O· 5 py (25 · 3 MeCN·H 2 O· 5 py). In each case the metallic skeleton of the cluster is based on a trigonal prism in which two [MIII 3 O] triangles are tethered together via three helically twisted double-headed oximes. The latter are present as H 2 L 2 - in which the oximic and phenolic O-atoms are deprotonated and the amino N-atoms protonated, with the oxime moieties bridging across the edges of the metal triangles. Both the identity of the metal ion and the length of the straps connecting the salicylaldoxime units {{have a major impact on}} the nuclearity and topology of the resultant cage, with, perhaps counter-intuitively, the longer straps producing the “smallest” clusters.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of mass {{spectrometry}} to define the strengths, and understand solution phase speciation of phenolic oxime-based solvent extractants of the types used in the hydrometallurgical recovery of copper. Chapter 1 reviews briefly the current extraction technology for copper and focuses on hydrometallurgy and {{the use of}} <b>phenolic</b> <b>oximes</b> such as 5 -nonylsalicylaldoxime. The modification of the latter to improve extraction efficiency is discussed, focussing on the introduction of X-substituents in the 3 position of the benzene ring. Modern mass spectrometry techniques are also discussed with a focus on their application to inorganic systems and their use in achieving the aims of this thesis, as defined above. The work described in chapter 2 involves the development of collision induced dissociation (CID) techniques to determine the relative gas phase stabilities of copper complex anions of the type [Cu(L) (L-H) ]-, where LH is a 5 -alkyl- 3 -X- 2 - hydroxybenzaldehyde oximes and X a range of substituents. The importance of interligand interactions in the outer-coordination sphere and their influence on gas phase anion stability, as defined by CID, is reported. The work described in Chapter 2 on CID is extended in chapter 3 and looks at the effect of charge, of ligand type, LH, and {{of the nature of the}} metal on the stability of ionic forms of [M(L) 2] complexes, where LH is extended to include 5 -alkyl- 2 - hydroxyphenylethanone oximes. The effects of substitution at the azomethine carbon atom and at the 3 -position of the benzene ring and of variation of the nature of the metal on the ion dissociation mechanisms are shown to have a major influence on ion stability under CID conditions. In chapter 4 density functional theory calculations have been used to investigate the influences of substitution at the azomethine carbon atom and at the 3 -position of the benzene ring and of variation of the nature of the metal on the gas phase structures of the neutral complexes, [M(L) 2]. Gas phase deprotonation and dimerisation enthalpies of the ligands, LH, and enthalpies of formation of [M(L) 2] complexes have been calculated and correlates with experimentally determined ligand extraction strength. The ligand type has been extended to include 3 -X- 2 -hydroxybenzaldehyde hydrazones, which have previously been shown to have lower distribution coefficients for copper than the analogous 3 -X-substituted oximes. The calculated gas phase formation enthalpies for [M(L) 2] show a strong correlation with the strengths as extractants LH, measured as their pH 0. 5 values for metal uptake. Chapter 5 considers whether mass spectrometry can be used to define the solution equilibria when two different oxime-based ligands, LXH and LYH, compete for Cu(II) in a single phase solution. It has been established that shifts in the relative peak intensities of deprotonated ions derived from the Cu(II) complexes, [Cu(LX) 2], [Cu(LY) 2] and [Cu(LX) (LY) ] reflect changes in the solution composition. The work described in chapter 6 extends the study of solution phase speciation using mass spectrometry. When the Cu(II) and proton concentrations of solutions were varied distinct changes in the resulting electrospray mass spectra were observed and the resulting species were identified using CID and high resolution mass spectrometry. A novel, [Cu 3 (L-H) 3 -μ 3 -O/OH]- species is determined to be a major component of solutions where Cu(II) concentrations are equal to/greater than the LH concentration. Various 3 -X- 2 -hydroxybenzaldehyde oximes (X = CH 2 NR 2) were synthesised. The incorporation of a protonatable arm in the 3 -position enabled trinuclear complexes, [Cu 3 (L-H) 3 -μ 3 -OH], to be isolated and fully characterized, including two X-ray determined crystal structures...|$|R
40|$|At {{present the}} field of {{molecular}} electronics - also known as molecular semiconductors, organic semiconductors, plastic electronics or organic electronics - is dominated by organic materials, both polymeric and molecular, with much less attention being focused on transition metal based complexes despite the advantages they can offer. Such advantages include tuneable frontier orbitals through the ligand/metal interaction {{and the ability to}} generate stable paramagnetic species. Devices containing radical materials are particularly interesting in order to examine the interplay between conduction and spin - an effect which is not yet properly understood but can give rise to exotic behaviour. A series of homoleptic, bis-ligand Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes were prepared using three structurally related <b>phenolic</b> <b>oxime</b> ligands, 2 -hydroxy- 5 -t-octylacetophenone oxime (t-OctsaoH), 2 -hydroxy- 5 -n-propylacetophenone oxime (n-PrsaoH) and 2 - hydroxyacetophenone oxime (HsaoH). The complexes were characterised by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, field-effect-transistor measurements, DFT/TD-DFT calculations {{and in the case of}} the paramagnetic species, EPR and magnetic susceptibility. Variation of the substituent on the ligand from t-octyl to n-propyl to H enabled electronic isolation of the complexes in the crystal structures of M(t-OctsaoH) 2, which contrasted with π-stacking interactions observed in the crystal packing of M(n-PrsaoH) 2 and of M(HsaoH) (M = Ni, Cu). This was further evidenced by comparing the antiferromagnetic interactions observed in samples of Cu(n-PrsaoH) 2 and Cu(HsaoH) 2 with the ideal paramagnetic behaviour for Cu(t-OctsaoH) 2 down to 1. 8 K. Despite isostructural single crystal structures for M(n-PrsaoH) 2, thin-film X-ray diffraction and SEM revealed different morphologies depending on the metal and the deposition method employed. However, the complexes of M(n-PrsaoH) 2 and M(HsaoH) failed to demonstrate significant charge transport in an FET device despite displaying the ability to form π- stacking structures. A series of planar Ni(II), Cu(II) and Co(II) dibenzotetraaza[14]annulenes (dbtaa) and dinapthotetraaza[14]annulenes (dntaa) were synthesised and studied crystallographically, optically, electrochemically and magnetically. Thin films of each of these complexes have been prepared by vacuum deposition to evaluate the field-effect transistor (FET) performance as well as the morphology and crystallinity of the film formed. Single crystal data revealed that Ni(dbtaa) and Cu(dbtaa) are isomorphous to each other, with Co(dbtaa) displaying a different crystallographic packing. The electrochemistry and UV/Vis absorption studies indicate the materials are redox active and highly coloured, with molar extinction coefficients as large as 80, 000 M- 1 cm- 1 in the visible region. The paramagnetic Cu(II) and Co(II) complexes display weak 1 -dimensional antiferromagnetic interactions and were fit to the Bonner-Fisher chain model. The data revealed that the Co(II) species possesses much stronger magnetic exchange interactions compared with the Cu(II) complex. Each of the materials formed polycrystalline films when vacuum deposited and all showed ptype field-effect transistor behaviour, with modest charge carrier mobilities in the range of 10 - 5 to 10 - 9 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1. SEM imaging of the substrates indicates that the central metal ion, and its sublimation temperature, has a crucial role in defining the morphology of the resulting film. Structurally related Cu(II) and Ni(II) dithiadiazoletetraaza[14]annulene (dttaa) macrocycles were synthesised and studied in the context of their thin film electrochemical, conducting and morphological properties. Both the Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes were found to be volatile under reduced pressure, which allowed crystals of both materials to be grown and the single crystal structures solved. Interestingly, the crystal packing of these heterocyclic macrocycles varies depending on whether the central metal ion is Cu(II) or Ni(II), which is in contrast to the analogous dibenzotetrazaannulenes complexes. Soluble Ni(II) analogues containing benzoyl groups on the meso- positions of the macrocycle (dttaaBzOR) were also prepared and contrasted with the insoluble Ni(dttaa) complexes in terms of their solution optical and electrochemical properties. Thin film electrochemical studies of Cu(dttaa) and Ni(dttaa) showed chemically reversible oxidative processes but on scanning to reductive potentials the films disintegrated almost immediately as the bulky counter tetrabutylammonium cation entered the thin film. FET studies undertaken on polycrystalline films of both complexes, using various device configurations and surface treatments, failed to realise any gate effect. Thin film XRD measurements indicate that films of both complexes formed by vacuum deposition are crystalline and contain a mixture of molecular alignments, with molecules aligning “edge on” and “face down” to the substrate. SEM imaging failed to effectively resolve the morphology of the films implying the sizes of the crystallites are small, which may help to explain the lack of FET effect. A series of bis-ligand diimine Ni, Cu and Pd complexes have been synthesised from the ligand 4, 5 -bis(dodecyloxy) benzene- 1, 2 -diamine (dbdaH 2). The same ligand was also used to prepare a series of soluble Cu(II) and Ni(II) tetraaza[14]annulene macrocycles. All the bis-ligand diimine complexes were found to suffer from instability in air due to the ease at which the complexes are oxidised. The Ni complex, Ni(dbda) 2, was found to display a NIR transition in the region of 971 to 1024 nm depending on the polarity of the solvent that the molecule is dissolved in. Solution electrochemistry studies of Ni(dbda) 2 reaffirmed the facile nature of the first oxidative process, with the HOMO energy calculated at - 4 eV by hybrid-DFT. This compound failed to yield semiconducting behaviour in an FET device despite the use of surface treatments aimed at promoting suitable molecular alignment across the conducting channel...|$|E
