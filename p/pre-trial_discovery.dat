40|$|Abstract. Online dispute {{resolution}} {{is becoming the}} main method when dealing with a conflict in e-commerce. A family of defeasible reasoning patterns is used to provide a useful link between {{dispute resolution}} agents and legal doctrines. The proposed argumentation framework combines defeasible logic with temporal reasoning and argumentation with level of certainty. The evaluation of arguments depends {{on the stage of}} the dispute: commencement, <b>discovery,</b> <b>pre-trial,</b> arbitration, according to current practice in law. By applying the open world assumption to the rules, the argumentative semantics of defeasible logic is enriched with three types of negated rules which offer symmetrical means of argumentation for both disputants. A corollary of this extension consists in defining a specialized type of undercutting defeater. The theory is illustrated {{with the help of a}} concrete business-to-client case in a partially implemented system. ...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{disclosures}} {{of secret}} U. S. government surveillance programs {{have brought to}} the forefront how intelligence agencies should manage the gathering and analysis of intelligence collected and when {{and how best to}} pass that information on to law enforcement. What is first collected for national security purposes can now potentially be used in a criminal trial. Law enforcement agents are said to utilize “parallel construction” to hide the original source that initiated the criminal investigation and develop their own evidence independent from this original source. Since the “wall” between intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies fell down post- 9 / 11 and intelligence information is now provided to law enforcement, should defendants have the right to review this evidence and are they entitled to this information (e. g. NSA wire intercepts) via discovery obligations? This article explores the constitutionality of “parallel construction,” the relationship between the intelligence community and law enforcement, and whether the non-disclosure of how a criminal investigation was initiated constitutes a violation of a defendant’s right to <b>discovery</b> <b>pre-trial</b> and right to a fair trial. Currently, Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) procedures are in place to protect against the disclosure of classified information {{while at the same time}} ensuring the defendant a right to a fair trial by having the judge in the case review the evidence ex parte and determine whether it should be disclosed to the defendant in redacted form (thereby fulfilling the prosecutor’s discovery obligations). This article argues that the procedures put in place, CIPA and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, adequately protect the defendant’s right to discovery and right to a fair trial, but public concerns as to law enforcement’s use of intelligence information, which bring to the forefront the consequences of intelligence sharing, are well founded and these intelligence sharing regulations should be narrower in scope...|$|R

40|$|This article compares and {{contrasts}} the <b>pre-trial</b> <b>discovery</b> mechanisms used in China and the United States, {{as well as}} {{the advantages}} and disadvantages of each. Although both use similar discovery tools, like requests to inspect evidence and expert examination of the parties, their discovery systems vary greatly. Ultimately, China prefers that judges largely conduct discovery, that the parties mutually select expert witnesses, and that the primary objective is to determine the truth, even at the expense of finality. Conversely, the United States prefers a much more adversarial system, in which the parties collect the evidence, submit motions to the court, and select partisan expert witnesses. Unlike China, the United States also gives substantial weight to finality, prohibiting retrials at the appellate level, but permitting appellate review to ensure substantial justice is achieved. While the Chinese discovery system is efficient and fair, the burden on the Chinese judge to collect evidence is too great and threatens neutrality. To combat this, China should improve the parties’ ability to discover evidence. Conversely, although the U. S. system produces zealous advocacy and extensive information, the parties are plagued by lengthy and expensive discovery procedures.
