The two AC toxins were evaluated for sensitivities to a series of inhibitors of known uptake mechanisms.

The block of target cell intoxication by cytochalasin D could be bypassed when cells were first treated with anthrax AC toxin and then exposed to an acidic medium.

In this study, treatment of skin sections with staphylococcal enterotoxin A or exfoliative toxin but not toxic shock syndrome toxin led to significant depletion of LC. This depletion was inhibited by agents which specifically block the action of GTP binding proteins or their associated kinases (cholera and <b>pertussis</b> <b>toxins</b> and H- 8) as well as those which block protein or RNA synthesis.

Proteins coimmunoprecipitated with the TCR/CD 3 complex in digitonin lysate of a human leukemic T cell line, MOLT 16, were incubated with alpha-[32 P]GTP and irradiated with ultraviolet rays to covalently link the labeled GTP to GTP-binding proteins.

This study was performed to characterize {{the effects of these}} toxins and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) on endosome ion transport, fluid-phase endocytosis (FPE), and endosome trafficking in liver. In control liver, more mature populations of endosomes acidified progressively more slowly, but both toxins and cAMP caused retention of an early endosome acidification profile in maturing endosomes. CTX caused a density shift in endosomes, and all agents increased net FPE at time points from 5 to 60 minutes. By confocal microscopy, fluorescent dextrans first appeared in small vesicles at the hepatocyte sinusoidal membrane and trafficked rapidly to the pericanalicular area, near lysosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Prolonged exposure to these agents caused redistribution of many labeled vesicles to the perinuclear region, colocalized with markers of both early (EEA 1 and transferrin receptor) and late (LAMP 1) endosomes.

J. 279, 323 - 326]. Guanine-nucleotide-binding displacement analysis gave a stoichiometry of 1 G-protein per 12. 5 rhodopsin molecules, the same as in vertebrate rod photoreceptors. Binding was not detected above background in the dark, but was rapidly activated by light. Unlike vertebrate transducin, this G-protein is very temperature-sensitive. GTP binding is maximal at temperatures less than 10 degrees C and is much decreased after several minutes above 18 degrees C. The light-stimulated GTPase rate is maximal around 10 degrees C, above which the loss of binding sites counteracts the increase in hydrolytic rate per site. Earlier studies described light-sensitive G alpha components of 40 and 45 kDa, by ADP-ribosylation in the presence of cholera and <b>pertussis</b> <b>toxins.</b> These are now shown to be very minor components, as the prolonged treatment at elevated temperature required for ADP-ribosylation is sufficient to inactivate the major G alpha totally.

Here, adenylyl cyclase (AC) and the α-subunit of the AC-stimulating G protein (Gαs) {{were identified as}} potential cellular target proteins for BepA by gel-free proteomics. Results of the proteomics screen were evaluated for physical and functional interaction by: (i) a heterologous in vivo coexpression system, where human AC activity was reconstituted under the regulation of Gαs and BepA in Escherichia coli; (ii) in vitro AC assays with membrane-anchored full-length human AC and recombinant BepA and Gαs; (iii) surface plasmon resonance experiments; and (iv) an in vivo fluorescence bimolecular complementation-analysis.

The threshold for the excitation of the GTPase activity in vitro is less than 10 (- 1) mumol. m- 2 of blue light, consistent with participation in the blue low-fluence system identified in the same tissue.
