5|$|The late 1970s and 1980s saw {{a massive}} {{increase}} of AAC-related research, publications, and training {{as well the}} first national and international conferences. The International Society for Alternative and Augmentative Communication (ISAAC) was founded in 1983; its members included clinicians, teachers, rehabilitation engineers, researchers, and AAC users themselves. The organization has since {{played an important role}} in developing the field through its <b>peer-reviewed</b> <b>journal,</b> conferences, national chapters and its focus on AAC in developing countries. AAC became an area of professional specialization; a 1981 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association position paper, for example, recognized AAC as a field of practice for speech-language pathologists. At the same time, AAC users and family members played an increasing prominent role in the development of knowledge of AAC through their writing and presentations, by serving on committees and founding advocacy organizations.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, the Roma Tre University {{conducted}} {{radiocarbon dating}} {{tests on the}} artifact, and it was shown {{to have been made}} between 980 and 1146 AD. The uncalibrated radio-carbon date was 1020 ± 30 BP, calibrated as AD 996–1023 (1σ) and AD 980–1146 (2σ), using INTCAL98. These results were published in the <b>peer-reviewed</b> <b>journal</b> Radiocarbon.

25|$|Sensing the {{presence}} of the deceased may be a cross-cultural phenomenon that is, however, interpreted differently depending on the cultural context in which it occurs.

It was observed that, in contrast to Western interpretations, the widows were not concerned about their sanity and made sense of the experience in religious terms.|$|E
