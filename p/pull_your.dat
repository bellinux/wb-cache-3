500|$|Presley began {{speaking}} to the audience between songs about various different things. During one live performance, he spoke about a movie magazine which said he was [...] "strung out" [...] because of his alleged drug problem, he got angry and said: [...] "Well by God, I'll tell you something, I have never been strung out in my life, except on music [...] [...] [...] If I find the individual who said that about me, I’m going to break your neck, you son-of-a-bitch. I will <b>pull</b> <b>your</b> goddamn tongue out by the roots." ...|$|E
500|$|Williams {{warned the}} Beatles about the {{competition}} they would face by {{playing in the}} same club as the Hurricanes by saying, [...] "You'd better <b>pull</b> <b>your</b> socks up because Rory Storm and the Hurricanes are coming in, {{and you know how}} good they are. They're going to knock you for six." [...] In early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day, alternating with the Beatles. They were appalled at the living conditions the Beatles and other groups like Howie Casey and the Seniors (who were sleeping in one room {{at the back of the}} Kaiserkeller) had to put up with, so they booked into Hamburg's Seamens' Mission.|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Dawn commended {{the album}} for being [...] "full of danceable, likeable tracks, {{and even the}} occasional, successful ballad like 'Until I Get Over You'". The reviewer called the album to be [...] "a refreshing change with its charming lyrics and teen outlook". [...] "AM to PM" [...] was said to hint at [...] "quite a lot of talent", and was praised for its [...] "slick lyrics, a fast pace, and a phat vibe". The reviewer also praised [...] "When You Look at Me", [...] "Get Away", and [...] "Got to Have You". Carmen Meyer of iafrica.com found the [...] "smooth, groovy and refreshing" [...] album to be filled [...] "with light-hearted and catchy tracks, which can be enjoyed either in a club, your car or even when chilling at home." [...] She commented on the album's tracks, which ranged from [...] "melodic and heart-rending ballads to funky dance beats that are bound to keep you moving". Meyer praised the [...] "infectious" [...] "AM to PM", the [...] "exciting" [...] "A Girl Like Me", and [...] "Till I Get Over You", which is [...] "guaranteed to pull at your heartstrings and {{make you want to}} <b>pull</b> <b>your</b> loved ones closer".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{expressed}} mixed {{opinions of}} the game's audio. The D-Pad Destroyer of GamePro said that the [...] "whimsical" [...] background music is [...] "quite enjoyable" [...] and the character sound bites are [...] "varied enough to avoid becoming annoying." [...] Doug Perry of IGN had a more mixed take, saying that the [...] "classic bouncy, xylophone-heavy beat" [...] is [...] "not necessarily great", and that after a few courses, [...] "you either stop hearing it, or the incessant simplicity of it {{makes you want to}} cry or <b>pull</b> <b>your</b> hair out". On the subject of the voice acting, he concluded that there is [...] "nothing really that cute, clever or memorable" [...] in the game, and noted that Crash's voice in the game is extremely similar to that of Luigi from the Mario Kart series. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote that while the music and sound effects [...] "push the game's cartoon theme," [...] the themes were not too [...] "over the top" [...] or incessant. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution passed the music off as [...] "standard kitschy fare" [...] and added that while the sound effects [...] "add to the cartoon quality of the game", some of the character voices were unsatisfactory. Joe Ottoson of Allgame noted that the characters [...] "are all quite vocal", and the music [...] "sets off the whimsical mood nicely".|$|E

2500|$|... "What {{have you}} {{witnessed}} now {{is only the}} beginning of a string of attacks that will continue and become stronger until you <b>pull</b> <b>your</b> forces out of Afghanistan and Iraq. And until you stop your financial and military support to America and Israel." [...] Tanweer argued that the non-Muslims of Britain deserve such attacks because they voted for a government which [...] "continues to oppress our mothers, children, brothers and sisters in Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq and Chechnya" ...|$|E
2500|$|But retired Israeli army Col. Gal Luft, {{a former}} {{commander}} {{in the town of}} Ramallah, said, [...] "Israel is attempting to create a rift between the Lebanese population and Hezbollah supporters by exacting a heavy price from the elite in Beirut. The message is: If you want your air conditioning to work {{and if you want to}} be able to fly to Paris for shopping, you must <b>pull</b> <b>your</b> head out of the sand and take action toward shutting down Hezbollah-land." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before a Corker {{press conference}} in Memphis on October 20, Ford {{approached}} Corker {{in a parking lot}} and confronted his opponent about Iraq in front of local news cameras, pointing out that some of Corker's fellow Republicans are changing their minds on the war and wanting to debate him about the issue. [...] In response, Corker said, [...] "I came to talk about ethics, and I have a press conference. And I think it's a true sign of desperation that you would <b>pull</b> <b>your</b> bus up when I'm having a press conference." [...] Ford replied that he could never find Corker. [...] Corker then walked away to his press conference.|$|E

2500|$|On March 9, {{during a}} segment of Mad Money, Cramer admitted, [...] "OK, I'm a tempting target. Plenty of people come in and give their {{criticism}} on this show. But we're dealing with serious issues here; we need solutions, which I offer almost every night. I don't want ad hominem attacks. Take The New York Times columnist Frank Rich and Jon Stewart; I criticize Obama, so both of them seize on the urban legend that I recommended Bear Stearns the week before it collapsed, when I simply told an e-mailer that the deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe. 'Your money is safe in Bear Stearns,'" [...] Cramer repeated, referring to his own quote during a March 11, 2008 segment of Mad Money. Moreover, Cramer outlined, [...] "But through a clever sound bite, Stewart, and subsequently Rich—neither of whom have bothered {{to listen to the}} context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, I would tell you that the common stock might be worthless, but I would never tell you to <b>pull</b> <b>your</b> money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency. Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear. The fact that I was right rankles me even more." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "When I {{called out}} to you," [...] pursued the unheeding Mrs. Henshaw, [...] "you started and <b>pulled</b> <b>your</b> hat over your eyes and turned away.
