50|$|Following the {{contemporary}} styles of illustration seen in other manuscripts, early copies had mostly fairly small scenes, normally with a <b>patterned</b> <b>background</b> {{rather than a}} landscape or interior setting. In front of this a number of figures were engaged in key historical moments, especially battles, coronations, weddings and important meetings. There might be over 200 such scenes illustrated, often collected together as individual compartments in a full-page miniature with a decorated framework. By the mid-15th century the number of illustrations was fewer, around 50 even in lavish copies, but the miniatures were larger, and now had lovingly detailed landscape or interior backgrounds. Scenes of ceremonial moments, now often including large crowds, had become more popular, though battles retained their place.|$|E

50|$|Consider a five-frame clip of a ball {{moving from}} the bottom left of a field of vision, to the top right.

40|$|This paper details {{experiments}} in which neural network controllers were evolved in simulation that allowed a simple panning camera head to track patterned objects moving against similarly <b>patterned</b> <b>backgrounds</b> in reality.

The minimal simulation with which the motion-tracking controllers were evolved (along {{with the rest of the}} evolutionary machinery) is then described. Experimental results are offered in which an evolved controller was downloaded onto a simple panning camera head and satisfactorily tracked two very differently patterned objects as they moved against similarly <b>patterned</b> <b>backgrounds</b> in a random fashion. 1.

Color appearance with <b>patterned</b> and uniform <b>backgrounds</b> was compared using chromaticities distinguished by only the S cones; all backgrounds were equivalent to equal-energy white in terms of L-cone and M-cone stimulation. The measurements showed larger shifts in color appearance with a <b>patterned</b> chromatic <b>background</b> than with a uniform background at any chromaticity within the pattern. The measurements also showed that inducing light within different spatial regions could cause opposite shifts in color appearance: inducing light near a test field shifted appearance toward the inducing chromaticity (assimilation), while the same light some distance from the test shifted appearance away from the inducing chromaticity (simultaneous contrast). The shifts in color appearance were accounted for by a neural receptive field with S-cone spatial antagonism...|$|R

50|$|The cloth is a woven {{using the}} {{tapestry}} technique. It is 218 cm high and 211 cm wide, showing a Byzantine emperor on a <b>patterned</b> <b>background.</b> He is riding {{on a white}} horse, wears a Byzantine-style imperial crown, and carries a miniature labarum on his right hand. The emperor is flanked by two Tyche figures, female personifications of a city's fortune. They are crowned with mural crowns and dressed in ankle-long yellow undergarments and coloured transparent over-tunics. The Tyche on the right, with a green over-tunic, presents the emperor probably with a crown, while the left one, dressed in blue, holds the toupha, a headgear reserved exclusively for triumphs. Both figures are represented barefoot, a symbolic convention typical of slaves, signifying their submission to the emperor, or to represent their divinity as the goddess of fortune.|$|E
5000|$|In 1891, Mary Cassatt {{created the}} oil {{painting}} with two subjects, a mother figure {{and a young}} child. The genre scene {{is based on the}} everyday bathing of a child, a moment that is [...] "special by not being special". The female figure holds up the child firmly and protectively with her left hand while the other hand carefully washes the child’s feet. The small and chubby left arm of the child braces against the mother’s thigh, while the other hand is clamped firmly on the child’s own thigh. The mother’s right hand presses firmly but still gently on the foot in the basin, mimicking the child’s own pressure on her thigh. To indicate depth, Cassatt painted the faces to recede into space. The paint strokes are layered and rough, creating thick lines that outline the figures and stand them out from the <b>patterned</b> <b>background.</b> The hand of the artist is evident through the roughness of the strokes and can be better viewed from a distance.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} for extracting silhouettes by using a particular pattern that we call the random pattern. The volume intersection method reconstructs the shapes of 3 D objects from their silhouettes obtained with multiple cameras. With the method, if {{some parts of the}} silhouettes are missed, the corresponding parts of the reconstructed shapes are also missed. When colors of the objects and the backgrounds are similar, many parts of the silhouettes are missed. We adopt random <b>pattern</b> <b>backgrounds</b> to extract correct silhouettes. The random pattern has many small re-gions with randomly-selected colors. By using the random <b>pattern</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> we can keep the rate of missing parts below a specied percentage, even for objects of unknown color. To rene the silhouettes, we detect and ll in the miss-ing parts by integrating multiple images. From the images captured by multiple cameras used to observe the object, the object’s colors can be estimated. The missing parts can be detected by comparing the object’s color with its corre-sponding background’s color. In our experiments, we con-rmed that this method effectively extracts silhouettes and reconstructs 3 D shapes. 1...|$|R

40|$|Viewed through depth-reversing spectacles, nontransparent objects {{appear to}} cut `gaps' into a <b>patterned</b> <b>background.</b> In moving objects this gap {{is seen to}} extend beyond the {{occluded}} area (`delayed stereopsis illusion', DSI) : Its trailing border appears to lag behind by a precisely measurable distance, indicating a processing time of approximately 0. 13 s to accomplish stereopsis [cf Morgan and Castet, 1995 Nature (London) 378 380 [...] 383]. Other than in thigmaesthesia, there is no correction by antedating. Why is this delay not perceived in normal stereopsis? If an object is moving before some background, the background usually maintains its position; it may be occluded, or not. Depth information thus might be extrapolated to the continuously uncovered regions of the <b>patterned</b> <b>background.</b> Depth reversal demands that the occluded region of the background must jump behind the moving, occluding object. As this object is perceived to retain its distance, the background, as it is getting uncovered, must jump back into the foreground, {{where it can be}} perceived only after renewed calculation of binocular depth. The dependence of DSI on eye movements, disparity, velocity, motion direction, surface texture, illuminance, spatial frequency, and fractal dimension of the objects involved is currently being investigated in model systems which allow us to determine processing times of human stereopsis under well-defined conditions...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} camouflage design, {{we compared}} the responses of two species of cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis and Sepia pharaonis) with controlled but naturalistic backgrounds, consisting of mixtures of 1 -mm and 9 -mm diameter coloured pebbles.

Whereas S. officinalis switches from background resemblance to a disruptive pattern as it moves from a fine to a coarsely <b>patterned</b> <b>background</b> particle, S. pharaonis blends {{the two types of}} pattern. We suggest that the differences may arise because S. pharaonis needs to produce camouflage that is effective when viewed over a relatively wide range of distances...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPhysiological {{alterations}} in cortical neurons are induced during adaptation to an artificial scotoma, a small homogeneous patch within a dynamic random noise or <b>patterned</b> <b>background.</b> When the dynamic noise {{is replaced by}} an equiluminant gray background, a twinkling aftereffect {{can be seen in}} the location of the artificial scotoma. Following binocular adaptation, we discovered that the perceived size of the twinkling aftereffect was dramatically smaller than the inducing artificial scotoma. Dichoptic adaptation induced shrinkage in the twinkling aftereffect that was similar to that found after binocular adaptation, suggesting that the twinkling aftereffect and its shrinkage both have cortical origins. We speculate that this perceptual shrinkage may reflect the interaction between two cortical mechanisms: a twinkling aftereffect mechanism that spreads throughout the artificial scotoma, and a filling-in mechanism that has a greater influence at the edges of the artificial scotoma and spreads inwards...|$|E
