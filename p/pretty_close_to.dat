He was educated at Hawthorn Grammar School and played his early cricket for Kew Cricket Club. Encouraging his sons' early love of cricket, William Trumble—a keen cricketer who bowled leg breaks for South Melbourne Cricket Club—set out a cricket pitch at the family home. He placed a feather on a good length and urged his sons to aim at it when bowling.

500|$|In {{her essay}} [...] "Thoroughly Post-Victorian, Pre-Modern Beatrix" [...] {{professor}} of English Katherine Chandler {{points out that}} Potter, unlike most Victorian writers of children's books, wrote original stories based on the realism of animal behaviour. Chandler notes that Potter avoids moralizing in her tales, making Miss Moppet {{nothing more than a}} story describing the natural behaviour of kittens. Potter's anthropomorphized animals are in fact slightly naughty, yet in their naughtiness the punishment is never the moral of the tale. At the end of Miss Moppet, the kitten is not punished and the mouse dances on the cupboard. This leads Chandler to quote literary scholar of modernism Humphrey Carpenter, [...] "there is nothing in [...] work that resembles the moral tale. In fact if might be argued that she is writing something <b>pretty</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> a series of immoral tales". In addition Chandler notes that Potter's economic use of prose presages modernism, comparing her writing to that of Ernest Hemingway.|$|E

[...] Wilson {{said that before}} its final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by unnamed members of the group. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's {{not going to be}} too long a record, it's going to be just right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece." [...] Love was worried that the [...] "track itself was already so avant-garde, especially with the theremin, [...] I wondered how our fans were going to relate to it."

Benioff concluded, [...] "If you're one of the lords of Westeros or one of her potential opponents in the wars to come and you get word of what happened here in Meereen, you have to be pretty nervous because this is an unprecedented threat. You've got a woman who has somehow formed an alliance where she has a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, she's got the mercenary army of the Second Sons, and she has three dragons who are now <b>pretty</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> full grown.

The names of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the manga, consist of a form of punning in which phrases written in kanji are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of Luffy, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, and Franky's techniques are often mixed with other languages, and the names of several of Zoro's sword techniques are designed as jokes; some of them look fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro's signature move is Onigiri, which is rendered as demon's cut but may also mean rice ball. Eisaku Inoue, the animation director, has said that the creators did not use these kanji readings in the anime since they [...] "might have cut down the laughs by about half". Nevertheless, Konosuke Uda, the director, said that he believes that the creators [...] "made the anime <b>pretty</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the manga".|$|E
500|$|In a July 1966 {{advertisement}} for Pet Sounds in Billboard magazine, the band thanked {{the music industry}} for the sales of their album, and said that [...] "We're moved {{over the fact that}} our Pet Sounds brought on nothing but Good Vibrations." [...] This was the first public hint of the new single. Later in the year, Brian told journalist Tom Nolan that the new Beach Boys single was [...] "about a guy who picks up good vibrations from a girl" [...] {{and that it would be}} a [...] "monster". He then suggested: [...] "It's still sticking <b>pretty</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> that same boy-girl thing, you know, but with a difference. And it's a start, it's definitely a start." [...] Derek Taylor, who had recently been engaged as the band's publicist, is credited for coining the term a [...] "pocket symphony" [...] to describe the song. In a press release for the single, he stated: [...] "Wilson's instinctive talents for mixing sounds could most nearly equate to those of the old painters whose special secret was in the blending of their oils. And what is most amazing about all outstanding creative artists is that they are using only those basic materials which are freely available to everyone else." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{moment in}} the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict {{between him and his}} father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a [...] "... callback to ..." [...] in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow. Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, [...] "... learned {{a little bit more about}} what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's <b>pretty</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has." [...] The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer. Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow. John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.|$|E

2500|$|After its {{instrumental}} linking passage, the key ascends to {{its fourth}} interval. According to author Jim Fusilli: [...] "Brian came <b>pretty</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> writing {{himself into a}} dead end. There's really nowhere to go {{coming out of the}} bridge, which modulates to G major from D major but ends with a D major–A major–B minor pattern. Thus, when the song returns to D Major, it must do so from B minor, which is kind of a static change, particularly when the next chord is a B minor with only a slight variation in the bass." [...] Along with the 8+4 measure verse/chorus scheme, Downes called the idea of a [...] "bridge section in a related key" [...] standard for rock/pop music, but adds: [...] "What is different here, however, is how the move to the subdominant in the bridge conditions the tonal behavior of the entire song, which, though nominally in E Major, is characterized throughout by a tension between it and A major." [...] The [...] "choral fantasy" [...] during this key change eventually concludes that [...] "a clear sense has eluded us for the entire experience–that in fact, the idea of 'key' has itself been challenged and subverted", in Lambert's opinion.|$|E

Her mother is a descendant of Republican state senator Isaiah Rose, whose life story was discussed on Clarkson's episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, in 2013. Clarkson was raised Southern Baptist.

2500|$|Early in 1977, Terry Nation was {{commissioned}} to write four more episodes for Series One and five episodes for Series Two. Nation was now contracted to write all thirteen episodes {{of the first}} series. The BBC had expanded Nation's writing commitment in order that Nation's high profile would help {{the promotion of the}} series. Providing a large amount of material in a short time would prove difficult for Nation. Admitting that he had agreed to write every episode out of [...] "ego and supreme confidence", Nation later recalled that he returned home following the commission and told his wife, [...] "I think I've got myself into deep trouble!". Nation informed Boucher that he would only be able to deliver the first draft of each script, telling Boucher, [...] "...you can have rewrites or you can have the next episode: which do you want?”. As a result, while Nation created the plots, Boucher provided a great deal of input into the characters and dialogue. According to Boucher, [...] "Terry came up with the characters, he came up with thirteen good stories, but he didn't come up with the dialogue.

[...] "Our major objective was to contain Montana, and we did a terrible, terrible job of it," [...] added defensive coach Chuck Studley. Even Reggie Roby, who averaged only 39.3 yards per punt and didn't place any of his 6 punts inside the 20, took some responsibility for the loss. [...] "I was trying to kill the ball, and I kicked it bad," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't hit one well. I was scared – scared to make a mistake. It was the worst game of my life, counting high school, college, counting everything." [...] Meanwhile, in the 49ers' locker room, Joe Montana had his own explanation for the win. [...] "As far as my own game, well, I'd have to admit it was <b>pretty</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the best I've ever played. I didn't throw anything I didn't have confidence in.
