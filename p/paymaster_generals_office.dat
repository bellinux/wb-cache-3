40|$|Sketch {{from the}} {{scrapbook}} of Sarah E. E. Mitchell of Lisdillon on the East Coast of Tasmania 1874. Sketch 97 - Taken April 1869 - by Catherine Mitchell. Playing Croquet at Lisdillon {{on the front}} lawn with the post and rail fence put up by father instead of the old pailing fence, nearer the flower border – former people called Shaw lived there but did no good, two young men, used to amuse themselves firing bullets through it & we used to see the holes. They where not E. C. Shaw family. – Our brother Frank W. D. Mitchell in London, England at the <b>Paymaster</b> <b>Generals</b> <b>Office</b> which he gained from 3 with 131 marks to spare, & at the last of three, he was 18 years old, & the others past 20 yrs. The school master at Exeter used to publish in the prospectus, that his pupil got into office, before others. He was 20 yrs in London & about the same in Dublin, Secretary for Congested Districts Board, & went all over Ireland. Retired to England with a good name & “Imperial Service Order” – Well he sent us “Croquet” & afterwards “Lawn Tennis” soon after it came out in England – Kate, Edwin, Amy, Miss F Johnston, Mr Henry Grigg & S. E. E. M are playing. The sketches by Catherine Penwarne (Kate), eldest daughter of John and Catherine Mitchell (of Cornwall, England, who settled at Lisdillon, East Coast Tasmania in 1852) were made between 1860 and 1876, and portray aspects of 19 th Century social and domestic life. Catherine’s sketches were compiled by her sister Sarah. E. E. Mitchell. Derived from her own collection, from those of friends and relations, and from John Ball, Kate's husband, they were compiled sometime between 1928 and 1933. The sketches are mounted in an album, together with: locks of Kate's hair on red silk; a pressed fern arrangement; a coloured photograph of John and Catherine Ball; and coloured views of Buckland Churchyard in 1850, showing the grave of Paul Thomas Mitchell, aged 3 days, and in 1879 showing the grave of Catherine Penwarne Ball. The scrapbook was bequeathed to The Royal Society of Tasmania in 1946. RS 32 /...|$|E

5000|$|As <b>Paymaster</b> <b>General,</b> Primarolo was {{responsible}} for the administration of the Tax Credits system, intended to provide working families with financial support. However, the administration of this system received significant criticism, including allegations that some families were left less well off as a result. In 2003, a Treasury select committee member accused her of [...] "losing control of her department" [...] after it became known that Inland Revenue buildings under Primarolo's purview had been sold to tax-haven companies. This came shortly after she had [...] "insisted ... the Child tax credit scheme was a 'success'", despite Inland Revenue staff walking out in protest against the pressure under which they were placed. She was also responsible for introducing the controversial IR35 tax rules which were designed to tax [...] "disguised employment" [...] at a rate similar to employment. The measure was controversial as it was seen by some as unfair. Primarolo was also the longest serving <b>Paymaster</b> <b>General</b> in the <b>office's</b> 200-year history. [...] Primarolo was named Chairman of the Code of Conduct Group upon its establishment by ECOFIN in March 1998.|$|R
60|$|Washington, June 7, 1864. DEAREST MOTHER--I cannot {{write you}} {{anything}} about the 51st, as I have not heard a word. I felt very much disturbed yesterday afternoon, as Major Hapgood came up from the <b>paymaster</b> <b>general's</b> <b>office,</b> and said that news had arrived that Burnside was killed, and that the 9th Corps had had a terrible slaughter. He said it was believed at the <b>paymaster</b> <b>general's</b> <b>office.</b> Well, I went out to see what reliance there was on it. The rumor soon spread over town, and was believed by many--but as near as I can make it out, it proves {{to be one of}} those unaccountable stories that get started these times. Saturday night we heard that Grant was routed completely, etc. etc.--so that's the way stories fly. I suppose you hear the same big lies there in Brooklyn. Well, the truth is sad enough, without adding anything to it--but Grant is not destroyed yet, but I think is going into Richmond yet, but the cost is terrible. Mother, I have not felt well at all the last week. I had spells of deathly faintness and bad trouble in my head too, and sore throat (quite a little budget, ain't they?) My head was the worst, though I don't know, the faint spells were not very pleasant--but I feel so much better this forenoon I believe it has passed over. There is a very horrible collection in Armory building, (in Armory-square hospital)--about 200 of the worst cases you ever see, and I had been probably too much with them. It is enough to melt the heart of a stone; over one third of them are amputation cases. Well, mother, poor Oscar Cunningham is gone at last. He is the 82d Ohio boy (wounded May 3d, '63). I have written so much of him I suppose you feel as if you almost knew him. I was with him Saturday forenoon and also evening. He was more composed than usual, could not articulate very well. He died about 2 o'clock Sunday morning--very easy they told me. I was not there. It was a blessed relief; his life has been misery for months. The cause of death at last was the system absorbing the pus, the bad matter, instead of discharging it from [the] wound. I believe I told you I was quite blue from the deaths of several of the poor young men I knew well, especially two I had strong hopes of their getting up. Things are going pretty badly with the wounded. They are crowded here in Washington in immense numbers, and all those that come up from the Wilderness and that region, arrived here so neglected, and in such plight, it was awful--(those that were at Fredericksburg and also from Ball Plain). The papers are full of puffs, etc., but the truth is, the largest proportion of worst cases got little or no attention. We receive them here with their wounds full of worms--some all swelled and inflamed. Many of the amputations have to be done over again. One new feature is that many of the poor afflicted young men are crazy. Every ward has some in it that are wandering. They have suffered too much, and it is perhaps a privilege that they are out of their senses. Mother, it is most too much for a fellow, and I sometimes wish I was out of it--but I suppose it is because I have not felt first rate myself. I am going to write to George to-day, as I see there is a daily mail to White House. O, I must tell you that we get the wounded from our present field near Richmond much better than we did from the Wilderness and Fredericksburg. We get them now from White House. They are put on boats there, and come all the way here, about 160 or 170 miles. White House is only twelve or fifteen miles from the field, and is our present depot and base of supplies. It is very pleasant here to-day, a little cooler than it has been--a good rain shower last evening. The Western reg'ts continue to pour in here, the 100 days men;--may go down to front to guard posts, trains, etc.|$|R
