At a gas station, a boy takes a Polaroid photograph of her which she purchases—the same photograph that John will eventually give to Kyle.|$|E
5|$|More {{offspring}} {{are produced}} than can possibly survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that {{give them an}} advantage over their competitors {{are more likely to}} <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> their traits to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer an advantage.|$|E

50|$|In genetics, genomic {{imprinting}} or other patterns of inheritance {{that are not}} determined by DNA sequence alone can form an epigenetic memory that is <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> to subsequent generations through meiosis. In contrast, somatic genetic memories are <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> by mitosis and limited to the individual, but are not <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> to the offspring. Both processes include similar epigenetic mechanisms, e.g. involving histones and methylation patterns.|$|R

5|$|When mysterious shadow monsters begin {{attacking the}} SSS, Takamatsu gets devoured by one, only to {{reappear}} as an NPC. Otonashi reasons {{with the other}} SSS members {{and many of them}} agree to <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> in lieu of becoming an NPC, including the rest of Girls Dead Monster, Chaa of the Guild, and several unnamed members. Yuri destroys the computers responsible for the shadow program, which was programmed to activate when love was detected in the world, to prevent it from becoming a true paradise and maintain its limbo state. Those who are left—Otonashi, Yuri, Kanade, Hinata and Naoi—hold a graduation ceremony where they thank each other for their support. After Naoi, Yuri and Hinata <b>pass</b> <b>on,</b> Otonashi learns that Kanade's regret was not being able to thank him for the heart she received from Otonashi after his death. Otonashi is heartbroken after she thanks him and passes on, as he has fallen in love with her. In the epilogue, two people resembling Otonashi and Kanade meet each other on the street in the real world. In an alternative epilogue, Otonashi is shown to have stayed behind in the afterlife to help people <b>pass</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although its {{population}} had dropped below a thousand {{by the late}} 1920s, in 1927 the state replaced the stage road with what eventually became Highway 82. Unlike the stage road, it was closed during the winter months. While most of the old route {{was used for the}} new road, a portion of the original grade remains three miles below the <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> the east side. It includes the foundation of the gatekeeper's house and the remains of the gate.|$|E
5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, not that {{the statute of limitations}} would not begin to run. Because the Court of Appeals had only held that the statute of limitation did not apply, not that it would not bar the claim if it applied, and the District Court had held the claim barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E

5|$|At 5a.m., Croatian special police {{advanced}} to the Mali Alan <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> the Velebit, encountering strong resistance from the ARSK Lika Corps' 4th Light Brigade and elements of the 9th Motorized Brigade. The pass was captured at 1p.m., and Sveti Rok village was captured at about 5p.m. The special police advanced further beyond Mali Alan, meeting more resistance at 9p.m. and then bivouacking until 5a.m. The ARSK 9th Motorized Brigade withdrew to Udbina after being forced out of its positions on the Velebit. In the morning, the special police captured Lovinac, Gračac and Medak.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, the Hokies' defense began to stiffen. Aided by a 10-yard holding penalty against the Eagles, Matt Ryan was forced to complete a 14-yard <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> 4th-and-9 to earn a first down and keep the drive alive. Three incomplete passes followed, however, and the Eagles again settled for a field goal attempt. This time, the 37-yard kick sailed through the uprights, giving Boston College a 100 lead with 11:20 remaining in the first half.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{production}} of sex cells, DNA is [...] "reshuffled" [...] {{to ensure that the}} next generation does not inherit, for example, grandpa's chromosome 8, but a mixture of DNA from each parent. Instead, paired chromosomes exchange parallel pieces of DNA, a process called chromosomal crossover, prior to being <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> to the next generation. When particular genes are located physically close together on a chromosome, they tend to be <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> together. The rate at which two genes are <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> together can be used to calculate their distance from each other on the chromosome. Genes which tend to be <b>passed</b> <b>on</b> as a group form what is called a [...] "linkage group." ...|$|R
5|$|Before {{developing}} the route west of Aspen, the state turned its attention the other way. In 1927 it rebuilt the old stage road over Independence Pass to Twin Lakes and designated {{it part of}} Highway 82, closing it in winters to avoid the maintenance costs. Most of it followed the original route; however in some places it deviated. The largest section of the original remains three miles (5km) below the <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> the east approach. The foundation of the gatekeeper's house remains, {{as well as some}} of the original toll gate.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the opening}} of the Barlow Road, pioneers {{traveling}} by land from the east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous and expensive journey. It was also possible to drive livestock over Lolo <b>Pass</b> <b>on</b> the north side of Mount Hood, but that trail was too rugged for vehicles and unsuitable for wagons.|$|E
5|$|Building {{upon the}} gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} that originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through gametes. No other cells can <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> inherited characters. The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy {{is still a}} major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant Anatomy and Anatomy of Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology texts {{for more than half}} a century.|$|E

5|$|Criticism of the MPC has {{centred on}} its {{predominant}} focus on inflation {{to the detriment}} of growth and employment, although that criticism may have been mitigated by the March 2013 revisions to the committee's remit.

5|$|In 1944, {{even though}} a {{prisoner}} of war, Hinton was contacted by the International Red Cross to <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> a request from the Labour Party.

5|$|In that situation, Levski's {{assistant}} Dimitar Obshti robbed an Ottoman postal convoy in the Arabakonak <b>pass</b> <b>on</b> 22 September 1872, without {{approval from}} Levski or {{the leadership of}} the movement. While the robbery was successful and provided IRO with 125,000 groschen, Obshti and the other perpetrators were soon arrested. The preliminary investigation and trial revealed the revolutionary organisation's size and its close relations with BRCC. Obshti and other prisoners made a full confession and revealed Levski's leading role.|$|E
