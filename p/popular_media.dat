5|$|A {{recurring}} {{horror story}} on many websites and <b>popular</b> <b>media</b> outlets is that Japanese soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war. The victim was supposedly tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot.

Possibility of this method was tested on an episode of MythBusters, and confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 (formally {{designated}} D/1993F2) was a comet {{that broke}} apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects. This generated {{a large amount}} of coverage in the <b>popular</b> <b>media,</b> and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its possible role in reducing space debris in the inner Solar System.|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis {{seeks to}} examine how {{teachers}} in the subject Religion and ethics in public secondary school in Norway, use <b>popular</b> culture <b>media</b> in the classroom. A quantitative research methodology has been used where an Internet based questionnaire sent out to gain insight into how <b>popular</b> culture <b>media</b> is used in religious education. The specific <b>popular</b> culture <b>media</b> that is {{examined in this study}} is music, documentary, film, TV-series, cartoons and games. The theoretical basis for this study is theories on religion and popular culture, Hjarvard’s theory on mediatization of religion, Gilhus’ spatial model of religion, and theoretical concepts from the didactics of religion. The sample for this project is 23 teachers from secondary schools in Hordaland and Rogaland. The respondents were asked what <b>popular</b> culture <b>media</b> they used, and for what purpose it was used, in religious education. The data material shows a wide variety of <b>popular</b> culture <b>media</b> being used by the teachers. They also report a variety of reasons to why the specific <b>popular</b> culture <b>media</b> are used in the classroom. The analysis has used the categories partly given by the respondents, and discussed these against some of the theoretical perspectives of this thesis. According to the respondents, some of the functions of <b>popular</b> culture <b>media</b> in the classroom are {{to be used as a}} point for discussion and reflection, to make the classes more varied and or repetition, to show examples and illuminate certain themes, for analysis of texts (for music only), and finally, to show an inside perspective from within a religion...|$|R

50|$|Pulp {{novels in}} the 1950s were mass-produced to {{specifically}} {{cash in on}} the growing fear of youth that was spreading throughout society.

5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the <b>popular</b> <b>media</b> are unable to report on activities that the government may be trying to hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe {{attempted}} {{to ensure that}} Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the <b>popular</b> <b>media</b> tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame. Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton's unpredictable moods, and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world. Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for {{his experience as a}} marine biologist, and Barton for his mechanical skill. Out of pragmatic concern for the success of their dives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island, although they did not remain on good terms afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most effective}} and <b>popular</b> <b>media</b> of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E

5|$|Western astrology {{is founded}} on the {{movements}} and relative positions of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon and planets, which are analysed by their movement through signs of the zodiac (twelve spatial divisions of the ecliptic) and by their aspects (based on geometric angles) relative to one another. They are also considered by their placement in houses (twelve spatial divisions of the sky). Astrology's modern representation in western <b>popular</b> <b>media</b> is usually reduced to sun sign astrology, which considers only the zodiac sign of the Sun at an individual's date of birth, and represents only 1/12 of the total chart.|$|E
5|$|In his 1880 {{article about}} extinct cats, Cope also named a third species of Smilodon, S.gracilis. The species {{was based on}} a partial canine, which had been {{obtained}} in a cave near the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania. Cope found the canine to be distinct from that of the other Smilodon species due to its smaller size and more compressed base. Its specific name refers to the species' lighter build. This species is known from fewer and less complete remains than {{the other members of the}} genus. S.gracilis has at times been considered part of genera such as Megantereon and Ischyrosmilus. S.populator, S.fatalis and S.gracilis are currently considered the only valid species of Smilodon, and features used to define most of their junior synonyms have been dismissed as variation between individuals of the same species (intraspecific variation). One of the most famous of prehistoric mammals, Smilodon has often been featured in <b>popular</b> <b>media</b> and is the state fossil of California.|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2014. Major: Communication Studies. Advisor: Mary Douglas Vavrus. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iv, 259 pages. In this dissertation, I examine how CAM is discursively constructed in four major biomedical journals, The Journal of the American Medical Association, Nature, Science, and The New England Journal of Medicine, and three widely known women's <b>popular</b> health <b>media</b> sites, The Dr. Oz Show, Women's Health magazine, and Prevention magazine, {{and argue that}} risk is a major trope {{in the construction of}} CAM. In my analysis, I found that medical journals use risk discursively to circumscribe the extent to which CAM is accepted in the mainstream medical community and to reinforce institutional boundaries. In women's <b>popular</b> health <b>media,</b> I found that risk is used discursively to reinforce the importance of conventional beauty standards while also supporting CAM as a valid supplement to conventional medicine by emphasizing how using CAM may enhance or improve health. Finally, I argue that although medical journals use the risk of CAM to validate professional norms, and women's health media conflate health and appearance using CAM, women's <b>popular</b> health <b>media</b> also provide specific examples of resistance against both the construction of the riskiness of CAM by medical journals and the patriarchal discourses that inflect the <b>popular</b> <b>media's</b> coverage of CAM...|$|R
