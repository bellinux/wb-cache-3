5|$|Rowling {{found it}} {{difficult}} to finish Harry <b>Potter</b> <b>and</b> the Chamber of Secrets because she was afraid it would not live up to the expectations raised by Harry <b>Potter</b> <b>and</b> the Philosopher's Stone (Harry <b>Potter</b> <b>and</b> the Sorcerer's Stone in the US). After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.|$|E

5|$|A {{year later}} Radcliffe starred in Harry <b>Potter</b> <b>and</b> the Chamber of Secrets, the second {{installment}} of the series. Reviewers were positive about the lead actors' performances but had polarised opinions on the movie as a whole. The 2004 release Harry <b>Potter</b> <b>and</b> the Prisoner of Azkaban was the third film in the series. Radcliffe's performance was panned by New York Times journalist A. O. Scott, who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance. Next was Harry <b>Potter</b> <b>and</b> the Goblet of Fire in 2005. The film was the second-highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point, and Radcliffe singled out the humour as being {{a reason for the}} movie's creative success.|$|E
