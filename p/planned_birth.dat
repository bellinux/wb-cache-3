40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare mode {{of birth}} and medical {{interventions}} between broadly equivalent birth settings in England and the Netherlands. METHODS: Data were combined from the Birthplace study in England (from April 2008 to April 2010) and the National Perinatal Register in the Netherlands (2009). Low risk women in England <b>planning</b> <b>birth</b> at home (16, 470) or in freestanding midwifery units (11, 133) were compared with Dutch women with <b>planned</b> home <b>births</b> (40, 468). Low risk English women with <b>births</b> <b>planned</b> in alongside midwifery units (16, 418) or obstetric units (19, 096) were compared with Dutch women with <b>planned</b> midwife-led hospital <b>births</b> (37, 887). RESULTS: CS rates varied across <b>planned</b> <b>births</b> settings from 6. 5 % to 15. 5 % among nulliparous and 0. 6 % to 5. 1 % among multiparous women. CS rates were higher among low risk nulliparous and multiparous English women <b>planning</b> obstetric unit <b>births</b> compared to Dutch women <b>planning</b> midwife-led hospital <b>births</b> (adjusted (adj) OR 1. 89 (95 % CI 1. 64 to 2. 18) and 3. 66 (2. 90 to 4. 63) respectively). Instrumental vaginal birth rates varied from 10. 7 % to 22. 5 % for nulliparous and from 0. 9 % to 5. 7 % for multiparous women. Rates were lower in the English comparison groups apart from <b>planned</b> <b>births</b> in obstetric units. Transfer, augmentation and episiotomy rates were much lower in England compared to the Netherlands for all midwife-led groups. In most comparisons, epidural rates were higher among English groups. CONCLUSIONS: When considering maternal outcomes, findings confirm advantages of giving birth in midwife-led settings for low risk women. Further research is needed into strategies to decrease rates of medical intervention in obstetric units in England and to reduce rates of avoidable transfer, episiotomy and augmentation of labour in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} {{the relationship between}} maternal age and intrapartum outcomes in 'low-risk' women; and to evaluate whether the relationship between maternal age and intrapartum interventions and adverse outcomes differs by <b>planned</b> place of <b>birth.</b> Prospective cohort study. Obstetric units (OUs), midwifery units and <b>planned</b> home <b>births</b> in England. 63 371 women aged over 16 without known medical or obstetric risk factors, with singleton pregnancies, <b>planning</b> vaginal <b>birth.</b> Log Poisson regression {{was used to evaluate}} the association between maternal age, modelled as a continuous and categorical variable, and risk of intrapartum interventions and adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. Intrapartum caesarean section, instrumental delivery, syntocinon augmentation and a composite measure of maternal interventions/adverse outcomes requiring obstetric care encompassing augmentation, instrumental delivery, intrapartum caesarean section, general anaesthesia, blood transfusion, third-degree/fourth-degree tear, maternal admission; adverse perinatal outcome (encompassing neonatal unit admission or perinatal death). Interventions and adverse maternal outcomes requiring obstetric care generally increased with age, particularly in nulliparous women. For nulliparous women aged 16 - 40, the risk of experiencing an intervention or adverse outcome requiring obstetric care increased more steeply with age in <b>planned</b> non-OU <b>births</b> than in <b>planned</b> OU <b>births</b> (adjusted RR 1. 21 per 5 -year increase in age, 95 % CI 1. 18 to 1. 25 vs adjusted RR 1. 12, 95 % CI 1. 10 to 1. 15) but absolute risks were lower in <b>planned</b> non-OU <b>births</b> at all ages. The risk of neonatal unit admission or perinatal death was significantly raised in nulliparous women aged 40 + relative to women aged 25 - 29 (adjusted RR 2. 29, 95 % CI 1. 28 to 4. 09). At all ages, 'low-risk' women who <b>plan</b> <b>birth</b> in a non-OU setting tend to experience lower intervention rates than comparable women who <b>plan</b> <b>birth</b> in an OU.

50|$|It {{used to be}} true that China {{had more}} girls {{available}} for adoption, due to the Chinese culture's preference for sons {{in combination with the}} official <b>planned</b> <b>birth</b> policy implemented in 1979. Until the early 2000s, around 90-95% of Chinese children adopted by American families were girls. For numerous reasons, including a recent amendment of the one child policy, the dwindling number of available females for marriage, and an increased prevalence of sex selective abortions, most orphanages in China now house only children with special needs, the majority of which are male. Because of the heavy preference for females in adopting families most waiting children in China are boys, as girls with the same needs are quickly matched with a long line of families seeking Chinese daughters. Although India also has a noticeable excess of girls available for adoption (around 70%), In contrast, South Korea, another East Asian country, has a relatively large excess of boys being adopted; about 60% are boys.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To examine {{differences}} in outcomes between <b>planned</b> home <b>births,</b> occurring {{at home or}} in hospital, and <b>planned</b> hospital <b>births.</b> Design and setting: Population-based study using South Australian perinatal data on all births and perinatal deaths during the period 1991 – 2006. Analysis included logistic regression adjusted for predictor variables and standardised perinatal mortality ratios. Main outcome measures: Perinatal death, intrapartum death, death attributed to intrapartum asphyxia, Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes, use of specialised neonatal care, operative delivery, perineal injury and postpartum haemorrhage. Results: <b>Planned</b> home <b>births</b> accounted for 0. 38 % of 300 011 births in South Australia. They had a perinatal mortality rate similar to that for <b>planned</b> hospital <b>births</b> (7. 9 v 8. 2 per 1000 births), but a sevenfold higher risk of intrapartum death (95 % CI, 1. 53 – 35. 87) and a 27 -fold higher risk of death from intrapartum asphyxia (95 % CI, 8. 02 – 88. 83). Review of perinatal deaths in the <b>planned</b> home <b>births</b> group identified inappropriate inclusion of women with risk factors for home birth and inadequate fetal surveillance during labour. Low Apgar scores were more frequent among <b>planned</b> home <b>births,</b> and use of specialised neonatal care as well as rates of postpartum haemorrhage and severe perineal tears were lower among <b>planned</b> home <b>births,</b> but these differences were not statistically significant. <b>Planned</b> home <b>births</b> had lower caesarean section and instrumental delivery rates, and a seven times lower episiotomy rate than <b>planned</b> hospital <b>births.</b> Conclusions: Perinatal safety of home births may be improved substantially by better adherence to risk assessment, timely transfer to hospital when needed, and closer fetal surveillance.

50|$|As {{a result}} of the rainout versus Baltimore on April 8, starter Colby Lewis pitched one day later than scheduled.

RESULTS: Of the total of 814 979 women, 466 112 had a <b>planned</b> home <b>birth</b> and 276 958 had a <b>planned</b> hospital <b>birth.</b> For 71 909 women, their <b>planned</b> place of <b>birth</b> was unknown. The combined intrapartum and neonatal death rates up to 28 days after birth, including cases with discrepancies in the registration of the moment of death, were: for nulliparous women, 1. 02 ‰ for <b>planned</b> home <b>births</b> versus 1. 09 ‰ for <b>planned</b> hospital <b>births,</b> adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0. 99, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 79 - 1. 24; and for parous women, 0. 59 ‰ versus 0. 58 ‰, aOR 1. 16, 95 % CI 0. 87 - 1. 55. The rates of NICU admissions and low Apgar scores did not significantly differ among nulliparous women (NICU admissions up to 28 days, 3. 41 ‰ versus 3. 61 ‰, aOR 1. 05, 95 % CI 0. 92 - 1. 18). Among parous women the rates of Apgar scores below seven and NICU admissions were significantly lower among <b>planned</b> home <b>births</b> (NICU admissions up to 28 days, 1. 36 versus 1. 95 ‰, aOR 0. 79, 95 % CI 0. 66 - 0. 93). CONCLUSIONS: We found no increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes for <b>planned</b> home <b>births</b> among low-risk women. Our results may only apply to regions where home births are well integrated into the maternity care system. A de Jonge, CC Geerts, BY van der Goes, BW Mol, SE Buitendijk and JG Nijhui...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{estimate}} the cost-effectiveness of a <b>planned</b> <b>birth</b> in a birth centre compared with alternative planned places of birth for low-risk women. In addition, a distinction {{has been made}} between different types of locations and integration profiles of birth centres. Design Economic evaluation based on a prospective cohort study. Setting 21 Dutch birth centres, 46 hospital locations where midwife-led birth was possible and 110 midwifery practices where home birth was possible. Participants 3455 low-risk women {{under the care of}} a community midwife at the start of labour in the Netherlands within the study period 1 July 2013 to 31 December 2013. Main outcome measures Costs and health outcomes of birth for different planned places of birth. Healthcare costs were measured from start of labour until 7 days after birth. The health outcomes were assessed by the Optimality Index-NL 2015 (OI) and a composite adverse outcomes score. Results The total adjusted mean costs for births planned in a birth centre, in a hospital and at home under the care of a community midwife were € 3327, € 3330 and € 2998, respectively. There was no difference between the score on the OI for women who planned to give birth in a birth centre and that of women who planned to give birth in a hospital. Women who planned to give birth at home had better outcomes on the OI (higher score on the OI). Conclusions We found no differences in costs and health outcomes for low-risk women under the care of a community midwife with a <b>planned</b> <b>birth</b> in a birth centre and in a hospital. For nulliparous and multiparous low-risk women, <b>planned</b> <b>birth</b> at home was the most cost-effective option compared with <b>planned</b> <b>birth</b> in a birth centre...|$|E
40|$|Background High quality {{evidence}} on the cost-effectiveness of <b>planned</b> <b>birth</b> in alternative settings (at home, in a midwifery unit or an obstetric unit) has been lacking, and is a priority area for maternity policy. Aim To provide evidence about {{the efficiency of the}} configuration of maternity care in England and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of alternative settings for intrapartum care for ‘low risk’ women, thereby providing guidance for commissioners, clinicians and for pregnant women and their families. Methods A literature review of existing evidence was followed by four stand-alone empirical studies using different methods to determine the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of alternative settings for intrapartum care. Data from the Birthplace in England Programme of Research were analysed to explore whether there are differences in the efficiency of maternity units when they are stratified according to the type and scale of unit. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were used to estimate the short-term cost-effectiveness of different planned settings for birth for ‘low risk’ women and to develop a template for the design of decision-analytic models to estimate life-long cost-effectiveness for the mother and baby dyad. Findings The larger obstetric units (OUs) tended to be more efficient than the smaller OUs. Less than half of free-standing midwifery units (FMUs) were operating at full efficiency. The cost of intrapartum and after birth care, and associated related complications, was less for births planned at home, in a free standing midwifery unit (FMU), or in an alongside midwifery unit (AMU) compared with planned births in an obstetric unit (OU). <b>Planned</b> <b>birth</b> in a FMU or in an AMU compared with an OU will generate incremental cost savings but with uncertainty surrounding the outcomes for the baby. <b>Planned</b> <b>birth</b> in all non-OU settings generated incremental cost savings and improved outcomes for mothers. For ‘low risk’ women having a second or subsequent birth, <b>planned</b> <b>birth</b> at home was found to be the most cost-effective option. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|E
30|$|In our {{analysis}} the index population was standardized {{according to the}} strata of the standard population. The index populations of <b>planned</b> <b>birth</b> centre births and planned hospital births were standardized using the standard populations of planned hospital births, since women’s profiles were similar. The index population of planned home birth was standardized using the standard population of planned home births.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} the intended place of birth (home or hospital) and perinatal outcome in women with low risk pregnancies after controlling for parity and social, medical, and obstetric background. Design: Analysis of prospective data from midwives and their clients. Setting: 54 midwifery practices in the province of Gelderland, Netherlands. Subjects: 97 midwives and 1836 women with low risk pregnancies who had <b>planned</b> to give <b>birth</b> at home or in hospital. Main outcome measure: Perinatal outcome index based on "maximal result with minimal intervention" and incorporating 22 items on childbirth, 9 on the condition of the newborn, and 5 on the mother after the birth. Results: There was no relation between the <b>planned</b> place of <b>birth</b> and perinatal outcome in primiparous women when controlling for a favourable or less favourable background. In multiparous women, perinatal outcome was significantly better for <b>planned</b> home <b>births</b> than for <b>planned</b> hospital <b>births,</b> with or without control for background variables. Conclusions: The outcome of <b>planned</b> home <b>births</b> is at least as good as that of <b>planned</b> hospital <b>births</b> in women at low risk receiving midwifery care in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{perinatal}} outcomes, maternal outcomes, {{and interventions}} in labour by <b>planned</b> place of <b>birth</b> {{at the start}} of care in labour for women with low risk pregnancies. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: England: all NHS trusts providing intrapartum care at home, all freestanding midwifery units, all alongside midwifery units (midwife led units on a hospital site with an obstetric unit), and a stratified random sample of obstetric units. PARTICIPANTS: 64, 538 eligible women with a singleton, term (≥ 37 weeks gestation), and "booked" pregnancy who gave birth between April 2008 and April 2010. Planned caesarean sections and caesarean sections before the onset of labour and unplanned home births were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: A composite primary outcome of perinatal mortality and intrapartum related neonatal morbidities (stillbirth after start of care in labour, early neonatal death, neonatal encephalopathy, meconium aspiration syndrome, brachial plexus injury, fractured humerus, or fractured clavicle) was used to compare outcomes by <b>planned</b> place of <b>birth</b> {{at the start of}} care in labour (at home, freestanding midwifery units, alongside midwifery units, and obstetric units). RESULTS: There were 250 primary outcome events and an overall weighted incidence of 4. 3 per 1000 births (95 % CI 3. 3 to 5. 5). Overall, {{there were no significant differences}} in the adjusted odds of the primary outcome for any of the non-obstetric unit settings compared with obstetric units. For nulliparous women, the odds of the primary outcome were higher for <b>planned</b> home <b>births</b> (adjusted odds ratio 1. 75, 95 % CI 1. 07 to 2. 86) but not for either midwifery unit setting. For multiparous women, there were no significant differences in the incidence of the primary outcome by <b>planned</b> place of <b>birth.</b> Interventions during labour were substantially lower in all non-obstetric unit settings. Transfers from non-obstetric unit settings were more frequent for nulliparous women (36 % to 45 %) than for multiparous women (9 % to 13 %). CONCLUSIONS: The results support a policy of offering healthy women with low risk pregnancies a choice of <b>birth</b> setting. Women <b>planning</b> <b>birth</b> in a midwifery unit and multiparous women <b>planning</b> <b>birth</b> at home experience fewer interventions than those <b>planning</b> <b>birth</b> in an obstetric unit with no impact on perinatal outcomes. For nulliparous women, <b>planned</b> home <b>births</b> also have fewer interventions but have poorer perinatal outcomes...|$|R
