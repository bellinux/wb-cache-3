40|$|Background: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} and review the results of a technique in which reconstruction of the common and <b>profunda</b> femoral <b>arteries</b> is combined with a femoro-femoral crossover graft using the same synthetic graft. A synthetic bifurcated graft (such as the ones used for aortobifemoral reconstruction), in which one limb is cut off, is used, leaving an enlarging patch at the end where the proximal anastomosis will be fashioned. Methods: From January 1972 to January 2000, 6 patients underwent this reconstruction for severe limb ischemia. Patients were followed up in the outpatient clinic every 6 months. Results: No postoperative mortality and no major complications were seen. One patient had a superficial wound infection, which resolved with conservative treatment. Five patients had a patent graft at an average follow-up of 39 months. Conclusions: Using the same synthetic graft allows angioplasty of the common and <b>profunda</b> femoral <b>arteries</b> <b>of</b> the donor side and revascularization of the opposite lower limb, with good short-and long-term results...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Profunda</b> femoris <b>artery</b> is an {{important}} and largest branch <b>of</b> femoral <b>artery.</b> It supplies all the compartments of the thigh {{as well as it}} supply the head and neck of femur and its branches form anastomosis around head of femur.

40|$|Introduction: Injury of femoral vessels is an {{extremely}} rare complication in intertrochanteric femoral fractures. In most cases reported, the vascular lesion involves the superficial femoral artery, whereas in very few cases does it involve the <b>profunda</b> femoris <b>artery.</b> Presentation <b>of</b> case: We report a case of acute bleeding due to laceration of a perforating branch <b>of</b> the <b>profunda</b> femoris <b>artery</b> caused by a sharp fragment of the displaced lesser trochanter in an intertrochanteric femoral fracture; the lesion was treated by transcatheter embolization. Discussion: The arterial injury may be iatrogenic, occurring during intramedullary internal fixation, or less frequently, the injury {{may be due to}} the fracture itself, caused by a sharp bone fragment that damages the <b>profunda</b> femoris <b>artery</b> or one <b>of</b> its perforating branches. Conclusion: We believe that intertrochanteric femoral fractures with avulsed lesser trochanter are at risk for femoral vessel injuries caused by the displaced bone spike, and we advise meticulous clinical and laboratory monitoring pre- and post-operatively to prevent serious complications...|$|R

40|$|Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease (PAOD) is an {{acquired}} inflammatory disease where a peripheral artery becomes occluded {{due to the}} buildup of atherosclerotic plaques. In patients that possess collateral arteries, an occlusion can lead to shear induced outward remodeling, arteriogenesis, of these collaterals, partially restoring blood flow. However, newly remodeled collaterals exhibit reduced functional vasodilation, which may impair normal activity, such as ambulation. To model chronic ischemia and arteriogenesis in collaterals, a femoral artery ligation in a murine hindlimb is commonly performed. Previous efforts by our group involved measurements <b>of</b> collateral <b>artery</b> diameter {{to assess the impact}} of arteriogenesis on functional vasodilation/vascular reactivity; however diameter measurements are not as descriptive as an assessment of flow, and performing particle image velocimetry allows the change in blood flow control to be investigated. Particle image velocimetry was performed in the <b>profunda</b> femoris <b>artery</b> <b>of</b> unoperated murine hindlimbs with 3 µm fluorescent microspheres. Resting and vasodilation measurements were assessed for protocol validation. As expected, muscle stimulation increased flow significantly compared to that assessed at resting, accordingly, all other measured parameters also increased significantly...|$|R

The first variant represented {{a case of}} the posterior circumflex humeral artery run-ning not within the humerotricipital triangle but branching more distally, turning under the tendon of the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles and supplying its usual area around the glenohumeral joint.

This variant is quite rare (1. 25 %) as reported in the only literature source available: Adachi 1928 – 4. 3 %.

40|$|Background: Surgical {{options for}} breast {{reconstruction}} include alloplastic and autogenous reconstructions. In autologous {{cases where the}} abdomen is not a suitable primary donor site, secondary donor sites such as the thigh or buttock are considered. The aim of this report is to describe a novel approach, the combined transverse upper gracilis and <b>profunda</b> <b>artery</b> perforator (TUGPAP) flap, aimed at medium to large volume breast reconstruction, with a single donor site used per breast. Methods: Between January 2011 and June 2013, 32 consecutive unilateral immediate breast reconstruction cases were performed using free flaps. In nine cases, patients had previously undergone abdominal surgery, therefore abdominal flaps were excluded and TUGPAP flaps were performed. The TUGPAP flap consisted of the combination of two well-described flaps: the transverse upper gracilis (TUG) and the <b>profunda</b> <b>artery</b> perforator (PAP) flap. All TUGPAP flaps were based on two pedicles: the ascending branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery (MCFA) for the TUG component, and the <b>profunda</b> <b>artery</b> perforator itself for the PAP component. Results: The mean size of the harvested skin paddle was 28. 6 × 8 cm 2 (range, 27 × 7 cm 2 to 30 × 9 cm 2). The average length of the TUG flap pedicle was 7 cm (range, 6 – 8 cm) and the PAP flap pedicle was 9 cm (range, 8. 5 – 10 cm). The flap survival rate was 100 % with no re-exploration, and no partial flap loss. Post-operatively there was one case of persistent donor site seroma, which was managed conservatively. Conclusion: With appropriate patient selection and surgical technique the TUGPAP flap could be a valuable option as an alternative method for autologous breast reconstruction. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Although {{the lateral}} thigh flap {{has been well}} {{described}} as a fasciocutaneous flap based on {{one or more of}} the four perforators <b>of</b> the <b>profunda</b> femoris <b>artery,</b> the role for these individual perforators as perforator flaps has not been described. These <b>profunda</b> femoris <b>artery</b> perforators offer a particularly useful option in lower-limb reconstruction. In fact, a perforator flap based on the <b>profunda</b> femoris <b>artery</b> fourth perforator (PFA-P 4) has not been described to our knowledge.

RESULTS: Superficial epigastric, superficial circumflex iliac and superficial external pudendal arteries arising from femoral artery as separate branches in 68. 3 % within femoral sheath. The mean distance from the point of origin <b>of</b> all superficial <b>arteries</b> was found within 3. 5 cm and <b>profunda</b> femoris <b>artery</b> was 3. 28 cm from femoral artery. Medial circumflex femoral artery arises frequently from femoral artery by 20 % and lateral circumflex femoral artery was by 15 %.
