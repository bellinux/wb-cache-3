25|$|A new high-horsepower narrow-profile {{engine was}} {{required}} for the Kawasaki Ki-64 experimental fighter. The aircraft design called for a narrow-profile fuselage, and the solution that Kawasaki developed was the Ha-201 engine. Although similar to the Aichi Ha-70, where two Aichi Atsuta engines, mounted side-by-side behind the cockpit driving a single large propeller — an arrangement already used by the Daimler-Benz DB 606 that powered the Heinkel He 119 reconnaissance monoplane prototypes, and later inspired Japan's own Yokosuka R2Y reconnaissance aircraft from the seventh and eighth He 119 prototypes being sold to Japan in May 1940 — for the Japanese Ki-64, its own <b>powerplant</b> <b>installation</b> design called for the two Kawasaki Ha-40 engines to be separately mounted, one in the aircraft's nose, the other behind the cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|Fw 190 A-8: The A-8 entered {{production}} in February 1944, powered {{either by the}} standard BMW 801 D-2 or the 801Q (also known as 801TU). The 801Q/TU, with the [...] "T" [...] signifying a Triebwerksanlage unitized <b>powerplant</b> <b>installation,</b> was a standard 801D with improved, thicker armour on the BMW-designed front annular cowling, which still incorporated the BMW-designed oil cooler, upgraded from 6mm (.24in) on earlier models to 10mm (.39in). Changes introduced in the Fw 190 A-8 also included the C3-injection Erhöhte Notleistung emergency boost system to the fighter variant of the Fw 190 A (a similar system with less power had been fitted to some earlier Jabo variants of the 190 A), raising power to 1,980PS (1,953hp, 1,456kW) for a short time.|$|E
50|$|The Spitfire Mark I was {{a utility}} {{helicopter}} {{built in the}} United States in the late 1970s and intended for series production. In essence, the Mark I was an Enstrom F-28 that was modified to use an Allison 250 turboshaft engine and geared transmission {{in place of the}} original piston engine and system of vee belts. The resulting <b>powerplant</b> <b>installation</b> was lighter and more compact, which allowed for additional cargo or fuel.|$|E
40|$|Results {{from the}} {{application}} of a second generation low-order panel method to a number of <b>powerplant</b> <b>installations</b> are presented. The method, which retains the advantages of ease of use and low operating cost of earlier panel methods while retaining the aerodynamic modelling rigor of higher-order methods was used to predict the flow in and around typical nacelles and aircraft {{for a wide range of}} conditions. The ability of the second generation low-order analysis to calculate internal flows without the leakage problems associated with earlier programs is demonstrated and correlation between calculated and measured surface pressures and flow behavior, including predicting streamlines and locating regions of separated flow, is presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} present methodologies {{used for the}} rapid sizing of a {{vertical}} takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This sizing approach draws heavily from historical designs (both manned and unmanned) and investigates the trends among VTOL aircraft of similar types, using <b>powerplant</b> <b>installations</b> and approaches as means to group aircraft. Once the research aircraft are categorized, pertinent weight data are researched and gathered {{to be used for}} weight trend generation within each vehicle category. Through the use of regression, trends are fitted to the historical data, creating a series of equations that help determine weights for new designs. Weight savings due to technological advancements are also explored, helping to define the weight impacts of an unmanned system. Specific constraints related to VTOL aircraft are then investigated and generated for use on a conventional aircraft design constraint plot, allowing for the user to determine the wing area and powerplant required for the vehicle. An example VTOL vehicle is then sized using the developed methodology. Nomenclatur...|$|R
5000|$|A Riesenflugzeug (plural Riesenflugzeuge, German for [...] "giant aircraft"), {{sometimes}} colloquially {{referred to}} in English as an R-plane, was a large World War I German bomber, possessing at least three aircraft engines, more usually being powered by four or more engines, sometimes {{of more than one}} make, model or power level. These were large multi-engine aircraft capable of flying several hours with larger bomb loads than the smaller Grossflugzeug bombers such as the Gotha G.V. Some of the earliest Riesenflugzeuge were given G-type designations before being redesignated, but a major distinction was that the requirements for the R-type specified that the engines had to be serviceable in flight. As a result, designs fell into two groups - those with the engines mounted centrally inside the fuselage using gearboxes and driveshafts to transfer the power to propellers mounted between the wings, and those with conventional <b>powerplant</b> <b>installations</b> mounted in large nacelles or the nose of the aircraft where engineers would be stationed for each group of engines. The transmission of power from the centrally mounted engines to the remote, most often wing-mounted propellers proved troublesome in practice and most operational examples of Riesenflugzeug-class aircraft were of the second type, as with the all-direct-drive Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI.|$|R
50|$|The Arado SD III was {{a fighter}} biplane {{developed}} in Germany in the 1920s. It {{was developed in}} parallel with the SD II and shared most of that aircraft's airframe design. The main differences were connected with the <b>powerplant</b> <b>installation,</b> which in turn required a shorter forward fuselage and redesigned undercarriage. Evaluated at Staaken, Rechlin and finally at Lipetsk, it was judged unsuitable for mass production, but the lessons learned from it proved invaluable to Arado in designing the Ar 64 and Ar 65.|$|E
5000|$|Production of the He 177A {{was pressed}} on anyway, and in service, with {{deficient}} <b>powerplant</b> <b>installation,</b> engine nacelle internal design and maintenance access issues, it {{was plagued by}} engine failures, overheating and in-flight fires, earning it the nickname [...] "Flaming Coffin" [...] by its own crews. Unlike the British, and Ernst Heinkel's own complaints in November 1938 over what Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring would himself later consider to be [...] "welded-together engines" [...] by August 1942, the Luftwaffe never placed any serious efforts into a separate four-engine version until the 1943-44 timeframe.|$|E

50|$|Since her commissioning, Dauntless was homeported in Miami, Florida, until 1993, {{when she}} was {{decommissioned}} and entered Major Maintenance Availability (MMA) at the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland. After 18 months and at a total cost of $21 million, the ship was completely overhauled from stem to stern. The major renovations included the addition of an engine exhaust stack aft of the pilot house, a complete <b>powerplant</b> overhaul, <b>installation</b> of new navigation and communications systems, and extensive habitability improvements.

The fuselage has been put on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center by Dulles Airport, however, the wings were not attached as of late August 2016. The wings had been stored at the Paul Garber Facility in Silver Hill, Maryland. The repainted wings were displayed during the January 30, 2016 open house in the restoration hangar paint shack. , the completely restored fuselage and tail surfaces, along with the aircraft's partially restored DB 603 engines and nacelles (possibly as Heinkel-designed specific, Kraftei unitized <b>powerplant</b> <b>installations)</b> displayed nearby, can be seen displayed near the museum's Dornier Do 335 and Arado Ar 234, the only surviving examples of each aircraft existing in 21st century aviation museums anywhere, and which were aircraft that accompanied WkNr. 290 202 across the Atlantic over 60 years ago. By August 2014 the wing structure (without control surfaces fitted) had been essentially restored, and was ready for the trip to the NASM's Udvar-Hazy shops within its integral Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar, to join the fuselage and engine nacelles there, with replacement Hirschgeweih VHF-band radar antenna components to be fabricated, based on a preserved example located in Europe and loaned to the NASM for replication, as part of the ongoing restoration process.|$|R

50|$|The Minidoka dam was {{the first}} Reclamation Service project in Idaho, part of the Minidoka Project of dams, {{reservoirs}} and canals. Construction began in 1904 and by 1906 most of the dam's canals and laterals were finished. By 1909, Minidoka Dam's power plant, the first federal power plant in the northwest, was completed. By its completion, {{the total cost of}} the dam was $5.8 million, which exceeded estimates. The Minidoka project brought water into the southeastern areas of Idaho near the cities of Rupert and Burley. The project was successful, as what was once an uninhabited sagebrush desert is now bountiful farmland. The <b>powerplant</b> <b>installation</b> was significant as a precursor of much larger projects on the Columbia River, including Bonneville Dam.|$|E
5000|$|The planned {{armament}} {{consisted of}} guns in remotely operated turrets and in {{positions on the}} sides of the fuselage. Overall, it carried very little armour and few guns as a means of increasing fuel capacity and range.

In order to provide comfort on the proposed long-range missions, the Me 264 featured bunk beds and a small galley complete with hot plates.|$|E

5000|$|All the Do 217E {{variants}} were {{fitted with}} unitized, BMW 801A air-cooled 14-cylinder radial aircraft engine built by BMW. The early E-series variants {{were meant to}} be fitted with a BMW 801B engine design for portside use to employ counter-rotating propellers as a few other multi-engined Luftwaffe aircraft were designed to have (as with the He 177A) but this was never accomplished. The BMW 801 radials were mounted on welded steel tube mountings at the extremities of the wing centre section. The oil coolers were integral to the front lower section of the BMW-designed cowlings, as used in all twin and multi-engined aircraft that used BMW 801 radials for power. The machine had two oil and five fuel tanks to [...] "feed" [...] the engines, and they were protected with rubber and self-sealing coverings. In an emergency, CO2 could be released into the tanks to extinguish fires. The engines had three-blade, light alloy VDM propeller units installed. Flame dampers were also fitted in the form of [...] "fish tail" [...] exhaust pipes. Such a configuration gave a speed of 470 km/h (282 mph) at sea level and 530 km/h (318 mph) at 6700 m. It enabled a service ceiling of 7300 m when fully loaded and 8200 m when lightly loaded. The Do 217's range was a much more impressive 3900 km, (compared with the other German bomber types).The engines and their supporting struts were positioned well forward of the leading edge allowing plenty of room for the undercarriage and other components. In the upper forward part of the nacelle the de-icing tank was located. The undercarriage was the main structure {{in this part of the}} aircraft. Each main unit comprised two oleo legs and a single wheel. It was retracted electrically via the crew in the cockpit.The adoption by the Luftwaffe midway through the war, of a general system of unitized <b>powerplant</b> <b>installations</b> for twin and multi-engined combat aircraft incorporating as many of the engine's auxiliary components (radiator and oil cooler, and all fluid and mechanical connections) into a single, easily interchangeable unitized [...] "bolt-on" [...] package, known as the Kraftei (power-egg) concept, was being widely adopted by the time of the Do 217's initial frontline appearance. The Junkers Jumo 211 was one of the first engines to be unitized as seen on the Ju 88A, with the BMW 801 radial and Daimler-Benz DB 603 following not long afterwards, as both the BMW radial and the DB 603 inline engines were to be used in such a [...] "unitized" [...] format to power the frontline models of the Do 217.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} and experimental study {{is being made}} {{of the role of}} combustion in large vortical structures in the mechanism of unsteady and unstable burning in air-breathing engines. A large body of experimental evidence supports the contention that these periodic fluctuations are themselves generated by the nonsteady flow over the flame holders and other surfaces. The mechanism itself is relatively independent of the acoustic configuration of the <b>powerplant</b> and its <b>installation</b> and hence constitutes the fundamental element of the combustion instability process. Whether or not the mechanism is excited does, however, depend upon the detailed acoustic properties of the combustion chamber and its environment and in many circumstances it is apparent that non-linear acoustics plays an essential role. As a consequence, the program includes detailed analytical studies of linear and non-linear acoustics in combustion configurations as a means of coupling the instability mechanism to a particular environment. The effective separation of the instability process into i) its mechanism and ii) its environment is aimed at eventually providing means of rational scaling of laboratory size experiments...|$|R
50|$|The Spitfire Mark II, later {{given the}} name Tigershark, was a utility {{helicopter}} {{built in the}} United States in the late 1970s and intended for series production. It was a further evolution of the Spitfire Mark I design, a turbine-powered conversion of the Enstrom F-28. Although airframe changes on the Mark I had been minimal, the Mark II had a substantially redesigned fuselage that rearranged the F-28's 2+2 seating to move the pilot's seat forward in the nose by itself and add a bench seat for three passengers abreast behind it. The leftmost seat on the bench could be fitted with dual controls. The fuselage was lengthened, and the <b>powerplant</b> <b>installation</b> (the same Allison 250 used on the Mark I) was mounted well to the rear. The Mark II still used the dynamic components of the F-28, plus some of its airframe.|$|E
5000|$|Engines were {{typically}} delivered from BMW complete in their cowling, {{ready to be}} bolted {{to the front of}} the aircraft or nacelle, since 1942 as Motoranlage (M) and 1944/1945 as Triebwerksanlage (T). The Motoranlage was the original form of the interchangeable Kraftei, or [...] "power-egg", unitized <b>powerplant</b> <b>installation</b> concept used in many German wartime aircraft. It was most often used with twin and multi-engined designs, with some need for external add-ons. The more comprehensive Triebwerksanlage format for unitization consolidated more of the engine's required accessory systems beyond what the earlier Motoranlage concept could, plus some external mountings, such as an integrally complete exhaust system (including a turbocharger, if fitted as part of the design), as a completely interchangeable unit. Both M and T formats were also used with various inline engines, like the Daimler-Benz DB 603 used for both the inline-engined versions of the Do 217 and the enormous Bv 238 flying boat, and the Junkers Jumo 213 powerplants used for later marks of the Ju 88 multirole aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|In April 1939, the RLM asked Junkers for {{a further}} {{development}} of the Ju 90 for military transport purposes. The Ju 90V5 and V6 were the prototypes of this military design. They got a new wing with a straight inner section leading edge, of greater span (19%) and area (11%). The landing gear was strengthened with twin main-wheels and the fins were more rounded, lacking the characteristic horn balance nick of the earlier models. The windows were replaced by 10 small portholes a side. The Ju 90 V5 flew first on 5 December 1939. A special feature of both the V5 and V6 was a powerful boarding ramp in {{the floor of the}} rear section of the fuselage for loading cars and larger cargo freight. This Trapoklappe ramp, when lowered, was powerful enough to raise the fuselage to the horizontal flying position. Both aircraft were retroactively fitted with the much more powerful, Kraftei (power-egg) unitized mounting 1,200 kW (1,600 hp) BMW 801MA radials, with the first suffix letter [...] "M" [...] signifying the initial Motoranlage format of unitized <b>powerplant</b> <b>installation</b> design promulgated by the RLM.

5000|$|Following the {{untimely}} {{death of the}} top German advocate for strategic bombing, General Walther Wever in early June 1936, the focus of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe bomber forces, the so-named Kampfgeschwader (bomber wings) became the battlefield support of the German Army {{as part of the}} general Blitzkrieg form of warfare, carried out with both medium bombers such as the Heinkel He 111, and Schnellbombers such as the Junkers Ju 88A. General Wever's support of the Ural bomber project before WW II's start dwindled after his passing, with the only aircraft design that could closely match the Allied bomber force's own aircraft - the early November 1937-origin Heinkel He 177A, deployed in its initial form in 1941-42, hampered by a RLM requirement for the He 177A to also perform medium-angle dive bombing, not rescinded until September 1942 - unable to perform either function properly, with a powerplant selection and particular <b>powerplant</b> <b>installation</b> design features on the 30-meter wingspan Greif, that led to endless problems with engine fires. The March 1942-origin, trans-Atlantic ranged Amerika Bomber program sought to ameliorate the lack of a seriously long-ranged bomber for the Luftwaffe, but resulted with only three Messerschmitt-built and a pair of Junkers-built prototypes ever flown, and no operational [...] "heavy bombers" [...] for strategic use for the Third Reich, outside of the roughly one thousand examples of the He 177 that were built.|$|E
