40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{studies of}} male {{migrants}} in India indicate {{that those who}} are infected with HIV are spreading the epidemic from high risk populations in high prevalence areas to populations in low prevalence areas. In this context, migrant men are believed to initiate and have risky sexual behaviors in <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> and not in <b>places</b> <b>of</b> origin. The paucity of information on men's risky sexual behaviors in <b>places</b> <b>of</b> origin limits the decision to initiate HIV prevention interventions among populations in high out-migration areas in India. Methods A cross-sectional behavioral survey was conducted among non-migrants, returned migrants (with a history of migration), and active (current) migrants in rural areas across two districts with high levels of male out-migration: Prakasam district in Andhra Pradesh and Azamgarh district in Uttar Pradesh. Surveys assessed participant demographics, migration status, migration history, and sexual behavior along the migration routes, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> initiation of sex. District-stratified regression models were used to understand the associations between migration and risky sexual behaviors (number of partners, condom use at last sex) and descriptive analyses <b>of</b> migrants' <b>place</b> <b>of</b> sexual initiation and continuation along migration routes. Results The average age at migration of our study sample was 19 years. Adjusted regression analyses revealed that active migrants were {{more likely to engage in}} sex with sex workers in the past 12 months (Prakasam: 15 percent vs. 8 percent; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 3. 4; Azamgarh: 19 percent vs. 7 percent; aOR= 4. 0, 95 % CI 2. 4 - 6. 6) as well as have multiple (3 +) sex partners (Prakasam: 18 percent vs. 9 percent; aOR= 2. 0, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 3. 2; Azamgarh: 28 percent vs. 21 percent; aOR= 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 3. 0) than non-migrants. Contrary to popular belief, a high proportion of active and returned migrants (almost 75 percent of those who had sex) initiated sex at the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> origin before migrating, which is equivalent to the proportion of non-migrants who engaged in sex with sex workers as well as with casual unpaid partners. Moreover, non-migrants were more likely than migrants to engage in unprotected sex. Conclusion Findings of this study document that returned migrants and active migrants have higher sexual risk behaviors than the non-migrants. Most migrants initiate non-marital sex in the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> origin and many continue these behaviors in <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> Migrants’ destination area behaviors are linked to sex with sex workers and they continue to practice such behaviors in the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> origin as well. Unprotected sex in <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> with high HIV prevalence settings poses a risk of transmission from high risk population groups to migrants, and in turn to their married and other sexual partners in <b>places</b> <b>of</b> origin. These findings suggest the need for controlling the spread of HIV among both men and women resulting from unsafe sex in <b>places</b> <b>of</b> origin that have high vulnerability due to the frequent migratory nature of populations. </p...|$|R

However, despite that importance, Colombian immigrant social networks often fragment. What causes this group to do this? Three reasons for this fragmentation are domestic conflict and violence, exported divisions, and stigma and stereotypes. This paper extends the argument that the three reasons posited by scholars, together, are evidence of Historical Trauma. In order to do so it required the interweaving of three disciplinary fields, history, sociology, and psychology to answer the research question. This paper analyses the history of Colombia post 1948, it also looks at the literature on Colombian fragmentation occurring in the Diaspora, and applies the findings to a small case study of Colombian immigrants in the state of Idaho...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{outlines}} of a geographical approach to cross-border mobility, which {{in this article we}} use synonymously with international migration. The approach consists of three constitutive parts that we discern in international migration: people, borders and trajectories. People decide to cross borders or not. In doing so, they can be internationally mobile or immobile, depending on the destination they take into consideration during the decisionmaking process. People follow specific routes to move from one place or region to another, thereby crossing (national) state borders. The approach focuses on whether or not borders act as barriers for opportunities to move. It also pays special attention to the flexibility of the routes and <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> and settlement. These are not fixed but flexible and migrants’ decisionmaking contains aspects of instability, insecurity and volatility affecting their mobility.
