40|$|This {{research}} {{is intended to}} analyze how Ahmadinejad’s <b>political</b> <b>view</b> affects U. S. -Iran relations in 2005 - 2009 and how such a view has been constructed. This {{research is}} also {{based on the idea}} that an individual, in this case is the leader, is the factor distinguishing the results of the foreign policies. U. S. -Iran relation, which was getting better, was worsened under Ahmadinejad’s administration. His political decision is resulted from his <b>political</b> <b>view.</b> Indeed, his <b>political</b> <b>view</b> has something to do with the view framing process. The process of framing Ahmadinejad’s <b>political</b> <b>view</b> is closely related to his life and political experiences...|$|R

Some political parties have used Agar.io in campaign posters {{as a symbol of}} support.|$|E

5|$|However, {{potentially}} severe {{restrictions on}} free speech, {{some of which}} are elaborated upon below, may act as a disincentive to people expressing <b>political</b> <b>views.</b> These restrictions inevitably have a bearing on how representative democracy is upheld, and have also been said to impact the content of free speech as opposition parties are tempered by the fear of defamation suits.|$|E

5|$|Ideologically, Poedjangga Baroe {{supported}} a modern, united nation with one language, Indonesian. However, the different cultural and <b>political</b> <b>views</b> of its contributors led the publication to have undefined leanings. To maintain a neutral political position, the magazine published writings that covered numerous {{aspects of the}} political spectrum. In cultural discourse, the magazine published disagreeing polemics over the proper balance of Westernization and tradition necessary for the country's development.|$|E
5|$|In {{creating}} the game, Rohrer {{was influenced by}} his childhood fear of his house being robbed, numerous publicized shootings, and his own <b>political</b> <b>views</b> regarding gun rights and home invasions. During development and beta testing, the game went through several changes that increased its difficulty. It received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the design and creativity and others finding it hard to empathize with the game's intended message.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{outbreak}} of the First World War the NUWSS spent its time in north Wales organising educational and propaganda campaigns. In south Wales friction was caused by a shift in <b>political</b> <b>views</b> pushed onto the country from the central office. 1912 saw the NUWSS switch its policy as a non-party organisation to set up the Election Fighting Fund (EFF) to support the newly burgeoning Labour Party. Wales had traditionally been a Liberal heartland and the South Wales Federation of Women’s Suffrage Societies was opposed to this new policy. There was a sense that there was a disjoint between the central 'English feminist agenda' pushed by the militant headquarters and the needs of Welsh social, cultural and <b>political</b> <b>views.</b> The strains existed between the two organisation until the EFF was abandoned in 1914.|$|E

5|$|The Electronic Frontier Foundation {{acknowledged}} that the companies were within their legal rights to terminate their contracts with The Daily Stormer, but that the move set a dangerous precedent in which other <b>political</b> <b>views</b> including left-wing ones could be denied legal protection.

5|$|The poem {{contains}} Southey's {{bias against}} superstition, whether Catholic, Protestant, or pagan. He {{believed that the}} work itself was more historical than epic, and it contained many of Southey's <b>political</b> <b>views.</b> Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with many saying that there were beautiful scenes, but many feeling that the language fell short of being adequate for the subject matter. One review went so far to mock Southey's reliance on Welsh and Aztec names.|$|E

5|$|A major crisis {{gripped the}} ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted {{over whether to}} defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal charges that they {{encouraged}} draftees to avoid the draft. The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources {{to the cause of}} the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the <b>political</b> <b>views</b> of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's <b>political</b> <b>views.</b> Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case. After the Kent State shootings in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.|$|E
5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her <b>political</b> <b>views</b> are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E
40|$|Philosophical {{discussion}} {{of human rights}} has long been monopolised by {{what might be called}} the ‘natural-law view’. On this view, human rights are fundamental moral rights which people enjoy solely by virtue of their humanity. In recent years, a number of theorists have started to question the validity of this outlook, advocating instead what they call a ‘political’ view. My aim in this article is to explore the latter view in order to establish whether it constitutes a valuable alternative to the ‘natural-law view’. In particular, I distinguish between three ways in which human rights can be political: in relation to their (1) iudicandum, (2) justification and (3) feasibility constraints. I argue that it makes sense to think of human rights as political in relation to both their iudicandum and their justification but in a way that is not always adequately captured by proponents of the <b>political</b> <b>view.</b> Moreover, I also claim that, if we take the <b>political</b> <b>view</b> seriously, we still need to engage in the sort of abstract moral reasoning that characterises the natural-law approach and which proponents of the <b>political</b> <b>view</b> significantly downplay...|$|R

5|$|By 1910 Russian émigrés met {{regularly}} at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney. Many {{of its members}} were not anarchists, and the club became a meeting and social venue for the Russian émigré diaspora, {{most of whom were}} Jewish. The small group of Latvians who became involved in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists—although anarchist literature was later found among their possessions. Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing <b>political</b> <b>views</b> and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice.|$|E
