25|$|In the United States, {{federal law}} exempts {{low-speed}} electric bicycles from Dept. of Transportation and NHTSA motor vehicle regulations, {{and they are}} regulated under federal law {{in the same manner}} as ordinary bicycles. The Consumer Product Safety Act defines the term low speed electric bicycle as a two- or three-wheeled vehicle with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts (1 horsepower), whose maximum speed on a paved level surface, when powered solely by such a motor while ridden by an operator who weighs 170 pounds, is less than 20mph (15 U.S.C. 2085(b)). At the present time, neither the DOT nor the NHTSA restrict the assembly of e-bikes for use on public roads, although commercially manufactured e-bikes capable of speeds greater than 20mph are considered motor vehicles and thus subject to DOT and NHTSA safety requirements. Consequently, the laws of the individual state and/or local jurisdiction govern the type, motor wattage, and speed capability of e-bikes used on public roadways (see Electric bicycle laws). As long as the bicycle is capable of pedal propulsion, most U.S. states currently do not distinguish between designs that may be self-propelled by the electric motor versus <b>pedal</b> <b>assist</b> designs in which the electric motor assists pedal propulsion by the rider.|$|E

50|$|Some {{electric}} bikes have features {{where the}} motor {{can move the}} bicycle by itself (immediate start) if the rider chooses not to pedal with a button or throttle controller, while others require the rider to pedal at all times (<b>pedal</b> <b>assist).</b> This latter type may in some jurisdictions allow the vehicle to be used on bicycle trails that otherwise prohibit motorized vehicles of any kind (See motorized bicycle).|$|E
50|$|Electric {{bicycles}} are {{not allowed}} in any public area, meaning an area where there is full or partial public access. Any kind of <b>pedal</b> <b>assist,</b> electric bike, scooter, moped or vehicle which has any form of propulsion, whether in full or as assist, other than human power, must be approved as either a car, motorcycle, van, truck, bus or similar. This makes tilt-controlled two-wheel personal vehicles, and pedelecs illegal in all practical ways, as they cannot be registered as a motor cycle.|$|E

50|$|Controllers for {{brushless}} motors: E-bikes require high {{initial torque}} and therefore models that use brushless motors typically have Hall sensor commutation for speed and angle measurement. An electronic controller provides assistance {{as a function}} of the sensor inputs, the vehicle speed and the required force. The controllers generally allow input by means of potentiometer or Hall Effect twist grip (or thumb-operated lever throttle), closed-loop speed control for precise speed regulation, protection logic for over-voltage, over-current and thermal protection. Bikes with a <b>pedal</b> <b>assist</b> function typically have a disc on the crank shaft featuring a ring of magnets coupled with a Hall sensor giving rise to a series of pulses, the frequency of which is proportional to pedaling speed. The controller uses pulse width modulation to regulate the power to the motor. Sometimes support is provided for regenerative braking but infrequent braking and the low mass of bicycles limits recovered energy. An implementation is described in an application note for a 200 W, 24 V Brushless DC (BLDC) motor.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pedal</b> <b>Assisted</b> Bicycles (PAB) {{popularity}} is fast growing {{in urban areas}} due to their low energy consumption and environmental impact. In fact, when electrically moved, they are zero emission vehicles with very low noise emissions as well. These positive characteristics could be even improved by coupling a PAB with a fuel cell based power generation system, so increasing the vehicle autonomy without influencing their emissions and consumption performances. In this paper a conceptual Fuel Cell <b>Pedal</b> <b>Assisted</b> Bicycle (FC-PAB) design with compact metal hydride hydrogen storage is analysed {{by means of a}} mixed experimental and numerical approach. Even though the power source integration for such a vehicle is simpler than that for a car, it still represents a challenging effort maximizing PAB vehicle autonomy and minimizing, at the same time, its weight. The performances of the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) FC based energy production systems for these applications are analysed by means of a simulation model able to describe the performance of all the system components from the on board energy storage to the road load. To increase the significance of the results, comparisons are made with respect to a reference driving cycle, in order to simulate a city trip comprehensive both of flat and hilly parts. Model predictions have proved to be able to simulate system behaviour and could be used to design system characteristics as well as to define its control system. Results show that FC-PAB reaches the pursued targets in terms of weight (comparable with the weight of the same bicycle powered by an electric motor fed by batteries) and autonomy (about 200 km under the conditions defined by reference driving cycle), still being zero local emissions and noiseless...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of Electrically <b>Pedal</b> <b>Assisted</b> Cycles (EPACs), {{bicycles}} {{are becoming more and}} more technologically advanced, and active control systems are being developed to deal both with rideability enhancement and with energy management features. Within this context, this paper investigates the design of the control system for a continuously variable transmission, that allows a fine regulation of the transmission ratio and can thus improve the riding feeling with respect to a standard bicycle gear system. This control system is to be seen as the enabling step to design higher-level control systems that will allow to optimize the rider's effort in an EPAC, by designing a gear shifting policy which achieves the best trade-off between energy consumption and rideability. Experimental results are presented which witness the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) {{recommends}} adults {{participate in}} weekly aerobic activity {{for a minimum}} of 30 minutes moderate intensity exercise 5 days per week or 20 minutes of vigorous activity 3 days per week. The electrically assisted bicycle may help individuals achieve the ACSM’s aerobic recommendations and introduce inactive individuals to physical activity. To compare the physiological requirements of riding a bicycle with electric <b>pedal</b> <b>assist</b> versus non-assist among healthy active young adults. 6 males and 6 females completed two randomized cycling trials using electric <b>pedal</b> <b>assist</b> (PAB) and non-assist (NON). Cycling trials were completed over a 3. 54 km course with varying terrain. Time to completion was faster in the PAB (12. 5 ± 0. 3 min) than the NON (13. 8 ± 0. 3 min, p= 0. 01). Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) was lower in the PAB (12. 0 ± 0. 4) than the NON (14. 8 ± 0. 5, p 3 ̆c 0. 001). There was no difference in mean VO 2 between PAB (2. 3 ± 0. 1 L·min- 1) and NON (2. 5 ± 0. 1 L·min- 1, p= 0. 45). There was no difference in mean power output when comparing PAB (115 ± 11 Watts) to NON (128 ± 11 Watts, p= 0. 38). There was no difference in heart rate between PAB (147 ± 5 bpm) and NON (149 ± 5 bpm, p= 0. 77). Recreationally active younger (college age) individuals may self-select a similar physiological intensity of physical activity regardless of mechanical assistance, resulting in quicker completion of a commuting task with PAB.

40|$|Rapid battery {{exchange}} {{systems were}} built for an electric van and <b>pedal</b> <b>assist</b> electric bike {{as a method}} of eliminating the need to recharge the vehicles batteries in order to increase the feasibility of using electric propulsion {{as a method of}} efficient student transportation. After selecting proper materials {{it was found that the}} systems would need a protective coating to ensure consistent operation. 1020 cold rolled steel samples coated with multiple thicknesses of vinyl resin paint, epoxy resin paint, and powder coating were subjected to environmental wear tests in order to determine if the type and thickness of common protective coatings has an effect on the durability of the system over its lifetime. The tests consisted of a 2400 hour extended salt spray test, coating delamination testing, and modified impact testing. The extended salt spray test, delamination test, and deformation tests of the coatings all found that the type of coating and the thickness of the coating to have a significant effect on the measured outputs. The significant effect shown in the deformation test could not determine the proper material without the aid of microscopic studies of the surface geometry change due to the induced deformation. Powder coating the rapid battery exchange systems would result in proper performance if coupled with epoxy paint for repairs. Testing of the Rapid battery exchange system indicated that the use of mechanical aiming was not suitable for the application, a further adaptation of the system indicated that the system may be better suited toward personal bicycles as there was a large increase in transportation efficiency...|$|E

50|$|The {{vacuum booster}} or vacuum servo {{is used in}} most modern {{hydraulic}} brake systems which contain four wheels. The vacuum booster is attached between the master cylinder and the brake <b>pedal</b> and <b>assists</b> the braking force applied by the driver. These units consist of a hollow housing with a movable rubber diaphragm across the center, creating two chambers. When attached to the intake manifold of the engine or the vacuum pump, the pressure in both chambers of the unit is lowered. The equilibrium created by the low pressure in both chambers keeps the diaphragm from moving until the brake pedal is depressed. A return spring keeps the diaphragm in the starting position until the brake pedal is applied.|$|R
50|$|A pedelec (from pedal {{electric}} cycle) is {{a bicycle}} where the rider's <b>pedalling</b> is <b>assisted</b> {{by a small}} electric motor; thus it {{is a type of}} low-powered e-bike. However, unlike some other types of e-bikes, pedelecs are classified as conventional bicycles in many countries by road authorities rather than as a type of electric moped. Pedelecs include an electronic controller which cuts power to the motor when the rider is not pedalling or when a certain speed - usually 25 km/h - is reached. Pedelecs are useful for people who ride in hilly areas or in strong headwinds. While a pedelec can be any type of bicycle, a pedelec city bike is very common. A conventional bicycle can be converted to a pedelec with the addition of the necessary parts, i.e. motor, battery etc.|$|R

This study investigated three haptic pedal designs, each with high and low intensities of feedback, in a rapid prototyping, paired comparison design. Twenty drivers took part, experiencing the systems in a high-fidelity driving simulator. Results suggested that drivers were best guided towards an “idealized” (most fuel efficient) gas pedal position by force feedback (where a driver feels a step change in gas pedal force) as opposed to stiffness feedback (where a driver feels a changing gas pedal firmness). In either case, high levels of force/stiffness feedback were preferred. Objective performance measures mirrored the subjective results.
