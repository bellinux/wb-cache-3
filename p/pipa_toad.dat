50|$|A {{number of}} {{frogs and toads}} inhabit the islands, {{including}} the well known huge marine or cane toad (Rhinella marina) locally known as the crapaud (pronounced crah-poh) on both islands, and the tiny colourful rare endemic species known as the El Tucuche golden tree frog (Phytotriades auratus) found only in the giant epiphitic bromeliads at the mist-shrouded summits of Trinidad's two highest peaks. The strangest of all Trinidad's frogs is the highly aquatic Suriname toad or <b>pipa</b> <b>toad</b> (Pipa pipa), the tadpoles of which develop in the skin tissue of the mother's back, before bursting out and emerging as miniature replicas of the adult frogs. The giant tree frog (Hypsiboas boans) known locally as the giant flying frog is commonly heard calling after dusk from the vegetation along forest-lined streams in Trinidad. The two frog species of the genus Mannophryne found diurnally active in forests along fast flowing mountain streams (one of which is endemic to Trinidad and the other endemic to Tobago) both demonstrate a degree of parental care as the tadpoles are transported {{on the backs of}} the adult males before a suitable fairly predator-free body of water is found where they may be left to develop. The relatively recently introduced Grenadian 'tink' frog (Eleutherodactylus johnstonei) can be heard at night in loud metallic 'tinking' choruses in urban residential neighbourhood yards and parks from Diego Martin to Sangre Grande in Trinidad, and more recently in southwestern Tobago. The tungara frog or locally called the pung-la-la (Engystomops pustulosus) is commonly heard at night calling from wet grassy ditches in open habitats in both urban and rural areas on both islands and their foam nests are found even in small road and trail side puddles during the rainy season. The southwestern peninsula of Trinidad is home to a rather diverse community of frogs, with at least one (Leptodactylus nesiotus) being known only from that area (an endemic). Trinidad may also be home to a caecilian (Typhlonectes species) (a legless highly aquatic amphibian with an eel-like body that is rarely observed due to its habitat specifications) although only one specimen has ever been scientifically documented from Trinidad.|$|E

50|$|Carvalho's Surinam <b>toad</b> (<b>Pipa</b> carvalhoi) is {{a species}} of frog in the Pipidae family endemic to Brazil. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical dry forests, dry savanna, moist savanna, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, freshwater marshes, ponds, and aquaculture ponds. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|More than 50 {{species of}} mammals have been recorded, {{including}} opossums, bats, tufted capuchin (Sapajus apella), {{common squirrel monkey}} (Saimiri sciureus), Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus), white-faced saki (Pithecia pithecia), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris). The paradoxal frog (Pseudis paradoxa) and the common Suriname <b>toad</b> (<b>Pipa</b> pipa) have adaped to the saline conditions.Reptiles include {{olive ridley sea turtle}} (Lepidochelys olivacea), which nests on the beaches, green iguana (Iguana iguana), spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus) and green anaconda (Eunectes murinus).|$|R
50|$|There are {{records of}} 97 reptile species, {{including}} 35 from the Colubridae family and 26 from the Iguanidae family.Endangered reptiles include Dunn's spinytail lizard (Morunasaurus groi) and Boulenger's least gecko (Sphaerodactylus scapularis).There {{are at least}} 127 amphibian species.Endangered amphibians include the elegant stubfoot toad (Atelopus elegans), El Tambo stubfoot toad (Atelopus longibrachius), Lynch's stubfoot toad (Atelopus lynchi), Costa Rican variable harlequin toad (Atelopus varius), horned marsupial frog (Gastrotheca cornuta), Lemur leaf frog (Hylomantis lemur), Lehmann's poison frog (Oophaga lehmanni), golden poison frog (Phyllobates terribilis) and Myers' Surinam <b>toad</b> (<b>Pipa</b> myersi).|$|R
5000|$|The common Suriname toad or star-fingered <b>toad</b> (<b>Pipa</b> pipa) is {{a species}} of frog in the Pipidae family found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela. In Spanish it is called aparo, rana comun de celdillas, rana tablacha, sapo chinelo, sapo chola, or sapo de celdas. In Portuguese, it is known as sapo pipa due to its shape, as [...] "pipa" [...] means kite. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical swamps, swamps, freshwater marshes, and intermittent freshwater marshes.It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|Some {{amphibians}} brood their eggs. The female salamander Ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii) curls {{around the}} clutch of eggs and massages individual eggs with her pulsating throat. Some aquatic frogs {{such as the}} Surinam <b>toad</b> (<b>Pipa</b> pipa) have pouches in their skin into which the eggs are inserted. Other neotropical frogs in the family Hemiphractidae also have pouches in which the eggs develop, in some species directly into juvenile frogs and in others into tadpoles that are later deposited in small water bodies to continue their development. The male Darwin's frog carries the eggs around in his mouth until metamorphosis, and the female stomach-brooding frog of Australia swallows the eggs, which develop in her stomach.|$|R
500|$|The male Colostethus subpunctatus, a tiny frog, {{protects the}} egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, the male {{transports}} the tadpoles on his back, stuck there by a mucous secretion, to a temporary pool where he dips {{himself into the}} water and the tadpoles drop off. The male midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks. He keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch, he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus spp.) reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings; however, this stage was never observed before the species became extinct. The tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply. The pouched frog (Assa darlingtoni) lays eggs on the ground. When they hatch, the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs. The aquatic Surinam <b>toad</b> (<b>Pipa</b> pipa) raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis. The granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family Dendrobatidae. Its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch, the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water-filled crevice such as the [...] of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad. The female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles.|$|R
