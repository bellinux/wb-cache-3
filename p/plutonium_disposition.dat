50|$|Before {{coming to}} Harvard, Bunn {{served as an}} adviser to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from 1994-1996. Bunn {{directed}} the secret 1995 study on nuclear security from the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). This study served as the basis for Presidential Decision Directive 41 (1995) which established U.S. government policies for securing nuclear materials. From 1992-1996, Bunn held a position as a study director at the National Academy of Sciences. During this time, he directed Management and Disposition of Excess Weapons Plutonium and this study became the foundation for U.S. government policy on <b>plutonium</b> <b>disposition.</b> (The creation of what is now the Office of Materials Disposition was announced the day after the report was released.) Bunn initially suggested and helped coordinate the Nuclear Threat Initiative’s $1.2 million gift to the International Atomic Energy Agency's nuclear security programs, which became the founding gift of the Nuclear Security Fund. He developed the concepts of “cold standby” and “warm standby” for Iran’s centrifuges when various forms of “suspension” of Iran’s program were being discussed and co-authored compromise proposals for resolving the dispute over Iran’s program with former Iranian deputy foreign minister Abbas Maleki. Bunn and his colleague Anthony Wier were the first to suggest a four-year effort to secure nuclear material worldwide, a goal that was ultimately agreed to at the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit. Bunn, Wier, and John Holdren, formerly President Obama’s science advisor, first proposed combining U.S. efforts to convert research reactors and remove HEU into a single program, which became the Global Threat Reduction Initiative.|$|E

40|$|Obtaining strong {{public and}} {{governmental}} {{support for the}} <b>plutonium</b> <b>disposition</b> program and for the projects comprising the selected disposition options will be essential {{to the success of}} the program in meeting non-proliferation goals established as national policy. This paper summarizes issues related to public and governmental support for <b>plutonium</b> <b>disposition.</b> Recommendations are offered which rest on two fundamental assumptions: (1) public and political support derive from public trust and confidence, and (2) despite widespread support for U.

40|$|Glass and {{glass-ceramic}} forms {{developed for}} the immobilization of calcined high-level wastes generated by Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) fuel reprocessing activities have been investigated for ability to immobilize plutonium and to simultaneously incorporate calcined waste as an anti-proliferation barrier. Within the forms investigated, crystallization of host phases result in an increased loading of plutonium {{as well as its}} incorporation into potentially more durable phases than the glass. The host phases were initially formed and characterized with cerium (Ce{sup + 4 }) as a surrogate for plutonium (Pu{sup + 4 }) and samarium as a neutron absorber for criticality control. Verification of the surrogate testing results were then performed replacing cerium with plutonium. All testing was performed with surrogate calcined high-level waste. The results of these tests indicated that a potentially useful host phase, based on zirconia, can be formed either by devitrification or solid state reaction in the glass studied. This phase incorporates plutonium as well as samarium and the calcined waste becomes part of the matrix. Its ease of formation makes it potentially useful in excess <b>plutonium</b> <b>dispositioning.</b> Other durable host phases for plutonium and samarium, including zirconolite and zircon have been formed from zirconia or alumina calcine through cold press-sintering techniques and hot isostatic pressing.

40|$|Significant {{quantities}} of weapons-usable fissile materials [primarily plutonium and {{highly enriched uranium}} (HEU) ] have become surplus to national defense needs both in the United States and Russia. These stocks of fissile materials pose significant dangers to national and international security. The dangers exist {{not only in the}} potential proliferation of nuclear weapons but also in the potential for environmental, safety, and health (ES&H) consequences if surplus fissile materials are not properly managed. The purpose of this report is to provide schedule, cost, and technical information that will be used to support the Record of Process (ROD). Following the screening process, DOE/MD via its national laboratories initiated a more detailed analysis activity to further evaluate each of the ten <b>plutonium</b> <b>disposition</b> alternatives that survived the screening process. Three ``Alternative Teams,`` chartered by DOE and comprised of technical experts from across the DOE national laboratory complex, conducted these analyses.

40|$|As part of {{international}} {{agreement between the}} United States and Russia, {{a significant amount of}} <b>plutonium</b> requires <b>disposition.</b> One of the disposition paths is to immobilize it and dispose of it in a geological repository. The two favored immobilization forms are glass and ceramic. The plutonium, as an oxide, would be reacted with the glass or ceramic to form a homogeneousmaterial. The resulting solid product would then be encased in High-Level Waste (1 -ILW) glass for the can-in-canister option. The HLW glass gives a radiation barrier to increase proliferation resistance. The glass canister would then be disposed of by geological emplacement.

The scenario includes interim storage and processing under IAEA control, and fabrication into MOX fuel in existing or planned facilities in Europe for use in operating reactors in the two home countries. Conceptual studies indicate that existing Westinghouse four-loop designs can safety dispose of 0. 94 MT of plutonium per calendar year. Thus, {{it would be possible}} to consume the expected US excess stockpile of about 50 MT in two to three units of this type, and it is highly likely that a comparable amount of the FSU excess plutonium could be deposed of in a few VVER- 1000 `s.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this analysis/model report (AMR) is to select and/or {{abstract}} conservative degradation models for DOE-(US.

Using these models, the forward reaction rate for the mobilization of radionuclides, as solutes or colloids, away from the waste fondwater interface by contact with repository groundwater can then be calculated. This forward reaction rate generally consists of the dissolution reaction at the surface of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in contact with water, but the degradation models, in some cases, may also include and account for the physical disintegration of the SNF matrix.

40|$|The Department of Energy has {{selected}} immobilization {{for disposal}} in a repository as one approach for disposing of excess plutonium (1). Materials for immobilizing weapons-grade plutonium for repository disposal {{must meet the}} ''spent fuel standard'' by providing a radiation field similar to spent fuel (2). Such a radiation field can be provided by incorporating fission products from high-level waste into the waste form. Experiments were performed to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating high-level waste (HLW) stored at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) into <b>plutonium</b> <b>dispositioning</b> materials to meet the spent fuel standard. A variety of materials and preparation techniques were evaluated based on prior experience developing waste forms for immobilizing HLW. These included crystalline ceramic compositions prepared by conventional sintering and hot isostatic pressing (HIP), and glass formulations prepared by conventional melting. Because plutonium solubility in silicate melts is limited, glass formulations were intentionally devitrified to partition plutonium into crystalline host phases, thereby allowing increased overall plutonium loading. Samarium, added as a representative rare earth neutron absorber, also tended to partition into the plutonium host phases. Because the crystalline plutonium host phases are chemically more inert, the plutonium is more effectively isolated from the environment, and its attractiveness for proliferation is reduced. In the initial phase of evaluating each material and preparation method, cerium {{was used as a}} surrogate for plutonium. For promising materials, additional preparation experiments were performed using plutonium to verify the behavior of cerium as a surrogate. These experiments demonstrated that cerium performed well as a surrogate for plutonium. For the most part, cerium and plutonium partitioned onto the same crystalline phases, and no anomalous changes in oxidation state were observed. The only observed difference in behavior between cerium and plutonium was that plutonium partitioned more completely into the major host phases than cerium. Where cerium was sometimes observed at up to a few atom percent in crystalline or glassy phases, plutonium could not be detected in these phases. The crystalline plutonium host phases identified in this work included zirconolite, cubic zirconia, sphene, and an anorthite-like calcium aluminosilicate. Zirconia has been suggested as a possible material for immobilizing actinides (3), but this appears to be the first synthesis of such a material. Plutonium appears to stabilize the cubic (fluorite) structure through abroad solid solution range. Samarium can also be incorporated into this material, but is not necessary to stabilize the cubic structure. Plutonium leach rates, as measured by the Product Consistency Test (4), were on the order of 10 {sup {minus} 5 } to 10 {sup {minus} 6 } g/m{sup 2 }/day...|$|R
