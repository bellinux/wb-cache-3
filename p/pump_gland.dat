40|$|Abstract]: The {{need for}} this {{research}} project has arisen principally due to the economic cost incurred from poor reliability of a pump group within the Rio Tinto Alcan Gove Alumina refinery. This poor reliability issue concerns the glands on a pump group whose reliable operation {{is critical to the}} success of the business. This research project has identified the root cause of the problem and in turn provided a solution. The Alumina industry relies heavily on slurry pumps to transport liquids and solids throughout the refining process. The failure of these pumps can significantly impact on a refineries ability to produce and consequently the reliability of the equipment is a major focus. Slurry pumps often utilise tradition stuffing box style glands to seal the wet end of the pump from the atmospheric and are usually the first part of a pump to fail. At the Rio Tinto Alcan Gove alumina refinery the mill injection pump group have been experiencing repetitive gland failures which have been costing the operation approx 12, 000 per day. It is these pumps that the project has concentrated on. The critical objectives of this research project include • Identification of the reliability project • Identification of the root cause • Proposal of a solution to mitigate the effect of the root cause. • Implementation of the solution. To achieve these objectives several methodologies have been employed. • Comprehensive review of production and maintenance cost associated with these pumps. • Literary review to examine past works involving <b>pump</b> <b>gland</b> on site and globally. • Detailed failure investigation. • Conducting of an Apollo root cause analysis to identify the root cause and provide the best solution to mitigate it. • Implementation and validation of the solution. With all objectives achieved the completed project has obtained it desired results. Since the solution has been implemented there has been a significant reduction in gland failures with no recorded production losses. The time and capital expedited on this project has returned many times its value...|$|E
40|$|Gland sealing {{has been}} {{researched}} since the 1950 ’s by the British Hydraulic Research Association and others to improve seal performance. The literature review showed the focus had been on uniform packing compression to more closely match the packing pressure distribution to the fluid pressure {{with the objective of}} reducing leakage over time. There was limited work on the tribology of gland sealing and the patents were dominated by seal designs in a liquor environment. The review identified the particle properties of hardness, shape, fracture toughness and size as relevant to the wear and useful life of a gland seal in a slurry environment. This research presents the design, development and testing of a novel laboratory test rig which deliberately injects slurry particles into a typical standard slurry <b>pump</b> <b>gland</b> seal to cause wear of the sacrificial shaft sleeve. Mineral processing relies on slurry pumping to transfer slurry between plant operations and to improve life cycle costs and reliability in the long term a tribology approach was employed for the research. A range of mineral and synthetic particles were selected over the widest possible hardness range, tested and correlated with the output variable (specific wear rate) of the shaft sleeve. The wear of the shaft sleeve was normalised by travel distance and gland follower load. The data was combined by a novel empirical regression wear model which unified the controlling variables of load, travel distance, particle size, hardness, fracture toughness and size. Recent published values of hardness and fracture toughness were included in the analysis. A linear regression model with interactive terms between the fracture toughness, particle size and hardness, including a log term for the size, provided a good fit with statistical significance to the experimental data. Some dependency was demonstrated between the controlling variables of fracture toughness and particle size. Particle shape was found not to be relevant to the model for particle sizes less than 500 microns. A novel particle shape descriptor weighted dihedral angle which described the average dihedral angle of particle vertices, was proposed and this did not provide any more accuracy than existing descriptors such as SPQ. It was discovered during the experiments that slurry particles may form quasi particles in the seal gap depending on the geometric parameters, gap dimension and material parameters of the opposing (packing) surface, in a semi continuous process. A new tribology qualitative model for the wear of the shaft sleeve and motion of the particles in the gap is described. The relevant particle properties have also been combined into a novel dimensionless number (PDN) which was found to provide a significant correlation with the shaft sleeve SWR, and therefore has the potential to {{serve as the basis for}} future research investigation in three body wear.

40|$|The use {{of carbon}} dioxide for neutralising pulp mill black liquor {{residuals}} and controlling paper machine stock pH has increased dramatically over the past decade. It is replacing, or supplementing, alum and sulfuric acid as the chemical of choice {{because it does not}} add any metal or sulfate ions to the water system; an important consideration with the trend to closed loop water systems in paper mills. However, dissolved and entrained gases can create production problems and paper quality faults at the wet end of the paper machine. Pin holes (where there’s a bubble of gas, there no fibre!), drainage loss and poor formation are some of the more noticeable impacts on paper quality, whilst sheet breaks and pump cavitation can create runability problems. Entrained gases in stock systems have historically been due to mechanical inclusion of air in falling stock, leaky <b>pump</b> <b>glands</b> and poor piping design. Air has a limited solubility in water (~ 120 mg/L), whilst carbon dioxide has a solubility of 1450 mg/L in water at 25 OC and 1 atm. pressure. Thus carbon dioxide can create up to 12 times more dissolved gas than air, which will erupt out of solution when the stock pressure is reduced to one atmosphere as occurs at the flowbox slice. So while entrained air was a minor annoyance, entrained carbon dioxide can be a major problem. Up until now, the method for measuring entrained gas yielded a total entrained gas result and did not distinguish between air and carbon dioxide. Recent developments have resulted in a new test procedure which allows the measurement of both total gases and CO 2. The method is simple, fast and reproducible as long as the carbon dioxide pressure-solubility ratio is borne in mind – i. e. correct sampling is a critical step in obtaining accurate results. This paper discusses the development of the test method and the background chemistry {{of carbon dioxide}} addition to paper machine stock systems...|$|R
