The VNTR in intron 4 affects eNOS expression, and the susceptibility to hypertension, preeclampsia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus.

Haplotypes including the SNPs g.-786T>C and Glu298Asp and the VNTR in intron 4 affected the susceptibility to hypertension, preeclampsia, and hypertension in diabetic subjects,NOS3 variants may also affect the responses to drugs that affect NO signaling, such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (PDE5i). Statin treatment was more effective in increasing NO bioavailability in subjects carrying the CC genotype for the g.-786T>C polymorphism than in TT carriers. Hypertensive patients carrying the TC/CC genotypes and the C allele for the g.-786T>C polymorphism showed better antihypertensive responses to ACEi enalapril. Likewise, patients with erectile dysfunction carrying the C allele for g.-786T>C polymorphism showed better responses to PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil. Together, these studies suggest that statins, ACEi and PDE-5 inhibitors may restore an impaired NO production in subjects carrying the variant allele/genotype for g.-786T>C NOS3 polymorphism, thus attenuating the cardiovascular risk. In addition to analysis of genetic polymorphisms individually, haplotypes including the SNPs g.-786T>C and Glu298Asp and the VNTR in intron 4 were showen to affect the responses to sildenafil in patients with erectile dysfunction.|$|E

40|$|For optimal activation, T {{suppressor}} cells must {{receive a}} signal froma specialized inducer cell. The activating signal is delivered by a molecular complex that is composed, in part, of <b>polymorphic</b> <b>gene</b> {{products that are}} controlled by the immunoglobulin heavy chain complex (Igh) and that map to the variable region (Igh-V) of the complex. Consequently, if suppressor/inducer cells and their acceptor cells do not share Igh-V-encoded polymorphisms, the inducer molecules fail to activate the suppressor cells. Other <b>polymorphic</b> <b>gene</b> products (those that act as transplantation antigens on methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcomas) {{have been shown to}} be encoded by a gene(s) that maps to the same general region of chromosome 12 as does the Igh complex. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that <b>polymorphic</b> <b>gene</b> products expressed by the T suppressor/inducer cell and its biologically active product were related to the transplantation antigens on these fibrosarcomas. We have found that isoantisera directed to a number of BALB/c methylcholanthrene-induced tumors block the induction of T suppressor cells but they do so only if the inducer or acceptor T cell (or both) expresses BALB/c Igh-linked polymorphisms. All other BALB/c gene products are irrelevant. These findings suggest that “transformation related antigens” on some sarcoma cells are variants of, or are otherwise related to, the cell interaction molecules that T cell subsets use to communicate with one another under normal circumstances. Furthermore, the findings that (a) multiple methylcholanthrene-induced tumors express serologically related antigens (as well as the unique ones that have been previously demonstrated by transplantation tests) and (b) these serologically related antigens can be found on Igh-V-controlled T cell communication molecules raise the intriguing possibility that, like certain viruses, methylcholanthrene reacts with specific regions of cellular DNA that either directly or indirectly regulate the expression of other specific genes (in this particular case the genes that encode the T cell communication molecules) ...|$|E

We have previously identified a significant {{quantitative trait locus}} denoted Cia 40 on chromosome 11 that affects CIA in older female mice. This locus colocalizes with another locus, denoted Pregq 2, known to affect reproductive success. The present study was performed to evaluate {{the role of the}} Cia 40 locus in congenic B 10. Q mice and to identify possible <b>polymorphic</b> candidate <b>genes,</b> which may also be relevant in the context of RA. METHODS: Congenic B 10. Q mice carrying an NFR/N fragment surrounding the Cia 40 /Pregq 2 loci were created by 10 generations of backcrossing (N 10). The congenic mice were investigated in the CIA model, and the incidence and severity of arthritis as well as the serum levels of anti-collagen II (CII) antibodies were recorded. RESULTS: Significant effects on onset, incidence, severity, and anti-CII antibody titers were observed in female mice carrying a heterozygous congenic Cia 40 /Pregq 2 fragment of NFR/N origin, containing one or more <b>polymorphic</b> <b>genes.</b> Congenic male mice did not show increased incidence of CIA, but males carrying a heterozygous fragment showed a significant increase in severity in comparison with wildtype B 10.

CONCLUSION: The Cia 40 /Pregq 2 locus at chromosome 11 contains one or more <b>polymorphic</b> <b>genes</b> of NFR/N origin that significantly influence both incidence and severity of CIA in heterozygous congenic mice of the B 10.

The SW pigment is encoded in both cases by an autosomal gene and, in Old World primates, the MW and LW pigments by separate genes on the X chromosome. In contrast, {{there is a single}} polymorphic X-linked gene in most New World primates with three alleles coding for spectrally distinct pigments. The one reported exception to this rule is the New World howler monkey that follows the Old World system of separate LW and MW genes. A comparison of gene sequences in these different genetic systems indicates that the duplication that gave rise to the separate MW and LW genes of Old World primates is more ancient than that in the howler monkey. In addition, the amino acid sequences of the two howler monkey pigments show similarities to the pigments encoded by the <b>polymorphic</b> <b>gene</b> of other New World primates.
