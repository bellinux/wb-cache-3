5000|$|From its inception, Workbench {{offered a}} highly {{customizable}} interface. The user {{could change the}} aspect of <b>program</b> <b>icons</b> replacing it with newer ones with different color combinations.

When the user executes the program, by clicking a stored image icon, the AmigaOS operating system loads the WHDLoad executable and starts it. Then the loader checks the software and hardware environment, loads and checks the Slave interface required for that chosen demo or game and allocates required memory for the installed program. If the Preload feature is enabled into the requester page of WHDLoad, then the program attempts to load disk images and files into RAM (insofar as free memory is available).|$|E

50|$|New {{versions}} {{have not}} always been {{at the same time as}} the equivalent Office releases despite being numbered similarly; notably the 2002 release was excluded from the Office XP suites due to a lack of equivalent programmability, and 2006 was released well before Office 2007. The <b>program's</b> <b>icon</b> and toolbars were not updated until the 2009 release to stay consistent with modern software applications.|$|R
5000|$|Most pre-1995 {{versions}} {{contained a}} GUI {{very similar to}} Apple Computer's At Ease, but without the folders. Unlike At Ease, programs were grouped in sections such as [...] "Microsoft DOS", [...] "Microsoft Windows", [...] "Service & Support", and [...] "Software". The [...] "Software" [...] section was the only section users could customise and modify <b>program</b> <b>icons,</b> paths, and links. The above sections appeared as icons at startup.|$|R
50|$|This {{version was}} {{released}} in 1991. It was a real graphical interface where the user could create multiple screens. In each screen group <b>icons</b> and <b>program</b> <b>icons</b> could be placed together with a picture. The picture could be selected from an internal library or created with a picture editor {{which was part of}} the software. Background pictures could be set, passwords could be set on icons and main exit-command... Navigation was done by using the keyboard or a mouse.|$|R
50|$|Graphical environments such as RISC OS and ROX Desktop {{also make}} use of pipelines. Rather than {{providing}} a save dialog box containing a file manager to let the user specify where a program should write data, RISC OS and ROX provide a save dialog box containing an icon (and a field to specify the name). The destination is specified by dragging and dropping the icon. The user can drop the icon anywhere an already-saved file could be dropped, including onto <b>icons</b> of other <b>programs.</b> If the <b>icon</b> is dropped onto a <b>program's</b> <b>icon,</b> it's loaded and the contents that {{would otherwise have been}} saved are passed in on the new program's standard input stream.|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} to the competing Mac OS and Atari, the early Amiga Workbench (pre-Workbench 2.04) featured, as the default, a 4 color blue desktop screen with color icons at 640 × 200 NTSC American standard or 640 × 256 on European PAL television sets, {{in contrast to the}} 512 × 342 black and white interface presented by the Mac. The Amiga user was also free to create and modify system and <b>program</b> <b>icons,</b> while Atari TOS featured only default system icons whose appearance could not be modified.|$|R

This, the court claimed, was supported by the legal precedent of Lough v. Brunswick Corp. Here the court leveraged Konrad's own testimony that the starter client used in the actual invention [...] "is very similar to, if not the same as, software <b>program</b> <b>icons</b> created to quickly initiate a program", and hence can be easily derived from the demonstration, which featured initialization via a terminal.|$|R

50|$|The Psion Series 3 {{models were}} a major advance on the Psion Organiser. They had an {{original}} way of managing files: the available <b>program</b> <b>icons</b> {{are shown in}} a horizontal line and the associated files drop down beneath them. Manufacture of Psion 3s was discontinued in 1998 shortly after {{the launch of the}} Psion Series 5 (a Psion Series 4 does not exist, due to Psion's concern of tetraphobia in their Asian markets) and the Psion Siena. Psion's industrial hardware division continue to produce handhelds running the same 16-bit operating system, some 17 years after its introduction on the Psion MC range of laptops and 5 years after Psion Computer's final 32-bit EPOC PDA was released.|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} society {{has become increasingly}} dependant on programs that are subjected to frequent evolutive, basic and logical changes {{for a variety of}} reasons whereas the visual design of the program/program interface mostly remains the same or gets slightly modified. The development of technology has become to such an extent a commonplace that the use of redesigned <b>programs</b> implies <b>icons</b> that are visually acceptable although representing obsolete technologies and that are eventually hard to change due to the habits developed by the program users. The research presents a study into the personal preference as to a particular icon, “Save” for example, and into the perception of the visual identities of today's programs under the circumstance of <b>program</b> <b>icons</b> being not compliant with the technological state-of-the-art. Based on the obtained results, the survey that included students attending web design and media technician courses and ECDL course participants who come in contact with computers and programming tools for the first time should enlighten both teachers and designers of programming interfaces about the way of linking the formal knowledge with a constructivist approach to designing and redesigning programs...|$|R

50|$|The {{metadata}} written {{within the}} file, implemented in Vista, is also utilized in Windows 7. This can sometimes lead to long wait times displaying {{the contents of}} a folder. For example, if a folder contains many large video files totaling hundreds of gigabytes, and the Window Explorer pane is in Details view mode showing a property contained within the metadata (for example Date, Length, Frame Height), Windows Explorer might have to search the contents of the whole file for the meta data. Some damaged files can cause a prolonged delay as well. This is due to metadata information being able to be placed anywhere within the file, beginning, middle, or end, necessitating a search of the whole file. Lengthy delays also occur when displaying {{the contents of a}} folder with many different types of <b>program</b> <b>icons.</b> The icon is contained in the metadata. Some programs cause the activation of a virus scan when retrieving the icon information from the metadata, hence producing a lengthy delay.|$|R

40|$|High-level {{programming}} language features simplify software development by eliminating many low-level programming concerns and by providing programmers with useful abstractions to simplify description {{and analysis of}} their programs. This dissertation discusses briefly some of {{the special needs of}} structural pattern-matching programs that must execute in real time and suggests language features to support these needs. These language features are implemented in an experimental version of the <b>Icon</b> <b>programming</b> language and examples of how these language features can be used are presented. This dissertation also presents and discusses the implementation of these language mechanisms, including the implementation of a new algorithm for garbage collecting linked data structures and strings in real time. One of the new language features is a stream data type, which allows programmers to perform pattern matching directly on sequences of data values produced by external sources, without requiring explicit read operations to bring the data into memory before analyzing it. Other new language features provide the ability to create and manipulate concurrent Icon processes, between which the stream data type serves as the principal mechanism for interprocess communication. Stream and concurrent process manipulation mechanisms integrate naturally {{with each other and with}} the existing mechanisms of the <b>Icon</b> <b>programming</b> language. Sequential <b>Icon</b> <b>programs</b> are, for the most part, unaffected by the new language capabilities...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to visual programming which adopts principles and elements from dynamic multimodeling for structured procedural programming, especially graphics programming. Unlike most traditional visual programming languages which simply replace syntactic parts of program with graphical objects, we applied the principles of dynamic model types in modeling and simulation to create program models and execute/simulate them. With this approach, computer programs are constructed by visual modeling instead of textual writing. The motivation for a method using dynamic model types in graphics programming is also tied to several emerging research areas: novice user interfaces, <b>programming</b> visualization, customized <b>icons,</b> and a broader view of aesthetics within <b>programming.</b> Metaphoric <b>icons</b> are extensively used for the visual representation of program model elements. Rube, a Web- and XML-based modeling and simulation framework, provides the necessary environment for the construction, visualization and execution of program models. ...|$|R
