5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} involves striking {{your opponent}} as you realise he/she {{is about to}} strike. This is because their concentration will be on striking and their posture will have no flexibility to respond. Thus debana-waza is ideal. This can be to any <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> opponent's body, with valid strikes being: debana-men, debana-kote, and debana-tsuki.|$|E
25|$|Pieces {{that can}} slide forward promote far {{more easily than}} steppers or jumpers. As the board thins out their {{promotion}} becomes unavoidable, while steppers can almost always be met by an opponent stepper to neutralize it {{by the time it}} arrives at the promotion zone. The potential promotion gain of the sliders is thus always {{an important part of the}} material balance, but if it makes up too large a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> total strength, you might be overwhelmed before you can develop this potential.|$|E

Again, at this level places are highly competitive with students applying from all over Birmingham and the surrounding areas. There are approximately 50 external candidates in each year.|$|E
25|$|Former President Joseph Estrada {{expressed}} condemnation {{towards the}} rebels {{saying that a}} peace talk with them would not work and believes a declaration of an all-out war against them is only {{the solution to the}} peace process in Mindanao. Former President Fidel V. Ramos remains supportive of the peace process even though he explains that the finalization of the peace process may be after President Benigno Aquino III's term. Despite his expression of support towards the peace process, Ramos still criticized Aquino saying “There should be no hesitation {{on the part of the}} commander in chief. Otherwise, it will be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> legacy to be always hesitant, flip-flopping.” He criticized Aquino, who is also the commander-in-chief of the PNP and the AFP, for his apparent poor strategic direction and asserts that it is the soldier, the policeman, the law enforcer, the guardian of security that suffers because of his decisions. Ramos also insists that Aquino should have made consultation with retired police officers and soldiers before the security operation in Mamasapano.|$|E
