30|$|The {{diversity}} {{and complexity of}} the infrared target image information model determine the infinite dimension characteristics of the infrared target recognition observation sample space, especially the increasing infrared interference and the further development of infrared suppression technology, which makes great difficulties for the recognition of infrared targets. The effectiveness of the target feature strongly depends {{on the quality of the}} image preprocessing, which is equivalent to the ability to detect and segment the target effectively in the preprocessing phase of the <b>primary</b> <b>vision</b> processing image (including edge detection, noise filtering [2], image enhancement) under complex background conditions (low signal-to-noise ratio, low contrast, scene change, and so on) [3]. At this time, the processing effect of human vision of the traditional processing method is difficult to achieve, and the processing algorithm with human visual characteristics has a relative advantage. Wavelet transform is an ideal mathematical model for human primary visual information processing [4]. The decomposition of the image signal is not only in the spatial and frequency domains but also in the direction of the information expression local characteristics, which conforms to the basic characteristics of the human vision for the processing of image information. From the spatial domain, the size and direction of some image targets and other details are different, so the image needs to be processed at different resolution and direction. Here, wavelet transform can give full play to its advantages and can be analyzed from the frequency domain. Wavelet transform can decompose all kinds of mixed signals with different frequencies into block signals with different frequencies. Wavelet denoising has the advantages of multiresolution and diversity of wavelet basis selection, which makes it very suitable for image and other signal denoising [5]. Therefore, wavelet transform is a powerful mathematical tool for <b>primary</b> <b>vision</b> processing.|$|R
