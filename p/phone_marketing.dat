25|$|One of {{the issues}} arising from {{unsolicited}} <b>phone</b> <b>marketing</b> is the dealing in individuals' personal information, ie. financial institutions selling personal information, balances and transaction information to third parties. However financial services companies, those that offer both banking, insurance, and investment products, say that the issue and attempted legislation on the topic was caused by smaller financial institutions who simply focused on one type of product or business. The {{reason for this is}} that combining all those products with one company creates a Walmart-style economies of scale and other synergies which are difficult to compete against as a single product line company. By putting forth legislation which forbids financial institutions from sharing information with other companies, single-product-line financial institutions could cripple integrated financial services companies because of the technicality that the banking, investments, and insurance parts of the business had to be operated under separate company affiliates within a holding company. Most financial services companies claim that they have never sold information to non-financial services companies. Some critics of financial institutions agreed with this analysis but continued to press for the legislation because they believed that the financial services integrated business model was fundamentally wrong; however the vast majority of critical articles focused on the issue of selling information to outside telemarketers.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade {{developments}} in telecommunication technology have created opportunities for new and interactive electronic marketing channels, such as the mobile phone. In particular, the ubiquitous and personal nature of this device suggests strong potential for its use as an advertising and direct marketing platform. Despite this, several issues surround {{the use of this}} device for marketing purposes, and as such, consumer acceptance of mobile phones as an electronic marketing medium remains relatively low. This study explores Australian consumers’ perceptions of mobile <b>phone</b> <b>marketing,</b> defined here as an electronic marketing innovation. Through the application of Rogers’s (1995) innovation attribute theory, this research makes an important contribution to understanding how consumer perceptions of the attributes associated with this innovation affect their acceptance of mobile <b>phone</b> <b>marketing</b> campaigns. Here, three attributes were examined: relative advantage, compatibility and complexity. Statistical analysis using a multiple hierarchical regression model revealed that consumers’ perceptions of compatibility and relative advantage were significantly associated with their perceptions of mobile <b>phone</b> <b>marketing.</b> The identification of compatibility as the key driver of acceptance supports previous research which identified permission, privacy, control, and the delivery of the message as key drivers of mobile <b>phone</b> <b>marketing</b> acceptance.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{findings}} of a recent study which explored consumer perceptions of mobile <b>phone</b> <b>marketing.</b> Through the application of constructs adapted from traditional innovation and product involvement research, the study examined how a consumer’s perception of the relative advantages, compatibility and complexity associated with mobile <b>phone</b> <b>marketing,</b> and their involvement with their mobile phone, influenced their intention to accept marketing communication sent via this channel. Design/methodology/approach – A deductive, quantitative research approach was adopted, where data was collected using a self-completed questionnaire administered to a sample of 254 university students. Findings – Statistical analysis revealed that a consumer’s perceptions of two of the three innovation attributes tested (relative advantage and compatibility) were significantly associated with their acceptance (or adoption) of marketing messages sent via their mobile phone. However, a slightly weaker relationship between a consumer’s level of involvement with their mobile phone and their adoption of mobile <b>phone</b> <b>marketing</b> was found. Practical implications – This research provides companies with important insights into the factors that may encourage or deter consumer acceptance of this new form of direct marketing. Originality/value – The value of this study derives from its novel use of an established innovation framework, combined with an assessment of product involvement, to examine consumer perceptions of mobile <b>phone</b> <b>marketing...</b>|$|E

40|$|That the {{compositing}} {{of camera}} and mobile phone {{has proven to}} be highly popular {{should come as no surprise}} to anyone interested in both the history of mobility and the history of photography. [1] As media archaeologist Errki Huhtamo recently asserted, the first mobile medium proper was amateur photography (Huhtamo, website, 2004). An examination of the correspondences between the reception and promotion of early amateur photography and the current fascination with (and revulsion of) mobile camera phone practices is instructive in terms of trying to understand our contemporary moment. In particular, the long association between amateur or snapshot photography and the family appears to be rapidly extending itself to the mobile camera phone. Camera <b>phone</b> <b>marketing</b> is awash with images of children, pets, family events and ritualised personal experiences. This raises a couple of interesting questions that this paper will seek to address. Firstly, what impact will camera phone imaging have, if any, on the existing practices of capturing, collecting and the distribution of family photographs? And secondly, how does the promotion of the family as a legitimate subject for mobile camera photography play out against the increasingly hysterical response to the use of mobile camera phones in public spaces...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This study {{examines}} {{the nature of}} consumers’ perceptions of the value they derive from the everyday experiential consumption of mobile phones and how mobile marketing (m-marketing) can potentially enhance these value perceptions. Methodology – Q methodology is used to examine how consumers’ subjective perceptions and opinions are shared at a collective level. Forty participants undertook two Q sorts and the data was analysed using PQ-method. Findings – The first Q sort identified three profiles of perceived value: the Mobile Pragmatists, the Mobile Connectors and the Mobile Revellers. The second Q sort identified two profiles of perceived value of m-marketing: one emerging from the shared opinions of the Mobile Pragmatists and the Mobile Connectors, and the second from the Mobile Revellers. Implications/limitations – The findings show how consumers can be segmented based on their contextualised perceived value of consuming mobile phones and how the potential for m-marketing is perceived in ways that can enhance these value perceptions. Limitations relate to deriving statements for the Q sorts and the generalisability of the results. Practical implications – The findings highlight ways to tailor m-marketing strategies to complement consumers’ perceptions of the value offered through their mobile phones. Originality/value of paper – The study {{contributes to the literature}} through using Q methodology to examine two subjective areas of consumer behaviour, experiential consumption and consumer perceived value.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This Project shows {{characteristics}} of Below the Line (BTL) advertising. It {{begins with the}} explanation of three important concepts to better understand this kind of advertising: marketing, communication and advertising. First of all, marketing is a process which defines the actions to broadcast the message of a company. Secondly, communication is responsible for broadcast these messages and it’s beneficial when it’s consistent and useful. Finally, advertising {{is the place where}} the foregoing is captured. It should be aimed at the audience the company wants to have or maintain. Above the Line (ATL) and Below the Line techniques are explained to compare their general characteristics later. Above the line advertising consists of television, cinema, radio, print and outdoor advertising. Advertiser sends messages through mass media. On the other hand, BTL sales promotion uses different methods of advertising, which encourage customers to purchase. It may include a lot of activities such as direct marketing, sponsorship, sales promotion, telemarketing, etc. Despite of the fact that BTL is usually joined to ATL, what makes it different is that the first group of techniques, not only intend to draw attention but establish a relationship with the customer. In this way, current advertising saturation problems are avoided and the memory of an ad and the brand image are strengthened. This kind of advertising has several advantages over ATL like its low cost, versatility, high segmentation, direct contact with customers and Publicity, among others. For these reasons, it has a greatest investment; especially in direct mailing, <b>phone</b> <b>marketing</b> and point-of-sale advertising, despite the current crisis and the advertising budget cut. The future of BTL focuses on new technologies, social awareness and a more personal advertising. Grado en Administración y Dirección de Empresa...|$|E
