Aim of this research is the testing of two commercial product: an anti-hygro, a <b>protective</b> <b>product</b> which reduces the swelling ability of clay and zeolitic minerals and a polymeric consolidant (ethyl silicate) applied to Neapolitan Yellow Tuff (TGN), the oldest building material in the Naples area. Moreover, in order to better evaluate the mechanisms of stone consolidation, it was selected, for comparison, a porous sedimentary rock, Pietra di Vicenza, with a pore radii distribution similar to TGN. The two stones were saturated by immersion under laboratory conditions. Specimens were divided into test group: untreated, treated with consolidant and treated with antihygro and consolidant. Investigations were conducted before and after each treatment and included mineralogical and petrographic analyses (XRD, XRF, SEM), physical and mechanical determinations (porosity, pore radii distribution, capillarity absorption, water absorption (by immersion), ultrasonic wave velocity measurements, compressive strength, colorimetric measurements). Furthermore consolidated samples were subjected to ageing tests such as freeze-thaw cycles, salt crystallization tests and salt spray; in order to evaluate and measure the effectiveness of consolidation and to study changes in stone properties...|$|E

Protection problems in this field are important in Italy, where a great number of these treasures are often in heavily-polluted environments, and, consequently, undergo a continuous destructive action. The problem of the protection of marmor surfaces can be tackled according to various approaches.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{environmental}} resistance {{is a critical}} material barrier to the operation of fossil systems with the improved energy efficiencies and emissions performance described by {{the goals of the}} Vision 21 concept of the U. S. Department of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy. All fossil fuel-derived processes contain reactive species and high-temperature degradation arising from reactions of solids with gases and condensible products often limits performance or materials lifetimes such that efficiency, emission, and/or economic targets or requirements are not realized. Therefore, historically, the development of materials for fossil-fuel combustion and conversion systems has been closely linked to corrosion studies of alloys and ceramics in appropriate environments. This project is somewhat different from such studies in that it focuses on the feasibility of new routes to controlling the critical chemical and mechanical phenomena that collectively form the basis for environmental protection in relevant fossil environments by exploring compositional and microstructural manipulations and cooperative phenomena that have not necessarily been examined in any detail to date. This can hopefully lead to concepts for ''smart'' coatings or materials that have the ability to sense and respond appropriately to a particular set or series of environmental conditions in order to provide high-temperature corrosion protection. The strategies being explored involve cooperative or in-place oxidation or sulfidation reactions of multiphase alloys. [1, 2] The first material systems to be evaluated involve silicides as {{there is some evidence that}} such materials have enhanced resistance in oxidizing-sulfidizing and sulfidizing environments and in air/oxygen at very high temperatures. [3] In this regard, molybdenum silicides may prove to be of particular interest. Molybdenum is known to sulfidize fairly slowly[4] and there has been recent progress in developing Mo-Si-B systems with improved oxidation resistance at high and intermediate temperatures. [5 - 11] Consequently, Mo-Si-B alloys with different compositions and phase morphologies were oxidized in dry air at 1200 C under cyclic oxidation conditions. In addition, elevated-temperature oxidation-sulfidation exposures of Mo-Mo 5 SiB 2 -Mo 3 Si alloys also were conducted. In this way, the specific effects of the multiphase nature (composition, morphology) of the Mo-Si-B system on <b>protective</b> <b>product</b> formation are being evaluated...|$|E

It is inspired by the two major project methodologies of Deming’s "Plan – Do – Check – Act (PDCA) " Cycle which consists of DMAIC and DMADV. Those two methodologies are comprised of five phases. The DMAIC project methodology will be comprehensively used in this research. In brief, DMAIC is utilised for improving the existing manufacturing process and it involves the phases Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, and Control. Mask industry has become a significant industry in today’s society since the outbreak of some serious diseases such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), bird flu, influenza, swine flu and hay fever. Protecting the respiratory system, then, has become the fundamental requirement for preventing respiratory deceases. Mask is the most appropriate and <b>protective</b> <b>product</b> inasmuch as it is effective in protecting the respiratory tract and resisting the virus infection through air. In order to satisfy various customers’ requirements, thousands of mask products are designed in the market. Moreover, masks are also widely used in industries including medical industries, semi-conductor industries, food industries, traditional manufacturing, and metal industries. Notwithstanding the quality of masks have become the prioritisations since they are used to prevent dangerous diseases and safeguard people, the quality improvement technique are of very high significance in mask industry. The purpose of this research project is firstly to investigate the current quality control practices in a mask industry, then, to explore the feasibility of using Six Sigma technique in that industry, and finally, to implement the Six Sigma technique in the case company to develop and evaluate the product quality process. This research mainly investigates the quality problems of musk industry and effectiveness of six sigma technique in musk industry with the United Excel Enterprise Corporation (UEE) Company as a case company.

40|$|For fluid-solid {{reactions}} {{a random}} pore model is developed {{which accounts for}} arbitrary pore-size distributions as well as pore intersections in a reacting solid. The model is quite versatile and subsumes the prior grain models as special cases. It is found that a rate maximum may be expected for certain pore size distributions but not for others. In {{the initial stages of}} reaction the rate increases with conversion due to increase in the surface area as pore growth occurs, but this effect is overshadowed in later stages by pore intersections which reduce surface area. The model indicates that given the porosity and surface area, a solid possessing uniform size pores is intrinsically the least reactive. The data of Hashimoto, et al. (1979) on the surface area development and conversion-time behavior during char gasification are found to produce correlations consistent with the expectations of the model. ^ The model is formulated to include as well transport effects arising from boundary layer, intraparticle and product layer diffusion. It is found that the rate and surface area maxima predicted in the kinetic regime are shifted to lower conversions as intraparticle or product layer diffusional resistances increase. For reactions accompanied by an increase in the volume of the solid phase it is shown that incomplete conversions may be expected due to pore closure, the ultimate conversion decreasing with an increase in the intrapellet diffusional resistance. The model is also applied to the data of Borgwardt (1970) and of Hartman and Coughlin (1976) on the reaction between CO(, 2) and lime in the presence of oxygen, where the calcium sulfate produced forms a <b>protective</b> <b>product</b> layer. It is seen that the reaction is diffusion controlled under the conditions of Hartman and Coughlin (1976) consistent with their own findings, and a prior Pigford and Sliger (1973) interpretation. The temperature behavior of the diffusion coefficient in the product layer suggests the participation of an activated process, possibly a solid state step. ^ TGA experiments were conducted with the reaction between CO(, 2) and lime, in the range of 400 (DEGREES) C to 725 (DEGREES) C, with a view to examine the effect of product layer deposition and of varying pore structures on the kinetics. Limes with different pore structures were obtained for reactions by calcining limestone under varying partial pressures of carbon dioxide in nitrogen. It is found that the recarbonation reaction is initially chemically controlled, before undergoing a rapid transition to a much slower regime controlled by product layer diffusion. The magnitude of the product layer diffusivity, in the range of 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 14) to 10 (2 ̆ 7 - 17) cm(2 ̆ 72) /sec, and the activation energy of about 20 kcal/gmole below 515 (DEGREES) C, and 40 kcal/gmole above 515 (DEGREES) C, are suggestive of solid state diffusion. Most likely the mechanism involves countercurrent motion of carbonate and oxygen ions below 515 (DEGREES) C, and sitewise motion of decomposition-produced CO(, 2) above this temperature. ...|$|E

40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the use of non destructive techniques (NDTs) in the assessment of the conservation state, evaluation of the intervention effectiveness and monitoring of restored historical architectural surfaces [1]. A brief review of ND methods tailored on the authors experience will be given, together with the description of some NDT applications on real case studies, in relation to selected types of decay commonly found. Furthermore, an open discussion on i) the role and the good practices for ND monitoring; ii) the problems related to the individuation of indicators and corresponding threshold values for evaluating the materials conservation state; iii) the efficacy/durability of conservative interventions are discussed. 1. Introduction In the last 30 years, conservators have become more conscious of the restoration risks linked to the incomplete assessment of the intervention effectiveness and to the use of innovative restoration materials and techniques, whose behavior and compatibility over time is not entirely known, yet. The post-intervention diagnosis and the monitoring over time have been recognized as an essential action in the conservation of the Cultural Heritage (CH). n this frame, NDTs could give a significant contribution not only in the definition of the conservation state of architectural surfaces, but also during and after maintenance and restoration interventions. The NDTs can address and reduce invasive sampling and allow an extensive evaluation of the variation of some characteristics (colour, water absorption, surface texture, cohesion, detachment, etc.) [2]. The importance of NDTs is enhanced for continuous or repeated monitoring campaigns in order to assess the restoration functionality accordingly to specific conservation questions. Throughout these campaigns, the use of invasive techniques might be however necessary but they should not be a priori choice if not supported and planned on the results obtained by NDTs. 2. Consideration about NDT and common decay in historical surfaces In this contribution different case studies will be presented in relation to decay forms and material properties, significant of the post intervention state of architectural surfaces. The decay forms considered, chosen because of their frequency and impact on historical surfaces, are: detachments, disaggregation/loss of material coherence, discolouration, deposits and moisture. The mural paintings of Léon Tarasewicz in the Perusini’s Tower of Corno di Rosazzo, Udine (Italy), has been analyzed by IR-thermography, working in the middle IR range 3 - 5 µm. This NDT allowed the detection of subsurface defects, such as: detachments of the painting layers not visible by naked eye observation, cracks and air voids[3, 4]. The investigation of the material coherence might be evidenced by 2 D and 3 D ultrasonic tomography. In the cases of 'Loggia dei Viretti’ at the Sacra di San Michele near Turin and of the Ghirlandina Tower in Modena the US measurements evidenced the increased coherence after the consolidation intervention and homogenously treated area [5 - 7]. The variation of the surface behaviour after the application of a <b>protective</b> <b>product</b> can be investigated by colorimetry of treated surfaces [9] or, in relation to liquid water, with in-situ contact SOCIETÀ CHIMICA ITALIANA Divisione di Chimica dell’Ambiente e dei Beni Culturali 78 angle measurement and water absorption at low pressure with the pipette method [10]. These three methods were useful in the case of Ghirlandina Tower in Modena where they evidenced the decrease of the water repellent effect after 5 years. The analyses of the surface composition can show the difference among original, decay deposits and superimposed materials. For this purpose, Raman spectroscopy with hand-held instrument was used in the didactic workshop held in Cibiana di Cadore (Belluno) [8]. 3. Conclusion and perspectives Performing an analysis implies: economic costs, availability of analytic techniques and of skilled professionals; furthermore in the field of cultural heritage it implies also a “cultural-social” cost (e. g. the collection of samples might be a in itself a cost since it affects the artefact integrity). Therefore, the balance cost-benefit should be taken into account in CH diagnosis and monitoring, by involving non or micro invasive, easy to do, effective analyses before more expensive and invasive investigation [2, 8]. Furthermore, an increased contribution of NDTs in the post intervention monitoring and safeguarding of historical surfaces is of particular importance, since it allow a farsighted and well-planned monitoring that permits timely and effective conservation actions. Specific protocols and best practices should be developed {{in order to reduce the}} subjectivity and to obtain complementary information from several ND methods...|$|E

Refurbishment should be adopted to preserve the essential features of the building´s history and cultural heritage. Reconstruction of internal plaster in historical buildings belongs to important treatment in a landmark area. Plaster of historical buildings is usually characterized by an open porosity, which makes it sensitive to the degradation caused by physical and chemical agents. Alterations and structural faults can lead to invasive interventions which modify permanently the cultural value and the structural behavior of the buildings, in conflict with necessary preservation requirements. Knowledge of the historical building interior microclimate is essential for the definition of suitable reconstruction.
