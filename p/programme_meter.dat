30|$|In {{parallel}} with these drivers, the penetration of renewables in Ireland has increased to 27.8 % of gross electricity consumption in 2015 (Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), 2016) which is increasing year-on-year, and these renewables {{are also being}} extended in terms of distributed generation/microgrids along with centralized renewable-based electricity generation. This proliferation of distributed generation enables infrastructure changes to address the dynamic nature of the demand side. Irish government is also implementing the smart <b>meter</b> <b>programme</b> which will make the electricity infrastructure more flexible to integrate with other innovative technologies. With intelligent, connected components plugged into an increasingly smarter grid, electricity consumers will become direct participants in the energy network.|$|R

25|$|In July 2013, Irish Water {{was legally}} {{established}} {{and began a}} national <b>metering</b> <b>programme.</b> The company was expected to initially install meters for approximately 1.05million households. Domestic water charges were scheduled to commence in October 2014, with households receiving their first bills in Quarter 1 2015, with bills paid for usage in arrears. Irish Water would hence become the national water services authority, assuming all responsibilities for water services from local authorities - except for those relating to certain rural water services and inspections of wastewater treatment systems. Ireland's 34 local authorities were to continue to provide some drinking and waste water services on behalf of Irish Water through a service level agreement.|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} policy {{alternatives that}} the City of Vancouver could explore to encourage water conservation among residential water users. Using both {{quantitative and qualitative}} data, the study identifies {{the factors that influence}} per capita residential water demands in Canadian cities and the relevant policy instruments applied to encourage water conservation. Primary data sources are Environment Canada surveys of municipal water systems and case studies from the United States of best practices with respect to water conservation. The data analysis reveals that the price of water, metering, educational conservation policies, and non-price incentives are significant factors affecting per capita residential water demand. Following that, this study proposes and assesses policies to reform water management in Vancouver. Policy recommendations to the city include: (i) introducing a universal water <b>metering</b> <b>programme</b> and (ii) applying increasing block rate pricing to encourage water conservation among the public...|$|R
40|$|Ireland {{is one of}} a {{very small}} number of {{countries}} in the world which do not charge for domestic drinking water supply. Recent developments have indicated that the reintroduction of domestic charges in Ireland is being planned. Ireland has a daily average water usage per person of around 150 litres and an increasing demand for clean water reserves and talks of imminent water metering and charges. This paper investigates the current status of water resources and water supply in Ireland, and assesses the technical, economic and political challenges involved with the reintroduction of domestic water charges accompanied by the implementation of a domestic <b>metering</b> <b>programme.</b> The study highlights the need for a system of water charging and metering in Ireland to ensure more careful management of water resources, to promote more sustainable use of water, and to provide a more stable revenue stream for local authorities...|$|R
50|$|The {{department}} {{as it stands}} today was formed in 1993 from the merger of the BBC Designs Department and the BBC Research Department. From 2006 to 2008 it was known as Research and Innovation but has since reverted to its original name. BBC Research & Development has made major contributions to broadcast technology, carrying out original research in many areas, and developing items like the peak <b>programme</b> <b>meter</b> (PPM) which {{became the basis for}} many world standards.|$|E
5000|$|In about 1936 and 1937, German {{broadcasters}} {{developed a}} peak <b>programme</b> <b>meter</b> with a mirror galvanometer {{known as a}} [...] "Lichtzeigerinstrument" [...] (light pointer) for the display. The system consisted of a drive amplifier (e.g., ARD types U21 and U71) and a separate display unit (e.g., ARD types J47 and J48). A stereo version, known as a [...] "Doppel-Lichtzeigerinstrument" [...] contained two mirror galvanometer displays in a single housing. Such displays were still used until the 1970s, when solid-state bargraph displays became the norm.|$|E
50|$|In {{audio quality}} measurement, {{quasi-peak}} rectifiers are specified in several standards. For example ITU-R 468 noise weighting uses a special rectifier incorporating two cascaded charging time constants. The PPM or peak <b>programme</b> <b>meter</b> {{used to measure}} programme levels is actually a quasi-peak reading meter, again with precisely defined dynamics. Flutter measurement also involves a standardised quasi-peak reading meter. In every case the dynamics are chosen to reflect the sensitivity of human hearing to brief sounds, ignoring those so brief {{that we do not}} perceive them, and weighting those of intermediate duration according to audibility.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the results from a field study on smart {{metering}} in Germany and Austria, focusing {{on the effects of}} providing feedback information on average electricity consumption. Econometric analyses are applied using a cross section of observations for more than 2000 households served by nine utilities. More than half of these households received feedback on their electric-ity consumption together with information about electricity saving measures (pi-lot group). The remaining households served as a control group. To evaluate the impact of feedback information, we econometrically estimated household electricity consumption. Explanatory variables include a wide range of socio-economic factors (income, education, age, household size, age composition, etc.) as well as the household appliance stock (large appliances, boiler, com-puters, TV, etc. [...] .). The results suggest that the feedback provided under the smart <b>metering</b> <b>programme</b> results in electricity savings of around 3. 7 %.

From 1953-1960 and again from 1969-1973 one of its masts was used for transmission on frequency 173 kHz. Between 1975 and 1978 the transmitter was reconstructed and from November 1978 its transmission power increased to 1500 kW. On 1 October 1989 the frequency was changed to 270 kHz. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989 the broadcast programme was renamed from [...] "HvÄ›zda" [...] to [...] "RadioÅ¾urnÃ¡l". In January 1994 one of the masts was switched off to cut costs, reducing the output power to 750 kW. Further reduction of output power followed in January 2002, to 650 kW. As {{there were very few}} other transmitters working on the frequency 270 kHz its programme ("ÄŒRo 1 - RadioÅ¾urnÃ¡l") was clearly received across the whole of Europe, especially during the night.|$|R

Next the report provides a short overview of the legal framework governing metering activities in Europe, as well as a review of smart metering policies, a summary of regulatory and legislative tools and an analysis of cases in selected countries. Drawing from the experiences to date, the report concludes with a set of recommendations for policy makers to consider when developing a smart <b>metering</b> <b>programme</b> and the regulatory approaches that could be adopted at national and/or EU level to encourage compatibility of smart metering solutions and to accelerate implementation of smart meters and smart grids. energy policy; electricity; electricity; regulation...|$|R
50|$|In {{professional}} usage, where consistent level {{measurements are}} needed across an industry, audio level meters often {{comply with a}} detailed formal standard. This ensures that all compliant meters indicate the same level for a given audio signal. The principal standard for PPMs is IEC 60268-10. It describes two different quasi-PPM designs that have roots in meters originally developed in the 1930s for the AM radio broadcasting networks of Germany (Type I) and the United Kingdom (Type II). The term Peak <b>Programme</b> <b>Meter</b> usually refers to these IEC-specified types and similar designs. Though originally designed for monitoring analogue audio signals, these PPMs are now also used with digital audio.|$|E
40|$|In the US, {{buildings}} represent around 40 % of {{the primary}} energy consumption and 74 % of the electrical energy consumption [U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). 2012. 2011 Buildings Energy Data Book. Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy]. Incentives to promote the installation of on-site renewable energy sources have emerged in different states, including net <b>metering</b> <b>programmes.</b> The fast spread of such distributed power generation represents additional challenges {{for the management of}} the electricity grid and has led to increased interest in smart control of building loads and demand response programmes. This paper presents a general methodology for assessing opportunities associated with optimal load management in response to evolving utility incentives for residential buildings that employ renewable energy sources and energy storage. An optimal control problem is formulated for manipulating thermostatically controlled domestic loads and energy storage in response to the availability of renewable energy generation and utility net metering incentives. The methodology is demonstrated for a typical American house built in the 1990 s and equipped with a single-speed air-to-air heat pump, an electric water heater and photovoltaic (PV) collectors. The additional potential associated with utilizing electrical batteries is also considered. Load matching performance for on-site renewable energy generation is characterized in terms of percentage of the electricity production consumed on-site and the proportion of the demand covered. For the purpose of assessing potential, simulations were performed assuming perfect predictions of the electrical load profiles. The method also allows determination of the optimal size of PV systems for a given net <b>metering</b> <b>programme.</b> Results of the case study showed significant benefits associated with control optimization including an increase of load matching between 3 % and 28 %, with the improvement dependent on the net metering tariff and available storage capacity. The estimated cost savings for the consumer ranged from 6. 4 % to 27. 5 % compared to no optimization with a unitary buy-back ratio, depending on the available storage capacity. Related reduction in CO 2 emissions were between 11 % and 46 %. Optimal load management of the home thermal systems allowed an increase in the optimal size of the PV system in the range of 13 â€“ 21 %. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} four decades the locus of {{economic}} power has shifted from industry to finance. As part of this trend, the 'financialisation' of the water sector has added a new layer of complexity to the hydrosocial cycle, witnessed in the emergence of new financial actors, logics and financing instruments. Such a shift has profoundly reshaped the relationship between water utilities and consumers in the South East of England, where the household has become, in the words of Allen and Pryke (2013), a human revenue stream for financialised utilities. In this paper, we make an argument that the water meter is one of the crucial mediators through which finance will touch the lives of individual subjects. In the South East of England, after initial opposition to universal metering â€“ in part shaped by fears over fluctuating revenues â€“ water companies are now embedding a <b>metering</b> <b>programme</b> within a billing and tariff structure that aims to ensure governable and predictable subjects. Drawing on Urban Political Ecology, we argue that the financialisation of the water sector in England shapes the emergence of new financial subjectivities while enabling new forms of political rule that operate at a range of spatial scales...|$|R
40|$|Demand Side Management (DSM) is the {{planning}} and implementation of strategies intended to encourage electricity consumers to reduce energy demand, improve energy efficiency, shift time of usage and promote the use of renewable energy based distributed generation system. It is a close socio- economic link between the utility and consumer for mutually benefiting to both. The research undertaken rivets on the potential use of DSM strategies to regulate electrical energy demand and mitigate carbon emissions in Oman. The main objective {{of this research is}} to examine the DSM based activities and policy options which could achieve significant reduction in electricity demand at the distribution network connected to the residential sector. It is revealed that temperature is the major environmental factor while use of air- conditioner units and practice of subsidised tariffs are epic centres of lavish electricity consumption at residential sector in Oman. This study applies a scenario based approach to identify viable energy efficiency and load reduction methods. The technical analysis comprises of bottom-up approach considering operational, behavioural and environmental factors to simulate the hourly load profile. Household load patterns are developed to identify and implement a range of DSM technological activities. An analytical model is set up to control the household load with minimal compromise of end-user satisfaction. Obtained results show that application of DSM strategies could contribute the substantial reduction in peak load and total energy demand. Studies carried out on renewable energy based hybrid power system manifest the viability and cost effectiveness of distributed generation to mitigate carbon emissions and peak load demand. The results of technical analysis are used to explicate the essential policy priorities underpinning the sustainable development of energy sector and mitigate the environmental issues. This comprehensive study provides the base to recommend the incentive based DSM <b>programmes,</b> smart <b>metering,</b> legal frame work for energy efficiency standards and labelling, investment subsidies to encourage renewable energy and legislation for distributed generation.

40|$|Residential energy {{consumption}} {{is responsible for}} 27 % of the UKâ€™s carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. As energy consumers, people do not simply consume gas or electricity in their homes, but rather the services that energy provides. There {{has been a significant}} increase in {{energy consumption}} per household, related to the increase in household numbers and changes in lifestyles. High emissions from the UK residential sector are partly a consequence of old, inefficient building stock. However, householdsâ€™ energy behaviours form another and in many respects a more challenging problem. Previous research on household energy consumption suggests that feedback on energy use has the greatest potential to influence householdsâ€™ energy behaviours. Once people receive feedback on their consumption, they {{may be more likely to}} change their attitudes and behaviour. A limited number of feedback studies have been conducted in the UK. However, the UK Government has recently announced trials which pilot smart meter and display technologies as a way of providing feedback and thus potentially influencing UK householdsâ€™ energy consumption. This paper looks at the experience of previous research and how this can provide insights to the UK Governmentâ€™s smart <b>metering</b> <b>programme,</b> as well as suggestions for further research in this area...|$|R
50|$|Mr. Bean {{has bought}} a {{portable}} television, and after bringing it home {{and having to}} crawl out his car window, brings it up to his flat, whereupon he feeds his electricity meter a few coins to feed power to the wall. Upon getting the television {{out of the box}} and setting it on a stand, he realises he's looking at the rear of it. Bean slips its plug into a socket and wonders why it is not coming on, only to realise he forgot to wire the plug with the TV's power cable. Upon doing so by screwing the cable into the plug, the TV is soon turned on and the aerial plugged in, only for him to discover he gets no reception regardless of where he moves the aerial to. When he puts it on the ground, bends over and looks at it, the TV suddenly springs to life, only to go to static the moment Bean looks towards the TV screen. No matter what he does, he cannot get the TV to show programmes unless he is looking only at the aerial, with the TV screen not in his sights. Ingeniously he decides to take off all his clothes and assemble it on a chair to resemble himself, while using the TV's cardboard box to cover up, finally managing to get a clear picture on the TV. But just as he sits down to watch the <b>programme,</b> the electricity <b>meter</b> runs out and cuts off the power, much to his annoyance.|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in â€˜middle actorsâ€™ as influences on energy use in the built environment. This paper reports on novel research with four focus groups of meter installers, employed by three major energy suppliers, two in Great Britain and one in Northern Ireland. All the participants {{have been involved in}} installing smart meters or semi-smart keypad meters in homes. The Smart Metering Installation Code of Practice requires installers to be trained to communicate to householders the uses of, and potential benefits from, smart metering, along with any health and safety issues. Installers are also required to demonstrate how to use the in-home display that is offered to all customers, {{and to be able to}} give basic advice on energy efficiency. The smart meter rollout thus offers an opportunity for a representative of the supplier to go into every customerâ€™s home and talk about energy with household members. Using transcripts from the focus groups, we analyse what the installers have to say about their work in terms of training, support, challenges, rewards, household priorities and concerns, and organisational issues. This material illustrates the social learning that can take place during and around the time of installation, for the utility and the installers themselves, as well as among households and their social networks. It highlights issues for policymakers when planning and evaluating smart <b>metering</b> <b>programmes</b> in terms of customer benefits from demand reduction, particularly those relating to installer training and working arrangements. To set the focus group material in context, the paper draws on findings from the UK Smart Metering Early Learning Project, published in 2015, which included a large-scale household survey...|$|R
