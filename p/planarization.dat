5|$|Ceria is {{the most}} widely used {{compound}} of cerium. The main application of ceria is as a polishing compound, for example in chemical-mechanical <b>planarization</b> (CMP). In this application, ceria has replaced other metal oxides for the production of high-quality optical surfaces. Major automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles, Cerium(IV) sulfate is used as an oxidising agent in quantitative analysis. Cerium(IV) in methanesulfonic acid solutions is applied in industrial scale electrosynthesis as a recyclable oxidant. Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an oxidant in organic chemistry and in etching electronic components, and as a primary standard for quantitative analysis.|$|E

50|$|In {{incremental}} <b>planarization,</b> the <b>planarization</b> {{process is}} {{split into two}} stages. First, a large planar subgraph is found within the given graph. Then, the remaining edges that are not already part of this subgraph are added back one at a time, and routed through an embedding of the planar subgraph. When one of these edges crosses an already-embedded edge, the two edges that cross are replaced by two-edge paths, with a new artificial vertex that represents the crossing point placed at the middle of both paths. In some case a third local optimization stage {{is added to the}} <b>planarization</b> process, in which edges with many crossings are removed and re-added in an attempt to improve the <b>planarization.</b>|$|E

50|$|Once a large planar {{subgraph}} {{has been}} found, the incremental <b>planarization</b> process continues {{by considering the}} remaining edges one by one. As it does so, it maintains a <b>planarization</b> of the subgraph formed by the edges {{that have already been}} considered. It adds each new edge to a planar embedding of this subgraph, forming a drawing with crossings, and then replaces each crossing point with a new artificial vertex subdividing the two edges that cross. In some versions of this procedure, the order for adding edges is arbitrary, but it is also possible to choose the ordering to be a random permutation, running the same algorithm several times and returning the best <b>planarization</b> that it finds.|$|E

50|$|More recently, as {{the number}} of {{interconnect}} levels for logic has substantially increased due to the large number of transistors that are now interconnected in a modern microprocessor, the timing delay in the wiring has become so significant as to prompt a change in wiring material (from aluminum to copper layer) and a change in dielectric material (from silicon dioxides to newer low-K insulators). This performance enhancement also comes at a reduced cost via damascene processing, which eliminates processing steps. As the number of interconnect levels increases, <b>planarization</b> of the previous layers is required to ensure a flat surface prior to subsequent lithography. Without it, the levels would become increasingly crooked, extending outside the depth of focus of available lithography, and thus interfering with the ability to pattern. CMP (chemical-mechanical <b>planarization)</b> is the primary processing method to achieve such <b>planarization,</b> although dry etch back is still sometimes employed when the number of interconnect levels is no more than three.|$|E
50|$|Further {{mechanisms}} {{supporting the}} bonding process of not completely inert anodic materials {{can be the}} <b>planarization</b> or polishing of surfaces and the ablation of the surface layer by electrochemical etching.|$|E
50|$|In graph drawing, <b>planarization</b> is {{a method}} of {{extending}} drawing methods from planar graphs to graphs that are not planar, by embedding the non-planar graphs within a larger planar graph.|$|E

50|$|The process steps {{most often}} {{associated}} with process simulation are ion implantation, annealing (diffusion and dopant activation), etch, deposition, oxidation, and epitaxy. Other common steps include chemical-mechanical <b>planarization</b> (CMP), silicidation, and reflow.|$|E

50|$|If using glass, {{based on}} the high surface roughness, a chemical-mechanical <b>planarization</b> (CMP) step after rinsing is {{necessary}} to improve the bonding quality. The bond strength is characterized by fracture toughness determined by micro chevron tests. Plasma activated wafer bonds can achieve fracture toughnesses that are comparable to bulk material.|$|E
50|$|Methods, i.e. plasma surface pretreatment, {{provide an}} {{accelerated}} diffusion rate {{based on an}} increased surface contact. Also {{the use of an}} ultra <b>planarization</b> step is considered to improve the bonding due to a reduction of material transport required for the diffusion. This improvement is based on a defined height Cu, Au and Sn.|$|E
50|$|The company {{seeks to}} help {{manufacturers}} increase their yields by improving contamination control in several key processes, including photolithography, wet etching & cleaning, chemical-mechanical <b>planarization,</b> thin-film deposition, bulk chemical processing, wafer and reticle handling and shipping, and testing, assembly and packaging. Approximately 80% of the Company's products {{are used in}} the semiconductor industry.|$|E
50|$|Using {{incremental}} <b>planarization</b> for graph {{drawing is}} most effective when {{the first step of}} the process finds as large a planar graph as possible. Unfortunately, finding the planar subgraph with the maximum possible number of edges (the maximum planar subgraph problem) is NP-hard, and MaxSNP-hard, implying that there probably does not exist a polynomial time algorithm that solves the problem exactly or that approximates it arbitrarily well.|$|E
5000|$|The first type is {{distortion}} corrections, namely pre-compensating for distortions {{inherent in}} the manufacturing process, be it from a processing step, such as: photolithography, etching, <b>planarization,</b> and deposition. These distortions are measured and a suitable model fitted, compensation is carried out usually using a rule or model based algorithm. When applied to printing distortions during photolithography, this distortion compensation is known as Optical Proximity Correction (OPC).|$|E

In March 1997, the company purchased OnTrak Systems Inc., a chip equipment manufacturer that specialized in chemical-mechanical <b>planarization</b> (CMP) cleaning, for $225 Million. CMP cleaning is a hybrid process to smooth surfaces using both etching and mechanical polishing. In August 1997, the company named OnTrak's CEO Jim Bagley as its CEO. In 1998, Bagley was named chairman of the board.|$|E
50|$|The {{market for}} {{materials}} and equipment used to manufacture MEMS devices topped $1 billion worldwide in 2006. Materials demand is driven by substrates, making up over 70 percent of the market, packaging coatings and increasing use of chemical mechanical <b>planarization</b> (CMP). While MEMS manufacturing continues {{to be dominated by}} used semiconductor equipment, there is a migration to 200 mm lines and select new tools, including etch and bonding for certain MEMS applications.|$|E
50|$|Stacking layers {{produces}} NIMs at optical frequencies. However, {{the surface}} configuration (non-planar, bulk) of the SRR normally prevents stacking. Although a single-layer SRR structure {{can be constructed}} on a dielectric surface, it is relatively difficult to stack these bulk structures due to alignment tolerance requirements. A stacking technique for SRRs was published in 2007 that uses dielectric spacers to apply a <b>planarization</b> procedure to flatten the SRR layer. It appears that arbitrary many layers can be made this way, including any chosen number of unit cells and variant spatial arrangements of individual layers.|$|E
50|$|These two {{hydrogen}} bonds {{result in the}} drug forming an L-shape and fits in the S1 and S4 pockets. The amino acids residues Phe-174, Tyr-99, and Trp-215 form a narrow hydrophobic channel that is the S4 binding pocket. The morpholinone part of rivaroxaban is “sandwiched” between amino acids Tyr-99 and Phe-174 and the aryl ring of rivaroxaban is oriented perpendicularly across Trp-215. The morpholinone carbonyl group {{does not have a}} direct interaction to the FXa backbone, instead, it contributes to a <b>planarization</b> of the morpholinone ring and therefore supports rivaroxaban to be sandwiched between the two amino acids.|$|E
5000|$|Chen et al. {{designed}} {{a system that}} would undergo self-assembly by triggering changes in intermolecular interactions. They used an oxidation-induced <b>planarization</b> to trigger gelator self-assembly and gelation through donor-acceptor π-stacking interaction. The interesting part is that both strong oxidants such as cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate and weak oxidants like nitric oxide, NO can induce gelation. Figure 3 shows the oxidation of dihydropyridine catalyzed/induced by NO. NO {{has been used as}} an analyte or biomarker for disease detection, and the discovery of NO’s role in analyte-triggered gelation system no doubt has opened new doors to the world of chemical sensing.|$|E
