40|$|The fission yeast centromere, {{which is}} similar to {{metazoan}} centromeres, contains highly repetitive pericentromere sequences that are assembled into heterochromatin. This is required for the recruitment of cohesin and <b>proper</b> chromosome <b>segregation.</b> Surprisingly, the pericentromere replicates early in the S phase. Loss of heterochromatin causes this domain to become very sensitive to replication fork defects, leading to gross chromosome rearrangements. This review examines the interplay between components of DNA replication, heterochromatin assembly, and cohesin dynamics that ensures maintenance of genome stability and <b>proper</b> chromosome <b>segregation...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Security is {{the first}} and {{foremost}} concern in any SAP audit. There should be <b>proper</b> <b>segregation</b> of duties and access controls, which is paramount to establishing {{the integrity of the}} controls for the system. When a company first receives SAP it is almost devoid of all security measures. When implementing SAP a company must go through an extensive process of outlining their processes and then building their system security from the ground up to ensure <b>proper</b> <b>segregation</b> of duties and proper access. Proper profile design and avoidance of redundant user ID’s and superuser access will be important in all phases of operation. Along with this comes the importance of ensuring restricted access to terminals, servers, and the data center to prevent tampering. Because each company will have different modules each company’s security structure will be distinctly different.|$|E
50|$|Constitutive {{heterochromatin}} {{is found}} more commonly in {{the periphery of}} the nucleus attached to the nuclear membrane. This concentrates the euchromatic DNA {{in the center of the}} nucleus where it can be actively transcribed. During mitosis it is believed that constitutive heterochromatin is necessary for <b>proper</b> <b>segregation</b> of sister chromatids and centromere function. The repeat sequences found at the pericentromeres are not conserved throughout many species and depend more on epigenetic modifications for regulation, while telomeres show more conserved sequences.|$|E
50|$|Most human cancers {{have been}} found to have gains and losses of {{chromosomes}} that may be due to chromosomal instability (CIN). One of the things that cause CIN is the inactivation of genes that control the <b>proper</b> <b>segregation</b> of the sister chromatids during mitosis. In gaining a better understanding of survivin's function in mitotic regulation, scientists have looked into the area of genomic instability. It is known that survivin associates with microtubules of the mitotic spindle at the start of mitosis.|$|E
30|$|The {{success of}} meiosis {{depends on the}} {{regulation}} of several cellular processes that ensure <b>proper</b> chromosome <b>segregation.</b> By employing the immunolocalization technique {{it is possible to}} visualize a large number of proteins related to different aspects of meiosis, including sister chromatid cohesion, synapsis, recombination, and chromosome segregation (Yang et al. [2013]).|$|R

50|$|During mitosis {{chromosome}} segregation occurs routinely {{as a step}} in cell division (see mitosis diagram). As indicated in the mitosis diagram, mitosis is preceded by a round of DNA replication, so that each chromosome forms two copies called chromatids. These chromatids separate to opposite poles, a process facilitated by a protein complex referred to as cohesin. Upon <b>proper</b> <b>segregation,</b> {{a complete set of}} chromatids ends up in each of two nuclei, and when cell division is completed, each DNA copy previously referred to as a chromatid is now called a chromosome.|$|E
5000|$|Cohesin: The cohesin complex was {{initially}} discovered {{as a key}} player in mitosis, binding sister chromatids together to ensure <b>proper</b> <b>segregation.</b> However, cohesin has since been linked to many more functions within the cell. It has been found to help facilitate DNA repair and recombination, meiotic chromosome pairing and orientation, chromosome condensation, DNA replication, gene expression, and genome architecture. Cohesin is a heterodimer composed of the proteins SMC1 and SMC3 in combination with the SCC1 and SCC3 proteins. The entire complex is loaded onto DNA by the NIPBL-MAU2 complex in a ring-like fashion.|$|E

50|$|This gene encodes a kinase {{involved}} in spindle checkpoint function and chromosome segregation. The protein has been localized to the kinetochore and {{plays a role}} in the inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), delaying the onset of anaphase and ensuring <b>proper</b> chromosome <b>segregation.</b> Impaired spindle checkpoint function has been found in many forms of cancer.|$|R
50|$|During cell division, {{heterochromatin}} {{formation is}} required for <b>proper</b> chromosome <b>segregation.</b> PRC2/EED-EZH2 complex may also {{be involved in the}} recruitment of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which results in increased DNA methylation, another epigenetic layer of transcription repression. Specific genes that have been identified as targets of EZH2-mediated transcriptional repression include HOXA9, HOXC8, MYT1, CDKN2A and retinoic acid target genes.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanisms}} verifying {{that all}} the requirements to pass to the next phase in the cell cycle have been fulfilled are called checkpoints. All along the cell cycle, there are different checkpoints. The checkpoint ensuring that chromosome segregation is correct is termed spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), spindle checkpoint or mitotic checkpoint. During mitosis or meiosis, the spindle checkpoint prevents anaphase onset until all chromosomes are properly attached to the spindle. To achieve <b>proper</b> <b>segregation,</b> the two kinetochores on the sister chromatids must be attached to opposite spindle poles (bipolar orientation). Only this pattern of attachment will ensure that each daughter cell receives one copy of the chromosome.|$|E
50|$|The meiotic {{recombination}} checkpoint {{monitors the}} meiotic recombination during meiosis, and blocks the entry into metaphase I if the recombination is not efficiently processed. Meiotic recombination {{contributes to the}} cells in three different ways. First, to achieve <b>proper</b> <b>segregation,</b> each pair of homologous chromosomes must be linked to each other to maintain {{a certain level of}} tension between them. Such tension is supposed to help the assembly of spindles and generally depends on meiotic recombination. Secondly, meiotic recombination increases the genetic diversity of gametes, making them readily adapt to new environment. Thirdly, meiotic recombination is a DNA repair process that removes damages from the DNA passed on to gametes.|$|E
50|$|When {{you have}} a {{function}} that deals with money either incoming or outgoing {{it is very important}} to make sure that duties are segregated to minimize and hopefully prevent fraud. One of the key ways to ensure <b>proper</b> <b>segregation</b> of duties (SoD) from a systems perspective is to review individuals’ access authorizations. Certain systems such as SAP claim to come with the capability to perform SoD tests, but the functionality provided is elementary, requiring very time consuming queries to be built and is limited to the transaction level only with little or no use of the object or field values assigned to the user through the transaction, which often produces misleading results. For complex systems such as SAP, it is often preferred to use tools developed specifically to assess and analyze SoD conflicts and other types of system activity. For other systems or for multiple system formats you should monitor which users may have super user access to the system giving them unlimited access to all aspects of the system. Also, developing a matrix for all functions highlighting the points where <b>proper</b> <b>segregation</b> of duties has been breached will help identify potential material weaknesses by cross checking each employee’s available accesses. This is as important if not more so in the development function as it is in production. Ensuring that people who develop the programs are not the ones who are authorized to pull it into production is key to preventing unauthorized programs into the production environment where they can be used to perpetrate fraud.|$|E

50|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) is a molecular safe-guarding mechanism that governs <b>proper</b> chromosome <b>segregation</b> in eukaryotic cells.SAC inhibits progression into anaphase until all homologous chromosomes (bivalents, or tetrads) are properly aligned to the spindle apparatus.

50|$|The {{second stage}} at which {{segregation}} occurs during meiosis is prophase II (see meiosis diagram). During this stage, segregation occurs {{by a process}} similar to that during mitosis, except {{that in this case}} prophase II is not preceded by a round of DNA replication. Thus the two chromatids comprising each chromosome separate into different nuclei, so that each nucleus gets a single set of chromatids (now called chromosomes) and each nucleus becomes included in a haploid gamete (see stages following prophase II in the meiosis diagram). This segregation process is also facilitated by cohesin. Failure of <b>proper</b> <b>segregation</b> during prophase II can also lead to aneuploid gametes. Aneuploid gametes can undergo fertilization to form aneuploid zygotes and hence to serious adverse consequences for progeny.|$|E
5000|$|After {{ensuring}} that security {{is set up}} to ensure <b>proper</b> <b>segregation</b> of duties the next area of concern surrounding security is with regards to system changes. All companies should have three different systems: the development system, the test system, and the production system. All changes to production {{will need to be}} run through an approval process and be tested to ensure that they will function properly when introduced into the production system. The security around who can authorize a change and who can pull that change through into production is paramount to ensuring the security and integrity of the system. Review of this process and the people involved with it will be a key to the audit of the system. [...] The goal of auditing the access, steps and procedures for system updates is to ensure proper controls over change management of the system and to ensure that proper testing and authorization procedures are being used.|$|E
50|$|Centromere/kinetochore protein zw10 homolog is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the ZW10 gene.

40|$|<b>Proper</b> {{chromosome}} <b>segregation</b> {{relies on}} {{the action of the}} spindle checkpoint. Recent data have shown that the chromosomal passenger proteins survivin and Aurora B play an important auxiliary role in spindle checkpoint surveillance. Knock-down experiments in human cells indicate that the function of the survivin/Aurora B complex is required to correct improper microtubule-kinetochore interactions. Combined data of four different groups show that the survivin/Aurora B complex is not an integral component of the spindle checkpoint, but it enables the cell to communicate lack of tension back to the attached microtubules. Moreover, they show that the affinity of BubR 1 for kinetochores is directly influenced by the absence or presence of the survivin/Aurora B complex. These functions of the survivin/Aurora B complex are essential for chromosome biorientation, a prerequisite for <b>proper</b> chromosome <b>segregation.</b> As such, this complex {{plays an important role in}} the maintenance of a stable genome...|$|R

5000|$|Meiotic {{chromosomal}} crossover (CO) recombination {{facilitates the}} <b>proper</b> <b>segregation</b> of homologous chromosomes. This is because, {{at the end}} of meiotic prophase I, CO recombination provides a physical link that holds homologous chromosome pairs together. These linkages are established by chiasmata, which are the cytological manifestations of CO recombination. Together with cohesion linkage between sister chromatids, CO recombination may help ensure the orderly segregation of the paired homologous chromosomes to opposite poles. In support of this, a study of aneuploidy in single spermatozoa by whole genome sequencing found that, on average, human sperm cells with aneuploid autosomes exhibit significantly fewer crossovers than normal cells. [...] After the first chromosome segregation in meiosis I is complete, there is further chromosome segregation during the second equational division of meiosis II. Both proper initial segregation of chromosomes in prophase I and the next chromosome segregation during equational division in meiosis II are required to generate gametes with the correct number of chromosomes.|$|E

5000|$|With {{security}} it {{all starts}} at the beginning with the proper design and implementation of security and access measures for employees. For new employees {{it is important that}} their access is set up properly and that future access granted has proper approval. After the system has been implemented the control over system changes and the approval process required for it is vital to ensure the continued security and functionality of the system. Without proper security measures in place from start to finish there will be a material weakness in the controls of the system because of this there will likely be some level of fraud as well. Through security you are able to [...] who has access to what data and processes and ensure that there is sufficient segregation of duties so as to prevent someone from perpetrating fraud. One of the major advantages of SAP is that it can be programmed to perform various audit functions for you. One of the most important of those is for reviewing user access and using the system to cross check based on an access matrix to ensure that <b>proper</b> <b>segregation</b> is in place so a person with payment request access does not also have access to create a vendor.|$|E
40|$|<b>Proper</b> {{chromosome}} <b>segregation</b> during mitosis {{ensures the}} equal inheritance of parental DNA by two daughter cells. Errors in chromosome segregation result in aneuploidy, the inheritance of abnormal chromosome numbers. Aneuploidy is {{a characteristic of}} tumors cells; therefore, understanding the factors that cause chromosome missegregation will provide insight into carcinogenesis. Certain post-transcriptional histone modifications in centromeric and pericentromeric regions are associated with maintaining kinetochore integrity and ensuring <b>proper</b> chromosome <b>segregation.</b> However, whether loss or improper distribution of modifications directly or indirectly causes chromosome missegregation {{is yet to be}} determined. To compare the DNA content of mutated yeast strains relative to WT, FACS analyses were conducted to detect cells’ DNA content. Furthermore, as cells with inherent defects in chromosome segregation or kinetochore integrity will likely be hypersensitive to benomyl, a microtubule depolymerizing agent, relative to WT, benomyl growth assays were conducted. Mutants with defects in these assays were assessed for changes in histone composition at CEN 3 compared to WT by ChIP. FACS analyses indicated that acetylation at H 3 and the corresponding acetyltransferase (HAT) are necessary for maintaining proper DNA content, consistent with their being required for <b>proper</b> chromosome <b>segregation.</b> Furthermore, mutations lacking the catalytic subunit of an H 4 -specific HAT complex were hypersensitive to benomyl, implying the involvement of this HAT in chromosome segregation. Together, these findings suggest that defects in acetylation regulation and histone deposition may contribute to aneuploidy and identifies potential targets for the development of new cancer therapeutics focusing on aneuploidy, but future assays are necessary to provide further insight...|$|R
