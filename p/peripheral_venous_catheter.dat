40|$|AIMS: The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{accuracy}} and completeness in the recording of <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> before and after implementing a template in the electronic patient record in paediatric care. BACKGROUND: As a basis for quality improvement and research purposes and to ensure patient safety, accurate clinical data need to be easily accessible in patient records. Several studies have concluded that the relation between performed care and what is documented in patient records is poor. DESIGN: Before and after study. METHOD: The study took place at a large paediatric university hospital in Sweden. Inclusion criteria were patients who were admitted to one of the included wards, had one or several <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> and were available at the ward at the time for data collection. Data were collected by observations and record audits before and then four and 10 months after the introduction of a template for recording <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> in a structured and standardised way. RESULTS: A significant increase in <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> with complete recording was observed after as compared with before the intervention. The percentage of <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> with recording of any kind was relatively stable (85 - 93 %). The overall recording of <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> insertion did not improve, but there was an increase in the recording of side and size after the intervention. One of the 22 complications observed before the intervention was documented and none of the complications (n = 17 and n = 9) after. CONCLUSION: The electronic patient record did not provide accurate data on <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> in paediatric care neither before nor after the intervention. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Further efforts to increase the documentation of catheter-related complications are needed. Integrated decision support systems in electronic patient records that remind nurses to inspect <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> regularly could be one solution.

40|$|<b>Peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter</b> is used {{to access}} the venous system. It {{is one of the}} most {{commonly}} used invasive procedures in health care facilities. This procedure falls within the competence and daily tasks of nurses. Therefore this type of nursing care is susceptible to risk of proceeding routinely which might result in conscious or unconscious errors. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter</b> needs to be introduced into the patient's vein in the following cases: planned parenteral nutrition, infusion or transfusion therapy, application of intravascular medication or contrast media, rehydration, blood sampling (which can be performed immediately after introducing the <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter</b> and before administrating medication) and also during an emergency care for critically ill (such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Nurses should be as knowledgeable as possible about this issue so that the <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter</b> can be introduced well and fulfil its purpose. It is important to ensure that nurses obtain all the necessary information about their patients before inserting the catheter and that they are able to properly inform the patients about the procedure and to communicate with them. Next, nurses should be familiar with the correct procedure for inserting catheters, they should be informed about possible contraindications and know how to choose the correct type of catheter as well as where to place it. Furthermore, nurses should care for this vascular access correctly and provide the patient with enough information about taking care of the catheter after the procedure. Finally, nurses should be aware of their own potential errors and also of possible complications. Therefore they should employ aseptic technique so that they can eliminate nosocomial infections. The thesis is divided into a theoretical and an empirical part. The theoretical part focuses on the history of peripheral venous catheters and their types, indications and contraindications, necessary equipment, nursing care, complications, etc. The empirical part consists of a research. The aim of the thesis was to map the use of peripheral venous catheters in hospitals as well as to identify factors that may lead to problems among the patients with peripheral venous catheters. Four research questions were assigned to these aims. 1. What is the procedure prior to inserting a <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter?</b> 2. What are the standards of caring for patients with an inserted <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter?</b> 3. In which steps of caring for peripheral venous catheters do the nurses lack knowledge? What equipment do the nurses prepare in order to insert a <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter?</b> The Bachelor's thesis was conducted using a qualitative research survey. The methods of collecting data included semi-structured interviews and participant observations. The research was carried out only in one hospital ward and it was anonymous. First, the data were collected by means of a semi-structured interview. The nurses were asked 14 questions (see Appendix 8). During this interview, several more subquestions were added. The results of the interviews were then grouped into several categories for the sake of clarity. The second method of collecting data was participant observation. The observed facts were recorded into an observation sheet (see Appendix 9). The same nurses who were interviewed were also observed. This Bachelor's thesis has been written in order to provide a basic overview of the peripheral venous catheters. It could be used as an information source for more experienced as well as novice nurses. The practical output of this Bachelor's thesis is a nursing care standard concerning peripheral venous catheters. This standard was missing in the hospital ward and could help the nurses to take care of these vascular accesses, to proceed correctly and eliminate possible errors (see Appendix 10) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: to {{evaluate}} the use of <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> based on microbiological analysis of devices (dressing and three-way stopcocks) and thus contribute to the prevention and infection control. Methods: this was a prospective study of microbiological analysis of 30 three-way stopcocks (external surfaces and lumens) and 30 dressing used in maintaining the <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> of hospitalized adult patients. Results: all external surfaces, 40 % of lumens, and 86. 7 % of dressing presented bacterial growth. The main species isolated in the lumen were 50 % coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 14. 3 % Staphylococcus aureus, and 14. 3 % Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fifty nine percent of multidrug-resistant bacteria were isolated of the three-way stopcocks, 42 % of the lumens, and 44 % of the dressing with a predominance of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus resistant to methicillin. Besides, 18 % gram-negative bacteria with resistance to carbapenems were identified from multidrug-resistant bacteria on the external surfaces of the three-way stopcocks.

Evaluation of the questionnaires revealed that there was {{a significant increase in the}} incidence of complications in line with an increasing duration of the indwelling period of between 24 and 96 hours. The unexpected finding of this evaluation study was that in the case of catheters with an indwelling period of more than two days there were highly significantly lower complication rates in those cases in which hand disinfection was carried out or gloves donned before catheter placement. The second study, based on the former, documented the cases giving rise to complications. The proportion of <b>peripheral</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> implicated in complications was 24 %.

Catheters placed in the OR during the patient’s hospital stay showed a significantly lower risk of complications than those inserted on wards, or even in the outpatient department. Conductance of hygienic hand disinfection or the wearing of disposable gloves resulted in significantly lower complication rates compared to normal handwashing or omission of a hand hygiene measure. The most plausible explanation for this positive effect exerted by the wearing of disposable gloves or conductance of hygienic hand disinfection prior to catheter placement is that there was no recontamination during repalpation, as often seen, of the prepared venepuncture site...|$|R
