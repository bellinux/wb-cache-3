2500|$|In Suzdal, Rubin was {{subjected}} to a cramped <b>punishment</b> <b>cell</b> barely bigger than a man and to the torture of solitary confinement.

Following a show trial conducted by prosecutor Nikolai Krylenko, Rubin was found guilty of participation in the plot and sentenced to a 5-year term of imprisonment. This coerced testimony of Rubin was used in building a case against his former employer, David Riazanov.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} half of December 1943, the then 26 Soviet Russian internees were sent along with other detainees, among others from England, Italy and Poland, to fetch wood in the forest. They were {{accompanied}} by several guards with dogs who ordered the soldiers to collect significantly more wood than normal and take it to the prison camp, [...] from the forest. The Russian internees refused to comply with this harassment, and the guard fired his gun into the air and rushed the dogs on his prisoners.

The gallows chamber, built in 1888, is between this and the main cell block and relates to the colonial use of the prison. The gallows operated via a rope tied around a beam, over a trap door, on the upper level. Opening the trap door would cause the condemned prisoner fall, and thus be hanged.|$|R

The eternally cold nights spent in <b>punishment</b> <b>cells.</b> The rats, the cockroaches, the spiders...and most of all the swarm of mosquitoes that drained my blood every second of my ephemeral existence in that hell.” He described the food: “the burundanga, that main course composed, so they say, of animal guts, but which everyone knows contains skull, brain and even excrement,” and the “rotten tenca, the fish that resembled a magnet covered with pins when it was served to us.” ...|$|R

50|$|The MUTE's neoclassical {{building}} was originally {{designed and built}} as a prison in 1902 by architect José Jeréz; who also designed most of Santa Tecla's landmarks.

The original prison had 4 major cells to house 15 inmates each; however records show that up to 40 inmates were held in each of the cells. In addition, the prison had 6 small <b>punishment</b> <b>cells</b> and 4 additional rooms 2 for the kitchen and 2 for special punishment prisoners, one of them named “the little one”, where no sound or light could be heard or seen.

5000|$|A {{standing}} cell is {{a special}} cell constructed so as to prevent the prisoner from doing anything but stand.

50|$|According to {{a former}} prisoner, an average of 500 prisoners die annually, mostly due to {{waterborne}} illnesses. Another former prisoner reported high death rates due to work accidents, malnutrition, and disease. Seriously ill prisoners are sent home on sick leave to reduce the apparent number of deaths in detention. In the limestone quarries the prisoners have to do hard labor in hazardous conditions, with prisoners often receiving or sustaining chest ailments and lung diseases from limestone dust. Moreover, as the prisoners are rarely allowed to wash their faces, many suffer from skin abrasions and infections. Prisoners live in unsanitary conditions; they sleep {{on the floor in}} groups of 50 to 100 people, without bathing or changing their clothes. Food rations consist of only 50 g (2 oz) of corn and wheat and some cabbage soup per meal and all prisoners are seriously underweight. A former prisoner witnessed eight public executions during the eight months he was held in the camp. Rule violations are punished with reduced rations, extended sentences, and detainment in very small <b>punishment</b> <b>cells.</b> There is a criticism session every week, in which the prison officials criticize prisoners in front of a large group of prisoners.|$|R

However, later on, Yonoi becomes enraged by Celliers' behaviour and has him and Lawrence thrown into the <b>punishment</b> <b>cells</b> under the charge of possessing a radio. Celliers, who is known by the nickname of [...] "Strafer" [...] Jack (a strafer is a [...] "soldier's soldier"), instigates {{a small number of}} rebellious actions, one of which is supplying the men with food after their rations have been suspended for two days for their actions during a seppuku of a Korean guard, which Yonoi deems as [...] "spiritually lazy". Yonoi's batman (personal servant) suspects the mental hold that Celliers has on Yonoi so he tries to kill Celliers but fails in the attempt. Celliers manages to escape his cell and rescues Lawrence, only to be thwarted by Yonoi unexpectedly. Yonoi challenges Celliers to single combat saying [...] "If you defeat me, you will be free" [...] but Celliers refuses, thrusting his prior assailant's bayonet into the sand. Yonoi's batman then commits seppuku in atonement after urging Yonoi to kill Celliers before Celliers can destroy Yonoi.|$|R
