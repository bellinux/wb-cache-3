As polymer sealants, 4 kinds of resins (silicone, cyanoacryl resin, epoxy <b>resin</b> and <b>polyamide</b> <b>resin)</b> were used. The first three sealants were soaked into the porous coating layers after dilution by organic solvents, while the thermoplastic <b>polyamide</b> <b>resin</b> was melted and then penetrated into them.

The adsorption of bilirubin by the pendants on the Merrifield resin was minimal while PVP and cholestyramine adsorbed some bilirubin. However, the best adsorbents were the immobilized amino acids on a water swellable polyamide resin. A systematic study {{of the effect of}} the changes in the amino acid composition of the pendant, both in type and number, on the adsorption by the <b>polyamide</b> <b>resins</b> indicates that the change density, contributed by the R groups of the amino acids in the pendant, is the major factor in the adsorption process. However, some adsorption also occurs at the (alpha) -amino groups. Effects due to the conformation of the peptide chains are also indicated. Of the resins studied, those with peptide pendants containing arginine or lysine form the most efficient adsorbents for bilirubin in aqueous buffer solution. Studies of the adsorption of bilirubin from bilirubin solutions containing bovine serum albumin as well as studies of desorption of bilirubin from the resins by bovine serum albumin indicates that some resins containing arginine in the pendants can successfully compete with albumin.

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{investigated}} the effect of laser parameters and air-abrasion on the peel strength of silicon-based soft denture liner to different denture resins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens (N= 180) were prepared out of three different denture base resins (Rodex, cross-linked denture base acrylic resin; Paladent, heat-cured acrylic resin; Deflex, Polyamide resin) (75 mm × 25 mm × 3 mm). A silicon-based soft denture liner (Molloplast B) {{was applied to the}} denture resins after the following conditioning methods: a) Air-abrasion (50 µm), b) Er,Cr:YSGG laser (Waterlase MD Turbo, Biolase Technology) at 2 W- 20 Hz, c) Er,Cr:YSGG laser at 2 W- 30 Hz, d) Er,Cr:YSGG laser at 3 W- 20 Hz, e) Er,Cr:YSGG laser at 3 W- 30 Hz. Non-conditioned group acted as the control group. Peel test was performed in a universal testing machine. Failure modes were evaluated visually. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (α=. 05). RESULTS: Denture liner tested showed increased peel strength after laser treatment with different parameters (3. 9 ± 0. 4 - 5. 58 ± 0. 6 MPa) compared to the control (3. 64 ± 0. 5 - 4. 58 ± 0. 5 MPa) and air-abraded groups (3. 1 ± 0. 6 - 4. 46 ± 0. 3 MPa), but the results were not statistically significant except for Paladent, with the pretreatment of Er,Cr:YSGG laser at 3 W- 20 Hz. Polyamide resin after air-abrasion showed significantly lower peel strength than those of other groups (3. 1 ± 0. 6 MPa). CONCLUSION: Heat-cured acrylic resin, PMMA, may benefit from Er,Cr:YSGG laser treatment at 3 W- 20 Hz irradiation. Air-abrasion of <b>polyamide</b> <b>resins</b> should be avoided not to impair their peel bond strengths to silicon-based soft denture liners...|$|E

The materials used were polypropylene and <b>polyamide</b> <b>resins</b> with glass fibres and talc as fillers. These materials were provided by PLASTAMID (pty) ltd. The injection moulded specimens of polypropylene, polyamide 6 - 6, 30 % talc filled polypropylene, 30 % short glass fibre reinforced polypropylene and 30 % short glass fibre reinforced polyamide 6 - 6 were tested in tension, flexure and impact (lzod, Charpy and drop-weight). Two different injection-moulding machines were used for specimen manufacture. These were an automated injection moulding machine simulating good control of processing conditions and a simple hand operated injection moulding machine simulating different processing and cooling (crystallisation) conditions. The mechanical tests were performed at different rates of strain and temperatures. The mechanical results show higher ductility of the unfilled polypropylene material. The strength and the elastic modulus of the materials are different for different materials. Addition of short glass fibres enhances the mechanical properties of polypropylene and polyamide 6 - 6. Talc fillers reduce the tensile, Izod and Charpy impact properties of polypropylene while the flexural and dropweight impact strength is increased. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to observe the microstructural features and deformation behaviour such as matrix plastic deformation, matrix crazing and tearing, fibre-matrix debonding, fibre fracture, fibre orientation and crack propagation. These deformation behaviours {{are influenced by the}} test conditions such as strain rate, temperature and the type of the test conducted. The deformation behaviour is also dependent on the constituents of the material. The mechanical test response together with the macro- and microscopic features observed on the fracture surfaces of tested specimens are evidence of the various mechanisms of failure that take place in different thermoplastic composites. The understanding of the mechanical response and the failure mechanisms of thermoplastic matrix composites is important in the design and processing stages...|$|E

The Polyamide isolated fractions of Marion berries contained four quercetin glycosides, one kaempferol glycoside, three acylated quercetin glycosides, (-) -epicatechin, and eight ellagic acid derivatives. Polyamide isolated fractions of Marion seeds had several procyanidins (including (+) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin), 11 tentative ellagitannins, and eight ellagic acid derivatives. (-) -Epicatechin and ellagic acid derivatives {{were the primary}} phenolics in blackberry fruits and seeds. Flavonols were the major component in whole berries, while procyanidins and ellagic acid derivatives were the primary phenolics in seeds. No flavonols were found in seeds. The phenolic profiles of Marion and Evergreen were qualitatively similar. Evergreen berries contained higher level of (-) -epicatechin, ellagic acid derivatives, and flavonols than Marion berries. Evergreen seeds were also higher in procyanidin content than Marion seeds, while Marion seeds were higher in ellagic acid derivatives. No ascorbic acid was found in any extracts. The total monomeric anthocyanin content of Marion berries (225 mg of Cyanidin 3 -glucoside/ 100 g) was 1. 5 times {{higher than that of}} Evergreen berries (154 mg/ 100 g). However, the total phenolics, total monomeric anthocyanins, oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) values of Marion and Evergreen berries were not statistically different at the significance level 0. 05.
