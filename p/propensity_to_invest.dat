Eliminating return on capital with interest-free loans along with zakat, and profit-share would restore this balance. The focus shifts to the entrepreneur whose activity becomes {{the only source of}} income along with wages, giving him the upper hand in society.

He also argued that at the peaks and troughs of the cycle the marginal <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> shift. The intuition behind this is that at the trough of the cycle there will be a large amount of excess capacity and so businessmen will not want to invest more, while {{at the peak of the}} cycle rising costs will discourage investment.

We test this claim by comparing the <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> of subnational vis-à-vis national governments. 2) The administrative and efficiency costs of earmarking grants for capital use are justified by their effect of inducing additional investments by subnational governments.

When firms with large public pension fund presence do acquire other firms, they perform relatively better in the long-run. Other institutional investors have either the opposite effect or no effect. Identifying the sources of exogenous variation in institutional ownership is crucial to establish the direction of causality between institutional ownership and observed corporate merger and acquisition decisions. This paper introduces two new approaches. First, I decompose the institutional ownership into one component which is correlated with future M&A shocks, and the noise component which is not.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{macroeconomic}} model with New Keynesian features which endogenously generates dynamic paths of income and the stock of corporate debt of a cyclic and chaotic nature. From the market clearing condition on goods and money markets we derive the dynamic paths of income and corporate debt whose stability properties depend upon the <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> out {{of the flow of}} internally generated funds, which in turn is a positive function of income. If it is relatively ‘low’, the dynamic paths on income and corporate debt converge to their steady-state long-run values. When the <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> is neither too ‘low’ nor too ‘high’, the system can exhibit either bounded cycles or chaotic dynamics.

40|$|In the literature, {{attention}} has been paid to the environmental consequences of lower energy prices caused by market liberalisation: the drop in energy prices reduces the attractiveness of investing in energy-saving technologies. In this paper we develop a simple model of investment decision-making emphasising the importance of not only levels but also volatility of energy prices for actual investment behaviour. The general finding is that lower energy prices and higher uncertainty reduce the <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest.</b> To empirically assess the importance of changes in both levels and volatility, we use US natural gas price data over the market liberalisation period and apply the information to the investment decision with respect to a specific energy-saving technology in the paper industry.

We investigate two types of social capital: membership in groups, or 'formal' social capital, and size of trust-based networks or 'informal' social capital. Because men and women may have different <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in social capital, we analyse the determinants of group membership {{for men and women}} separately. We also disaggregate the analysis by type of group. The paper also examines the determinants of the density of social capital, proxied by the number of groups and the number of network members. Finally, it explores whether groups contribute to increased sizes of social networks. We find that men and women do not differ significantly in their probability of participating in groups or the number of groups they join. However, there are clear gender differences in the types of groups to which men and women belong. We also find that group membership does not, in general, increase network density. The size of one's informal networks is influenced by the location and migration decisions of one's sons and daughters, suggesting that sons and daughters play different roles in providing support to their households of origin.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} the employer in workplace training, a novelty with respect to the literature on this topic. Taking advantage of a unique dataset on Italy, we study how individual employer profile and the agglomeration of employers influence firms‟ <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in training. Our findings show that highly educated employers have a greater <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in workplace training. Moreover, we are able to capture the effect of employers‟ human capital agglomeration on the training decision. We assert that such agglomeration leads to two different alternative scenarios: 1) a poaching effect may prevail, therefore competition among employers induces less propensity to train workers; 2) a positive knowledge spillover effect may prevail leading to a greater propensity to engage in training. We test these two options discovering that in the Italian case, where small businesses are prominent, the first effect is stronger. Several econometrics issues are considered in our empirical strategy: the skewed and bounded nature of the training decision indicator, the endogeneity issues derived from the agglomeration effect as well as the cross section dependence problems affecting standard errors...|$|E

40|$|The {{positive}} impact of intangible assets on several measures of economic performance {{is well documented}} in the literature. Less clear is what leads firms to invest in intangible assets in the first place. The latter is particularly important since, {{at least for the}} Italian manufacturing sector, firms exhibit a very strong heterogeneity in their level of intangible asset investments. In line with the capability-based theory of the firm we argue that the firm’s <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in intangible assets can be explained by factors that are internal and specific to the firm. Making use of a rich dataset we test and provide support for our hypotheses. In particular we find that the <b>propensity</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in intangible assets increases with the firm’s size, human capital and organizational complexity and with the past level of intangible assets. This points toward the existence of a cumulative dynamics in the process of intangible assets accumulation that may account for most of the heterogeneity observed in the data. The paper adds to the previous literature in two ways: first it highlights the existence of a strong intra-industry heterogeneity in intangible assets investments; and second, it offers an explanation for such heterogeneity. : intangible assets, human capital, firms heterogeneity, organizational complexity, complementarity, knowledge economy, organizational capabilities...|$|E

We investigate two types of social capital: membership in groups (production, credit, burial, religious and civic groups), or “formal” social capital, and size of trust-based networks or “informal” social capital. Because men and women may have different <b>propensities</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in social capital, we analyze {{the determinants of}} group membership both at the household level and {{for men and women}} separately. We also disaggregate the analysis by type of group. The paper examines the determinants of the density of social capital, proxied by the number of groups and the number of network members. Finally, it explores various reasons why people might join groups—whether groups increase trust, or whether groups increase well-being, as proxied by per capita expenditure. We find that asset-rich, better-educated households and households living closer to town centers are more likely to participate in groups and to have larger social and economic assistance networks. Different aspects of village-level heterogeneity have different impacts on group membership, and greater exposure to shocks and a higher incidence of peace and order problems increase group membership. Men and women do not differ significantly in the number of groups they join, however, there are clear gender differences in the types of groups to which men and women belong. We also find that group membership does not, in general, increase network density and we do not find evidence of positive returns to group membership in terms of increased per capita expenditures.
