5000|$|A serious {{limitation}} of norm-reference tests {{is that the}} reference group may not represent the current population of interest. As noted by the Oregon Research Institute's International Personality Item Pool website, [...] "One should be very wary of using canned [...] "norms" [...] because it isn't obvious that one could ever find a population of which one's <b>present</b> <b>sample</b> is a representative subset. Most [...] "norms" [...] are misleading, and therefore {{they should not be}} used. Far more defensible are local norms, which one develops oneself. For example, if one wants to give feedback to members of a class of students, one should relate the score of each individual to {{the means and standard deviations}} derived from the class itself. To maximize informativeness, one can provide the students with the frequency distribution for each scale, based on these local norms, and the individuals can then find (and circle) their own scores on these relevant distributions." ...|$|E

The INAH3 size of homosexual men was {{the same as that of}} women. LeVay wrote that [...] "This finding indicates that INAH is dimorphic with sexual orientation, at least in men, and suggests that sexual orientation has a biological substrate." [...] LeVay added, [...] "The existence of 'exceptions' in the <b>present</b> <b>sample</b> (that is, presumed heterosexual men with small INAH 3 nuclei, and homosexual men with large ones), hints at the possibility that sexual orientation, although an important variable, may not be the sole determinant of INAH 3 size.

40|$|The {{portability}} of the Standard Shiftwork Index (SSI) and {{the impact}} of shiftwork was assessed on a sample of television production employees in Auckland, New Zealand. Sixty three respondents completed the SSI and reported a moderate impact of shiftwork on physical and psychological health and moderately high sleep disturbance. Social and domestic life yielded the greatest detrimental impact. Gender related coping strategies was the only significant difference within the sample. Chronic fatigue, somatic anxiety, general job satisfaction and disengagement were significantly related to intention to leave the organisation. Statistical analysis of effect size indicated equivalent levels of power in both the U. K and the <b>present</b> <b>sample.</b> Overall, the results for the <b>present</b> <b>sample</b> were comparable to the U.

30|$|The {{internal}} consistency of the DBVS was assessed using Cronbach α and Composite Reliability (CR). Cronbach α for the 19 items composing the scale was 0.829 and no significant improvements were found excluding any item. Following the indications of Fornell and Larcker (1981), the {{internal consistency}} of the scale was also examined using CR, which in the <b>present</b> <b>sample</b> was 0.90. Finally, the item/domain discriminating power was assessed through the corrected item-total correlations. All the items were significantly (p[*]≤[*] 0.001) and positively related with the total score, with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.20 and 0.52, although more than 2 / 3 of the items presented coefficients ≥ 0.40. These results strongly support the adequacy and reliability of the single-factor solution of the DBVS in the <b>present</b> <b>sample.</b>|$|E

Isotope, major element, and trace element compositions of these basalts indicate that the <b>present</b> <b>samples</b> include distinctive HIMU (high micron - high 238 U/ 204 Pb) and normal non-HIMU basalts. Examination based on Ni-Mg-Fe partitioning between olivine and liquid suggests an only minor effect of accumulation of phenocrysts in governing the compositional variations of the <b>present</b> <b>samples.</b> The fractionation trends obtained show monotonic decrease and increase in noble-metal elements with decreasing MgO content n HIMU and non-HIMU basalts, respectively. These characteristic trends indicate that HIMU magmas are differentiated by fractional crystallization and have higher sulfide/silicate ratios than non-HIMU basalts. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
