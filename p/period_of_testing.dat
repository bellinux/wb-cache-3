5|$|Python 3.0 (initially {{described}} as Python 3000 or py3k), is a major, backward-incompatible release that was released {{after a long}} <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> on 3 December 2008.

25|$|The {{original}} {{launch date}} for Luas {{was to be}} 2003, but delays in construction saw this date pushed back by a year. An advertising campaign took place {{to inform the public}} of the development of the system, while construction was taking place. Construction finished in February 2004 and a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> and driver training began. 30 June 2004 was decided on as the official launch date of the Green Line. The first tram went into service for the general public at 3 p.m. Several days of free travel and a family fun weekend took place to launch the system. The Red Line opened on 26 September 2004, with six days of free travel for the general public.|$|E
25|$|Mansell {{became a}} {{financial}} stakeholder and a {{driver in the}} new Grand Prix Masters series. Following a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> and developing the car, Mansell made a successful race comeback by winning the inaugural race of the series in Kyalami in November 2005 (Mansell had won at the old Kyalami circuit in 1985 and had also won at the new circuit in 1992). After {{the success of the}} race at Kyalami, four dates were scheduled for the GP Masters Series in 2006, including one at Silverstone. Mansell won the season opener at Qatar in April from pole position. The Monza round of the series was cancelled due to noise limitations at the venue, whilst technical issues quickly ruled him out of the Silverstone race.|$|E

25|$|Olfactory memory deficits can be {{significant}} indicators of brain damage and pathology. There is {{evidence to suggest}} that certain mental disorders not only produce olfactory deficits but also predict them. Evidence has been found for a number of disorders, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, alcoholic Korsakoff's syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. In animal research certain brain altering drugs such as anti-depressants produce deficits in olfactory memory. In testing the effects of anti-depressants on olfactory sensitivity in mice, the “mice were tested in a Y-maze with a choice between an odorant (butanol) or distilled water before and during 3 weeks of dailyintra-peritoneal injection of either citalopram or clomipramine. Their performance was compared with those of a control group injected with a saline solution” and the results were that significant olfactory deficits were found during the three-week <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{new version}} of the {{sandwich}} was originally made with two of the chain's [...] hamburger patties, but after negative consumer response regarding the size of the patties the sandwich was reformulated to use two [...] Whopper Jr. patties instead. A chicken variant was introduced in May 2014. The new chicken variant swapped out the burger patties with two chicken patties used for the chain's value menu chicken sandwiches and added a third layer of sauce to increase the moisture content of the sandwich. The sandwich was introduced nationwide in the U.S. after a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> in Indiana. While the chicken version of the sandwich was new to Burger King, it again copied a product from McDonald's—in the Middle East the competing chain offers a Chicken Big Mac sandwich.|$|E
2500|$|After {{extensive}} {{analysis by}} the engineers, the problem was fixed by the retrofitting of 37 fluid-viscous dampers (energy dissipating) to control horizontal movement and 52 tuned mass dampers (inertial) to control vertical movement. This took from May 2001 to January 2002 and cost £5M. After a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing,</b> the bridge was successfully reopened on 22 February 2002. The bridge has not been subject to significant vibration since. In spite of the successful fix of the problem, the affectionate [...] "wobbly bridge" [...] epithet remains in common usage among Londoners.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to {{describe}} the emission of a serious painful symptomatology in a 57 years patient that suffered from low back pain and pain to the inferior limbs for several years. The pain {{was a result of}} surgical treatment (Failed Back Surgery Syndrome, FBSS) and the gravity of the symptoms had negatively influenced the patient's quality of life. The pain, nociceptive and neuropathic, was resistant to several therapeutic approaches (pharmacological or not). Also a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> with dorsal spinal cord stimulation (SCS) was ineffective. After careful analysis, the patient has been submitted to <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> with ziconotide intrathecally administered. The result that surpassed all one's expectations, was a remarkable reduction of the pain. Such reduction allowed the patient to totally recover its autonomy and clearly improve the quality of life...|$|R

40|$|Recently, a {{new method}} has been {{proposed}} to detect the onset of neuromuscular fatigue during an incremental cycling test by assessing the changes in spectral electromyographic (sEMG) frequencies within individual exercise <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> the <b>test.</b> The method consists on determining the highest power output that can be sustained without {{a significant decrease in}} spectral frequencies. This study evaluated the validity of the new approach by assessing the changes in spectral indicators both throughout the whole test and within individual exercise <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> the <b>test.</b> Fourteen cyclists performed incremental cycle ergometer rides to exhaustion with bipolar surface EMG signals recorded from the vastus lateralis. The mean and median frequencies (Fmean and Fmedian, respectively) of the sEMG power spectrum were calculated. The main findings were: (1) Examination of spectral indicators within individual exercise <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> the <b>test</b> showed that neither Fmean nor Fmedian decreased significantly during the last (most fatiguing) exercise <b>periods.</b> (2) Examination <b>of</b> the whole incremental test showed that the behaviour of Fmean and Fmedian with increasing power output was highly inconsistent and varied greatly among subjects. (3) Over the whole incremental <b>test,</b> half <b>of</b> the participants exhibited a positive relation between spectral indicators and workload, whereas the other half demonstrated the opposite behavior. Collectively, these findings indicate that spectral sEMG indexes do not provide a reliable measure of the fatigue state of the muscle during an incremental cycling test. Moreover, it is concluded that {{it is not possible to}} determine the onset of neuromuscular fatigue during an incremental cycling test by examining spectral indicators within individual exercise <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> the <b>test...</b>|$|R
