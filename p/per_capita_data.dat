The basic theory is that presidential candidates pledge more federal spending per capita to these states because doing well in their contests is critical to capturing the nomination.

Using by-state procurement <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>data</b> from 1984 to 2004, four conditional hypotheses derived from this thinking are tested.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} assumptions of economics are utility maximization and weak separability of the arguments in the represen tative consumer's utility function. This paper contains results from nonparametric tests of these assumptions about consumer behavior. The authors find that quarterly <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> <b>data</b> on consumption goods, le isure, and monetary assets are consistent with utility maximization. Further, consumption goods and leisure meet necessary and sufficient conditions for weak separability. Additionally, one grouping of relat ively liquid monetary assets meets the necessary conditions for weak separability. They also test and find no evidence of homothetic prefe rences.
