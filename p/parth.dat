5|$|Many filmed scenes remain unused, {{even in the}} Extended Editions. Promotional {{material}} for The Fellowship of the Ring contained an attack by Orcs from Moria on Lothlórien after the Fellowship leaves Moria, replaced with a more suspenseful entrance for the Fellowship. Also cut were scenes from the book, including Frodo seeing more of Middle-earth at <b>Parth</b> Galen and an extended Council of Elrond, and new scenes with an attack upon Frodo and Sam at the river Anduin by an Uruk-hai. The major cut to The Two Towers featured Arwen and Elrond visiting Galadriel at Lothlórien, with Arwen then leading the Elven reinforcements to Helm's Deep. This scene, and a flashback to Arwen and Aragorn's first meeting, was cut during a revision of the film's plot; the Elves' appearance was explained with a telepathic communication between Elrond and Galadriel.|$|E

5|$|Saruman is in {{part the}} {{architect}} of his own downfall. Kocher, Randall Helms and Shippey write that Saruman's actions {{in the first half}} of The Two Towers, although intended to further his own interests, in fact lead to his defeat and that of Sauron: his orcs help split the Fellowship at <b>Parth</b> Galen, and in carrying off two of the hobbits initiate a series of incidents that lead to his ruin. In turn this frees the Rohirrim to intervene at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and then together with the men of Gondor to assault Sauron's stronghold of Mordor and distract him from Frodo's final effort to destroy the Ring. Shippey says that this demonstrates the value of persistence in the face of despair, even if a way out cannot be seen; Kocher and Helms write that it is part of a pattern of providential events and of the reversed effects of evil intentions throughout the book.|$|E

Lady Galadriel's mirror reveals to her and the player that the Fellowship faced a grave danger at <b>Parth</b> Galen, but many things remain unclear. Galadriel bids the player and Nona to travel further down the river of Anduin to discover the Fellowship's fate, sending with them guide - an Elf named Corudan, whose sister Sigileth fought alongside the player in Mirkwood and perished during the battle in Dol Guldur. The Fellowship makes a brief stop at the Rohirrim town of Stangard, where the player discovers that Horn, the man who helped carry wounded Nona into Lothlorien, is no longer welcome by other men for venturing into the woods they consider haunted. His future uncertain, Horn accepts the offer to join the player's quest. Together with an Elf, a man of Rohan and a girl from Dunland, the player travels by boat south down Anduin, eventually reaching the Argonath. On the lawn of <b>Parth</b> Galen, they find signs of the Fellowship's passing and a struggle and are eventually able {{to piece together the}} events leading to the Breaking of the Fellowship.

25|$|By 13 September, the battalion, {{continuing}} {{to support the}} infantry regiments, had closed up to the Moselle River near Thionville. On this date, a gun from the 2nd platoon, C Company, located 200 yards west of Basse <b>Parth,</b> fired ten rounds into Germany, targeting the church steeple in Perl. These were the first rounds fired by the 90th into Germany, first rounds fired by the XX Corps into Germany and it {{is believed to have}} been the first fire to fall into Germany from the Third Army.

40|$|Structural {{analyses}} of ice {{obtained from the}} bare ice surface around the S∅r Rondane Mountains, where more than 2000 meteorites were collected, were carried out. Ice fabrics, cracks, and crystals in the samples were investigated to determine the strain accumulated in ice along their particle <b>parths,</b> and to determine the stress/strain configuration of the ice sheet around the mountains standing in the ice sheet. In the area which is near the side wall of the mountains, single maximum fabric pattern was observed, and the axis of single maximum lay roughly perpendicular to the flow line. It is deduced from the observation results that the ice sheet is widely subjected to vertical shear strain there. Shear strain is caused due to shear stress between ice flow and side wall of the nunatak. In Nansenisen which is up-stream from the mountains, {{it was found that}} observed fabric patterns could be classified into two types. One is single maximum pattern and the axis of single maximum lies in the longitudinal direction. The other is great circle girdle pattern, and the girdles are on the horizontal plane. Great circle girdle patterns were observed in the area where high concentration of moraines and meteorites was observed. Since only similar two types of fabric have ever been observed in other meteorite ice fields, each type is a principal fabric patterns in the meteorite ice field. This means there are two principal types of stress/strain configuration there. Configuration of accumulated strain in ice was deduced. The meaning of such strain related to the concentration mechanism of meteorites and moraines is discussed...|$|R
