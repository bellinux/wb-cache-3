The CMB has a thermal black body spectrum at a temperature of [...] The spectral radiance dEν/dν peaks at 160.23GHz, in the microwave range of frequencies. The photon energy of CMB photons is about 6.626534 × 10−4 eV. Alternatively, if spectral radiance is defined as dEλ/dλ, then the <b>peak</b> <b>wavelength</b> is 1.063mm. The glow is very nearly uniform in all directions, but the tiny residual variations show a very specific pattern, {{the same as that}} expected of a fairly uniformly distributed hot gas that has expanded to the current size of the universe. In particular, the spectral radiance at different angles of observation in the sky contains small anisotropies, or irregularities, which vary with the size of the region examined. They have been measured in detail, and match what would be expected if small thermal variations, generated by quantum fluctuations of matter in a very tiny space, had expanded {{to the size of the}} observable universe we see today. This is a very active field of study, with scientists seeking both better data (for example, the Planck spacecraft) and better interpretations of the initial conditions of expansion. Although many different processes might produce the general form of a black body spectrum, no model other than the Big Bang has yet explained the fluctuations. As a result, most cosmologists consider the Big Bang model of the universe to be the best explanation for the CMB.|$|E
