40|$|Pd/H-Beta {{catalysts}} {{with different}} silica-to-alumina ratio prepared by an impregnation method {{have been studied}} by XANES/EXAFS, IR, XRD and TEM. It was shown that palladium in calcined Pd/H-Beta samples exists as palladium oxide {{that can be easily}} reduced to Pd metal. The catalysts were tested in selective oxidation of <b>piperonyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> to piperonylaldehyde at 80 °C. The Pd/H-Beta zeolite catalysts with the lowest silica-to-alumina ratio possess the highest catalytic activity in benzylic alcohol oxidation reaction...|$|E
40|$|In this work, an {{eco-friendly}} {{process for}} piperonal synthesis from <b>piperonyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> oxidation was developed. Piperonal was obtained with 100 % selectivity under solvent free conditions, using air as oxidant at atmospheric pressure. The preparation of high surface area CeO 2 using a surfactant-template method allowed {{the preparation of}} a catalyst with highly dispersed Au nanoparticles having an average diameter of about 1 nm. The obtained results, using Au/CeO 2 catalysts, suggested that the reaction network consists in the rapid oxidation of <b>piperonyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> to piperonal. Increasing reaction time to promote alcohol conversion a very small amount of formed aldehyde undergoes to further oxidation to the acid. Subsequently, piperonylic acid can easily react with the alcohol, leading {{to the formation of}} the ester that can be adsorbed on the catalyst surface, deactivating the materials. Nevertheless, the fine-tuning of the process, using solvent free conditions, air and low reaction time, demonstrated the possibility to control catalyst deactivation. Indeed, gold supported on nano-CeO 2 were able to catalyse the production of piperonal without by-product formation, with 35 % of <b>piperonyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> conversion after 45 min of reaction and the catalyst can be recycled without any activity loss, demonstrating the possibility of scaling up a low conversion continuous process or low reaction time batch process. No toxic reagents were used neither for catalysts preparation nor for catalytic tests and the use of air as oxidant improved the safety of the process. The latter, together with the absence of a solvent, can led to important advancements in the industrial applications reducing the costs of the purification section. This versatile approach, interesting from both the economic and the environmental point of view, was also applied in the synthesis of other aromatic aldehydes, such as benzaldehyde, vanillin and anysil aldehyde, highlighting the importance of this process...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHydrosoluble {{sesame oil}} fatty acid transesters having {{enhanced}} antioxidant activities were synthesizedin a two-step process. The key step involved the biocatalyzed (lipase from Candida antarctica) acylation of sesame oil methanolic ester with either vanillyl (VNA) or <b>piperonyl</b> benzylic <b>alcohols,</b> or 5 -hydroxymethyl resorcinol (5 -HMR). These substrates {{were selected to}} introduce phenolic orsesamol structurally related frameworks. The VNA and 5 -HMR-derived transesters were obtainedwith 20 - 40 % yields and retained the starting proportions of sesame oil linoleic, oleic, and saturatedacids, these fatty acids also being the only constituents of the nonesterified fraction. The VNAderivedtransester showed the best antioxidant capacity in standard assays and was processed asthe unique lipid phase of spray-dried emulsions containing {{a high level of}} linoleic acid phenolic ester. These emulsions provided a high degree of protection to UV-irradiated fibroblasts, through thepotential synergy between VNA antioxidant action and replenishment of damaged membranes byunsaturated fatty acids...|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of the southern cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, (Canestrini), in the United States would have devastating consequences on the cattle industry. Tick populations have developed resistance to current acaricides, highlighting the need to identify new biochemical targets along with new chemistry. Furthermore, acaricide resistance could further hamper control of tick populations during an outbreak. Botanically-based compounds may provide a safe alternative for efficacious control of the southern cattle tick. We have developed a heterologous expression system that stably expresses the cattle tick 2 ̆ 7 s tyramine receptor with a G-protein chimera, producing {{a system that is}} amenable to high-throughput screening. Screening an in-house terpenoid library, at two screening concentrations (10 μM and 100 μM), has identified four terpenoids (<b>piperonyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> 1, 4 -cineole, carvacrol and isoeugenol) that we believe are positive modulators of the southern cattle tick 2 ̆ 7 s tyramine receptor...|$|E
