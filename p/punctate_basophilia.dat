50|$|Basophilic {{stippling}} a.k.a. <b>punctate</b> <b>basophilia</b> {{refers to}} observing a blood smear in which erythrocytes display small dots at the periphery. These dots are the visualization of ribosomes and {{can often be}} found in the peripheral blood smear, even in some normal individuals.|$|E
40|$|T H E {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the clinical significance of <b>punctate</b> <b>basophilia</b> by estimating the number of such cells per million ery-throcytes in the blood films of persons with widely varying states of health. The need for some definite standard became apparent from reports, made by an unusually careful laboratory technician, which showed the frequent appearance of <b>punctate</b> <b>basophilia</b> in the routine blood smears of office patients. Also, my interest had been stimulated during the past several years by observations on patients in the hematologic clinic of the University of California, showing <b>punctate</b> <b>basophilia</b> to be present in conditions quite apart from lead absorption and lead intoxication. Our findings raised the following questions concerning the clinical sig-nificance of <b>punctate</b> <b>basophilia,</b> or stippling, as it is frequently termed: (1) To what extent and how frequently does <b>punctate</b> <b>basophilia</b> occur in apparently normal individuals? (2) How frequently is it found in the " general run " of office patients...|$|E
40|$|The clinical, biochemical, and haema-tological {{aspects of}} a recent {{outbreak}} of lead poisoning, in which exposure {{was related to the}} oxyacetylene cutting of red lead painted ironwork, were investigated. Initial suspicion was raised when a blood film showed <b>punctate</b> <b>basophilia</b> which remains a simple and useful method of picking up lead toxicity. Estimations of blood lead concentration and conven-tional laboratory data confirmed the diagnosis. Although there was prominent <b>punctate</b> <b>basophilia,</b> spectrophotometric analysis showed only negligible accumu-lation of pyrimidine- 5 '-nucleotides des-pite severe suppression of pyrimidine- 5 '-nucleotidase activity. The pattern of the red cell glycolytic intermediates, in-vestigated for the first time, suggested that lead may also affect glycolysis at the hexokinase step. Once the diagnosis was made intravenous chelation treatment was begun with a rapid improvement in symptoms. Long term follow up is required to assess any sequelae of intoxication. These cases emphasise the classic features of lead poisoning, and despite the currently available diagnostic tests, lead intoxica-tion may still go unrecognised unless a thorough occupational history is taken...|$|E
40|$|Hopkins, A. (1970). Brit. J. industr. Med., 27, 130 - 140. Experimental lead {{poisoning}} in the baboon. Twelve large and three infant baboons were poisoned by the intratracheal injection of lead carbonate in doses ranging from 50 to 135 mg/kg for 39 to 362 days. Eight baboons {{had one or}} more epileptic fits. Weakness of the limbs, believed to be of central origin, was seen in three of them. The effect of single and multiple doses of lead on the blood lead is recorded. Anaemia and <b>punctate</b> <b>basophilia</b> were not found. Measurements of nerve conduction velocity, electromyography and histological examination showed no abnormality of the peripheral nerves. The different effects of lead upon different species are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Přerovská, and Teisinger, J. (1970). Brit. J. industr. Med., 27, 352 - 355. Excretion of {{lead and}} its {{biological}} activity {{several years after}} termination of exposure. A group of 27 persons who had been treated some years previously for chronic lead poisoning at our clinic, and who had not come into occupational contact with lead since, was examined. Half of them had had no occupational exposure to lead for 3 to 5 years and the others for 8 to 17 years. In most of these persons there is still an increased lead excretion, originating from an increased deposit in the bones. The mobilization test after calcium versenate (CaEDTA) injection was greater than 0 · 350 mg/ 24 hours. The values found for haemoglobin, <b>punctate</b> <b>basophilia,</b> coproporphyrin and ALA in urine were normal, but there was, in all cases, a decreased ALA-D activity. This finding suggests biological activity of such negligible lead flow many years after termination of exposure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} chronic cyanide {{exposure}} in the electroplating sections of three factories employing 36 workers was studied and {{compared with a}} control group. The concentration of cyanides to which the workers were exposed was measured. The regression line showing the relationship between thiocyanates in urine and the concentration of cyanides in the air was plotted. Increased percentages of haemoglobin and lymphocyte count were present in all exposed workers, in addition to <b>punctate</b> <b>basophilia</b> in 28 workers. Cyanmethaemoglobin {{was found to be}} characteristic. Apart from other complaints, two men with psychosis similar to one case reported in therapeutic thiocyanate intoxication were found. Twenty of the workers had thyroid enlargements to a variable degree and consistency, in two of whom it resembled lymphadenoid goitre. Thyroid 131 I uptakes at 4 and 24 hours were significantly higher than in the controls, while 131 PBI was unchanged. The reason for this iodine deficiency-like action is discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{rabbits and}} cats {{in which a}} hemorrhagic anemia has been produced, the {{hemoglobin}} is regenerated much more slowly than the red corpuscles, but the index, relative to the red corpuscles, never rises above one. The resistance of the corpuscles is not increased. In erythrocytes developing in the bone marrow, {{the nucleus of the}} erythroblasts seems to lose its chromatin, but is apparently not extruded. <b>Punctate</b> <b>basophilia</b> of the erythrocytes is a common feature and seems to result from a diffusion of nuclear chromatin through the cell. Extramedullary myeloid metaplasia is generally slight, but in moderately severe and long continued anemia from bleeding it may be very extensive. Lipemia usually occurs when the blood is reduced below a certain limit. The greater part of the fat in the serum can be extracted with ether and is stained by osmic acid. Extensive fatty infiltration of the organs may occur and also widespread necrosis in the central parts of the liver lobules. Pigmentation of the internal organs is usually only slight, but may be considerable, particularly in the spleen. Although there are minor differences, all the essential features of anemia produced by toxins can be reproduced by hemorrhage...|$|E
