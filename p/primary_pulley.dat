40|$|AbstractThe {{design of}} Single Acting Pulley Actuator (SAPA) Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) {{utilizes}} combinations of DC motor system, gear reducers and power cam mechanisms to actuate <b>primary</b> movable <b>pulley</b> sheaves on the transmission shaft. The secondary pulley supported by spring provides a belt clamping force to prevent slips, while the secondary controls the rubber v-belt from slipping. Since {{the methods of}} controlling these are similar, this paper only discusses the primary part. The servomotor regulates the axial movement of <b>primary</b> movable <b>pulley</b> sheaves to shift the rubber v-belt placed between the sheaves, and change the belt-pulley contact radius.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{theoretical}} and experimental evaluation {{of the performance of}} a CVTchain drive in steady state conditions. We propose an enhanced version of the CMM model, toaccurately predict the slip behavior and the traction performance of the variator. To achievethis objective it is necessary to accurately estimate the elastic displacements of the pulley. Thedetermination of the actual pulley deformation allows to obtain a better estimation of the slidingvelocities between the pins and the pulley surfaces and, therefore, to calculate the amount of totalslip between the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>pulleys,</b> with a higher degree of accuracy. In contrast tomultibody models, the approach presented here has a very simple formulation and results in a easyimplementation, which allows a complete and fast evaluation of the variator working points. Thetheoretical results are discussed and critically compared with experimental data. The comparisonconfirms the validity of the CMM approach in a large range of clamping forces, speed ratios andtorque loads...|$|R
30|$|Driveline {{efficiency}} {{can significantly}} affect car fuel economy, and studying this relationship through bench and road tests requires long working periods, high costs, and heavy workloads. Such tests {{can also lead}} to certain blindness for the determination of vehicle and various assembly schemes, the selection of structural parameters and the matching of driveline parameters with an engine, all of which can affect the creation of a better matching program, result in an unsatisfactory product performance, and wastage of resources [1]. Therefore, various computer simulation forecasting methods assisted by bench tests have been widely adopted to optimize driveline matching and study transmission efficiency. Such methods can improve design quality, shorten the development cycle, and reduce costs [2]. Numerous studies on the efficiency of CVT and gearbox have been conducted through bench tests in China and abroad. Akehurst et al. [3 – 5] used bench tests to study torque losses in a metal belt CVT, which were caused by the relative sliding motion between belt segments and bands. They then forecasted and studied torque losses between belt segments and bands caused by the bending and deformation of the pulley based on experimental observations of pulley deflections. Furthermore, they studied the sliding speed of belt segments relative to the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>pulleys</b> and its effects on torque loss, after which they proposed a model for the effects. They validated their proposed model using a number of experimental data. Meanwhile, various transmission power losses of CVT have been analyzed, and the transmission efficiencies of metal belts have been measured through bench tests [6]. However, the effects of CVT efficiency on car fuel economy have not yet been studied through real car tests. Huang et al. [7] conducted a CVT efficiency bench test using an electronically controlled gasoline engine as the power source, in which ratio, torque, and torque transmission ranges with high efficiency were measured. However, they did not validate the results using a real car test. In addition, researchers have investigated the influences of gear precision, bearing fit quality, and gear oil in the gearbox on transmission efficiency. Wang et al. [8] selected manual transmission as the research object to determine the influence of different gear precisions on transmission drive efficiency under various working conditions through bench tests. The results showed that a high-precision gear with a grinding process could evidently improve transmission drive efficiency. Gear precision mainly influences mesh precision and transmission dynamic stability. Considerable work has been done to analyze the influence of different types of gear oil on transmission efficiency under various working conditions through bench tests [9 – 11]. Similarly, Zhu et al. [12] studied the power loss of CVTs, including torque loss and speed loss, based on the transmission mechanism of CVTs, and experiments on CVT efficiency were conducted on a specific CVT test bench. Furthermore, they provided optimal structural parameters to serve as references for designing and tuning CVTs.|$|R

Carbone, L. Mangialardi, G. Mantriota, The influence of pulley deformations on the shifting mechanisms of MVB-CVT, ASME Journal of MechanicalDesign 127 (2005) 103 – 113]. A very good agreement between theory and experiments is found. In particular it is shownthat, during creep-mode (slow) shifting, {{the rate of change}} of the speed ratio is a linear function of the logarithm ofthe ratio between the axial clamping forces acting on the two movable pulleys. The shifting speed is also shown to be proportionalto the angular velocity of the <b>primary</b> <b>pulley,</b> and to increase as the clamping force on the secondary pulley isincreased. Indeed, a growth of the clamping force increases the pulley bending and, therefore, in agreement with the CMMmodel, increases the shifting speed. The authors also propose a relatively simple differential equation to describe the creepmodeevolution of the variator. Few parameters appear in the formula, which may be calculated either experimentally ortheoretically.

40|$|Today's vehicle must be {{efficient}} {{in terms of}} gas (CO 2, NOx) emissions and fuel consumption. Due to improvements in material and oil, the continuous variable transmission (CVT) is now making a breakthrough in the automotive market. The CVT decouples the engine from the wheel speed. CVT enables significant fuel gains by shifting the engine operating point for specific power demands. This optimization of the operating point enables a reduction of this fuel consumption. A CVT is constituted of two pulley sheaves, one fixed {{and the other one}} movable in its axial direction when subjected to an external axial force, in general hydraulic. The transition from the minimum to the maximum speed ratio is continuous and an infinite numbers of ratio is available between these two limits. An intermediate element (a metallic belt or chain) transmits the power from the input (the primary) to the exit (the secondary) of the CVT or variator. Further improvements of the fuel consumption and gas emission are still required for example by improving the variator efficiency. Increasing hydraulic performance or decreasing mechanical losses by reducing the axial forces are some solutions. The latter method is not without risks. The diminution of the clamping forces increases the slip between pulley sheaves and the intermediate element. If the axial forces decrease too much, high slip values can be reached and cause damage to the pulleys and the intermediate element. Control of the slip is an attractive solution to decrease the clamping forces in order to safely improve the variator efficiency. The objective of this thesis is to understand and model the slip of each pulley and establish analytic tools dedicate to the variator control. The slip study and the theoretical approach of the CVT variator is applied to the slip control of the variator with a chain. The contribution of this work is threefold. Firstly, the slip and the traction coefficient are analyzed for each pulley. The slip analysis of each pulley is then used to define a new slip synthesis as the summation of the slip of each pulley. It is demonstrated that the slip and the traction coefficient are different for each pulley and depend on the speed ratio of the variator. In low ratios, both the secondary pulley and the <b>primary</b> <b>pulley</b> slip, but only the primary reaches macro slip. For middle or higher ratios, only the secondary pulley slips and reaches high values of slip. Experiments show that the pulley with the smallest clamping force limits the system. Secondly, based on kinematics, force equilibrium, elastic deformations of the pulleys and the intermediate element, a detail model of the variator is proposed. The principal results are the estimation of the clamping forces, of the traction curve for each pulley and of the chain efficiency. These results are implemented in a simpler model that describes the variator dynamics. This last model considers the two pulleys and the intermediate element as free bodies. The hydraulic circuit and the actuators, which are important to take into account for control, are also modeled. Thirdly, the new slip synthesis and the results of the dynamic models are applied to the slip control of the variator in order to improve the efficiency. A pole placement law is applied to the actuators to control the flow that enters or exits the pulleys. With this law, the actuators are decoupled and the bandwidth is increased sufficiently for actuators dynamics to be neglected. The primary and the secondary pressures are decoupled and linearized by an input-output feedback linearization. The resulting system is linear and linear control theory can be applied to control the two pressures. The speed ratio is controlled by the primary clamping force. The secondary pressure is chosen {{as a function of the}} control mode of the variator: standard mode or slip mode. In standard mode, the intermediate element is overclamped by 30 %, whereas in slip mode, the secondary clamping force is set as a function of the desired slip. By controlling the slip at 2 %, the mechanical efficiency was increased by more than 2 % and the clamping forces reduced by more than 30 %. For the slip control, a proportional-integrator law and a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) are presented and the performances compared. The MRAC gives slightly better results...|$|E
