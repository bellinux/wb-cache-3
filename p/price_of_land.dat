5|$|The {{major change}} in {{agriculture}} in Kerala occurred in the 1970s when production of rice fell due to increased availability of rice all over India and decreased availability of labour. Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and {{a major portion of}} the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops. Profitability of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour, the high <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> and the uneconomic size of operational holdings.|$|E

Thus the construction of skyscrapers is dictated by economics and results in skyscrapers in a certain part of a large city unless a building code restricts the height of buildings.|$|E

The basic concepts {{of the real estate}} market are presented, as well as the factors which affect the value of real estate. Data on advertised and selling <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> properties in the Pomurska statistical region was collected. Based on the collected data, a statistical analysis was made for land prices in several developmental stages, as well as a comparison between advertised and selling <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> properties across the region and local communities. Due to lack <b>of</b> data on <b>land</b> <b>prices,</b> the market value <b>of</b> <b>land</b> at various development stages in the municipality of Moravske Toplice was assessed using the land development method. The results of the analysis have shown that {{there is a big difference}} between the advertised and selling prices, which is the consequence of various factors, mainly depends on the location <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> and the balance between supply and demand on the real estate market.

25|$|The <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> was the {{dominant}} election issue: The business {{strategy of the}} Canterbury Association was to sell land at a price that was sufficient to finance all the development that was necessary for the new settlement. The other two candidates, James FitzGerald and Henry Tancred, were therefore both proponents of a high land price. Campbell {{on the other hand}} was in favour of setting a low price for land outside the Canterbury Block. Hence there was a real possibility that vote splitting would result in neither Tancred nor FitzGerald being elected.|$|E

In November 1958, the RLA and Zeckendorff began negotiating over the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and {{the composition of}} the buildings to be built at L'Enfant Plaza. In December 1959, Zeckendorf won approval to build a 1,000-room hotel and five privately owned office buildings on L'Enfant Plaza. The Redevelopment Land Agency also approved the condemnation and razing of 14 city blocks for construction of the plaza, hotel, and office buildings. Construction was scheduled to begin on January 1, 1961, but was delayed due to unresolved design issues with L'Enfant Promenade, the short time-frame to prepare detailed construction plans, and because Congress had not granted air rights above 9th Street SW to the developers.|$|E

After some haggling {{over the}} <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> etc., {{a report of}} actual construction was presented on 30 Oct 1846. However work was then suspended as the company {{had run out of}} money. A public offering of five year bonds at 5% per annum raised only £50,000 so a further Act of Parliament (22 Jul 1848) was required to increase the capital by £250,000 to £650,000. The two owning companies each provided half of this amount. On 20 Jan 1849 a viaduct near Oxford Road collapsed as the scaffolding was removed. Three men died and two were injured. On the 25th the two adjacent arches failed without injury. The accepted reason was slow setting of mortar in wet weather.|$|E

The first was built in 1999 on Tržaška cesta 202 and the second was built in 2008 on Tržaška cesta 204.

25|$|Octavian {{returned}} to Rome {{two years after}} defeating Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium. With Mark Antony's defeat, no one remained to oppose Octavian. Decades of war had taken a terrible toll on the People of Rome. The political situation was unstable, {{and there was a}} constant threat of renewed warfare. Octavian's arrival alone caused a wave of optimism to ripple throughout Italy. As soon as he arrived, he began addressing the problems that were plaguing Rome. He declared a general amnesty for the former supporters of his enemies, and provided land for over 120,000 former soldiers. As soon as these reforms had been implemented, the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> began to rise and trade was revived. Octavian's popularity soon reached new heights, which ultimately gave him the support he needed to implement his reforms. When Octavian deposed Mark Antony in 32 BC, he resigned his position as triumvir, but was probably vested with powers similar to those that he had given up. In 29 BC, another alteration was made to his legal status, of which we know very little. We know that it involved the granting to Octavian of Consular imperium (command authority), and thus control over the army and the provinces. This alteration probably also gave him the authority to take a census.|$|E

Two models are proposed for <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> <b>landing</b> slots: one with an exogenously determined allocation, and the second with an endogenous allocation. Each model derives the flight patterns, ticket prices, routes, and carrier choice for passengers, and landing fees. A small example is included to illustrate the properties of the models. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{intersection}} between valuation {{practice and}} market theory is examined.
