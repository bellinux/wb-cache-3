5|$|The minor inmates at the Castellania {{were the}} ones who took care of the general maintenance, {{cleaning}} and repair works of the building, while guards were responsible for the allocation of tasks and observing their performance. Some historical graffiti made by prisoners {{can be found at the}} courtyard of the <b>prison.</b> <b>At</b> the underground are the dungeons, which are described as an unpleasant place to stay.

5|$|Cornelio Saavedra, who {{was aware}} of the conspiracy, {{considered}} it a plot by peninsulars to secure political power over the criollo peoples. He marched with the Regiment of Patricians swiftly to the Plaza, and thwarted the mutiny. There was no violence in the operation, as the criollos forced the rebels to give up just by the sheer force of numbers. Thus, Liniers stayed in office as viceroy. All the heads of the mutiny were sentenced to <b>prison</b> <b>at</b> Carmen de Patagones, and the militias that took part in it were dissolved. The only peninsular militias remaining were those of Andaluces and Montañeses, who did not join the mutiny; criollos obtained the military command, and the political power of Saavedra increased even more.|$|E

5|$|Noriega was extradited to France on April 26, 2010.

On July 7, 2010, Noriega was convicted by the 11th chamber of the Tribunal Correctionnel de Paris and sentenced to seven years in jail. The prosecutor in the case had sought a ten-year prison term. In addition, the court ordered the seizure of €2.3million (approximately U.S. $3.6million) that had long been frozen in Noriega's French bank accounts.|$|E
5|$|The court deliberated {{for nearly}} two months before passing {{judgement}} on 30 September, with the defendants being individually sentenced on 1 October. Hess was found guilty on two counts: crimes against peace (planning and preparing a war of aggression), and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes. He {{was found not guilty}} of war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was given a life sentence, one of seven Nazis to receive prison sentences at the trial. These seven were transported by aircraft to the Allied military <b>prison</b> <b>at</b> Spandau in Berlin on 18 July 1947. The Soviet member of the tribunal, Major-General Iona Nikitchenko, filed a document recording his dissent of Hess's sentence; he felt the death sentence was warranted.|$|E

5|$|The {{land was}} officially renamed Melville Island in late 1804 or early 1805 {{in honour of}} Henry Dundas, Viscount Melville (who at the time had just been {{appointed}} First Lord of the Admiralty). A wooden barracks-style military prison was constructed to house common prisoners, the cornerstone of which was laid in 1808 and is today preserved as a monument, while a multi-storey building was designed to hold officers. As no exchange system was established with the French, the prison quickly became overcrowded. Some Spanish prisoners were also housed in the <b>prison</b> <b>at</b> this time.|$|E
5|$|The state {{government}} {{made the decision}} to decommission Fremantle Prison in 1983, but it remained in operation until 30 November 1991.

There were divergent views in the community over the site's future: some wanted it demolished and redeveloped, or turned into gardens with a small monument; others wanted the historic site to be preserved, but were opposed to turning the misery of prisoners into entertainment for tourists. The ultimate decision was for conservation of the prison, but allowing for the buildings to be adapted for reuse by the community.|$|E

5|$|Within a {{few months}} of the {{founding}} of the Swan River Colony in June 1829 by free-settlers, there was a need for a prison to incarcerate criminals. There was little infrastructure for the settlers, let alone criminals, so the shipwrecked Marquis of Angelsea, just off the coast from South Beach, was used as a makeshift prison. This arrangement was quite arduous for the sheriff, who spent much of his time rowing a small boat, either to transfer prisoners or bring over their meals. It was not until September 1830 that work started on a new <b>prison</b> <b>at</b> the west end of High Street: the twelve-sided Round House on Arthur Head.|$|E
5|$|Work {{was carried}} out between 1616 and 1733, {{bringing}} the castle back into good order. As part of this, the spine wall was rebuilt properly, and the second floor windows enlarged. The courtroom featured a chair for the Stannary court judge, additional seating for the court officials and a railed, public section around {{the outside of the}} room. The courtroom also doubled as a hall for village dances and feasts. At the start of the 19th century, however, Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt, the Lord Warden of the Stannaries, began the construction of Dartmoor <b>Prison</b> <b>at</b> Princetown. Dartmoor Prison and Princetown grew increasingly important and courts began to be held there instead of Lydford Castle.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to U.S. Army {{regulations}} as well, {{no charges}} were ever filed against Stone {{nor did he}} stand trial. While he was in solitary confinement at Fort Lafayette, he could not exercise, and consequently Stone's health began to degrade. His physicians protested heavily to Stanton, who ordered him transferred to the military <b>prison</b> <b>at</b> Fort Hamilton. There Stone was allowed to exercise and his condition improved. He stayed at Fort Lafayette for fifty days, and would spend another 139 in Fort Hamilton. Stone was finally released without explanation or apology on August 16, 1862. The reason for his release was new legislation written by California Senator James A. McDougall. In a small addition to another bill, McDougall reiterated the Articles of War requirement that official charges be filed within eight days of arrest, but went on to include that any imprisoned officer must be given their trial within thirty days. McDougall also made it clear this legislation applied to those currently under arrest, which covered Stone's case. It passed the U.S. Congress and {{was signed into law}} by President Lincoln on July 17, 1862. Stanton then waited the thirty days before releasing Stone.|$|E
