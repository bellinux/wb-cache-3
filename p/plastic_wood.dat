2500|$|The Mk VII was {{different}} from earlier [...]303 bullet designs or spitzer projectiles in general. Although {{it appears to be}} a conventional spitzer-shape full metal jacket bullet, this appearance is deceptive: its designers made the front third of the interior of the Mk 7 bullets out of aluminium (from Canada) or tenite (cellulosic <b>plastic),</b> <b>wood</b> pulp or compressed paper, instead of lead and they were autoclaved to prevent wound infection. This lighter nose shifted the centre of gravity of the bullet towards the rear, making it tail heavy. Although the bullet was stable in flight due to the gyroscopic forces imposed on it by the rifling of the barrel, it behaved very differently upon hitting the target. As soon as the bullet hit the target and decelerated, its heavier lead base caused it to pitch violently and deform, thereby inflicting more severe gunshot wounds than a standard single-core spitzer design. In spite of this, the Mk VII bullet was legal due to the full metal jacket used according to the terms of the Hague Convention.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} an experimental investigation on developing <b>wood</b> <b>plastic</b> composites reinforced with continuous glass fibers in an extrusion process. The main role of wood component in <b>wood</b> <b>plastic</b> composite is mainly as a filler to reduce cost, and not reinforcing. Adding wood component causes a noticeable reduction in strength and toughness. This will hinder their usage in load-bearing applications. In this study, a novel method for production of hybrid <b>wood</b> <b>plastic</b> composites is introduced. This manufacturing process takes {{the advantages of}} a cost-effective and flexible production line. First, E-glass rovings were impregnated with a polymer in an especially designed (impregnating) die. Then, six melt impregnated glass rovings were integrated with <b>wood</b> <b>plastic</b> composites in a single step via an extrusion process. Another unique die was designed and manufactured to feed and position the impregnated glass rovings into a round shaped <b>wood</b> <b>plastic</b> composite profile. <b>Wood</b> content was changed in three levels to investigate {{its effect on the}} processability and the final properties of the hybrid composites. The experimentation on the extruded hybrid <b>wood</b> <b>plastic</b> composites proved the feasibility of the process and the relative uniformity of the roving positions in the extrudate. Three-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate the flexural properties. Improvements in strength, modulus, and toughness were dramatic...|$|R

Heat exposure to the materials (e.g. <b>plastics,</b> <b>wood)</b> will result in either physical or chemical changes.
