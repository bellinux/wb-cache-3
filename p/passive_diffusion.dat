5|$|Metformin has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base {{than most other}} basic drugs with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid <b>passive</b> <b>diffusion</b> of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As {{a result of its}} low lipid solubility it requires the transporter SLC22A1 in order for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation with the aim of producing prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin.|$|E

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{proposed}} that drug permeation is essentially carrier-mediated only and that <b>passive</b> lipoidal <b>diffusion</b> is negligible. This opposes the prevailing hypothesis of drug permeation through biological membranes, which integrates the contribution of multiple permeation mechanisms, including both carrier-mediated and <b>passive</b> lipoidal <b>diffusion,</b> depending on the compound's properties, membrane properties, and solution properties. The prevailing hypothesis of drug permeation continues to be successful for application and prediction in drug development. Proponents of the carrier-mediated only concept argue against <b>passive</b> lipoidal <b>diffusion.</b> However, the arguments are not supported by broad pharmaceutics literature.

25|$|Prostaglandins were {{originally}} believed {{to leave the}} cells via <b>passive</b> <b>diffusion</b> because of their high lipophilicity. The discovery of the prostaglandin transporter (PGT, SLCO2A1), which mediates the cellular uptake of prostaglandin, demonstrated that diffusion alone cannot explain the penetration of prostaglandin through the cellular membrane. The release of prostaglandin has now {{also been shown to}} be mediated by a specific transporter, namely the multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4, ABCC4), a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily.

We obtained a 20 - 80 % rise time (tr) of approximately 80 micros at 22 degrees C, shorter than any previously reported values, and tr variability (SD) with an upper limit of 25 - 30 micros. Extracellular electrode pressure can increase tr and its variability by 2 - to 3 -fold. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we modeled <b>passive</b> acetylcholine <b>diffusion</b> through a vesicle fusion pore expanding radially at 25 nm x ms(- 1) (rapid, from endplate omega figure appearance) or 0. 275 nm x ms(- 1) (slow, from mast cell exocytosis).

25|$|The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is {{a highly}} {{selective}} semipermeable membrane barrier that separates the circulating blood from the brain and extracellular fluid in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS).

Furthermore, it prevents the entry of lipophilic potential neurotoxins by way of an active transport mechanism mediated by P-glycoprotein.

25|$|The {{nervous system}} in beetles {{contains}} all the types found in insects, varying between different species. With three thoracic and {{seven or eight}} abdominal ganglia can be distinguished to that {{in which all the}} thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a composite structure. Oxygen is obtained via a tracheal system. Air enters a series of tubes along the body through openings called spiracles, and is then taken into increasingly finer fibers. Pumping movements of the body force the air through the system. Some species of diving beetles (Dytiscidae) carry a bubble of air with them whenever they dive beneath the water surface. This bubble may be held under the elytra or it may be trapped against the body using specialized hairs. The bubble usually covers one or more spiracles so the insect can breathe air from the bubble while submerged. An air bubble provides an insect with only a short-term supply of oxygen, but thanks to its unique physical properties, oxygen will diffuse into the bubble and displacing the nitrogen, called <b>passive</b> <b>diffusion,</b> however the volume of the bubble eventually diminishes and the beetle will have to return to the surface.|$|E
40|$|Jets are {{a common}} way to {{transfer}} mass among fluids, or from a fluid to a surface. At moderate Reynolds numbers and low turbulent intensities the jet exhibits a Near Field Region (NFR) several diameters long. The paper presents numerical results and a theoretical model for the <b>passive</b> scalar <b>diffusion</b> of a submerged free jet in the NFR. Large Eddy Simulations (LES), in the Reynolds number range of 5000 – 40, 000 and the Schmidt number range 1 – 100, are performed obtaining the passive scalar fields. Three mathematical models for the <b>passive</b> scalar <b>diffusion</b> are presented; {{the first one is}} valid in the NFR, specifically in the Undisturbed Region of Flow (URF), and the other two, obtained under the hypotheses of Tollmien and Görtler momentum spreading, are valid in the Potential Core Region (PCR).

The self-similar solutions of the passive scalar show good agreement with the LES results. The wide range of Reynolds and Schmidt numbers investigated gives generality to the results...|$|R

In the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deletions of PDR 5 or ERG 6 increase sensitivity to many small lipophilic drugs. Pdr 5 p is a plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette transporter that actively exports drugs, thereby lowering their intracellular levels. The mechanism by which ERG 6, an enzyme in sterol biosynthesis, affects drug accumulation is less clear. We show here that ERG 6 limits the rate of <b>passive</b> drug <b>diffusion</b> across the membrane, without affecting Pdr 5 p-mediated drug export.

The majority of thiamine present in the intestine is in the pyrophosphorylated form ThDP, but when thiamine arrives on the serosal side of the intestine it is often in the free form. The uptake of thiamine by the mucosal cell is likely coupled in some way to its phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.

40|$|A {{class of}} coupled cell-bulk ODE-PDE models is {{formulated}} and analyzed in a two-dimensional domain, which {{is relevant to}} studying quorum sensing behavior on thin substrates. In this model, spatially segregated dynamically active signaling cells of a common small radius ǫ ≪ 1 are coupled through a <b>passive</b> bulk <b>diffusion</b> field. For this coupled system, the method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to construct steady-state solutions and to formulate a spectral problem that characterizes the linear stability properties of the steady-state solutions, {{with the aim of}} predicting whether temporal oscillations can be triggered by the cell-bulk coupling. Phase diagrams in parameter space where such collective oscillations can occur, as obtained from our linear stability analysis, are illustrated for two specific choices of the intracellular kinetics. In the limit of very large bulk diffusion, it is shown that solutions to the ODE-PDE cell-bulk system can be approximated by a finite-dimensional dynamical system. This limiting system is studied both analytically, using a linear stability analysis, and globally, using numerical bifurcation software. For one illustrative example of the theory it is shown that when the number of cells exceeds some critical number, i. e. when a quorum is attained, the <b>passive</b> bulk <b>diffusion</b> field can trigger oscillations that would otherwise not occur without the coupling. Moreover, for two specific models for the intracellular dynamics, we show that there are rather wide regions in parameter space where these triggered oscillations are synchronous in nature. Unless the bulk diffusivity is asymptotically large, it is shown that a clustered spatial configuration of cells inside the domain leads to larger regions in parameter space where synchronous collective oscillations between the small cells can occur.
