40|$|<b>Plastic</b> <b>size</b> {{effects in}} single {{crystals}} are investigated by using finite strain and small strain discrete dislocation plasticity to analyse {{the response of}} cantilever beam specimens. Crystals with both one and two active slip systems are analysed, as well as specimens with different beam aspect ratios. Over the range of specimen sizes analysed here, the bending stress versus applied tip displacement response has a strong hardening plastic component. This hardening rate increases with decreasing specimen size. The hardening rates are slightly lower when the finite strain discrete dislocation plasticity (DDP) formulation is employed as curving of the slip planes is accounted for in the finite strain formulation. This relaxes the back-stresses in the dislocation pile-ups and thereby reduces the hardening rate. Our calculations show that {{in line with the}} pure bending case, the bending stress in cantilever bending displays a <b>plastic</b> <b>size</b> dependence. However, unlike pure bending, the bending flow strength of the larger aspect ratio cantilever beams is appreciably smaller. This is attributed to the fact that for the same applied bending stress, longer beams have lower shear forces acting upon them and this results in a lower density of statistically stored dislocations. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{influence}} of the <b>plastic</b> <b>size</b> effect on the fracture process of metallic materials is numerically analyzed using the strain-gradient plasticity (SGP) theory established from the Taylor dislocation model. Since large deformations generally occur in the vicinity of a crack, the numerical framework of the chosen SGP theory is developed for allowing large strains and rotations. The material model is implemented in a commercial finite element (FE) code by a user subroutine, and crack-tip fields are evaluated thoroughly for both infinitesimal and finite deformation theories by a boundary-layer formulation. An extensive parametric study is conducted and differences in the stress distributions ahead of the crack tip, as compared with conventional plasticity, are quantified. As a consequence of the strain-gradient contribution to the work hardening of the material, FE results show {{a significant increase in the}} magnitude and the extent of the differences between the stress fields of SGP and conventional plasticity theories when finite strains are considered. Since the distance from the crack tip at which the strain gradient significantly alters the stress field could be one order of magnitude higher when large strains are considered, results reveal that the <b>plastic</b> <b>size</b> effect could have important implications in the modelization of several damage mechanisms where its influence has not yet been considered in the literature...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe first {{formulation}} of a phase field model accounting for size-dependent viscoplasticity is developed to study materials in which microstructure evolution and viscoplastic behavior are strongly coupled. Plasticity is introduced using a continuum strain gradient formalism which captures the size {{effect of the}} viscoplastic behavior. First, the influence of this size effect on the mechanical behavior of the material is discussed in static microstructures. Then, the dynamic coupling between microstructure evolution and viscoplastic activity is addressed and illustrated by the rafting of the microstructure observed in Ni-base superalloys under creep conditions.

40|$|Marine plastic debris spans {{over six}} orders of {{magnitude}} in lineal size, from microns to meters. The broad range of plastic sizes mainly arises from the continuous photodegradation and fragmentation affecting the plastic objects. Interestingly, this time-dependent process links, to some degree, the size {{to the age of}} the debris. The variety of plastic sizes gives the possibility to marine biota to interact and possible take up microplastics through numerous pathways. Physical processes such as sinking and wind-induced transport or the chemical adsorption of contaminants are also closely related to {{the size and shape of}} the plastic items. Likewise, available sampling techniques should be considered as partial views of the marine <b>plastic</b> <b>size</b> range. This being so and given that the size is one of the most easily measurable plastic traits, the size spectrum appears as an ideal frame to arrange, integrate, and analyze plastic data of diverse nature. In this work, we examined tens of thousands of plastic items sampled from across the world with the aim of (1) developing and standardizing the size-spectrum tool to study marine plastics, and (2) assembling a global <b>plastic</b> <b>size</b> spectrum (GPSS) database, relating individual size measurements to abundance, color (129 tons), polymer type, and category (rigid fragments, films, threads, foam, pellets, and microbeads). Using GPSS database, we show for instance the dependence of plastic composition on the item size, with high diversity of categories for items larger than 1 cm and a clear dominance (~ 90 %) of hard fragments below, except for the size interval corresponding to microbeads (around 0. 5 mm).

40|$|International audienceDiscrete {{dislocation}} plasticity {{models and}} strain-gradient plasticity theories {{are used to}} investigate the role of interfaces in the elastic–plastic response of a sheared single crystal. The upper and lower faces of a single crystal are bonded to rigid adherends via interfaces of finite thickness. The sandwich system is subjected to simple shear, {{and the effect of}} thickness of crystal layer and of interfaces upon the overall response are explored. When the interface has a modulus less than that of the bulk material, both the predicted <b>plastic</b> <b>size</b> effect and the Bauschinger effect are considerably reduced. This is due to the relaxation of the dislocation stress field by the relatively compliant surface layer. On the other hand, when the interface has a modulus equal to that of the bulk material a strong size effect in hardening as well as a significant reverse plasticity are observed in small specimens. These effects are attributed to the energy stored in the elastic fields of the geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) ...|$|E

A transition occurred when the monotonic <b>plastic</b> zone <b>size</b> was equal to the α lath size, and this is attributed to the change from continuum to single crystal behavior at the crack tip.

40|$|International audienceThe composition, size distribution, and {{abundance}} of floating plastic debris in surface {{waters of the}} Mediterranean Sea were analyzed in relation to distance to land. We combined data from previously published reports with an intensive sampling in inshore waters of the Northwestern Mediterranean. The highest plastic concentrations were found in regions distant from from land {{as well as in}} the first kilometer adjacent to the coastline. In this nearshore water strip, plastic concentrations were significantly correlated with the nearness to a coastal human population, with local areas close to large human settlements showing hundreds of thousands of plastic pieces per km 2. The ratio of plastic to plankton abundance reached particularly high values for the coastal surface waters. Polyethylene, polypropylene and polyamides were the predominant plastic polymers at all distances from coast (86 to 97 % of total items), although the diversity of polymers was higher in the 1 -km coastal water strip due to a higher frequency of polystyrene or polyacrylic fibers. The <b>plastic</b> <b>size</b> distributions showed a gradual increase in abundance toward small sizes indicating an efficient removal of small plastics from the surface. Nevertheless, the relative abundance of small fragments (< 2 mm) was higher within the 1 -km coastal water strip, suggesting a rapid fragmentation down along the shoreline, likely related with the washing ashore on the beaches. This study constitutes a first attempt to determine the impact of plastic debris in areas closest to Mediterranean coast. The presence of a high concentration of plastic including tiny plastic items could have significant environmental, health and economic impacts...|$|E
40|$|Microplastics (< 5 mm) are {{ubiquitous}} {{in the marine}} environment and are ingested by zooplankton with possible negative effects on survival, feeding, and fecundity. The majority of laboratory studies has used new and pristine microplastics to test their impacts, while aging processes such as weathering and biofouling alter the characteristics of plastic particles in the marine environment. We investigated zooplankton ingestion of polystyrene beads (15 and 30 μm) and fragments (≤ 30 μm), and tested the hypothesis that microplastics previously exposed to marine conditions (aged) are ingested at higher rates than pristine microplastics. Polystyrene beads were aged by soaking in natural local seawater for three weeks. Three zooplankton taxa ingested microplastics, excluding the copepod Pseudocalanus spp., but the proportions of individuals ingesting plastic {{and the number of}} particles ingested were taxon and life stage specific and dependent on <b>plastic</b> <b>size.</b> All stages of Calanus finmarchicus ingested polystyrene fragments. Aged microbeads were preferred over pristine ones by females of Acartia longiremis as well as juvenile copepodites CV and adults of Calanus finmarchicus. The preference for aged microplastics may be attributed to the formation of a biofilm. Such a coating, made up of natural microbes, may contain similar prey as the copepods feed on in the water column and secrete chemical exudates that aid chemodetection and thus increase the attractiveness of the particles as food items. Much of the ingested plastic was, however, egested within a short time period (2 – 4 h) and the survival of adult Calanus females was not affected in an 11 -day exposure. Negative effects of microplastics ingestion were thus limited. Our findings emphasize, however, that aging {{plays an important role in}} the transformation of microplastics at sea and ingestion by grazers, and should thus be considered in future microplastics ingestion studies and estimates of microplastics transfer into the marine food web...|$|E

Bakelite waste is prohibited from disposing of direct landfilling and open burning because of the improper disposal and emission reasons. A large amount of this waste needs the large safe space of warehouse area for keeping which becomes a waste management problem. Size reduction by milling machine is helpful for waste handling and storing, however, the post-milling waste Bakelite plastic utilization shall be studied to maintain the waste storing capacity. There are some studies of the milling machine used for waste <b>plastic</b> <b>size</b> reduction. However, the particular study of milling machine application for waste size reduction and its milling waste utilization is still insufficient in Thailand. The purpose of this research is the use of waste Bakelite aggregate milling machine for Bakelite waste size reduction and use of the post-milling waste Bakelite as a fine aggregate to replace natural sand material in cement mortar.

The fatigue behaviour at elevated temperature has been reviewed with emphasis on the mechanisms of propagation proposed to explain the effects of temperature and frequency. The crack propagation characteristics of a single crystal superalloy have been investigated at various temperatures and frequencies. Determination of the fatigue crack propagation rates was combined with the measurement of crack tip <b>plastic</b> zone <b>sizes</b> and observation of the deformation behaviour. At elevated temperature, the fatigue crack propagation rates were determined to be dependent on the frequency of loading. At low and high crack growth rates increased crack propagation rates were associated with higher cycling frequencies. At intermediate crack growth rates, the highest propagation rates were associated with the lowest frequency. Selected area channelling pattern techniques were used to determine the <b>plastic</b> zone <b>sizes</b> and revealed that at high frequencies (> 10 Hz) the <b>plastic</b> zone <b>sizes</b> at elevated and ambient temperature are similar. With decreasing frequency at elevated temperature creep may lead to increased <b>plastic</b> zone <b>sizes</b> but may also affect the crack tip geometry thereby restricting further effects. At room temperature crack propagation is observed to occur by shear of the γ' precipitate on { 111 } resulting in { 111 } crystallographic facets on the fracture surface.
