During the springs and summers of 1998 – 2004, we collected predator and prey fishes (forage and juvenile salmonids) at the surface at night off {{the mouth of the}} Columbia River. Pacific hake Merluccius productus had relatively low percentages of empty stomachs during coolocean years (2000 through 2002) and high percentages during 1998, a warm-ocean year.

40|$|The Chair {{identified}} six {{aspects that}} provided a focus for discussions during the review: i. design of the acoustic and trawl sampling, representativeness of {{the data for the}} four CPS species; ii. analysis of the survey data for estimating CPS abundances; iii. evaluation of potential biases in sampling design and analysis; iv. characterization of uncertainty in estimates of CPS biomass; v. decision if acoustic-trawl estimates of CPS biomass can be used in stock assessments and management advice for <b>Pacific</b> sardine, <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> <b>Pacific</b> mackerel, and northern anchovy; and vi. guidance for future research. For orientation Dr Kevin Hill, SWFSC, gave a brief presentation of the most recent Pacific sardine stock assessment and management. Dr David Demer, Leader of the Advanced Survey Technologies Program (ASTP), SWFSC, gave a presentation of the acoustic-trawl method for assessing CPS, and this was followed by responses to several requests by the Panel for additional information. The acoustic-trawl surveys also have the potential to provide estimates of fish distribution and behavior, as well as information for ecosystem-based fishery management. The review was, however, focused on the provision of abundance estimates and this report reflects that focus. The ASTP prepared a thorough presentation, provided detailed background material, and were willing to respond to the Panel requests.

40|$|Based on a {{time series}} of ocean climate indices and catch records for seven pelagic fish speciesin the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) and Kuroshio-Oyashio Current (KOC) regions from 1910 to 2004, wedetected {{regional}} synchrony {{in the long-term}} fluctuations of the fish populations and identified alternation patternsof dominant species related to climate shifts. The annual catches of Pacific herring, Japanese sardines,Japanese anchovies, <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> chub <b>mackerel,</b> <b>Pacific</b> saury and common squid in the TWC regionfluctuated in phase {{with those in the}} KOC region, which suggests that they were controlled by the samebasin-wide climate forcing.

As sardine biomass decreased in the late stages ofthe cool regime, catch of the other four species increased immediately during the warm period of the 1990 s.

40|$|This study {{examines}} factors conditioning the fishing location {{decisions of the}} Chilean fleet operating in the South-east <b>Pacific</b> straddling <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> fishery, considering voyage data for the 1987 - 2004 period.

It is thought that this change dynamics may have been intensified by the strong 1997 - 98 El Niño event. The return of distant water-fishing-nation’s fleets to this fishery, as from the year 2000, has increased interest in understanding effects related with this spatial change dynamics.

40|$|Time {{series of}} ocean climate indices and catch records {{were used to}} {{identify}} the alternation patterns of pelagic fish populationsin relation to climate regime shifts. During 1910 - 2008, an orderly alternation of dominant pelagic fish groups wasobserved in the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC; Yellow Sea-East China Sea-East Sea/Japan Sea) and Kuroshio-OyashioCurrent (KOC; Northwestern Pacific) regions. After the collapse of herring fishery in the late 1920 s, the sardine (A group) dominated in the 1930 s, 3 other species (C group; <b>Pacific</b> saury, <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and anchovy) dominated in the 1950 s- 1960 s, chub mackerel (B group) dominated in the 1970 s, and then sardine (A group) dominated again during cool regimein the 1980 s. As sardine biomass decreased {{in association with the}} climate regime shift that occurred in the late 1980 s,catches of C group immediately increased after the regime shift and remained at high levels during warm regime in the 1990 s. Alternations of dominant fish groups occurred 6 times between 1910 and 2008. The dominant period of the 7 specieslasted for 10 - 20 years. The catch of Pacific sardine in the TWC and KOC regions showed a negative correlation withthe catch of the other 5 species (<b>Pacific</b> herring, anchovy, <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> <b>Pacific</b> saury, and common squid), suggestingthat the abundance of the 5 species is strongly affected by the abundance of Pacific sardine in relation to the climateregime shifts. The total catch level of the 7 species in the KOC region was generally higher than that in the TWC regionbefore 1991 but was lower after 1992, suggesting that the fish populations in the Pacific side are shifted to the TWC regionby zonal oscillation of the oceanic conditions in relation to the climate regime shift in the late 1980 s...|$|R
40|$|The Council first {{approved}} {{the use of}} the Acoustic Trawl Method (ATM) at its April 2011 Council meeting after the ATM underwent a methodology review in February 2011 with the following conclusion: “Overall, the Panel is satisfied that the design of the acoustic-trawl surveys, as well as the methods of data collection and analysis are adequate for the provision of advice on the abundance of <b>Pacific</b> sardine, <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and <b>Pacific</b> mackerel, subject to caveats, in particular related to the survey areas and distributions of the stocks at the times of the surveys. The Panel concluded that estimates from the acoustic-trawl surveys can be included in the 2011 Pacific sardine stock assessment as ‘absolute estimates’, contingent on the completion of two tasks. Estimates of absolute abundance for the survey area can be used as estimates of the biomass of <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> in US waters (even though they may not cover all US waters). The estimates of abundance for Pacific mackerel are more uncertain as measures of absolute abundance than for <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> or <b>Pacific</b> sardine. A major concern for this species is that a sizable (currently unknown) fraction of the stock is outside of the survey area. However, the present surveys cannot provide estimates of abundance for the northern anchovy stocks for use in management. The Panel notes that the acoustic-trawl method potentially could be applied to survey CPS currently in low abundances, e. g., northern anchovy and Pacific herring, but the sampling design would need to differ from that used in the present surveys. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Salmonid run {{sizes are}} {{strongly}} affected by their early marine stage. Fully understanding the life history of salmonids means understanding how {{they interact with}} their marine environment and with other fishes. Changes in the biological and physical environment off the Columbia River region affects the distribution and abundance of predatory fishes and their feeding, forage fishes, and juvenile salmonid marine survival. From 1998 - 2004, forage fish and predatory fish distribution and abundance off the Columbia River was quantified by surface trawling at night during spring/summer. The effect of predation on salmonids was measured by stomach analysis of predatory fishes. During the study period (1998 - 2004), forage fishes increased in abundance by orders of magnitude and were strongly related to the abundance of cold-water copepods the previous year. Higher forage fish populations were also linked to cooler ocean conditions and perhaps fewer predatory Pacific hake (Merluccius productus). Most forage fishes were distributed nearshore while predators had a more offshore distribution. Pacific hake was most abundant in 1998, 2003, and 2004; warm ocean years. <b>Jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus symmetricus) was most abundant during 1999 - 2002; relatively cool ocean years. Deep (50 -m) ocean temperatures and {{the date of the}} spring transition, when nearshore currents switched from northward to southward, were good predictors of Pacific hake abundance in the study area. Forage fish or salmonid occurrence in a haul was negatively related to the occurrence of predators. <b>Pacific</b> hake and <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> ate primarily euphausiids and small fishes. Salmonids were rarely eaten by either predator. However, because the Pacific hake population can be very large, hake predation can be a significant source of juvenile salmon mortality off the Columbia River during some years. A trophic model showed that marine mortality of Columbia River juvenile salmonids {{may be related to the}} abundance of Pacific hake and forage fishes. A multiple regression using the predictions from the trophic model of annual numbers of juvenile salmonids eaten by hake and Columbia River spring flows as independent variables, accounted for much of the variation observed in the annual marine survival of Columbia River coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), the dependent variable.

The purpose of these surveys {{was to determine the}} abundance, distribution, availability, and other pertinent biological information of the commercially important northern anchovy, <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel,</b> <b>Pacific</b> sardine, and Pacific mackerel. Latent resource species including Pacific saury, Pacific hake, squid, and pelagic red crab also were surveyed. The principal technique consisted of running acoustic transects with a horizontal ranging sonar and vertical echo sounder during daylight hours and fishing a midwater trawl at night. Results show the northern anchovy grossly dominates all other species in terms of biomass and abundance with the southern California-northern Baja California region containing most of the total population. Although {{it was not possible to}} determine absolute population size, results indicate the estimates of 2 to 6 million tons made from egg and larvae surveys are reasonable. Behavior and availability studies indicate that although the anchovy population is large, its vulnerability to harvest by the present commercial fishery varies considerably from year to year as well as seasonally. Most of the common schooling behaviors are unfavorable for effective harvest by roundhaul net. Only a small portion of the population is harvestable during any particular time period. Acoustic surveys were much less effective for estimating abundance of Pacific sardines, <b>Pacific</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel.</b> The distribution of <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> was patchy with nearly all significant concentrations located at a limited number of rocky banks and island coasts.

Previous analysis showed an increase in grenadier abundance, in the eastern North Pacific, which lagged epibenthic megafaunal abundance, mostly echinoderms, by 9 – 20 months. Subsequent diet studies suggested that carrion is the grenadier's most important food. Our goal was to evaluate if changes in carrion supply might drive the temporal changes in grenadier abundance. We analyzed a unique 17 year time series of abyssal grenadier abundance and size, collected at Station M (4100 m, 220 km offshore of Pt. Conception, California), and reaffirmed the increase in abundance and also showed an increase in mean size resulting in a ~ 6 fold change in grenadier biomass. We compared this data with abundance estimates for surface living nekton (<b>pacific</b> hake and <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel)</b> eaten by the grenadiers as carrion. A significant positive correlation between Pacific hake (but not <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel)</b> and grenadiers was found. Hake seasonally migrate to the waters offshore of California to spawn.

The correlation to grenadier abundance was strongest when using hake abundance metrics from the area within 100 nmi of Station M.

Given the results and grenadier longevity, migration is likely responsible for the results and the location of hake spawning probably {{is more important than the}} size of the spawning stock in understanding the dynamics of abyssal grenadier populations.

The two separate dorsal fins are composed of eight spines and one spine followed by 31 to 35 soft rays, respectively. The anal fin is composed of two spines anteriorly detached followed by one spine connected to 26 to 30 soft rays. In some larger individuals, the last few rays at the posterior of the soft dorsal and anal fins are almost entirely separate from the rest of the fin, forming finlets. The caudal fin is strongly forked, typical amongst the Carangidae, while the ventral fin consists of one spine and five soft rays. The pectoral fin terminates before the front of the anal fin, having 22 to 24 rays in total. The lateral line dips strongly after the pectoral fin, having 50 to 53 scales on the upper section and 43 to 52 keeled scutes posteriorly.

40|$|Pelagic fish {{schools are}} thought to show a general pattern of {{dispersion}} at night and aggregation within schools during the day. This pattern is often accepted as the major rule driving {{most of the other}} physiological, biological and ecological processes. Foraging on mobile prey, for instance, is assumed to be enhanced by schooling behaviour. Current theory assumes then that foraging is only possible for obligatory gregarious predatory fish from dawn to dusk. However, offshore mesopelagic communities perform vertical migrations and are out of reach for most oceanic pelagic predators during the day (with the exception of some apex predators, e. g. swordfish or big-eye tuna). To investigate how fish may overcome this apparent contradiction, we studied the 3 -dimensional spatial strategy of the South <b>Pacific</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> Trachurus murphyi according to the abiotic and biotic conditions of the habitat. Data came from acoustic surveys performed in central Chile in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Our results show that the jack mackerel distribution was driven by prey during the night when foraging, and related to the hydrology when resting during the day in {{the upper part of the}} oxycline. Fish were more aggregated at night than during the day, probably because jack mackerel cycles of schooling behaviour depend primarily on prey availability. This 'atypical' behaviour could be an adaptation of gregarious pelagic fish to an oceanic ecosystem. Fish schooling behaviour is not necessarily driven directly by the diel cycle; rather, it can be functional and depends on prey availability...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1970 s, South <b>Pacific</b> <b>jack</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Trachurus murphyi) {{is one of}} the world’s most {{important}} commercial exploited fish stock. The peak in the catch was achieved in the 1990 s, after which the catch for all fleets steadily decreased due to strong fishing mortality and potentially unfavourable environmental conditions. An application of the ecosystem and fish population model SEAPODYM was developed for this species in the South Pacific Ocean {{to determine the extent of}} environmental and fisheries drivers on the stock dynamics. We combined publicly available fishing data, acoustic biomass estimates and expert knowledge to optimise fish population dynamics parameters (habitats, movements, natural and fishing mortality). Despite a large proportion of missing catch over the simulation period, the model provides realistic distributions of biomass, a good fit-to-data and is in agreement with the literature. The feeding habitat is predicted to be delineated by water temperature between 15 °C for the first cohorts and 8. 5 °C for the oldest and dissolved oxygen concentration above 1. 8 ml/L. Optimal spawning temperature is estimated to 15. 57 °C (S. E. : 0. 75 °C). The core habitat is predicted off Central Chile which is also the main fishing ground. There are other areas of higher fish concentration east of New Zealand, in the eastern part of the southern convergence and off Peru and northern Chile.
