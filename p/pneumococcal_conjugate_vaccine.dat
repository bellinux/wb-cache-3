2500|$|In {{order to}} provide the best protection, {{children}} are recommended to receive vaccinations as soon as their immune systems are sufficiently developed to respond to particular vaccines, with additional [...] "booster" [...] shots often required to achieve [...] "full immunity". This has {{led to the development of}} complex vaccination schedules. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which recommends schedule additions for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommends routine vaccination of children against: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, polio, mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, HiB, chickenpox, rotavirus, influenza, meningococcal disease and pneumonia. A large number of vaccines and boosters recommended (up to 24 injections by age two) has led to problems with achieving full compliance. In order to combat declining compliance rates, various notification systems have been instituted and a number of combination injections are now marketed (e.g., <b>Pneumococcal</b> <b>conjugate</b> <b>vaccine</b> and MMRV vaccine), which provide protection against multiple diseases.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the tests}} show {{significant}} abnormalities {{of the immune}} system, a specialist in immunodeficiency or infectious diseases [...] {{will be able to}} discuss various treatment options. Absence of immunoglobulin or antibody responses to vaccine can be treated with replacement gamma globulin [...] infusions, or can be managed with prophylactic antibiotics and minimized exposure to infection. If antibody function is normal, all routine childhood immunizations including live viral vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella and varicella) should be given. In addition, several “special” vaccines (that is, licensed but not routine for otherwise healthy children and young adults) should be given to decrease the risk that an A-T patient will develop lung infections. The patient and all household members should receive the influenza (flu) vaccine every fall. People with A-T [...] who are less than two years old should receive three (3) doses of a <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>conjugate</b> <b>vaccine</b> (Prevnar) given at two month intervals. People older than two years who have not previously been immunized with Prevnar should receive two (2) doses of Prevnar. At least 6 months after the last Prevnar has been given and after the child is at least two years old, the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine should be administered. Immunization with the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine should be repeated approximately every five years after the first dose.|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} of meningitis due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRP) {{has increased in}} recent years, making treatment failure more likely.

We investigated this issue using a mathematical model applied to the current prevalence of resistance and antibiotic exposure in the United States and in France. Our main finding was {{that the level of}} antibiotic exposure may limit the effect of the vaccine. In relatively low antibiotic exposure environments such as the United States, large-scale vaccination prevents a large part of PRP meningitis cases, whereas in high antibiotic-exposure environments such as France, vaccination alone does not lead to a substantial reduction in PRP meningitis incidence. Our results suggest that antibiotic exposure reduction will remain of primary importance for the control of PRP meningitis despite wide scale use of <b>pneumococcal</b> <b>conjugate</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
