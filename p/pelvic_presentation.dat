40|$|Background: Chordoma is {{the most}} common primary {{malignant}} tumor of the spine. It is extremely rare and has been studied primarily in single-institution case series. Using data from a large, population-based cancer registry, we designed the present study to examine the outcome for patients with chordoma and to determine relevant prognostic factors. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the California Cancer Registry database was performed to identify patients with a diagnosis of chordoma in the years 1989 to 2007. Comparisons examined differences in demographics, disease char-acteristics, treatment, and survival. Survival analyses were performed with use of the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Four hundred and nine patients with chordoma were identified; 257 (62. 8 %) were male and 152 (37. 2 %) were female. With regard to racial or ethnic distribution, 266 patients (65 %) were white; ninety-three (22. 7 %), Hispanic; forty-three (10. 5 %), Asian or other; and seven (1. 7 %), black. The site of presentation was the head in 202 patients (49. 4 %), spine in 106 patients (25. 9 %), and pelvis and/or sacrum in 101 patients (24. 7 %). Hispanic race (p = 0. 0002), younger age (less than forty years; p < 0. 0001), and female sex (p = 0. 009) were associated with cranial presentation, whereas older age (forty years or older; p < 0. 0001) was associated with <b>pelvic</b> <b>presentation.</b> After adjustment for clinically relevant factors, a significantly decreased risk of death for chordoma-specific survival was seen for Hispanic race (hazard ratio = 0. 51, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 0. 28 to 0. 93; p = 0. 03), high socioeconomic status (hazard ratio = 0. 8, 95...|$|E
40|$|In a {{retrospective}} analysis of perinatal influencing factors in 186 premature newborns of the Department of Gynaecology of the University of Erlangen covering the period from 1982 - 1987 with birth weights between 500 and 1500 grams, the mortality and early morbidity were analysed, as characterised by cerebral haemorrhages, respiratory distress syndrome and infections insofar, {{as they had been}} connected with the obstetrical approach and paediatric intensive-care treatment, 45 infants born in 1982 / 83 were compared with 141 infants, who had been subjected to a different treatment approach during 1984 to 1987. During the second period, there was a marked drop both in mortality and in the incidence of asphyxia-induced severe cerebral haemorrhage and of the respiratory distress syndrome. A shortened latency period after premature rupture of the amnion, and a more pronounced presence of a neonatologically experienced team of paediatricians were found to be significant obstetric liberal influencing factors in determining the need to perform Caesarean section. The triplication of the frequency of Caesarean section observed resulted in a 50 % reduction in perinatal mortality and morbidity. Infants with <b>pelvic</b> <b>presentation</b> benefited most from the more liberal performance of Caesarean section, as did infants with vertex presentation. Shortening of the latency phase in premature rupture resulted in a marked reduction in infection morbidity and mortality. Therefore we conclude, that the frequently practised procrastination with the aim to await an improvement in lung maturity should be replaced by a more active obstetric management, avoiding both infection and birth trauma. Obstetric decisions should be based rather on prenatal estimation of weight than on the calculated gestational age. At present, the lowest birth weight associated with the expectation of a healthy life is considered to be 750 grams...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Fetal and preterm infant {{brain is}} {{especially}} vulnerable to hemorrhagic and ischemic damage {{at the end of}} the second and at the beginning of the third trimester. This is due to vascular, cellular and anatomic characteristics of the brain during development. In premature babies, there is a physiological instability and limited autoregulation of cerebral circulation. Hemorrhagic and ischemic damages often occur together, though pathophysiological processes leading to lesions are different. Material and methods The paper deals with a detailed analysis of 860 ultrasound brain scans of prematurely born children. The examinations were performed at the Ultrasound Department of the Institute of Child and Youth Health Care in Novi Sad. 707 vaginally born premature infants and 153 premature infants born by Cesarean section were examined. The bleeding was graded according to the Papile classification. Results and Discussion Out of 384 children with diagnosed grade I hemorrhage, 75 premature infants (19. 5 %) were born by Cesarean section. In the group of children with grade II hemorrhage, operative deliveries account for 14. 7 %. From the total of 85 children with grade III hemorrhage, (intraventricular bleeding with chamber dilatation), only 6 premature infants were born by Cesarean section (7 %). Intra-parenchymal bleeding was diagnosed in a very small number of premature infants; 0. 32 % of all diagnosed hemorrhages were grade IV hemorrhages. In this group there were no children born by Cesarean section. The increase of hemorrhage grade is accompanied by a greater rate of <b>pelvic</b> <b>presentation</b> and manual assistance by Bracht. There were 240 prematurely born children with no echosonographically diagnosed hemorrhage, 38 % of all examined premature infants. From this number, 13. 3 % of neonates were born by Cesarean section.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONInternal hernia {{is a rare}} entity {{which can}} cause {{intestinal}} obstruction. The {{most common type of}} internal hernia is the paraduodenal hernia which accounts for 53 % of cases, and the internal hernia within the pelvis account for 7 %. Perineal hernia, which is classified as pelvic hernia, usually occurs due to weakening of the pelvic floor musculature and thus, should be distinguished from the internal hernia caused by peritoneal defects in the <b>pelvic</b> cavity. <b>PRESENTATION</b> OF CASEWe present a case of 28 -year-old female who presented intestinal obstruction. Conservative therapies failed and she required emergency laparotomy. The operative findings revealed a peritoneal defect of 2 cm in diameter in the pouch of Douglas, through which the ileum was incarcerated and strangulated. The incarcerated bowel was reduced, and the intestinal color quickly returned to normal. Therefore a primary closure of the peritoneal defect was performed and the postoperative course was uneventful. DISCUSSIONA PubMed search for the case of internal hernia through a defect in the pouch of Douglas revealed only three, making this an extremely rare condition. CONCLUSIONBecause of rarity of this hernia, the etiology is unknown. However, our patient is a young female with no history of pregnancy, abdominal surgery, or trauma, therefore the cause of the peritoneal defect is considered congenital...|$|R

Edema of the fetus is associated with accumulation of fluids in several fetal compartments and soft tissues. NIHF may result from diseases of the heart, blood vessels, kidneys and urinary tract, lungs, gastrointestinal problems, blood disorders, disordered metabolism, chromosomal disorders, and infections. Diagnosis is based on ultrasonography. The aim of the study was to present NIHF case, diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties and indications for premature termination of pregnancy by caesarean section. Case study. A 40 -year-old pregnant woman, fourth pregnancy, was diagnosed with NIHF in 29 hbd. Despite a number of diagnostic tests for infections and congenital abnormalities, chromosomal disorders, etc., the cause of fetal edema was not established. Because of <b>pelvic</b> <b>presentation</b> of the fetus threatening severe asphyxia, emergency termination of the pregnancy by cesarean section was performed in 29 hbd. The baby did not survive. Unfortunately, the cause of NIHF was not established postnatally. The baby did not survive. Conclusions. Pregnant women are required to fully diagnose the causes of NIHF to promptly implement causative treatment. In the case of idiopathic NIHF, symptomatic treatment and earlier termination of pregnancy by cesarean section are recommended.

It can develop {{anywhere}} lymphoid tissue is found, but the expected origin is mediastinum and rarely <b>pelvic</b> retroperitoneum. <b>PRESENTATION</b> OF CASEA 22 -year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for a mass in the pelvic retroperitoneum that was detected incidentally on an ultrasonography during a routine medical checkup with no signs of symptoms. After laboratory examination, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), surgical resection was performed successfully through a lower midline incision. But the patient was needed transfusion because of massive bleeding. Postoperative histopathological diagnosis was hyaline-vascular type of Castleman's disease. The patient is leading an active social life without any signs of sequelae or recurrence. DISCUSSIONThrough the review of Japanese literature on Castleman's disease in the retroperitoneum, the characteristics of preoperative imaging findings are studied. Castleman's disease is easily misdiagnosed clinically because of its scarcity and no specific imaging findings. And the embolization via angiography {{should be considered in}} the hypervasular tumors such as in this case to prevent massive bleeding and transfusion. CONCLUSIONAlthough Castleman's disease is uncommon, it should always be included in the differential diagnosis of pelvic retroperitoneal tumors.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe wide use of {{laparoscopy}} for groin {{hernia repair}} has unveiled ‚Äúhidden hernias‚Äù silently residing in this area. During the open repair of the presenting hernia, the surgeon was often unaware of these occult hernias. These patients postoperatively may present with unexplained chronic groin or <b>pelvic</b> pain. <b>Presentation</b> of caseRare groin hernias are defined {{according to their}} anatomical position. Challenges in the diagnosis and management of occult rare groin hernias are discussed. These problems are illustrated by a unique case report of multiple (six) coexisting groin hernias, whereof five were occult and two were rare. DiscussionRare groin hernias are uncommon because they are difficult to diagnose clinically and are not routinely looked for. They are often occult and may coexist with other inguinal hernias, thus posing a diagnostic and treatment challenge to the surgeon, especially if there is persistent groin pain after ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù repair. MRI is the most accurate preoperative and postoperative diagnostic tool, {{if there is a}} clinical suspicion that the patient might have an occult hernia. ConclusionPreperitoneal endoscopic approach is the recommended method in confirming the diagnosis and management of occult groin hernias. A sound knowledge of groin anatomy and a thorough preperitoneal inspection of all possible sites for rare groin hernias are needed to diagnose and repair all defects. The preperitoneal mesh repair with adequate overlap of all hernia orifices is the recommended treatment of choice...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{orientation}} of acetabular component {{is influenced by}} pelvic tilt, body position and individual variation in pelvic parameters. Most post-operative adverse events {{may be attributed to}} malposition of the component in the functional position. There is evidence that {{orientation of}} the pelvis changes from the supine to standing position. Authors report a case of recurrent dislocation after total hip arthroplasty due to excessive <b>pelvic</b> tilting. <b>PRESENTATION</b> OF CASE A 69 -year old female with coxarthrosis had undergone total hip replacement with recurrent dislocation of the hip on bearing weight in spite of using constrained acetabular component. DISCUSSION: Our case report substantiates the influence of pelvic tilt, incurred by a sagittal deformity of spine, on dynamic orientation of the acetabular cup which was positioned in accordance with the anatomic landmarks alone. If the reference is only bony architecture and dynamic positions of the pelvis are not taken into account, improper functional orientation of the acetabular cup can result in sitting and standing positions. These can induce instability even in anatomically appropriately oriented acetabular component. CONCLUSION: The sagittal position of pelvis is a key factor in impingement and dislocation after total hip arthroplasty. Pelvic tilting affects the position of acetabular component in the sagittal plane of the body as compared with its anatomic position in the pelvis.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONThe {{anterior}} sagittal transrectal approach (ASTRA) {{has already}} become popular to treat lesions in the proximal urethra such as trauma, duplicity and stenosis, prostatic utricle, urethral‚Äìvaginal fistulas and urogenital sinus anomalies. It provides much better exposure {{than the traditional}} perineal approach. Morbidity caused by this technique could be potentially decreased if the anterior sagittal access were to be made without sectioning the rectum. We report our initial experience using anterior approach without rectal sectioning {{for the treatment of}} three different types of <b>pelvic</b> disorders. <b>PRESENTATION</b> OF CASEAnterior sagittal access without sectioning the rectal wall was carried out in three different clinical cases ‚Äì a vaginoplasty in a female patient with congenital adrenal hyperplasia; to treat paradoxical urinary incontinence in a patient with proximal hypospadias (46 XY karyotype) and another one with gonadal dysgenesis (46 XO/XY karyotype). DISCUSSIONSeveral surgical techniques have been reported to repair congenital or acquired lesions in the posterior urethra with high morbidity and no guarantees of adequate and safe surgical exposition. ASTRA provides an excellent exposure, splitting only the anterior rectal wall. In this study, the anterior sagittal approach was applied without splitting the rectal wall to repair different posterior urethral anomalies, providing excellent exposure without compromising the fecal continence mechanism. CONCLUSIONThe anterior sagittal approach without splitting the rectum is a feasible procedure which provides excellent exposure to the posterior urethra in most cases and leads to less morbidity as it avoids the splitting and suturing of the rectum anterior wall...|$|R

We successfully repaired the fistula by trans-perineal approach and pubo-coccygeus muscle interposition. Seven months later we can confirm the complete fistula healing and good patient's quality of life. We carefully describe our technique showing the advantages over alternative suturing, flap reconstruction or resection procedures. DISCUSSIONThis technique is fairly easy to perform and conservative. The pubo-coccygeus muscle is quickly recognizable during the dissection of the recto-vaginal space and the tension-free approximation of this muscle by single sutures represents an easy way of replacement of the recto-vaginal septum. CONCLUSIONIn our experience the use of pubo-coccygeus muscle interposition is an effective technique for rectovaginal space reconstruction and it should be considered as a viable solution for RVF repair...|$|R

This paper will set out the selection, assessment, preparation, surgery, and outcomes from pelvic exenterative surgery for locally advanced primary rectal carcinomas. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONInternal {{herniation}} of a {{small bowel}} behind pelvic vessels is a rare complication seen after <b>pelvic</b> lymphadenectomy. <b>PRESENTATION</b> OF CASEA 56 -year-old woman was operated due to a gynecological cancer. 4 years thereafter she presented with a 2 days history of abdominal pain and vomiting. Clinical and radiological findings indicated a small bowel obstruction. A loop of small bowel had herniated behind the left external iliac artery. Using laparoscopic technique the herniated bowel was reduced. Due to limited peritoneum around the area and skeletonized vessel, we decided not to do any repair of the hernia orifice. The postoperative recovery was uneventful, bowel activity returned to normal and she was discharged the next day. Follow-up was done at 1 month and the latest at 10 months. She didn‚Äôt experience pain or discomfort after the operation. DISCUSSIONDue to limited peritoneum around the skeletonized vessel, we {{decided to leave the}} hernia orifice unrepaired. We found it hazardous to do any direct suture of the orifice or use a free peritoneal graft to repair the defect as the fibrosis and inflammatory process might have compromised the artery or the vein. A longer follow-up of the patient is needed to clearly conclude if this simple procedure has been sufficient. We agreed that if the patient would experience any sign of recurrence and need another operation we would close the defect at that time. CONCLUSION 4 years after pelvic lymphadenectomy a small bowel herniation behind an external iliac artery occurred. The patient was successfully treated with reduction of the small bowel using laparoscopic technique. A quick recovery with minimal discomfort and no sign of recurrence after 10 months made our approach an acceptable surgical option...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Patients with uterine leiomyosarcoma (LMS) {{typically}} {{present with}} vaginal bleeding, pain, and a <b>pelvic</b> mass. Typical <b>presentations</b> with hypercalcemia or eosinophilia have been reported. Radiographic evaluation with combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography may {{assist in the}} diagnosis and surveillance of women with uterine LMS. A recently developed risk-assessment index is highly predictive of disease-specifi c survival. Ovarian preservation {{does not appear to}} negatively impact outcome, and the addition of adjuvant therapy after surgical treatment does not seem to improve survival. It is noteworthy that LMP 2 -defi cient mice exhibit spontaneous development of uterine LMS with a disease prevalence of ‚àº 37 % by 12 months of age. The LMP 2 gene is transcribed from a promoter containing an interferon (IFN) -Œ≥-response factor element; thus, the IFN-Œ≥-signal strongly induces LMP 2 expression. Furthermore, a recent report demonstrated the loss of ability to induce LMP 2 expression, which is an interferon (IFN) -Œ≥-inducible factor, in human uterine LMS tissues and cell lines. Analysis of human uterine LMS shows somatic mutations in the IFN-Œ≥ signalling path...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Closing the pelvic {{peritoneum}} {{to prevent}} the small bowel dropping into the pelvis after surgery for locally recurrent rectal cancer is important to prevent adhesions deep in the pelvis or complications of adjuvant radiotherapy. Achieving this could be difficult because sufficient native tissue is unavailable; {{we report on the}} use of small intestine submucosa extra-cellular matrix mesh in the obliteration of the <b>pelvic</b> brim. Case <b>presentation</b> We describe two cases in which submucosa extra-cellular matrix mesh was used to obliterate the pelvic brim following resection of a recurrent rectal tumour; the first patient, a 78 -year-old Caucasian man, presented with small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions to a recurrent rectal tumour. The second patient, an 84 -year-old Caucasian woman, presented with vaginal discharge caused by an entero-vaginal fistula due to a recurrent rectal tumour. Conclusion We report on the use of submucosa extra-cellular matrix mesh as a pelvic sling in cases where primary closure of the pelvic peritoneum is unfeasible. Its use had no infective complications and added minimal morbidity to the postoperative period. This is an original case report that would be of interest to general and colorectal surgeons. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Endometriosis is {{a common}} {{gynecological}} condition and presents mainly with involvement of the <b>pelvic</b> organs. Extrapelvic <b>presentations</b> in almost {{all parts of the}} body {{have been reported in the}} literature. However, umbilical endometriosis that is spontaneous or secondary to surgery is uncommon and accounts for only 0. 5 % to 1 % of all endometriosis cases. Case presentation A 35 -year-old Caucasian woman presented with umbilical bleeding during periods of menstruation. Her umbilicus had a small nodule with bloody discharge. An ultrasound was performed and a diagnosis of possible umbilical endometriosis was thus made. The nodule shrunk in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues but continued to persist. The patient underwent a wide local excision of the nodule with a corresponding umbilical reconstruction. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of umbilical endometriosis. The patient was asymptomatic at follow-up, but nevertheless warned of the risk of recurrence. Conclusions Pelvic endometriosis {{is a common}} condition, but the diagnosis of primary umbilical endometriosis is difficult and differentials should be considered. This case strongly suggests that a differential diagnosis of endometriosis should be considered when an umbilical swelling presents in a woman of reproductive age. </p...|$|R

A recently developed risk-assessment index is highly predictive of disease-specific survival. Ovarian preservation {{does not appear to}} negatively impact outcome, and the addition of adjuvant therapy after surgical treatment does not seem to improve survival. It is noteworthy that LMP 2 -deficient mice exhibit spontaneous development of uterine LMS with a disease prevalence of ~ 37 % by 12 months of age. The LMP 2 gene is transcribed from a promoter containing an interferon (IFN) -Œ≥-response factor element; thus, the IFN-Œ≥-signal strongly induces LMP 2 expression. Furthermore, a recent report demonstrated the loss of ability to induce LMP 2 expression, which is an interferon (IFN) - Œ≥-inducible factor, in human uterine LMS tissues and cell lines. Analysis of human uterine LMS shows somatic mutations in the IFN-Œ≥ signalling pathway, thus the loss of LMP 2 induction is attributable to a defect in the earliest steps of the IFN-Œ≥ signalling pathway. The discovery of an impaired key cell-signalling pathway may provide new targets for diagnostic approaches and therapeutic intervention...|$|R
40|$|Aims and Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the frequency and}} mode of delivery in women with one caesarean section and to evalu-ate the fetomaternal outcome of trial of labour of previous one caesarean section. Material and Methods: A trial of vaginal delivery was carried out on 100 patients in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Lahore General Hospital Lahore, Descriptive study was conducted from September 2006 to September 2007. Selection criteria were subjects with normal pregnancy, adequate maternal <b>pelvic</b> dimensions, vertex <b>presentation</b> and spon-taneous onset of labour with previous one uncomplicated LSCS. Patients with classical caesarean section, medical complica-tions, multiple pregnancy, 1 UGR, placenta previa and extensive myomectomy {{were excluded from the}} study. Informed con-sent was taken from all patients; trial of scar was given with vigilance. Maternal and fetal monitoring was carried out with facility of operation theatre, anesthesia and pediatrician. Results: Success vaginal delivery was achieved in 70 % of the patients and repeat emergency caesarean section was carried out in 30 % of the patients. Leading indication for repeat caesarean section was failure to progress, fetal distress and scar ten-derness. No maternal and fetal complication occurred. Conclusion: Trial of scar after one LSCS should be encouraged with vigilant monitoring provided no obstetric contra-indication exists...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction The deadly {{threat of}} {{systemic}} infections with coagulase negative Staphylococcus lugdunensis despite an appropriate antibiotic therapy {{has only recently}} been recognized. The predominant infectious focus observed so far is left-sided native heart valve endocarditis, but bone and soft tissue infections, septicaemia and vascular catheter-related bloodstream infections have also been reported. We present a patient with a fatal Staphylococcus lugdunensis septicaemia following zoster bacterial superinfection of the <b>pelvic</b> region. Case <b>presentation</b> A 71 -year old male diagnosed with IgG kappa plasmocytoma presented with a conspicuous weight loss, a hypercalcaemic crisis and acute renal failure. After initiation of haemodialysis treatment his condition improved rapidly. However, he developed a varicella-zoster virus infection of the twelfth thoracic dermatome requiring intravenous acyclovir treatment. Four days later the patient presented with a fulminant septicaemia. Despite an early intravenous antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/combactam and vancomycin the patient died within 48 hours, shortly before the infective isolate was identified as Staphylococcus lugdunensis by polymerase chain reaction. Conclusion Despite S. lugdunensis belonging {{to the family of}} coagulase-negative staphylococci with an usually low virulence, infections with S. lugdunensis may be associated with an aggressive course and high mortality. This is the first report on a Staphylococcus lugdunensis septicaemia following a zoster bacterial superinfection of the pelvic region. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Rectal leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is an {{extremely}} rare disease. Previously, LMS was not properly distinguishable from gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) until c-kit, a characteristic marker of GIST, was discovered in 1998. No standard therapeutic strategy for gastrointestinal LMS has been established except for surgical resection because of its rarity. Rectal LMS is often accompanied by symptoms, which can enable detection at a small size. However, when a large LMS is detected at the lower rectum, {{it is difficult to}} excise due to the narrow <b>pelvic</b> space. Case <b>presentation</b> We present the case of an 86 -year-old man with a large LMS. The LMS was asymptomatic and incidentally found at the lower rectum when he visited another hospital for management of benign prostatic hypertrophy. An abdominoperineal resection of the rectum was performed with combined resection of both seminal vesicles and a part of the prostate because tumor invasion was suspected. We used the hybrid method of laparoscopic and transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) approaches to achieve negative surgical margins. Late-onset urethral injury occurred in the postoperative course, which was successfully treated with a urethral catheter. The patient was discharged and received no adjuvant therapy. Local recurrence did not occur, but multiple lung metastases were detected 40 months later and the patient died 120 months after the surgery. Conclusions This is the first report of the hybrid method of laparoscopic and TaTME approaches to remove a large LMS at the lower rectum...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Ruptured renal {{neoplasms}} can be {{a catastrophic}} clinical presentation. Angiomyolipoma is the commonest renal tumor which presents in this fashion. Renal sarcomas are rare renal neoplasms. Renal leiomyosarcomas {{are the most common}} histological subtype of renal sarcomas, accounting for approximately 50 ‚Äì 60 % of the reported cases. These tumors are usually peripherally located and appear to arise from either the renal capsule or smooth muscle tissue in the renal <b>pelvic</b> wall. Case <b>presentation</b> A 70 years old male, with hypertension and ischemic disease, developed acute left flank pain. The general physician evaluated this using ultrasound, which showed a solid left renal mass. Two weeks later, he presented in the emergency room {{in a state of shock}} with a palpable flank mass. CT scan of the abdomen showed a large heterogeneous mass lesion in the left perinephric space with minimal post contrast enhancement. Per-operatively, large retroperitoneal hematoma was found within Gerota's fascia along with spleen plastered to the upper limit of hematoma. Nephrectomy and splenectomy were performed. Postoperative course was uneventful and patient was discharged on the 10 th post-operative day. Histopathological evaluation of the specimen showed high-grade leiomyosarcoma Conclusions Spontaneous rupture of renal neoplasm is a rare clinical presentation. Angiomyolipoma is the commonest cause of spontaneous rupture of the kidney. Presentation of a leimyosarcoma as a ruptured renal neoplasm has not been previously reported in the English literature. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Steroid cell {{tumors are}} microscopically {{characterized}} by abundant eosinophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm {{that is often}} positive for fat stains. These tumors could be of ovarian or ectopic adrenal origin. We present a rare case of a steroid cell tumor arising from the <b>pelvic</b> mesentery. Case <b>presentation</b> A 31 -year-old Asian woman was undergoing treatment for infertility and virilizing symptoms. She underwent laparoscopy followed by laprotomy for a suspected ovarian cyst/pelvic mass. During the laprotomy, a mass of 9 √ó 7 cm was detected in the pelvic mesentery. Microscopically, the tumor showed large cells arranged predominantly in sheets with abundant granular cytoplasm and large vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The tumor was seen infiltrating surrounding adipose tissue. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed strong positivity for kertain, inhibin, vimentine, melan-A, neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin, and S- 100 protein and focal positivity to epithelial membrane antigen. An MIB 1 index showed 4 % nuclear positivity. The tumor cells were negative for calretinin, desmin, and muscle actin. Considering the clinical findings, histomorphology, and immunohistochemistry, we made the diagnosis of extraovarian and extra-adrenal steroid cell tumor (not otherwise specified) of the pelvic mesentery. Conclusions We report an extremely rare case of an extraovarian and extra-adrenal steroid cell tumor of the pelvic mesentery. The tumor was a cause of virilizing symptoms and infertility in the patient. Surgical removal of the tumor reverted the symptoms of virilization, and the patient subsequently conceived. Steroid cell tumors {{should be considered in}} differential diagnosis among women presenting with infertility and symptoms of virilization. </p...|$|R
