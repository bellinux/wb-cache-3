40|$|This work {{deals with}} methodologies of {{software}} <b>development,</b> particularly <b>web</b> applications. Its main {{objective is to}} propose a methodology that helps ensure quality <b>web</b> <b>development</b> and prevents a number of frequently recurring problems. The first chapter deals with characteristics of current state and defines the need for process and discipline, the need for team development {{and the importance of}} appropriate tools. The second chapter describes the specifics of the <b>web</b> <b>development.</b> It defines the quality criteria in relation to web applications, particularly the aspects of accessibility, usability and security are concerned. It deals with web frameworks and the benefits and risks arising from their usage. It also outlines requirements for the chosen methodology <b>for</b> <b>web</b> <b>development</b> and describes types of projects to be applied to the methodology. The third chapter analyzes the suitability of the selected life cycle models and methodologies in software <b>development</b> <b>for</b> <b>web</b> applications. The life cycle models consider a model of "program and repair", the waterfall model and incremental model. It also deals with the assumptions of agile methodologies and their level of satisfaction <b>for</b> <b>web</b> <b>development.</b> <b>For</b> the analysis is used the methodology evaluation system METES with which is examined Rational Unified Process, Open Unified Process, Extreme Programming, Scrum and Feature Driven Development. The fourth chapter deals with the characteristic of Open Unified Process methodology. It describes the principles, features and development process. The main chapter deals with the proposal of methodology <b>for</b> <b>web</b> <b>development.</b> As the basis is chosen Open Unified Process methodology, whose elements are supplemented and adapted <b>for</b> <b>web</b> <b>development.</b> As the elements of the methodology are elaborated principles, practices, roles, work products, tasks, delivery process, manuals and guidelines and tools. Each element is adapted to fit the specific needs of web applications. In order to achieve greater control over the quality of web applications there are also included detailed checklists {{as an integral part of}} products which are aimed at preventing the most frequently occurring errors and problems.
