40|$|Abstract—Semantic {{networks}} (SNs) {{are excellent}} knowledge representation structures. However, large <b>semantic</b> <b>networks</b> {{are hard to}} comprehend. To overcome this difficulty, several methods of partitioning have been developed that rely on different mixes of structural and semantic methods. However, little {{has appeared in the}} literature concerning the question whether a <b>partition</b> of a <b>semantic</b> <b>network</b> creates subnetworks that agree with human insight. We address this issue by presenting a comparison between the results of an algorithmic partitioning method and a partition created by a group of experts. Subsequently, we show how a network partition can be used to generate various partial views of a <b>semantic</b> <b>network,</b> which facilitate user orientation. Examples from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) SN are used to demonstrate partial views.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a new <b>semantic</b> <b>Network</b> structure, based on the fuzzy sets theory, used in Artificial Intelligent system in order to provide effective on-line assistance to users of new technological systems. This <b>Semantic</b> <b>Networks</b> is used to describe the knowledge of an "ideal" expert while fuzzy sets are used both to describe the approximate and uncertain knowledge of novice users who intervene to match fuzzy labels of a query with categories from an "ideal" expert. The technical system we consider is a word processor software, with Objects such as "Word" and Goals such as "Cut" or "Copy". We suggest to consider the set of the system's Goals as a set of linguistic variables to which corresponds a set of possible linguistic values based on the fuzzy set. We consider, therefore, a set of interpretation's levels for these possible values to which corresponds a set of membership functions. We also propose a method to measure the similarity degree between different fuzzy linguistic variables for the <b>partition</b> of the <b>semantic</b> <b>network</b> in class of similar objects to make easy the diagnosis of the user's fuzzy queries...|$|R

40|$|Taxonomic {{hierarchical}} <b>networks</b> or <b>semantic</b> <b>networks</b> {{have been}} widely used in representing knowledge in AI applications. <b>Semantic</b> <b>networks</b> have been the preferred form of representation in AI, rather than predicate logic because of the need to represent complex, structured knowledge. However, the formal semantics of these networks has not been dealt with adequately in the literature. In this thesis, <b>semantic</b> <b>networks</b> are described by means of a formal relational logic called NVL. The characteristic features of NVL are limitor lists and binary predicates. Limitor lists are similar to restricted quantifiers but are more expressive. Several special binary relations are used to express the key ideas of <b>semantic</b> <b>networks.</b> ^ NVL is based on the principles of <b>semantic</b> <b>networks</b> and taxonomic reasoning. The unification and inference mechanisms of NVL have considerable inherent parallelism which makes the language suitable for parallel implementation. The current opinion in AI is that <b>semantic</b> <b>networks</b> represent a subset of first order logic. Rather than modify predicate logic by adding features of <b>semantic</b> <b>networks,</b> our approach has been to devise a new form of logic by considering the basic principles and epistemological primitives of <b>semantic</b> <b>networks</b> such as properties, class concepts, relations, and inheritance. Our method differs from many sorted logic in that there are only pre-determined types in many sorted logic whereas NVL accommodates not only type symbols but also other types formed by a conjunction of several properties. A property could be either a type symbol or involve a relation. ^ The syntax and semantics of NVL are first presented. It is shown that special relations are required to incorporate important features of <b>semantic</b> <b>networks.</b> Rules in the knowledge base are represented by the $V$ relation which also {{plays an important role in}} deriving inferences. The (mathematical) correctness of NVL is proved and concepts of unification of lists and inference in NVL are introduced. Parallel algorithms for unification and inference are developed. ^ NVL is based on the structured representation of knowledge and is hence more efficient than predicate logic. However, unlike other knowledge representation languages based on <b>semantic</b> <b>networks,</b> NVL has a clean, formal semantics which eliminates the confusion about what a sentence in the language really means. Finally, NVL is suitable for implementation on a highly parallel machine. ...|$|R
