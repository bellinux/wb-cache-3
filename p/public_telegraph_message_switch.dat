In 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a punched card system to control operations of the cloth weaving loom in France. It was the first use of [...] "memory storage of patterns" [...] system. As chemistry journals emerged throughout the 1820s and 1830s, Charles Babbage developed his [...] "difference engine," [...] the first step towards the modern computer, in 1822 and his [...] "analytical engine” by 1834. By 1843 Richard Hoe developed the rotary press, and in 1844 Samuel Morse sent the first <b>public</b> <b>telegraph</b> <b>message.</b> By 1848 William F. Poole begins the Index to Periodical Literature, the first general periodical literature index in the US.|$|R

50|$|The airline {{industry}} began using teletypewriter {{technology in the}} early 1920s using radio stations located at 10 airfields in the United States. The US Post Office and other US government agencies used these radio stations for transmitting <b>telegraph</b> <b>messages.</b> It was during this period that the first federal teletypewriter system {{was introduced in the}} United States to allow weather and flight information to be exchanged between air traffic facilities. While the use of physical teletypes is almost extinct, the <b>message</b> formats and <b>switching</b> concepts remain similar.|$|R

50|$|A <b>message</b> <b>switch</b> is “transactional”. It {{can store}} data or change its format and bit rate, then convert the data {{back to their}} {{original}} form or an entirely different form at the receive end. <b>Message</b> <b>switching</b> multiplexes data from different sources onto a common facility.A <b>message</b> <b>switch</b> {{is one of the}} switching technologies.This system is very powerful and efficient.|$|R
5000|$|A {{telegraph}} sounder is {{an antique}} electromechanical device {{used as a}} receiver on electrical telegraph lines during the 19th century. It was invented by Alfred Vail after 1850 to replace the previous receiving device, the cumbersome Morse register {{and was the first}} practical application of the electromagnet. When a <b>telegraph</b> <b>message</b> comes in it produces an audible [...] "clicking" [...] sound representing the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of Morse code. A telegraph operator would translate the sounds into characters representing the <b>telegraph</b> <b>message.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 1874, <b>telegraph</b> <b>message</b> {{traffic was}} rapidly {{expanding}} {{and in the}} words of Western Union President William Orton, had become [...] "the nervous system of commerce". Orton had contracted with inventors Thomas Edison and Elisha Gray {{to find a way to}} send multiple <b>telegraph</b> <b>messages</b> on each <b>telegraph</b> line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines. When Bell mentioned to Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device, the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's experiments. Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard's patent attorney, Anthony Pollok.|$|R

40|$|Modula {{is a new}} {{programming}} language for implementing dedicated, parallel systems. Following a systematic design technique, this paper illustrates the use of Modula {{for the design of}} a <b>message</b> <b>switching</b> communication system. A <b>message</b> <b>switching</b> system poses a number of interesting problems: a high degree of concurrent activity exists, a variety of IO devices need to be controlled, messages can have multiple destinations, and messages can be preempted. The strengths and weaknesses of Modula with respect to these specific problems and its utility as a general purpose language are evaluated.
