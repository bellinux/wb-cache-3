2500|$|Windows XP Service Pack 2, {{which was}} {{released}} in August 2004 {{after a number of}} delays, also contained a number of security-related fixes, new restrictions on code execution, and user interface elements that aimed to better protect the user from malware. [...] One notable user interface element that was introduced was the [...] "information bar". [...] Tony Schriner, a developer on the Internet Explorer team, explained that the information bar was introduced to reduce the possibility that the user might mis-click and allow the installation of software they did not intend, as well as to simply reduce the number of pop-ups displayed to the user. [...] Most reviews of this release focused on the addition of the <b>pop-up</b> <b>blocker,</b> as it had been seen as a major omission at a time when pop-up ads had become a major source of irritation for web users.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{circumvent}} these <b>pop-up</b> <b>blockers,</b> some online advertisers tried a different method of opening pop-ups, Dynamic HTML, {{which is more}} integral to the functioning of a web-browser and thus harder to block.|$|R
5000|$|All major web browsers {{allow the}} user to open {{multiple}} information resources at the same time, either in different browser windows or in different tabs of the same window.

Users can log into their Gmail accounts and access their email, saved bookmarks, and web history. It has tools such as AutoLink, AutoFill, Translation, spell checker common to all browsers, while <b>pop-up</b> <b>blocker</b> and word finder are restricted to Internet Explorer. Google Toolbar is often distributed through product bundling with a primary download.|$|E
50|$|As Camino's {{aim was to}} {{integrate}} as well as possible with OS X, it used the Aqua user interface and integrated a number of OS X services and features such as the Keychain for password management and Bonjour for scanning available bookmarks across the local network. Other notable features included an integrated <b>pop-up</b> <b>blocker</b> and ad blocker, and tabbed browsing that included an overview feature allowing tabs to be viewed all at once as pages.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its purported operation as an antivirus program, the software floods users with multiple false security warnings about threats {{to the security of}} files on the computer, overwhelming <b>pop-up</b> <b>blockers</b> such as Norton Antivirus. The software may also alter the operation of screen savers, desktop, and desktop icons, directing users to the software's homepage.|$|R
5000|$|Pop-up ads {{acquired}} a certain share of online advertising solutions and technologies. The first Internet pop-ups were created using the [...] JavaScript function, which opens a new browser window. The advertising content {{was presented in}} the window as HTML content loaded from a web address. These pop-ups were easily blocked by <b>pop-up</b> <b>blockers,</b> such as the Google Toolbar, which could be downloaded at no cost.|$|R
50|$|An {{early use}} of the splash screen on a Flash website was to enable the site {{developer}} to launch the site in a JavaScript-controlled new window without browser elements such as scroll-bars or an address bar, and in the exact size of the Flash movie. This {{has gone out of}} style with the predominance of <b>pop-up</b> <b>blockers.</b> Instead many starting Flash web pages now allow their audience to choose to go to full screen viewing.|$|R

50|$|The first browser {{war ended}} with Internet Explorer having no {{remaining}} serious competition for its market share. This also brought {{an end to}} the rapid innovation in web browsers; until 2006 there was only one new version of Internet Explorer since version 6.0 had been released in 2001. Internet Explorer 6.0 Service Pack 1 was developed as part of Windows XP Service Pack 1 and was also integrated into Windows Server 2003. Further enhancements were made to Internet Explorer in Windows XP Service Pack 2 (released in 2004), including a <b>pop-up</b> <b>blocker</b> and stronger default security settings regarding the installation of ActiveX controls.|$|E

50|$|A hover ad uses DHTML {{to combine}} a banner ad and a popup window {{that appears in}} front of the browser screen. JavaScript imposes an {{advertisement}} over a webpage in a transparent layer. This advertisement can appear in a variety of forms. For example, an advertisement can contain an Adobe Flash animation that links to the advertiser's site. An advertisement can also look like a regular window. <b>Pop-up</b> <b>blockers</b> can't block the ad because it's a part of the web page, but it can be blocked with third-party ad blockers such as AdBlock and Adblock Plus, or by using custom style sheets.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{the browser}} {{includes}} a <b>pop-up</b> advertisement <b>blocker</b> {{which can be}} configured to allow pop-ups for individual sites, block only unrequested pop-ups, and open any pop-ups in new tabs in one window, thus preventing pop-unders.|$|R
50|$|Service Pack 2 (SP2) was {{released}} on August 25, 2004, SP2 added new functionality to Windows XP, such as WPA encryption compatibility and improved Wi-Fi support (with a wizard utility), a <b>pop-up</b> ad <b>blocker</b> for Internet Explorer 6, and partial Bluetooth support.|$|R
5000|$|Netscape 7.0 (codenamed [...] "Mach Five" [...] {{and based}} on Mozilla 1.0.1) was {{released}} in August 2002 was a direct continuation of Netscape 6 with very similar components. It picked up a few users, but was {{still very much a}} minority browser, one of the problems being that Mozilla itself was a worthy adversary. In addition, AOL had decided to deactivate Mozilla's popup-blocker functionality in Netscape 7.0, which created an outrage in the community. In response to the complaints, AOL integrated the <b>pop-up</b> <b>blocker</b> into Netscape 7.01. In addition, Netscape introduced a new AOL-free-version (without the usual AOL addons) of the browser suite.

Dvorak.) Also, the pop ups sometimes look like ordinary web pages, {{and the name of}} the site shows up in a search bar. Many websites use pop-ups to display information without disrupting the page currently open. For example, if you were to fill in a form on a web page and needed extra guidance, a pop-up would give you extra information without causing loss of any information already entered into the form. Most <b>pop-up</b> <b>blockers</b> allow this kind of pop-up. Some, however, reload the page, losing any information the user entered.|$|R
5000|$|Seekmo is an adware {{program by}} Zango that {{claimed to be}} a free tool to provide content such as mp3 files, screen savers, and videos. Seekmo can pop up {{advertisements}} even when users have <b>pop-up</b> <b>blockers</b> on their computers, and monitors computer usage to generate ads that users are more likely to respond to. In the process, the program can consume processing power and network bandwidth, slowing down the computer and interrupting other programs. Upon downloading a Seekmo-containing file, license acquisition will begin and the program (Windows Media Player, for example) will display a window describing the content and what Seekmo is. Upon clicking [...] "Accept", it will automatically send a file for download called [...] "Setup.exe". After downloading this file users must install the Seekmo Toolbar, which will display advertisements related to the websites visited.

2500|$|The {{implementation}} of affiliate marketing {{on the internet}} relies heavily on various techniques built into the design of many web-pages and web-sites, {{and the use of}} calls to external domains to track user actions (click tracking, Ad Sense) and to serve up content (advertising) to the user. Most of this activity adds time [...] and is generally a nuisance to the casual web-surfer and is seen as visual clutter. [...] Various countermeasures have evolved over time to prevent or eliminate the appearance of advertising when a web-page is rendered. Third party programs (Ad-Aware, Adblock Plus, Spybot, <b>pop-up</b> <b>blockers,</b> etc.) and particularly, the use of a comprehensive HOSTS file can effectively eliminate the visual clutter and the extra time and bandwidth needed to render many web pages. [...] The use of specific entries in the HOSTS file to block these well-known and persistent marketing and click-tracking domains can also aid in reducing a system's exposure to malware by preventing the content of infected advertising or tracking servers to reach a user's web-browser.|$|R

As its popularity increases, more attention to its features is inevitable. This report will feature an analysis on its <b>pop-up</b> <b>blocker,</b> JavaScript blocker, sandboxing feature, safe browsing, and auto-update process. The <b>pop-up</b> <b>blocker</b> is tested for its thoroughness and if a bypass is possible. JavaScript is analyzed on specific usages in different websites. Sandboxing is explained and a work-around is looked upon. Chrome’s safe browsing design and updating process is examined and possible design improvements are searched into. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{we present}} a Flow Stealing attack, where a victim’s browser is {{redirected}} during a legitimate flow. One scenario is redirecting the victim’s browser as it moves from a store to a payment provider. We discuss two attack vectors. Firstly, browsers have long admitted an attack allowing a malicious web page to detect whether the browser has visited a target web site by using CSS to style visited links and read out the style applied to a link. For a long time, this CSS history detection attack was perceived as having small impact. Lately, highly efficient implementations of the attack have enabled malicious web sites to extract large amounts of information. Following this, browser developers have deployed measures {{to protect against the}} attack. Flow stealing demonstrates that the impact of history detection is greater than previously known. Secondly, an attacker who can mount a man-in-the-middle attack against the victim’s network traffic can also perform a flow stealing attack. Noting that different browsers place different restrictions on cross-frame navigation through JavaScript window handles, we suggest a stricter policy based on <b>pop-up</b> <b>blockers</b> to prevent Flow Stealing attacks...|$|R

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE RESEARCH PAPER OF Korey C. Love, for the Masters of Science {{degree in}} MEDIA MANAGEMENT, {{presented}} on OCTOBER 29 th, 2015, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL ADVERTISING THROUGH FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTARGAM MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Katherine Frith Social media has quickly evolved {{into one of}} the most popular channels of communication this generation has ever seen. This is why it is essential to map its progressive journey from where it first started, to what it has become in today’s world. Advertising methods were quickly integrated into social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram so that they could evolve into what they have today, and to provide million upon billions of connections for companies and agencies to engage with their sought after consumers. There are a plethora of advertising options offered on these three different social media websites, which give the lone individual up to the Fortune 500 Company options to customize their impression on the consumer. However some social media outlets stand apart from the rest by the way of success and innovation. It is clear that the different websites have had various effects on the consumer, some great and some bad. It was imperative that the effectiveness of these social media websites and their advertising methods be tested in order to evaluate the results on the consumer. After researching the development of the three most popular social media sites (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) a focus group of three male and three female participants between the ages of 20 - 24 was conducted in order to assess the three social media websites. The participants were asked several questions focusing on social advertising through these websites, as well as interacting with each other and providing key insights about their personal social media usage. The focus group concluded that Instagram was the most innovative when it came to integrating their advertisements directly into the timeline of the user. Facebook clearly had the most forms of advertising, however participants were not pleased with the amount of ads and had to use <b>pop-up</b> <b>blocker</b> in tandem with their application use. Twitter was said to be user friendly. Recently though, more forms of aggressive ads have been added to Twitter’s real-time user feeds. The participants made several predictions about future social media trends and advertising, the most imminent being that Facebook would begin to model some of their advertising methods after Instagram, a company they recently acquired in 2012. In conclusion, Instagram was said to be the most visually stunning and inventive when it came to advertising method and incorporation...|$|E
40|$|Ajax, {{shorthand}} for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a web development technique for creating interactive web applications. The {{intent is to}} make web pages feel more responsive by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes, so that the entire web page {{does not have to}} be reloaded each time the user requests a change. This is meant to increase the web page's interactivity, speed, and usability. However, there are several common mistakes using it, like: using Axaj just for the sake of Ajax, moreover the back button of the browser become unuseful, there might be a delay displaying enhanced GUI widgets, offline content is not supported, concurrent page loading is dramatically slowed down, sensitive information might be sent encrypted, cross-browser implementation is not one of developers primary concerns, concurrent access is not well supported, running the entire application on the client side makes it slower, there is no support for user without a JavaScript enable browser, GUI might change unexpectedly, there are no URLs which may be referred and indexed by users and search engines, <b>pop-up</b> <b>blockers</b> might kill opening windows, there are a lot of asynchronous operations happening in the background which might be difficult to be controlled, inventing new controls which are less intuitive than the classic ones, style and internationalization issues due to partial page rendering, the lack of data posted back from the user, Web traffic cannot be reported for each section of a given site.
