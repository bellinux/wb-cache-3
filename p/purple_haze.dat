This game is used {{to raise money for}} the Starlight Children's Foundation. After the guernsey re-design to a predominately purple home jumper, Fremantle wore the starlight foundation logo, a yellow star, above the highest chevron for their <b>Purple</b> <b>Haze</b> game.|$|E

500|$|Gizmodo editor Diaz {{discussed}} the correspondence between Apple and a reader about purple flare in pictures taken on iPhone 5 camera. Apple's {{response to the}} issue was that it is normal and advised the customer to aim the camera away from bright light sources when taking photos. Tests conducted by TechCrunch indicate that the problem existed on the iPhone 4S but was more distinct and pronounced on the iPhone 5. Consumer Reports found that the <b>purple</b> <b>haze</b> effect occurred on several other manufacturers' phones including the Samsung Galaxy S III and Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, {{and that it was}} not less pronounced on the iPhone 4S. [...] The report concluded that digital cameras in general, including higher-end SLRs, can all suffer from lens flare in which a purple-tinted effect was not uncommon.|$|E

60|$|Out beyond, {{the boats}} were at anchor, {{floating}} as gracefully on the twinkling water as sea birds, their tall masts bowing landward on the swell. A lazy, dreamful calm had fallen over the distant seas; the horizon blues were pale and dim; faint <b>purple</b> <b>hazes</b> blurred {{the outlines of}} far-off headlands and cliffs; the yellow sands sparkled in the sunshine as if powdered with jewels.|$|R
60|$|And {{the evening}} before last we had a {{gorgeous}} Arizona riot in the west. Bastioned upon the ocean cloud-tier was piled upon cloud-tier, spacious and lofty, until we gazed upon a Grand Canyon a myriad times vaster and more celestial {{than that of the}} Colorado. The clouds took on the same stratified, serrated, rose-rock formation, and all the hollows were filled with the opal blues and <b>purple</b> <b>hazes</b> of the Painted Lands.|$|R
60|$|That September was a {{month of}} golden mists and <b>purple</b> <b>hazes</b> at Four Winds Harbor--{{a month of}} sun-steeped days and of nights that were {{swimming}} in moonlight, or pulsating with stars. No storm marred it, no rough wind blew. Anne and Gilbert put their nest in order, rambled on the shores, sailed on the harbor, drove about Four Winds and the Glen, or through the ferny, sequestered roads of the woods around the harbor head; in short, had such a honeymoon as any lovers in the world might have envied them.|$|R
2500|$|Eastman Kodak {{introduced}} its own system of pre-tinted black-and-white film stocks called Sonochrome in 1929.

60|$|The {{night was}} even blacker {{than we had}} anticipated; there was no trace of a moon; and the dark <b>purple</b> <b>haze,</b> {{sometimes}} encountered at night near the Line, half shrouded the stars from view.|$|E
60|$|The {{fourth day}} {{we got on}} so nicely that it was quite monotonous. The sun shone, the chinook blew, our ponies trotted over the trail gallantly. Kate and I sang, told stories, and laughed immoderately over everything. Even a poor joke {{seems to have a}} subtle flavour on the prairie. For the first time I began to think Saskatchewan beautiful, with those {{far-reaching}} parklike meadows dotted with the white-stemmed poplars, the distant bluffs bannered with the airiest of <b>purple</b> <b>hazes,</b> and the little blue lakes that sparkled and shimmered in the sunlight on every hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "In November I {{sometimes}} {{feel as if}} spring could never come again," [...] she sighed, grieving over the hopeless unsightliness of her frosted and bedraggled flower-plots. The gay little garden of the schoolmaster's bride was rather a forlorn place now, and the Lombardies and birches were under bare poles, as Captain Jim said. But the fir-wood behind the little house was forever green and staunch; and even in November and December there came gracious days of sunshine and <b>purple</b> <b>hazes,</b> when the harbor danced and sparkled as blithely as in midsummer, and the gulf was so softly blue and tender that the storm and the wild wind seemed only things of a long-past dream.|$|R
60|$|October {{that year}} {{gathered}} {{up all the}} spilled sunshine of the summer and clad herself in it as in a garment. The Story Girl had asked us {{to try to make}} the last month together beautiful, and Nature seconded our efforts, giving us that most beautiful of beautiful things--a gracious and perfect moon of falling leaves. There was not in all that vanished October one day that did not come in with auroral splendour and go out attended by a fair galaxy of evening stars--not a day when there were not golden lights in the wide pastures and <b>purple</b> <b>hazes</b> in the ripened distances. Never was anything so gorgeous as the maple trees that year. Maples are trees that have primeval fire in their souls. It glows out a little in their early youth, before the leaves open, in the redness and rosy-yellowness of their blossoms, but in summer it is carefully hidden under a demure, silver-lined greenness. Then when autumn comes, the maples give up trying to be sober and flame out in all the barbaric splendour and gorgeousness of their real nature, making of the hills things out of an Arabian Nights dream in the golden prime of good Haroun Alraschid.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Price {{has been}} {{nominated}} to fill Deacon Lysander Richardson's shoes in the following manner: One day in the late autumn {{a man in a}} coonskin cap stops beside Mr. Price's woodpile, where Mr. Price has been chopping wood, pausing occasionally to stare off through the <b>purple</b> <b>haze</b> at the south shoulder of Coniston Mountain.|$|E
60|$|Martin Eden nodded. He {{had caught}} a glimpse of the {{apparently}} illimitable vistas of knowledge. What he saw took on tangibility. His abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form. In the alchemy of his brain, trigonometry and mathematics and the whole field of knowledge which they betokened were transmuted into so much landscape. The vistas he saw were vistas of green foliage and forest glades, all softly luminous or shot through with flashing lights. In the distance, detail was veiled and blurred by a <b>purple</b> <b>haze,</b> but behind this <b>purple</b> <b>haze,</b> he knew, was the glamour of the unknown, the lure of romance. It was like wine to him. Here was adventure, something to do with head and hand, a world to conquer--and straightway from the back of his consciousness rushed the thought, conquering, to win to her, that lily- pale spirit sitting beside him.|$|E
60|$|Imagination had {{pictured the}} desert {{for me as}} a vast, sandy plain, flat and monotonous. Reality showed me desolate {{mountains}} gleaming bare in the sun, long lines of red bluffs, white sand dunes, and hills of blue clay, areas of level ground--in all, a many-hued, boundless world in itself, wonderful and beautiful, fading all around into the <b>purple</b> <b>haze</b> of deceiving distance.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was about}} {{the middle of the}} afternoon, and {{intensely}} warm and breathless. The headlands and coves were blurred by a <b>purple</b> heat <b>haze.</b> The long sweep of the sandshore was so glaringly brilliant that the pained eye sought relief among the rough rocks, where shadows were cast by the big red sandstone boulders. The little cluster of fishing houses nearby were bleached to a silvery grey by long exposure to wind and rain. Far off were several [...] "Yankee" [...] fishing schooners, their sails dimly visible against the white horizon.|$|R
60|$|But Chester was off. Walk five miles! Pooh! He {{could walk}} twenty with hope to lure him on. Albemarle Street finally frayed {{off into a}} real country road. Chester was glad to find himself {{out in the country}} once more, with the great golden fields basking on either side and the wooded hills beyond, <b>purple</b> with <b>haze.</b> He had grown to hate the town with its cold, unheeding faces. It was good to breathe clear air again and feel the soft, springy soil of the ferny {{roadside}} under his tired little feet.|$|R
60|$|He {{was very}} right. The <b>purple</b> and lemon-coloured <b>hazes</b> of dusk and {{reflected}} day {{spread over the}} throbbing, twinkling streets, masked the great outline of the citadel and the desert hills, and conspired to confuse and suggest and evoke memories, till Cairo the Sorceress cast her proper shape and danced before me in the heartbreaking likeness of every city I had known and loved, a little farther up the road.|$|R
60|$|The night wore on, hour by hour. The {{courthouse}} clock {{rang out}} one single deep mellow clang. One o'clock! Lane thrilled to the sound. It {{brought back the}} school days, the vacation days, the Indian summer days when the hills were golden and the <b>purple</b> <b>haze</b> hung over the land--the days that were {{to be no more}} for Daren Lane.|$|E
6000|$|... [p.9]of {{industry}} {{which kept}} us at anchor off the Isle of Wight, through the loveliest {{air of the}} Inland Sea, whose sparkling blue and <b>purple</b> <b>haze</b> spread charms even on N. Africa's beldame features, {{and now we are}} sitting silent and still, listening to the monotonous melody of the East-the soft night-breeze wandering through starlit skies and tufted trees, with a voice of melancholy meaning.|$|E
60|$|The Grand Canyon of Arizona is {{over two}} hundred miles long, {{thirteen}} wide, and {{a mile and a}} half deep; a titanic gorge in which mountains, tablelands, chasms and cliffs lie half veiled in <b>purple</b> <b>haze.</b> It is wild and sublime, a thing of wonder, of mystery; beyond all else a place to grip the heart of a man, to unleash his daring spirit.|$|E
6000|$|... 88. Perhaps {{there is}} no more {{impressive}} scene on earth than the solitary extent of the Campagna of Rome under evening light. Let the reader imagine himself for a moment withdrawn from the sounds and motion of the living world, and sent forth alone into this wild and wasted plain. The earth yields and crumbles beneath his foot, tread he never so lightly, for its substance is white, hollow, and carious, like the dusty wreck of the bones of men. The long knotted grass waves and tosses feebly in the evening wind, and the shadows of its motion shake feverishly along the banks of ruin that lift themselves to the sunlight. Hillocks of mouldering earth heave around him, as if the dead beneath were struggling in their sleep. Scattered blocks of black stone, four-square remnants of mighty edifices, not one left upon another, lie upon them to keep them down. A dull <b>purple</b> poisonous <b>haze</b> stretches level along the desert, veiling its spectral wrecks of massy ruins, on whose rents the red light rests, like dying fire on defiled altars; the blue ridge of the Alban Mount lifts itself against a solemn space of green, clear, quiet sky. Watch-towers of dark clouds stand steadfastly along the promontories of the Apennines. From the plain to the mountains, the shattered aqueducts, pier beyond pier, melt into the darkness, like shadowy and countless troops of funeral mourners, passing from a nation's grave.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{afterward}} {{he was riding}} Nack-yal on the rough and winding trail up through the broken country of cliffs and cañon to the great league-long sage and cedar slope of the mountain. It was weeks since he had ridden the mustang. Nack-yal was fat and lazy. He loved his master, {{but he did not}} like the climb, and so fell far behind the lean and wiry pony that carried Nas Ta Bega. The sage levels were as <b>purple</b> as the <b>haze</b> of the distance, and there was a bitter-sweet tang on the strong, cool wind. The sun was gold behind the dark line of fringe on the mountain-top. A flock of sheep swept down one of the sage levels, looking like a narrow stream of white and black and brown. It was always amazing for Shefford to see how swiftly these Navajo sheep grazed along. Wild mustangs plunged out of the cedar clumps and stood upon the ridges, whistling defiance or curiosity, and their manes and tails waved in the wind.|$|R
6000|$|Then methought I heard a mellow sound, [...] Gathering up {{from all}} the lower ground; [2] [...] Narrowing in to where they sat {{assembled}} [...] Low voluptuous music winding trembled, [...] Wov'n in circles: they that heard it sigh'd, [...] Panted {{hand in hand with}} faces pale, [...] Swung themselves, and in low tones replied; [...] Till the fountain spouted, showering wide [...] Sleet of diamond-drift and pearly hail; [...] Then the music touch'd the gates and died; [...] Rose again from where it seem'd to fail, [...] Storm'd in orbs of song, a growing gale; [...] Till thronging in and in, to where they waited, [...] As 'twere a hundred-throated nightingale, [...] The strong tempestuous treble throbb'd and palpitated; [...] Ran into its giddiest whirl of sound, [...] Caught the sparkles, and in circles, [...] <b>Purple</b> gauzes, golden <b>hazes,</b> liquid mazes, [...] Flung the torrent rainbow round: [...] Then they started from their places, [...] Moved with violence, changed in hue, [...] Caught each other with wild grimaces, [...] Half-invisible to the view, [...] Wheeling with precipitate paces [...] To the melody, till they flew, [...] Hair, and eyes, and limbs, and faces, [...] Twisted hard in fierce embraces, [...] Like to Furies, like to Graces, [...] Dash'd together in blinding dew: [...] Till, kill'd with some luxurious agony, [...] The nerve-dissolving melody [...] Flutter'd headlong from the sky.|$|R
60|$|And in {{all that}} mighty sweep of earth he saw no sign of man nor of the handiwork of man--save only the torn bosom of the {{hillside}} at his feet. The man looked long and carefully. Once, far down his own canyon, {{he thought he saw}} in the air a faint hint of smoke. He looked again and decided that it was the <b>purple</b> <b>haze</b> of the hills made dark by a convolution of the canyon wall at its back.|$|E
60|$|Lucifer {{exploded}} with an {{oath and}} leapt erect, leaning hard upon the handle that {{acted as a}} helm to the vessel. For the last ten minutes they had been shooting downwards into great cracks and caverns of cloud. Now, through a sort of <b>purple</b> <b>haze,</b> could be seen comparatively near to them {{what seemed to be}} the upper part of a huge, dark orb or sphere, islanded in a sea of cloud. The Professor's eyes were blazing like a maniac's.|$|E
60|$|They {{stood still}} and {{prepared}} to bid each other farewell. Everything before them was on a perfect level. The sun, resting on the horizon line, streamed across the ground from between copper-coloured and lilac clouds, stretched out in flats beneath a sky of pale soft green. All dark objects on the earth that lay towards the sun were overspread by a <b>purple</b> <b>haze,</b> against which groups of wailing gnats shone out, rising upwards and dancing about like sparks of fire.|$|E
6000|$|... § 26. This decided {{love of the}} slope, or bank {{above the}} wall, rather than below it, is one of Turner's most marked idiosyncrasies, and gives a {{character}} to his composition, as distinguished from that of other men, perhaps more marked than any which are traceable in other features of it (except, perhaps, in his pear-shaped ideal of trees, of which more hereafter). For when mountains are striking to the general eye, they almost always have the high crest or wall of cliff {{on the top of}} their slopes, rising from the plain first in mounds of meadow-land, and bosses of rock, and studded softness of forest; the brown cottages peeping through grove above grove, until just where the deep shade of the pines becomes blue or <b>purple</b> in the <b>haze</b> of height, a red wall of upper precipice rises from the pasture land, and frets the sky with glowing serration. Plate +40+, opposite, represents a mass of mountain just above Villeneuve, {{at the head of the}} Lake of Geneva, in which the type of the structure is shown with singular clearness. Much of the scenery of western Switzerland, and characteristically the whole of that of Savoy, is composed of mountains of this kind; the isolated group between Chambery and Grenoble, which holds the Grande Chartreuse in the heart of it, is constructed entirely of such masses; and the Montagne de Vergi, which in like manner encloses the narrow meadows and traceried cloisters of the Convent of the Réposoir, forms the most striking feature among all the mountains that border the valley of the Arve between Cluse and Geneva; while ranges of cliffs presenting precisely the same typical characters frown above the bridge and fortress of Mont-Meillan, and enclose, in light blue calm, the waters of the Lake of Annecy.|$|R
6000|$|Hodder {{looked at}} his watch, only to be {{reminded}} poignantly of the chief cause of his heaviness of spirit, for it represented concretely the affections of those whom he had left behind; brought before him vividly the <b>purple</b> <b>haze</b> of the Bremerton valley, and the garden party, in the ample Whitely grounds, which was their tribute to him. And he beheld, moving from the sunlight to shadow, the figure of Rachel Ogden. She might have been with him now, speeding by his side into the larger life! ...|$|E
60|$|A September sun, {{losing some}} of its heat if not its brilliance, was {{dropping}} low in the west over the black Colorado range. <b>Purple</b> <b>haze</b> began to thicken in the timbered notches. Gray foothills, round and billowy, rolled down from the higher country. They were smooth, sweeping, with long velvety slopes and isolated patches of aspens that blazed in autumn gold. Splotches of red vine colored the soft gray of sage. Old White Slides, a mountain scarred by avalanche, towered with bleak rocky peak above the valley, sheltering it from the north.|$|E
