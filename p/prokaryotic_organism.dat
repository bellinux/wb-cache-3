40|$|AbstractThe {{heat shock}} protein (Hsp) HtpG {{is a member of}} the Hsp 90 protein family. We cloned a single-copy gene {{encoding}} a homologue of HtpG from the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942. Sequence alignment with HtpGs from other prokaryotes revealed unique features in the cyanobacterial HtpG primary sequence. A monocistronic mRNA of the htpG gene increased transiently in response to heat shock. In order to elucidate the role of HtpG in vivo, we inactivated the htpG gene by targeted mutagenesis. Although the mutation did not affect the photoautotrophic growth at 30 and 42 °C, the mutant cells were unable to grow at 45 °C. They lost both basal and acquired thermotolerances. These results indicate that HtpG plays an essential role for the thermal stress management in cyanobacteria, the first such an example for either a photosynthetic or a <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>organism...</b>|$|E
40|$|The nitrogen-fixing {{filamentous}} cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 {{is being}} used as a simple model of microbial development and pattern formation in a multicellular <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>organism.</b> Anabaena reduces atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia in highly specialized, terminally differentiated cells called heterocysts. Anabaena is an important model system because of the multicellular growth pattern, the suspected antiquity of heterocyst development, and the contribution of fixed nitrogen to the environment. We are especially interested in understanding the molecular signaling pathways and genetic regulation that control heterocyst development. In the presence of an external source of reduced nitrogen, the differentiation of heterocysts is inhibited. When Anabaena is grown on dinitrogen, a one-dimensional developmental pattern of single heterocysts separated by approximately ten vegetative cells is established to form a multicellular organism composed of two interdependent cell types. The goal of this project is to understand the signaling and regulatory pathways that commit a vegetative cell to terminally differentiate into a nitrogen-fixing heterocyst. Several genes identified by us and by others were chosen as entry points into the regulatory network. Our research, which was initially focused on transcriptional regulation by group 2 sigma factors, was expanded to include group 3 sigma factors and their regulators after the complete Anabaena genome sequence became available. Surprisingly, no individual sigma factor is essential for heterocyst development. We have used the isolation of extragenic suppressors to study genetic interactions between key regulatory genes such as patS, hetR, and hetC in signaling and developmental pathways. We identified a hetR R 223 W mutation as a bypass suppressor of patS overexpression. Strains containing the hetR R 223 W allele fail to respond to pattern formation signals and overexpression of this allele results in a lethal phenotype because all cells differentiate a few days after nitrogen step-down. Our continued analysis of these genes will provide {{a better understanding of how}} a simple <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>organism</b> can perform both photosynthetic carbon fixation and nitrogen fixation simultaneously by separating these processes in different cell types...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Life {{on earth}} is {{strongly}} affected by the day-night cycle, {{also known as the}} diurnal cycle. Due to its importance in survival, many organisms have developed an internal time keeping mechanism that goes by the name of circadian rhythm. Light plays a vital role for photosynthetic cyanobacteria and changes in the light pattern result in adaptive changes in the underlying biological processes at cellular level. Processes under circadian control are able to maintain their rhythm even under changes in the diurnal cycle, and it is important to isolate these processes from those whose rhythms are strongly affected by light. As the only known <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>organism</b> to have a robust circadian clock mechanism, cyanobacteria provide us with a unique opportunity to unveil the complex changes, especially changes in the process rhythms resulting from perturbation of the diurnal cycle. In this paper, we have identified the circadian controlled genes from those that are strongly influenced by light using a pair of genome wide study utilizing microarrays. A transcription model with an associated regulatory network is proposed. Index Terms—oscillation, circadian rhythm, diurnal, gene, regulatory networ...|$|E

40|$|Twin-arginine {{targeting}} (Tat) protein secretion systems {{consist of}} two protein types, {{members of the}} TatA and TatC families. Homologues of these proteins are found in many archaea, bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria. Every <b>prokaryotic</b> <b>organism</b> with a fully sequenced genome exhibits either neither family member, or between one and three paralogues of these two family members. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes three of each. Although many mitochondrially encoded TatC homologues have been identified, corresponding TatA homologues have not been found in this organelle. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that most prokaryotic Tat systems consist of one TatC homologue and two sequence-divergent TatA homologues (TatA and TatB). When only one TatA homologue is present, TatB is missing, and when three TatA homologues are present, the third one arose by duplication of TatA, not TatB. Further, homologues most resembling TatB are more sequence-divergent than those more closely resembling TatA.
