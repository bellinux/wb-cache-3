40|$|Abstract: Seismic hazard results (levels and scenarios) {{obtained}} for a site located {{close to a}} <b>potentially</b> <b>active</b> <b>fault</b> segment of the Durance fault system, southeast France, depend strongly on the assumed seismicity rates of intermediate magnitude events. We consider here three time-independent recurrence models: Gutenberg-Richter, Young-Coppersmith and Maximum Earthquake for the probability density function on magnitude and different slip rate estimates and historical seismicity to estimate the earthquake occurrence rates. We only consider M≥ 5 events in hazard calculations. The model producing {{the highest rate of}} intermediate magnitude events leads systematically to higher hazard levels and lower magnitude scenarios. The integration of the aleatory variability of ground motion prediction equations in the hazard calculation leads naturally to this result. Additional geological criteria indicative of the earthquake frequency-size potential of faults is necessary in order to reduce uncertainty in the modeling of intermediate magnitude events, potentially important contributors to seismic hazard estimates close to faults. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. ERTS- 1 imagery covering the eastern California-Nevada seismic belt were utilized {{to study the}} fault pattern {{in relation to the}} distribution of earthquake epicenters and Quaternary volcanic rocks. Many suspected faults not previously mapped were identified. These include several suspected shear zones in Nevada, faults showing evidence of recent breakage, and major lineaments. Highly seismic areas are generally characterized by Holocene faulting and Quaternary volcanic activity. However, several major fault segments showing evidence of recent breakage are associated with little or no seismicity. The tectonic pattern strongly suggests that the eastern California-Nevada seismic belt coincides with a major crustal rift associated with zones of lateral shear.

30|$|The {{regional}} {{stress field}} {{along with the}} local stress perturbations provides invaluable information to understand the seismic hazard of a region under investigation and help to localize {{the sources of the}} tectonic driving forces (Stefanik and Jurdy 1992). In such studies, earthquake focal mechanisms and microtectonic field observations are widely used to retrieve the stress tensor parameters (Zoback 1993; Pinar et al. 2003, 2010; Över et al. 2013). On the other hand, the Coulomb failure criteria point out that the orientation of the maximum compressive stress axis and the strike of the <b>potentially</b> <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> are interconnected through the frictional coefficient of faults (King et al. 1994; Iio 1997). Thus, the orientation of the <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> in a region along with the stress data can be applied as constraints in seismotectonic zonation (Zoback 1993).|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{disturbances}} that a <b>potentially</b> <b>active</b> <b>fault</b> {{receives from}} a slip on a neighboring fault {{might be considered}} as nature's mechanical stability. The problem of static and dynamic stress fields induced by faulting is analysed {{as a way to}} estimate the stability of nearby active faults. The source fault is modelled by a Volterra dislocation of a strike-slip type along a vertical surface embedded in an elastic homogeneous infinite medium for both dynamic and static models. In order to represent quantitatively a resultant effect of stress caused by the source fault, a new scalar quantity is introduced in reference to the results of laboratory studies on fault friction. This quantity, which is called the resultant stress, is the linear combination of shear and normal components of the induced stress vector acting on the potential fault which is assumed to be parallel to the source fault. The spatial distribution of the static resultant stress in the seismogenic layer, which was calculated in the semiinfinite medium, indicates four regions around the source where the resultant stress takes positive values. These regions extend from the fault surface and in the direction close to the strike of the fault. The probability of further fracture in these regions increases as a result of stress redistribution in the medium due to faulting. The dominant characteristics of the dynamic stress field is the strong directivity effect, which is especially apparent {{in the case of a}} unilateral rupture. The correlation between the static and the dynamic field is also notable. The maximum values of the dynamic resultant stress are of the order of 10 bars at distances comparable to fault dimensions, if we assume a fault model which is equivalent to a M 7. 0 earthquake. The ratio of maximum dynamic stress to the corresponding static stress takes the values ranging from a few to 50 bars or more, depending on the location of an observer and the character of rupture propagation. This means that if a <b>potentially</b> <b>active</b> <b>fault</b> is located in the vicinity of a seismic source, then it could be loaded with high dynamic stress whose peak value would be equivalent to tens of years of stress accumulation at a normal tectonic rate. Such interpretation, however, must be checked carefully with respect to the time-dependence effect of applied stress on material strength...|$|E
40|$|The field {{investigations}} in the epicentral {{area of the}} 1994 Wadakkancheri (Desamangalam), Kerala, earthquake (M 4. 3) indicate subtle, but clearly recognizable expressions of geologically recent fault zone, consisting of fracture sets showing brittle displacement and a gouge zone. The fracture zone confines to the crystalline basement, and is spatially coincident with the elongation of the isoseismals of the 1994 mainshock and a 10 -km-long WNW-ESE trending topographic lineament. The preliminary results from the electron spin resonance (ESR) dating on the quartz grains from the fault gouge indicate that the last major faulting in this site occurred 430 +/- 43 ka ago. The experiments on different grain sizes of quartz from the gouge showed consistent decrease in age to a plateau of low values, indicating that ESR signals in finer grains were completely zeroed {{at the time of}} faulting due to frictional heat. The results show a relatively young age for displacement on the fault that occurs within a Precambrian shear zone. Discrete reactivated faults in such areas may be characterized by low degree of activity, but considering the ESR age of the last significant faulting event, the structure at Desamangalam may be categorized as a <b>potentially</b> <b>active</b> <b>fault</b> capable of generating moderate earthquakes, separated by very long periods of quiescence...|$|E
40|$|The role of upper-crustal {{faulting}} {{in building}} {{and maintaining the}} extreme relief of the Longmen Shan region at the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau has been strongly debated. The Mw 7. 9 Wenchuan earthquake of 12 May 2008 ruptured three distinct faults along the plateau margin and thus provides a unique insight into the mechanisms and kinematics of regional crustal deformation. Two of the faults, the northeast-striking Beichuan and Pengguan faults, had been previously recognized as active, with past surface-rupturing earthquakes in the latest Pleistocene to Holocene time. Some of the late Quaternary fault segments were activated in the Wenchuan earthquake, but others, including several with clear evidence of Holocene strike-slip displacement, were not. Instead, in almost all cases, the Wenchuan surface rupture followed geological faults mapped {{on the basis of}} bedrock lithology. We infer that active deformation along the plateau margin is accommodated by partial reactivation of a complex network of preexisting faults but that a single through-going structure has not been established—and may never be if the total deformation is strongly rotational and three-dimensional. The earthquake also illustrates that the Beichuan and Pengguan faults are kinematically linked, in part by the northwest-striking Xiaoyudong fault, and that both must be strongly listric in the upper few km of the crust. The complexity of the active (or <b>potentially</b> <b>active)</b> <b>fault</b> network in the Longmen Shan, coupled with rapid postearthquake modification of the surface rupture trace, poses serious difficulties for seismic hazard assessment across the region. ...|$|E

It was part of a seismic crisis with 37 events of magnitude (Mw) ranging from 3. 7 to 5. 5., from early 2001 to late 2004 and centered about 80 km north of Dodoma. This paper re-evaluates the active tectonic setting of the Dodoma area, using combined integration of existing geological and topographic maps with the recently released SRTM DEM with a GIS. Main emphasis is put on morphotectonic analysis of <b>potentially</b> <b>active</b> <b>fault</b> scarps using topographic elevation data extracted from the SRTM DEM. The ongoing study has revealed that the Mponde and Bubu faults are seemingly the active faults or most likely so as compared to other faults in the Dodoma area. The Saranda and the Bubu faults have three fault segments each. For the Saranda fault, the fault segments are here-by called Saranda south (> 11 km), Saranda mid (29 km) and Saranda north (24 km). The Gonga (42 km), Makutupora (30 km) and Nkambala (33 km) are fault segments which form the Bubu fault. Similarly, the Hombolo fault has two fault segments namely the DAM fault segment (18 km) and the Nzuguni fault segment (> 19 km) with total length of the order of 40 km. Similar investigations on the Furu fault are underway.

In order to assess the seismic hazard for the Alps - Ligurian basin junction, we investigated this area to provide a record of earthquakes that have recently occurred {{near the city of}} Nice. Although no historical seismicity has been indicated for the lower Var valley, our main objective was to identify traces of recent faulting and to discuss the seismogenic potential of any active faults. We organized multidisciplinary observations as a microseismic investigation (the PASIS survey), with morphotectonic mapping and imagery, and subsurface geophysical investigations. The results of the PASIS dense recording survey were disappointing, as no present-day intense microseismic activity was recorded. From the morphotectonic investigation of the lower Var valley, we revealed several morphological anomalies, such as drainage perturbations and extended linear anomalies that are unrelated to the lithology. These anomalies strike mainly NE-SW, with the major Saint-Sauveur - Donareo lineament, clearly related to faulting of the Plio-Pleistocene sedimentary series. Sub-surface geophysical investigation (electrical resistivity tomography profiling) imaged these faults in the shallow crust, and together with the microtectonic data, allow us to propose the timing of recent faulting in this area. Normal and left-lateral strike-slip faulting occurred several times during the Pliocene. From fault-slip data, the last episode of faulting was left-lateral strike-slip and was related to a NNW-SSE direction of compression. This direction of compression is consistent with the present-day state of stress and the Saint-Sauveur-Donareo fault might have been reactivated several times as a left-lateral fault during the Quaternary. At a regional scale, in the Nice fold-and-thrust belt, these data lead to a reappraisal of the NE-SW structural trends as the major <b>potentially</b> <b>active</b> <b>fault</b> system. We propose that the Saint-Sauveur-Donareo fault belongs to a larger system of faults that runs from near Villeneuve-Loubet to the southwest to the Vésubie valley to the north-east. The question of a structural connection between the Vésubie - Mt Férion fault, the Saint-Sauveur-Donareo fault and its possible extension offshore through the northern Ligurian margin is discussed. The Saint-Sauveur-Donareo fault shows two en-échelon segments that extend for about 8 km. Taking into account the regional seismogenic depth (about 10 km), this fault could produce M ~ 6 earthquakes if activated entirely during one event. Although a moderate magnitude generally yields a moderate seismic hazard, we suggest that this contribution to the local seismic risk is high, taking into account the possible shallow focal depth and the high vulnerability of Nice and the surrounding urban areas...|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 I have {{identified}} evidence for <b>potentially</b> <b>active</b> northeast-striking <b>faults</b> {{in the greater}} Fairbanks area and have developed a model for their evolution that defines the character of faults and timing of structural events. Seismicity, topographic data, and geological and geophysical maps show that <b>potentially</b> <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> correspond with previously mapped bedrock faults, topographic lows, and magnetic anomalies. Seismicity indicates that faults in Interior Alaska have low to moderate tectonic activity; geomorphic and structural analyses of mapped faults indicate they are dominantly left-lateral strike-slip, but have smaller normal or reverse components. The normal component of slip increases to the west toward the Nenana basin based on tilted fault block geometries observed in seismicity. Deformed Pliocene to Quaternary strata, placer deposits presumably related to tectonic-induced stream capture events, and geomorphic anomalies such as valley and basin asymmetry, barbed drainages, and changes in river morphology all suggest Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic activity along northeast-striking left-lateral faults. Northeast-striking faults {{have been at least}} episodically active since the late Cretaceous. Northeast-striking fault-hosted gold deposits related to ~ 90 Ma intrusions suggest that fault parallel extension fractures or tension veins formed at ~ 90 Ma during a period of northwest-southeast extension. Thermochronological data are consistent with exhumation at ~ 56 - 42 Ma, possibly resulting from dextral shearing between the Denali and Tintina faults. Northeast-striking faults were reactivated as normal faults along pre-existing extensional trends. Thermochronological data suggest that strike-slip displacement on the Tintina fault significantly decreased at ~ 42 Ma. However, dip-slip motion continued along northeast-striking faults after 42 Ma as a result of contraction related to northward plate convergence. Drainage restorations, high-levels of background seismicity, and focal mechanisms support the hypothesis that at ~ 6 Ma, significant left-lateral motion occurred along northeast-striking faults and has continued to the present...|$|R

Sensitivity tests show that the uncertainty on the slip rate of the Rhine River fault is the dominant factor controlling the variability of the seismic hazard level, greater than the epistemic uncertainty due to ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs). Uncertainty on slip rate estimates from 0. 04 to 0. 1  mm yr − 1 results in a 40 to 50...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (US DOE), {{under the}} auspices of the International Nuclear Safety Program (INSP) is {{supporting}} in-depth safety assessments (ISA) of nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union for the purpose of evaluating the safety and upgrades necessary to the stock of nuclear power plants in Ukraine. For this purpose the Hazards Mitigation Center at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has been asked to assess the seismic hazard and design parameters at the sites of the nuclear power plants in Ukraine. The probabilistic seismic hazard (PSH) estimates were updated using the latest available data and knowledge from LLNL, the U. S. Geological Survey, and other relevant recent studies from several consulting companies. Special attention was given to account for the local seismicity, the deep focused earthquakes of the Vrancea zone, in Romania, the region around Crimea and for the system of <b>potentially</b> <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> associated with the Pripyat Dniepro Donnetts rift. Aleatory (random) uncertainty was estimated from the available data and the epistemic (knowledge) uncertainty was estimated by considering the existing models in the literature and the interpretations of a small group of experts elicited during a workshop conducted in Kiev, Ukraine, on February 2 - 4, 1999...|$|R
40|$|Many {{areas of}} the Earth’s crust deform by {{distributed}} extensional faulting and complex fault interactions are often observed. Geodetic data generally indicate a simpler picture of continuum deformation over decades but relating this behaviour to earthquake occurrence over centuries, given numerous <b>potentially</b> <b>active</b> <b>faults,</b> remains a global problem in hazard assessment. We address this challenge for an array of seismogenic aults in the central Italian Apennines, where crustal extension and devastating earthquakes occur in response to regional surface uplift. We constrain fault slip-rates since ~ 18 ka using variations in cosmogenic 36 Cl measured on bedrock scarps, mapped using LiDAR and ground penetrating radar, and compare these rates to those inferred from geodesy. The 36 Cl data reveal that individual faults typically accumulate meters of displacement relatively rapidly over several thousand years, separated by similar length time intervals when slip-rates are much lower, and activity shifts between faults across strike. Our rates agree with continuum deformation rates when averaged over long spatial or temporal scales (104 yr; 102 km) but over shorter timescales most of the deformation may be accommodated by < 30 % of the across-strike fault array. We attribute the shifts in activity to temporal variations in the mechanical work of faulting...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the nature}} of {{earthquake}} ground motions that can be expected in San Diego's foreseeable future? Although this is the most basic of questions underlying the adequate design of structures to resist earthquakes, answers to this question are disturbingly uncertain. A reasonable assumption is that future earthquake ground motions will be similar to those that have occurred in the past. When compared with San Francisco or Los Angeles, San Diego has historically experienced relatively mild earthquake shaking. Unfortunately, San Diego's written history is very short compared to the time scales of earthquake repetition. Are there sources of earthquakes that may cause damage in San Diego and what is their frequency? Mapping of geologic structures and the study of patterns of small earthquakes are the primary tools for recognizing <b>potentially</b> <b>active</b> <b>faults.</b> There are features in both the geologic structure and the seismicity that are suggestive of major <b>active</b> <b>faults</b> that could pose a serious hazard to San Diego. Furthermore, there is evidence that the rate of occurrence of small earthquakes has increased within the last 5 years when compared with the previous 50 years. However, these features are not well studied or understood. Even if the potential sources of earthquakes were well understood, the problem of anticipating the range of future ground motions is difficult. The nature of shaking from earthquakes is strongly affected by the nature of seismic wave propagation through complex geologic structures (path effects). Although path effects are likely to be of great importance in San Diego, relatively little specific information is available...|$|R
