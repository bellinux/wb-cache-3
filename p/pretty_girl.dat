500|$|DeBeck kept readers on {{the edges}} of their seats with {{uncertain}} suspense: sometimes Spark Plug actually won a race. [...] While DeBeck resisted at first, Hearst demanded a <b>pretty</b> <b>girl</b> be introduced into the strip. [...] DeBeck brought in Sweet Mama, which initially created a stir, and certain papers dropped the strip, but after the phrase swept the nation, the strip's popularity only increased. [...] Over the years, DeBeck was credited with introducing more neologisms and catchphrases, such as [...] "heebie-jeebies", [...] "", [...] "balls of fire" [...] and [...] "time's a-wastin'". [...] In 1923, Billy Rose penned a Tin Pan Alley pop hit called [...] "Barney Google (with the Goo-Goo-Googly Eyes)". [...] A series of Barney Google live-action films starring Barney Hellum appeared in 1928 and 1929.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{has some}} accuracies, The Great Ziegfeld takes many key liberties with Ziegfeld's life {{and the history of}} the Follies, {{resulting}} in many inaccuracies. The earlier scenes with Sandow, the milk bath advertising scenario, and many other sequences including several of the dramatic {{ups and downs of the}} film were fictional. George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue was never featured in the Follies, and the number [...] "A <b>Pretty</b> <b>Girl</b> Is Like a Melody" [...] was written for the 1919 Follies, not the first edition of the revue, as shown in the film. Ray Bolger was never cast in a [...] "Follies" [...] show, and although she was born in the U.S, Billie Burke grew up in England and spoke with a Mid-Atlantic accent throughout her life; Loy who portrays her clearly has an American accent in the film.|$|E
500|$|The curtains, made of rayon silk, {{measured}} [...] Sheldon Hall and Stephen Neale {{note the}} theatrical {{sense that the}} cinematographers achieved through shooting the sequence in virtually a single take. They mention that [...] "the camera traverses an enormous platform set contained within a curtained proscenium (also enormous)", and that the [...] "set itself revolves to meet the camera, rather than the camera entering {{the space of the}} set." [...] Linda Mizejewski, author of a book on the Ziegfeld girls, argues that the <b>Pretty</b> <b>Girl</b> sequence is more than just about being showy; it is symbolic of womanhood which [...] "powerfully visualizes women as the raw material for male aesthetic vision and design". In the film she believes that womanhood is defined by the [...] "young, white, blond and slender" [...] female, which in the sequence are [...] "delineated as the fluffy, artificial tiers of costuming and staging".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{marks the}} debut {{appearance}} of Lurleen on The Simpsons. She {{was created by}} one of the show's character designers, John Rice. Kirkland thought the first design Rice drew of Lurleen was too [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "plain", so they decided to model her after D'Angelo and add [...] "every kind of <b>pretty</b> <b>girl</b> cliché" [...] into the design. Rice and Kirkland then sent the character to Groening, who sent back a note saying [...] "wow". Reiss's show runner partner Al Jean said that [...] "one of the most difficult things when translating real people to a Simpsons look is for women to look beautiful", as the Simpson overbite and facial construction make it particularly difficult to design women's looks. Lurleen's last name, Lumpkin, came from the country bumpkin character Tony Lumpkin in the 1773 comedy play She Stoops to Conquer by Oliver Goldsmith.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Adam Mitchell was first conceived, along with Henry van Statten, during Russell T Davies' 2003 pitch to the BBC, {{in a story}} heavily based on Robert Shearman's audio play Jubilee, which would later form the base for the episode [...] "Dalek". It was always {{the intention of the}} production team for Adam to join the TARDIS after Rose developed a liking for him. To play this role Langley was chosen, mostly because of his role on Coronation Street as Todd Grimshaw. He had auditioned for the role on the same day as doing publicity for his leaving storyline in Coronation Street. Reacting to his casting Langley, remarked that [...] "I couldn't have asked for a better next role because Doctor Who is another great institution." [...] Langley describes Adam as [...] "a bit nerdy" [...] and states of his character's attraction to Rose that [...] "she's a very <b>pretty</b> <b>girl</b> and Adam hasn't seen any girls for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Johar first wrote a story, {{which was}} a love {{triangle}} between a tomboy, a very <b>pretty</b> <b>girl</b> and a slightly insensitive boy, but he shelved the idea {{because he was not}} very satisfied with it. Then he wrote another plot about a widower and his child, which he shelved as well. Eventually he decided to merge the two stories into one. He explained in an interview with Rediff.com: [...] "It was about the trauma of a widower and his little child. How the child really wants a mother and how she brings her mother into her father's life. Then I thought: Why not bring a youth aspect to the story? Why not a flashback? That's how the story got made." [...] The story also includes a [...] "personal desires vs. parental loyalties" [...] theme, and has some [...] "East meets West" [...] themes, but instead of the characters going abroad, it creates a virtual West inside India.|$|E
