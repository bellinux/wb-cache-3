40|$|Power-efficient <b>pre-equalisation</b> {{techniques}} for subband adaptive OFDM transmissions are proposed {{as an effective}} means of improving the overall system performance in fading time-dispersive channels. The effects of the time-variant channel are examined and it is shown that adaptive modulation techniques are well suited to <b>pre-equalisation.</b> A range of different throughput and different target bit error rate (BER) systems are designed, which exhibit different amplifier back-off requirements. For example, the 10 %, 1 % and 0. 01 % target BER candidate systems exhibit bits per symbol (BPS) throughputs of about 2, 3 and 3. 8 around the channel SNR of 15 dB over the investigated 155 Mbps, 60 GHz propagation frequency wideband Wireless Asynchronous Transfer Mode (WATM) channel...|$|E
40|$|This {{communication}} {{deals with}} space-time <b>pre-equalisation</b> for UMTS-TDD systems. The motivation for that {{lies in the}} fact that the up and downlink channels are highly correlated, and thus the equalisation functions can be moved to the BS, therefore simplifying the receiver design. A design technique that explores the frequency redundancy of DS-SS signals is derived for a zero-forcing (ZF) multiple access interference (MAI) criterion. Preliminary examples show that significant improvements can be obtained in MAI dominating scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Compound {{precoding}} is {{a state-of-the-art}} technique for combining trellis coding and decision-feedback equalisation (DFE) prior to upstream transmission on the telephone-line channel, {{and is an}} option in the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) -T V. 92 standard. In this paper, we provide a detailed overview of this technique. We demonstrate that compound precoding combines in a straightforward manner with most practical trellis codes. We show that compound precoding exhibits a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain with respect to other schemes which combine with trellis coding, and quantify this gain. We also show that, for stability of the compound precoder, the precoder feedforward filter must be decomposed into its constituent minimum phase (MP) and all pass (AP) components. Finally, a simulation study of V. 92 upstream transmission demonstrates the shaping advantage of compound precoding over competitor techniques for <b>pre-equalisation</b> in this setting. ...|$|E
