25|$|Zygomycosis is the {{broadest}} term {{to refer to}} infections caused by bread mold fungi of the zygomycota phylum. However, because zygomycota {{has been identified as}} polyphyletic, and is not included in modern fungal classification systems, the diseases that zygomycosis can refer to are better called by their specific names: mucormycosis (after Mucorales), phycomycosis (after <b>Phycomycetes)</b> and basidiobolomycosis (after Basidiobolus). These rare yet serious and potentially life-threatening fungal infections usually affect the face or oropharyngeal (nose and mouth) cavity. Zygomycosis type infections are most often caused by common fungi found in soil and decaying vegetation. While most individuals are exposed to the fungi on a regular basis, those with immune disorders (immunocompromised) are more prone to fungal infection. These types of infections are also common after natural disasters, such as tornadoes or earthquakes, where people have open wounds that have become filled with soil or vegetative matter.|$|E

40|$|During the yeast-to-hyphae {{transition}} of the dimorphic <b>phycomycete</b> Mucor racemosus, {{there was a}} 30 - to 50 -fold increase in the activity of ornithine decarboxylase. Increased enzyme activity preceded the emergence of germ tubes and reached a maximum before conversion was completed. Subsequently, enzyme levels rapidly declined, despite the continuation of mycelial growth. Both putrescine and spermidine blocked the enzyme activity response. Protein synthesis was required for the increase in enzyme activity during morphogenesis. A combination of actinomycin D and netropsin inhibited ribonucleic acid synthesis but failed to inhibit the increase in ornithine decarboxylase activity.

In an enriched peptone medium containing glucose, neither activity was detected until glucose was exhausted from the medium. Treatment of acetate-grown cells with glucose resulted in a rapid decline in the specific activities of both enzymes. The importance of this cycle in acetate-grown cells was indicated by the ability of itaconic acid (100 mM) to inhibit the growth of M. racemosus in acetate but not glutamate media.

40|$|Mucormycosis is {{a fungus}} {{infection}} which {{in most instances}} occurs as a complication in severely ill patients (1). Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is often the underlying disease. The isolation of the <b>phycomycete</b> Rkizo ~ oryzaz (2) and the reproduction of the disease in experimental animals have been previously reported (3).

Fungus lesions of intermediate severity are encountered in rabbits with sustained infusion hyperglycemia without diabetes (4). In both experiments, the polymorphonuclear leukocytes uniformly reveal degenerative changes consisting of nuclear pyknosis and karyorrhexis which suggest impaired leukocytic function.
