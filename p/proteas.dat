5|$|The major {{international}} tournament in Africa is organised by the Confederation of Southern African Netball Associations, which invites teams from Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Malawi, South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe and the Seychelles to take part. The tournament is hosted by a country within the region; senior and under 21 teams compete. The tournament {{has served as}} a qualifier for the World Championships. South Africa launched a new domestic competition in 2011 called Netball Grand Series. It features eight regional teams from South Africa and is aimed at increasing the amount of playing time for players. It runs for 17 weeks and replaces the National Netball League, which was played over only two weeks. According to <b>Proteas</b> captain Elsje Jordaan, it was hoped that the competition would create an opportunity for players to become professional.|$|E

The last eight series that Kallis played in for South Africa were all {{victories}} for the <b>Proteas,</b> {{with the exception}} of one series draw against Pakistan in the UAE. Kallis became one of the few players in world cricket to have one two series each in England and Australia (his 182 not out at The Oval, and his 147 at The Gabba in Brisbane contributed richly to his team's successes). The <b>Proteas</b> also won two series against New Zealand and one against each of India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, England and Australia.|$|E
25|$|The Springbok {{nickname}} and logo also {{dates from}} the 1906–7 tour of Britain. The springbok was chosen to represent the team by tour captain Paul Roos {{in an attempt to}} prevent the British press from inventing their own name. The logo was not restricted to the white team alone – the first coloured national team used the springbok in 1939 and the first black team in 1950. After the fall of apartheid in 1992 a wreath of <b>proteas</b> was added to the logo. When the ANC was elected in 1994 the team's name was not changed to the <b>Proteas,</b> like that of other South African sporting teams, only because of the intervention of President Nelson Mandela.|$|E

40|$|Phyllachora <b>proteae</b> is a {{well known}} leaf {{pathogen}} of <b>Protea</b> spp. In the present study this fungus was recollected from several genera and species of Proteaceae in the Western Cape province of South Africa, and its taxonomy was reassessed.

40|$|This paper {{represents}} {{the first of}} a series dealing with fungi associated with Proteaceae cultivated in Australia. Several leaf pathogens are newly recorded, including Botryosphaeria <b>proteae,</b> Coleroa senniana, Kabatiella <b>proteae,</b> Mycosphaerella jonkershoekensis and Mycosphaerella lateralis from <b>Protea</b> spp. The host range of Phyllosticta telopea is expanded to also include Grevillea, Leucadendron and Leucospermum, and a Pestalotiopsis leaf spot known previously from Africa only is also reported on <b>Protea</b> and Telopea.

40|$|Species of Leucadendron, Leucospermum and <b>Protea</b> (Proteaceae) are in {{high demand}} for the {{international}} floriculture market due to their brightly coloured and textured flowers or bracts. Fungal pathogens, however, create a serious problem in cultivating flawless blooms. The aim {{of the present study}} was to characterise several of these pathogens using morphology, culture characteristics, and DNA sequence data of the rRNA-ITS and LSU genes. In some cases additional genes such as TEF 1 -a and CHS were also sequenced. Based on the results of this study, several novel species and genera are described. Brunneosphaerella leaf blight is shown to be caused by three species, namely B. jonkershoekensis on <b>Protea</b> repens, B. nitidae sp. nov. on <b>Protea</b> nitida and B. protearum on a wide host range of <b>Protea</b> spp. (South Africa). Coniothyrium-like species associated with Coniothyrium leaf spot are allocated to other genera, namely Curreya grandicipis on <b>Protea</b> grandiceps, and Microsphaeropsis <b>proteae</b> on P. nitida (South Africa). Diaporthe leucospermi is described on Leucospermum sp. (Australia), and Diplodina microsperma newly reported on <b>Protea</b> sp. (New Zealand). Pyrenophora blight is caused by a novel species, Pyrenophora leucospermi, and not Drechslera biseptata or D. dematoidea as previously reported. Fusicladium <b>proteae</b> is described on <b>Protea</b> sp. (South Africa), Pestalotiopsis protearum on Leucospermum cuneiforme (Zimbabwe), Ramularia vizellae and R. stellenboschensis on <b>Protea</b> spp. (South Africa), and Teratosphaeria capensis on <b>Protea</b> spp. (Portugal, South Africa). Aureobasidium leaf spot is shown to be caused by two species, namelyA. proteaecomb. nov. on <b>Protea</b> spp. (South Africa), and A. leucospermi sp. nov. on Leucospermum spp. (Indonesia, Portugal, South Africa). Novel genera and species elucidated in this study include Gordonomyces mucovaginatus and Pseudopassalora gouriqua (hyphomycetes), and Xenoconiothyrium catenata (coelomycete), all on <b>Protea</b> spp. (South Africa) ...|$|R
25|$|Following his {{successful}} tour of Pakistan, Kallis smashed two aggressive centuries in matches against New Zealand at Johannesburg's Wanderer's Stadium and Centurion Park in Pretoria, thus taking his total century count to five in four matches. Following this purple patch of form, Kallis endured three tours without {{success in the}} form of hundreds, although the <b>Proteas</b> secured historic series victories in England and Australia, and won a two-match series against Bangladesh at home in between.|$|E
25|$|On 20 December 2013, Philander {{took his}} 100th test wicket {{in the first}} test against India in Johannesburg. He needed only 19 matches to reach his 100 wickets, the joint-sixth fastest ever. Earlier the same day he scored an anchor-innings of 59 runs (from 86 balls), batting at number 8, showing off his {{versatility}} for the <b>Proteas.</b> These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowling Rankings for the year 2013.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} against <b>Proteas,</b> rain {{interrupted}} in numerous occasions, which gave only 7 over per side match. South Africa batted first and AB de Villiers smashed 30 runs from 13 balls, where they finished with 78/4 in 7 overs. Sri Lanka {{was not good}} at all, only scored 46/5, no any batsmen scored more than 15 runs. South Africa won the match by 32 runs, which is a huge margin in T20s. However, both team qualified for the Super 8s.|$|E

25|$|Another South African {{was charged}} with alleged ball {{tampering}} on 18 November 2016 after their victory in the second Test against Australia in Hobart. <b>Proteas</b> skipper Faf du Plessis was alleged to have tampered with {{the condition of the}} ball after TV footage appeared to show him applying saliva onto the ball from a mint or a lollipop.

25|$|England then won {{a thrilling}} match against South Africa on 6 March, bowling their opponents out for 165 in Chennai {{to defend a}} low score of 171, with Stuart Broad {{claiming}} 4 vital wickets. The English bowlers derailed the strong <b>Proteas</b> batting lineup, which collapsed from 63 for no loss and lost all their wickets for 102 runs. However, the group stage ended in another shock defeat, this time to Bangladesh, and although England qualified for the quarter-finals, they were comprehensively beaten by Sri Lanka.
