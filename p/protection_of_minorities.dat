5|$|The Minority Treaties, {{recognized}} as history's first minority treaties, were {{an important step}} in <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> and recognition of human rights, bringing the subject to an international forum. In them, for the first time, states and international communities recognized that there are people living outside normal legal protection and who required an additional guarantee of their elementary rights from an external body, as protection within individual states itself may not be sufficient. Among issues successfully resolved by the Minority Treaties was the Åland crisis.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stages of the British raj, the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India {{proposed}} a Constituent Assembly to draft a Constitution for India as {{part of the process of}} transfer of power. The Constituent Assembly of India, composed of indirectly elected representatives from the British provinces and Princely states, commenced its proceedings in December 1946, and completed drafting the Constitution of India by November 1949. According to the Cabinet Mission plan, the Assembly was to have an Advisory Committee to advise it on the nature and extent of fundamental rights, <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> and administration of tribal areas. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee was constituted in January 1947 with 64 members, and from among these a twelve-member sub-committee on Fundamental Rights was appointed under the chairmanship of J.B. Kripalani in February 1947. The sub-committee drafted the Fundamental Rights and submitted its report to the Committee by April 1947, and later that month the Committee placed it before the Assembly, which debated and discussed the rights over the course of the following year, adopting the drafts of most of them by, December 1948. The drafting of the Fundamental Rights was influenced by the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the U.N. General Assembly and the activities of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in interpreting the Bill of Rights in the American Constitution. The Directive Principles, which were also drafted by the sub-committee on Fundamental Rights, expounded the socialist precepts of the Indian independence movement, and were inspired by similar principles contained in the Irish Constitution. The Fundamental Duties were later added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{advocated}} quick {{recognition of}} Croatia, stating that {{it wanted to}} stop ongoing violence in Serb-inhabited areas. It was opposed by France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, but the countries agreed to pursue a common approach and avoid unilateral actions. On 10 October, {{two days after the}} Croatian Parliament confirmed the declaration of independence, the EEC decided to postpone any decision to recognize Croatia for two months, deciding to recognize Croatian independence in two months if the war had not ended by then. As the deadline expired, Germany presented its decision to recognize Croatia as its policy and dutya position supported by Italy and Denmark. France and the UK attempted to prevent the recognition by drafting a United Nations resolution requesting no unilateral actions which could worsen the situation, but backed down during the Security Council debate on 14 December, when Germany appeared determined to defy the UN resolution. On 17 December, the EEC formally agreed to grant Croatia diplomatic recognition on 15 January 1992, relying on opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee. The Committee ruled that Croatia's independence should not be recognized immediately, because the new Croatian Constitution did not provide <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> required by the EEC. In response, the President Franjo Tuđman gave written assurances to Robert Badinter that the deficit would be remedied. The RSK formally declared its separation from Croatia on 19 December, but its statehood and independence were not recognized internationally. On 26 December, Yugoslav authorities announced plans for a smaller state, which could include the territory captured from Croatia, but the plan was rejected by the UN General Assembly.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{features}} of takeover law is the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> shareholders. This article examines the extent at which the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> shareholders is an objective of EU law, comparing certain provisions in the Takeover Directive with their equivalent in English law. The arguments advanced in this article are threefold. First, English law offers better protection to minority shareholders than accorded under EU law. Second, that the protection accorded to minority shareholders under EU law is only incidental to the objective of facilitating the restructuring of companies. Third, that in seeking to achieve a restructuring of companies objective, both EU law and English law on takeovers trumps property rights <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> shareholders. The article draws a conclusion that the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> shareholder in takeovers is about market fairness and not legal rights...|$|R

25|$|Also {{at about}} this time, the {{attention}} of the world community (as manifested in the UN) began to focus on the same theme, similarly re-calibrating its concern for minorities into concern for the rights of indigenous peoples. In 1982 the Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (then called Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Minorities)</b> was established by a decision of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and in 1985 work began on drafting a declaration of rights (a process which lasted 22 years). In due course, 1993 was proclaimed the International Year of the World's Indigenous People. The following year, the United Nations General Assembly launched the International Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples (1995–2004) and then, on September 13, 2007, it adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.|$|E

40|$|The <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> {{languages}} has international, {{national and}} sub-national dimensions in {{that human rights}} protection entails the adoption and implementation of international norms within the domestic legal space. While the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> language rights is ultimately the responsibility of sovereign state institutions, the internationalization of rights exerts global pressure on national governments to accept universal standards as a political imperative. This paper investigates the current legal framework for minority language protection in Japan, where discrimination against minority groups has been deeply entrenched. The Japanese position is contextualized within a broader discussion <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> language <b>protection</b> at global and European level to investigate the political environment in which a significant shift in policy has begun for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> language rights. By shifting our gaze from historical changes in Japanese policies to recent patterns of policy reform, attention is focussed on the pressures that contribute to reshaping policies at the domestic level...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{proposed}} that corporate governance has {{a positive effect on}} anti-corruption. The paper further investigates the effects of corporate governance on the corruption-economic growth relationship at the national level. Three major corporate governance mechanisms are discussed: efficacy of corporate boards, strength of auditing and financial reporting standards, and <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> shareholders’ interests. Using a balanced panel data set of 55 countries (26 developed countries and 29 emerging countries) between 2003 and 2011, the results show that corporate governance weakens the relationship between corruption and economic growth. More specifically, for developed countries, the efficacy of corporate boards, strength of auditing and financial reporting standards, and the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> shareholder’s interest help mitigate the negative impacts of corruption on economic growth. For emerging countries, strength of auditing and financial reporting standards and the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> shareholder’s interest help mitigate the positive impacts of corruption on economic growth...|$|R

Khoury asserts that al-Kharrat was [...] "probably the most respected and esteemed qabaday of his day". Qabadayat normally shunned formal education, and historian Michael Provence maintains that al-Kharrat was likely illiterate. Qabadayat were normally linked with particular city notables and could secure them political support in their neighborhoods. Al-Kharrat was allied with Nasib al-Bakri, a Damascene politician and landowner. The al-Bakri family was the most influential in al-Shaghour, and al-Kharrat served as the family's principal connection and enforcer in the quarter.|$|E
