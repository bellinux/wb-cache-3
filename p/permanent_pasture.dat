5|$|Under the British National Vegetation Classification (NVC) Whitton Bridge Pasture is {{considered}} as mesotrophic grassland because it represents well-drained and <b>permanent</b> <b>pasture.</b> In particular it {{is considered}} to be an MG5 community because of the species present. MG5 is widespread in many lowland areas in England, Wales, and Scotland, particularly in the Midlands. Whitton Bridge Pasture is predominantly subcommunity MG5c (Danthonia decumbens), however subcommunity MG5a (Lathyrus pratensis) is present with a substantially different species composition.|$|E

25|$|Woolbury, or Woolbury Ring, is {{the site}} of an Iron Age univallate hill fort on Stockbridge Down, Hampshire, England.

The bank and ditch are well preserved to the west, the bank being 9ft. high and 16ft. above the bottom of the ditch. The eastern side has been ploughed out, and the ditch only remains to the north and south.

2500|$|High {{levels of}} {{fertilizers}} entering waterways are a pertinent environmental concern associated with agricultural systems. [...] However, management intensive rotational grazing systems effectively {{reduce the amount}} of nutrients that move off-farm which have the potential to cause environmental degradation. [...] These systems are fertilized with on-farm sources, and are less prone to leaching as compared to commercial fertilizers. [...] Additionally, the system is less prone to excess nutrient fertilization, so the majority of nutrients put into the system by manure sources are utilized for plant growth. [...] <b>Permanent</b> <b>pasture</b> systems also have deeper, well established forage root systems which are more efficient at taking up nutrients from within the soil profile.|$|E

Norfolk Island has no direct control over any marine areas but has an agreement with the Commonwealth through the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) to fish [...] "recreationally" [...] in a small section of the EEZ known locally as [...] "the Box".
