40|$|Abstract. A CV joint {{outer race}} is an {{important}} load-supporting part in cars. Its geometry is very complicated. Traditional hot and cold forging methods have their own limitations to produce such a complex shaped part. Therefore, multistage forging may be advantageous to produce this part. The key point of outer race is performing the geometry of ball grooves with negative slope angle. Traditional methods form the ball groove by machining that takes long time and waste many portions of the material. Thus near net shape forging is an attractive option for producing of outer race. In this study, the process sequence in the multistage forging of a CV joint outer race has been investigated by using the rigid plastic finite volume method and forging process sequence is designed which can produce a near net-shape housing without defects within a given <b>press</b> <b>capacity.</b> Finally physical modelling with commercial lead is used to verify the reliability of numerical simulation results...|$|E

Extrusion load is found to increase with increase in extrusion speed. The die pockets help in reducing the extrusion load. The effective strain, which provides the information about the work hardening of the material during the extrusion process is dependentof the above said process parameters.

The 17 - to 26 -year-olds were randomly assigned, in a doubleblind fashion, to either a creatine treatment group (CT) (n= 10) or placebo control group (PC) (n= 10). During the phase, the CT group ingested 5 g of creatine monohydrate 4 times each day. The PC group followed the same administration schedule but consumed a glucose placebo.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the output {{properties}} of muscle power by the dominant upper limb using SSC, and the relationships between the power output by SSC and a one-repetition maximum bench press (1 RM BP) used as a strength indicator of the upper body. Sixteen male athletes (21. 4 ± 0. 9 yr) participated in this study. They pulled a load of 40 % of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) at a stretch by elbow flexion of the dominant upper limb in the following three preliminary conditions: static relaxed muscle state (SR condition), isometric muscle contraction state (ISO condition), and using SSC (SSC condition). The velocity with a wire load via a pulley during elbow flexion was measured accurately using a power instrument with a rotary encoder, and the muscle power curve was drawn from the product of the velocity and load. Significant differences were found among all evaluation parameters of muscle power exerted from the above three conditions and the parameters regarding early power output during concentric contraction were larger in the SSC condition than the SR and ISO conditions. The parameters on initial muscle contraction velocity when only using SSC significantly correlated with 1 RM BP (r= 0. 60 - 0. 62). The use of SSC before powerful elbow flexion may contribute largely to early explosive power output during concentric contraction. Bench <b>press</b> <b>capacity</b> relates to a development of the above early power output when using SSC...|$|E
40|$|High {{strength}} steels enable new {{solutions for}} weight optimized car bodies without sacrificing crash safety. However, cold forming of these steels is limited {{due to the}} need of high <b>press</b> <b>capacity,</b> increased tool wear, and limitations in possible geometries. One can compensate for these drawbacks by local heat treatment of the blanks. In high-deformation areas {{the strength of the}} material is reduced and the plasticity is increased by diode laser irradiation. Local heat treatment with diode laser radiation could also yield key benefits for the applicability of press hardened parts. High strength is not desired all over the part. Joint areas or deformation zones for requested crash properties require locally reduced strength. In the research project "LOKWAB" funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), heat treatment of high strength steels was investigated in cooperation with Audi, BMW, Daimler, ThyssenKrupp, Fraunhofer- ILT, -IWU and others. A diode laser with an output power of 10 kW was set up to achieve acceptable process speed. Furthermore a homogenizing zoom-optics was developed, providing a rectangular focus with homogeneous power density. The spot size in x- and y-direction can be changed independently during operation. With pyrometer controlled laser power the surface temperature is kept constant, thus the laser treated zone can be flexibly adapted to the needs. Deep-drawing experiments show significant improvement in formability. With this technique, parts can be manufactured, which can conventionally only be made of steel with lower strength. Locally reduced strength of press hardened serial parts was demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{attempts}} at {{a contribution to}} peak load pricing, in both theory and application. The general result from the traditional theory that charges the off-peak consumers marginal operating costs only and the peak users marginal operating plus marginal capacity costs, {{since it is the}} on-peakers who <b>press</b> against <b>capacity,</b> has already been called into question in the literature. It has also been shown that the equity norms are violated in the traditional peak load pricing, whereby off-peak users pay no capacity charges, but are supplied output out of the capacity, `bought/hired' by the on-peakers. Theoretical {{attempts at}} modification have proved that the traditional conclusion holds only for homogeneous plant capacity (e. g., in one plant case), and in economic loading of two or more plants, the off-peak price also includes a part of capacity costs. This paper, however, shows that if the off-peak period output is explicitly expressed in terms of capacity utilisation of that period, the result will be an off-peak price including a fraction of the capacity cost in proportion to its significance relative to total utilisation. This would appear as a general case, irrespective of the nature of generation technology, that is, even when there is only one plant. We also give an illustration by estimating marginal costs and peak load prices using time series data on the Kerala power system. Where the data are incapable of yielding the required statistically determined long-run relationship among the variables under study, we propose a simple and viable method of using discrete ratio of increments in lieu of a marginal value.
