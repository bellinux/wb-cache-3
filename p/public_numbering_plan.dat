50|$|E.164 is an ITU-T recommendation, titled The {{international}} <b>public</b> telecommunication <b>numbering</b> <b>plan,</b> {{that defines}} a <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> for the world-wide {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN) {{and some other}} data networks.|$|R
50|$|U.S. Route 95 {{was one of}} the {{original}} U.S. highways proposed in the 1925 Bureau of <b>Public</b> Roads <b>numbering</b> <b>plan.</b> Under {{the original}} proposal, the highway would only exist in Idaho, from Payette to the Canada-US border north of Eastport. When the plan was adopted by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials in November 1926, the route of US 95 had been approved south to Weiser, still existing solely in Idaho. A proposal to extend US 95 south to Winnemucca, Nevada was considered by AASHO in 1937; however, action was deferred due to sections in Oregon that were incomplete. AASHTO reconsidered the idea at its meeting on June 28, 1939, {{as part of a larger}} plan to extend the highway south to Blythe, California. This plan was adopted at that meeting and became effective on January 1, 1940.|$|R
50|$|A {{telephone}} <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> {{is a type}} of {{numbering scheme}} used in telecommunication to assign telephone numbers to subscriber telephones or other telephony endpoints. Telephone numbers are the addresses of participants in a telephone network, reachable by a system of destination code routing. Telephone <b>numbering</b> <b>plans</b> are defined in each of administrative regions of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and they are also present in private telephone networks. For <b>public</b> <b>number</b> systems, geographic location plays a role in the sequence of numbers assigned to each telephone subscriber.|$|R
40|$|ENUM {{effectively}} bridges {{the telephone}} and Internet worlds by placing telephone numbers from the ITU Rec. E. 164 <b>public</b> telecommunication <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> into the Internet Domain Name System (DNS) as domain names. ENUM potentially presents significant public policy issues at both the domestic and international levels. Ultimately, it should not matter whether ENUM is approached as a telecommunications issue or an Internet issue because: (1) they are becoming the same thing technically, and (2) they engage the same global public interests. For the same reasons as apply to traditional telecommunications, and even to the Internet itself, public oversight of ENUM naming, numbering, and addressing resources is justified both by technical necessity {{and the interests of}} consumer protection (particularly personal privacy) and competition at higher service layers. A single, coordinated global DNS domain for at least Tier 0 (the international level) of the ENUM names hierarchy should be designated by public authorities. Many of the technical characteristics and policy considerations relevant at the ENUM Tier 0 and 1 zones are also directly applicable to the Internet's IP address space and DNS root (or Tier 0) zone - key shared elements of the Internet's logical infrastructure. Despite the fundamentally international nature of the Internet's logical infrastructure layer, and the purported privatization of administration of its IP address space and the DNS, Internet governance is not yet truly international. The ENUM policy debate illustrates the need for authoritative international public oversight of public communications network logical infrastructure, including that of traditional telecommunications, the Internet, and ENUM.

50|$|<b>Numbering</b> <b>plans</b> {{may follow}} {{a variety of}} design {{strategies}} which have often arisen from the historical evolution of individual telephone networks and local requirements. A broad division is commonly recognized, distinguishing open <b>numbering</b> <b>plans</b> and closed <b>numbering</b> <b>plans.</b> Many <b>numbering</b> <b>plans</b> subdivide their territory of service into geographic regions designated by a prefix, often called area code, which {{is a set of}} digits forming the most-significant part of the dialing sequence to reach a telephone subscriber.|$|R
50|$|The Venezuelan <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan</b> {{is an open}} {{telephone}} <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> with three-digit area {{codes and}} seven-digit telephone numbers that directs telephone calls to particular regions on a {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN) or to a mobile telephone network, where they are further routed by the local network.

50|$|The {{telephone}} <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> of the USSR {{was a set}} {{of telephone}} area codes, numbers and dialing rules, which operated in the Soviet Union until the 1990s. After {{the collapse of the}} USSR, many newly independent republics implemented their own <b>numbering</b> <b>plans.</b> However, many of the principles of the Soviet <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> still remain. The former Soviet international code +7 is still retained by Russia and Kazakhstan.|$|R
50|$|Many {{telephone}} <b>numbering</b> <b>plans</b> {{are structured}} based on divisions into geographic {{areas of the}} service territory. Each area identified in the plan is assigned a numeric routing code. This concept was first developed for Operator Toll Dialing of the Bell System in the early 1940s, which preceded the North American <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan</b> (NANP) of 1947. The system divided the North American service territories into <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> areas (NPAs), and called the numerical prefix the <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> area code, which became known in a short-form as area code. The area code is prefixed to each telephone number assigned.|$|R
50|$|Area code 402 is the {{telephone}} <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> code for eastern Nebraska in the North American <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan.</b> It {{was one of}} the original area codes created in 1947, and served the entire state.|$|R
50|$|Area code 660 is the {{telephone}} <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> code for Northern and Western Missouri in the North American <b>Numbering</b> <b>Plan.</b> It was created on October 12, 1997 as a split from area code 816.|$|R
50|$|The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has {{established}} a comprehensive <b>numbering</b> <b>plan,</b> designated E.164, for uniform interoperability of the networks of its member state or regional administrations.

50|$|The E.164 {{standard}} of the International Telecommunications Union {{is an international}} <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> and establishes a country calling code (country code) for each member organization. Country codes are prefixes to national telephone numbers that denote call routing to the network of a subordinate <b>number</b> <b>plan</b> administration, typically a country, or group of countries with a uniform <b>numbering</b> <b>plan,</b> such as the NANP. E.164 permits a maximum length of 15 digits for the complete international phone number consisting of the country code, the national routing code (area code), and the subscriber number. E.164 does not define regional <b>numbering</b> <b>plans,</b> however, it does provide recommendations for new implementations and uniform representation of all telephone numbers.|$|R
50|$|While the {{national}} <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> of the NANP {{was designed as}} a 10-digit closed plan, international direct distance dialing (IDDD) was accomplished by extensive modifications in switching systems to accommodate an open international <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> for telephone <b>numbers</b> from 7 to 12 digits.|$|R
50|$|Telephone {{numbers in}} the United Kingdom are {{administered}} by the UK government's Office of Communications (Ofcom).
