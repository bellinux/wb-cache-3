There is a number of options available in managing legacy systems. Typical solutions include: discarding the system and building a replacement one; freezing the system and {{using it as a}} component of a new larger system; modifying the system to give it another lease of life. Modifications may range from a simplification of the system (reduction of size and complexity) to ordinary <b>preventive</b> maintenance (redocumentation, <b>restructuring</b> and reengineering) or even to an extraordinary process of adaptive maintenance (interface modification, wrapping and migration). These possibilities are not alternative to each other but making decisions on which approach, or combination of approaches, is most suitable for any particular legacy system are usually taken on the basis of conventional wisdom. Like any decision process, it req...|$|R

The {{following}} {{project was}} developed in Industries MAFAM S. A., also known commercially as Nutrisnacks, and whose economic activity is in the food sector, {{with a wide variety}} of products like cookies, bars and snacks. This project aims to give the maintenance department the tools and management mechanisms required to improve the availability of equipment, as well as facilitate the organization and planning department due to the expansion of the plant, which since July 2016 is working to triple its production. In the diagnosis of the current situation, it's possible to delimit the problems that the department has, in which planning and information management are the main points against the department to increase its efficiency, for this reason is designed and elaborated a software for maintenance, this through the program Microsoft Excel to handle all the departmental information, from the management of spare parts and inputs, such as the management of the work done and programming of the Preventive maintenance plans that they wish to restructure. As mentioned above, the company requires a <b>restructured</b> <b>preventive</b> maintenance plans for all machines, because there are no maintenance manuals or a study of machine requirements based in manufactured technician’s aspects and the requirements due to the work environment in which they are submitted, for this reason it's proposed to make a preventive maintenance program based on failure mode effects analysis, which is executed with the help of technical staff and operators. Finally, the proposed maintenance management will be carried out to use the preventive maintenance plans efficiently, in addition to defining a course for the department, efficiently managing its information and controlling both spare parts and supplies and the work performed by the technician’s staff.
