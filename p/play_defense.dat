5|$|In the 1956 NBA draft, Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach had set {{his sights}} on Russell, {{thinking}} his defensive toughness and rebounding prowess were the missing pieces the Celtics needed. In retrospect, Auerbach's thoughts were unorthodox. In that period, centers and forwards were defined by their offensive output, and their ability to <b>play</b> <b>defense</b> was secondary.|$|E
5|$|After the Kansas kickoff, Virginia Tech {{took over}} at its 33-yard line. Needing a score, the Hokies {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty before quarterback Sean Glennon was sacked by Kansas' Mike Rivera. The two plays pushed the Virginia Tech offense back, {{preventing them from}} gaining a first down. Forced to punt the ball away, Virginia Tech had to <b>play</b> <b>defense</b> as Kansas took over at its 28-yard line. Secure in their lead, Kansas elected to run the ball {{in an effort to}} keep the clock moving and bring the game to an end more quickly. Brandon McAnderson broke free for 28yards on the first play of the drive, and Jake Sharp contributed another first down on the ground before the Hokie defense stopped Kansas on an attempt to earn a first down on a fourth-and-two deep inside Virginia Tech territory.|$|E
5|$|The 53rd {{edition of}} the annual Gator Bowl game kicked off on January 1, 1998. An {{estimated}} 54,116 fans were in attendance at the game, which was held in Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium, since renamed Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. The game was televised on NBC, and an estimated 5.1 million Americans watched the broadcast, giving the game a television rating of 3.7, 12th highest of the 21 bowl games that season. Charlie Jones, Bob Trumpy, John Dockery were the sportscasters of the broadcast. During the week prior to the game, the weather had been cold and rainy, with temperatures in the mid-40s and more than two inches of rain. At kickoff, the weather was clear, with temperatures near 55 degrees.

5|$|Bogosian {{was born}} to Ike and Vicky Bogosian in Massena, New York, a town of 13,000 {{adjacent}} to the Saint Lawrence River. He is the first NHL player of Armenian descent; his great-grandfather, Stephen Bogosian, left Western Armenia in 1923 {{at the age of}} 16 {{as a result of the}} Armenian Genocide. At the age of 2½, Bogosian first began to skate. He joined the Massena Minor Hockey Association when he was 3, staying in the program until he was 14, when he left for Cushing Academy. Bogosian first began to <b>play</b> <b>defense</b> at the Squirt level (under-10); though he was smaller than most of his peers, he was a good skater. He alternated between forward and defense throughout minor hockey. When he began attending Cushing Academy he was a forward the first year, before he converted to a defender full-time. After leaving the school and moving to Canada with two years of high school to complete, Bogosian took courses on the internet.|$|E
5|$|McCoy {{was born}} in Hobbs, New Mexico. He is the eldest of three {{children}} born to Steven Brad McCoy and Debra Kay (Woodruff) McCoy. He attended Jim Ned High School in Tuscola, Texas, population 714, where he was coached in football by his father, Brad McCoy. He achieved several distinctions {{as a high school}} player, including two-time Associated Press 2A Offensive MVP and First-team All-state selection. Over his career, he completed 536-of-849 passes (63.1%) for 9,344 yards and 116 TDs. He ranks as the all-time leading passer in Texas Division 2A high school history and is fourth overall in Texas high school history. McCoy also served as Jim Ned High School's punter as a junior and senior. During his sophomore year, McCoy was also playing free safety. However, after he suffered a concussion while tackling 215-pound Bangs High School running back Jacoby Jones (not {{to be confused with the}} Baltimore Ravens wide receiver of the same name), his father decided not to let him <b>play</b> <b>defense</b> anymore. At the time Jim Ned was 8–0, but as McCoy missed the next two games due to the concussion, Jim Ned's season unraveled. McCoy also played in the 2003 Texas 2A State Championship against the San Augustine Wolves. Jim Ned lost 28–7.|$|E

He grew about 12 more cm {{in the next couple}} of years and could do everything on the court: <b>play</b> <b>defense,</b> assist his teammates, shoot 3 pointers and dominate inside the paint.|$|E
25|$|With {{the game}} tied, both teams {{returned}} to the field for an overtime coin toss. Michigan won the toss and elected to <b>play</b> <b>defense</b> first.

On third down, Thomas threw a pass into the endzone to Coale. The play was originally ruled a touchdown, but was overturned after a lengthy video review. Myer then lined up for a 37-yard field goal, but pushed it to the right, giving Michigan the ball and the opportunity to win the game with a field goal.|$|E

On Boise State's drive, the Broncos came down to 4th and 2 on the Sooners' 5yard line and decided to run their second trick play, a wide receiver rollout option from {{a variant of the}} Wildcat offense. Zabransky ran in motion to his left while backup wide receiver Vinny Perretta, lined up as a running back, took the snap, rolled to his right, then threw a touchdown pass to tight end Derek Schouman, who had lined up as a wide receiver, to bring Boise State within one point at 42–41.|$|E
25|$|After {{playing as}} a left halfback {{for his first}} four seasons, Trippi {{switched}} to quarterback during 1951 and 1952. On December 15, 1951, on frozen turf in Wrigley Field, Trippi completed nine passes for 106 yards and carried 11 times for 145 yards, accounting for three touchdowns as the Cardinals defeated the Bears 24–14. Following the 1952 season, {{he was invited to}} the Pro Bowl as a backup quarterback for the American Conference. Trippi moved back to offensive halfback for one season and again was invited to the Pro Bowl. He then switched over to <b>play</b> <b>defense</b> in 1954, recording three pass interceptions as a defensive back. He also became the Cardinals' primary punter for 1953 and 1954, and had a career punting average of over 40 yards per punt. His career essentially ended in the 1955 preseason when he was tackled by John Henry Johnson of the San Francisco 49ers, which left Trippi with a smashed nose, a concussion, and a protruding bone behind his eye that gave him double vision. He appeared in only five games that season and did not record any statistics on offense. Trippi retired on December 13, 1955, a day before his 33rd birthday. At the time, his 6,053 yards of total offense (3,506 rushing, 2,547 passing, and 1,321 receiving) was the most by a player in NFL history, and he had compiled the fourth-most all-purpose yards of any player (7,148).|$|E
500|$|Suter was {{the third}} member of his family to <b>play</b> <b>defense</b> for the Wisconsin Badgers, {{following}} brothers John and Bob. He appeared in 34 games in 1983–84, scoring 22 points. Ian McKenzie, coordinator of scouting for the Calgary Flames, noticed Suter's play at Wisconsin {{and that he had}} added over two inches of height, which Central Scouting had failed to update in its record on him. The Flames picked Suter with their ninth round selection, 180th overall, in the 1984 Draft. [...] Suter, who had been working in a beer factory, was initially disappointed at his selection. [...] He was in his last year of draft eligibility and was hoping to follow other college players who signed lucrative contracts as free agents after going unselected. Following his sophomore season of 1984–85, in which he recorded 51 points in 39 games for Wisconsin, Suter left Wisconsin to turn professional.|$|E

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1944, Rifenburg {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan. The United Press syndicate ran a feature article about Rifenburg in September 1944 that opened as follows: [...] "Another great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon {{in the person of}} Dick Rifenburg, 18-year-old Michigan freshman. Every so often a great offensive end comes along, a player who has to learn how to <b>play</b> <b>defense,</b> but who has the natural speed, smooth actions, height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver. Rifenburg has laid claim to that rating. A loose-limbed 180-pound freshman from Saginaw, Mich., Rifenberg is being boomed as the Big Ten's next 'freshman sensation.'" [...] As a freshman, he caught two touchdown passes in his first college football game against Iowa. In an article titled [...] "Teens and TNT," [...] Time reported on Rifenburg's performance: [...] "Of the few teams already in action, Michigan's teens rang the freshman bell loudest last week by winning their opener, 12 -to-7, against the strong Iowa Seahawks (Naval Pre-Flight); 6-ft. 4 Freshman End Dick Rifenburg caught passes and ran for both Michigan touchdowns." ...|$|E
500|$|From a {{historical}} NBA perspective, the rivalry between Chamberlain and his perennial nemesis Bill Russell is {{cited as the}} greatest on-court rivalry of all time. There were three NBA Finals matchups in the rivalry between Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, but they played different positions and did not guard each other. Russell's Celtics won seven of eight playoff series against Chamberlain's Warriors, 76ers, and Lakers teams, and went 57–37 against them {{in the regular season}} and 29–20 in the playoffs. Russell's teams won all four seventh games against Chamberlain's—the combined margin was nine points. Chamberlain outscored Russell 30 to 14.2 per game and outrebounded him 28.2 to 22.9 in the regular season, and also in the playoffs, he outscored him 25.7 to 14.9 and outrebounded him 28 to 24.7. The comparison between the two is often simplified to a great player (Chamberlain) versus a player who makes his team great (Russell), an individualist against a team player. In [...] when Chamberlain averaged 50.4 points per game, he noted that Boston did not rely on Russell's scoring, and he could concentrate on defense and rebounding. He wished people would understand that their roles were different. Chamberlain said, [...] "I've got to hit forty points or so, or this team is in trouble. I must score—understand? After that I <b>play</b> <b>defense</b> and get the ball off the boards. I try to do them all, best I can, but scoring comes first." [...] Russell won 11 NBA titles in his career while Chamberlain won two. Chamberlain was named All-NBA first team seven times to Russell's three, but Russell was named league MVP—then selected by players and not the press—five times against Chamberlain's four. Russell and Chamberlain were friends in private life. Russell never considered Chamberlain his rival and disliked the term, instead pointing out that they rarely talked about basketball when they were alone. When Chamberlain died in 1999, Chamberlain's nephew stated that Russell was the second person he was ordered to break the news to. The two did not speak for two decades after Russell criticized Chamberlain after Game 7 of the 1969 Finals. Russell apologized privately to Chamberlain and later publicly.|$|E

Jeffrey Noble, another retired police officer and expert in use-of-force cases (who had himself used deadly force on the job), said he was attacked by prosecutors for saying that the officers never should have escalated the situation by rushing Rice, adding, [...] "I’ve definitely never seen two prosecutors <b>play</b> <b>defense</b> attorney so well." [...] And Jesse Wobrock, a biomechanics expert hired by the Rice family's lawyers, also described the prosecutors as [...] "acting in a way like they were defense attorneys for the cops," [...] and as having attacked him professionally for his testimony regarding the timing and significance of body movements by Loehmann and Rice, as seen on video footage of the shooting. (A spokesman for McGinty's office said the three experts were only presenting [...] "one side" [...] of the story, but he could not elaborate because prosecutors are bound by grand jury secrecy laws.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Blazers valued Petrović as a shooter, {{but were}} {{concerned}} {{that he might not}} possess the quickness to play guard or the foot speed to <b>play</b> <b>defense.</b> They brought him onto the team primarily as an outside threat to shoot three-pointers. In the Blazers' offensive scheme he was to set up behind the line, receive a passed ball and go directly up to release his shot. Petrović was an aggressive, attacking player who was used to creating his shot and shots for his teammates. Taking the ball out of his hands and making him a static shooter was foreign to him. Making matters worse, the Blazers already had a full rotation of guards, with a starting backcourt of Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter, and with veteran Danny Young as a reserve. Consequently, the reigning La Gazzetta dello Sport Euroscar European Player of the Year saw limited playing time. He had difficulty being productive in the limited role the Blazers had for him. In his rookie year during the 1989–90 NBA season, he averaged 7.4 points in 12 minutes playing time per game. The following season veteran guard Danny Ainge was added to the team, and Petrović's playing time dropped further to 7 minutes a game. In many statements made prior to arriving in Portland, Petrović had said he saw a lack of playing time as the only possible obstacle to his success in the NBA. He was determined to be a success in basketball's highest arena. His lack of playing time during his second season in the league brought Petrović's frustration to a climax: ...|$|E
