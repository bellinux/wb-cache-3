25|$|Unfortunately, {{human rights}} {{violations}} tend to be common during insurgencies and counterinsurgency efforts. Western powers conducting multiple foreign internal defense (FID) operations are coming under increasing pressure to provide human rights and Geneva Conventions training to host nation personnel, although the results vary. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> arrives when host nation personnel gets involved in combat without FID advisers, {{who are supposed to}} monitor their conduct and prevent abuses. The 1980-1992 Salvadoran Civil War, where {{human rights violations}} were documented on both sides, can be cited as an example.|$|E

25|$|After a {{round robin}} within each zone, {{the winners of}} each zone get a Hawke Cup Challenge as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> series against the current holders on a {{rotational}} basis. For example 2010/11 holders North Otago played the winner of their own zone (Otago Country) in the first challenge (or the second place team should they win their own zone) followed by challenges by the winners of zone 3, 2 and 1. The team with the Hawke Cup {{at the end of}} the challenge series holds it for the winter. Hawke Cup games are played over 3 days. To win the Hawke Cup a challenger must beat the holder outright or win on the first innings on the holder's home ground.|$|E
25|$|In October 2006, a legal {{challenge}} was mounted to overturn these patents by The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights and the non-profit patent-watchdog Public Patent Foundation. They contended {{that two of}} the patents granted to WARF are invalid because they cover a technique published in 1992 for which a patent had already been granted to an Australian researcher. Another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> came from the molecular biologist Jeanne Loring who stated that University of Wisconsin–Madison stem cell pioneer James Thomson's techniques (currently patents held by WARF) are rendered obvious by a 1990 paper and two textbooks. The outcome of this {{legal challenge}} was particularly relevant to the Geron Corporation as it can only license patents that are upheld. The patents were ultimately upheld when the reexamination concluded in 2008.|$|E
25|$|The Parabolica corner was altered {{ahead of}} the race weekend, with {{a large portion of}} the turn's gravel trap removed and {{replaced}} with an asphalt run-off area. It was reported that the alteration was made ahead of a possible return of the Superbike World Championship in 2015 after series officials raised concerns about the lack of run-off areas on the circuit. The change was heavily criticised by the sport's fan base on social media and certain drivers who felt it removed <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> from Parabolica. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile race director Charlie Whiting, however, defended the changes, revealing that drivers and the sport's governing body asked for alterations to be made for safety reasons but acknowledged the turn may not provide much of a challenge as it previously did. Others, including Romain Grosjean joined in Whiting's defence, with him believing the gravel trap's removal would enable drivers to find their limit more quickly because of the lack of fear of a large accident in the event of problems.|$|E

500|$|Creator Arthur Miller {{described}} the role as {{one for a}} large character in a small physical body and noted he had difficulty finding the right actor at first. Loman's Brooklyn accent is <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of the role. In 1950, Miller described Loman {{as a man who}} upon hearing society's [...] "thundering command to succeed" [...] found himself staring at a failure in the mirror. The Amazon.com editorial review by Ali Davis states that [...] "Willy Loman is a salesman desperately hustling for a living even as he slides into old age." [...] Rovi Corporation's Matthew Tobey describes him as an everyman who has to cope with the sudden realization that he is over the hill and does so with a fantasy world in which he remains important. The Huffington Posts theater critic, Wilborn Hampton, describes the role as [...] "one of the most complicated characters in dramatic literature", making it a draw for the great actors.|$|E
500|$|Early in the {{development}} of XIII, Serah {{was meant to be a}} playable character, but was eventually delegated to a supporting character because of technical issues. Tetsuya Nomura, in an interview, said that he designed Serah's hair so that her silhouette would mirror Lightning's. For XIII-2, the developers decided to change Serah and Lightning's roles, with Serah becoming the game's main protagonist, while Lightning was the object of her quest. Yusuke Naora was told to design Serah's new costume like the [...] "plug suit" [...] outfits from Neon Genesis Evangelion and was asked to give her a necklace for plot reasons. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> for the game was making Serah more active, but maintaining her femininity, which is the reason she was given a bow as her weapon. Another reason behind the design of her weapon was the fact that the developers wanted to give the characters means to attack both up close and at long range. Aside from Naora's design, Yuko Oshima of AKB48 was asked to design two potential DLC outfits for Serah: a black combat outfit titled [...] "Exposure and Defense" [...] (later retitled [...] "Style and Steel"), and a second red-and-white outfit titled [...] "Little Red Riding Hood", meant to be indicative of Serah's change into an adult. After a popular vote, the former costume was chosen and released in April 2012. Serah is voiced by Laura Bailey in English and by Minako Kotobuki in Japanese.|$|E

60|$|Now Herd's version {{says nothing}} of Douglas at Newcastle; {{the whole scene}} is at Otterburn. On the other hand, Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe's MS. text DID bring Douglas to Newcastle. Of this Colonel Elliot says nothing. The English version says NOTHING OF PERCY'S LOSS OF HIS PENNON TO DOUGLAS (nor does Sharpe's), and gives the {{challenge}} and tryst. Scott's version says nothing of Percy's pennon, but Douglas takes Percy's SWORD and vows to carry it home. Percy's challenge, in the English version, {{is accompanied by a}} gross absurdity. He bids Douglas wait at Otterburn, where, pour tout potage to an army absurdly stated at 40,000 men, Percy suggests venison and pheasants! In the Scottish version Percy offers tryst at Otterburn. Douglas answers that, though Otterburn has no supplies--nothing but deer and wild birds--he will there tarry for Percy. This is chivalrous, and, in Scott's version, Douglas understands war. In the English version Percy does not. (To these facts I return, giving more details.) Colonel Elliot supposes some one (Scott, I daresay) to have taken Percy's,--the English version,--altered it to taste, concealed the alterations, as in this <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge,</b> by inverting the speeches and writing new stanzas of the fight at Otterburn, used a very little of Herd (which is true), and inserted modern stanzas.|$|E
