5000|$|The Chilean <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>Policy</b> was {{an attempt}} in the 1960s and 1970s to {{introduce}} a rational national pharmaceuticals policy. Chile was perhaps the first {{country in the world}} to introduce the concept of a limited number of essential drugs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>policy</b> {{may also}} {{encompass}} how drugs are provided to beneficiaries. This includes {{the mechanics of}} drug distribution and dispensing {{as well as the}} funding of such services. For example, some HMOs in the US use a ‘central fill’ approach where all prescriptions are packaged and shipped from a central location instead of at a community pharmacy. In other jurisdictions, retail pharmacies are compensated for dispensing drugs to eligible beneficiaries. A state-operated approach may also be taken, as with Sweden’s Apoteket, which had the monopoly on retail pharmacy until 2009, and was not-for-profit. <b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>policy</b> may also subsidize smaller, more marginal pharmacies, using the rationale that they are needed health care providers. The UK’s Essential Small Pharmacies Scheme works this way.|$|E

50|$|Pharmacy (pharmacy {{administration}}): Pharmacy {{administration is}} a dynamic field that applies approaches from management science, economics, {{and the social sciences}} to issues in health care that relate to pharmacy, pharmacists, and pharmaceuticals.

50|$|Pharmacy and Therapeutics is a {{committee}} {{at a hospital}} or an insurance plan that meets to decide which drugs will appear on that entity's drug formulary.

40|$|<b>Pharmaceutical</b> <b>policies</b> form a {{substantial}} part of health care services, {{from the point of view}} of both equity and efficiency goals. Expenditure on pharmaceuticals has been growing steadily over the last few decades, and countries are finding the financing of drugs increasingly difficult. This article surveys the changes in <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>policies</b> in the E. U. countries from the mid- 1980 s through the 1990 s. It focuses primarily on policies dealing with cost control of publicly funded pharmaceuticals. In their analysis of these changes, the authors classify policies (or "packages of measures"), map out their incidence in each country, and assess their impact on the control of public pharmaceutical spending. They conclude that the E. U. countries are taking up apparently similar measures [...] dressing like penguins in a row [...] despite the limited effectiveness and limited evaluation of many of the measures adopted. The authors also analyze the role of national and international actors (most prominently, the European Union) in defining public pharmaceutical policies; look at how innovative policy ideas could be connected with the economic, political, and social interests that mold public action in this field; and propose new lines of investigation.
