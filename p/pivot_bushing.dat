5000|$|For the Weissach axle, {{the front}} <b>pivot</b> <b>bushing</b> of the {{trailing}} arm {{is replaced by}} a short link. In this arrangement, when the vehicle decelerates and the wheel is [...] "pulled" [...] back, the result is toe in. This adds to stability and thus, reduces oversteer.|$|E
40|$|NASA s Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Project {{will send}} a six-wheeled rover to Mars in 2009. The rover will carry a {{scientific}} payload designed to search for organic molecules on the Martian surface during its primary mission. This paper describes the development and testing of a bonded film lubricated bushing system {{to be used in}} the mobility system of the rover. The MSL Rover Mobility System contains several pivots that are tightly constrained with respect to mass and volume. These pivots are also exposed to relatively low temperatures (- 135 C) during operation. The combination of these constraints led the mobility team to consider the use of solid film lubricated metallic bushings and dry running polymeric bushings in several flight pivot applications. A test program was developed to mitigate the risk associated with using these materials in critical pivots on the MSL vehicle. The program was designed to characterize bushing friction and wear performance over the expected operational temperature range (- 135 C to + 70 C). Seven different bushing material / lubricant combinations were evaluated to aid in the selection of the final flight <b>pivot</b> <b>bushing</b> material / lubricant combination...|$|E
40|$|Some of {{the common}} faults {{associated}} with suspension components are damaged or leaking shock absorbers, spring weakness, wearing down of the <b>pivot</b> and <b>bushing</b> and damage to the main support member assembly. To investigate these problems, a seven degree-of-freedom (7 - DOF) model has been developed, for a full vehicle, using MATLAB. In the simulation, the suspension faults have been considered via the damage caused to the shock absorbers (dampers) and the faults were seeded by reducing the damper coefficient by 25...|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} wear on {{a roller chain}} is to {{increase}} the pitch (spacing of the links), causing the chain to grow longer. Note that this is due to wear at the <b>pivoting</b> pins and <b>bushes,</b> not from actual stretching of the metal (as does happen to some flexible steel components such as the hand-brake cable of a motor vehicle).|$|R
