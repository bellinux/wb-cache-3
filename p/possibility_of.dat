40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to make use <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> stochastically {{informative}} expertise system, adapting it for the analysis of interactions between the tax scale and structure with changes in the labour market. In this article, stochastically informative expertise is understood as a case of expert evaluation, when the expert estimate <b>of</b> the <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> the analysed characteristic are presented as probability distributions. The authors aim to constructively merge the idea of stochastically informative expertise with <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> correlation and regression analysis methods. On one hand, <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> the correlation regression analysis to determine the characteristics and forms of dependencies are achieved taking into account the influence of the indeterminate. On the other hand, the method of stochastically informative expertise used together with <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> imitative modelling allows the information obtained through correlation regression analysis to be used for the description by their value probability distributions of the indicators of analysed interactions, this way naturally merging the <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> effectiveness and reliability while assessing the interactive processes between the labour market and taxes or social insurance contributions...|$|R
