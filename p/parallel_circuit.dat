2500|$|Zobel {{networks}} {{can be used}} to {{make the}} impedance a loudspeaker presents to its amplifier output appear as a steady resistance. [...] This is beneficial to the amplifier performance. [...] The impedance of a loudspeaker is partly resistive. [...] The resistance represents the energy transferred from the amplifier to the sound output plus some heating losses in the loudspeaker. [...] However, the speaker also possesses inductance due to the windings of its coil. [...] The impedance of the loudspeaker is thus typically modelled as a series resistor and inductor. [...] A <b>parallel</b> <b>circuit</b> of a series resistor and capacitor of the correct values will form a Zobel bridge. [...] It is obligatory to choose [...] because the centre point between the inductor and resistor is inaccessible (and, in fact, fictitious - the resistor and inductor are distributed quantities as in a transmission line). [...] The loudspeaker may be modelled more accurately by a more complex equivalent circuit. [...] The compensating Zobel network will also become more complex to the same degree.|$|E

A by-product of these equations is the decimation process, which enables substituted-benzenes to be mapped onto corresponding dimers, {{that are used to}} construct the series and <b>parallel</b> <b>circuits</b> of single-, double- and triple-dimers. The transmittivities of these circuits are calculated by the Lippmann-Schwinger theory, which yields the transmissionenergy function T(E). The average value of T(E) provides a measure of the electron transport in the circuit in question. The undulating nature of the T (E) profiles give rise to resonances (T = 1) and anti-resonances (T = 0) across the energy spectrum. Analysis {{of the structure of the}} T (E) graphs highlights the distinguishing features associated with the homo- and hetero-geneous series and <b>parallel</b> <b>circuits.</b> Noteworthy results include the preponderance of p-dimers in circuits with high T (E) values, and the fact that <b>parallel</b> <b>circuits</b> tend to be better transmitters than their series counterparts...|$|R
