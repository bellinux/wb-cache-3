50|$|T {{cells are}} {{produced}} in the thymus, and upon leaving they migrate to and around the lymphoid organs of the body, including lymph nodes. In the <b>paracortex</b> of the lymphoid nodes {{they are exposed to}} professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs). Specific interactions between the naïve T cells and their cognate antigens result in T cell activation. The activated T cells, immunoblasts, undergo clonal expansion before acquiring effector functions. The activated T cells then emigrate from the lymph nodes, via the efferent lymphatic vessel, and migrate around the body in the blood.|$|E

40|$|After {{entry into}} lymph nodes (LNs), B cells migrate to follicles, whereas T cells {{remain in the}} <b>paracortex,</b> with each {{lymphocyte}} type showing apparently random migration within these distinct areas. Other than chemokines, the factors contributing to this spatial segregation and to the observed patterns of lymphocyte movement are poorly characterized. By combining confocal, electron, and intravital microscopy, we showed that the fibroblastic reticular cell network regulated naive T cell access to the <b>paracortex</b> and also supported and defined the limits of T cell movement within this domain, whereas a distinct follicular dendritic cell network similarly served as the substratum for movement of follicular B cells.

40|$|Professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are {{sentinel}} {{cells of}} the immune system that present antigen to T lymphocytes and mediate an appropriate immune response. It is therefore surprising that knowledge of the professional APCs in human lymph nodes is limited. Using 3 -color immunohistochemistry, we have identified APCs in human lymph nodes, excluding plasmacytoid APCs, that fall into 2 nonoverlapping classes: (1) CD 209 + APCs, coexpressing combinations of CD 206, CD 14, and CD 68, that occupied the medullary cords, lined the capsule and trabeculae and were also scattered throughout the diffuse T-lymphocyte areas of the paracortex; and (2) APCs expressing combinations of CD 1 a, CD 207, and CD 208, that were always restricted to the <b>paracortex.</b> Surprisingly, this second class of APCs was almost entirely absent from many lymph nodes. Our data suggest that most CD 208 + cells, often referred to as “interdigitating cells,” derive from migratory APCs, and that the major APC subset consistently resident in the <b>paracortex</b> of human lymph nodes is the CD 209 + subset. All APC subsets were demonstrated to be in close contact with the fibroreticular network. The identification of 2 distinct APC populations in the <b>paracortex</b> of human lymph nodes has important implications for understanding T-lymphocyte responses and optimizing vaccine design...|$|E

The injected particles reached these nodes via liver lymph but the i. v. route of administration eliminated any possibility of disturbing either lymph flow or pressure. Particles began to enter hepatic hilar nodes only after an interval of 7 - 8 h. They were subsequently redistributed from marginal, trabecular and medullary sinuses to the <b>paracortex</b> and finally to medullary cords.

30|$|In the LN, DCs located {{around the}} T cell entry site express Epstein-Barr virus induced {{receptor}} ligand chemokine (ELC) or chemokine ligand 9 (CCL 19) and secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC) or CCL 21 that enhance DC-T cell attraction. In the LN <b>paracortex,</b> B cells bind Ags with their surface immunoglobulins and become activated. As a result, they rapidly differentiate in plasma cells and produce low-affinity antibody (Ab).

40|$|The “normal” {{lymph node}} {{has been studied}} by {{electron}} microscopy. The lymphoid tissue {{can be divided into}} three distinct zones. Zone 1 consists of loosely arranged cells surrounding the lymphatic sinuses and blood vessels. This is the only zone in which plasma cells are present. Zone 2 is surrounded by zone 1 and consists of compactly arranged cells in which lymphocytes predominate. Zone 3 (germinal center) appears only after antigenic stimulation. It is characterized by large, ribosome-rich cells and macrophages containing phagocytosed lymphocytes. These zones are arranged with their longest diameters pointing towards the hilus. Zone 1 is the longest and extends across the cortex, <b>paracortex</b> and medulla. Zone 2 spans across cortex and <b>paracortex.</b> Zone 3 usually is confined to the cortex.

40|$|Although the {{requirements}} for T lymphocyte homing to lymph nodes (LNs) are well studied, much less is known about {{the requirements}} for T lymphocyte locomotion within LNs. Imaging of murine T lymphocyte migration in explanted LNs using two-photon laser-scanning fluorescence microscopy provides an opportunity to systematically study these requirements. We have developed a closed system for imaging an intact LN with controlled temperature, oxygenation, and perfusion rate. Naive T lymphocyte locomotion in the deep <b>paracortex</b> of the LN required a perfusion rate of > 13 microm/s and a partial pressure of O(2) (pO(2)) of > 7. 4 %. Naive T lymphocyte locomotion in the subcapsular region was 38 % slower and had higher turning angles and arrest coefficients than naive T lymphocytes in the deep <b>paracortex.</b> T lymphocyte activation decreased the requirement for pO(2), but also decreased the speed of locomotion in the deep <b>paracortex.</b> Although CCR 7 (-/-) naive T cells displayed a small reduction in locomotion, systemic treatment with pertussis toxin reduced naive T lymphocyte speed by 59 %, indicating a contribution of Galpha(i) -mediated signaling, but involvement of other G protein-coupled receptors besides CCR 7. Receptor knockouts or pharmacological inhibition in the adenosine, PG/lipoxygenase, lysophosphatidylcholine, and sphingosine- 1 -phosphate pathways did not individually alter naive T cell migration. These data implicate pO(2), tissue architecture, and G-protein coupled receptor signaling in regulation of naive T lymphocyte migration in explanted LNs...|$|E
40|$|Persistent {{generalized}} lymphadenopathy often develops during HIV-infection. It {{is characterized by}} follicular hyperplasia which progresses over time to follicular involution and finally lymphocyte depletion. To determine whether activated cytotoxic T cells (CD 8 +) {{are present in the}} hyperplastic germinal centres, light and electronmicroscopic immunogold labelling with monoclonal antibodies were used to localize two cytotoxic molecules, perforin and TIA- 1. Perforin and TIA- 1 -positive cells were detected in the follicles and <b>paracortex</b> of lymph nodes from HIV-infected patients, whereas labelling was seen only in cells of the <b>paracortex</b> in the hyperplastic lymph nodes from HIV-negative patients. Cytotoxic granules, staining positive for perforin and TIA- 1, were identified by transmission electronmicroscopy, often in proximity to follicular dendritic cells within the hyperplastic germinal centres of only HIV-positive patients.

40|$|In {{this study}} biopsies from skin lesions and {{draining}} lymph nodes of patients suffering from cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major were examined by immunohistochemistry, and by light and electron microscopy {{to identify the}} types of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and their location. APC, identified morphologically and by their expression of specific cell markers, included Langerhans cells, macrophages, follicular dendritic cells, and interdigitating reticulum cells of the <b>paracortex</b> of lymph nodes. These cells expressed MHC class II antigens and contained Leishmania antigen. Since some keratinocytes and endothelial cells also showed these characteristics, they may also act as APC. By examining tissue samples from skin lesions and draining lymph nodes {{it was possible to}} follow the probable route of trafficking of various inflammatory cells between the skin lesion and lymph nodes. Leishmania antigen containing Langerhans cells were found in the epidermis, dermis and the regional lymph nodes. We believe these cells translocate from the epidermis to the dermis, where they take up antigen and migrate to the <b>paracortex</b> of the regional lymph nodes. There they are intimately associated with cells of the <b>paracortex,</b> and could be involved in the generation of Leishmania-specific T memory cells. LFA- 1 -positive T cells of the CD 45 RO phenotype were found in the skin lesion. Venular endothelium in the skin lesions expressed intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), which is the ligand for LFA- 1. The migration of lymphocytes from the vascular lumen to the site of inflammation is possibly a result of the interaction of these two adhesion molecules...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of AIDS virus {{infection in}} a nonhuman primate AIDS model was studied by comparing plasma viral loads, CD 4 + T-cell subpopulations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in lymph nodes for rhesus macaques infected with a pathogenic molecularly cloned SIVmac 239 strain and those infected with its nef deletion mutant (Δnef). In agreement with many reports, whereas SIVmac 239 infection induced AIDS and depletion of memory CD 4 + T cells in 2 to 3 years postinfection (p. i.), Δnef infection did not induce any manifestation associated with AIDS up to 6. 5 years p. i. To explore {{the difference in}} SIV infection in lymphoid tissues, we biopsied lymph nodes at 2, 8, 72, and 82 weeks p. i. and analyzed them by pathological techniques. Maximal numbers of SIV-infected cells (SIV Gag+, Env+, and RNA+) were detected at 2 weeks p. i. in both the SIVmac 239 -infected animals and the Δnef-infected animals. In the SIVmac 239 -infected animals, most of the infected cells were localized in the T-cell-rich <b>paracortex,</b> whereas in the Δnef-infected animals, most were localized in B-cell-rich follicles and in the border region between the <b>paracortex</b> and the follicles. Analyses by double staining of CD 68 + macrophages and SIV Gag+ cells and by double staining of CD 3 + T cells and SIV Env+ cells revealed that SIV-infected cells were identified as CD 4 + T cells in either the SIVmac 239 or the Δnef infection. Whereas the many functions of Nef protein were reported from in vitro studies, our finding of SIVmac 239 replication in the T-cell-rich <b>paracortex</b> in the lymph nodes supports the reported roles of Nef protein in T-cell activation and enhancement of viral infectivity. Furthermore, the abundance of SIVmac 239 infection and the paucity of Δnef infection in the T-cell-rich <b>paracortex</b> accounted for the differences in viral replication and pathogenicity between SIVmac 239 and the Δnef mutant. Thus, our in vivo study indicated that the nef gene enhances SIV replication by robust productive infection in memory CD 4 + T cells in the T-cell-rich region in lymphoid tissues...|$|E
40|$|Natural killer (NK) cells promote {{dendritic}} cell (DC) maturation and influence T cell differentiation in vitro. To {{better understand the}} nature of the putative interactions among these cells in vivo during the early phases of an adaptive immune response, we have used immunohistochemical analysis and dynamic intravital imaging to study NK cell localization and behavior in lymph nodes (LNs) in the steady state and shortly after infection with Leishmania major. In the LNs of naive mice, NK cells reside in the medulla and the <b>paracortex,</b> where they closely associate with DCs. In contrast to T cells, intravital microscopy revealed that NK cells in the superficial regions of LNs were slowly motile and maintained their interactions with DCs over extended times in {{the presence or absence of}} immune-activating signals. L. major induced NK cells to secrete interferon-gamma and to be recruited to the <b>paracortex,</b> where concomitant CD 4 T cell activation occurred.

40|$|In the <b>paracortex</b> of lymph nodes, {{cellular}} immune {{responses are}} generated against antigens captured in peripheral tissues by dendritic cells (DCs). DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific ICAM- 3 grabbing nonintegrin), a C-type lectin exclusively expressed by DCs, functions as an antigen receptor {{as well as}} an adhesion receptor. A functional homologue of DC-SIGN, L-SIGN (liver/lymph node-SIGN, also called DC-SIGN-related), is expressed by liver sinus endothelial cells. In lymph nodes, both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are expressed. In this study, we analyzed the distribution of these two SIGN molecules in detail in both normal and immunoreactive lymph nodes. DC-SIGN is expressed by mature DCs in paracortical areas and in addition by DCs with an immature phenotype in the outer zones of the <b>paracortex.</b> L-SIGN expression was also detected in the outer zones on sinus endothelial cells characterized by their expression of the lymphatic endothelial markers LYVE- 1 and CLEVER- 1.

40|$|Summary. -Morphological {{changes are}} {{described}} in pelvic lymph nodes excised 10 days after C. parvum (CP) treatment of patients with cervical carcinoma. Guineapig popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were investigated from Days 1 to 10 after an injection of 70,ug CP into the footpad. Eosinophils were detected from the first few hours after stimulation, initially in the marginal sinus, then in the medullary sinuses and subsequently in the efferent lymphatics. From Day 2 to Day 6, histiocyte accumulations {{with the appearance of}} epithelioid cells were found mainly in subcapsular and interfollicular areas, and small granulomas were also seen in the <b>paracortex.</b> The granuloma formation in the lymph node was considered as an indication of the activation of histiocytes. Besides small granulomas in the <b>paracortex,</b> activated interdigitating cells, surrounded by scattered lymphoblasts and eosinophils, were also present.

40|$|Lymphoid tissue immunopathology is a {{characteristic}} feature of chronic HIV/SIV infection in AIDS-susceptible species, but is absent in SIV-infected natural hosts. To investigate {{factors contributing to}} this difference, we compared germinal center development and SIV RNA distribution in peripheral lymph nodes during primary SIV infection of the natural host sooty mangabey and the non-natural host pig-tailed macaque. Although SIV-infected cells were detected in the lymph node of both species at two weeks post infection, they were confined to the lymph node <b>paracortex</b> in immune-competent mangabeys but were seen in both the <b>paracortex</b> and the germinal center of SIV-infected macaques. By six weeks post infection, SIV-infected cells were no longer detected in the lymph node of sooty mangabeys. The difference in localization and rate of disappearance of SIV-infected cells between the two species was associated with trapping of cell-free virus on follicular dendritic cells and higher numbers of germinal center CD 4 (+) T lymphocytes in macaques post SIV infection. Our data suggests that fundamental differences in the germinal center microenvironment prevent productive SIV infection within the lymph node germinal centers of natural hosts contributing to sustained immune competency...|$|E
40|$|Agent-based {{simulation}} is {{a powerful}} method for investigating the complex interplay of the processes occurring in a lymph node during an adaptive immune response. We have previously established an agent-based modeling framework for the interactions between T cells and dendritic cells within the <b>paracortex</b> of lymph nodes. This model simulates in three dimensions the "random-walk" T cell motility observed in vivo, so that cells interact {{in space and time}} as they process signals and commit to action such as proliferation. On-lattice treatment of cell motility allows large numbers of densely packed cells to be simulated, so that the low frequency of T cells capable of responding to a single antigen can be dealt with realistically. In this paper we build on this model by incorporating new numerical methods to address the crucial processes of T cell ingress and egress, and chemotaxis, within the lymph node. These methods enable simulation of the dramatic expansion and contraction of the T cell population in the lymph node <b>paracortex</b> during an immune response. They also provide a novel probabilistic method to simulate chemotaxis that will be generally useful in simulating other biological processes in which chemotaxis is an important feature...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of an immune response critically relies on the encounter of rare antigen (Ag) -specific T cells with dendritic cells (DCs) presenting the relevant Ag. How two rare cells find {{each other in the}} midst of irrelevant other cells in lymph nodes (LNs) is unknown. Here we show that initial T cell activation clusters are generated near high endothelial venules (HEVs) in the outer <b>paracortex</b> of draining LNs by retention of Ag-specific T cells as they exit from HEVs. We further show that tissue-derived DCs preferentially home in the vicinity of HEVs, thus defining the site of cluster generation. At this location DCs efficiently scan all incoming T cells and selectively retain those specific for the major histocompatibility complex–peptide complexes the DCs present. Such strategic positioning of DCs on the entry route of T cells into the <b>paracortex</b> may foster T cell–DC encounter and thus optimize initial T cell activation in vivo.

40|$|The {{lymph node}} <b>paracortex</b> is {{composed}} {{of a network of}} fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC) and reticular fibers linking sinuses to blood vessels. Using immunostaining for the inducible enzyme/adhesion molecule tissue transglutaminase (TG), we demonstrate coordinate regulation of multiple stromal cell types of this reticular network including FRC, endothelial cells and sinus lining cells. Tissue transglutaminase is expressed at low levels in the <b>paracortex</b> around primary follicles but is markedly up-regulated in stromal cells around hyperplastic germinal centers and then down-regulated around regressing follicles. In cultured FRC, TG is induced 5 - to 20 -fold and becomes colocalized with matrix proteins by treatment with interleukin- 4, but not by other cytokines that are commonly increased in lymph upon immune activation. Coordinate TG up-regulation is observed surrounding nodules of follicular lymphoma (14 of 15 cases) and in the FRC and endothelium of classical Hodgkin’s disease, two tumor types that also showed an activated paracortical phenotype. Small lymphocytic lymphoma showed minimal TG staining, with other lymphoma types showing patterns suggesting differential TG regulation. Using TG as a stromal marker, we have identified differential modulation of the phenotype of the lymph node reticular network that parallels change in the B-cell compartment...|$|E

Objectives: We studied dendritic cell (DC) subsets in the dermatopathic lymphadenitis of MF patients. Methods: We immunohistochemically examined DC subsets and their distribution in 16 LN samples from 14 patients with MF (N 1 LN, eight patients; N 2, four; and N 3, four), and we compared them with non-metastatic sentinel LNs from eight patients with melanoma. Results: The number of S- 100 protein+ DCs was markedly increased in the LNs from the MF patients and the major component was DC-LAMP+ mature DCs in the outer and <b>paracortex</b> areas, where DC-SIGN+ immature DCs were relatively decreased in proportion. In contrast, DC-SIGN+ cells were relatively increased in proportion compared to DC-LAMP+ cells in the medulla. Although no significant difference was observed in the proportions of CD 1 a+ or Langerin+ DCs among the N 1, N 2, and N 3 nodes, CD 163 + M 2 -type macrophages were increased in number in the N 2 and N 3 nodes.

The majority of cells in the paracortical regions were reactive with anti-T 1 and anti- T 3 antibodies, which define all mature peripheral T cells. In contrast, the majority of cells within primary follicles were unreactive with anti-T 1 and anti-T 3 antibodies, but were reactive with anti-Ia and anti- IgM antibodies. In addition, a substantial number of T 1 +, T 3 + cells were found in the germinal centers of secondary follicles on the capsular side. The vast majority of T 1 +, T 3 + cells in the <b>paracortex</b> and the follicles were reactive with anti-T 4 antibody, which defines inducer/helper T cells. Only a minority of cells in these areas were reactive with anti-T 5 and anti-T 8 antibodies, which define cytotoxic/suppressor cells. No lymphocytes were stained with anti-T 6 antibody, which reacts with a majority of thymocytes but not with peripheral T cells. Scattered cells in the <b>paracortex</b> showed staining for Ia antigen in an irregular dendritic pattern.

In HANNLA cytoplasmic spotty stain of WATM- 1 was seen in dendritic cells of the <b>paracortex.</b> Image analysis of the modified lmmunoMax indicated gradual increase of p 40 tax from HANNLA to ATLL and appeareance of the large amount of HTLV-I p 27 rex protein in the paracortical lymphocytes in HANNLA. Estimating dose of HTLV-I DNA forms by means of image analysis or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HTLV-I pX DNA and for human β-globin gene, increase of HTLV-I DNA forms in HANNLA suggested reproduction and reinfection of HTLV-I. Many LN- 3 (Ia-like antigen) -positive dendritic cells in HANNLA suggested cxogenous antigen-presenting. These findings suggested a possibility of an explosive increase of HTLV-I-infected T-cells in the <b>paracortex</b> of HANNLA through the host immunity. Follicle-lysis in HANNLA might bc the expression of disordercd B-cell differentiation in germinal centers under the regulatory T-cells loss caused by HTLV- 1 -induced apoptosis. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{monoclonal}} antibodies 25. 91 and 20. 27 define two {{lymphocyte cell}} surface antigens of sheep. 25. 91 is reactive with 60 - 80 % of lymphocytes and 98 % of thymocytes, and only stains surface immunoglobulin-negative peripheral lymphocytes. 25. 91 immuno-precipitates a 67, 000 MW protein from lymphocyte lysates under both reducing and non-reducing conditions, whereas immunoprecipitation of thymocyte lysates reveals a 67, 000, 62, 000 MW complex. The tissue distribution and molecular weight analysis reported {{here for the}} antigen recognized by 25. 91 indicate that this antigen is the sheep homologue of the human T 1 and mouse Ly 1 antigens. The monoclonal antibody 20. 27 is reactive with 80 % of thymocytes {{and the majority of}} cell surface immunoglobulin-positive peripheral blood lymphocytes (B cells), but is unreactive with peripheral blood T cells. 20 - 27 also stains Langerhans cells in skin tissue sections and large dendritic-like cells in the <b>paracortex</b> sections and large dendritic-like cells in the <b>paracortex</b> of lymph node tissue sections. Immunoperoxidase staining of thymus tissue sections with 20. 27 shows intense staining of cortical thymocytes and an absence of staining within the medulla. Molecular weight analysis of the 20. 27 antigen reveals two major bands of 46, 000 and 12, 000 MW under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. The 20. 27 antigen has properties resembling MHC class I-like antigens such as T 6 in the human and TL in the mouse...|$|E
