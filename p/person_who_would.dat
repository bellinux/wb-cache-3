5|$|The Bond of Association, {{which the}} Privy Council gave out in October 1584, may have {{originated}} in Dudley's ideas. Circulated in the country, the document's subscribers swore that, should Elizabeth be assassinated (as William the Silent {{had been a}} few months earlier), not only the killer but also the royal <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> benefit from this should be executed. Leicester's relations with James of Scotland grew closer when he gained {{the confidence of the}} King's favourite, Patrick, Master of Gray, in 1584–1585. His negotiations with the Master were the basis for the Treaty of Berwick, a defensive alliance between the two British states against European powers. In 1586 Walsingham uncovered the Babington Plot. Following the Ridolfi Plot (1571) and the Throckmorton Plot (1583), this was another scheme to assassinate Elizabeth in which Mary Stuart was involved. Following her conviction, Leicester, then in the Netherlands, vehemently urged her execution in his letters; he despaired of Elizabeth's security after so many plots.|$|E
5|$|Shapiro {{responds}} to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see welfare state) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by {{a refusal to}} accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn {{to family and friends}} for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility for their lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> be no worse off if they refused to work. As unconditional welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable {{to determine whether or not}} people are willing to take responsibility for their lives.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} be given refugee status the person must have applied for asylum. This person was then, whilst waiting for a decision, an asylum seeker. However, a {{displaced}} <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> legally be entitled to refugee status may never apply for asylum, {{or may not be}} allowed to apply in the country they fled to and thus not be an asylum seeker.|$|E
25|$|Jean II. de Forcade. Most of the {{difficulty}} {{for all of the}} various family branches, as highlighted by authors of books on the topic of noble genealogies, results from this <b>person,</b> <b>who,</b> <b>would</b> have been born between 1500 and 1525, but by some accounts was still alive in 1639. Facts resulting from 21st-century research indicate that this is not one person, but instead two, a father and son with the same name.|$|E

As a part of this programme, the Balloon Factory at Farnborough was to be removed from the military and placed under civilian scientific administration. In October 1909 O'Gorman was appointed as the first civilian Superintendent of the Balloon Factory. He replaced Col.

25|$|A {{crossing}} sweeper was a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> sweep a path {{ahead of}} people crossing dirty urban streets {{in exchange for}} a gratuity. This practice was an informal occupation among the urban poor, primarily during the 19th century. It was the focus of fairly intense study and commentary, and attitudes toward the presence of crossing sweepers on city streets varied greatly among urban residents, ranging from appreciation for their work to feelings that they were a public nuisance. Crossing sweepers also found their way into 19th-century fiction and artwork, including a novel by Charles Dickens and a popular painting by William Powell Frith.|$|E
25|$|The <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> {{later become}} known as El Oriental was born on December 6, 1972 son of Mexican luchador and wrestling {{promoter}} Alfonso Moreno. Later on Moreno along with Dr. Wagner and Blue Panther trained El Oriental for his professional wrestling career. He made his debut on October 23, 1992 in Arena Azteca Budokan, the arena his father operated at the time. El Oriental adopted the ring name upon making his debut and has competed exclusively under that name since then. Early in his career he worked mainly in or around {{his home state of}} Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl, Mexico State, often working with his sisters Cynthia, Rossy and Esther Moreno.|$|E
25|$|The {{colony of}} Surinam began {{importing}} {{slaves in the}} 1650s, since there were not enough indentured servants coming from England for the labour-intensive sugar cane production. In 1662, the Duke of York got a commission to supply 3,000 slaves to the Caribbean, and Lord Willoughby was also a slave trader. For the most part, English slavers dealt with slave-takers in Africa and rarely captured slaves themselves. The story of Oroonoko's abduction is plausible, for such raids did take place, but English slave traders avoided them where possible for fear of accidentally capturing a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> anger the friendly groups on the coast. Most of the slaves came from the Gold Coast, and in particular from modern-day Ghana.|$|E

25|$|On 16 January 2012, {{eight months}} after being {{diagnosed}} with cancer, Sigursteinn died at the National University Hospital in Reykjavík {{at the age of}} 43. He was survived by his wife and children. His funeral took place at the Hallgrímskirkja, the largest church in Iceland, on 26 January 2012. Following his death, many Icelandic football players and managers paid tribute to him. Leiknir midfielder Óttar Bjarni Guðmundsson described him as a great coach and a magnificent <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> always help his players. Sigursteinn's manager during his second spell with KR, Willum Þór Þórsson, paid tribute to his positive attitude as a player and praised his leadership abilities, while his former ÍA and Iceland team-mate Ólafur Adolfsson described him as a popular man who always put the interests of the team above his own.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Anthony Lapalla, a {{psychologist}} at the Federal Correctional Institution in Texarkana, believed the killer was planning to continue to make unexpected attacks such as that of Virgil Starks on the outskirts of town. He also believed that the same person committed the murders of Virgil Starks, Betty Jo Booker, Paul Martin, Polly Ann Moore and Richard Griffin. He also believed the killer was between the ages of middle 30s to 50 years old. He said that the killer was apparently motivated by a strong sex drive and that he was a sadist. He said that a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> commit such crimes is intelligent, clever, shrewd and often not apprehended. According to Lapalla's theories, the killer knew at all times what was being done in the investigation and knew that the lonesome roads were being patrolled, which is why he chose the house on the farmland. He pointed out that his statements were surmised theories that were based on {{a large number of people}} who have committed similar crimes. He said in many cases the killer is never apprehended and in some instances he will divert attention to other distant communities where it is believed the crimes are committed by a different individual or else he will overcome the desire to kill and assault women.|$|E

500|$|After this {{stint as}} an instructor, Bolt {{and his wife}} moved to New Smyrna Beach, a place {{both of them had}} enjoyed in their childhoods.

500|$|Ruiz {{experimented with}} drawing the whole series {{in a more}} {{realistic}} manner, but from the beginning {{the plan was to}} use the traditional Archie style for the book. The editorial team felt this would make the story feel more [...] "bizarre and unsettling".

500|$|Brubaker {{wanted to}} examine the reality of being a vigilante, and Kill or Be Killed focuses on the ramifications of {{violence}} {{and its effect on}} the Dylan’s loved ones.

[...] Although Dylan becomes a murderer {{at the beginning of the}} story, Brubaker hopes the character's plight is sympathetic enough that readers will root for him. Dylan's arrangement with the demon has been interpreted as commentary on the War on Terror and the racially motivated violence publicised in the US in the two years prior to the book's publication.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s, the {{majority}} of Councils decided to organise a Confederation of Civic Councils. This gave the individual Councils more muscle power.

500|$|Fingeroth {{also argues}} that a major theme in the film is fear, which {{supports}} the story of Bruce Wayne becoming a hero. Director Christopher Nolan stated that the idea behind the film was [...] "a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> confront his innermost fear and then attempt to become it". Fingeroth referred to this film's depiction as [...] "the man with fear—but who rises above it". The theme of fear is further personified by the Scarecrow. The film depicts how fear can affect all creatures regardless of might. Allusions to fear are seen throughout, from Bruce's conquering of his demons, to becoming Batman, to the Scarecrow and his deadly fear toxin. The macabre, distorted images presented in the Scarecrow's toxin-induced hallucinations also express the idea of terror to an extreme.|$|E
500|$|The {{author was}} further {{prompted}} {{to write about}} grace when a friend told him about encountering a homeless prostitute in Chicago who began to cry as {{she told him that}} she had raised money for drugs by prostituting her two-year-old child. When Yancey's friend asked the woman if she had sought help at a local church, she answered, [...] "Church? Why would I ever go there? I was already feeling terrible about myself. They'd just make me feel worse." [...] This story convinced Yancey that Christians are doing a poor job of communicating the message that God is willing to accept people, regardless of what they have done; the story haunted him, he said, because the woman was [...] "the type of <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> have gone to Jesus. The more unrighteous a person was, the more comfortable they felt around Jesus".|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs {{was more}} negative, giving the episode a C− rating and criticizing the two plots {{and the lack}} of good jokes. He wrote that while there was [...] "some comic potential" [...] in the premise, the writers failed to deliver funny material. Commenting on the plot with Homer and Roz, Childs {{explained}} that [...] "there’s some comic possibility and resonance in having Homer stabbed in the back at work. Many people have been stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer {{may not be the best}} character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee who deserves to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story. Yes, that is the sort of <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> stab someone in the back for their own gain, but yes, Homer also had it coming. Where is the joke?" ...|$|E
