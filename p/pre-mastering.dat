40|$|This paper {{considers}} the important practicality, scientific and methodological principles {{in the design}} of the <b>pre-masters</b> program in National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University (or simply TPU). TPU is a university that mainly provides technical education, particularly education in engineering, science and technology disciplines. The design of the <b>pre-masters</b> program also {{considers the}} incorporation of educational technology for its realization for the international students, who received the bachelor's degrees in other countries in English language and want to study masters programs in Russian language in Russia. According to the results of a comparative analysis that explored the experiences of the international students from English-speaking and Russian-speaking universities in the world within their pre-bachelors and <b>pre-masters</b> programs, this paper explains the differences between these programs and the specific features of the <b>pre-masters</b> programs. Further, this paper reports the analysis results of the implementation, monitoring and outcomes of the <b>pre-masters</b> program in TPU. It also presents some proposals for its further development...|$|R

50|$|Many CD replicators now accept regular CD-R discs {{in place}} of true PMCDs, which can be created using {{specialized}} Audio CD <b>pre-mastering</b> software. Unfortunately, CD-Rs formatted as “Audio CDs,” which really are Red Book-formatted Orange Book discs, are not designed for disc replication, only content distribution. The CIRC error correction used for the audio data on these discs is not as extensive as {{what is used for}} CD-ROM or DVD formats so, corruption of the audio data during readout due to dirt or mechanical damage could result in total loss of the audio data. Modern, professional <b>pre-mastering</b> software relies on the DDP format, which protects both the audio data and its associated metadata.|$|E

50|$|Jukeboxes {{typically}} contain internal SCSI or SATA based recordable drives (CD-ROM, CD-R, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD-RAM, UDO or Blu-ray) {{that connect}} {{directly to a}} file server and are managed by a third party jukebox management software. This software controls the movement of media within the jukebox, and the <b>pre-mastering</b> of data prior to the recording process.|$|E
50|$|Write-once media such as DVD-R and CD-R have {{limitations}} when {{being written}} to, in that each physical block {{can only be}} written to once, and the writing must happen incrementally. Thus the plain build of UDF can only be written to CD-Rs by <b>pre-mastering</b> the data and then writing all data in one piece to the media, {{similar to the way}} an ISO 9660 file system gets written to CD media.|$|E
50|$|July 2015 saw {{the release}} of the album 'The Art of Peace - Songs for Tibet II'. It was created to {{celebrate}} the 80th birthday of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and to promote his vision of compassion, non-violence and peace. The album features songs by various artists who donated previously unreleased material or alternative versions of songs to the project. The album was curated by music producer Rupert Hine, and the tracks were coordinated by Stephen, who was responsible for cleaning up, <b>pre-mastering</b> and sequencing the material. Stephen mixed ‘The Book of My Life (Ostinato Mix)’ by Sting, ‘Mother Within (Ostinato Mix)’ by Beyond (feat. Tina Turner, Regula Curti, Dechen Shak-Dagsay & Sawani Shende-Sathaye) and ‘You Can’t Be Chased (Ostinato Mix)’ by Rupert Hine. He also created the ‘Remastered Shimmer’ treatment for ‘Wild Man’ by Kate Bush. The album also features contributions by Lorde, Of Monsters and Men, The Crystal Method (feat. Meiko), Howard Jones, Bob Geldof, Elbow, The Family Crest, Duncan Sheik, Eleanor McEvoy, Ed Prosek, Rival Sons and Peter Gabriel.|$|E

5000|$|The {{project was}} stored on adapted laserdiscs in the LaserVision Read Only Memory (LV-ROM) format, which {{contained}} not only analogue video and still pictures, but also digital data, with 300 MB of storage space {{on each side}} of the disc. Data and images were selected and collated by the BBC Domesday project based in Bilton House in West Ealing. <b>Pre-mastering</b> of data was carried out on a VAX-11/750 mini-computer, assisted by a network of BBC micros. The discs were mastered, produced, and tested by the Philips Laservision factory in Blackburn, England. Viewing the discs required an Acorn BBC Master expanded with a SCSI controller and an additional coprocessor controlled Philips VP415 [...] "Domesday Player", a specially produced laserdisc player. The user interface consisted of the BBC Master's keyboard and a trackball (known at the time as a trackerball). The software for the project was written in BCPL (a precursor to C), to make cross platform porting easier, although BCPL never attained the popularity that its early promise suggested it might.|$|E
