5|$|After {{over an hour}} {{behind the}} safety car, the field was {{released}} to race one last time with only twelve minutes remaining. With no close contests between the competitors, the field continued to run at less than racing pace, {{in preparation for the}} finish. The No. 8 Peugeot of Sébastien Bourdais briefly went into the pits, before returning to the track. To ensure that the Peugeot finished the race, and did not break down before crossing the finishing line behind the winner, Bourdais stopped at the Ford Chicanes on the final lap. Once the No. 1 Audi had gone past to take the checkered flag, Bourdais restarted the Peugeot and finished as well. The No. 16 Pescarolo finished the race in third, the highest placed <b>petrol</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Sentinel was {{designed}} to mount either a QF 2 pounder or a QF 6 pdr (57mm, 2.25 in). However as the production order for 6 pounder tank guns had not been acted on, none of these were available and the first 65 tanks were built with the 2 pounder. Two Vickers machine guns were carried as secondary armament, one in the hull and a second mounted coaxially beside the main gun. [...] The preferred engines suitable to power a 28 tonne tank, a Pratt & Whitney Wasp single row petrol radial, or a Guiberson diesel radial, were not available within Australia, so the Sentinel was powered by the combined output of three Cadillac 346 in³ (5.7 L) V8 <b>petrol</b> <b>car</b> engines installed in clover-leaf configuration (two engines side-by-side {{to the front and}} a single to the rear: all three feeding a common gearbox).

On the other hand, diesel cars emit significantly less CO 2 km− 1 because of their lower fuel consumption than <b>petrol</b> <b>cars.</b> Therefore, according to criteria {{used to assess the}} impact on the environment (gas and particulate emissions, noise), there would be no reason for taxing differently diesel fuel and petrol consumed by passenger vehicles.
