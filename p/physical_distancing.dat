50|$|A {{series of}} {{examinations}} of language sought to find {{if there was}} a direct relation between homophobic epithets and social cognitive distancing towards a group of homosexuals, a form of dehumanization. These epithets (e.g., faggot) were thought to function as dehumanizing labels because of their tendency to act as labels of deviance. In both studies, subjects were shown a homophobic epithet, its labelled category, or unspecific insult. Subjects were later prompted to associate words of animal and human connotations to both heterosexuals and homosexuals. The results found that the malignant language, when compared to the unspecific insult and categorized labels, subjects would not connect the human connotative words with homosexuals. Further, the same assessment was done to measure effects the language may have on the <b>physical</b> <b>distancing</b> between the subject and homosexuals.Similarly to the prior associative language study, it was found that subjects became more physically distant to the homosexual, indicating the malignant language could encourage dehumanization, cognitive and <b>physical</b> <b>distancing</b> in ways that other forms of malignant language does not.|$|E

Like the coexistence of private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity has been seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments. This relationship between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is also present in the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry Us. From the outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical relationship between image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the Land Rover winding its way through the mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films. Michael J. Anderson has argued that such a thematic application of presence without presence manipulates our perception of nature and space in the geographical framework in which the world is portrayed. Kiarostami's use of sound and imagery conveys a world beyond what is directly visible and/or audible, which Anderson believes emphasises the shrinking of time and space and the interconnectedness of the modern world.|$|E

40|$|A rise in unvaccinated {{children}} and subsequent uptick in vaccine-preventable disease {{has led to}} a vigorous public debate regarding vaccination status, with some physicians and parents calling for unvaccinated children to be banned from clinics or schools. We simulated a mumps outbreak in a small school system and evaluated how key disease dynamics were impacted by instituting a policy of separating vaccinated and unvaccinated children into different schools. In addition, we evaluated the impact of school separation when used concurrently with <b>physical</b> <b>distancing,</b> self-isolation, school closure, and mandatory isolation. We used Agent Based Simulation to model mumps outbreaks among students in a small city. Agents move between the school, home and other places on a daily basis. Mumps parameters are modeled based on current literature on infectious diseases. Multiple control strategies were investigated in terms of infection rate, outbreak length, and total costs. Our motivation for this work was to evaluate the disease impact of a school separation strategy. Given the potential ethical and legal complications, the associated health benefits would have to be significant to persuade policy makers to adopt such a policy. Our results do not suggest that a school separation strategy should be adopted in most of the scenarios since this strategy increases the number of infected students, the chance of outbreaks, and the associated cost in the majority of them. In addition, our work demonstrates that educating students on the benefits of adopting <b>physical</b> <b>distancing</b> and self-isolation is effective in controlling the mumps outbreak size and cost in a population with 90...|$|E

This project adopts a case study approach and simultaneously tests for propinquity and homophily effects on neighborhood ties by employing a full-network sample from a recently-developed New Urbanist neighborhood within a mid-sized southern city. The authors find that <b>physical</b> <b>distance</b> reduces the likelihood of weak or strong ties forming, suggesting the importance of accounting for propinquity when estimating social tie formation. The authors simultaneously find that social distance along wealth reduces the likelihood of weak ties forming. Social distance on life course markers—age, marital status, and the presence of children—reduces the formation of weak ties. Consistent with the systemic model, each additional month of shared residence in the neighborhood increases both weak and strong ties.

40|$|Increasing {{environmental}} awareness {{has made it}} necessary to plan new civil engineering projects according to sustainable development criteria. As regards the more specific case of transport infrastructures, the major environmental impact of roads is, undoubtedly, that caused by traffic noise. Obviously, the simple <b>physical</b> <b>distancing</b> of the sensitive receptors most exposed to the sources of noise is in itself a sure method of self-mitigation. However, {{it is clear that}} the hypothesis of direct <b>physical</b> <b>distancing</b> between source and receptors is impractical both for economic reasons (costs of expropriation) and the scantiness of non-urbanised territories bordering with the infrastructures. Any analysis of the phenomenon of acoustic impact must also include discussion on the need to extend the width of the strip pertaining to road noise, which is currently on the agendas of governments in Europe and other parts of the world. In Italy, for example, a recent government decree has laid down the widths of noise-abatement strips (varying from 250 m for major extra-urban roads and motorways, to 30 m for urban and local roads), extending the width of the limit of the true territorial impact of transport infrastructures. Therefore, the aim in the near future must be to project road infrastructures with “euphonic characteristics”, acting both on road geometry (sections in a natural or artificial cutting, tunnels, etc.) and materials (eco-technical, sound-absorbing, euphonic pavements, etc.). The goal may be more easily reached once the roadside strips are included within the concept of “road”, with the potential to mitigate the environmental impact of the infrastructure itself. A “widened road system” can be reasonably referred to, no longer means just the roadway but also strips of land of an adequate width on either side of the infrastructure, with truly self-mitigating characteristics with respect to the local environmental context. This discussion also covers the debate on the renewal of anti-noise systems for road infrastructures, specifically oriented towards minimising the environmental impact of the actual noise abatement systems and aimed at systematically increasing the sustainability of the new transport infrastructures during the preliminary project level...|$|E

40|$|To {{seamlessly}} integrate {{into the}} human physical and social environment, robots must display appropriate proxemic behavior—that is, follow societal norms in establishing their physical and psychological distancing with people. Socialscientific theories suggest competing models of human proxemic behavior, but all conclude that individuals ’ proxemic behavior is shaped by the proxemic behavior of others and the individual’s psychological closeness to them. The present study explores whether these models can also explain how people physically and psychologically distance themselves from robots and suggest guidelines for future design of proxemic behaviors for robots. In a controlled laboratory experiment, participants interacted with Wakamaru to perform two tasks that examined physical and psychological distancing of the participants. We manipulated the likeability (likeable/dislikeable) and gaze behavior (mutual gaze/averted gaze) of the robot.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the first known}} human-subject study of comfortable approach distance and height for human interaction with a small unmanned aerial vehicle (sUAV), finding no conclusive difference in comfort with a sUAV approaching a human at above head height or below head height. Understanding the amount, if any, of discomfort introduced by a sUAV flying {{in close proximity to}} a human is critical for law enforcement, crowd control, entertainment, or flying personal assistants. Previous work has focused on how humans interact with each other or with unmanned ground vehicles, and the experimental methods typically rely on the human participant to consciously express distress. The approach taken was to duplicate the experimental set up in human proxemics studies, while adding psychophysiological sensing, under the hypothesis that human-robot interaction will mirror human-human interaction. The 16 participant, within-subjects experiment did not confirm this hypothesis. Instead a sUAV above height of a “tall” person in human experiments (2. 13 m) did not produce statistically different heart rate variability nor cause the participant to stop the robot further away than for a sUAV at a “short” height (1. 52 m). The lack of effect may be due to two possible confounds: i) duplicating prior human proxemics experiments did not capture how a sUAV would likely move or interact and ii) telling the participants that the robot could not hurt them. Despite possible confounding, the results raise the question of whether human-human psychological and <b>physical</b> <b>distancing</b> behavior transfers to human-aerial robot interactions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPhysical {{proximity}} {{between each}} pair of genomic loci in a nucleus is measured {{as a form of}} contact frequency in chromosome conformation capture-based methods. Complexity of chromosome structure in interphase can be characterized by measuring a statistical property of <b>physical</b> <b>distance</b> between genomic loci according to genomic separation along single chromatids. To find a relationship between the <b>physical</b> <b>distance</b> and the contact frequency, we propose a polymer model derived from the Langevin equation. The model is derived by considering a structure of a chromosome as a trajectory of a particle, where each consecutive segment in the chromosome corresponds to a transient position in the trajectory over time. Using chromosome conformation capture data, we demonstrate the functional relationship between the two quantities. The <b>physical</b> <b>distances</b> derived from the mean contact frequencies by the model show a good correlation with those from experimental data. From the model, we present that the mean contact frequency curve can be divided into three components that arise from different physical origins and show that the contact frequency is proportional to the contact surface area, not to the volume of segments suggested by the fractal globule model. The model explains both a decaying pattern of the contact frequency and the biphasic relationship between the <b>physical</b> <b>distance</b> and the genomic length...|$|R
