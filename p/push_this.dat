5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} dense cirrus at their tops. As the {{cumulonimbus}} cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze {{when the air}} temperature reaches the freezing point. The anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly <b>push</b> <b>this</b> dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers.|$|E
25|$|Then almost, but {{not quite}} {{simultaneously}} (to ensure separate neural recognition), you touch the undersurface of the hand (wrist) so gently that it barely suggests an upward <b>push.</b> <b>This</b> {{is followed by a}} similar utterly slight downward touch, and then I sever contact so gently that the subject does not know exactly when - and the subject's hand is left going neither up nor down, but cataleptic.|$|E
25|$|The push {{pushes the}} palm {{backward}} {{through the water}} underneath the body {{at the beginning and}} {{at the side of the}} body at the end of the push. The swimmer only pushes the arms 1/3 of the way to the hips, making it easier to enter into the recovery and making the recovery shorter and making the breathing window shorter. The movement increases speed throughout the pull-push phase until the hand is the fastest at the end of the <b>push.</b> <b>This</b> step is called the release and is crucial for the recovery. The speed at the end of the push is used to help with the recovery.|$|E

25|$|Paddle down: A type of stance by the goaltender {{when the}} play {{is coming from the}} corner {{to the front of the}} net and the puck carrier is {{carrying}} the puck in front of the net looking to score. Here the goaltender puts the stick down on the ground, parallel to the ice, with the leg farthest from the post down and the other up and ready to <b>push.</b> <b>This</b> works well against angled rushes or wrap arounds where the skater would normally out–skate the goalie. The skater does have the top part of the net to shoot at, but it is difficult to lift the puck over the goalie from up close. The paddle down stance is also effective against low passes from behind the net to players looking to score from the slot.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation Zune 16 and 120 {{devices were}} {{released}} in September 2008, {{coinciding with the}} release of the Zune Software 3.0 update. The only changes to this generation of devices were to the firmware, which was made available for all previous models, and the storage capacity. Included in this firmware update was the ability to tag and later purchase songs heard on FM radio, channels which can be customized to deliver suggested songs for the user, the games Hexic and Texas Hold' em, support for audiobooks from online stores such as Audible.com and others that support OverDrive media files, a clock, and changed quicklist functionality. The ability to purchase songs from Zune Marketplace on the device while connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi was also introduced. To help <b>push</b> <b>this</b> feature, Microsoft partnered with Wayport to allow Zune devices to access its network of over 10,000 wireless hotspots, including those at McDonald's restaurants.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} photography, Brodovitch had a {{distinct}} {{feel for what}} the magazine needed. He favored on-location fashion photography {{as opposed to the}} studio shots normally used in other fashion publications. He urged his photographers to look for jarring juxtapositions in their images. One such spread features a woman in a full-length Dior gown posed between two circus elephants. The cinematic effect, a trademark characteristic of his layouts, involved using photographs as if they were stills from a film. He would repeat a pose or a dress several times across a spread to give a narrative, temporal feeling. At times, Brodovitch would arbitrarily take a series of photographs and adopt a story line to go with them, as though recapping a movie. He was known to <b>push</b> <b>this</b> idea even further by adding film sprocket borders to photographs at times. Brodovitch also often emphasized spatial illusions, using type and photographs to create multiple perspectives within a space. The notion of mirroring and doubling also interested him, {{as can be seen in}} how he paired similar pictures on a spread or dividing halves of one image across the gutter of the page.|$|E

25|$|In 1795 in {{result of}} the Third Partition of Poland, Volhynia {{became a part of}} the Russian Empire. Although a {{reversion}} of Greek Catholics to Russian Orthodoxy began, the Russian Imperial authorities did not immediately <b>push</b> <b>this</b> to confiscate the property of those who chose not to do so. Moreover, the typography and religious schools in the monastery continued to use Latin whilst the main language of communication was Polish. Nevertheless, the first Russophilic tendencies demonstrated themselves at that time. Within thirty years of the division of Poland, the Orthodox Bishop of Volhynia, Stephan wrote to Emperor Alexander I seeking to have the Pochayiv Monastery turned over to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1823, but his request was initially overruled. However it was only nine years later, in 1831, after the Greek-Catholic support for the November Uprising, that Nicholas I of Russia ordered the cloister be given to the adherents of the Russian Orthodox Church; the monastery was reconsecrated as an Orthodox entity uner the communion of the Moscovite Patriarchy on 10 October of that year (thereby ending 110 years of Greek-Catholic monastic life).|$|E
500|$|Part II, [...] "Administration", however, {{was more}} contentious. Haig was {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} an entirely new system, where the manual would cover the whole organisation of a field army, including base and lines-of-communication troops as well as field units. This was strongly opposed by the Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General staff, who {{felt that it was}} unnecessary, and resented such an imposition on their 'territory' by what they saw as an outsider. However, with Haldane's support, Haig was able to <b>push</b> <b>this</b> through and ensure its adoption.|$|E

It was viewed by 19.10 million people. This episode was broadcast out of order in the series' production schedule as once the producers of the show knew {{that they would be}} moving to Sundays starting with the fourth episode of the season, they decided to <b>push</b> <b>this</b> episode back, feeling that it would be an excellent representative of the show for its first Sunday night episode and a better representative than the fourth episode of the season filmed, [...] "Teliko".|$|E

500|$|The album's earlier {{sessions}} {{produced a}} little material {{that has made}} the final cut. West had brought a majority of his usual production crew onto the project, the same crew that had assisted in the creation of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. One of the main exceptions was producer No I.D., who felt that the two artists weren't pushing forward enough with the music. In an interview with Complex, No I.D. commented about the project that [...] "you're going to sell, because you're already big. But you guys are important to <b>push</b> <b>this</b> forward. Push intelligence and decadence and all of the above forward in a creative manner." [...] While his advice was acknowledged to a degree, he ultimately had very little part in the finished project. In January 2011, they regrouped and rented a block of rooms at the Mercer Hotel in New York City and invited a select group of producers and recording artists. Chauncey [...] "Hit-Boy" [...] Hollis, who produced the track [...] "Niggas in Paris", said of recording at the hotel, [...] "There was music going on in every room. I had a room where I was cranking out beats, and then I'd go into the main room with Jay and [...] and play beats for them. Kanye is really hands-on. I would come in with a beat and he'd be like, 'Take this out, slow it down.' It would make it sound 100 times better. Jay would then mumble different flows to the beat".|$|E
500|$|In 2005 {{all of the}} Brazos Junior members took on a new name, {{creating}} their own identity in Lucha Libre. Felipe Alvarado took the enmascarado (masked character) [...] "La Máscara" [...] ("The Mask"). In May 2005, {{he won his first}} major championship when he defeated Doctor X for the Mexican National Welterweight Championship. He held the title for over a year, before he lost the belt to Sangre Azteca on December 17, 2006. Earlier that year, he lost to Hajime Ohara in a match for the then vacant NWA World Welterweight Championship in Mexico City. La Máscara has been pushed strongly since changing to that gimmick (from Brazo de Oro Jr.), with some thought that it might be due to his family connections. His work has appeared to catch up with his <b>push</b> <b>this</b> year, and he's a solid high flier. On June 13, 2008, La Máscara teamed with Héctor Garza and El Hijo del Fantasma in a tournament for the vacant CMLL World Trios Championship and won the titles after beating Blue Panther, Dos Caras, Jr. and Místico in the finals. The three held the titles for over seven weeks until they lost it to Último Guerrero, Negro Casas and Atlantis on August 5. La Máscara and his partners regained the titles on a show in Guadalajara on January 18, 2009. On January 29, 2010 La Máscara teamed up with Negro Casas to participate in CMLL's [...] "Torneo Nacional de Pareja Increíbles" [...] ("National Amazing Pairs tournament"), a tournament where CMLL teams up a Tecnico (La Máscara) and a Rudo (Casas) for a tournament. The two defeated El Texano, Jr. and Rouge in the opening round, El Sagrado and Shocker in the second round and Héctor Garza and Toscano in the semi-final to earn a spot in the final of the tournament. On February 5, 2010 Casas and La Máscara lost to Máscara Dorada and Atlantis in the finals.|$|E

2500|$|Meeting for Sufferings was {{originally}} established {{to assess the}} persecution of Friends and attempt to obtain redress. Morning Meeting, a now-obsolete body of London Quakers, agreed in October 1675 to commission certain local Friends to meet {{four times a year}} for this purpose. Their efforts were mainly directed towards the suffering of imprisoned Quakers, but they also lobbied Parliament to reduce the burden of tithes and oaths. (The refusal of Friends to take oaths, based on Jesus Christ's words [...] "Swear not at all" [...] (Matthew 5:33 [...] 37), caused great difficulties with the government and courts.) Smaller weekly meetings, which continued until 1798, helped to <b>push</b> <b>this</b> process forward.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{is highly}} {{regarded}} retrospectively by some music critics, though {{others are more}} skeptical of the song.

He went on to conclude that [...] "The real dumbheads [...] were the record buying public of 1963, who could <b>push</b> <b>this</b> amazing record no higher than #50 on the US chart." [...] Vice's Mish Way spoke negatively of Arnell's version, however, commenting that when [...] "Arnell sings this song the lyrics seem pathetic and forced."

It was reasoned that the conflict could be confined only to Kashmir. In the words of retired Pakistani General Akhtar Hussain Malik, the aims were [...] "to defreeze the Kashmir problem, weaken Indian resolve, and bring India to the conference table without provoking general war." [...] As a result, groundwork and intelligence gathering for execution of the plan was laid by launching [...] "Operation Nusrat", the purpose of which was to locate gaps in the Cease Fire Line (CFL) that were to serve as entry points for the mujahideen, and to gauge the response of the Indian army and the local population.|$|E
