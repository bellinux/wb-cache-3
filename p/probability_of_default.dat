The theoretical hypothesis {{of the existence}} of a time-dependent target leverage ratio reflects the movement of a firm's initial target ratio toward a long-term target ratio over time. Using some simple scenarios about the time-dependence of the target leverage ratio, the numerical results show that the incorporation of the hypothesis into the stationary leverage- ratio model is capable of producing term structures <b>of</b> <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>default</b> that are consistent with some empirical findings reported by Standard and Poor's.

40|$|This paper elaborates on the {{validation}} requirements for rating systems and <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>default</b> (PDs) which were introduced with the New Capital Standards (Basel II). We start in Section 2 with some introductory {{remarks on the}} topics and approaches that will be discussed later on. Then we have a view on the developments in banking regulation that have enforced {{the interest of the}} public in validation techniques. When doing so, we put the main emphasis on the issues with quantitative validation. The techniques discussed here could be used {{in order to meet the}} quantitative regulatory requirements. However, their appropriateness will depend on the specific conditions under which they are applied. In order to have a common ground for the description of the different techniques, we introduce in Section 3 a theoretical framework that will be the basis for the further considerations. Intuitively, a good rating system should show higher <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>default</b> for the less creditworthy rating grades. Therefore, in Section 4, we discuss how this monotonicity property is reflected in the theoretical framework from Section 3. In Section 5, we study the meaning of discriminatory power and some tools for measuring it in some detail. We will see that there are tools that might be more appropriate than others for the purpose of regulatory validation of discriminatory power. The topic in Section 6 is calibration of rating systems. We introduce some of the tests that can be used for checking correct calibration and discuss the properties of the different tests. We then conclude in Section 7 with some comments on the question which tools might be most appropriate for quantitative validation of rating systems and <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>default.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to provide}} a {{quantitative}} methodology for dealing with (true) Knightian uncertainty {{in the management of}} credit risk based on information-gap decision theory. Design/methodology/approach – Credit risk management assigns clients to credit risk categories with estimated <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>default</b> for each category. Since <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>default</b> are subject to uncertainty the estimated expected loss given default on a loan-book can be subject to significant uncertainty. Information-gap decision theory is applied to construct optimal loan-book portfolios that are robust against uncertainty. Findings – By choosing optimal interest-rate ratios among the credit risk categories one can simultaneously satisfy regulatory requirements on expected losses and an institution's aspirations on expected profits. Research limitations/implications – In the analysis presented here only defaults over specific time frames have been considered. However, performance requirements expressed in terms <b>of</b> <b>defaults</b> and profits over multiple time frames that allow for transitions of clients between credit risk categories over time could also be incorporated into an information-gap analysis. Practical implications – An additional management analysis tool for applying information-gap modeling to credit risk has been provided. Originality/value – This paper provides a new methodology for analyzing credit risk based on information-gap decision theory.
