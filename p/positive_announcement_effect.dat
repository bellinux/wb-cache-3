40|$|An {{increasing}} number of North American companies are freezing or terminating their traditional defined benefit (DB) pension plans. In this article we document a <b>positive</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>effect</b> when a publicly traded company discloses that it has partially or fully frozen its DB plan and replaced it with-or enhanced-the 401 (k) defined contribution (DC) plan. This positive risk-adjusted return is greater for firms with higher beta and/or lower return on equity (ROE) prior to the freeze. In other words the positive impact is more pronounced for firms {{that are likely to}} face financial distress if they maintain their traditional pension plan and the associated long-term promises.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} why firms {{choose to}} pay stock dividends. Using {{a sample of}} listed Chinese firms we find that older, more profitable firms with lower leverage, higher levels of retained earnings, private ownership prior to listing, that invest more in fixed assets and operate in regions with lower shareholder protection {{are more likely to}} pay stock dividends. Consistent with stock dividends substituting for stock splits, our evidence indicates that the initiation of a stock dividend is associated with a significant positive market reaction and increased analyst following. These results suggest that firms use stock dividends to attract analysts&# 039; attention. In addition, the <b>positive</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>effect</b> for stock dividends increases with the size of the split factor, suggesting that management use stock dividends to keep the firm&# 039;s stock price within its acceptable trading range...|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} {{asserted}} that stock splits and stock dividends are purely cosmetic events. However, {{many studies have}} documented several stock market effects associated with stock splits and stock dividends. This paper examines {{the effects of these}} two types of events for the Danish stock market. Consistent with the existing literature, the two events are associated with a significantly <b>positive</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>effect</b> of ap-proximately 2. 5 %. However, when examining the two events more carefully, several important results are obtained. First, a firm's motivation for announcing the two events is completely different. Second, the positive stock market reaction is closely related to associated changes in a firm's payout policy, but the relationship varies for the two types of events. Finally, there is only very weak evidence for a change in the liquidity of the stock. On the whole, after controlling for the firm's payout policy, the results suggest that a stock split is a cosmetic event and that a stock dividend on its own is considered negative news.

40|$|We analyze a firm's {{choice between}} spin-offs, equity carve-outs, and {{tracking}} stock {{issues and the}} role of institutional investors in corporate restructuring. We model a firm with two divisions. Insiders have private information about firm value and face an equity market with retail and institutional investors. We show that restructuring increases information production by institutional investors (relative to that about the consolidated firm) : the highest increase in information production arises from spin-offs, the next highest from carve-outs, and the lowest from tracking stock issues. Insiders with the most favorable private information implement spin-offs; those with less favorable private information implement carve-outs; those with even less favorable private information implement tracking stock issues; and those with unfavorable private information remain consolidated. We explain the <b>positive</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>effect</b> and increase in analyst coverage associated with all three forms of restructuring.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of the choice between two forms of corporate divestitures⎯spin-offs versus sell-offs. We hypothesize that the choice {{is driven by the}} characteristics of divesting firms (their pre-divestiture market valuation relative to intrinsic value and marginal tax rates), the characteristics of assets being divested (their performance under parent firm’s management relative to their full potential), and by the prevailing market conditions at the time of divestiture (such as the degree of investor optimism or pessimism). Our hypotheses generate testable predictions regarding the <b>announcement</b> <b>effects</b> of divestitures and the post-divestiture operating and stock return performance of divesting firms. Our empirical findings using a sample of 322 spin-offs and 3, 280 sell-offs from 1980 to 2006 are as follows. First, firms with lower market valuations relative to their intrinsic value and higher marginal tax rates are more likely to spin off their assets. Second, assets which underperform relative to their full potential {{are more likely to be}} sold off. Third, spin-offs are more likely during periods of investor optimism. Fourth, spin-offs are associated with more <b>positive</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>effects</b> than selloffs.

40|$|By {{means of}} an event study of stock market {{reactions}} to {{the announcement of the}} Olympic Games host cities, we find a significant and <b>positive</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>effect</b> of hosting the Summer Games, with a cumulative abnormal return of about 2 % within a few days.

Our results differ from those of a similar study by Mirman and Sharma (2008), who find that the Winter Games are subject to a significantly negative announcement impact, while the Summer Games are not. Our results, however, rely on a larger sample of 15 Olympic events and are obtained by assessing the abnormal returns after the announcement against a ?business?as?usual" situation (instead of testing the difference between winner group and loser group). Our findings are in line with economic intuition, since the Summer Games represent a larger event and are thus {{more likely to have a}} significant impact.

40|$|Research on {{the impact}} of {{announcements}} of investments in enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems has so far yielded divergent results. The present study, using data on ERP system implementation announcements of 112 predominantly Fortune 350 firms during 1990 - 2010, examines the impact of ERP implementation announcements on stock returns in the United States. The empirical result shows that abnormal returns of the US firms for the event window (- 1, + 1) on ERP system implementation announcements are positive and statistically significant. Our empirical results reveal that publicly traded companies in the US generate significant reactions in the positive direction in the stock market. The reason of this <b>positive</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>effect</b> is that the market stays hopeful of larger returns for the years to come with the streamlining of business processes in line with the industry's best practices. The capital market anticipates positive net future cash flows from the use of ERP systems. ERP systems enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the firms through increasing their production flexibility and streamlining critical business processes such as sale and inventory management. Accordingly, stock market participants react positively to the announcements of ERP system implementations as is proven in this study. [...] P. ii.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{and tests}} a dynamic, sequential equilibrium model of corporate cash payout policy that endogenizes a firm's dividend initiation decision, and its extreme reluctance to subsequently cut dividends in a sequential equilibrium. After payment of dividends, all excess cash is disgorged via stock repurchases that elicit no price reactions. The theoretical model generates results consistent with many stylized facts related to dividend initiations, including: a <b>positive</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>effect</b> {{associated with a}} dividend initiation; a larger (in absolute value) negative announcement effect for a dividend cut/omission than for an initiation; and a probability of dividend initiation that is increasing in the firm's profitability and assets in place, and decreasing in the personal tax rate on dividends relative to capital gains. The model also generates additional novel predictions, {{one of which is}} that the probability of dividend initiation is decreasing in managerial ownership of the firm, and this effect is stronger the weaker is (external) corporate governance. A second novel prediction is that the dividend initiation probability is decreasing in the potential loss in value from the "two-audience-signaling" information disclosure costs associated with secondary equity issues. These new predictions are tested empirically using a predictive logit model of dividend initiations. Moreover, the paper tests and finds additional empirical support for the information-disclosure result using a regression discontinuity design. by Richard Todd Thakor. Thesis: S.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyses}} {{under which}} conditions firms may signal {{the existence of}} good investment projects by the choice of low issuance prices at rights offerings. Fundamentally to the analysis is the assumption of boundedly rational investors who are loss avers and value different components of their total wealth on different mental accounts. A separating equilibrium may be attained by the choice of type-dependent offering prices given “sufficiently ” loss avers investors. In this connection, costs of mimicking “good type ” firms would emerge for “bad type ” firms from the undershooting of an individually critical issuance price from which on the resulting price per share following the offering lies below the reference price of the incumbent shareholders. Because of loss aversion and mental accounting, the loss in utility, felt in doing so, is valued more vigorous than corresponding additional proceedings {{from the sale of}} subscription rights {{as a consequence of the}} imitation of the offering price of “better” firms so that there is indeed separating firm behaviour.

We extend the empirical research by identifying FTT announcement and short-run treatment effects, which can distort difference-in-differences estimates. In addition, we consider long-run volatility measures that better fit the French FTT's legislative design. While we find strong evidence of a <b>positive</b> FTT <b>announcement</b> <b>effect</b> on trading volumes, there is almost no statistically significant evidence of a long-run treatment effect. Thus, evidence of a strong reduction of trading volumes resulting from the French FTT might be driven by <b>announcement</b> <b>effects</b> and short-term treatment effects.

40|$|Prior studies {{discuss the}} {{relationship}} between implied volatility and expected stock returns. The existing literature shows that implied volatilities are an important risk factor affecting expected stock returns. In this paper, we use the CBOE Volatility Index, VIX, to extend the understanding of {{the relationship between}} VIX and portfolio returns. The extension includes three folds. First, we investigate the impact of the announcement of the macroeconomic news on implied volatility. The macroeconomic news includes unemployment rate, consumer price index, industrial production index, and the annual growth rate of M 2. Second, we analyze the influence of the announcements of the macroeconomic news and the implied volatility on the announcement date on expected portfolio returns. Third, we test the impact of the volatility of implied volatility on expected portfolio returns. The empirical evidence shows that the announcement of unemployment rate, industrial production index, and the annual growth rate of M 2 have significant effect on the implied volatility and expected portfolio returns, especially on the growth firms. The announcement of unemployment rate has the significantly negative announcement effect on growth firms. But the announcements of industrial production index and the annual growth rate of M 2 have significantly <b>positive</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>effect</b> on growth firms. The announcement effect of consumer price index on both implied volatility and expected portfolio returns, however, are not significant relative to other macroeconomic news. In addition, the implied volatilities on the announcement date have no significant effect on expected portfolio returns. Finally, the volatility of implied volatility has significantly negative effect on most expected portfolio returns. 過去有許多學者探討隱含波動度與股票報酬之間的關係，且研究發現隱含波動度確實可視為影響股票報酬的重要風險因子。而本文運用芝加哥選擇權交易所編製的隱含波動度指數VIX，將先前的研究再進一步延伸探討。首先討論總體經濟指標宣告對隱含波動度的影響，本文採用失業率、消費者物價指數、工業生產指數和M 2 年增率為指標性的總體變數。接著討論總體經濟指標宣告對投資組合預期報酬的影響，以及總體經濟指標宣告當日的隱含波動度對投資組合預期報酬的影響。最後再探討隱含波動度的變異性對投資組合預期報酬的影響。實證結果發現失業率、工業生產指數和M 2 年增率的宣告效果，對市場的隱含波動度和投資組合預期報酬有顯著影響，尤其對成長型公司的影響更為明顯。其中失業率宣告對成長型公司有存在顯著負向的影響，M 2 年增率宣告和工業生產指數宣告對成長型公司的預期報酬則有正向關係。消費者物價指數的宣告則較無顯著影響效果，此現象的原因可能來自於股價已反映了部分的通貨膨脹率，因此宣告效果並不顯著。然而，總體經濟指標宣告當日的隱含波動度對所有投資組合預期報酬皆無顯著影響，由此判斷宣告日的隱含波動度改變並不能顯著影響投資人對公司未來表現的預期。最後，隱含波動度的條件變異數對大部分投資組合的預期報酬有顯著負向影響，代表投資人對未來市場的預期受隱含波動度變異的影響。第一章 緒論 1 第一節 研究背景與動機 1 第二節 研究目的 3 第三節 研究架構 3 第二章 文獻回顧 5 第一節 隱含波動度與股票報酬 5 第二節 總體經濟指標與股票報酬 6 第三節 總體訊息宣告與波動性 7 第四節 VIX的編制 8 第五節 GARCH文獻 10 第三章 研究方法 12 第一節 資料來源 12 第二節 實證模型 13 第四章 實證結果分析 16 第一節 VIX與市場報酬分析 16 第二節 總體經濟指標宣告對股價報酬分析 16 第三節 VIX的變異數對股價報酬分析 26 第五章 結論與建議 29 第一節 結論 29 第二節 研究限制與建議 30 參考文獻 3...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate (1) whether the enforcement actions (EAs) against related party transaction (RPT) {{have a negative effect}} on the market reaction around announcement period, and (2) what specific factors affect the market reaction. The conjecture is driven by the agency theory regarding the opportunistic behavior via RPT. The result of the first research question is benchmarked against the market reaction for the public announcements (PAs) of RPT. The second question focuses on examining two specific factors that influence the announcement effect of RPT EAs, namely, the announcement type and the transaction type. The announcement type concerns whether the rectification action could reduce the negative announcement effect of EAs. The transaction type concerns whether the non-operating RPT yields significant announcement effect than other types do. Additionally, the market reaction for the corporate governance mechanism is discussed. It is hypothesized that the market would impose a governance discount to firms engaged in RPT. Initially 84 target firms that undertook RPT between fiscal year 2000 and 2013 are selected from EAs released from January 2008 to July 2014. The matched-pair analysis is adopted for matching firms with RPT EAs to the same number of matched-pair firms with RPT PAs on one-to-one basis. Therefore, the total sample of the thesis consists of 168 Chinese publicly traded firms. The event study methodology is employed to calculate the announcement effect which is measured by the cumulative abnormal return (CAR). Quantitative methods are applied to explore the changes of CARs in response to the different factors. The main conclusion is that the RPT EAs have a significant and negative impact on the stock returns of the target firm around announcement date. And the RPT PAs have a significant and <b>positive</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>effect.</b> Moreover, EAs that include the rectification actions have a weakly negative announcement effect. And EAs that target on non-operating RPT have a strongly negative announcement effect. In addition, firms with RPT EAs are negatively correlated with the CEO duality. This is in contrast to the firms with RPT PAs since these firms tend to be positively correlated with the CEO duality and larger board size. The difference of the market reactions for the CEO duality between two samples might arise from the investors' perception on the role that the dual CEO plays situated in different contexts...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two self-contained chapters that empirically examine bidder firm returns of U. S. companies in cross-border mergers and acquisitions. In chapter one I examine how cultural distance between bidder and target country impacts internalization benefits. The results suggest that shareholders are initially concerned about the acquisition in culturally distant countries, which outweighs any potential benefits from internalization. However, in the long-run we observe a significant reversal of these findings. In {{the second and third}} year following the announcement, greater cultural distance positively impacts the bidder firm 2 ̆ 7 s operating performance and the bidder experiences significant internalization benefits from technological know-how when cultural distance is great. Long-run calendar-time returns further support this finding. These results add to the existing literature by highlighting the importance of cultural distance when examining internalization benefits. In chapter two I attempt to explain abnormal bidder firms 2 ̆ 7 returns in cross-border mergers and acquisitions by comparing the first-mover hypothesis to the late-mover hypothesis. I also study the reactions of rival firms to bidder firm announcements as a further test of the first-mover hypothesis. The findings suggest that cross-border acquisitions are generally value-destroying for strategic pioneers unless cultural distance between the U. S. and the target country is great. Further, I find <b>positive</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>effects</b> for followers as long as cultural distance is small...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} work on mild segmentation {{suggests that}} tests of dual listing {{should be conducted}} as joint tests: a) a test of changes in market integration that may affect asset returns through investors portfolio reallocations as the choice set changes, and b) a test of changing risk premium/information effects. Previous empirical studies on common stocks {{have been unable to}} identify significant positive abnormal returns associated with international listing. However, such studies have not formally tested for changes in market integration through time. In addition, they have not examined announcement dates, which should be the focal point in testing for valuation effects. Unlike previous studies, our analysis concentrates on both the period surrounding the earliest public announcements by Canadian companies of their intentions to seek a U. S. listing for their common shares on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ as well as the date of U. S. listing during the period 1985 - 96. This period encompasses significant changes in the regulatory environment which might be perceived to enhance the integration of the two markets. Relying on a conditional asset pricing model subject to time-varying volatility, {{the results of this study}} fail to support the view that market integration has increased between the Canadian and U. S. stock markets over the 1985 - 96 period. The significantly <b>positive</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>effects</b> of Canadian stock listings in the U. S...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} a {{dark side}} of banking relationships by elucidating {{the conditions under which}} a pre-existing relationship between a lending bank and a borrower can be detrimental to positive valuation <b>effects</b> of loan <b>announcements.</b> The <b>effect</b> of a pre-existing relationship {{is more likely to be}} negative when the pre-existing loans are large and firms' screening costs are low. A theoretical model shows that loan <b>announcement's</b> <b>positive</b> <b>effect</b> on borrowers' value due to the standard information advantage can be more than offset by the bank's conflict of interest when the bank's asset quality reputation is poor, i. e. when the probability of the bank holding a bad loan is large. Conflicts of interest, banking relationships, soft-budget constraint, sequential equilibrium,...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in corporate governance. The first essay examines the effects of exogenous CEO health shocks on firm performance and corporate decisions. I build a hand-collected data set of incumbent CEO accident, illness, and disease events. The results demonstrate that CEO health shocks {{have a negative effect}} on firm performance, whether the CEO departs as a result of the event or stays with the firm. In sub-sample analysis of CEOs who continue with their careers, I find a persistent change in within-manager behavior: CEOs who experience significant health shocks adopt more conservative corporate policies. This contributes the CEO managerial style literature and provides evidence that CEO style varies across tenure. The second and third essays examine different aspects of CEO succession planning. The second essay examines the impact of CEO succession planning during CEO turnover events. To isolate the value of firm succession plans, I use the sudden death of CEOs as a natural experiment. Firms with succession plans have <b>positive</b> <b>announcement</b> <b>effects</b> and higher firm performance following the turnover event and these effects are significant economically. I find evidence that firms with succession plans are less likely to appoint COOs or interim CEOs and make appointments from a larger section of the CEO labor market. These results highlight the economic importance of CEO succession planning as part of the board’s monitoring function. The third essay examines the factors affecting the likelihood of a firm having a CEO succession plan. I document a causal relationship between director experience and firm adoption of succession plans. To examine the effects of director experience, I study directors who have multiple directorships; I use only experience acquired from other firms after the director joined the current firm. This identification accounts for selection concerns by exploiting the exogenous variation in director experience. In a series of additional tests, I find a negative association with CEO power and a positive association with peer firms and the adoption of succession plans...|$|R
