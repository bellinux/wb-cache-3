We compare the covariance measure with the measures based on the von Neumann and linear entropies of the subsystems, studying their dependences on time, coupling constants, and the initial state {{in the cases of}} parametric amplification and parametric conversion. In particular, we show that coherent states remain disentagled for all times and for any choice of coupling constants in the case of <b>parametric</b> <b>converter</b> (with accuracy up to second-order terms with respect to the strength of coupling). Also, we demonstrate that no bilinear coupling can squeeze the initial coherent state or improve the squeezing of the initial squeezed state {{in the case of a}} parametric amplifier.

40|$|We are {{developing}} a prototype of cryogenic <b>parametric</b> <b>converter</b> transducer operating at 5 GHz, for the upgrade of the ROG Collaboration resonant G. W. antennas. This device is built {{on the experience of}} the Niobe detector (D. G. Blair et al.), with substantial modifications that should let us achieve better stability and sensitivity. The prototype uses as <b>parametric</b> <b>converter</b> a superconducting coaxial cavity with a 50 micron gap (Q 0 = 5 Ã— 10 8 at 1. 5 K and 100 Î¼W RF power dissipation), and a contacless RF coupling for thermal insulation between the 2 K stage and the ultra cryogenic (100 mK) antenna. The coupler features a constant transmission loss of 0. 2 dB over a range of displacements of 5 mm in x, y and z around the nominal operating position with a separation of 8 mm between the two halves of the coupler. In this way the large, low frequency swings (0. 5 and 17 Hz), of the 2 Tons antenna around its suspension point have no influence on the transducer performance. To test all the components of the transducer and the system performance, a room temperature prototype is installed on the TART (Test Antenna at Room Temperature) facility at the INFN labs. Using critical coupling for the RF cavity input coupler we manage to keep to a minimum the leakage of the drive signal to the first RF amplifier. In this way we avoid degradation of the RF amplifier noise figure (0. 6 dB at room temperature) produced by the RF amplifier saturation Experimental results agree with the full analysis of the room temperature detector performances.

40|$|Microwave {{parametric}} amplifiers {{based on}} Josephson junctions {{have become a}} key component of many quantum information experiments. One key limitation which has not been well predicted by theory is the gain saturation behavior which determines its ability to process large amplitude signals. The typical explanation for this behavior in phase-preserving amplifiers based on three-wave mixing is pump depletion, in which the consumption of pump photons to produce amplification results in a reduction in gain. However, in this work we present experimental data and theoretical calculations showing that the fourth-order Kerr nonlinearities inherent in the Josephson junctions are the dominant factor in the Josephson <b>Parametric</b> <b>Converter</b> (JPC). The Kerr-based theory has the unusual property of causing saturation to both lower and higher gains, depending on bias conditions. This work presents a new methodology for optimizing device performance in the presence of Kerr nonlinearities while retaining device tunability, and points to the necessity of controlling higher-order Hamiltonian terms to make further improvements in parametric devices.

We show that the new design considerably simplifies the circuit and reduces the footprint of the device while maintaining a comparable performance to state-of-the-art JPCs. Furthermore, we exploit the tunable bandwidth property of the JPC and the added capability of applying alternating currents to the flux line in order to switch the resonance frequencies of the device, hence demonstrating time-multiplexed amplification of microwave tones that are separated by more than the dynamical bandwidth of the amplifier.

However, no waveguiding platforms (to our knowledge) have yet solved the trade-off among high nonlinearity, low propagation losses and dispersion in the MIR. As single waveguide designs have not yet hit this particular optimal point, only pulsed-pumped demonstrations have been carried out, hindering any application requiring narrow linewidth, continuous-wave (c. w.) operation, or signal modulation.

40|$|Cladding-pumped rare-earth-doped {{fibers and}} Raman fiber devices {{have been two}} of the most {{compelling}} advances in the area of high-power fiber amplifiers and lasers in recent years. Cladding-pumping enables pumping with multi-mode pump sources that deliver high-power at a low cost The core of the double-clad fiber can still be single-moded, so that single-mode amplification or lasing can be realized. Raman gain requires high pump powers and Raman conversion is therefore only efficient at high power levels. On the other band, Raman devices are very flexible as gain is available at arbitrary wavelengths with the right pump source. Cladding-pumped Raman fiber devices represent a natural progression to multi-mode pumping and Raman fiber devices. While cladding-pumped Raman fiber devices require pump powers of, say, 100 W, such powers are available from fiber sources as well as from traditional bulk sources. For example, a multimode Nd-doped fiber laser with 1 kW of output power was recently reported. With pulsed sources, however, the required peak powers can be achieved with relatively modest average powers. Here, we report for the first time Raman amplification in a cladding-pumped fiber, without any rare-earth doping.
