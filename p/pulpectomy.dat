5000|$|A root treated tooth may be eased {{from the}} {{occlusion}} {{as a measure}} to prevent tooth fracture prior to the cementation of a crown or similar restoration. Sometimes the dentist performs preliminary treatment of the tooth by removing all of the infected pulp of the tooth and applying a dressing and temporary filling to the tooth. This is called a <b>pulpectomy.</b> The dentist may also remove just the coronal portion of the dental pulp, which contains 90% of the nerve tissue, and leave intact the pulp in the canals. This procedure, called a [...] "pulpotomy", tends to essentially eliminate all the pain. A pulpotomy may be a relatively definitive treatment for infected primary teeth. The <b>pulpectomy</b> and pulpotomy procedures aim to eliminate pain until the follow-up visit for finishing the root canal. Further occurrences of pain could indicate the presence of continuing infection or retention of vital nerve tissue.|$|E

STUDY DESIGN : A retrospective survey of data obtained from electronic and paper records of 498 randomly selected teeth from the 1050 that had undergone EPs between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2013 at the UPOHC, followed to 30 June 2014. METHODS : The outcome of treatment was recorded as “no treatment after initial pulpectomy”, “pulpectomy repeated”, “tooth was removed” or “root canal treatment (RCT) was completed by student or dentist”. RESULTS : Of the 498 teeth included, 224 (44. 98 %) were obturated, 35 (7. 03 %) were retreated, forty two (8. 43 %) teeth were referred for extraction and 197 (39. 56 %) remained untreated.

METHODS: The study {{was carried out}} on 24 children (mean age = 6. 71 years) who had received 50 single-visit zinc oxide and eugenol (ZOE) <b>pulpectomies</b> in primary molars. The root canal filling materials were deposited into the canals either by a lentulo spiral mounted in a slow-speed handpiece or by a hand-held lentulo spiral. Evaluation of pulpectomized molars was performed by both authors immediately and 6 months following treatment using specific clinical and radiographic criteria. In cases of disagreement, the lower rank was selected. RESULTS: The study found 64 % (16 / 25) optimal filling (if 1 {{or more of the}} canals having ZOE ended at the radiographic apex or up to 2 mm short of the apex) when the lentulo spiral mounted in the slow-speed handpiece was used. It also found a 96 % (21 / 22) clinical success rate in the group obturated by the lentulo spiral mounted in a slow-speed handpiece vs 48 % (12 / 25) optimal filling and a 92 % (23 / 25) clinical success rate in the group obturated by a hand-held lentulo spiral.

40|$|After {{aggression}} to {{the dental}} pulp, some cells produce cytokines {{in order to}} start and control the inflammatory process. Among these cytokines, interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 &# 946;) and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) emerge as important ones. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze the location, distribution and concentration of these cytokines in healthy and inflamed dental pulps. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty pulps, obtained from healthy third molars (n= 10) and from <b>pulpectomies</b> (n= 10) were used for the study, with half of each group used for immunohistochemistry and half for protein extraction and ELISA assays. Fibroblasts obtained from healthy dental pulps, stimulated or not by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in order to simulate aggression on the cell cultures, were also used and analyzed by ELISA for IL- 1 &# 946; and IL- 8 as complementary information. Data obtained from immunohistochemistry were qualitatively analyzed. Data obtained from ELISA assays (tissue and cells) were statistically treated by the t-test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Immunohistochemically, it was observed that inflamed pulps were strongly stained for both cytokines in inflammatory cells, while healthy pulps were not immunolabeled. ELISA from tissues quantitatively confirmed the higher presence of both cytokines. Additionally, cultured pulp fibroblasts stimulated by LPS also produce more cytokines than the control cells. CONCLUSIONS: It may be concluded that inflamed pulps present higher amounts of IL- 1 &# 946; and IL- 8 than healthy pulps and that pulp fibroblasts stimulated by bacterial LPS produce higher levels of IL- 1 &# 946; and IL- 8 than the control group.

40|$|O sucesso do tratamento endodÃntico depende de muitos fatores, sendo a reduÃÃo ou eliminaÃÃo da infecÃÃo bacteriana o mais importante desses fatores. Portanto, o uso de substÃncias capazes de agir nesses microorganismos e em seus subprodutos torna-se uma etapa importantÃssima no tratamento. O objetivo deste ensaio clÃnico âsplit-mouthâ foi comparar a eficÃcia da clorexidina gel 1 % e do hidrÃxido de cÃlcio associado ao paramonoclorofenol canforado (Callen PMCCÂ), como medicaÃÃo intracanal, e do tratamento executado em sessÃo Ãnica (grupo controle), contra Estreptococos do grupo mutans (EGM) e bactÃrias anaerÃbias presentes no {{interior}} dos canais radiculares de molares decÃduos com necrose pulpar. Um total de 21 crianÃas (37 dentes) participou do estudo. Amostras iniciais (prÃ-tratamento) e finais (apÃs a permanÃncia das substÃncias por 14 dias no interior dos canais) foram coletadas para anÃlise microbiolÃgica e incubadas em placas de Mitis Salivarius Bacitracina, em aerofilia, para a observaÃÃo dos nÃveis de EGM, assim como em placas de Brucella Ãgar, em anaerobiose, para verificaÃÃo de bactÃrias anaerÃbias. Os nÃveis de sucesso da pulpectomia apÃs um perÃodo de acompanhamento de atÃ 12 meses foram analisados baseados em parÃmetros clÃnicos e radiogrÃficos. A clorexidina gel a 1 % reduziu significantemente os nÃveis de EGM (p= 0, 010, teste de Wilcoxon) e o Callen PMCCÂ reduziu significantemente os nÃveis de bactÃrias anaerÃbias (p= 0, 002, teste de Wilcoxon). Observou-se diferenÃa significativa na comparaÃÃo da reduÃÃo dos nÃveis de EGM obtidos pelo grupo da clorexidina e pelo controle (p= 0, 032, Mann-Whitney). A taxa de sucesso do tratamento foi de 81, 71 % no grupo do Callen PMCCÂ, 78, 57 % para o grupo da clorexidina gel 1 % e 77, 77 % no grupo controle. Concluiu-se que a clorexidina gel a 1 %, assim como o hidrÃxido de cÃlcio associado ao paramonoclorofenol canforado, possui eficÃcia limitada na reduÃÃo de bactÃrias dos canais radiculares decÃduos infectados. Os presentes resultados sugerem que uma possÃvel associaÃÃo entre as medicaÃÃes testadas em estudos futuros pode eliminar de maneira mais eficaz estas bactÃrias. The {{success of}} endodontic treatment depends on many factors, and the reduction or elimination of bacterial infection {{is the most}} important one. Therefore, the use of substances that act against these microorganisms and their products becomes an important stage in treatment. The aim of this in vivo split-mouth study was to compare the efficacy of a 1 % chlorhexidine gel, calcium hydroxide/camphorated paramonochlorophenol (Callen PMCCÂ) as intracanal medications, and a Control group (1 -visit endodontic treatment) against mutans streptococci (EGM) and anaerobic bacteria found in primary molars with necrotic pulps. A total of 21 children (37 teeth) participated in this study. Initial (pre-treatment) and final (14 days post-treatment) intra-canal samples were collected for microbiological analysis and were incubated in Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin plates under microaerophilic conditions for EGM counting; as well as in Brucella-agar plates, anaerobically, to allow growth of anaerobic bacteria. The success rate of the <b>pulpectomies</b> after a 12 months follow-up were also evaluated based on clinical and radiographic parameters. Chlorhexidine gel significantly reduced EGM levels (p= 0, 010, Wilcoxon test), whereas Callen PMCCÂ significantly reduced anaerobic bacteria levels (p= 0, 002). Significant difference was observed when comparing EGM reduction levels between the Chlorhexidine and Control groups (p= 0, 032, Mann-Whitney test). The success rate was 81, 71 % in the Callen PMCCÂ group, 78. 57 % in the Chlorhexidine group and 77. 77 % in the control group.

40|$|Introduction: Dental {{treatment}} {{is usually a}} poignant phenomenon for children. Projective scales are preferred over psychometric scales to recognize it, and to obtain the self-report from children. Aims: The aims were to evaluate treatment related fear using a newly developed fear scale for children, fear assessment picture scale (FAPS), and anxiety with colored version of modified facial affective scale (MFAS) - three faces along with physiologic responses (pulse rate and oxygen saturation) obtained by pulse oximeter before and during <b>pulpectomy</b> procedure. Settings and Design: Total, 60 children of age 6 - 8 years who were visiting the dental hospital {{for the first time}} and needed <b>pulpectomy</b> treatment were selected. Children selected were of sound physical, physiological, and mental condition. Two projective scales were used; one to assess fear - FAPS and to assess anxiety - colored version of MFAS - three faces. These were co-related with the physiological responses (oxygen saturation and pulse rate) of children obtained by pulse oximeter before and during the <b>pulpectomy</b> procedure. Statistical Analysis Used: Shapiro-Wilk test, McNemar′s test, Wilcoxon signed ranks test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney test were applied in the study. Results: The physiological responses showed association with FAPS and MFAS though not significant. However, oxygen saturation with MFAS showed a significant change between "no anxiety" and "some anxiety" as quantified by Kruskal-Wallis test value 6. 287, P = 0. 043 (< 0. 05) before <b>pulpectomy</b> procedure.

Materials and Methods: <b>Pulpectomy</b> of 64 nonvital primary molars were accomplished in 39 children aged 3 - 9 years. Teeth were randomly divided into four equal groups of 16 molars according to the type of root canal filling. <b>Pulpectomy</b> was performed in one stage using 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite irrigation and stainless-steel crown for final restoration. Clinical and radiographic results were evaluated double-blindly for two periods of 6, 12 months. Data were analyzed using Chi-square/Fisher′s exact test, and P-value was set as 0. 05. Results: The four pastes achieved convergent clinical and radiographic success within the two observation periods (P > 0. 05). ZOE paste was the slowest in its resorption. Conclusions: ZOP is a promising paste with its natural antibacterial component (propolis). ZOE paste had convergent efficacy to the other pastes...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{anesthetic}} efficacy of 0. 5 % bupivacaine with 1 : 200, 000 epinephrine with that of 2 % lidocaine with 1 : 100, 000 epinephrine during <b>pulpectomy</b> in patients with irreversible pulpitis in mandibular posterior teeth. Methods: Seventy volunteers, patients with irreversible pulpitis admitted to the Emergency Center of the School of Dentistry at the University of Sao Paulo, randomly received a conventional inferior alveolar nerve block containing 3. 6 mL of either 0. 5 % bupivacaine with 1 : 200, 000 epinephrine or 2 % lidocaine with 1 : 100, 000 epinephrine. During the subsequent <b>pulpectomy,</b> we recorded the patients subjective assessments of lip anesthesia, the absence/presence of pulpal anesthesia through electric pulp stimulation, and the absence/presence of pain through a verbal analog scale. Results: All patients reported lip anesthesia after the application of either inferior alveolar nerve block. By measuring pulpal anesthesia success with the pulp tester, lidocaine had a higher success rate (42. 9 %) than bupivacaine (20 %). For patients reporting none or mild pain during <b>pulpectomy,</b> the success rate of bupivacaine was 80 % and lidocaine was 62. 9 %. There were only statistically significant differences to the success of pulpal anesthesia. Conclusions: Neither of the solutions resulted in an effective pain control during irreversible pulpitis treatments of mandibular molars. (J Endod 2012; 38 : 594 - 597...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} {{the prevalence of}} inflammatory root resorption and associated factors in 1068 primary mandibular molars in 453 children 3 to 12 years of age. Age, dental history and medical history were recorded using a questionnaire administered to the children's parents/caregivers. Previously trained and calibrated examiners assessed radiographic images of the primary molars by direct observation, {{with the aid of}} a viewing box. Root resorption (physiological or inflammatory), dental crown status (healthy, carious with no pulp involvement, carious with pulp involvement and evidence of restoration), and pulpotomy or <b>pulpectomy</b> were determined. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, the chi-square test and a multiple logistic regression (p < 0. 05). The prevalence of inflammatory root resorption was 16. 2 % (n = 173). The male gender (OR: 1. 4; 95 % CI), the 3 -to- 7 -years age bracket (OR: 1. 5; 95 % CI), an unhealthy dental crown (OR: 8. 7; 95 % CI), caries with pulp involvement (OR: 7. 4; 95 % CI), pulpotomy (OR: 3. 1; 95 % CI), and <b>pulpectomy</b> (OR: 5. 4; 95 % CI) were risk factors for the occurrence of inflammatory root resorption in primary molars. In conclusion, the prevalence of inflammatory root resorption in the present sample was 16. 2 %. Gender, age, an unhealthy tooth, caries with pulp involvement, pulpotomy, <b>pulpectomy,</b> and the absence of a restoration were associated with a higher occurrence of inflammatory root resorption in primary molars...|$|E
40|$|Intracanal {{medication}} in <b>pulpectomy</b> {{therapy is}} used between appointments with the Objective of reducing pain and inflammatory processes in pulp and periapical tissues. Propolis {{has been known}} as a natural antibiotic and has been subject of medical and dental research due to its therapeutic properties such as antibiotic, analgesic and anti- inflammatory effects. Objective: The aim was to carry out an in vivo evaluation of the periapical tissue response to propolis paste when used as an intracanal medication {{in the teeth of}} dogs after <b>pulpectomy.</b> Material and Methods: 72 dog’s incisors were selected for the experiment. After biomechanical preparation the root canal was filled with a corticosteroid-antibiotic preparation, experimental propolis paste, non-medicament (negative control) or non-pulpectomy at all (positive control). The medications were left inside the root canal for 7, 14 or 28 days. At the end of the experimental period histological sections were prepared and all laboratories processes for Harris hematoxylin and eosin staining was proceeded followed by the analysis using an optical microscope. Sections were classified according to a score representing the inflammatory events observed: the presence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, polymorphonuclear eosinophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells, macrophages and/or giant cells, fibrous condensation and abscesses. Results: There were statistically significant differences between the tissue reactions caused by the two substances being tested, after different experimental periods, with the periapical tissue that was in contact with propolis paste exhibiting fewer inflammatory reactions in comparison to corticosteroid-antibiotic preparation. Conclusions: The low tissue responses from propolis paste suggest that this material could be considered as an option for root canal medication after <b>pulpectomy...</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The loss {{of dental}} pulp may weaken teeth, {{rendering}} them susceptible to reinfection, fracture, and subsequent tooth loss. Therefore, regeneration of pulp {{is considered an}} ideal treatment to preserve teeth. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the capacity of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to regenerate dental pulp in canine mature permanent teeth. Methods: <b>Pulpectomy</b> with apical foramen enlarged to a # 80 file was performed in 16 upper premolars of 4 beagle dogs. Four experimental groups were randomly established: (1) the blood clot group, (2) the autologous DPSCs group, (3) the PRP group, and (4) the DP + PRP group (a mixture of DPSCs and PRP). Four lower premolars without any further treatment after <b>pulpectomy</b> were used as the control group. All teeth were sealed with mineral trioxide aggregate and composite. Twelve weeks after transplantation, the teeth were subjected to radiographic and histologic examination. Results: Twenty-four of 32 experimental root canals gained newly formed tissues. All canals with an introduction of a blood clot showed histologic evidence of vital tissue formation. Cementum-like and periodontal ligament-like tissues along the internal root canal walls were typical structures in most cases. There is no significant difference between groups with or without autologous DPSC transplantation (exact chi-square test, P <. 05). Conclusions: New vital tissues can be regenerated in permanent canine teeth after <b>pulpectomy</b> and enlargement of the apical foramen. Histologically, transplantation of DPSCs and/or PRP into root canals showed no enhancement in new tissue formation compared with inducement of a blood clot into the root canals alone. © 2012 American Association of Endodontists.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate, histopathologically, the {{effectiveness}} of mechanical preparation of root canals using different irrigating solutions in dog teeth filled with LPS after <b>pulpectomy.</b> A total of 120 root canals of 6 mongrel dogs were filled with a solution of LPS after <b>pulpectomy.</b> The irrigating solutions used were saline, 1, 2. 5, and 5 % sodium hypochlorite, and 2 % chlorhexidine. No irrigation was used in the control group. The animals were sacrificed after 60 days and the teeth were fixed and demineralized. Subsequently, serial 6 -µm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Mallory’s trichrome for histopathological analysis and Brown-Brenn for verification of bacterial contamination. Analysis showed that the inflammatory infiltrate was statistically less intense in the groups in which the root canals were irrigated with 5 % sodium hypochlorite and 2 % chlorhexidine. However, none of the irrigating solutions completely inactivated the harmful effects of LPS. Mechanical preparation associated with different irrigating solutions did not completely inactivate LPS.

40|$|Aim: The University of Pretoria Oral Health Centre (UPOHC) is {{inundated}} {{by patients}} who demand emergency pulpectomies. The demand for service however exceeds {{the capacity to}} treat, which may be problematic in terms of treatment outcomes. The {{aim of this study}} is therefore to measure the outcome of emergency pulpectomies at the UPOHC. Method: The electronic and paper records of 498 randomly selected teeth that received an emergency <b>pulpectomy</b> at the UPOHC from 1 July 2012 until 30 June 2013 were examined to determine the outcome of the treatment. The completion rate over time was calculated in combination with the percentage of teeth that was eventually extracted or referred for extraction. In the case where the root canal treatment (RCT) reached the obturation phase, the post-operative radiographs were analysed in terms of the technical quality of the obturation. Results: Forty-five percent of the sample size of 498 teeth for which an emergency <b>pulpectomy</b> was performed returned to have the RCT completed. Of these, 43 % were inadequately obturated. Eight percent of teeth observed referred for extraction. Seven percent of teeth had the initial phase of treatment repeated while 40 % were never seen again after the initial <b>pulpectomy.</b> A total of 46. 96 % of the teeth were still incomplete after 16. 56 months. Conclusion: The results of the study indicate that the UPOHC has a limited capacity to complete RCTs. A strategy is needed to expand the region’s resources and to incorporate a preventative dental focus. However, this will require an intervention in the functioning of the dental health system with regard to government funding in order to achieve success in both service delivery and education. An audit of the current undergraduate endodontic curriculum is perhaps necessary to improve students’ skills and efficiency in the service learning environment.
