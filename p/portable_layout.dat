40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a GaAs data-path {{compiler}} for the public domain ALLIANCE CAD SYSTEM[l]. Based upon macro cells generators, cells libraries, and software tools, it provides a fast and easy way to describe and implement bit-sliced structures for DCFL logic. The use of over cells-routing, power supplies sharing and multiple access termi­nals coupled to a symbolic approach leads to a high density <b>portable</b> <b>layout...</b>|$|E
50|$|Wiring {{requirements}} are generally reduced {{compared to a}} conventional DC powered layout. With digital control of accessories, the wiring is distributed to accessory decoders rather than being individually connected to a central control panel. For <b>portable</b> <b>layouts</b> this can greatly {{reduce the number of}} inter-board connections - only the digital signal and any accessory power supplies need cross baseboard joins.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{emphasizes}} the need for multipurpose test chips and comprehensive procedures for use in supplying accurate input data to both logic and circuit simulators and chip layout aids. It is shown that the location of test structures within test chips is critical in obtaining representative data, because geometrical distortions introduced during the photomasking process can lead to significant intrachip parameter variations. In order to transfer test chip designs quickly, accurately, and economically, a commonly accepted <b>portable</b> chip <b>layout</b> notation and commonly accepted parametric tester language are needed. In order to measure test chips more accurately and more rapidly, parametric testers with improved architecture {{need to be developed}} in conjunction with innovative test structures with on-chip signal conditioning...|$|R
5000|$|Two other {{noteworthy}} early laptops {{were the}} Sharp PC-5000 and the Gavilan SC, announced in 1983 but first sold in 1984. The Gavilan was notably the first computer to be marketed as a [...] "laptop". It was also {{equipped with a}} pioneering touchpad-like pointing device, installed on a panel above the keyboard. Like the GRiD Compass, the Gavilan and the Sharp were housed in clamshell cases, but they were partly IBM-compatible, although primarily running their own system software. Both had LCDs, and could connect to optional external printers. The Dulmont Magnum, launched internationally in 1984, was an Australian <b>portable</b> similar in <b>layout</b> to the Gavilan, which used the Intel 80186 processor.|$|R
40|$|The Graph Layout Toolkit is {{a family}} of <b>portable,</b> automated, graph <b>layout</b> {{libraries}} designed for integration into graphical user interface application programs. The Circular Library {{is one of the}} four styles currently available with the Graph Layout Toolkit. It produces layouts that emphasize natural group structures inherent in a graph's topology, and is well suited for the layout of ring and star network topologies. It clusters (groups) the nodes of a graph by group IDs, by IP adresses, and by biconnectivity or node degree, and allows the user to specify a range for the size of each cluster. The Library positions the nodes of a cluster on a radiating circle, and employs heuristics to reduce the crossings not only between edges incident to nodes of the same cluster but also between edges that connect different clusters...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA PCI {{compliant}} three-state input/output buffer featuring {{low power}} consumption, absence of passive elements and easy mapping on different target processes is presented. Firstly, a <b>portable</b> approach to <b>layout</b> using a process independent unit, named λ, that allows - in first approximation - to scale {{the design is}} introduced. Secondly, the PCI requirements and outline the main constraint for CMOS pads design are presented, that is, minimum fan-out and maximum slew rate are incompatible using a classical buffer. This leads {{to the definition of}} a buffer being where driving power and output slew rate are controlled independently. A full transistor scheme is presented and it is shown how to reach the PCI specifications using appropriate sizes for the transistors. It turns out that a power vs delay trade-off can be done by modifying a few transistor widths. Compliance is obtained using the same λ layout for two 0. 8 μm and two 0. 5 μm technologies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a PCI compliant three-state input/output pad that feature low power consumption, absence of passive elements and easy mapping an different target processes. Firstly, we quickly present a <b>portable</b> approach to <b>layout</b> using a process independent unit, named /spl lambda/, that allows to scale the design. Secondly, we introduce the PCI requirements, and outline the important constraints for CMOS pads design: minimum fan-out and maximum slew rate are incompatible using a simple buffer. Finally, we propose a schematic in the which driving power and slew rate are controlled independently. Compared to other possible designs that could include passive elements, this full transistor approach greatly simplifies technology migration and {{turns out to}} minimise power consumption. Transistors' size for output power and slew rate control are determined using a few spice simulations. PCI compliance has been obtained on two 0. 8 /spl mu/m processes under 5 V, and two 0. 5 /spl mu/m processes under 3. 3 V with the same transistors size in /spl lambda/...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{operation}} of the APS facility requires a very stable particle beam. Vi brationcûupled thrûugh mechanical sy,stems, such as magnet suppûrts, beam tube supports, and other paths can cause deterioration of the particle beam. There are two sources of vibration: external, or far field, which is generated external to the APS site and internal, or near field, which is generated on site and associated with {{operation of}} the facility. Internal vibration sources can be controlled or minimized using good design practices to eliminate or reduce vibration amplitudes of machinery and equipment. Depending on their origin, external vibra. tion sources mayor may not be controllable, therefore {{it is necessary to}} have sufficient knowledge of their amplitude level and frequency content to predict any adverse effects on the {{operation of the}} APS facility. OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study was measure the far field ground vibration over long time periods to get an accurate representation of its characteristics (amplitude and frequency) for both active (weekday) and inactive (weekend) times at ANL. As a secondary objective, the instrumentation installed for the above was used to measure the response resulting from vehicular traffic on the road adjacent to one of the measurement locations. LOCATION AN TIME Measurements were conducted in the vicinity of Building 335 {{to take advantage of the}} proximity of the required data acquisition and processing equipment which is located in Building 335 and not <b>portable.</b> A <b>layout</b> of the measurement locations as refe renced to Building 335 is shown in Fig. 1.

50|$|There {{are various}} types of {{difficulty}} settings in this game, and specifics vary from game to game. Usually {{there are at least}} Arcade, Mission and Freestyle options available. During Arcade and Freestyle, the player has the option of choosing which button layout to follow. Button layouts scale from just two buttons up to a maximum of eight buttons. Which button layouts are available for the player depends on the type of game. For example, original DJMAX <b>Portable</b> features button <b>layouts</b> 4B, 6B and 8B, while DJMAX Portable 2 features button layouts 4B, 5B, 6B and 8B. Button layouts offer first selection of difficulty for player. 4B being the easy mode and 8B being hard mode. Every song in the DJMAX Portable series and Trilogy has a rating which indicates the difficulty of the song. Some songs are available in more difficult formats. For example, the player can try to play an 8B song fitted for a 6B layout. These are marked usually with HD (Hard), MX (Maximum) or SC (Super Crazy) as opposed to NM (Normal) of the 6B layout default difficulty. It significantly increases difficulty from the 6B NM mode when player plays 6B MX instead. It allows player to have higher score in 6B layout mode.|$|R
