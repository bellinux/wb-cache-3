40|$|This paper {{discusses}} helicopter {{modeling and}} identification related aspects. By applying the system identification methodology, longitudinal, and lateral-directional rigid body helicopter dynamics are identified from flight data. Aerodynamic parameters from single input excitation, {{as well as}} multimaneuver evaluation, are estimated utilizing output-error approach. The formulated mathematical models yield adequate fits to measured time histories. Results obtained from the <b>proof-of-match</b> for model validation indicate that the identified derivatives can satisfactorily predict longitudinal dynamics to a given arbitrary input. It is further demonstrated that lateral body dynamics can be adequately predicted by including cross-coupling terms in the estimation model...|$|E
40|$|The {{mathematical}} model {{pertaining to the}} rigid-body aircraft motion and the corresponding flight estimated aerodynamic data base for DA 42 NG are presented in this report. The aerodynamic data base meets the requirements specified by the FAA for a FTD Level 6 simulator in the in-flight regime with both engines operating. The data base includes the three flap configurations, landing gear effects on in-air aerodynamics, and the stall approach regime. The aim of the present report is to provide the simulator manufacturer DSIM adequate details to implement the flight dynamics model. The following aspects are covered in detail: i) Equations of aircraft motion, ii) Rigid-body aerodynamic data base for computing the forces and moments, iii) Flight specific information, iv) Aircraft mass characteristics and v) Demonstration of model fidelity through <b>proof-of-match</b> for FAA specified in-air validation tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{mathematical}} models {{pertaining to}} the flight control systems and the corresponding flight-estimated aerodynamic hinge moment database for DA 42 NG are presented in this report. The aerodynamic hinge moment database meets the requirements specified by the configurations, landing gear effects on flight control systems, and the stall approach regime. The aim of the present report is to provide the simulator manufacturer DSIM adequate details to implement the flight control system models.

Changes in the text compared to {{the first version of}} this report (dated 28 June 2010) are marked by a vertical line at the side. Additionally, all trim sheets and validation plots have been exchanged...|$|E
