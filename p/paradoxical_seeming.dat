This aerosol is then liquified by pressure, using a specially-designed boiler feed pump. A fuel saving of nearly 30% (compared with exhausting to the atmosphere) was claimed for the Anderson system but this <b>seems</b> <b>paradoxical.</b> One would expect a higher fuel consumption because of the power required to compress the aerosol.|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea that}} the {{collection}} of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist <b>seems</b> <b>paradoxical</b> to many. This is related to Cesare Burali-Forti's [...] "paradox" [...] which states {{that there can be}} no greatest ordinal number. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.|$|R

Although these effects are mainly confined to the near- and intermediate-field zones, some of them <b>seem</b> <b>paradoxical</b> and still lack adequate physical interpretation. 1...|$|R

The results of a survey of 77 senior year undergraduate students show that reasonable appearing and consistent responses to willingness to pay questions on car crash protection can be obtained.

Also, no relationship was found between willingness to pay responses and variables reflecting respondent's rational considerations.
