5|$|Bath {{once had}} an {{important}} manufacturing sector, particularly in crane manufacture, furniture manufacture, printing, brass foundries, quarries, dye works and <b>Plasticine</b> manufacture, {{as well as many}} mills. Significant Bath companies included Stothert & Pitt, Bath Cabinet Makers and Bath & Portland Stone.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} funded by SBS Independent, the Australian Film Commission and Film Victoria, and it was filmed and {{animated}} by Adam Elliot and two assistants over 15 months in 2001–2003, using models made of <b>plasticine</b> and other materials. The production was completed in May 2003 and Harvie Krumpet premiered a month later at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, followed by over 100 subsequent film festival screenings. It won many accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The game began {{development}} in September 1995, {{as part of}} a publishing deal with BMG Interactive. When this deal fell through, the development team turned their focus to the Nintendo 64, which allowed for a more advanced environment and model processing. The hardware also shaped the game's humour and style, with a soft focus look leading to a style akin to <b>Plasticine</b> models. The game's distinct British humour was also used to distinguish it from other games. Similarly, the game's music was created to resemble B movies.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the main}} puppet cast to feature in the film, such as Scott Tracy, were re-made from the {{original}} marionettes, while previously unseen characters such as the Zero-X astronauts, Cliff Richard and the bandmembers of The Shadows were sculpted especially. Whereas guest star puppets for Series One had been recycled for each appearance and moulded in <b>Plasticine,</b> since {{this was the first}} occasion when puppets in an AP Films production were intended to represent real-life celebrities, most of the supporting puppets were made from fibreglass to the same standards of workmanship as the main puppets.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{were often}} first sketched by Oliver, before {{she moved to}} {{construction}} in three dimensions. When preparing commissions, she would draw on the ideas of clients or {{the nature of the}} site. For large works she created maquettes (or models), sometimes in <b>plasticine,</b> on other occasions using copper wire or, in the case of her 2002 sculpture Globe, wood and metal. Oliver would produce the more delicate works herself. Many were created by crafting and joining wire to create abstract forms. These were built around moulds, twisting the metal into place with pliers, before severing it with wirecutters. Joins were soldered or brazed (though in some pieces, the wire was woven). In Web (2002), copper pieces were sewn together using wire.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} men in {{leadership}} positions {{were likely to be}} wounded or killed, soldiers learned the jobs of those beside and above them. At the British First Army headquarters, a large-scale <b>plasticine</b> model of the Vimy sector was constructed and used to show commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers the topographical features of the battlefield and details of the German trench system. In addition, upwards of 40,000 topographical trench maps were printed and distributed to ensure that even platoon sergeants and section commanders possessed a wider awareness of the battlefield. These measures gave each platoon a clearer picture of how it fitted into the greater battle plan and in so doing, reduced the command and control problems that plagued First World War combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} the stadium {{combines}} a number of elements {{for use in the}} jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40-metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. Jumps are measured from a take off board—typically a small strip of wood with a <b>plasticine</b> marker attached—which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40-metre running track and has an indentation in the ground (the box) where vaulters plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto cushioned landing mats. The high jump is a stripped down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it.|$|E
5|$|As the {{gameplay}} {{designs were}} being implemented, Brown switched {{focus to the}} game's aesthetics. Scenes from the game were sketched on storyboards to aid development. Cauldron IIs game world, the witch's castle, was designed to resemble Palace Software's logo as an advertising tactic. Brown photographed separate screens {{of the game and}} assembled them into a complete map, showing the shape of his company's logo, for video game magazines. Enemy designs were similar to those in the previous game, based on the Halloween holiday. Brown envisioned a graphical effect for the game's narration, showing a book whose pages turned as the story is read. However, technical limitations at the time prohibited the implementation of such a visual effect. Brown also wanted the game's visuals to scroll seamlessly as the character moved through the game world, but flick-screening (showing one section of the world at a time) was more feasible. As with the previous game, Brown created a <b>Plasticine</b> model of the witch character as a reference for a painting that was used for the game's box art. The group tested the game prior to release and deemed it too challenging. They reduced the difficulty level so that more players could complete the game.|$|E
25|$|As a {{key part}} of the urban {{landscape}} in many cities, cycle rickshaws have been the subject of films and other artwork, as well as being extensively decorated themselves. The cycle rickshaw in Dhaka is especially well known as a major medium for Bengali folk art, as <b>plasticine</b> cutouts and handpainted figures adorn many cycle rickshaws.|$|E
25|$|The {{sculptor}} {{devoted his}} work to {{the presentation of the}} human body in various circumstances and styles, in sports or at rest, experimenting with figurative, polychrome sculptures, cubism, traditional African art, art deco, classicism or neoclassicism. Using different techniques, including modeling and direct carving, he worked with a range of materials, including clay, stone, marble, wood, <b>plasticine,</b> terracotta, plaster, wax, bronze and silver.|$|E
25|$|Knott {{was known}} for his {{idiosyncratic}} behaviour on the field. His trademarks included always keeping his shirt collar turned up to protect him from the sun; his sleeves rolled down to safeguard his elbows when diving; and, after a tip from former Northamptonshire and England wicket-keeper Keith Andrew, warming his hands with hot water before going on the field. According to Bob Taylor, Knott preferred strong-backed gloves with full webbing and plenty of padding in the palms, wearing two pairs of Chamois inners with strips of <b>plasticine</b> across the palms.|$|E
25|$|Sir Benjamin Baker from Cheltenham jointly-designed the 1890 Forth Bridge. William Murdoch in 1792 lit {{his house}} in Redruth with gas, the first in Britain. <b>Plasticine</b> was invented 1897 in Bath by William Harbutt. Thomas Young of Somerset {{is known for his}} double-slit {{experiment}} in optics, and in solid mechanics for his famous Young's modulus. Henry Fox Talbot, inventor of a negative-positive process in 1841, from Wiltshire made the first photograph in August 1835; Nicéphore Niépce of France can claim the first photo in 1826; William Friese-Greene of Bristol is thought to be the father of cinematography after inventing his chronophotographic camera in 1889.|$|E
25|$|The {{golden age}} of toy {{development}} was {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. Real wages were rising steadily in the Western world, allowing even working-class families to afford toys for their children, and industrial techniques of precision engineering and mass production was able to provide the supply to meet this rising demand. Intellectual emphasis was also increasingly being placed on the importance of a wholesome and happy childhood for the future development of children. William Harbutt, an English painter, invented <b>plasticine</b> in 1897, and in 1900 commercial production of the material as a children's toy began. Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture and was responsible for the invention and production of three of the most popular lines of toys based on engineering principles in the twentieth century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways and Dinky Toys.|$|E
25|$|In 1903-4, Munch {{exhibited}} in Paris where the coming Fauvists, {{famous for their}} boldly false colors, likely saw his works and might have found inspiration in them. When the Fauves held their own exhibit in 1906, Munch was invited and displayed his works with theirs. After studying the sculpture of Rodin, Munch may have experimented with <b>plasticine</b> {{as an aid to}} design, but he produced little sculpture. During this time, Munch received many commissions for portraits and prints which improved his usually precarious financial condition. In 1906, he painted the screen for an Ibsen play in the small Kammerspiele Theatre located in Berlin's Deutsches Theater, in which the Frieze of Life was hung. The theatre's director Max Reinhardt later sold it; it is now in the Berlin Nationalgalerie. After an earlier period of landscapes, in 1907 he turned his attention again to human figures and situations.|$|E
25|$|Giger {{conceived}} the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all outside forces. He mandated that the creature have no eyes, {{because he felt}} that it made them much more frightening if you could not tell {{they were looking at}} you. Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located at the tip of a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed biomechanical, a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with <b>plasticine.</b> The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} by clay animation using character models each {{about the size of}} a wine bottle. The models were first constructed using <b>plasticine</b> before pouring Carbog, a solid material used by mechanics, into moulds to form the bodies. They were then painted to appear like <b>plasticine,</b> and real <b>plasticine</b> around wire was used for the arms. Elliot said he chose to use Carbog since models made from just <b>plasticine</b> would require more maintenance. Some characters had replaceable mouths made of hardened Sculpey clay that were attached magnetically to the faces to reflect different facial expressions; Harvie's model had more than 30 separate mouth shapes. The design of the models was influenced by Elliot's tremor, since he needed them to be relatively large and easy to manipulate. He made the models' eyes particularly large [...] "to fully express the character's emotion". He intentionally left fingerprints in the <b>plasticine</b> when manipulating the models to remind the audience that [...] "what they're seeing is tangible, tactile and it's not generated through a computer". He was assisted by Sophie Raymond and Michael Bazeley in constructing and modelling the characters. The sets were largely constructed from wood.|$|E
500|$|A [...] <b>Plasticine</b> {{model of}} the station, city and {{surroundings}} {{was used in the}} inquiry. It was accompanied by a certificate of essentiality, issued by the Electricity Commissioners. Photographs of the city were also shown with the power station superimposed.|$|E
500|$|Main {{character}} {{heads were}} initially sculpted in either <b>Plasticine</b> or clay. Once the general aspect had been finalised, this {{served as the}} template for a silicone rubber mould. This was coated with Bondaglass (fibreglass mixed with resin) and enhanced with Bondapaste, a putty-like substance, to accentuate contours. The Bondaglass shell was then fitted with a solenoid, leather mouth parts and plastic eyes, as well as incisor teeth– a first for a Supermarionation production. Puppets known as [...] "revamps", which had plastic heads, portrayed the supporting characters. These marionettes started their working lives with only a mouth and eyes; their faces were remoulded from one episode to the next. Particularly striking revamp moulds were retained and, as their numbers increased, photographed to compile an internal casting directory.|$|E
500|$|A {{review of}} a more {{critical}} nature came from Catherine Bennett, also writing for The Guardian, who questioned the facial reconstruction from the third episode and suggested that it was dismissive to imply that it was how Jesus truly appeared. Speaking about the study, Bennett remarked: [...] "We must hope that... future BBC controllers do not dig up, say, Robin Cook's skull, drape it in <b>Plasticine,</b> and ask: 'Is this the real face of Tony Blair?. John Preston, writing for The Sunday Telegraph, also questioned {{the reliability of the}} reconstruction, and branded the series as dumbed down. The programme received criticism from theological scholars: following the broadcast of the first episode, Tom Wright, one of two consultants used during production of the series, felt that Jesus's mission had been misrepresented by the show. Wright claimed that the BBC had elected to portray Jesus simply as [...] "a politically correct social worker".|$|E
500|$|Palace Software {{repeated}} the {{strategy for the}} sequel, publishing a poster of Whittaker as Princess Mariana, this time in metal bikini armour, and Michael Van Wijk as the barbarian. [...] Steve Brown, creator of the Barbarian games, recalled that the bikini's chain [...] "snapped a number of times" [...] in comical Carry On fashion during the shoot. [...] Brown was behind {{the concept of the}} poster, which was brought to fruition by Lee Gibbons, a commercial artist, over the course of four weeks. [...] The image of the barbarian and princess poised over the fallen body of a large, scaly monster was a photomontage, created by superimposing three photographsone of each subjecton one another. [...] The creature was a small scale model made of <b>Plasticine.</b> [...] After cutting out the subjects from their photos and composing the cut-outs to form a new scene, Gibbons painted the background and added effects such as smoke to form the final image.|$|E
500|$|Since {{at least}} 1938, Jefferis had been {{toying with the}} idea of a {{demolition}} or anti-tank weapon that would be ideal for irregular warfare. It would work by having an explosive charge deform so that it had a substantial area of intimate contact with the surface of the target. Then, when detonated, the effect of the explosion would be focused on a small area and would rupture an armoured plate much thicker than would otherwise be the case. Sappers call such a device a [...] "poultice" [...] or [...] "squash head" [...] charge. Jefferis enlisted Drs Bauer and Schulman of the Colloid Science Department of Cambridge University, they experimented with lengths of bicycle inner tube filled with <b>plasticine</b> to represent the explosive. These were fitted with wooden handles and dipped in rubber solution to make them sticky. In experiments, these prototypes proved difficult to aim and only by chance did any stick to the metal bins used to represent tanks.|$|E
500|$|For guest roles, puppets {{were mainly}} {{recycled}} from their previous appearances in Thunderbirds Are Go, although the Captain Foster puppet {{was a new}} addition. Puppeteer Wanda Webb recalls that Thunderbird 6 maintained a high standard in the appearance of its cast, commenting on a shot which depicts Lady Penelope asleep on board Skyship One, [...] "I had placed the sleeping eyelids in <b>Plasticine</b> and made the eye shadow a little too blue. We ended up re-shooting the whole sequence." [...] One-use puppets appear in what Supermarionation historian Stephen La Rivière describes as [...] "a contender for the most horrific scene ever produced by Century 21": in the opening scene, the characters of the NWAC executives present gaping mouths and teeth, complete with dental fillings, when Brains' plan to design an airship sends them into howls of laughter. The decision to begin the film with a cold open and delay the title sequence and opening credits was one of Century 21's efforts to distinguish Thunderbird 6 from the preceding film.|$|E
500|$|After test-sculpting in <b>Plasticine,</b> {{the puppet}} heads were moulded on a {{silicone}} rubber base and made using fibreglass. At heights ranging from 20 to 24inches (approximately one-third life-size) the next-generation puppets were no shorter than their predecessors. For previous series, puppet eyes had been sized {{out of proportion}} to the heads, but as part of the realistic look introduced in Captain Scarlet, the eyes of production personnel were photographed and the images scaled down for attachment to the eye sockets. As had been the case for earlier series, a number of alternative heads displaying a range of expressions were created for main character puppets, including [...] "smilers", [...] "frowners" [...] and [...] "blinkers". Since episodes of Captain Scarlet were filmed in pairs, one on each of the puppet stages available at the Century 21 Studios, duplicates were made of the [...] "expressionless" [...] template of each main character. For the pilot episode, an [...] "agony" [...] head was specially sculpted for the Captain Scarlet puppet for a brief reaction shot of Scarlet's Mysteron double being shot by Captain Blue.|$|E
500|$|The game's humour {{and style}} {{was shaped by}} {{hardware}} limitations; when the hardware rendered the character models in soft focus, the team noted that they resembled <b>Plasticine</b> models, and continued to create {{the game with a}} look and style akin to Wallace and Gromit. The game was presented with [...] "distinctive 'British' humour" [...] to distinguish from other games; lead programmer Leslie Benzies and artist Aaron Garbut often presented the team with other Nintendo 64 games, such as Super Mario 64 (1996), to identify the differences. The team ensured that each level felt distinct, while maintaining a coherent style. This diversity was achieved using the development tools, which allowed various members of the team to experiment in creating designs. Manual text writer Brian Baglow said that the game's music provided freedom to the team, as it [...] "doesn't necessarily have to fit the action on the screen". He explained that the audio was designed to fit with the [...] "cheesy, slightly twisted B-movies animation kind of feel". Baglow found that creating the music on a cartridge instead of a CD prompted the team to discover new techniques of working within the boundaries of the former, stating that [...] "people who are doing music for CD-based systems get very, very lazy".|$|E
500|$|Music {{historian}} Simon Reynolds {{argues that}} McLaren {{came into his}} own as an auteur only after the group's break-up, with The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle and the recruitment of Ronnie Biggs as a vocalist. Much subsequent commentary on the Sex Pistols has relied on taking seriously McLaren's onscreen proclamations in the film, whether lending them credence or not. As music journalist Dave Thompson noted in 2000, [...] "oday, Swindle is viewed {{by many as the}} truth" [...] (despite the fact that the movie purveys, among other things, a completely illiterate Steve Jones, a talking dog, and Sid Vicious shooting audience members, including his mother, at the conclusion of [...] "My Way"). Temple points out that McLaren's characterisation was intended as [...] "a big fucking joke—that he was the puppetmeister who created these pieces of clay from <b>plasticine</b> boxes that he modeled away and made Johnny Rotten, made Sid Vicious. It was a joke that they were completely manufactured." [...] (In his final onscreen scene in the film, McLaren declares that he was planning the Sex Pistols affair, [...] "Ever since I was ten years old! Ever since Elvis Presley joined the army!" [...]) Temple acknowledges that McLaren ultimately [...] "perhaps took this too much to heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Giger {{made several}} {{conceptual}} {{paintings of the}} adult Alien before settling on the final version. He sculpted the creature's body using <b>plasticine,</b> incorporating pieces such as vertebrae from snakes and cooling tubes from a Rolls-Royce. The creature's head was manufactured separately by Carlo Rambaldi, who had worked on the aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Rambaldi followed Giger's designs closely, making some modifications in order to incorporate the moving parts which would animate the jaw and inner mouth. A system of hinges and cables was used to operate the creature's rigid tongue, which protruded from its mouth and featured a second mouth at its tip with {{its own set of}} movable teeth. The final head had about 900 moving parts and points of articulation. Part of a human skull was used as the [...] "face", and was hidden under the smooth, translucent cover of the head. Rambaldi's original Alien jaw is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution, while in April 2007 the original Alien suit was sold at auction. Copious amounts of K-Y Jelly were used to simulate saliva and to give the Alien an overall slimy appearance. The creature's vocalizations were provided by Percy Edwards, a voice artist famous for providing bird sounds for British television throughout the 1960s and 1970s as well as the whale sounds for [...] (1977).|$|E
500|$|Brown {{submitted}} concept drawings to Palace co-founder Pete Stone, who approved further development. Influenced {{by what he}} {{deemed a}} [...] "classical witch", Brown designed the witch with a long nose and a broomstick. He created a <b>Plasticine</b> model of the character as a reference for a painting that {{was used for the}} game's box art. Brown was joined by Richard Leinfellner, who served as the lead programmer. The two enjoyed different video game genres—Brown liked platform games, while Leinfellner preferred shoot 'em ups—and decided to create a game engine that could handle both methods of playing. Both developers play tested the game, but only played the segments individually rather than in a sequence. In retrospect, Brown attributes the game's excess difficulty to this along {{with the fact that the}} two played with unlimited game lives. The game was released on three home computers: Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. The Spectrum and Amstrad versions lack scrolling graphics in the shoot 'em up levels and use flick-screening to approximate it. A port of Palace's 1984 game The Evil Dead, originally programmed for the Commodore 64 by Leinfellner, was included on the second side of the Spectrum cassette. Retailers feared a parental backlash, resulting a limited release for the game. Palace chose to include The Evil Dead to distribute the game to a wider audience.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2017 an Australian mother became {{concerned}} about the Safe Schools program after she was told by her children that the program involved, [...] "how to use sex toys, anal sex positions, how to masturbate, and that sexually transmitted infections are no big deal". [...] Her 13 year old son was shown how to construct a <b>plasticine</b> vagina. [...] She subsequently produced a video which has been viewed over 3.5 million times on Facebook.|$|E
2500|$|Waters said, [...] "When I picture {{myself as}} a child, I see myself {{constructing}} something, out of <b>plasticine</b> or papier-mâché or Meccano; I used to enjoy writing poems and stories, too." [...] She wrote stories and poems that she describes as [...] "dreadful gothic pastiches", but had not planned her career. Despite her obvious enjoyment of writing, she did not feel any special calling or preference for becoming a novelist in her youth.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Stevens briefly {{appeared}} in the film , and played a character called [...] "Jane–Mary" [...] in a Spider-Man charity spoof called Spider-Plant Man for the BBC, appearing opposite Rowan Atkinson. In December 2007, {{it was announced that}} Stevens would be transformed into a [...] <b>plasticine</b> character for Glendogie Bogey, a new animated comedy for BBC Scotland. Later in 2005, Stevens also played a minor role in Dominic Veall's ITV television drama Flawless playing Lucy Carlts, the sister of Rodger Carlts. In 2007, The Guardian included Come and Get It in their [...] "1,000 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die" [...] list.|$|E
2500|$|Pottery {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{materials}} for sculpture, as well as clay being the medium in which many sculptures cast in metal are originally modelled for casting. Sculptors often build small preliminary works called maquettes of ephemeral materials such as plaster of Paris, wax, unfired clay, or <b>plasticine.</b> [...] Many cultures have produced pottery which combines a function as a vessel with a sculptural form, and small figurines have often been as popular as they are in modern Western culture. Stamps and moulds were used by most ancient civilizations, from ancient Rome and Mesopotamia to China.|$|E
2500|$|Efforts on {{the first}} {{reconstruction}} began with a [...] "process of familiarisation" [...] with the various fragments; each piece was traced and detailed on a [...] "piece of stiff card", until after [...] "a long while" [...] reconstruction could commence. For this, Maryon sculpted [...] "a head of normal size" [...] from plaster, then [...] "padded the head out above the brows {{to allow for the}} thickness of the lining which a metal helmet would naturally require." [...] The fragments of the skull cap were then initially stuck to the head with <b>Plasticine,</b> or, if thicker, placed into spaces cut into the head. Finally, [...] "strong white plaster" [...] was used to permanently affix the fragments, and, mixed with brown umber, fill in the gaps between pieces. Meanwhile, the fragments of the cheek guards, neck guard, and visor were placed onto shaped, plaster-covered wire mesh, then affixed with more plaster and joined to the cap.|$|E
2500|$|David Fincher {{wanted the}} alien to be, [...] "more of a puma, or a beast" [...] {{as opposed to}} the upright, {{humanoid}} posture of the previous films, so the designer of the original alien, H. R. Giger, was contacted to generate new sketch ideas. His revisions included longer, thinner legs, the removal of [...] "pipes" [...] around the spine, and an idea for a sharp alien [...] "tongue" [...] in place of the secondary jaws. Working from his studio in Zurich, Giger produced these new sketches which he faxed to Cornelius de Fries who then created their model counterparts out of <b>plasticine.</b> The only one of Giger's designs that wound up in the final project was a [...] "Bambi Burster" [...] Alien that had long legs and walked on all fours. ADI also built a full-scale Bunraku-style puppet of this design which was operated on-set as an in-camera effect. Scenes using this approach were cut from the final release due to the limitations of chemical compositing techniques, making it exceedingly difficult to remove the puppeteers from the background plate, but {{can be seen in the}} [...] "Assembly Cut" [...] of the film.|$|E

They bond over a shared history of severe childhood disease and isolating hospitalizations, {{and over time}} develop an intense friendship. Pauline admires Juliet's outspoken arrogance and beauty. Together they paint, write stories, make <b>Plasticine</b> figurines, and eventually create a fantasy kingdom called Borovnia. It is {{the setting of the}} adventure novels they write together, which they hope to have published and eventually made into films in Hollywood. Over time it begins to be as real to them as the real world. Pauline's relationship with her mother, Honora, becomes increasingly hostile and the two fight constantly. This angry atmosphere is in contrast to the peaceful intellectual life Juliet shares with her family. Pauline spends most of her time at the Hulmes', where she feels accepted. [...] Juliet introduces Pauline to the idea of [...] "the Fourth World", a Heaven without Christians where music and art are celebrated. Juliet believes she will go there when she dies.
