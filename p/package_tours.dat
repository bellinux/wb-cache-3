5|$|Although the use {{of small}} private vessels for {{personal}} transport undoubtably extends back into prehistory, large ships capable of braving the open ocean were typically dedicated to trade or fishing for most of human history. Even military campaigns would often simply hire or commandeer these private fleets to serve as troop transports, as did the traders, pilgrims, and wealthy tourists of antiquity and the Middle Ages. The voyages of exploration and colonization were often provided for by the crown out of naval funds; where they were not, they were usually chartered or else purchased and then used for shipping supplies after the initial settlement. Dedicated and scheduled local passenger services came to be offered in the 16th and 17th centuries, but the 1817 Black Ball was the first trans-Atlantic passenger line. In the Age of Sail, the duration of such passages depended much on the prevailing winds and the weather. The 18th-century coastal Margate hoys began the popularization of leisure travel in Britain and Ireland that later gathered steam with Thomas Cook's <b>package</b> <b>tours</b> in the next century. During the 19th century, steam-powered ocean liners connected the railroad networks of the world. By 1900, the Atlantic crossing took about five days and the passenger lines competed to win the Blue Riband, an unofficial accolade accorded to the fastest liner in regular service. For twenty years from 1909, the prize went to the RMS Mauretania for its average speed of 26.06 knots (48.26km/h). This era waned as cheaper and faster intercontinental flights became available, most importantly the 1958 New York City–Paris route.|$|E

25|$|The {{real problem}} for Barbados is that tourist {{facilities}} are too densely concentrated on the south coast, which is highly urbanised, while the Atlantic coast, with its rugged shoreline and large waves, is not suitable for beach tourism. There are few large brand-name hotels which makes marketing the island in the United States difficult. On the other hand, the absence of conglomerates and <b>package</b> <b>tours</b> results in a far greater trickle-down of tourist spending among the general population.|$|E

Tourism and Hospitality ManagementThe {{focus of}} this study was to {{determine}} tourists' preferences of the content of <b>packaged</b> <b>tours</b> in the Mahikeng area. <b>Packaged</b> <b>tours</b> are designed without really knowing whether such tours will be purchased. The preferences of tourists differ in terms of all the components of tourism incorporated into <b>packaged</b> <b>tours.</b> Preferences can be influenced by the reasons of travelling. Tour operators play a significant role in designing and selling tourism packages. It is therefore crucial for them to recognise the preferences of current and potential customers.
