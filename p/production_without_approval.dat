5|$|In 2008, {{there were}} rumors of a {{three-dimensional}} Kid Icarus game for the Wii that was allegedly developed by the German American studio Factor 5. However, the title {{was said to be}} in <b>production</b> <b>without</b> the <b>approval</b> of Nintendo, and Factor 5 cancelled multiple projects following the closure of its American branch in early 2009. In a 2010 interview, Yoshio Sakamoto was asked about a Kid Icarus game for the Wii, to which he replied that he was not aware of any plans to revive the franchise. A new series entry for the Nintendo 3DS, , was eventually revealed at the E3 2010 trade show and was released in 2012. The game is a 3D shooter, and was developed by Project Sora, the company of Super Smash Bros. designer Masahiro Sakurai.|$|R
5000|$|The {{success of}} the London {{production}} led its producer, Horace Sedger, to establish at least three touring companies, which visited major towns and cities in Britain {{for a year and}} a half, from March 1892 to mid-November 1893. Louie René played Ultrice on one tour in 1893. While playing in Manchester, one touring company found itself competing with a DOyly Carte Opera Company touring company at a nearby theatre. The strained relations between Carte and Gilbert after The Gondoliers did not prevent the two companies from playing a cricket match in May 1892. Relations between Gilbert and his new producer had also deteriorated, and the author unsuccessfully sued Sedger for cutting the size of the chorus in the London <b>production</b> <b>without</b> his <b>approval.</b> It was toured for a year in America by the Lillian Russell Opera Company, starring Lillian Russell and C. Hayden Coffin, including a run of a month and a half at the Garden Theatre on Broadway, opening on January 11, 1893. [...] It was also produced in Australia and New Zealand by the J. C. Williamson company until 1900.|$|R
2500|$|On December 24, 2015, Demetrius Shipp, Jr. {{was cast}} as Shakur in a biopic titled All Eyez on Me, which started filming in Atlanta in December 2015. With {{distribution}} from Morgan Creek Productions, the film {{had been in}} development since 2013, with producers Randall Emmett and George Furla having sued Morgan Creek for $10 million in October. Emmett and Furla claimed breach-of-contract after the production company allegedly picked a lead, set a budget and <b>production</b> schedule <b>without</b> their <b>approval.</b> Morgan Creek also sued Afeni Shakur for the music rights for the film. Music video director Benny Boom helmed [...] "All Eyez on Me", which had been hamstrung by production problems. Multiple directors were involved with the film before Boom, including John Singleton and Antoine Fuqua. The film was released on June 16, 2016, what would've been Shakur's 46th birthday.|$|R
