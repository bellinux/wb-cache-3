40|$|Five {{different}} low-Mach large eddy simulations {{are compared}} to the turbulent stratified flame experiments conducted at the Technical University of Darmstadt (TUD). The simulations were contributed by TUD, the Institute for Combustion Technology (ITV) at Aachen, Lund University (LUND), the EM 2 C laboratory at Ecole Centrale Paris, and the University of Duisburg-Essen (UDE). Combustion is modeled by a premixed flamelet tabulation with local flame thickening (TUD), a premixed flamelet progress variable approach coupled to a level set method (ITV), a 4 -steps mechanism combined with implicit LES (LUND), the F-TACLES model {{that is based on}} filtered premixed flamelet tabulation (EM 2 C), and a flame surface density approach (UDE). An extensive comparison of simulation and experimental data is presented for the first two moments of velocity, temperature, mixture fraction, and major species mass fractions. The importance of heat-losses was assessed by comparing simulations for adiabatic and isothermal boundary conditions at the burner walls. The adiabatic computations predict a flame anchored on the burner lip, while the non-adiabatic simulations show a flame lift-off of one half <b>pilot</b> <b>diameter</b> and a better agreement with experimental evidence for temperature and species concentrations. Most simulations agree on the mean flame brush position, but it is evident that subgrid turbulence must be considered to achieve the correct turbulent flame speed. Qualitative comparisons of instantaneous snapshots of the flame show differences {{in the size of the}} resolved flame wrinkling patterns. These differences are (a) caused by the influence of the LES combustion model on the flame dynamics and (b) by the different simulation strategies in terms of grid, inlet condition and numerics. The simulations were conducted with approaches optimized for different objectives, for example low computational cost, or in another case, short turn around. (C) 2015 The Combustion Institute.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the second {{in a series of}} four {{publications}} to document ongoing pilot scale testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of mixing processes in 85 foot diameter, 1. 3 million gallon, radioactive liquid waste, storage tanks at Savannah River Site (SRS). Homogeneous blending of salt solutions is required in waste tanks. Settled solids (i. e., sludge) are required to remain undisturbed on the bottom of waste tanks during blending. Suspension of sludge during blending may potentially release radiolytically generated hydrogen trapped in the sludge, which is a safety concern. The first paper (Leishear, et. al. [1]) presented pilot scale blending experiments of miscible fluids to provide initial design requirements for a full scale blending pump. Scaling techniques for an 8 foot <b>diameter</b> <b>pilot</b> scale tank were also justified in that work. This second paper describes the overall reasons to perform tests, and documents pilot scale experiments performed to investigate disturbance of sludge, using non-radioactive sludge simulants. A third paper will document pilot scale CFD modeling for comparison to experimental pilot scale test results for both blending tests and sludge disturbance tests. That paper will also describe full scale CFD results. The final paper will document additional blending test results for stratified layers in salt solutions, scale up techniques, final full scale pump design recommendations, and operational recommendations. Specifically, this paper documents a series of pilot scale tests, where sludge simulant disturbance due to a blending pump or transfer pump are investigated.

40|$|Pulp lifters, also known, as pan lifters are an {{integral}} part of the majority of autogenous (AG), semi-autogenous (SAG) and grate discharge ball mills. The performance of the pulp lifters in conjunction with grate design determines the ultimate flow capacity of these mills. Although the function of the pulp lifters is simply to transport the slurry passed through the discharge grate into the discharge trunnion, their performance depends on their design as well as that of the grate and operating conditions such as mill speed and charge level. However, little or no work has been reported on the performance of grate-pulp lifter assemblies and in particular the influence of pulp lifter design on slurry transport. Ideally, the discharge rate through a grate-pulp lifter assembly should be equal to the discharge rate through at a given mill hold-up. However, the results obtained have shown that conventional pulp lifter designs cause considerable restrictions to flow resulting in reduced flow capacity. In this second of a two-part series of papers the performance of conventional pulp lifters (radial and spiral designs) is described and is based on extensive test work carried out in a I m <b>diameter</b> <b>pilot</b> SAG mill.

The postoperative recovery, dry matter intake (DMI) and average {{daily weight gain}} (ADG) was evaluated in 36 Nellore steers, nine of which were randomly selected {{for the control group}} and 27 others were rib biopsied. Every 30 days, rib biopsy was performed in nine steers, using a corded-electric pistol-grip drill coupled with a hole saw of a 3 mm <b>diameter</b> <b>pilot</b> drill bit. This rib biopsy technique provided a suitable sample obtained in a fast way and allowed the surgeon to work alone with the animal slightly sedated and restrained in the crush. Dry matter intake (DMI) was not affected in biopsied animals. At the end of the experimental period (116 days) the average daily weight gain (ADG) was similar in the steers biopsied or not. The described method provided rib samples from cattle suitable for densitometry and chemical analysis of bone tissue without effects on health and performance.

40|$|Research was {{completed}} at Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to investigate processes {{related to the}} blending of radioactive, liquid waste, salt solutions in 4920 cubic meter, 25. 9 meter diameter storage tanks. One process was the blending of large salt solution batches (up to 1135 ? 3028 cubic meters), using submerged centrifugal pumps. A second process was the disturbance of a settled layer of solids, or sludge, on the tank bottom. And a third investigated process was the settling rate of sludge solids if suspended into slurries by the blending pump. To investigate these processes, experiments, CFD models (computational fluid dynamics), and theory were applied. Experiments were performed using simulated, non-radioactive, salt solutions referred to as supernates, and a layer of settled solids referred to as sludge. Blending experiments were performed in a 2. 44 meter <b>diameter</b> <b>pilot</b> scale tank, and flow rate measurements and settling tests were performed at both pilot scale and full scale. A summary of the research is presented here to demonstrate the adage that, ?One good experiment fixes {{a lot of good}} theory?. Experimental testing was required to benchmark CFD models, or the models would have been incorrectly used. In fact, CFD safety factors were established by this research to predict full-scale blending performance.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 147 - 153). The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is {{a powerful}} modelling tool that characterises the system at the individual particle level. This makes it particularly well suited for simulating tumbling mills whose charge is principally individual particles (steel balls, rocks and fines). The use of DEM to simulate tumbling mills has proliferated since the early 1990 s and been successfully employed to predict important milling parameters such as charge motion, power draw, liner wear and impact energy distribution. The ultimate aim of any model of the tumbling mill is to predict {{the product of the}} milling process. Current DEM simulations of the tumbling mill however do not simulate the breakage of the particles and as such can not directly predict the product. In order to predict the performance of industrial-scale tumbling mills, laboratory-scale mills are used to experimentally obtain data, which is then scaled up using black box mathematical models. In this thesis a tumbling mill model that utilises the power of DEM to provide the mechanical environment and the energies available for breakage is proposed. The incorporation of DEM eliminates the need to scale up because DEM is able to simulate the actual industrial-scale device. Data from breakage experiments on the ore being treated is also incorporated into the model to determine the breakage functions. Population balance techniques are applied in the mathematical framework of the model to predict the product of the comminution process. In order to test the proposed tumbling mill model, DEM simulations of a 1. 695 m <b>diameter</b> <b>pilot</b> SAG mill using charge based on actual operation data were performed and analysed.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{challenge}} for the CO 2 post combustion capture from power plant flue gases is {{the reduction of the}} energy requirement for solvent regeneration. The required reduction can only be achieved by application of new solvents. For the validation of new solvents in the absorption/desorption process, a <b>pilot</b> plant (column <b>diameters</b> 0. 125  m, absorber packing height 4. 2  m, flue gas flow 30 – 110  kg/h, CO 2 partial pressure 35 – 135  mbar) was built in the EUproject CASTOR. To obtain a baseline for testing of new solvents, first systematic studies were carried out with MEA in that plant. All important process parameters, i. e. CO 2 content in the flue gas, CO 2 removal rate ΨCO 2, fluid dynamic load, and solvent flow rate were varied. These studies allow detailed insight into the process, e. g., a quantification of the different contributions to the overall regeneration energy (namely: desorption enthalpy, stripping steam, heating up of solvent feed and condensate recycle) {{as a function of the}} chosen process parameters. A rate-based model of the process based on a detailed physico-chemical model was implemented in the process simulator CHEMASIM. It is shown that the model is able to predict the experimental results for MEA. Besides MEA, two new solvents were studied in the pilot plant. A direct comparison of different solvents in such pilot plant experiments is not trivial. The comparison of only a few operating points for the new solvents with seemingly corresponding results for MEA can lead to wrong conclusions, since for each solvent an optimisation of the operating conditions is necessary. Only systematical studies allow a meaningful comparison. The technique that was used in the present work for this purpose was measuring data sets at constant CO 2 removal rate (by adjustment of the regeneration energy in the desorber) and systematically varying the solvent flow rate. A minimal energy requirement for the given removal rate is found from theses studies. Only the optima for different solvents should be compared. By this procedure, one solvent candidate was identified that shows an advantage compared to MEA...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{gasification}} {{experiments were}} conducted and proved that with proper moisture content (usually near 10 %) animal manure can be gasified using the TAMU fluidized bed gasifier. In summary the following has been established. ? The heating value of dairy manure on a dry basis {{was found to}} be 15. 93 + 0. 26 MJ/kg (6, 863 + 112 Btu/lb), typical of most agricultural biomass. The heating value was around 14. 09 MJ/kg (6, 070 Btu/lb), on an ?as received? basis (around 13 % moisture). ? The heating value of synthesis gas from gasification of animal manure was estimated to be around 4. 2 MJ/m 3 (113 Btu/ft 3). This value is very similar to most synthesis gas from agricultural residues. ? Synthesis gas production per unit weight of manure was estimated to be 2. 11 m 3 /kg. The gas production energy efficiency was estimated to be around 55. 6 % (i. e. 55. 6 % of the energy was contained in the synthesis gas). ? Char production was on the average around 20 % of the feed input. The average heating value of manure char was around 19 MJ/kg (8, 816 Btu/lb). Thus, the char energy conversion efficiency was approximately 24 % (i. e. 24 % of the energy was still contained in the char). ? Twenty percent (20 %) of the energy from the biomass was used during the gasification to maintain the temperature of the reactor. Gasification is a continuous, endothermic process and thus, no external fuel is needed other than that used during startup. Natural gas was used during start-up and would last around 30 minutes. After the initial heating of the reactor, part of the biomass materials were used to maintain the operating temperature and the natural gas fuel source was shut off. ? The chemical formula for dairy manure during combustion is shown below. This formula was used only for stoichiometric calculation purposes only. ? Eutectic point analysis of the manure ash showed that the inorganic ash components will start to melt at around 600 ?C (1112 ?F). This was established using compressive strength as an indicator of fusion reactions. ?

40|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to achieve adequate screw fixation for plate constructs in fractures with poor quality bone or in metaphyseal bone with extensive bone loss or comminution[7][17]. Furthermore, rescuing or augmenting failed screw fixation in inadequate bone with various cement products has yielded mixed results when tested with pure axial pullout loading[20][21]. In most cases, plate/screw constructs experience both vertical (translational) and horizontal (pullout) forces during physiologic loading[17][20][21]. The increased use of locked screws in plate constructs has also changed the loading patterns of bone screws. For this study, a novel “toggle-out” testing method was developed to more realistically simulate in-vivo loading of screw-plate constructs. Our objective was to compare the fixation of locked and non-locked screws in simulated cancellous bone of three different densities and to determine the effectiveness of augmentation of the screw fixation using either PMMA or a resorbable Calcium Phosphate cement in both stripped and oversized screw holes. Polyurethane foam blocks of 12. 5, 20, and 30 lb/ft 3 densities representing ostoporotic, normal, and high density cancellous bone respectively (Sawbones, Pacific Research Laboratories, Vashon Island, WA) were used as the bone surrogate for this study. Holes were drilled into the blocks perpendicular to a single face for placement of screws. All screws tested were 4 mm diameter, 32, 34, or 36 mm length stainless steel cancellous bone screws (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ). The holes were either 2. 5 mm <b>diameter</b> <b>pilot</b> holes, 4. 0 mm diameter (to simulate a stripped screw hole), or 12 mm diameter (bone loss / void). In the 4 mm stripped holes and the 12 mm holes, various cements were used to augment the screw fixation. The cements used were PMMA (Simplex, Stryker) and Calcium Phosphate Cement (Trabexus, Vivorté). After placement of the screws or after the cement had set for 24 hours, the blocks were mounted on a load frame (MTS Corp) for cyclic testing. The load fixture allowed screws to be configured either as locked screws or non-locked screws with respect to the plate. Along with cyclic transverse loading, a constant axial pullout force of 20 N was applied to each screw during testing. Cyclic “toggle” loading was applied for 1000 cycles at each of ± 25, ± 50, ± 100, and ± 200 N, or until failure by pullout or screw breakage. The average total displacement (positive and negative combined) value for each test was recorded over the last ten load cycles. Under all conditions, the locked screws exhibited significantly less displacement than the non-locked screws (p screws to be set up as locked screws for half of the test conditions. Locking screws exhibited less displacement than non-locking screws across all test samples (P= 0. 00). This study therefore supports the use of a locking-style cancellous screw in poor quality bone or when cement augmentation of large holes is warranted. The behavior in stripped holes was quite interesting and erratic. The non-locking screws easily pulled out in most cases, but the locking screws were able to survive more cycles. Also, the higher density bone made cement augmentation to prevent pullout more difficult because the cement (especially CaP) does not interdigitate with the high density material. Cement augmentation of large defects and stripped holes in poor quality bone {{has the potential to be}} successful regardless of the type of cement used because locking screws were significantly more stable than non-locking screws...|$|R
40|$|Gas-solid {{fluidized}} bed reactors find many {{applications in the}} energy, chemical and biomedical industries because of their high heat and mass transfer. Their design and optimization {{continue to be a}} challenge; the dependence of mixing dynamics on operating conditions and the impact of the reactor scale are poorly understood. This is compounded by severe limitations on diagnostics in their harsh operating environment. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) will play a pivotal role in advancing this technology since it enables unrestricted access inside the reactor, enhancing fundamental understanding of several coupled phenomena and their interactions at various scales. The thesis is focused on the bubbling fluidization of Geldart B particles (typically 103 <Ar< 105 and 100 <Re< 102) for application to biomass gasification reactors. 3 D CFD simulations are conducted using the Two-Fluid framework, representing the solids phase as a continuum and optimally balancing fidelity and computational needs. To ensure accuracy, critical submodels accounting for unresolved particle-scale interactions (solids stress tensor, particle-gas drag force and particle-wall slip condition) are identified, and computational efficiency gains are achieved through optimal choice of coordinate system, domain discretization and grid resolution. The modeling framework is validated by comparing predictions with experimental measurements spanning a wide range of operating conditions and diagnostic techniques. We performed some of the first fine-grid 3 D simulations of intermediate sized beds (30 - 70 cm diameter) and identified bubbling dynamics and solids circulation as key metrics for characterizing the fluidization hydrodynamics accurately. Towards this end, we developed Multiphase-flow Statistics using 3 D Detection and Tracking Algorithm (MS 3 DATA) to detect and track bubbles using time and spatially resolved data. Our tools are employed to quantify the effect of reactor size on fluidization hydrodynamics. Under similar operating conditions, significantly larger bubbles are observed in small lab-scale beds (~ 10 - 15 cm diameter) because of flow confinement. However, the mechanism for bubble coalescence and growth is consistent across reactor scales: small bubbles are formed near the gas distributor, coalesce and rise laterally towards the bed center forming slugs. The transition to slugging also marks a shift in the dominant solids circulation pattern and is dependent on the bed geometry and excess gas velocity. The analysis conclusively demonstrates that (a) the hydrodynamics are independent of walls only when bubbles are much smaller than reactor dimensions and (b) within the regime of interest, a 50 cm <b>diameter</b> <b>pilot</b> reactor is representative of larger scales. Mixing dynamics are quantified by examining the gas and solids flow-field in and around bubbles. Bubble rise velocity is proportional to the square root of its diameter, while gas flow sufficiently far (~ 30 particle diameters) depends only on the particle properties. Meanwhile, voidage distribution in the vicinity of bubbles results in higher local permeability to gas flow causing (a) preferential bubble pathways, as bubbles are propelled towards areas already frequented by bubbles and (b) gas bypass or throughflow, as low resistance networks are created for interstitial dense-phase gas. Under typical bubbling conditions of Geldart B particles, throughflow almost short circuits through the reactor (residence time is 2 - 3 x shorter than global average) and can reach 30 - 40 % of the total gas flow with detrimental effects on solids mixing and fuel conversion. A predictive model, based on the local bubble-induced micromixing driven by solids upflow around the bubble nose and wake regions and downflow along its sides, has been developed for scaling the gross solids circulation by integrating over the bubble size and spatial distribution. Moreover, reduced models coupling mixing rates (from simulations) and gasification kinetics have been developed and used to analyze thermochemical conversion of biomass. Our CFD approach will be employed for reactive particulate systems in complex reactor geometry, while utilizing discrete element methods to further the fundamental understanding of the hydrodynamics-chemical kinetics coupling, and develop submodels for the continuum framework applications. by Akhilesh Bakshi.

This has been {{due to the fact that}} combustion is the underlying mechanism of several key challenges to modern society: climate change, energy security (finite reserves of fossil fuels) and air pollution. The further development of combustion science is undoubtedly necessary to find improved solutions to manage these combustion science related challenges in the near and long term future. Combustion is essentially an exothermic process, this exothermicity or heat release essentially occurs at small scales, by small scales it meant these scales are small relative to the fluid length scales, for example heat release layer thicknesses in flames are typically much less than the fluid integral length scales. As heat release occurs at small scales this means that in turbulent combustion the small scales of the turbulence (which can be of the order of the heat release layer thickness) can possibly interact and influence the heat release and thus chemistry of the flame reaction zone. Premixed combustion is a combustion mode where the fuel and oxidiser are completely premixed prior to the flame reaction zone, this mode of combustion has been shown to be a promising method to maximise combustion efficiency and minimise pollutant formation. The continued and further application of premixed combustion to practical applications is limited by the current understanding of turbulent premixed combustion, these limitations in understanding are linked to the specific flame phenomena that can significantly influence premixed combustion in a combustion device, examples of such phenomena are: flame flashback, flame extinction and fuel consumption rate – all phenomena that are influenced by the interaction of the small scales of turbulence and chemistry. It is the study and investigation of the interaction of turbulence and chemistry at the small scales (termed finite-rate chemistry) in turbulent premixed flames that is the aim of this thesis which is titled “Finite-rate chemistry effects in turbulent premixed combustion”. Two very closely related experimental burner geometries have been developed in this thesis: the Piloted Premixed Jet Burner (PPJB) and the Premixed Jet Burner (PJB). Both feature an axisymmetric geometry and exhibit a parabolic like flow field. The PPJB and PJB feature a small 4 mm diameter central jet from which a high velocity lean-premixed methane-air mixture issues. Surrounding the central jet in the PPJB is a 23. 5 mm <b>diameter</b> <b>pilot</b> of stoichiometric methane-air products, the major difference between the PPJB and the PJB is that the PJB does not feature a stoichiometric pilot. The pilot in the PPJB provides a rich source of combustion intermediates and enthalpy which promotes initial ignition of the central jet mixture. Surrounding both the central jet and pilot is a large diameter hot coflow of combustion products. It is possible to set the temperature of the hot coflow to the adiabatic flame temperature of the central jet mixture to simulate straining and mixing against and with combustion products without introducing complexities such as quenching and dilution from cold air. By parametrically increasing the central jet velocity in the PPJB it is possible to show that there is a transition from a thin conical flame brush to a flame that exhibits extinction and re-ignition effects. The flames that exhibit extinction and re-ignition effects have a luminous region near the jet exit termed the initial ignition region. This is followed by a region of reduced luminosity further downstream termed the extinction region. Further downstream the flame luminosity increases this region is termed the re-ignition region. For the flames that exhibit extinction and re-ignition it is proposed that intense turbulent mixing and high scalar dissipation rates drives the initial extinction process after the influence of the pilot has ceased (x/D> 10). Re-ignition is proposed to occur downstream where turbulent mixing and scalar dissipation rates have decreased allowing robust combustion to continue. As the PJB does not feature a pilot, the flame stabilisation structure is quite different to the PPJB. The flame structure in the PJB is essentially a lifted purely premixed flame, which is an experimental configuration that is also quite unique. A suite of laser diagnostic measurements has been parametrically applied to flames in the PPJB and PJB. Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) has been utilised to measure the mean and fluctuating radial and axial components of velocity at a point, with relevant time and length scale information being extracted from these measurements. One of the most interesting results from the LDV measurements is that in the PPJB the pilot delays the generation of high turbulence intensities, for flames that exhibit extinction the rapid increase of turbulence intensity after the pilot corresponds to the start of the extinction region. Using the LDV derived turbulence characteristics and laminar flame properties and plotting these flames on a traditional turbulent regime diagram indicates that all of the flames examined should fall in the so call distributed reaction regime. Planar imaging experiments have been conducted for flames using the PPJB and PJB to investigate the spatial structure of the temperature and selected minor species fields. Results from two different simultaneous 2 D Rayleigh and OH PLIF experiments and a simultaneous 2 D Rayleigh, OH PLIF and CH 2 O PLIF experiment are reported. For all of the flames examined in the PPJB and PJB a general trend of decreasing conditional mean temperature gradient with increasing turbulence intensity is observed. This indicates that a trend of so called flame front thickening with increased turbulence levels occurs for the flames examined. It is proposed that the mechanism for this flame front thickening is due to eddies penetrating and embedding in the instantaneous flame front. In the extinction region it is found that the OH concentration is significantly reduced compared to the initial ignition region. In the re-ignition region it is found that the OH level increases again indicating that an increase in the local reaction rate is occurring. In laminar premixed flames CH 2 O occurs in a thin layer in the reaction zone, it is found for all of the flames examined that the CH 2 O layer is significantly thicker than the laminar flame. For the high velocity flames beyond x/D= 15, CH 2 O no longer exist in a distinct layer but rather in a near uniform field for the intermediate temperature regions. Examination of the product of CH 2 O and OH reveals that the heat release in the initial ignition region is high and rapidly decreases in the extinction region, an increase in the heat release further downstream is observed corresponding to the re-ignition region. This finding corresponds well with the initial hypothesis of an extinction region followed by a re-ignition region that was based on the mean chemiluminescence images. Detailed simultaneous measurement of major and minor species has been conducted using the line Raman-Rayleigh-LIF technique with CO LIF and crossed plane-OH PLIF at Sandia National Laboratories. By measuring all major species it is also possible to define a mixture fraction for all three streams of the PPJB. Using these three mixture fractions it was found that the influence of the pilot in the PPJB decays very rapidly for all but the lowest velocity flames. It was also found that for the high velocity flames exhibiting extinction, a significant proportion of the coflow fluid is entrained into the central jet combustion process at both the extinction region and re-ignition regions. The product of CO and OH conditional on temperature is shown to be proportion to the net production rate of CO 2 for certain temperature ranges. By examining the product of CO and OH the hypothesis of an initial ignition region followed by an extinction region then a re-ignition region for certain PPJB flames has been further validated complementing the [CH 2 O][OH] imaging results. Numerical modelling results using the transported composition probability density function (TPDF) method coupled to a conventional Reynolds averaged Naiver Stokes (RANS) solver are shown in this thesis to successfully predict the occurrence of finite-rate chemistry effects for the PM 1 PPJB flame series. To calculate the scalar variance and the degree of finite-rate chemistry effects correctly, it is found that a value of the mixing constant () of approximately 8. 0 is required. This value of is much larger than the standard excepted range of 1. 5 - 2. 3 for that has been established for non-premixed combustion. By examining the results of the RANS turbulence model in a non-reacting variable density jet, it is shown that the primary limitation of the predictive capability of the TPDF-RANS method is the RANS turbulence model when applied to variable density flows...|$|R
