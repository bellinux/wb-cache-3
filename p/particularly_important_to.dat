5|$|Henry's wealth {{allowed him}} to {{maintain}} what was probably the largest curia regis, or royal court, in Europe. His court attracted huge attention from contemporary chroniclers, and typically comprised {{a number of major}} nobles and bishops, along with knights, domestic servants, prostitutes, clerks, horses and hunting dogs. Within the court were his officials, ministeriales, his friends, amici, and the familiares regis, the king's informal inner circle of confidants and trusted servants. Henry's familiares were <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the operation of his household and government, driving government initiatives and filling the gaps between the official structures and the king.|$|E
5|$|In Vaishnavism Hindu theology, Kanchipuram {{is one of}} {{the seven}} Tirtha (pilgrimage) sites, for spiritual release. The city houses Varadharaja Perumal Temple, Ekambareswarar Temple, Kamakshi Amman Temple, and Kumarakottam Temple which are some of major Hindu temples in the state. Of the 108 holy temples of the Hindu god Vishnu, 14 are located in Kanchipuram. The town is <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Sri Vaishnavism, but is also a holy pilgrimage site in Shaivism. The town is well known for its hand woven silk sarees and most of the town's {{workforce}} is involved in the weaving industry.|$|E
5|$|Natural ice {{typically}} had to {{be moved}} several times between being harvested and used by the end customer. A wide range of methods were used, including wagons, railroads, ships and barges. Ships were <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the ice trade, particularly in the early phase of the trade, when {{the focus of the}} trade was on international exports from the U.S. and railroad networks across the country were non-existent.|$|E

5|$|On February 15, 2008, it was {{announced}} that the pro-Western Boris Tadić won the 2008 Serbian presidential election. The 2008 elections were <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Serbia's relations with the United States, as the main challenging party which lost the election, SRS, disintegrated when Tomislav Nikolić split with Vojislav Šešelj over integration into the European Union. When Nikolić split from SRS and began pursuing a pro-European profile (a reversal from SRS's eurosceptic position), he was being advised by American lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie & Associates.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} of Somerset there is an upland {{with a series of}} rolling valleys and scarps, from Penselwood in the east to the Blackdown Hills, another {{designated}} Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in the west. This is a geologically complex area of clays, limestone and marl. The honey-coloured limestone at Ham Hill (also known as Hamdon Hill) is <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> geologists because of the assemblages of fossils which it contains, the sedimentary features which it displays and the way it relates to other rocks of equivalent age in the close vicinity. It has been quarried since Roman times at least.|$|E
5|$|As Master of the Rolls he {{selected}} cases he {{felt to be}} <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> hear and, rather than having an American system (where judges had a rota for taking cases), assigned cases to those judges who had expertise in that particular area of law. In 1963 he chaired a committee investigating {{ways to reduce the}} archive of legal documents kept by the Public Record Office; by that point the files for civil cases of the High Court alone occupied four miles of shelving. The final report was presented to the Lord Chancellor on 16 May 1966, with the conclusion being that 'if our proposals are implemented the Public Record Office alone will be relieved of two hundred tons of records (occupying 15,000 feet of shelving)'. The Lord Chancellor took Denning's report to heart, and had the changes he recommended implemented immediately.|$|E
30|$|The {{aforementioned}} {{findings suggest}} that contextual factors are <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> when analyzing liquidity improvements’ effects on turnaround success. Scholars’ models do not always clearly distinguish a firm’s health, hence impeding a summarization of the results between different studies. Additionally, a regional legislative framework is <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> relative <b>to</b> creditor protection rights.|$|R

5|$|Henry {{inherited}} {{the kingdom of}} England from William Rufus, giving him a claim of suzerainty over Wales and Scotland, and acquired the Duchy of Normandy, a complex entity with troubled borders. The borders between England and Scotland were still uncertain during Henry's reign, with Anglo-Norman influence pushing northwards through Cumbria, but Henry's relationship with King David I of Scotland was generally good, partially due to Henry's marriage to his sister. In Wales, Henry used his power to coerce and charm the indigenous Welsh princes, while Norman Marcher Lords pushed across the valleys of South Wales. Normandy was controlled via various interlocking networks of ducal, ecclesiastical and family contacts, backed by a growing string of important ducal castles along the borders. Alliances and relationships with neighbouring counties along the Norman border were <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> maintaining {{the stability of the}} Duchy.|$|E
5|$|Evidence from {{microelectrode}} recordings {{from the}} brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by {{a wide variety of}} rewarding events. These reward-responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are crucial for reward-related cognition and serve as the central component of the reward system.The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner....The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and hedonic evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}} The function of dopamine varies in each axonal projection from the VTA and substantia nigra; for example, the VTA–nucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience ("want") to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues, the VTA–orbitofrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in accordance with their incentive salience, the VTA–amygdala and VTA–hippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward-related memories, and both the VTA–nucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra–dorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli. Some activity within the VTA dopaminergic projections appears to be associated with reward prediction as well.|$|E

5000|$|More recently, analysts of {{its use in}} {{conversation}} have argued that it functions not by making an event present, but by marking segments of a narrative, foregrounding events (that is, signalling that one event is <b>particularly</b> <b>important,</b> relative <b>to</b> others) and marking a shift to evaluation (Brinton 1992: 221).|$|R
25|$|Though the Beat {{aesthetic}} posited {{itself against}} author T. S. Eliot's creed of strict objectivity and literary modernism's new classicism, a few modernist writers were major {{influences on the}} Beats, including Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, and H.D.. Pound was <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg..|$|E
25|$|Several small dinosaurs {{from the}} Jurassic or Early Cretaceous, all with feathers, have been {{interpreted}} as possibly having arboreal and/or aerodynamic adaptations. These include Scansoriopteryx, Epidexipteryx, Microraptor, Pedopenna, and Anchiornis. Anchiornis is <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> this subject, as it {{lived at the}} beginning of the Late Jurassic, long before Archaeopteryx.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous Australians have {{inhabited}} the Perth area for 38,000 years, {{as evidenced by}} archaeological remains at Upper Swan. The Noongar people occupied {{the southwest corner of}} Western Australia and lived as hunter-gatherers. The wetlands on the Swan Coastal Plain were <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> them, both spiritually (featuring in local mythology) and as a source of food.|$|E
50|$|The {{directness}} {{with which}} Austen addresses the reader, {{especially at the}} end of the story, gives a unique insight into Austen's thoughts at the time, which is <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> due <b>to</b> the fact that a large portion of her letters were burned, at her request, by her sister upon her death.|$|R
50|$|According to SEC filings, ECD Ovonics and Cobasys hold 125 US patents {{related to}} NiMH battery technology. 13 of the patents, {{considered}} <b>particularly</b> <b>important,</b> are due <b>to</b> expire by 2014.|$|R
50|$|Banana {{and coconut}} are <b>particularly</b> <b>important,</b> not only <b>to</b> Indonesian cuisine, {{but also in}} other uses, such as timber, bedding, roofing, oil, plates and {{packaging}}. Banana leaf and janur (young coconut leaf) are <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> for packaging and cooking process, employed to make pepes, lontong and ketupat.|$|R
25|$|The {{open spaces}} of airfields were very {{vulnerable}} to attack by airborne troops {{and it was}} felt that it was <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> defend them effectively. However, conventional defences such as pillboxes and trenches could not be installed without danger to friendly aircraft. At this time a number of private companies contacted the government with their own design ideas.|$|E
25|$|This was <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, {{who was at}} {{that time}} engaged in the Atlanta campaign. Because Mobile {{remained}} unconquered the significance of Farragut's victory initially had little effect on Northern public opinion. As time passed and a sequence of other Union victories seemed to show that the war was winding down, the battle began to loom larger.|$|E
25|$|Because a large {{proportion}} of stars exist in binary systems, binaries are <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> our understanding of the processes by which stars form. In particular, the period and masses of the binary tell us about the amount of angular momentum in the system. Because this is a conserved quantity in physics, binaries give us important clues about the conditions under which the stars were formed.|$|E
50|$|De Groot concurred with Alfred Binet that {{visual memory}} and visual {{perception}} are important attributors and that problem-solving ability is of paramount importance. Memory is <b>particularly</b> <b>important,</b> according <b>to</b> de Groot (1965) {{in that there}} are no ‘new’ moves in chess and, so those from personal experience or, from the experience of others can be committed to memory.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Ashton {{appointed}} a Polish security operative {{to head a}} working group designing the security architecture of the EEAS; particularly the physical security of the EEAS building and its communication network with its embassies.

50|$|There is a <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> {{distinction}} <b>to</b> be {{made between}} legacies and inheritances. This distinction {{plays an important role}} in the final distribution of an estate. The estate of a deceased person is distributed by the executor by first paying the debts, then handing over the legacies and prelegacies, and finally giving the balance to the heir or heirs.|$|R
25|$|Non-verbal {{behaviors}} are <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> forming first impressions when meeting a business acquaintance. Specifically, components of social expressivity, such as smiling, eyebrow position, emotional expression, and eye contact are emphasized. Straightening one's posture, leaning in slightly, and giving a firm handshake promotes favorable impression {{formation in the}} American business context. Other impression management tactics {{in the business world}} include researching the organization and interviewers beforehand, preparing specific questions for the interviewer, showing confidence, and dressing appropriately.|$|E
25|$|The borough's largest {{employment}} sector—trade, transportation, and utilities—accounted {{for nearly}} 30% of all jobs in 2004. Queens {{is home to}} two of the three major New York City area airports, JFK International Airport and LaGuardia Airport. These airports are among the busiest in the world, leading the airspace above Queens to be the most congested in the country. This airline industry is <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the economy of Queens, providing almost one quarter of the sector's employment and more than 30% of the sector's wages.|$|E
25|$|At outdoor pow wows, this {{circle is}} often covered by either a committee-built arbor or tent, or each group, {{particularly}} the MC and the drums, will provide their own. While {{most of the}} time, a tent provides shelter from the sun, rain can also plague outdoor events. It is <b>particularly</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> protect the drums used by the drum groups, as they are sensitive to temperature changes and, if it rains, they cannot get wet. Most vendors provide their own tents or shelters at an outdoor pow wow.|$|E
