40|$|The {{compulsive}} behaviors seen {{in sexual}} paraphilias {{may be related}} to those of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Based primarily upon case reports as well as studies indicating the effectiveness of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatm ent of sexual paraph ilias, it has been speculated that sexual paraphilias lie within the obsessive-com pulsive spectrum. There have been no reports of the use of paroxetine in the treatment of sexual paraph ilias. This is a report of two patients, the first a voyeur and the second an exhibitionist, bo th of whom respon ded to treatm ent with <b>paroxetin</b> e. The discussion addresses the need for further comparative studies investigating the role of the serotonin system in the pathogen esis of sexual paraphilias and OCD as well as th e effect of seroton in reuptake in h ibito rs in com pariso n to oth er pharm acologic modalities used in the treatment of paraphilias.

40|$|KEY MESSAGES: Efficacy {{and safety}} for the newer {{antidepressants}} in adults Background Depression is a varied illness, patients may present with {{symptoms such as}} lack of initiative, a sense of meaninglessness, depressive thoughts and/or suicidal behaviour. Problems with sleep, lack of appetite, energy, drive, anxiety and concentration are also common. Our understanding of the neurobiological causes of depression is incomplete. Reduced accessibility of monoaminerge neurotransmitters in the central nervous systems is one possible explanation. Several antidepressant drugs are available. SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and other second generation anti depressants have been increasingly used in recent years. Antidepressants increase the accessibility of serotonin and/or noradrenalin, either by inhibiting the reuptake or inhibiting the decomposition. This {{does not seem to}} explain the effect. Methods We have systematically reviewed the literature for effect and safety in head-tohead studies of SSRI and other second generation antidepressants used in adults with depression. The literature was identified by a systematic search in international, electronic databases. We also received literature from the pharmaceutical industry. We assessed and summarised studies that fulfilled our predetermined criteria. Results 23 studies are included in the report. The 23 studies deal with 12 different comparisons out of 66 possible. Nine different antidepressants were compared. The documentation is of low quality for most of the comparisons. We did not find any differences in effect and safety in the head-to-head studies we analyzed with the exception of: Escitalopram was significantly more effective (response and remission rate) than citalopram. Loss to follow up was significantly lower for escitalopram than for citalopram. Citalopram had a significantly lower adverse event rate than venlafaxin. Mirtazapin was significantly more effective (remission rate) than <b>paroxetin.</b> Loss to follow up due to side effects was significantly lower for fluoksetin than for venlafaxin.. Conclusion We have included 12 different head-to head comparisons out of 66 possible. Nine different antidepressants were involved in the comparisons. We did not find any significant differences in effect and safety between the antidepressants except for the comparisons escitalopram versus citalopram, citalopram versus venlafaxin and mirtazapin versus <b>paroxetin</b> where we found significant differences for some of the outcomes. The conclusions are based on documentation of medium or low quality...|$|E
40|$|The 5 -HT uptake {{sites were}} studied with [3 H] {{paroxetine}} as radioligand in frontal cortex, cingulate cortex and hypothalamus from {{a control group}} (n= 22) {{and a group of}} suicide victims (n = 19). The binding was also analysed with regard to the method of suicide (violent or non-violent) and history of depressive symptoms. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) was the same, 0. 07 - 0. 10 nM, and did not differ between the two groups studied. The maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) for the controls were frontal cortex 112 &plusmn; 21, cingulate gyrus 227 &plusmn; 92 and hypothalamus 699 &plusmn; 240 fmol/mg protein. The Bmax values for the suicide group were not {{different from those of the}} control group. When the binding parameters were analysed according to the method of suicide (violent or non-violent) there were no differences in comparison to the control group or between these two suicide groups. Similarly, suicides with and without history of depression did not differ in [3 H] paroxetine binding and were not different from the control group. The control and suicide groups were not different with respect to age and post-mortem storage time. Considering 5 -HT uptake sites as indirect markers for 5 -HT terminals, these data suggest that the 5 -HT terminal system is intact in the neocortex, the limbic system and in the hypothalamus in suicide victims.

40|$|Major {{depression}} increases cardiovascular risk despite {{lower cholesterol}} levels. Little {{is known about}} effects of antidepressants on metabolic risk factors. We studied lipoprotein composition, insulin sensitivity (quantitative insulin sensitivity check index), and saliva cortisol in 78 depressed patients before and after 35 days of amitriptyline or <b>paroxetin</b> treatment. Data were analyzed by principal component factor analyses and analysis of variance (ANOVA). At baseline, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index was inversely correlated with cortisol (r = - 0. 46; P = 0. 005) in normal weight patients, with body mass index in overweight patients (r = - 0. 50; P < 0. 001). In overweight patients, hypercortisolemia correlated inversely with total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (eg, cortisol at 4 : 00 PM and low density lipoprotein cholesterol: r = - 0. 49, P = 0. 002). After treatment, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index was unchanged. Triglycerides increased in responders to amitriptyline only (P < 0. 05). Parameters of cholesterol metabolism improved slightly without differences between treatment groups (eg, high density lipoprotein: pre 43. 5 +/- 12. 0; post 47. 6 +/- 13. 0 mg/dL; P = 0. 01; low density lipoprotein triglycerides, a measure of low density lipoprotein atherogenicity: pre 458 +/- 120; post 415 +/- 130 mg/g; P < 0, 01). The inverse correlation of cortisol and cholesterol, {{at least in the}} obese subgroup, proposes a mechanism for the known association of depression with low cholesterol. As determinants of plasma lipids in major depression, we identified body mass index, insulin sensitivity, and cortisol. Although uncontrolled, our data suggest that treatment of depression exerts a mainly beneficial effect on lipid regulation...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{appraise}} {{the evidence for}} comparative efficacy and tolerability of drug treatments in patients with generalised anxiety disorder. Design: systematic review of randomised controlled trials. Primary Bayesian probabilistic mixed treatment meta-analyses allowed pharmacological treatments to be ranked for effectiveness for each outcome measure, given as percentage probability of being the most effective treatment. Secondary frequentist mixed treatment meta-analyses conducted with random effects model; effect size reported as odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval. Data sources: Medline, Embase, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, Health Economic Evaluations Database, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects via DataStar, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library (January 1980 to February 2009). Eligibility criteria: double blind placebo controlled randomised controlled trials; published systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Randomised controlled trials including adult participants (aged ? 18) receiving any pharmacological treatment for generalised anxiety disorder. Data abstraction methods: titles or abstracts reviewed initially, followed by review of full text publications for citations remaining after first pass. A three person team conducted screening; an independent reviewer checked a random selection (10 %) of articles screened. Data extracted for meta-analysis were also independently reviewed. Main outcome measures: proportion of participants experiencing ? 50 % reduction from baseline score on Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A) (response), proportion with final HAM-A score ? 7 (remission), proportion withdrawing from trial because of adverse events (tolerability). Results: the review identified 3249 citations, and 46 randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria; 27 trials contained sufficient or appropriate data {{for inclusion in the}} analysis. Analyses compared nine drugs (duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, lorazepam, paroxetine, pregabalin, sertraline, tiagabine, and venlafaxine). In the primary probabilistic mixed treatment meta-analyses, fluoxetine was ranked first for response and remission (probability of 62. 9 % and 60. 6 %, respectively) and sertraline was ranked first for tolerability (49. 3 %). In a subanalysis ranking treatments for generalised anxiety disorder currently licensed in the United Kingdom, duloxetine was ranked first for response (third across all treatments; 2. 7 %), escitalopram was ranked first for remission (second across all treatments; 26. 7 %), and pregabalin was ranked first for tolerability (second across all treatments; 7. 7 %). Conclusions: though the frequentist analysis was inconclusive because of a high level of uncertainty in effect sizes (based on the relatively small number of comparative trials), the probabilistic analysis, which did not rely on significant outcomes, showed that fluoxetine (in terms of response and remission) and sertraline (in terms of tolerability) seem to have some advantages over other treatments. Among five UK licensed treatments, duloxetine, escitalopram, and pregabalin might offer some advantages over venlafaxine and <b>paroxetin...</b>|$|E
