In September 2011, however, the postal service announced that, in an attempt to increase flagging revenues, stamps would soon offer images of celebrated living persons, chosen by the Committee in response to suggestions submitted by the public via surface mail and social networks on the Internet.

40|$|Delivery of <b>postal</b> <b>items</b> is {{the last}} phase in the postal {{conveyance}} process. This phase involved up to 57 % in total costs of <b>postal</b> <b>items</b> conveyance. In {{order to reduce the}} costs of delivery phase, postal organizations apply different methods and techniques. Legal and technological regulations, various restrictions regarding the selection and deployment of employees influence the choice of appropriate methods. Also, the principle of availability of the universal postal service is an essential factor in defining the optimal model. In this paper, the model for assessing and planning of the number of employees in the delivery service observed postal operator has been proposed, with respect to the principles of productivity and accessibility constraints of the universal postal service. This paper will analyze the impact of daily fluctuations in the number of full-time employees and the possibility of hiring a part-time workers in the days with increased traffic volume in the delivery of items, when usually the items from large customers are delivered...|$|R

The aim is to develop the project "Electronic Registry", which can be implemented into current information systems of the company and which will contribute to the optimization of processes of the registry. To achieve this objective it was developed an extensive analysis of the current state of registry and records management system in E. ON Czech Republic. Based on analysis it was proposed a specific solution for improvement. The first part {{deals with the}} analysis of current legislative requirements and theoretical analysis of the document lifecycle, which is demonstrated on the example of E.

ON Czech Republic, which is followed by description of the current state of registry and processes in relation to the rece-iving of <b>postal</b> <b>items.</b> In the analysis of the current situation there are identified issues that arise when receiving and processing <b>postal</b> <b>items</b> to the registry. To the identified problems are offered individual solutions, which are elaborated in the overall solution in the final part of the thesis.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to propose the process of {{delivering}} <b>postal</b> <b>items</b> by using general knowledge of the travelling salesman problem. The first part briefly describes the historical evolution concentrating on solving real problems. The second part describes the travelling salesman problem and the multiple travelling salesman problem. Emphasis is placed on heuristic algorithms, primarily on the nearest neighbour algorithm. Various modifications of the travelling salesman problems are also mentioned. In {{the part of the}} application a real problem of delivering <b>postal</b> <b>items</b> in a given area is handled in order to minimize the total time spend on delivery. For this specific type of problem a mathematical model is design as well as its possible modification for minimizing the earliest possible time of vehicle's arrival to the village. For the optimization, computer software MPL and Lingo are used. Interim results of these calculations are described in detail. Due to the complexity of the calculation the modified nearest neighbour algorithm is suggested. Its process is programmed in MATLAB software and is described in detail. In this thesis the intention of reducing the coefficient of the limit in MATLAB is also presented and then these results are applied. In the conclusion the results of heuristic algorithms are carefully analysed and compared with interim results of MPL...|$|R
