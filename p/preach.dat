40|$|PhD, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{ascertain}} to what extent D. T. Niles’ theory of <b>preaching</b> is Reformed and Biblical and can help in the dialogue between Western and Non-Western Christianity. The study achieves this aim by employing the qualitative case-study research to meet four objectives. First, it describes Niles’ theory of <b>preaching</b> as found in his trilogy of lectures on <b>preaching,</b> explicating especially the double calling of the preacher, the double content and the pneumatological character and nature of <b>preaching,</b> the three-fold purpose and double consequences of <b>preaching.</b> Second, it interprets Niles’ theory of <b>preaching</b> {{in the light of}} his own cultural background and in dialogue with the works of key Reformation figures including Erasmus, Zwingli, Luther, Calvin and Bullinger’s Second Helvetic Confession. Based on this examination, the study determines that Niles’ homiletical theory is in concert with the theology of <b>preaching</b> of the Magisterial Reformers as summarised in Bullinger’s classic statement: ‘The <b>preaching</b> of the word of God is the word of God’. Third, this study evaluates critically Niles’ theory of <b>preaching</b> within the normative context of the <b>preaching</b> of Jesus in the Synagogue in Nazareth and the wider New Testament teaching on <b>preaching</b> and finds that Niles’ homiletical theory is in agreement with Scriptural norm. Fourth, having found Niles’ theory of <b>preaching</b> to be broadly in concert with the understanding of the Reformers and the Biblical teaching on the nature of <b>preaching,</b> this study undertakes the pragmatic task of developing a global theology of <b>preaching</b> that would promote dialogue between Western and Non-Western Christianity. This study was undertaken because of the dearth of theologies of <b>preaching</b> written from a Non-Western perspective and the lack of dialogue between Western and Non-Western homiletical theories. The result of the investigation is the conclusion that the <b>preaching</b> of the word of God is the word of God since <b>preaching</b> is a pneumatological event where God is present in the act of human <b>preaching</b> so long as the preacher himself is lawfully called and the content of his <b>preaching</b> is Christological and soteriological.

5|$|Despite {{questions}} about his income, no scandal ever touched Sunday. He was sincerely devoted to his wife, who also managed his campaigns, but his three sons disappointed him.

Nevertheless, Sunday continued to <b>preach</b> and remained a stalwart defender of conservative Christianity until his death.|$|E
5|$|During his {{ministry}} in Geneva, Calvin preached over two thousand sermons. Initially he preached twice on Sunday {{and three times}} during the week. This proved to be too heavy a burden and late in 1542 the council allowed him to <b>preach</b> only once on Sunday. In October 1549, he was again required to <b>preach</b> twice on Sundays and, in addition, every weekday of alternate weeks. His sermons lasted {{more than an hour}} and he did not use notes. An occasional secretary tried to record his sermons, but very little of his preaching was preserved before 1549. In that year, professional scribe Denis Raguenier, who had learned or developed a system of shorthand, was assigned to record all of Calvin's sermons. An analysis of his sermons by T.H.L.Parker suggests that Calvin was a consistent preacher and his style changed very little over the years. John Calvin was also known for his thorough manner of working his way through the Bible in consecutive sermons. From March 1555 to July 1556, Calvin delivered two hundred sermons on Deuteronomy.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{diversity}} of Pentecostalism has produced questions regarding appropriate methods for Pentecostal <b>preaching.</b> Increasing educational levels among Pentecostal pastors have caused many of them to move to more mainline Protestant approaches to <b>preaching.</b> This article, although allowing for diverse models of <b>preaching,</b> calls for an appreciation of Pentecostal approaches to <b>preaching</b> and suggests the appropriation of a biblical model of prophetic <b>preaching.</b> A paradigm for prophetic <b>preaching</b> emerges through an examination of biblical prophetic ministry as it intersects with Pentecostal practice. It is suggested that a contemporary model of Pentecostal prophetic <b>preaching</b> can be informed by the biblical models. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: This study suggests intersections between biblical studies, historical theology, homiletics, and contemporary culture. It is argued that Pentecostal <b>preaching</b> should be based upon biblical models, while taking into consideration historical and cultural contexts. This work integrates the disciplines of biblical studies, practical theology, homiletics, and Pentecostal worship studies. Results from the biblical study of the prophets suggest that contemporary Pentecostal homiletical theory should entertain a model of prophetic <b>preaching</b> that emulates the goals and methods of the biblical prophets. The Pentecostal <b>preaching</b> tradition continues to offer valuable insights into effective <b>preaching</b> models; therefore, Pentecostal homiletics should not be based entirely upon western Protestant models of <b>preaching.</b> Keyword: Preaching; Homiletics; Pentecostalism; Prophecy</p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine {{the ways in}} which {{analysing}} open-air <b>preaching</b> as ‘radical street performance’ can inform our understanding of this expression of Christian <b>preaching.</b> Open-air <b>preaching</b> is commonly associated with negative stereotypes. Most contemporary homiletical writers also largely neglect considering this practice. Through my research, I posit radical street performance as a constructive and illuminating way to understand and analyse open-air <b>preaching.</b> In chapter 1, I introduce the practice of open-air <b>preaching</b> in relation to relevant homiletical literature. In so doing, I challenge the commonly held stereotypes about open-air <b>preaching.</b> I do so with reference to the long and diverse nature of the practice. In chapter 2, I critically analyse existing ‘preaching as performance’ literature. I first demonstrate {{the ways in which}} these authors show the suitability of performance as a concept for understanding <b>preaching.</b> I then go on to consider the limitations of their understandings of <b>preaching</b> as performance for exploring open-air <b>preaching</b> in performance terms. I do this to establish the immediate theoretical context for my own research. In chapter 3, I develop this argument further drawing on the work of performance theorists Jan Cohen-Cruz and Baz Kershaw. I argue accordingly, that radical street performance is a valuable way of understanding and analysing open-air <b>preaching</b> as performance. On the basis of these theoretical and methodological foundations, in chapters 4 - 6, I explore three case studies of open-air <b>preaching</b> according to this analytical approach. In chapter 4, I focus on the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century evangelical <b>preaching</b> of James Haldane (1768 - 1851), whose open-air <b>preaching</b> was directly related to his move to congregational Independency. In chapter 5, I explore the early to mid twentieth century open-air <b>preaching</b> of George MacLeod (1895 - 1991), founder of the Iona Community. In chapter 6, I analyse the open-air <b>preaching</b> of OAC Ministries GB, a contemporary organisation that seeks to promote and practice open-air <b>preaching</b> in a creative way. The outcomes of the original research in chapters 4, 5, and 6 demonstrate the applicability and versatility of radical street performance as a way of understanding and analysing open-air <b>preaching</b> in performance terms. It also provides original understandings of the dynamics of each example of open-air <b>preaching</b> examined, highlighting differences and similarities between them. In chapter 7, I draw together by way of conclusions, the theoretical, theological, and practical outcomes of the research for the practice of open-air <b>preaching</b> and the consequent implications for in-church <b>preaching.</b> In this way I present open-air <b>preaching</b> as a minority but significant practice of incarnational witness which exists in a tensive relationship with the dominant practice of in-church <b>preaching.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (ThM) [...] PU for CHE, 1999 The {{subject of}} this study is the preacher and his <b>preaching</b> {{attitude}} according to the Pastoral Epistles. The following aspects are addressed: • Basistheoretical perspectives on preacher and <b>preaching</b> attitude • Meta-theoretical perspectives on preacher and <b>preaching</b> attitude. • Practice-theoretical perspectives on preacher and <b>preaching</b> atitude. It is attempted to achieve the intended goal by investigating Word <b>preaching</b> concepts from the Pastoral Letters to which six attitudes are attached. The attitudes are divided in three groups: • Attitudes concerning the earnestness and zeal of <b>preaching.</b> • Attitudes concerning the content of <b>preaching.</b> • Attitudes concerning the manner and method of <b>preaching.</b> The attitudes named above are: <b>Preaching</b> in a non-overwhelming attitude, <b>preaching</b> in a attitude of honesty and virtuousness, <b>preaching</b> in an attitude of patience, <b>preaching</b> in sound doctrine, <b>preaching</b> with full authority and <b>preaching</b> in the attitude of faith and truth. Four concepts that are connected directly to the preacher are indicated: preacher, apostle, teacher and evangelist. Four metaphors are indicated: manager, soldier, athlete and farmer which in tum emphasize three attitudes: irreproachability, self-denial as well as an attitude of willingness. Per definition <b>preaching</b> attitude deals with a given way of thinking, feeling and a way of behaviour and proceeding in the action of <b>preaching.</b> The attitude of the preacher is emphasized by certain indicated qualities affecting the preacher's person, character and performance. The correct <b>preaching</b> attitude is cultivated and developed in a continuous relationship with God. Spirituality as religious orientation of the preacher gives direction to the practice of attitude. Meta-theoreretical perspectives from the science of behaviourism are exploited. From the Social Psychology as well as Communication Science the forming of attitudes, the influence of attitudes upon behaviour, as well as the changing of attitudes are discussed. It is indicated that people influence each other. It is therefore essential that preachers ascertain their own <b>preaching</b> attitude by means of continuous self- examination. Practice-theoretical perspectives as the outcome of the hermeneutical interaction between the exploited basictheoretical and metatheoretical perspectives are presented. Along with this, concretizing perspectives are aimed at the preacher's attitude, the preparation of sermons (prayer, exegesis and hermeneusis), the presentation of sermons, the discussion of the sermon as well as critisism on sermons and their presentation are indicated. The aim of the study is to identify preacher and <b>preaching</b> attitude {{in the light of the}} Pastoral Letters in order to establish perspectives aimed at the praxis. Master...|$|R
