500|$|The press-boxes of Kilburn's time, {{particularly}} in Yorkshire, were unfriendly and serious places. According to Wisden, [...] " [...] was a tall, austere {{man who had}} little truck with <b>press-box</b> banter." [...] According to writer Derek Hodgson, Kilburn was shy. However, his views and methods were regarded as old-fashioned in the later stages of his career. Kilburn was often compared to his contemporary from Lancashire, Neville Cardus, but his style was dissimilar. Cardus wrote in a romantic style whereas Kilburn preferred factual accuracy; according to Wisden, Kilburn was [...] "harder, less flashy, more punctilious". Journalist Frank Keating writes: [...] "Neville Cardus was acclaimed the Wordsworth of cricket writing, while across the Pennines they hailed Kilburn as the Coleridge. With good reason." [...] Kilburn's writings on the Yorkshire players of the 1930s and 1940s made them well-known {{to the public as}} personalities, and he wrote several pieces for the Yorkshire Post which became famous. Kilburn had a deep love of cricket, and worried it was losing its way in embracing one-day matches and sponsorship, although he did not believe that progress was necessarily bad. He believed that cricketers should be chivalrous, and greatly admired stylish play. He severely criticised anything on the field which he believed fell short of acceptable standards, including the occasion in 1967 when Yorkshire won the County Championship after engaging in time-wasting tactics to avoid losing a game. He retired in 1976, but continued to follow the sport very closely.|$|E

5000|$|Thirlby Field {{originally}} ran {{north and}} south along Pine Street when play began in 1896. Mr. Thirlby, a local farmer gave the land to the Traverse City Schools for athletic contests. In the early years it was known as Thirlby's farm fields, or 12th Street Athletic Field. The current configuration was originally built in 1934 {{and was one of}} the first lighted athletic fields in Northern Michigan. The stadium seated 5,000 until 1995 and is the only football stadium in Traverse City. Seating was enlarged to approx 7,000 at that time. Improvements to the stadium including the addition of locker rooms, public bathrooms, and an elevator to the <b>press-box</b> were made in 2009.How the modern Facility had its beginnings...In 1993 a small and dedicated group of former football players of Traverse City High School got together and planned, designed and tried to execute a completely new facility for the 13th and Pine Street location. Harry Running left a few hundred thousand dollars specifically for Thrilby Field renovations. It was a kick-start to getting going. The group that formed to tackle the mission was originally called Between The Fences, in reference to all the memorable games played at the stadium between the white rail fence that lines the field. A Plan to take the stadium back to its original 'north-south' layout and lower it in the ground on the Pine Street side was put forth. Three persons highly dedicated (one of which made the initial phone calls that invigorated the team) were the driving force behind this effort that lead the charge for new and classic facilities to serve the entire community. As a neighborhood icon, [...] "Thirlby" [...] (as it is known throughout the state of Michigan) was to have state-of-the-art seating and lighting. With the field lowered some 30-40 ft into the ground to make the top of the stadium at ground level. It was a true wonder; designed by a professional conceptual designer who is a former Traverse City Trojan Football player and graduate of the College of Creative Studies along with the assistance of another former Trojan Football player and product developer that headed up the group; (both were members of the original [...] "3") along with a get things done former player and supporter, they had a design that awed all that saw it. Having raised $2 million of in-kind services and another $1 million committed in donations, the group was ready to move ahead at a very ambitious pace.|$|E
