50|$|Active <b>Power</b> <b>Stabilizer</b> Suspension System (APSSS), {{also known}} as Active <b>Power</b> <b>Stabilizer</b> Suspension System, is an {{electric}} active suspension system with active anti-roll bars developed by Toyota Motor Corporation for its high-end vehicles including Lexus models. By altering stabilizer bar stiffness, this system acts to reduce body tilt during cornering, keeping the vehicle more level during turns and improving handling, {{as opposed to the}} natural tendency of a vehicle to roll due to the lateral forces experienced during high-speed maneuvering. The active stabilizer system relies on vehicle body sensors and electric motors. The first production usage of this system was introduced in August 2005 with the Lexus GS430 sport sedan, followed by the 2008 Lexus LS 600h luxury sedan. The development of APSSS is claimed to be the world's first electric active stabilizer system. It is a system improvement of an earlier Toyota technology called Toyota TEMS (Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension).|$|E

This need motivated the design of a <b>power</b> <b>stabilizer</b> (UPSz). Method of Pulse with modulation (PWM) was adopted. This method is capable of modulating a varying input to a stabilized output. Two input sources were considered; a fluctuating 220 V volt mains supply and a constant 12 V battery. The 12 V battery was rectified to provide an AC power supply to the load {{in the absence of the}} utility mains. The control circuit ensured a stabilized output voltage from input range of 140 V to 260 V AC power supply which is about ± 40 V to the usual supply voltage from the utility mains of 180 V- 220 V in Nigeria. Appropriate protection circuits were incorporated against surges to which ensured the safety of home/office appliances. A variac was used to obtain various AC voltage levels during the testing. The voltage and current results at different loadings (in watts) of the UPSz were obtained. These results were compared with those of commercially readily available offline UPS of the same rating. The UPSz unlike the commercially available types delivered a stabilized voltage of 220 V to different loads of 60 W to 400 W range at a fluctuating input voltage range of 140 V to 260 V.

40|$|Abstract — Most of Power {{systems are}} {{steadily}} increasing with ever higher capacity. All individual systems are interconnected to each other. The Modern power systems have {{transformed into the}} system of very large size. With growing generation capacity, different areas in power system are added with very large inertia. As a consequence in large interconnected power systems, low frequency oscillations have large importance. Low frequency oscillations include local area modes and inter-area modes. Inter-area modes of oscillations {{may be caused by}} the either high gain exciters or heavy power transfer across weak tie line. The occurrence of the inter-area oscillations depends on various reasons such as weak ties between interconnected areas, voltage level, transmitted power and load. At time, the oscillations may continue to grow causing the instability of the power system. lots of power system stabilizers have been developed by the researchers in the past few years, but the area is still open for the efficient <b>power</b> <b>stabilizer</b> development which can efficiently able to handle the power oscillations without increasing the system controller system complexity.

40|$|In {{this project}} {{the use of}} Artificial Intelligence in Power System Stability Enhancement is studied. The focus of the project is on low {{frequency}} oscillation in power systems. These oscillations known as electromechanical modes of oscillation were observed in power systems in the early 1960 ’s. They {{are the result of}} kinetic energy exchange between synchronous generators in a power system. Power System Stabilizers has been used to dampen these oscillations. Conventional Power System Stabilizers (CPSS) have been used for decades in power systems. They consist of a washout filter and two lead lag blocks to compensate the phase lag of the system. Tuning of CPSS is of paramount importance for proper response and function. In this project, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization process is introduced in order to tune the parameters of a CPSS in a Single Machine Infinite Bus system. The power system is modelled in PowerFactory and GA optimization uses the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox. An effective data exchange is engineered between PowerFactory and MATLAB to facilitate the tuning process. The optimization is performed using the position of the eigenvalues of the power system which are found by running Modal Analysis in PowerFactory. The main goal of optimization is to tune the parameters of CPSS to maximize the dampening ratio of all oscillatory modes. In the next section of the project an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based <b>power</b> <b>stabilizer</b> is introduced. Two neural networks are designed.

40|$|Available {{commercial}} {{applications of}} <b>power</b> system <b>stabilizers</b> assure optimal damping of synchronous generator’s oscillations {{only in a}} small part of operating range. Parameters of the <b>power</b> system <b>stabilizer</b> are usually tuned for the selected operating point. Extensive variations of the synchronous generator’s operation result in changed dynamic characteristics. This is the reason that the <b>power</b> system <b>stabilizer</b> tuned for the nominal operating point does not satisfy preferred damping in the overall operation area. The small-signal stability and the transient stability of the synchronous generators have represented an attractive problem for testing different concepts of the modern control theory. Of all the methods, the adaptive control has proved to be the most suitable for the design of the <b>power</b> system <b>stabilizers.</b> The adaptive control has been used in order to assure the optimal damping through the entire synchronous generator’s operating range. The use of the adaptive control is possible because the loading variations and consequently the variations of the synchronous generator’s dynamic characteristics are, in most cases, essentially slower than the adaptation mechanism. The paper shows the development and the application of the self-tuning <b>power</b> system <b>stabilizer</b> based on recursive least square identification method and linear quadratic regulator. Identification method is used to calculate the parameters of the Heffron-Phillips model of the synchronous generator.

The oscillations, which are typically in the frequency range of 0. 2 to 3. 0 Hz, might be excited by the disturbances in the system or, in some cases, might even build up spontaneously. These scillations limit the power transmission capability of a network and, sometimes, even cause a loss of synchronism and an eventual breakdown of the entire system.
