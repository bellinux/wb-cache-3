25|$|Microlithography and {{nanolithography}} refer {{specifically to}} lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 micrometers are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 nanometers are considered nanolithographic. Photolithography {{is one of}} these methods, often applied to semiconductor manufacturing of microchips. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated <b>photomask</b> <b>or</b> reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.|$|R
5000|$|Stepping level {{refers to}} the {{introduction}} or revision of the lithographic <b>photomask</b> <b>or</b> masks within the set of plates that generate the pattern that produces an integrated circuit.

5000|$|Using photolithography, a light {{exposure}} pattern is created on the substrate using a <b>photomask</b> <b>or</b> virtual <b>photomask</b> projected from a digital micromirror device.

Following de-protection, nucleotides with a photolabile protecting group {{are exposed to}} the entire surface and the chemical coupling process only occurs where light was exposed in the previous step. This process can be repeated to synthesize oligonucleotides of relatively short lengths on the surface, nucleotide by nucleotide.|$|R

40|$|In this letter, {{we propose}} an AlGaN/GaN {{normally}} off high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) with reverse drain blocking capability. The device features a Schottky-ohmic drain electrode {{in which a}} Schottky-controlled normally off channel is inserted between the gate and the conventional ohmic drain contact. Under negative reverse drain bias, the normally off channel provides an energy barrier that effectively blocks the reverse current conduction while contributing only 0. 55 V onset voltage in the forward-biased ON state. In a device with a gate-drain distance of 9 mu m, a reverse blocking voltage of - 321 V was obtained at V-GS = 0 V, comparable with the forward blocking voltage of 351 V; at V-GS = 3 V, the reverse blocking voltage was - 276 V. The new HEMT also exhibits no degradation in drain saturation current and does not need extra <b>photomask</b> <b>or</b> process steps to fabricate.

40|$|Vapor-deposition {{processes}} {{and the resulting}} thin polymer films provide consistent coatings that decouple the underlying substrate surface properties and can be applied for surface modification regardless of the substrate material and geometry. Here, various ways to structure these vapor-deposited polymer thin films are described. Well-established and available photolithography and soft lithography techniques are widely performed {{for the creation of}} surface patterns and microstructures on coated substrates. However, because of the requirements for applying a <b>photomask</b> <b>or</b> an elastomeric stamp, these techniques are mostly limited to flat substrates. Attempts are also conducted to produce patterned structures on non-flat surfaces with various maskless methods such as light-directed patterning and direct-writing approaches. The limitations for patterning on non-flat surfaces are resolution and cost. With the requirement of chemical control and/or precise accessibility to the linkage with functional molecules, chemically and topographically defined interfaces have recently attracted considerable attention.
