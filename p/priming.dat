The development of immunity to polio efficiently blocks person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community.|$|E
5|$|Aestheticism was {{sufficiently}} in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience (1881). Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde {{to make a}} lecture tour of North America, simultaneously <b>priming</b> the pump for the US tour of Patience and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public. Wilde journeyed on the SS Arizona, arriving 2 January 1882, and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four months, it continued {{for almost a year}} due to the commercial success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies, and now one of his lectures was on interior design.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the events}} of the first game and Halo 2, the Chief and a few other {{survivors}} return to Earth, warning of an impending Covenant attack; this attack forms the first mission of the game. Meanwhile, the Covenant, unaware of the destructive nature of the rings, attempt to fire another ring, Installation 05, to fulfill their religious prophecy and to do so launch an attack on Earth. Helping the Chief to defend the Earth are Sergeant Avery Johnson and Commander Miranda Keyes. One race in the Covenant, the Elites, learn the truth about the rings and are led by a former Elite commander named the Arbiter (also a player character) to join forces with humanity to stop the firing of the ring. Though they are successful, the unexpected shutdown of the installation triggers a fail-safe protocol, <b>priming</b> all the rings for firing from the Ark.|$|E

5|$|During {{the events}} of Halo 2, the Covenant and humans {{discover}} a second ringworld, Installation 05, or Delta Halo. It was monitored by 2401 Penitent Tangent, who completely ignored Flood warnings and was captured by their leader, the Gravemind. The Covenant leadership wants to activate the installation, believing it {{is the key to}} their salvation. At the same time, the Flood, led by an intelligence known as the Gravemind, lay siege to the Covenant's city-ship, High Charity. After 343 Guilty Spark informs Halo's true purpose to the Arbiter, a Covenant holy warrior, of the danger that the Halos truly represent, a group of humans and Covenant Elites prevent the firing of the ring. The unexpected shutdown activates a fail-safe protocol, <b>priming</b> the remaining Halo installations for remote activation from a location known as The Ark.|$|E
5|$|Marigene Butler, head {{conservator}} at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, oversaw a multi-national {{research project}} between 1983 and 1989. Her team investigated the provenance {{of the two}} paintings and relationships between them through technical analyses. At that time both paintings underwent further restorations. They examined the wooden supports, parchment fibres and <b>priming</b> layers of the Philadelphia painting. A sample of paint {{was taken from the}} seraph-Christ's wings; analysis found particles of pure ultramarine, the most expensive pigment at the time. The team identified red organic lake in the stigmata wounds, and vermilion and lead white on Francis's cheeks. Infrared reflectography found a base layer of paint overlaid with hatching and fine brush strokes on an additional layer. The greenery was painted with a copper resinate that over time has darkened to brown. The mountains and sky were painted with ultramarine and lead white. Compared to the Turin painting, the Philadelphia version shows little evidence of underdrawing.|$|E

25|$|The terms {{positive}} and negative <b>priming</b> refer to when <b>priming</b> affects the speed of processing. A positive prime speeds up processing, while a negative prime lowers the speed to slower than un-primed levels. Positive <b>priming</b> is caused by simply experiencing the stimulus, while negative <b>priming</b> is caused by experiencing the stimulus, and then ignoring it. Positive <b>priming</b> effects happen even if the prime is not consciously seen. The effects of {{positive and}} negative <b>priming</b> are visible in event-related potential (ERP) readings.|$|E
25|$|The {{view that}} perceptual <b>priming</b> is {{controlled}} by the extrastriate cortex while conceptual <b>priming</b> {{is controlled by}} the left prefrontal cortex is undoubtedly an oversimplified view of the process, and current work is focused on elucidating the brain regions involved in <b>priming</b> in more detail.|$|E

25|$|Negative <b>priming</b> is {{identified}} {{as one of the}} cognitive process necessary for goal directed behaviors. It is associated with many cognitive processes such as inhibition, selective attention, encoding, memory retrieval, and short-term memory. Neuropsychiatric disorders may be due to problems with some of the above-mentioned areas of cognition. Currently, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and Tourette syndrome are being studied with reference to negative <b>priming.</b> Understanding the paradigm of negative <b>priming</b> can lead to the use of negative <b>priming</b> tasks as diagnosing tools to identify the disorders. Knowledge about the physiological basis of negative <b>priming</b> can also help in designing therapies or treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders.|$|E
25|$|Repetition <b>priming,</b> {{also called}} direct <b>priming,</b> {{is a form}} of {{positive}} <b>priming.</b> When a stimulus is experienced, it is also primed.

25|$|In the {{psychology}} of visual perception and motor control, the term response <b>priming</b> denotes a special form of visuomotor <b>priming</b> effect. The distinctive feature of response <b>priming</b> is that prime and target are presented in quick succession (typically, less than 100 milliseconds apart) and are coupled to identical or alternative motor responses. When a speeded motor response is performed to classify the target stimulus, a prime immediately preceding the target can thus induce response conflicts when assigned to a different response as the target. These response conflicts have observable effects on motor behavior, leading to <b>priming</b> effects, e.g., in response times and error rates. A special property of response <b>priming</b> is its independence from visual awareness of the prime: For example, response <b>priming</b> effects can increase under conditions where visual awareness of the prime is decreasing.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{problems}} associated with this inhibition model. This model accounts for negative <b>priming</b> only when the stimuli are repetitively ignored as distractors during a goal directed behavior of selecting the target stimulus. This model does not support negative <b>priming</b> effects found in cases short of goal directed behavior. Another issue is that negative <b>priming</b> effects {{have been found to}} be long-term contradicting to the proposed transient residual inhibition. Long-term persistence of negative <b>priming</b> questions the validity of the distractor inhibition model.|$|E
25|$|Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), {{the most}} common form of dementia, have been studied {{extensively}} as far as <b>priming</b> goes. Results are conflicting in some cases, but overall, AD patients show decreased <b>priming</b> effects on word-stem completion and free association tasks, while retaining normal performance on lexical decision tasks. These results suggest that AD patients are impaired in any sort of <b>priming</b> task that requires semantic processing of the stimuli, while <b>priming</b> tasks that require visuoperceptual interpretation of stimuli are unaffected by Alzheimers.|$|E

25|$|Kindness <b>priming</b> is a {{specific}} form of <b>priming</b> that occurs when a subject experiences an act of kindness and subsequently experiences a lower threshold of activation when subsequently encountering positive stimuli.
