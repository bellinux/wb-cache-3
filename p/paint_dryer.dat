30|$|Bipyridine {{displays}} excellent {{catalytic activity}} in autoxidation if added to manganese 2 -ethylhexanoate, {{but it has}} a retarding effect on the catalytic activity of cobalt dryers (Warzeska et al. 2002). Polyamines, such as 1, 1, 4, 7, 10, 10 -hexamethyl triethylenetetramine (HMTETA) in a complex with manganese, accelerate the oxidation of ethyl linoleate (Oyman et al. 2004). Likewise, another polyamine 1, 4, 7 -trimethyl- 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane (MeTACN) forms a complex with manganese(IV) (MnMeTACN) that catalyses the oxidation of ethyl linoleate (Oyman et al. 2004). Working with ethyl linoleate as a surrogate for linseed oil, van Gorkum has reported [Mn(III)(tbpppy)(dpm)] (where H 2 tbpppy is 2 -[bis(2 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -di-tert-butylbenzyl)aminomethyl]pyridine and Hdpm is dipivaloylmethane) to be the best potential alkyd <b>paint</b> <b>dryer,</b> acting through a reduction of Mn(III) to Mn(II) (van Gorkum et al. 2007). Cobalt and copper salts have been reported to enhance the catalytic activity of the manganese salt in the decomposition of hydroperoxides (Minisci et al. 2003).|$|E
5|$|Selected {{heavy metals}} {{are used as}} {{catalysts}} in fuel processing (rhenium, for example), synthetic rubber and fibre production (bismuth), emission control devices (palladium), and in self-cleaning ovens (where cerium(IV) oxide in the walls of such ovens helps oxidise carbon-based cooking residues). In soap chemistry, heavy metals form insoluble soaps {{that are used in}} lubricating greases, <b>paint</b> <b>dryers,</b> and fungicides (apart from lithium, the alkali metals and the ammonium ion form soluble soaps).|$|R
40|$|Against the {{background}} of increasing demands on the reproducibility of the drying process of paint coatings and on increased process reliability, the simulation of temperature distribution, thermal conduction and flow conditions in industrial <b>paint</b> <b>dryers</b> is becoming increasingly significant. At the end of 2006 a research project was therefore started coordinated by the Institute of Industrial Manufacturing and Management (IFF) at the University Stuttgart in cooperation with four car manufacturers, four plant and paint manufacturers, two software houses and three universities. The {{focus is on the}} development of an experimentally verfified simulation application to predict the convective unsteady drying of paint films on complex, three-dimensional components. This article illustrates the current state of technology, existing requirements and the results achieved so far...|$|R
40|$|This Scheme is {{made for}} Indonesia which is {{difficult}} to dry the paint car by sunshine. As we know that Indonesia has the weather with the high rain fall. It will not effective because it need some days to dry to get the satisfying result. Therefore many people do various efforts to close insufficiency of <b>dryer</b> the <b>paint</b> car by sunshine that is by exploiting technology of drining. Draining at general means dissociation {{a small number of}} hydrogen differ from materials, so it will decrease the content of the rest hydrogen in the materials until the lowest acceptable value. (Warren L. Mc Cabe; 199 : 249) As what states above, hence people are created a <b>dryer</b> <b>paint</b> car which has the systematic function. This <b>dryer</b> <b>paint</b> car is designed using electric power and it expected to get the quicker draining paint result and as good as possible. The result of draining using the dryer made in have a lot of advantage such as; it is not depend on the weather, it is not need a wide place, the time of draining process can be detected. So, this design can be used to help the draining time arrangement...|$|R

Taught by her mother to avoid wasting anything, she never {{purchased}} a <b>dryer,</b> <b>painted</b> her own home, mowed her own lawn, refused to go to restaurants or movies, grew her own fruits and vegetables in her meager backyard, and refused to pay for cable TV {{until the age of}} 95.|$|R
40|$|Like nature's honeycomb, foam is a {{structure}} of many-sided cells, apparently solid but actually only three percent material and 97 percent air. Foam is made by a heat-producing chemical reaction which expands a plastic material in a manner somewhat akin to the heat-induced rising of a loaf of bread. The resulting structure of interconnected cells is flexible yet strong and extremely versatile in applicati 6 n. Foam can, for example, be a sound absorber in one form, while in another it allows sound to pass through it. It {{can be a very}} soft powder puff material {{and at the same time}} a highly abrasive scrubber. A sampling of foam uses includes stereo speaker grilles, applying postage meter ink, filtering lawnmower carburetor air; deadening noise in trucks and tractors, applying cosmetics, releasing fabric softener and antistatic agents in home clothes <b>dryers,</b> <b>painting,</b> filtering factory heating and ventilating systems, shining shoes, polishing cars, sponge-mopping floors, acting as pre-operative surgical scrubbers-the list is virtually limitless. The process by which foam is made produces "windows," thin plastic membranes connecting the cell walls. Windowed foam is used in many applications but for certain others-filtering, for example-it is desirable to have a completely open network. Scott Paper Company's Foam Division, Chester, Pennsylvania, improved a patented method of "removing the windows," to create an open structure that affords special utility in filtering applications. NASA technology contributed to Scott's improvement...|$|R
