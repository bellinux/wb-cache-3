40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} duration that adds depth and realism {{to the subject of}} duration gap, which is usually presented as a “stand alone ” issue in much of the banking literature. Duration is an important tool used by managers, but many overly simplified examples are not consistent with operating realities. This study offers a more realistic approach to measuring <b>portfolio</b> <b>duration</b> and duration gap which will enhance the bank’s strategic planning process...|$|E
40|$|A bond {{portfolio}} selection model is {{developed in a}} dynamic framework using different term structures, but without transactions costs. We show that the optimal portfolios are consistent with Khang 2 ̆ 7 s dynamic immunization theorem, i. e., the optimal path consists of making <b>portfolio</b> <b>duration</b> equal to the investor 2 ̆ 7 s horizon planning period. The model is then extended to include transaction costs. The resulting optimal portfolios are no longer consistent with Khang 2 ̆ 7 s dynamic immunization theorem. In fact, the strategy for constructing the optimal portfolio consists of initially choosing a portfolio with a duration that is smaller than the horizon planning period...|$|E
30|$|The {{reported}} {{results for}} level and immunization strategies are obtained by minimizing the M-Squared {{subject to the}} condition that the <b>portfolio’s</b> <b>duration</b> {{is equal to the}} target duration.

40|$|Duration is {{a measure}} of the {{effective}} maturity of a bond or bond <b>portfolio.</b> A higher <b>duration</b> is indicative of higher price risk, particularly in response to changing rates. Thus, if interest rates rise and bond prices fall, a bond with a higher duration will experience a sharper drop in price. Given the relatively low level of interest rates in the current market, bond investors have moved to lower <b>duration</b> <b>portfolios,</b> as protection against expected increases in rates.

50|$|The {{sensitivity}} of {{a portfolio of}} bonds such as a bond mutual fund to changes in interest rates can also be important. The average duration of the bonds in the portfolio is often reported. The <b>duration</b> of a <b>portfolio</b> equals the weighted average maturity {{of all of the}} cash flows in the portfolio. If each bond has the same yield to maturity, this equals the weighted average of the <b>portfolio's</b> bond's <b>durations,</b> with weights proportional to the bond prices. Otherwise the weighted average of the bond's durations is just a good approximation, but it can still be used to infer how the value of the portfolio would change in response to changes in interest rates.|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of maxmim bond portfolios is proved in very general contexts, {{and so for}} instance, this existence holds if an immunized portfolio does not exist but atl the considered <b>portfolios</b> have <b>duration</b> equal to the investor planning periodo To characterize the maxmin portfolio, saddle point conditions are found, and from them, an algorithm is given. This algorithm permits to find the maxmin portfolio in practical situations. Relations between maxmin portfolios and the ones minimizing the dispersion measures (for instance, the M-squared or the Ñ measure) are also studied. In particular, it will be proved that minimizing the dispersion measure and looking for maxmin portfolio are equivalent strategies only when {{we are working with}} pure discount bonds. Finally, as a consecuence of the obtained results, two new strategies to invest are proposed...|$|R
40|$|With the new {{regulations}} of Basel III and Solvency II there is a necessity to have tools that can measure different types of financial and insurance risk in a <b>portfolio.</b> Stochastic <b>Duration</b> is such a measure. This new type of measure, which is {{for the first time}} implemented in this thesis, can be used to analyze the sensitivity of complex portfolios of interest rate derivatives with respect to the stochastic fluctuation of the entire term structure of interest rates or the yield surface without assuming as in the classical case (Macaulay duration) flat or piecewise flat interest rates. It is conceivable that this concept will serve as an important tool within risk management and replace the classical Macaulay duration. Moreover, using the concept of immunization strategies based on stochastic duration {{we will be able to}} hedge the expected uncertainty due to the changes in the forward rate in complex bond portfolios...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{dissertation}} {{is to demonstrate}} the effects of institutional) investors 2 ̆ 7 preferences on their trading and holding activities. To be specific, I look at the choices of bonds in certain maturity ranges of insurance companies, their tendency not to frequently trade. I also look at institutional investors 2 ̆ 7 responses to rating changes. ^ In the first manuscript, I present direct and comprehensive evidence on preferred habitat by investigating the Treasury bond duration choices of property liability insurance companies. I model insurers 2 ̆ 7 <b>portfolio</b> <b>durations</b> as a partial adjustment process toward unobservable target durations. The findings confirm the presence of preferred habitat. First, I find evidence consistent with the duration matching hypothesis that durations of insurers 2 ̆ 7 Treasury bond portfolios and expected claim payments are positively correlated. Second, durations of insurers 2 ̆ 7 Treasury bond portfolios are positively correlated with insurers 2 ̆ 7 risk management ability. Finally, firms may deviate from targets if yield premiums offered at non-preferred maturities are sufficiently high. ^ The second manuscript extends the first study from the Treasury bond market to the corporate bond market. Insurance companies collectively own one third of outstanding corporate bonds (Campbell and Taksler, 2003). They are conventionally viewed as buy-and-hold passive investors. I confirm this by demonstrating a strong negative relationship between insurance ownership and liquidity. Also, there is a robust positive relation between insurance ownership and bond yield spreads after controlling for bond liquidity. This suggests either the presence of unpriced risk factors correlated with insurance ownership or insurers have a superior ability in picking bonds. ^ The third manuscript investigates how institutional investors trade on the analyst recommendations change and examine stock performance following their trading activities. I find institutional investors 2 ̆ 7 trades react to rating downgrades more quickly and in a greater magnitude than to upgrades. Regardless of upgrades or downgrades, most heavily purchased stocks beat those least purchased while least sold stocks beat those most heavily sold in the portfolio formation quarter. Further, upon stock upgrades, stocks least sold or heavily purchased by institutional investors with superior past performance persistently outperform those heavily sold or least purchased by those investors. ...|$|R
40|$|Hazard rate {{models are}} widely used to model {{duration}} data {{in a wide range}} of disciplines, from bio-statistics to economics. The aim of this insert is to supplement the <b>portfolio</b> of <b>duration</b> data analysis tools which Stata provides. pgmhaz estimates, by maximum likelihood, two discrete time (grouped duration data) proportional hazards regression models, one of which incorporates a gamma mixture distribution to summarize unobserved individual heterogeneity (or ‘frailty’). Covariates may include regressor variables summarizing observed differences between persons (either fixed or time-varying), and variables summarizing the duration dependence of the hazard rate. With suitable definition of covariates, models with a fully non-parametric specification for duration dependence may be estimated; so too may parametric specifications. pgmhaz thus provides a useful complement to cox and st stcox, weibull and st stweib. The two models estimated are: (1) the Prentice-Gloeckler (1978) model; and (2) the Prentice-Gloeckler (1978) model incorporating a gamma mixture distribution to summarize unobserved individual heterogeneity, as proposed by Meyer (1990). These are referred to as Model 1 and Model 2 respectively below. The versions of the Prentice-Gloeckler-Meyer hazard models estimated are as described by Stewart (1996), and my exposition of the models draws heavily on his paper...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{solvency}} analysis through internal models {{in the case of}} a portfolio of life annuities, focusing on the interplay between stochastic interest rate dynamics and the survival evolution in time. This specific aspect is investigated basing the survival death rates on Poisson Lee Carter model approached according to the Iterative Procedure and two simulated approaches on the Poisson Lee Carter: the Standard Procedure and the Stratified Sampling Procedure. The financial aspect, particularly notable in <b>portfolios</b> with long <b>duration</b> and multiplicity of payments as in the considered case, is tackled assuming different stochastic hypotheses on the interest rates evolution. Aim of the paper is to deepen the reaction of solvency measures as the surplus index and the ruin probability to the specific financial and demographic scenario.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the capital requirements represents the first Pillar of Solvency II. In this framework the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) {{is defined as the}} amount of capital that an insurer needs in order to remain viable in the market and maintain its default probability below a certain level. The main purpose of the new solvency regulation is to obtain more realistic modelling and assessment of the different risks insurance companies are exposed to. According to this regulation the SCR standard calculation is based on a modular approach where the overall risk is split into several modules and submodules for which SCRs are computed separately and then aggregated according to pre-specified correlation matrices. Longevity risk {{is one of the major}} risks that an insurance company or a pension fund will have to deal with and it is expected that its importance will grow in the near future. In agreement with these considerations in Solvency II standard formula longevity risk is explicitly considered as a sub-module of the life underwriting risk module. In this paper we will refer exactly to the sub-module of longevity risk and, in a risk management perspective, we suggest a multiperiod approach for calculating the corresponding SCR, that is, we estimate at issue time the solvency adequacy along the overall <b>portfolio</b> contract <b>duration.</b> We propose a backtesting framework for measuring the consistency of the SCR calculations for life insurance policies. In particular to evaluate the performances of the SCR calculation methodologies we quantify the convergence of the SCR forecasts through the time.

50|$|The most {{prolific}} author on dedicated portfolio theory, Martin L. Leibowitz, {{was the first}} to refer to dedicated portfolios as “cash matching” portfolios. He demonstrated how they are the simplest case of the technique known as bond portfolio immunization. In his sketch of its history, he traces the origin of immunization to Frederick R. Macaulay who first suggested the notion of “duration” for fixed income securities in 1938. Duration represents the average life of the coupon payments and redemption of a bond and links changes in interest rates to the volatility of a bond’s value. One year later, J.R. Hicks independently developed a similar formulation referred to as the “average period.” In 1942, T.C. Koopmans pointed out in a report that, by matching the duration of the bonds held in a <b>portfolio</b> to the <b>duration</b> of liabilities those bonds would fund, the effects of interest rate changes could be mitigated or nullified completely, i.e. immunized. In 1945, Paul Samuelson formulated essentially the same concept, calling it the “weighted-average time period.” None of these earliest researchers cited each other’s work, suggesting each developed the concept independently. The work culminated in a 1952 paper by a British actuary, F. M. Redington.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we look at}} {{the problem}} of {{modelling}} the temporal dependence of defaults and introduce a novel approach for describing the chain reaction of infectious defaults. We extend a Markov chain model for crisis management in epidemiology, namely, Greenwood’s model, to describe the chain reaction of infectious defaults of bonds across any pair of industrial sectors. The development of the extended version of Greenwood’s model contributes to the literature in two major aspects. First, it contributes to the credit risk literature by providing a new framework for measuring risk of a credit <b>portfolio</b> over the <b>duration</b> of a default crisis, called a default cycle. This is different from the traditional approach for risk measurement in which the time horizon is fixed, say one day or one week, and leads to a new dimension for risk management. Second, it provides a new model for crisis management in epidemiology by extending an important model in the field. We employ recursive formulae for the joint probability distributions of the duration of a default crisis and the number of defaults over the crisis. Moreover, we employ two important risk measures, namely, Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES), as proxies of risk over a default cycle. Numerical experiments are given to illustrate the practical implementation o...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMany {{central banks}} adopt an active {{investment}} style for reserve management. This paper discusses various possible enhancements to active management tools and processes to generate extra returns {{in an increasingly}} challenging environment. The proposed framework {{is based on an}} affine model, which includes macroeconomic and market sentiment indicators among the explanatory variables. Using estimates of expected excess returns drawn from the model, an operational indicator produces input highlighting the <b>portfolio's</b> exposure to <b>duration</b> risk. This indicator is incorporated within a broader framework, in which a scorecard considers a range of qualitative elements, including consensus figures on macroeconomic data, monetary policy and interest rates. These elements are then combined with the model output to produce a comprehensive indication with respect to portfolio deviation from the benchmark. It {{should be noted that the}} approach presented in this paper is experimental; it has not yet been used in an active portfolio. Finally, consideration is given to the governance of the central bank investment process in order to assess how the proposed enhancements could strengthen the decision-making process. The analysis suggests that the scorecard with model-based input may address some weaknesses inherent in tactical decision- making.

40|$|Ensuring {{access to}} a truly ‘European’ energy grid for every {{consumer}} and supplier in the European Union is a core objective of the single market project. From {{the first wave of}} liberalization directives up until the ‘draft’ framework guidelines of September 2010 on capacity allocation and congestion management being prepared by ERGEG on behalf of the new Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER), the objective of the access regime in both sector is similar: to creating capacity to compete. The objective {{of this paper is to}} review and compare from a legal point of view the evolution of the EU access regime in the electricity and gas sectors. We find strong similarities for two otherwise very different sectors, as well as an influence of the electricity regime on the gas regime. The sector-specific regulatory regime, supported by the use of competition law, organises a market design in both sectors based as much as possible on short-term capacity allocation with a liquid secondary trading platforms. The imposition of UIOLI mechanisms and an increased focus on firmness of capacity is certainly the way forward but implementation still is an issue. The right <b>portfolio</b> of capacity <b>durations</b> that are to be proposed by TSOs also remains an open question. The specific features of these two commodities result however in slightly different results in practice. In electricity, the development of market coupling initiatives creates new regulatory challenges but price convergence is now in sight. In gas, the progress has been slower and efficiently functioning spot markets are yet to emerge. access regime; electricity; gas; European Union; competition law; framework guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are {{characterized}} as complex distributed systems exhibiting substantial uncertainty due to {{interactions with the}} physical world. Today’s electric grids are often described as CPS because a portfolio of distributed supplies must be dispatched in real-time to match uncontrolled, uncertain demand while adhering to constraints imposed by the intervening transmission and distribution network. With the increased control complexity required by deep penetration of fluctuating renewable supplies, the grid becomes more profoundly a CPS {{and needs to be}} addressed as a system. In this evolving CPS, a large fraction of supply is under-actuated, a substantial portion of demand needs to become dispatchable, interactions among distributed elements are no longer unidirectional, and operating requirements of elements are more dynamic. To more sharply define these CPS challenges, we obtain a yearlong, detailed measurement of the real-time blend of supplies on the primary California grid dispatched to meet current demand and then scale the solar and wind assets, preserving uncontrolled weather effects, to a level of penetration associated with California’s 2050 GHG targets. In this representation of a future sustainable grid, we assess the impact of demand shaping, storage, and agility on the reconstituted supply <b>portfolio,</b> characterize resulting <b>duration</b> curves and ramping, and investigate the distributed control and management regime. We articulate new operational and market opportunities and challenges that may materialize from intermittent periods of abundance and scarcity in the overall energy network. We find that in a sustainable grid, lulls in renewable production during winter are more critical than peaks in demand during summer, capacity for load shifting and energy storage are more valuable as renewables penetration increases, and that grid balancing requires integrated management of supply and demand resources.

40|$|Master of EducationThis thesis explores, {{analyses}} and evaluates {{the use of}} portfolios in improving learning through enhanced reflection and, in particular, improving students' responsibility for, and control of their learning through explicit discussion and reflection. The researcher has critically reviewed the research literature relevant to the area. Many conference papers, journal articles and books relating to portfolio assessment have been critically viewed and various issues noted. Whilst experiencing the process of reading, examining, reviewing and reflecting, the researcher's goal was to cultivate {{some of the issues}} and questions underpinning this research study. The research study involved a group of six middle primary students who had varying capabilities and knowledge of portfolios. A comprehensive case study was chosen primarily because of the indepth descriptive and qualitative methodological nature of the information needed from students, parents and the teacher. There was a need to understand and explain the meaning of social phenomena with as little disruption to the natural setting as possible. This study examines what portfolios are and how they can be used to link children and teachers with different ways of knowing and thinking. For students, the emphasis was on the potential learning power of them becoming more reflective; and for teachers the emphasis was on informing them of the effectiveness of the arrangements they are making to support student learning. The study employed observation, discussion and interviews to investigate student and teacher reflective practices as the students used <b>portfolios</b> over a <b>duration</b> of six months. In addition to this, parent observation and comments regarding the impact of portfolios on their children's ability to reflectively discuss their learning were obtained {{through the use of a}} structured questionnaire. Final analysis of the data provided understandings of the nature of the portfolio process by revealing a number of significant findings upon which effective teaching and learning was dependent. It demonstrated how measures to increase student self-reflection and assessment takes time and effort by all stakeholders. Of specific interest was the nature of the relationship between the stakeholders as revealed through discussion of the findings. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some {{conventional and}} new measures of market, credit, and liquidity risks for government bonds. These measures are analyzed {{from the perspective}} of a sovereign''s debt manager. In particular, it examines duration, convexity, M-square, skewness, kurtosis, and VaR statistics as measures of interest rate exposure; a VaR statistic as the prominent measure of exchange rate exposure; the balance sheet approach (or contingent claims approach), and its consequent probability of default as the most promising measure of credit risk exposure; and an elasticity approach and a VaR statistic to measure liquidity risk. Along with the formulas for the various statistics proposed, we provide simple examples of their application to some common risk valuation cases. Finally, we present an integrated approach for the simultaneous estimation of a portfolio''s interest rate and exchange rate risk using the VaR methodology. The integrated approach is then extended to also include N risk factors. This approach allows us to measure the total risk of a portfolio, provided that the volatilities and correlations among the risk factors can be estimated.
