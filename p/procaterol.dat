40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundAlthough <b>procaterol</b> is used {{clinically}} as a β 2 -adrenergic {{receptor agonist}} to relax airway smooth muscle, {{it has not}} yet been clarified whether <b>procaterol</b> has inotropic effects on respiratory muscles. MethodsThree intervention groups were investigated: a <b>procaterol</b> inhalation only group; a <b>procaterol</b> inhalation plus endotoxin injection group (in vivo); and a <b>procaterol</b> incubation group (in vitro). The diaphragm muscle in all groups was dissected and measurements of its contractile properties were performed. ResultsThe effects of <b>procaterol</b> inhalation shifted the force-frequency curves upward at 30 minutes after inhalation, and inhibited the decline of force-frequency curves due to endotoxin injection in vivo. In vitro administration of <b>procaterol</b> resulted in an increase in the force-frequency curves in a dose-dependent manner.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} inhaled beta 2 adrenergic agonists on the sensitivity of airway cough receptors, the effect of inhaled <b>procaterol</b> on cough induced by aerosolised capsaicin, a stimulant of C fibres, was studied in patients with asthma or chronic bronchitis and in normal subjects. METHOD [...] Eleven patients with asthma and 10 with chronic bronchitis and 14 normal subjects participated. Increasing concentrations of capsaicin solution were inhaled for 15 seconds by tidal breathing through the mouth at one minute intervals until five or more coughs were elicited, before and 30 minutes after inhalation of 20 micrograms <b>procaterol</b> or placebo (freon gas alone) through a metered dose inhaler. Cough threshold {{was defined as the}} lowest concentration of capsaicin that elicited five or more coughs. To {{evaluate the}} bronchodilator effect of <b>procaterol</b> and the bronchoconstrictor effect of inhaled capsaicin, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) was measured before and one minute after a capsaicin provocation test. This test was carried out both before and 30 minutes after treatment with <b>procaterol</b> or placebo. RESULTS [...] The geometric mean value of cough threshold to capsaicin was significantly increased by <b>procaterol</b> and placebo in both groups of patients but not in the control subjects. The increment in the cough threshold was not significantly different between the treatments with <b>procaterol</b> and placebo in each group. FEV 1 was significantly increased by <b>procaterol</b> but not by placebo in all three groups. CONCLUSIONS [...] Inhaled <b>procaterol</b> has no effect on airway cough receptor sensitivity to capsaicin. The attenuation of the cough sensitivity seen after inhalation of <b>procaterol</b> in patients with asthma and bronchitis may result from tachyphylaxis to capsaicin...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{extracellular}} signal-regulated kinase (ERK) - 1 and ERK- 2 {{in controlling}} histamine-induced tone in bovine trachealis was investigated. PD 098059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) - 1, {{had no effect}} on the histamine concentration-response relationship that described contraction. However, in the presence of EGTA, PD 098059 produced a parallel 5 fold rightwards shift of the histamine concentration-response curve without reducing the maximum response. The β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, <b>procaterol,</b> also displaced the histamine-concentration response curve to the right but the effect was much greater than that evoked by PD 098059, non-competitive and seen in the absence and presence of EGTA. A low basal level of pERK- 1 and pERK- 2 was always detected in untreated trachealis, which was significantly higher in EGTA-treated tissues and inhibited by PD 098059 and <b>procaterol.</b> Histamine markedly enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK- 1 and ERK- 2 by a mechanism that was also enhanced by EGTA and significantly attenuated by <b>procaterol</b> and PD 098059. Neither cholera toxin nor Sp- 8 -Br-cAMPS mimicked the ability of <b>procaterol</b> to dephosphorylate ERK. Similarly, neither pertussis toxin (PTX) nor Rp- 8 -Br-cAMPS, an inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), affected basal pERK levels or antagonized the inhibitory effect of <b>procaterol.</b> These data implicate the MKK- 1 /ERK signalling cascade in Ca 2 +-independent, histamine-induced contraction of bovine trachealis. In addition, the ability of <b>procaterol</b> to dephosphorylate ERK in an Rp- 8 -Br-cAMPS- and PTX-insensitive manner suggests that this may contribute to the anti-spasmogenic activity of β 2 -adrenoceptor agonists by activating a novel PKA-independent pathway...|$|E

40|$|Relaxant {{responses}} to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, <b>procaterol,</b> have been examined on preparations of guinea-pig pulmonary artery (beta 2 -adrenoceptors only), rat and rabbit pulmonary artery and rat aorta (beta 2 greater than beta 1), and these responses have been compared with responses of dog left circumflex coronary artery (beta 1 only). Low concentrations of <b>procaterol</b> (3 nM to 100 nM) relaxed KC 1 -contracted preparations of rat aorta and pulmonary artery from rat, rabbit and guinea-pig whereas high concentrations (greater than 1 microM) were required to relax preparations of the dog left circumflex coronary artery.

40|$|Agonists at β 2 adrenoceptors {{are used}} widely as {{bronchodilators}} in treating bronchial asthma. These agents {{also may have}} important anti-inflammatory effects on eosinophils in asthma. We examined whether widely prescribed β 2 -adrenoceptor agonists differ in ability to suppress stimulus-induced eosinophil effector functions such as superoxide anion (O 2 −) generation and degranulation. To examine involvement of cellular adhesion in such responses, we also investigated effects of β 2 agonists on cellular adhesion and on CD 11 b expression by human eosinophils. O 2 − was measured using chemiluminescence. Eosinophil degranulation and adhesion were assessed by a radioimmunoassay for eosinophil protein X (EPX). CD 11 b expression was measured by flow cytometry. Fenoterol inhibited platelet-activating factor (PAF) -induced O 2 − generation by eosinophils significantly more than salbutamol or <b>procaterol.</b> Fenoterol partially inhibited PAF-induced degranulation by eosinophils similarly to salbutamol or <b>procaterol.</b> Fenoterol inhibited phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) -induced O 2 − generation and degranulation by eosinophils, while salbutamol or <b>procaterol</b> did not.

40|$|There {{is a small}} {{increase}} in the functional beta(2) -adrenoceptor response on the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) left atrium {{in the early stages}} of hypertension. In the present study, the functional beta(1) - and beta(2) -adrenoceptors of the left and right atrium in SHR pre-hypertension and age-matched (5 -week-old) Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were characterized. Contractility methods with isoprenaline, T- 0509 (a selective beta(1) -adrenoceptor agonist) and <b>procaterol</b> (a selective beta(2) -adrenoceptor agonist) were used. At 5 weeks, the SHRs were pre-hypertensive. Isoprenaline was more potent on the left atrium of 5 -week-old SHRs than WKY rats. Bisoprolol, a selective beta(1) -adrenoceptor antagonist, was more potent against isoprenaline and T- 0509 on the SHR than WKY rat left atrium. ICI 118, 551, a selective beta(2) -adrenoceptor antagonist, was more potent against <b>procaterol</b> and T- 0509 on the SHR than WKY rat left atrium. The results with bisoprolol and ICI 118, 551 suggest that there are more functional beta(1) - and beta(2) -adrenoceptors on the left atrium of 5 -week-old SHRs than WKY rats. Isoprenaline, T- 0509 and <b>procaterol</b> were equipotent on the right atrium of 5 -week-old WKY rats and SHRs. Bisoprolol was more potent against isoprenaline, T- 0509 and <b>procaterol</b> on the SHR than WKY rat right atrium. ICI 118, 551 was more potent against T- 0509, but not isoprenaline and <b>procaterol,</b> on the SHR than WKY rat left atrium. This suggests there are more functional beta(1) -adrenoceptors, and probably more functional beta(2) -adrenoceptors, on the right atrium of 5 -week-old SHRs than WKY rats.

40|$|Objectives To study {{changes in}} {{parameters}} of right ventricular (RV) diastolic function after <b>procaterol</b> and budesonide inhalation {{in children with}} asthma. Methods This was a one-group pretest-posttest design to determine changes in right ventricular diastolic function following four weeks of inhaled <b>procaterol</b> and budesonide administration. Subjects were children aged 8 to 18 years with frequent episodic asthma recruited consecutively at the Department of Child Health, Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. M-mode and 2 -D echocardiography examinations were performed to determine RV isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), acceleration time (AT), deceleration time (DT), E wave, A wave, E/ A ratio, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE). Means of the RV function parameters before and after treatment were compared using the paired t-test or Wilcoxon test. Results There were 29 patients comprising 16 boys and 13 girls. The means or medians of theE wave, A wave, E/A ratio, acceleration time (AT), deceleration time (DT), and isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) before and after treatment were 0. 55 and 0. 55 em/sec (P= 0. 709), 0. 45 and 0. 35 em/sec (P<O.

40|$|Activation of the β₂-adrenoceptor (β₂-AR) elicits an endothelial {{nitric oxide}} synthase (eNOS) -dependent {{relaxation}} in mouse pulmonary artery, which, contrary to the muscarinic receptor-dependent relaxation, is preserved in hypoxic pulmonary arterial hypertension. We therefore characterized the signaling pathways underlying the β₂-AR-mediated eNOS activation, with special focus on G(i/o) proteins, protein kinases and caveolae. Functional studies (for evaluation of vasorelaxant response), Western blotting (for assessment of eNOS and caveolin- 1 phosphorylation) and transmission electron microscopy (for visualization of caveolae) were conducted in pulmonary arteries from wild-type or caveolin- 1 knockout mice. In wild-type isolated arteries, relaxation to the selective β₂-AR agonist <b>procaterol</b> was reduced by inhibitors of G(i/o) proteins (pertussis toxin, PTX), phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K; wortmannin or LY 294002), Akt (Akt inhibitor X) and Src-kinase (PP 2) and by cholesterol depletion (using methyl-β-cyclodextrin). <b>Procaterol</b> induced eNOS phosphorylation at Ser(1177), which was prevented by PTX, PP 2 or Akt inhibitor. <b>Procaterol</b> also promoted caveolin- 1 phosphorylation at Tyr(14), which was decreased by PTX or PP 2. Caveolin- 1 gene deletion resulted in endothelial caveolae disruption in mouse pulmonary artery and in potentiation of procaterol-induced relaxation. Unlike <b>procaterol,</b> acetylcholine-induced relaxation was unaffected by PTX, methyl-β-cyclodextrin or caveolin- 1 gene deletion. To conclude, the mouse pulmonary endothelial β₂-AR is coupled to a G(i/o) -Src kinase-PI 3 K/Akt pathway to promote eNOS phosphorylation at Ser(1177) leading to a NO-dependent vasorelaxation. Caveolin- 1 exerts a negative control on this response that is abrogated by its phosphorylation at Tyr(14), through a G(i/o) -Src kinase pathway. Since pulmonary β₂-AR- and muscarinic receptor-mediated relaxations differentiate in their respective signaling pathways leading to eNOS activation and sensitivities during hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension, mechanisms underlying eNOS activation might be key determinants of pulmonary endothelial dysfunction...|$|E

Chronic (24 -hr) treatment with 8 -bromo-cAMP also had no effect on m 2 muscarinic receptor mRNA, whereas forskolin caused a 50 % reduction in the steady state levels of m 2 mRNA that could be only partially blocked by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor H- 8 and the protein kinase C inhibitor GF 109203 X. Procaterol-induced down-regulation of M 2 receptors was fully blocked by N-[2 -(methylamino) ethyl]- 5 ′-isoquinoline-sulfonamide and 2 -[1 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) -inol- 3 -yl]- 3 -(indol- 3 -yl) maleimide, implicating both of these kinases in the M 2 muscarinic receptor down-regulation. Conversely, the forskolin- and 8 -bromo-cAMP-induced down-regulation was only partially inhibited and unaffected by these inhibitors, respectively. In control cells and those treated with <b>procaterol</b> for ≤ 2 hr, cAMP generation was significantly inhibited by carbachol. The inhibitory effect of carbachol was, however, lost after 24 -hr exposure to <b>procaterol.</b> This desensitization was partially reversed by preincubations with H- 8 and GF 109203 X.

The problem of air pollution in Yokkaichi was solved in the 1970 s. However, mortality and life expectancy were still affected by the late effects of air pollution in patients with Yokkaichi asthma even in the 2000 s. In this case report, we described the experience of successful treatment of a patient with severe asthmatic status due to Yokkaichi asthma. A 40 s-year-old man, who was officially certified as a patient with Yokkaichi asthma from his infancy, was admitted to hospital due to acute exacerbation of asthma. Mechanical ventilation, intravenous administration of aminophylline and dexamethasone, enteral administration of montelukast, and a transdermal patch of tulobuterol were started. However, because of the lack of improvement in clinical status, inhalation of <b>procaterol</b> using vibrating mesh nebulizer systems was started. Inhalation of <b>procaterol</b> was used three times a day. After using the vibrating mesh nebulizer, respiratory system compliance and hypercapnia rapidly improved. Bilateral expiratory wheezing was diminished. Weaning from mechanical ventilation was initiated, and on the eighth day of mechanical ventilation, the patient was extubated. Although intractable respiratory failure with decreased respiratory system compliance resulting from the late effects of air pollution and a long-time asthmatic inflammatory condition was observed, the use of a vibrating mesh nebulizer for the inhaled administration of <b>procaterol</b> was useful to relieve severe bronchospasm due to Yokkaichi asthma...|$|E
40|$|Background: Nebulized {{drugs for}} asthma {{treatment}} are often mixed together {{in order to}} simplify inhalation regimens, although not recommended. We therefore evaluated aerosol characteristics and physicochemical stability of the admixture of an inhaled corticosteroid suspension with a beta 2 -agonist solution. Methods: An 8 -stage cascade impactor was used to measure the particle size distribution of admixture of Pulmicort® Respules® (budesonide, 0. 5 mg/ 2 mL) with Meptin® Inhalation Solution Unit (<b>procaterol</b> hydrochloride, 30 Mg/ 0. 3 mL) from a jet nebulizer, PARI LC Plus®. Concentration of each drug was assayed with high- pressure liquid chromatography. Physicochemical compatibility was also assessed up to 24 hours after mixing. Results: With regard to budesonide, impactor parameters such as mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and respirable mass (RM) were comparable between admixtures and single-drug preparations (2. 92 ± 0. 03 vs 2. 99 ± 0. 14 µm, 146. 8 ± 2. 9 vs 147. 6 ± 8. 2 µg, respectively). On the other hand, delivery rates of <b>procaterol</b> increased when admixed with budesonide suspension, resulting in significantly higher RM (15. 1 ± 0. 8 vs 10. 2 ± 0. 5 µg, p < 0. 01). Variations from initial concentration in the percentages of drug remaining at any time point were less than 10 %, and there were no appreciable changes in pH of the admixtures for up to 24 hours. Conclusions: There is a possibility that admixture might influence of aerodynamic characteristics of <b>procaterol,</b> but not budesonide. In vivo data will be needed for the clinical implications of our findings...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the clinical effect of supplementary inhaled <b>procaterol</b> hydrochloride in patients with COPD. Methods: Thirty outpatients with moderate to severe COPD (Stage II&ndash;IV) regularly using inhaled tiotropium bromide alone and with dyspnea during daily activities were enrolled. Subjects self-administered 20 &micro;g of inhaled <b>procaterol</b> before daily activities no more than four times daily. Dyspnea symptom scores, St George&# 39;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) activity domains, impulse oscillometry system parameters, and pulmonary function tests were recorded at the beginning and end of the 2 -week study. Results: At baseline, more than 80 % of subjects reported dyspnea when walking up a slope (100. 0 %), climbing stairs (100. 0 %), gardening (93. 3 %), walking on flat ground (90. 0 %), bathing (86. 7 %), getting on a bus or train (83. 3 %), and changing clothes (80. 0 %). After 2 weeks, subjects with Stage III symptoms had significantly improved dyspnea scores on walking up a slope (P = 0. 047), climbing stairs (P = 0. 014), gardening (P = 0. 034), walking on flat ground (P = 0. 006), getting on a bus or train (P = 0. 039), and changing clothes (P = 0. 045). Both symptom and activity SGRQ domains improved significantly in subjects with Stage III symptoms (P = 0. 036 and P = 0. 028, respectively). Resistance of small airways and low-frequency reactance area values improved significantly in subjects with Stage III symptoms (P = 0. 003 and P = 0. 004, respectively). No significant changes were found in pulmonary function tests. Conclusion: Use of supplementary inhaled <b>procaterol</b> before performing daily activities improved dyspnea symptoms in subjects with Stage III COPD.

40|$|Effects of topical {{application}} of adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists on epidermal barrier repair rate after barrier disruption were studied. Agonists and antagonists of β 1 -adrenergic receptor {{did not affect}} the barrier repair rate. On the other hand, β 2 -adrenergic receptor agonists, <b>procaterol</b> and alprenol, delayed barrier recovery and the β 2 receptor antagonist, ICI- 118551, blocked the delay. Moreover, {{topical application}} of ICI- 118551 or β 1, 2 receptor antagonist, clenbuterol alone accelerated barrier recovery. Antagonists of α 1 and α 2 receptors did not affect barrier recovery. The delay of barrier repair induced by prodaterol hydrochloride was blocked by a voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, verapamil or nifedipine. In cultured human keratinocytes, <b>procaterol</b> increased the intracellular calcium concentration and the increase was blocked by ICI- 118551 and also by verapamil or nifedipine. Topical application of ICI- 118551 partially blocked the epidermal hyperplasia induced by acetone treatment under low environmental humidity. These results suggest that the β 2 -adrenergic receptor is specifically associated with skin barrier homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Strips {{of human}} {{pulmonary}} arteries from patients undergoing surgery for lung tumour were incubated with [3 H]-noradrenaline. Subsequently, they were superfused with physiological salt solution containing cocaine and corticosterone. Tritium overflow from the strips was stimulated by transmural electrical impulses (2 Hz). The electrically evoked overflow of tritium consisted of 91 % unmetabolized [3 H]-noradrenaline, and this percentage was not altered by isoprenaline. Adrenaline (in {{the presence of}} rauwolscine), isoprenaline and the preferential beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, <b>procaterol,</b> concentration-dependently increased the electrically evoked tritium overflow. Prenalterol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist with moderate preference for beta 1 -adrenoceptors, was considerably less active than the previously mentioned agonists; noradrenaline (in the presence of rauwolscine) was ineffective. The concentration-response curve of <b>procaterol</b> was shifted to the right by the preferential beta 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118 - 551 but was not affected by the beta 1 -selective antagonist, atenolol. Propranolol, but not atenolol, produced a shift {{to the right of}} the concentration-response curve of isoprenaline. It is concluded that the sympathetic nerve fibres of the human pulmonary artery are endowed with facilitatory presynaptic beta 2 -adrenoceptors...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{direct effect}} of bronchoconstriction on cough {{receptor}} sensitivity is unknown, and the antitussive effect of beta 2 adrenergic agonists in {{man has been}} controversial. This {{study was designed to}} throw light on these questions. METHODS: The threshold of the cough response to inhaled capsaicin, a stimulant acting on C fibre endings, and tartaric acid, a chemostimulant, was measured before and 10 minutes after inhalation of methacholine, which caused a nearly 20 % fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), in 14 normal subjects (study 1), and also before and 30 minutes after inhalation of <b>procaterol</b> (30 micrograms), placebo, and saline in eight normal subjects (study 2). Progressively increasing concentrations of capsaicin and tartaric acid solutions were inhaled for 15 seconds by mouth tidal breathing at one minute intervals and cough threshold was defined as the lowest concentration of capsaicin and tartaric acid that elicited five or more coughs. RESULTS: In study 1 the geometric mean values of the cough threshold of response to capsaicin and tartaric acid before methacholine callenge, 2. 98 (GSE 1. 30) micrograms/ml and 46. 6 (1. 22) mg/ml, were not significantly {{different from those of the}} response to methacholine inhalation, 3. 45 (1. 33) micrograms/ml and 32. 9 (1. 37) mg/ml. In study 2 the geometric mean value of the cough threshold of response to capsaicin before inhalation of <b>procaterol</b> (4. 61 (GSE 1. 84) micrograms/ml) was not different from that after inhalation of <b>procaterol</b> (4. 61 (GSE 1. 84) micrograms/ml), which had significant bronchodilator effects. The cough threshold was not altered by placebo or saline. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that muscarinic receptor stimulation, bronchoconstriction, beta 2 receptor stimulation, or bronchodilation might have no direct effect on the sensitivity of the cough receptors in normal subjects...|$|E
40|$|Background: The bronchodilating {{action of}} β-agonists {{depends on the}} tone of airway smooth muscle or on spasmogen. To {{estimate}} the precise intrinsic activity of β-agonists, relaxation responses should be examined on maximally contracted airway smooth muscle. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the relaxation responses to β-agonists under different tonic conditions of airway smooth muscle. Methods: We examined the relaxation response to β-agonists on the isolated tracheal ring preparations in guinea-pigs precontracted with different concentrations of carbachol, leukotriene D 4 or substance P, and compared these results with that of spontaneously developed muscle tone. Results: Relaxation responses to β-agonists were diminished depending on the extent of carbachol-induced tone in the tracheal muscle. The degree of hyporesponsiveness was greatest in treatment with tulobuterol, <b>procaterol</b> and isoproterenol, but least with adrenaline, formoterol and salmeterol. Diminished relaxation responses to β-agonists were partially reversed by pretreatment with AF-DX 116, a muscarinic M 2 receptor antagonist. When the tracheal muscle was precontracted with different concentrations of leukotriene D 4 (1 – 100 nM) or substance P (0. 1 - 10 μM), a diminished relaxation response to <b>procaterol</b> was not observed. Conclusions: All β-agonists tested were partial agonists for relaxation of the carbachol-contracted guinea-pig tracheal muscle, where adrenaline rather than isoproterenol had the highest intrinsic activity...|$|E
40|$|Background—Previous in vivo {{studies have}} shown that -adrenoceptor {{agonists}} cause a redistribution of coronary flow away from the subendocardium; however, the underlying mechanism remains uncertain. We tested the hypothesis that a heterogeneous distribution of -adrenoceptors and their vasomotor responses exists in the coronary microcirculation across the left ventricular wall. Methods and Results—Porcine subepicardial and subendocardial arterioles (100 m) were isolated from the left ventricle and pressurized for in vitro study of vasodilation to the nonselective -adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol and the selective 2 -adrenoceptor agonist <b>procaterol.</b> Both vessel types developed a similar level of basal tone and dilated to isoproterenol and <b>procaterol.</b> However, subepicardial arterioles exhibited a much higher sensitivity and greater dilation capacity to both agonists. The isoproterenol-induced vasodilations were inhibited by glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel blocker. In contrast to isoproterenol, dilations of subepicardial and subendo-cardial arterioles to pinacidil, a KATP channel opener, were similar. In both vessel types, isoproterenol-induced dilation was inhibited by the 2 -adrenoceptor blocker ICI- 118, 551 but was insensitive to the 1 -adrenoceptor blocker atenolol. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical data revealed that 2 -adrenoceptor mRNA and protein expression, respectively, were markedly greater in subepicardial arterioles. Conclusions—This study demonstrates that selective activation of 2 -adrenoceptors elicits dilation of both subepicardia...|$|E
40|$|In {{patients}} undergoing {{coronary artery}} bypass grafting chronic β 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist treatment increased right atrial β 1 -adrenoceptor number, did not affect β 2 -adrenoceptor number and decreased muscarinic M 2 -receptor number. Concomitantly, the M 2 -receptor-mediated negative inotropic effect of carbachol was reduced, while the β 1 -adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic effect of noradrenaline was not altered. The β 2 -adrenoceptor mediated positive inotropic effect of <b>procaterol,</b> however, was markedly enhanced. We conclude that chronic β 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist treatment increases β 1 -adrenoceptor number, sensitizes β 2 -adrenoceptor function and desensitizes M 2 -receptor function in the human heart...|$|E
40|$|Relaxant {{responses}} to the beta-adrenoceptor agonists isoprenaline, fenoterol, noradrenaline or <b>procaterol</b> were obtained on isolated ring preparations of canine coronary arteries contracted with KCl (20 mM) or 5 -hydroxytryptamine (3 microM). On left circumflex arterial preparations, Schild plots for the selective antagonists atenolol (beta 1 -selective) or ICI 118, 551 (beta 2 -selective), when using noradrenaline or fenoterol as agonist, were superimposed. This suggested that only one subtype of beta-adrenoceptor {{was involved in the}} responses. The pA 2 values on left circumflex artery preparations were: atenolol, noradrenaline as agonist 6. 98, fenoterol as agonist 6. 71; ICI 118, 551, noradrenaline as agonist 6. 66, fenoterol as agonist 7. 04. These data indicated that the beta-adrenoceptor subtype was beta 1. The relative potencies of isoprenaline: noradrenaline: fenoterol were left circumflex 100 : 10. 0 : 2. 3, left ventricular branch 100 : 9. 7 : 2. 0, septal branch 100 : 10. 9 : 2. 5. These data confirmed that beta 1 -adrenoceptors were involved in the responses of all three arterial preparations. On preparations of left circumflex artery, left ventricular branch and septal branch, responses were obtained to high concentrations (1 to 100 microM) but not to low concentrations (0. 001 to 0. 1 microM) of <b>procaterol.</b> This observation confirmed the absence of beta 2 -adrenoceptors in these arteries. Responses of left circumflex artery to isoprenaline were potentiated by the extraneuronal uptake inhibitor drugs, corticosterone and metanephrine. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{choice of}} β 2 -adrenergic {{receptor}} agonists (β 2 -agonists) {{is based on}} the parameter of receptor selectivity, potency, and duration of action. The guidelines for asthma management describe nothing about intrinsic efficacy concerning the use of β 2 -agonists. Since intrinsic efficacy refers to the ability to activate β 2 -adrenergic receptors independent of agonist concentration, β 2 -adrenergic desensitization may be associated with intrinsic efficacy. However, little is currently known whether chronic administration of high intrinsic efficacy drugs interferes with the effects of β 2 -agonists as a reliever medication. In this review, the causal relationship between intrinsic efficacy and desensitization to β 2 -agonists is examined in tracheal smooth muscle using isometric tension records. Reasonable clinical use of these agonists based on these observations is discussed. When β 2 -agonists intrinsic efficacy was measured as relaxation response (the maximum inhibitory effects against 1 μM methacholine-induced contraction), their rank order was : isoproterenol = <b>procaterol</b> = formoterol > salbutamol > salmeterol >> tulobuterol. Next, the subsequent response to short-acting β 2 -agonists (<b>procaterol,</b> salbutamol) was examined after continuous exposure to long-acting β 2 -agonists (formoterol, salmeterol, tulobuterol). β 2 - adrenergic desensitization induced by these long-acting β 2 -agonists was enhanced in proportion to their intrinsic efficacies. On the other hand, under the conditions of impairment of β 2 -adrenergic receptors, reduced responsiveness to these short-acting β 2 -agonists was enhanced in inverse proportion to the intrinsic efficacy. Although the clinical relevance of these results is still unclear, our data may provide evidence that weak partial agonists are useful as a controller medication, whereas full or strong agonists are useful as a reliever medication...|$|E
