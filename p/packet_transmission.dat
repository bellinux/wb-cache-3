30|$|In CRNs, SUs {{access and}} {{communicate}} using the vacant spectrum band opportunistically. This condition sets a limitation on network resources. In a condition where the penetration of PUs’ activity is high, SUs might {{have only a}} few vacant channels for their <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Thus, they should manage their <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions</b> efficiently, possibly by reducing the number of control <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions</b> and focusing on data <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions.</b> On-demand protocols do not require periodic control packet exchanges, but they broadcast and unicast control packets in the route discovery and route maintenance procedures for active routes. In other words, by eliminating periodic control packet exchanges, on-demand protocols reduce the number of <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions</b> required by SUs. Some routing protocols based on on-demand routing in CRAHNs, such as the connectivity-based routing [17], CAODV [18], and D 2 CARP [19], add the control <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions.</b> They discover multiple paths during the route discovery. Furthermore, CAODV adds probe packets and additional control packet PU-RERR, whereas D 2 CARP broadcasts RREP packets back to the source. The effectiveness of adding control <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions</b> against the channel availability should be considered.|$|R

40|$|Relay {{selection}} {{has been}} regarded as an effective method to improve the performance of cooperative communication system. However, frequent operation of relay selection can bring enormous control message overhead and thereby decrease the performance of cooperative communication. To reduce the relay selection frequency, in this paper, we propose a relay selection scheme to choose the best relay with considering successive <b>packets</b> <b>transmission.</b> In this scheme, {{according to the length}} of data <b>packet,</b> data <b>transmission</b> rate and the estimated channel state information (CSI), the best relay is selected to maximize the number of successive <b>packets</b> <b>transmission</b> under the condition that the given symbol-error-rate (SER) is kept. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed relay selection scheme can support the operation of successive <b>packets</b> <b>transmission</b> in cooperative wireless networks and that the maximum number of successive <b>packets</b> <b>transmission</b> is affected by the different network parameters, i. e., data <b>transmission</b> rate, <b>packet</b> length and Doppler frequency at one relay node...|$|R

40|$|Reliability is {{essential}} for storing files in many applications of distributed storage systems. To maintain reliability, when a storage node fails, a new node should be regenerated by a repair process. Most of the previous results on the repair problem assume perfect (error-free) links in the networks. However, in practice, especially in a wireless network, the transmitted packets (for repair) may be lost due to, e. g., link failure or buffer overflow. We study the repair problem of distributed storage systems in packet erasure networks, where a packet loss is modeled as an erasure. The minimum repair-bandwidth, namely {{the amount of information}} sent from the surviving nodes to the new node, is established under the ideal assumption of infinite number of <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions.</b> We also study the bandwidth-storage tradeoffs in erasure networks. Then, the use of repairing storage nodes (nodes with smaller storage space) is proposed to reduce the repair-bandwidth. We study the minimal storage of repairing storage nodes. For the case of a finite number of <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions,</b> the probability of successful repairing is investigated. We show that the repair with a finite number of <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions</b> may use much larger bandwidth than the minimum repair-bandwidth. Finally, we propose a combinatorial optimization problem, which results in the optimal repair-bandwidth for the given packet erasure probability and finite <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions...</b>|$|R

Aiming to maintain the WNCSs under critical real-time traffic condition at which the WNCSs marginally meet the real-time requirements, a cross-layer design (CLD) approach is presented in this paper to adaptively adjust the control period to achieve improved channel utilization while still maintaining effective and timely <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation studies...|$|R
40|$|A new network {{architecture}} which uses several wavelengths as control channels for co-ordination of <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions</b> on data channels for single-hop WDMA networks and passive star topology is introduced in this paper. The presented multiwavelength control architecture distributes control information over the total control channels and {{in conjunction with}} a suitable network interface, reduces the headers electronic processing bottleneck at each end station. Also, the access schemes decrease the contention on data channels by avoiding part of the data channel collision. Some cases of multiple access protocols for asynchronous and synchronous (re) transmission categories are suggested. The proposed schemes adopt the slotted ALOHA protocol for the access to control and data multichannel systems in which the data <b>packets</b> <b>transmission</b> starts immediately after the control <b>packets</b> <b>transmission.</b> An analytic model is developed and analysed for performance measures evaluation based on Poisson approximations statistics and a finite population. The effect of receiver collision is analysed and estimated by the average rejection probability at destination. Also, numerical results are discussed for various numbers of control and data channels.

30|$|Finally, {{we study}} the {{influence}} of each routing metric {{on the cost of}} data packet delivery, defined as the average number of <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions</b> in the network per delivered data packet. Note that <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions</b> in the network include the transmission of AODV messages as well as data <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions</b> and retransmissions. We also test a Best-Effort (BE) approach for NST-AODV, in which only the initial route discovery takes place for a flow, and no data retransmissions are performed. Thus, we can evaluate how the routing metric affects the cost with the default and BE settings. The latter allows us to obtain a lower bound on the cost with NST-AODV, which can only be measured when the mechanisms of the protocol for connectivity maintenance and reliability are disabled. Of course, the cost benefits of this protocol variant are traded for PDR performance. With this version of the routing protocol, we measured an average PDR of between 51.9 % (with the Hop count metric) and 62.9 % (with the PATH-DR metric).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{cognitive}} networks, {{the existing}} RASR routing algorithm {{does not consider}} channel usage ratio of the PU and results in an unstable path problem. To address these issues, a new Routing Selection Algorithm in Cognitive mesh networks (RSAC) is proposed in this paper. RSAC is designed by piggybacking the information of link stability factor which {{is the sum of}} the channel usage ratio of secondary users and choosing routes based on it. It enhances the route stability, improving the success ratio of data <b>packets</b> <b>transmission,</b> reducing the average end-to-end delay.
