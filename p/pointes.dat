25|$|If {{a person}} with WPW {{experiences}} episodes of atrial fibrillation, the ECG shows a rapid polymorphic wide-complex tachycardia (without torsades de <b>pointes).</b> This combination of atrial fibrillation and WPW is considered dangerous, and most antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|Rare but serious {{adverse effects}} {{that may occur}} {{as a result of}} {{moxifloxacin}} therapy include irreversible peripheral neuropathy, spontaneous tendon rupture and tendonitis, hepatitis, psychiatric effects (hallucinations, depression), torsades de <b>pointes,</b> Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Clostridium difficile-associated disease, and photosensitivity/phototoxicity reactions.|$|E
25|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} {{can occur}} due to coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, electric shock, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis is by an electrocardiogram (ECG) showing irregular unformed QRS complexes without any clear P waves. An important differential diagnosis is torsades de <b>pointes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hypomagnesemia, also spelled hypomagnesaemia, is an {{electrolyte}} {{disturbance in}} which there is a low level of magnesium in the blood. Normal magnesium levels are between 1.46–2.68mg/dL (0.6-1.1 mmol/L) with levels less than 1.46mg/dL (0.6mmol/L) defining hypomagnesemia. Symptoms include tremor, nystagmus, seizures, and cardiac arrest including torsade de <b>pointes.</b>|$|E
25|$|FQs {{prolong the}} QT {{interval}} by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels. Prolongation of the QT interval {{can lead to}} torsades de <b>pointes,</b> a life-threatening arrhythmia, but in practice this appears relatively uncommon {{in part because the}} most widely prescribed fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) only minimally prolong the QT interval.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with other}} {{contemporary}} neighborhoods, such as Palmer Woods and the Grosse <b>Pointes,</b> Rosedale Park has more modest house and lot sizes reflecting the solidly middle- and upper-middle class {{status of the}} original homeowners. Many of these original homeowners were professionals, such as doctors and dentists, and accountants, or had white-collar jobs in the booming automobile industry.|$|E

25|$|Flore et Zéphire starred Didelot as Zephyr, {{his wife}} Rose as Flora, and Hilligsberg as Cupid. At the London premiere, the stage {{machinery}} by the engineer Liparotti used counterweighted wires to balance, support, and fly individual dancers. London audiences gasped as ballerinas balanced on demi-pointe (half toes) {{then took a}} few steps sur les <b>pointes</b> just before rising in the air and circling the stage for several minutes. Critics delivered dire warnings regarding the machines and ballerinas demanded higher wages for being sent into the air, but the delighted Diderot continued to experiment with the appartatus and sent flocks of ballerinas soaring aloft.|$|E
25|$|Trazodone {{appears to}} be {{relatively}} safer than TCAs, MAOIs, {{and a few of}} the other second-generation antidepressants in overdose situations, especially when it is the only agent taken. Fatalities are rare, and uneventful recoveries have been reported after ingestion of doses as high as 6,000–9,200mg. In one report, 9 of 294 cases of overdose were fatal, and all nine patients had also taken other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. When trazodone overdoses occur, clinicians should carefully monitor for hypotension, a potentially serious toxic effect. In a report of a fatal trazodone overdose, torsades de <b>pointes</b> and complete atrioventricular block developed, along with subsequent multiple organ failure, with a trazodone plasma concentration of 25.4mg/L on admission.|$|E
25|$|While {{a healthy}} diet is beneficial, the effect of {{antioxidant}} supplementation (vitamin E, vitamin C, etc.) or vitamins has not been shown to protect against cardiovascular disease {{and in some cases}} may possibly result in harm. Mineral supplements have also not been found to be useful. Niacin, a type of vitamin B3, may be an exception with a modest decrease in the risk of cardiovascular events in those at high risk. Magnesium supplementation lowers high blood pressure in a dose dependent manner. Magnesium therapy is recommended for people with ventricular arrhythmia associated with torsades de <b>pointes</b> who present with long QT syndrome {{as well as for the}} treatment of people with digoxin intoxication-induced arrhythmias. There is no evidence to support omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{ondansetron}} {{has been}} associated with prolongation of the QT interval, which can lead to the potentially fatal heart rhythm known as torsades de <b>pointes.</b> Although this may happen in any patient with any formulation, the risk is most salient with the injectable (intravenous) form of the drug, and increases with dose. The risk is also higher in patients taking other medicines that prolong the QT interval, as well as in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, and/or bradyarrhythmias. As such, single doses of injectable ondansetron should not exceed 16mg at one time. (Oral dosing recommendations remain intact, including the recommendation of a single 24-mg oral dose when indicated.) Electrolyte imbalances should be corrected before the use of injectable ondansetron. Patients are cautioned to seek immediate medical care if symptoms such as irregular heartbeat/palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting occur while taking ondansetron.|$|E
25|$|Over {{its history}} Grand Trunk Western has had rail yards and engine {{terminals}} located in Detroit, Battle Creek, Durand, Flat Rock, Flint, Grand Rapids, Pontiac, Port Huron, Blue Island, Illinois and Chicago. In {{each of the}} cities GTW had engine terminals and facilities for locomotive maintenance including roundhouses and turntables. Prior to 1910 the railroad constructed its major locomotive repair shops in Battle Creek and rail car repair and maintenance was handled by GTW's Port Huron car shops. Its major freight yards were Durand Yard and Pontiac Yard in the two Michigan cities that were major GTW junction <b>pointes.</b> There is also Nichols Yard in Battle Creek, Tunnel Yard in Port Huron, Torrey Yard near Flint and East Yard near the Milwaukee Junction area in the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck. City Yard was the railroad's rail yard on the Detroit riverfront adjacent to Brush Street Station and its ferry slip dock. The yard, dock and station were eventually all removed and redeveloped by 1975 for construction of the Renaissance Center. It also obtained the former Penn Central Winona Yard in Bay City when it acquired that trackage from Conrail in 1976. On Chicago's south side GTW's Elsdon Yard served as its primary yard and locomotive facility there since the railroad laid tracks into {{the city in the}} 1880s. GTW also had a smaller transfer yard south of Chicago near rail junctions Blue Island, Illinois. In 1975 GTW opened an intermodal freight terminal yard in Chicago known as Railport. The facility is in Chicago's Back of the Yards neighborhood and was formerly the Pennsylvania Railroad's Levitt Street Yard. GTW also increased intermodal operations in Detroit In 1976 when it expanded its Ferndale, Michigan railyard into an intermodal facility it called GT MoTerm. The Elsdon Yard was closed and abandoned by 1990 and has been redeveloped. Detroit, Toledo and Ironton's former hump classification yard in Flat Rock, which GTW acquired from its 1983 merger with DT still serves as an important freight hub for Canadian National. Several interlocking and crossing gate towers were also maintained by GTW through its history.|$|E

2500|$|In {{yet another}} unusual twist, it was {{reported}} by NBCNews.com in March 2012 that shortly after Clark moved to a hospital, a valuable pastel, Danseuse Faisant des <b>Pointes</b> (Dancer Making <b>Pointes),</b> by Edgar Degas, was taken from her Fifth Avenue apartment. The painting was sold to Peter Findlay Gallery and later acquired in 1993 by H Block co-founder and art collector Henry W. Bloch.

2500|$|The terms [...] "Grosse Pointe" [...] or [...] "the Pointes" [...] are ordinarily used {{to refer}} to the entire area, {{referencing}} all five individual communities, with a total population of about 46,000. The Grosse <b>Pointes</b> altogether are 10.4 square miles, bordered by Detroit on the south and west, Lake St. Clair on the east and south, Harper Woods on the west of some portions, and St. Clair Shores on the north. The cities are in eastern Wayne County, except for a very small section in Macomb County. The <b>Pointes</b> begin six miles (10km) northeast of downtown Detroit and extend several miles northeastward, in a narrow swath of land, to the edge of Wayne County. [...] The name [...] "Grosse Pointe" [...] derives from the size of the area, and its projection into Lake St. Clair.|$|E
2500|$|The 1997 film Grosse Pointe Blank is set {{almost entirely}} in Grosse Pointe and shows scenes of Detroit and Grosse Pointe, but was filmed in Chicago and Monrovia, California.

2500|$|The Grosse <b>Pointes</b> {{were first}} settled by French {{farmers in the}} 1750s after the {{establishment}} of the French [...] Fort Pontchartrain. Members of the British empire began arriving {{around the time of the}} Revolutionary War. In the 19th century Grosse Pointe continued to be the site of lakefront ribbon farms (which are long narrow farms that each adjoin the lake, useful for irrigation and early transportation needs). Beginning in the 1850s, wealthy residents of Detroit began building second homes in the Grosse Pointe area, and soon afterward, hunting, fishing, and golf clubs appeared. Some grand estates arose in the late 19th century, and with the dawn of the automobile after 1900, Grosse Pointe became a preferred suburb for business executives in addition to a retreat for wealthy Detroiters. By the 1930s, most of the southern and western areas of Grosse Pointe contained established neighborhoods, with remaining gaps and the northern sections such as Grosse Pointe Woods developing after the 1930s.|$|E
