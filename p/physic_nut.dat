R. communis showed higher CO 2 assimilation, stomatal and mesophyll conductance thanJ. curcas as light intensity and intercellular CO 2 pressure increased. On the other hand,R. communis was less effective in stomatal control in response to adverse environmental factors such as high temperature, water deficit and vapor pressure deficit, indicating lower water use efficiency. Conversely,J. curcas exhibited higher photosynthetic efficiency (gas exchange and photochemistry) and water use efficiency under these adverse environmental conditions. R. communisdisplayed higher potential photosynthesis, but exhibited a lowerin vivo Rubisco carboxylation rate (Vcmax) and maximum electron transport rate (Jmax). During {{the course of a}} typical day, in a semiarid environment, with high irradiation, high temperature and high vapor pressure deficit, but exposed to well-watered conditions, the two studied species presented similar photosynthesis. Losing potential photosynthesis, but maintaining favorable water status and increasing non-photochemical quenching to avoid photoinhibition, are important acclimation mechanisms developed byJ. curcas to cope with dry and hot conditions.

For plant growth of <b>physic</b> <b>nut,</b> the sandy soil physical properties need to be improved. In this study, the influence of addition of clay together with organic matter and intervals of irrigation to sandy soil on aggregate stability, bulk density, total soil porosity, water available content and plant growth of <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> was investigated. The rates of clay and organic matter incorporated to top sandy soil were 5 % clay + 0. 8 % organic matter and 1 O% clay + 1. 6 % organic matter. Two intervals of irrigation tested were 10 days and 20 days. The results showed that incorporation of clay together with organic matter increased aggregate stability, total soil porosity, available water content and plant growth of <b>physic</b> <b>nut.</b> Intervals of irrigation had no influence of soil physical properties and plant growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to estimate the genetic parameters and variability among accessions (half?sib families) of <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> (Jatropha curcas) {{during the early stages}} of development. For this study, 110 accessions {{in the first year of}} development of the <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> germplasm bank, maintained at Embrapa Cerrados, DF, Brazil, were evaluated in situ. The experiment was established in a randomized complete block design, with two replicates and five plants per plot arranged in rows at 4 x 2 m spacing. Grain yield, total number of branches per plant, plant height, stem diameter, canopy projection on the row, canopy projection between rows, canopy volume, number of days until first flowering and height of the first inflorescence were evaluated. Estimates of vegetative genetic parameters showed the existence of genetic variability in the <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> germplasm bank. <b>Physic</b> <b>nut</b> accessions of the germplasm bank were grouped into five similarity groups based on character divergence.

40|$|The <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> (Jatropha curcas L.) is an {{oleaginous}} species {{recently introduced}} into Brazil for energy purposes. The technological {{framework for the}} development of the <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> biodiesel productive chain in Brazil is still being set up. Two production systems are in practice at the agricultural level, the small scale manual system and the medium scale mechanized system. The objective of the present research was to assess the environmental performance of these two production systems by elaborating life-cycle inventories (LCIs) using a cradle-to-gate approach. The main environmental aspects of these LCIs are the synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, land-use changes and its emissions and the occupation of the land.

The objectives of this research were to diagnose diseases occurring on <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> in Lampung Province and to determine their intensity. Field observation was conducted in four districts: South Lampung, Tanggamus, Bandarlampung, and Tulang Bawang. Disease intensity, whether expressed as disease incidence or severity, was recorded from plant samples determined by making diagonal lines across the field on which five observation spots were made. On each spot, five plant samples were observed. Specimens were also collected and placed individually in plastic bags for laboratory observation. The diseases found on <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> in Lampung Province were cercospora leaf spot, alternaria leaf spot, fusarium wilt, and bacterial wilt. In addition, leaf malformation first thought to be viral disease was commonly found in many locations. Further mechanical transmission failed to produce similar symptom on tested plants and higher population of mites were found on malformed leaves than that in normal leaves. Based on the disease distribution and intensity, the most likely threatening disease in <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> cultivation is bacterial wilt.

40|$|<b>Physic</b> <b>nut</b> {{is one of}} {{potential}} plant which produces biofuel. It is necessary to do an intensive breeding program either conventionally or molecularly based to develop new varieties of <b>physic</b> <b>nut.</b> All this time the <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> DNA extraction methods always used liquid nitrogen to destroy the plant tissue. Liquid nitrogen is not always available, especially in remote areas. <b>Physic</b> <b>nut</b> has high latex content which makes extraction process more difficult.

40|$|An initial {{evaluation}} of early selection of <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> genotypes based on phenotypic data is presented. In order {{to predict the}} genetic gains with early selection, genetic parameters, e. g. additive genetic variance, were first obtained for grain yield along with other numerous traits. The results demonstrated that additive genetic variance exists not only for grain yield, which {{is considered to be}} the most important trait for oil and biodiesel production, but also for numerous other traits. The predicted genetic gains for grain yield, considering the selection of the 30, 20, 10 and 5 best families in the second crop year are respectively, 40. 47, 48. 43, 61. 78 and 70. 28 %. With the selection of highly yielding <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> genotypes indirectly genotypes with enhanced volume would be also selected, because yield exhibits moderate to high genetic correlations with height e canopy volume.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effect of salinity on early <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> plant development. In the first trial, <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> seeds were exposed to seven levels of salinity (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 dS m- 1) with eight repetitions, using a substrate of paper soaked with solutions of CaCl 2 and KCl. The treatments were evaluated based on the initial germination, total percentage of germination, and time necessary to germination of 50 % of the seeds. Increased salinity reduced the first germination count and delayed the time to 50 % germination. From 10 dS m- 1, there was a reduction in germination percentage. The second trial evaluated the effect of salinity on the growth of <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> seeds. This trial, carried out inside a greenhouse, with a completely randomized design, was composed of five salinity treatments (0. 02, 2, 4, 6 and 8 dS m- 1) with 5 replications.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the selectivity of different doses and mixtures of paraquat and diuron in direted-spray applications in <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> plants in greenhouse conditions. The study used a randomized block design, with five replicates. The treatments were: paraquat (200 and 600 g ha- 1), diuron (1, 000 and 2, 000 g ha- 1), paraquat + diuron (200 + 1, 000 g ha- 1), paraquat + diuron (200 + 2, 000 g ha- 1), paraquat + diuron (600 + 1, 000 g ha- 1), paraquat + diuron (600 + 2, 000 g ha- 1) and a control (no application).

40|$|The NAC {{proteins}} (NAM, ATAF 1 / 2 and CUC 2) are plant-specific transcriptional regulators {{that have}} a conserved NAM domain in the N-terminus. They are involved in various biological processes, including both biotic and abiotic stress responses. In the present study, a total of 100 NAC genes (JcNAC) were identified in <b>physic</b> <b>nut</b> (Jatropha curcas L.). Based on phylogenetic analysis and gene structures, 83 JcNAC genes were classified as members of, or proposed to be diverged from, 39 previously predicted orthologous groups (OGs) of NAC sequences. <b>Physic</b> <b>nut</b> has a single intron-containing NAC gene subfamily that has been lost in many plants.
