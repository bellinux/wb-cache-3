RMS and peak voltages have different relationships to each other depending on the wave shape and IEEE 400.2 uses the peak voltage level to equate the wave shapes. Frequency ranges used are within the range of 0.01 Hz to 0.1 Hz, where frequency selection depends on the load presented by the cable. Test voltage levels are either calculated using a multiple of the cable's nominal phase-phase voltage or via tables in IEEE 400.2; typically they are in the range of 1.5 U0 to 3 U0. The VLF cable testing time varies from 15 to 60 minutes. IEEE Guide 400.2 establishes some suggested test voltages and times.

40|$|Primary Backup Replication (PBR) is {{the most}} common {{technique}} to achieve availability in distributed systems. However, primary failure remains a crucial problem that threatens availability. When the primary fails, backup nodes in the system have to elect a new primary node in order to maintain adequate system’s operation. During election, the system suffers from transaction loss, communication overhead due to messages exchange necessary to preserve data consistency, and a notable delay caused by the execution of Leader Election Algorithms (LEA). Primary failures can be unpredictable (i. e., unplanned), such as primary node crashes and network outages, or predictable (i. e., planned), such as primary’s scheduled shutdown to perform routine maintenance or software upgrade. Traditionally, PBR employ LEA to recover from both unplanned and planned outages. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol, called Primary Shift Replication (PSR), to avoid election during planned outages. PSR shifts the primary role from the current primary to another scheduled node (without election) when a <b>planned</b> <b>outage</b> is about to occur. Number of messages and communication time required to shift the primary node to another node is much less than number of messages and time required to perform leader election; therefore, PSR improves system’s availability.

Suppliers and consumers that respond to high prices that are later determined to be incorrect and replaced by lower administered prices may lose significant production and income and subsequently become hesitant to respond to price signals otherwise provided. To increase their confidence in the price signals, they market participants would like to be compensated for losses in the event that prices are corrected/administered and they would like to be notified of potential price corrections as close to real-time as possible. Non-market participants who independently respond to pricing signals in the market may also suffer from a loss of production and income as a result of incorrectly posted prices. However, the issues related to non-market participants will not be included inunder this particular discussionissue.

More specifically, the IMO will administer prices under in the following three situations: • Failure to publish prices due to a forced or <b>planned</b> <b>outage</b> to the hardware, software or communications systems that support the dispatch algorithm • The published prices are incorrect due to incorrect inputs to the dispatch algorithm • Market suspension There {{have been a number of}} occasions when prices have been administered, such as during the market suspension resulting from the August 2003 blackout or, more typically, on occasions when market related systems fail or are on outage.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how the unavailability for OKG {{will be affected}} by the planned replacement of the 400 kV substation at Simpevarp. The evaluation has been based on calculation of unavailability due to both faults and maintenance, fault and maintenance frequencies and estimated costs for the different substation designs. Four different variations of two-breaker arrangement designs have been simulated and been compared to simulations of the existing substation. To perform the calculations a program has been developed in java that simulates the different substation designs. The fault probabilities used in this study has primarily been taken from fault statistics for the Swedish grid but has also been compared to the assumptions used in other substation reliability studies. The results of this thesis show that the unavailability is likely to be higher for the proposed twobreaker arrangement design without separate disconnectors compared to the existing substation. When the two-breaker arrangement simulation instead included separate disconnectors the unavailability was found to be lower for the two-breaker arrangement design compared to the existing substation. The study also showed that the two-breaker arrangement designs had considerably lower fault frequencies compared to the existing substation. The thesis found that the unavailability that will be caused by maintenance can be significant and are likely to be higher than the unavailability caused by faults. The amount of unavailability caused by maintenance was, however, found to be uncertain because a large part of it can be performed during <b>planned</b> <b>outage.</b> Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} two-breaker arrangement design with and without disconnectors had similar expected present value of costs if the maintenance costs were excluded.

40|$|In this work, an {{investigation}} of the role played by line distance protection zone 3 towards voltage instability resulting into a major system blackout of large power network was carried out. This is with a view of finding out the scenarios that can lead to voltage collapse with all the three zones of the distance protection relays activated. The motivation for doing so is that; recent large power blackouts generated lots of controversial debates in Europe and in the United States and the concept of voltage collapse is still a subject of research under investigation. In addition, there is a disagreement over the exact nature of the negative forces that triggered the big blackouts. This raised several questions as “who to be blamed”. Among several others distance protection zone 3 has been blamed for the majority of voltage collapse incidence that took place in 2003. The study begins with developing and solving the load flow of the simple IEEE 14 -bus test system. To create a scenario similar to the actual blackout in 2003 Sweden/Denmark a detailed dynamic simulation of standard CIGRE Nordic 32 -bus network which closely resembles Swedish network is carried out and the critical lines that led to cascaded tripping were identified using PSS/E software. As a short term solution to voltage collapse, a mitigation scheme incorporating underfrequency relays and undervoltage relays is implemented. According to the findings of this work, within 2. 52 seconds with respect to the triggering event all the critical lines tripped in cascade and 370 milliseconds is the time lag observed between the commencements of the cascaded trippings to the last event. As an additional example from the simulation result, the reactive power losses increases for the same loading condition by 47 % during the pre-fault condition when tap changers are blocked and raised to 52 % when tap changers are in operation. It was observed that zone 3 distance relay operation should not be entirely blamed for the cascaded trippings because even when zone 3 and zone 1 were blocked, the voltage collapse still occurred in zone 2, since at that critical condition the apparent impedance seen by the distance relay traverse through all the three zones. Moreover, it is shown that switching out of major transmission lines is associated with large increase in power losses and if these losses are determined using simulation software prior to granting a <b>planned</b> <b>outage</b> and adequate reactive compensation is provided, then the need for load shedding and risk of voltage collapse could be reduced...|$|E
40|$|Japan has {{recently}} been urged to implement measures to increase utility factors for nuclear power plants {{in order to address}} energy security and greenhouse gas emission cuts. The average utility factor for Japan's nuclear power plants in 2009 rose from 58. 0 % in 2008 to 64. 7 %, still below levels in other major nuclear power generation countries including South Korea and the United States. Some major foreign nuclear power generation countries have kept their utility factors for nuclear plants at high levels at or above 90 % since 1990, while others including the United States and South Korea have raised their respective factors since 2000 following the 1990 s when their factors were close to the Japanese level. The latter group made ambitious efforts to raise these factors. Specifically, the United States has shortened <b>planned</b> <b>outage</b> time for periodic maintenance and repairs of nuclear power plants year by year as the nuclear industry and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have tried to take advantage of risk information for optimizing instrument-by-instrument inspection frequencies and for expanding the scope for preventive maintenance during operation (PMO). Unplanned outage time to solve nuclear plant instrument issue has also been shortened substantially thanks to the reduction of the trouble incidence rate and shorter repair and restart times. The United States has also tried to lengthen operational cycle periods, adopting 18 -to- 24 -month cycles for many plants. In a bid to shorten plant outage time, South Korea has promoted not only the improvement of operational skills and the introduction of sophisticated instruments but also the enhancement of maintenance know-how including the reform of maintenance and repair processes and the improvement of inspection work steps. Overseas cases for the restart of nuclear plant operations from an unplanned plant outage include those in multiple countries in which thorough investigations into minor troubles or measures for their future prevention were not necessarily required for restarting plants. As far as our analysis generally indicates, local governments are not authorized to examine nuclear plant safety in foreign countries. An apparent dominant view in foreign countries is that it would be reasonable to utilize infrastructure as much as possible once safety regulation authorities conclude that a plant restart would have no safety problems. As existing nuclear power plants have been required to be effectively utilized under the top priority on safety, some countries have continuously achieved high utility factors for nuclear plants, between 85 % and 95 % over 10 to 20 years while meeting safety standards at the same level as in Japan. In considering specific measures to effectively utilize existing nuclear reactors, Japan should take full account of these overseas efforts and promote discussions on overall Japanese nuclear energy and safety approaches. nuclear power, Japan, utility factor...|$|E
