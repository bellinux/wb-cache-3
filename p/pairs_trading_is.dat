50|$|<b>Pairs</b> <b>trading</b> or <b>pair</b> <b>trading</b> <b>is</b> a long-short, ideally market-neutral {{strategy}} enabling traders {{to profit}} from transient discrepancies in relative value of close substitutes. Unlike {{in the case of}} classic arbitrage, in case of <b>pairs</b> <b>trading,</b> the law of one price cannot guarantee convergence of prices. This is especially true when the strategy is applied to individual stocks - these imperfect substitutes can in fact diverge indefinitely. In theory the long-short nature of the strategy should make it work regardless of the stock market direction. In practice, execution risk, persistent and large divergences, as well as a decline in volatility can make this strategy unprofitable {{for long periods of time}} (e.g. 2004-7). It belongs to wider categories of statistical arbitrage, convergence trading, and relative value strategies.|$|R
40|$|Objective of {{the study}} is to further {{investigate}} <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> strategy on the U. S. equity markets and the possible explanations for the strategy profits. The main contribution {{of the study}} to the existing literature is to provide a thorough empirical study of <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits and to examine the unexplored link between <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profit and short-term return reversals. In addition, this thesis studies <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits in different market conditions and the exposure of the <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits to known market risk factors. The data used in the empirical study comprises of daily stock market return data for the S&P 500 equity index constituents from December 1967 to December 2009. The data set is extracted from Center for Research in Security Price (CRSP) database, consisting of observations for 10824 days and 1331 unique S&P 500 constituents. The main findings of the thesis show that the <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> strategy yields markedly higher risk adjusted returns compared to the S&P 500 benchmark index, which are comparable in size to the earlier studies on the topic. According to the return analysis, the strategy on average yields small but positive returns for majority of the periods, but the returns are at least to some extent driven by small number of high return periods. I also find that <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits persist over time, contrary to earlier studies, and profits to be dependent on the overall market conditions. Although the returns show some time variation, the returns persist also to this day. The <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> profits <b>are</b> highly exposed to funding liquidity risk as well as overall equity market volatility, which imply that arbitrageurs are constrained to enforce relative pricing discrepancies. The exposure the overall market conditions might prove trading according to the <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> strategy difficult in practice.

Deviations in prices are monitored closely and used as basis for changing positions, taking advantage of market inefficiencies to obtain some profits.

The superior performance is more pronounced prior to accounting for transaction costs. There is no evidence to suggest industry homogeneity in pairs trading improves portfolio performance.

40|$|The {{turbulent}} market environment experienced {{over the}} last decades has attracted the broad interest of institutional and retail investors towards non-directional and absolute return investment strategies.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> rule. The idea is to monitor two historically correlated securities.

Such a strategy bets the "spread" between the two would eventually converge. In this paper, a difference of the pair is governed by a mean-reverting model. The objective <b>is</b> to <b>trade</b> the <b>pair</b> so as to maximize an overall return. A fixed commission cost is charged with each transaction. In addition, a stop-loss limit is imposed as a state constraint. The associated HJB equations (quasi-variational inequalities) are used to characterize the value functions. It is shown that {{the solution to the}} optimal stopping problem can be obtained by solving a number of quasi-algebraic equations. We provide a set of sufficient conditions in terms of a verification theorem. Numerical examples are reported to demonstrate the results. Comment: 4 figure...|$|R
5000|$|While it is {{commonly}} agreed that individual stock prices are difficult to forecast, there is evidence suggesting {{that it may be}} possible to forecast the price—the spread series—of certain stock portfolios. A common way to attempt this is by constructing the portfolio such that the spread series is a stationary process. To achieve spread stationarity in the context of <b>pairs</b> <b>trading,</b> where the portfolios only consist of two stocks, one can attempt to find a cointegration irregularities between the two stock price series who generally show stationary correlation. This irregularity is assumed to be bridged soon and forecasts are made in the opposite nature of the irregularity. This would then allow for combining them into a portfolio with a stationary spread series. Regardless of how the portfolio is constructed, if the spread series is a stationary processes, then it can be modeled, and subsequently forecast, using techniques of time series analysis. Among those suitable for <b>pairs</b> <b>trading</b> <b>are</b> Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models, autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models and (vector) error correction models.

40|$|<b>Pairs</b> <b>trading</b> <b>is</b> a comparative-value form of {{statistical}} arbitrage designed to exploit temporary random departures from equilibrium pricing between two shares. However, {{the strategy is}} not riskless. Market events as well as poor statistical modeling and parameter estimation may all erode potential profits. Since conventional loss limiting trading strategies are costly, a preferable situation is to integrate loss limitation within the statistical modeling itself. This paper uses cointegration principles to develop a procedure that embeds a minimum profit condition within a pairs trading strategy. We derive the necessary conditions for such a procedure and then use them to define and implement a five-step procedure for identifying eligible trades. The statistical validity of the procedure is verified through simulation data. Practicality is tested through actual data. The results show that, at reasonable minimum profit levels, the protocol does not greatly reduce trade numbers or absolute profits relative to an unprotected trading strategy...|$|E
