40|$|A {{possible}} butyltin contamination {{source in}} wine was studied in this paper. <b>Agglomerated</b> <b>cork</b> stoppers, which were produced in Portugal, Spain, and Italy, used in wine bottles were examined. The domestic cork products, cork granules, and mucus used for cork products were also analyzed. The levels of mono- and dibutyltin compounds in corks {{were found in}} the range from < 0. 0024 to 3. 3 and from < 0. 0029 to 6. 7 mug of Sn/g, respectively. A low level of tributyltin contamination was also found in 2 of 31 tested samples. The presence of butyltin compounds in <b>agglomerated</b> <b>cork</b> stoppers was confirmed by GC-MS. Experimental results indicated that all overseas <b>agglomerated</b> <b>cork</b> stoppers studied contained mono- and/or dibutyltins. Butyltins were not detected in cork granules, mucus, most of the natural cork stoppers, and domestic <b>agglomerated</b> <b>cork</b> products. The concentrations of mono- and dibutyltins increased with the time in a 30 -day experiment, showing that butyltin compounds can leach from <b>agglomerated</b> <b>cork</b> to the wine.

For both natural and <b>agglomerated</b> <b>corks,</b> the Young's modulus was significantly and similarly affected by hydration, with a constant plateau value up to 50 % relative humidity (RH) and a mean value around 22 and 14 MPa, respectively. For higher RH, the increase in water content leads to {{a decrease in the}} material rigidity (Young's modulus < 10 MPa), which is attributed to water clusters formation between polymer chains. Technical stoppers revealed a similar profile, but with a much smaller impact of the water content and with overall lower Young's moduli values, around 5 MPa, throughout the RH range. The stiffness of synthetic closures was not affected by hydration, in agreement with the hydrophobic behavior of polyethylene. Differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis allowed us to identify a glass transition temperature (T (g)) in cork (around 0 A degrees C), and another one in <b>agglomerated</b> <b>cork</b> and technical stoppers (close to - 45 A degrees C, corresponding to additives).

40|$|Quercus Suber L. is {{a native}} species of the Mediterranean region {{yielding}} a thick bark, known as cork, used mainly {{in the production of}} wine stoppers. The levels of trace elements are an important component of quality, safety and origin of the <b>agglomerated</b> <b>corks</b> stoppers in contact with food. In the present work the concentration of the following elements was determined: Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Selenium (Se), Lead (Pb), Iron (Fe), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu) and Manganese (Mn). Since almost no published work can be found on this subject it was necessary to study all stages of the process. Sampling was made by the producer who sent representative bagged samples to the laboratory. Subsequently it was necessary to have a reliable sample preparation method before the analysis. To do so the sample preparation step was optimized by employing and comparing two distinct methods to destroy the organic matrix: dry ashing and microwave digestion. Afterwards samples were analysed by two different techniques, trace elements were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and the remaining ones by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). Both techniques enable the quantification of elements with ICP-MS allowing lower detection limits (ppb and/or ppt) than ICP-OES (ppm) in a complex matrix such as <b>agglomerated</b> <b>cork</b> stoppers. Several elements were found in the sample. These elements may originate from the cork or by contamination of the manufacturing process of <b>agglomerated</b> <b>cork</b> stoppers.

The main {{goal of this}} study is to evaluate the energy absorbing capabilities of both materials. A comparison with correspondent hollow-sections is performed. For the purpose of this comparison the authors consider the energy dissipation and the geometrical profiles of the deformed tubular structures. In order to perform these studies, three-dimensional finite element modelling dynamic analyses are carried out using both the ABAQUSTM/Explicit and LS-DYNATM FEA codes. The authors try to achieve an in-depth study of the structural crash behaviour of tubular structures, during which energy needs to be absorbed in a controlled manner. A comprehensive comparative numerical study of the crush behaviour of Aluminium foam and agglomerate cork-filled sections undergoing axial compressive loading is performed.

40|$|The thermal {{insulation}} in targeted textile substrates for home textiles assumes particular interest nowadays. Increasing performance and decreasing thickness are critical challenges {{to provide the}} required comfort to users during their rest period. Thermal insulation {{is associated with the}} phenomenon of heat absorption/desorption influencing the insulation value in fibrous material, since fibers absorb or release moisture, depending on their chemical composition. Thus, regarding {{thermal insulation}}, there are two major parameters to take into account: the conductivity and heat resistance. The main objective of this work is to study the performance of different fibrous structures for home textiles applications in terms of thermal insulation. The innovative structures considered within this study include non-woven fabrics produced with wool and hollow polyester fibers incorporating cork. Non-woven structures have been prepared in different compositions including 75 %/ 25 % wool and hollow polyester, 50 %/ 50 % wool and hollow polyester, blended with 25 mm cork granules size in proportions of 5 % and 10 % or with an <b>agglomerated</b> <b>cork</b> panel of 0, 8 mm. After production, samples were tested for their thermal behavior using Alambeta equipment. Results show that the non-woven composition influences greatly the thermal performance and the best result is obtained for sample with 50 / 50 % wool and hollow polyester...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to study}} the chemical and physical modifications of natural <b>cork</b> <b>agglomerate</b> after plasma treatment using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). Different experimental techniques were {{used to evaluate the}} surface alterations of the pretreated samples with DBD plasma, as well as the adsorption and adhesion of microcapsules in the substrate, namely, static and dynamic contact angle, surface energy, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Plasma discharge greatly increases the wettability and surface energy of the samples. Chemical and physical analyses of the <b>cork</b> <b>agglomerate</b> confirmed considerable surface modification. All these surface changes of the cork after plasma treatment led to a remarkable increase in microcapsule adsorption and adhesion when compared with the untreated cork sample...|$|R
40|$|Cork is {{a complex}} natural {{cellular}} material with quite unknown or not well understood properties. It {{is available in the}} natural and in the agglomerate form and it is an ecological and very durable material. That is why it is used today as thermal and acoustic insulator, as a seal and as an energy-absorbing medium in flooring, shoes and packaging, among others. However, the application of <b>agglomerate</b> <b>cork</b> as filler inside structural thin-walled sections, in order to increase the energy absorption, has not been much explored. Dynamic experimental tests were carried out on empty and micro-agglomerate cork-filled tubes with 22 and 50  mm in internal diameter (D) and length (L), respectively, and numerical simulations were performed with the finite element method software LS-DYNATM, showing good agreement in terms of load-displacement curves and deformation patterns. Having validated the numerical model with experiments, the finite element model was used to undertake a systematic study of circular tubular structures impacted at 10  m/s. The load-deformation characteristics, energy-absorption response and collapse mode transitions of empty and cork-filled aluminium tubes with varying diameters and thicknesses (t), lengths of 25, 300 and 350  mm, but with constant slenderness ratios D/t and D/L were thus studied. Relevant comparisons were raised, showing that the slenderness ratios are very important parameters that globally govern the percentage increase in energy absorbed by tubular structures after cork-filling during an impact loading.

40|$|This {{research}} {{intends to}} study the influence of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma treatment on the adsorption of Phase Change Materials (PCM) microcapsules applied to <b>cork</b> <b>agglomerate</b> laminated with a polymer membrane. Several experimental techniques were used to evaluate cork and membrane surface modification after plasma treatment and the influence on the microcapsules adsorption, namely, Static and Dynamic Contact Angle, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Tensile Strength. The plasma treatment greatly increases the hydrophilicity of both materials, justifying that more microcapsules are adsorbed on this composite.
