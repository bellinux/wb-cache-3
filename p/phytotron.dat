40|$|Effects of {{increased}} CO 2 and temperature on powdery mildew (Podosphaera xanthii) of zucchini (Cucurbita pepo), were evaluated under controlled conditions. Zucchini plants were grown in <b>phytotrons</b> under four different simulated climatic conditions: 450 ppm of CO 2 at standard (18 °C night, 24 °C day) and elevated temperatures (22 °C night, 28 °C day), elevated CO 2 (800 ppm) with standard temperature and elevated CO 2 (800 ppm) with elevated temperature (4 °C higher than standard). Physiological responses of zucchini and pathogen development were studied. Under elevated CO 2 both healthy and infected zucchini plants grew better when temperature was lower. Elevated CO 2 generally caused {{no significant differences}} in pathogen development or disease severity, whereas elevated temperature stimulated the development of the pathogen.

40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} method is presented for {{the determination of}} proline in grape berries. Following acidification with formic acid, proline is derivatized by heating at 100 degrees C for 15 min with 3 % ninhydrin in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the absorbance, which is stable for at least 60 min, is read at 520 nm.

40|$|Abstract: Changes of {{the content}} of starch, amylose and the {{activities}} of 3 key enzymes involved in starch synthetic metabolism in developing rice grains under four different temperature in <b>phytotrons</b> during grain filling stage of two aromatic rice varieties were studied. The results showed that compared with that under the lower temperature (21 ℃ and 23 ℃), the content of starch and amylose and the activities of SBE and GBSS under higher temperatures (26 ℃and 30 ℃) were generally higher {{at the beginning of the}} grain filling stage and obviously lower during the middle and late grain filling stage, with the exception of the activity SSS which were always higher under lower temperature. The relationship between the changes of activities of SSS, SBE and the variation of starch accumulating rate was very close and so did the relationship between GBSS activity and the amylose content. The lower activities of SSS, SBE and GBSS during the middle and late grain filling stage may be the key physiological factors which lead to the poorer progress quality and appearance quality of aromatic rice under high temperature...|$|R
5000|$|Phytotrons unified and {{extended}} earlier piecemeal efforts to claim {{total control of}} the whole environment. In both walk-in rooms and smaller reach-in cabinets, phytotrons produced and reproduced whole complex climates of many variables. In the first phytotrons each individual room was held at a constant unique temperature. The Australian <b>phytotron,</b> for example, had rooms maintaining 9°C, 12°C, 16°C, 20°C, 23°C, 26°C, 30°C, 34°C. Because {{some of the earliest}} controlled environment experiments showed that plants reacted differently in daytime temperatures and nighttime temperatures, the first experiments to observe the effect(s) of varying the daytime versus the nighttime temperature saw experimenters move their plants from higher to lower temperatures {{over the course of a}} daily, or any other variable or constant, routine. This rendered the variable “temperature” experimentally controllable. Even a brute force approach that tested each successive environmental variable and every variety of plant would serve to pinpoint specific environmental conditions to maximize growth. Expecting that more knowledge would surely come from greater technology, the next generation of phytotrons expanded in technological reach, in their ranges of environmental variables, and also in the degree of control over each variable. The <b>phytotron</b> in Stockholm offered a humidity controlled room and a custom built computer, as well as a low temperature room that extended the temperature range down to -25°C for the study of Nordic forests. After that, <b>phytotron</b> technology compressed whole environments into smaller cabinets able to be set to any desired combination of environmental conditions, which are still in use today.|$|E

40|$|Parent {{plants of}} woody species can créate special microenvironmental {{conditions}} in their neighbourhood that modify {{factors such as}} light intensity, litter accumulation or nutrient levéis. These conditions may be beneficial or not for their seeds to germinate, depending on trie species strategy. As a N-fixing species, Retama sphaerocarpa can exert its influence on soil nitrogen levéis as well as over light intensity. Moreover, adult plants understorey constitute a refuge for many herbaceous species, which can strong-ly compete with recently-established R. sphaerocarpa seedlings. Our objective was to test if the effect of parent-created microen-vironment is positive for R. sphaerocarpa seed germination under different meteorological conditions. Previously scarified seeds {{were used for the}} experiment, set to germinate in two different <b>phytotrons,</b> at 14 °C and 19 °C (simulating temperature conditions of early and late arrival of autumn rains), under full light and shade, and with three levéis of KN 03.

The results seem to confirm our initial hypothesis about the favourable conditions provided by parent plants for R. sphaerocarpa seeds' germination. The effects on germination speed suggest that, under adult plant canopies, seedlings could have at least an initial advantage in their competition with seedlings of herbaceous species of the understorey, and the interactive effect between light and nitrate points to a colonisation strategy of open zones for this species...|$|R

Among winter cover crops, the highest and the lowest amounts of C accumulated were by bellbean (Vicia faba L.), 597 g/m 2 and white clover (Trifolium repens), 149 g/m 2, respectively, in the QFS soil. Among summer cover crops, sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) accumulated the largest quantity of C (481 g/m 2), while that by castorbean (Ricinus communis) was 102 g/m 2 at 30 o C in the KGL soil. The mean net C remained in the residues following the 127 d decomposition were 187 g/m 2 of C (73 % of the total) and 91 g/m 2 (52 % of the total) for the winter and summer cover crops, respectively. Following a whole cycle of winter and summer cover crops grown, the mean soil organic C (SOC) increased by 13. 8 and 39. 1 % in the KGL and QFS soil, respectively, compared to the respective soils before.

Abstract: Chalk in rice grains leads to a significant loss in the proportion of marketable grains in a harvested crop, leading to a significant financial loss to rice farmers and traders. To identify the genetic basis of chalkiness, two sets of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from reciprocal crosses between Lemont and Teqing were used to find stable QTLs for chalkiness. The RILs were grown in seven locations in Asia and Latin American and in two controlled environments in <b>phytotrons.</b> A total of 32 (21) and 46 (22) QTLs for DEC and PGWC, most of them explaining more than 10  % of phenotypic variation, were detected based on single environment analysis in T/L (L/T) population, respectively. Seven (2) and 7 (3) QTLs for DEC and PGWC were identified in the T/L (L/T) population using joined analysis across all environments, respectively. Six major QTLs clusters were found on five chromosomes: 1, 2, 4, 5 and 11. The biggest cluster at id 4007289 -RM 252 on Chr 04 was a novelty, including 16 and 4 QTLs detected by single environment analysis and joint mapping across all environments, respectively.

40|$|Climatic {{and soil}} factors are {{limiting}} rice growth in many countries. In Vietnam, a steep gradient of temperature is observed from the North to the South, and acid sulphate soils are frequently devoted to rice production. We have therefore attempted {{to understand how}} temperature affects rice growth in these problem soils, by comparison with rice grown in nutrient solution. Two varieties of rice, IR 64 and X 2, were cultivated in <b>phytotrons</b> at 19 / 21 degrees C and 28 / 32 degrees C (day/night) for 56 days, after 3 weeks preculture in optimal conditions. Two soils from the Mekong Delta were tested. Parallel with the growing experiments, these two soils were incubated in order to monitor redox potential (Eh), PH, soluble Al and Fe, soluble, and available P. Tillering retardation at 20 degrees C compared to 30 degrees C was similar in nutrient solutions and in soils. The effect of temperature on increasing plant biomass was more marked in solutions than in soils. The P concentrations in roots and shoots were higher at 20 degrees C than at 30 degrees C, {{to such an extent}} that detrimental effect was suspected in plants grown in solution at the lowest temperature. The translocation of Fe from roots to shoots was stimulated upon rising temperature, both in solutions and in soils. This led to plant death on the most acid soil at 30 degrees C. Indeed, the accumulation of Fe in plants grown on soils was enhanced by the release of Fe 2 + due to reduction of Fe(III) -oxihydroxides. Severe reducing conditions were created at 30 degrees C: redox potential (Eh) dropped rapidly down to about 0 V. At 20 degrees C, E(h) did not drop below about 0. 2 V, which is a value well in the range of Fe(III) /Fe(II) buffering. Parallel to Eh drop, PH increased up to about 6 - 6. 5 at 30 degrees C, which prevented plants from Al toxicity, even in the most acid soil. Phosphate behavior was obviously related to Fe-dynamics: more reducing conditions at 30 degrees C have resulted in enhancement of available P, especially in the most acid soil...|$|R

Sensitivity analyses revealed that the model was most sensitive to changes in parameters relating to carbohydrate concentration in the plant and nitrogen uptake rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of nematodes on nodulation of soybean varied {{according to their}} modes of parasitism. In the greenhouse, nodule formation was stimulated by the endoparasites, Meloidogyne hapla and Pratylenchus penetrans, but was inhibited slightly by the ectoparasite, Belonolaimus longicaudatus. In an experiment under controlled conditions in a <b>phytotron,</b> Heterodera glycines severely inhibited nodule formation, whereas plants inoculated with B. longicaudatus and P. penetrans had more nodules per g root than nematode-free plants. Nitrogen-fixing capacity, however, was inhibited by all three nematode species. Different light sources used in the <b>phytotron</b> experiment also influenced growth and nodulation of soybean. A fluorescent plus incandescent light regime resulted in plants with the greatest shoot weight, pod number, and nodules per g root. Plants grown under Lucalox lamps had excessive stem elongation...|$|E

40|$|In Iran, a {{large number}} of Rosa species have been exposed to {{extinction}} and therefore preservation techniques are necessary to safeguard their future. In the present investigation, the objectives were to optimize the micropropagation and medium-term conservation of one of these wild species, Rosa pulverulenta. At proliferation stage, the maximum number of new leaves (9. 6) were produced on the medium containing 4 ƒÊM BAP + 0 ƒÊM GA 3, whereas the maximum number of axillary shoots (4. 1) were observed in the medium containing 4 ƒÊM BAP + 3 ƒÊM GA 3. The results for rooting experiments suggested that the highest increase in stem height (49. 5 mm) at the acclimatization stage was observed in plantlets treated with 1 ƒÊM IBA + 0. 5 ƒÊM NAA during the rooting stage. Comparing the refrigerator and phytotronconditions for medium-term conservation of in vitro plantlets indicated that although the refrigerator conditions resulted in lower growth rate compared with the <b>phytotron,</b> the survival rate in refrigerator (100 %) was significantly higher than <b>phytotron</b> (87. 5 %). Furthermore, the growth rate of the plantlets from the refrigerator was accelerated during the recovery period and verged on to the ones stored in the <b>phytotron.</b> No Ira, um numero grande de especies de Rosa sao expostas a extincao. Por causa disto, astecnicas de preservacao sao necessarias para garantir o futuro d estas mesmas especies. Nesta investigacao, os objetivos foram aperfeicoar a micropropagacao e preservar durante medio prazo uma destas especies, Rosa pulverulenta. No estadio de proliferacao, o numero maximo de novas folhas (9, 60) foi produzido no meio contendo 4 ƒÊM BAP + 0 ƒÊM GA 3, mas o numero maximo de gemas axilares foi observado no meio com 4 ƒÊM BAP + 3 ƒÊM GA 3. Os resultados obtidos permitiram inferir que o maior aumento na altura de haste (49, 5 mm) durante o estadio de climatizacao foi observado nos explantes tratados com 1 ƒÊM IBA + 0, 5 ƒÊM NAA durante oenraizamento. Observa-se que embora a geladeira tenha proporcionado uma menor taxa de crescimento, a sobrevivencia em medio prazo foi maior (100, 00 %) do que no <b>phytotron</b> (87, 50 %). Alem disto, a taxa de crescimento dos explantes que foram mantidos na geladeira foi acelerada durante o periodo de recuperacao e ficaram proximas daquelas mantidas no <b>phytotron...</b>|$|E
