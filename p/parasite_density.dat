The prospective panel was run together with OptiMAL (Pf-pLDH/pan-pLDH) and SDFK 60 (histidine-rich protein- 2 (HRP- 2) /pan-pLDH). Results Overall sensitivities for P. falciparum tested retrospectively and prospectively were 67. 9 % and 78. 8 %, reaching 100 % and 94. 6 % at <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> > 1, 000 /μl. Sensitivity at <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> ≤ 100 /μl was 9. 1 %. Overall sensitivities for Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale were 86. 7 % and 80. 0 % (retrospectively) and 92. 9 % and 76. 9 % (prospectively), reaching 94. 7 % for both species (retrospective panel) at <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> > 500 /μl. Sensitivity for Plasmodium malariae was 21. 4 %. Species mismatch occurred in 0. 7 % of samples (3 / 411) and was limited to non- falciparum species erroneously identified as P. falciparum. None of the Plasmodium negative samples in the retrospective panel reacted positive. Compared to OptiMAL and SDFK 60, SDFK 40 showed lower sensitivities for P. falciparum, but better detection of P. ovale.

To {{establish}} a simple {{definition of a}} malaria attack based on blood <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> and other explanatory covariates, a cohort study was conducted from 1993 to 1996 in the Madagascar highlands undergoing a low seasonal transmission of falciparum malaria. Using logistic regression, the explanatory {{variables found to be}} significantly related to the risk of fever are <b>parasite</b> <b>density,</b> age, season, and year. However, and in contrast with other studies, we found no evidence of a clear cutoff in <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> values consistent with the concept of “pyrogenic threshold ” despite a gradual increase of the risk of fever with increasing <b>parasite</b> <b>density.</b> Furthermore, the model evidenced an individualdependent relationship at a given age.

40|$|Background: Malaria {{remains a}} major health hazard {{in the modern}} world, {{particularly}} in developing countries. In Plasmodium falciparum malaria, {{there is a direct}} correlation between asexual erythrocytic stage <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> and disease severity. Accordingly, the correlations between <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> and various clinical presentations, severity, and outcome were examined in falciparum malaria in India. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in a tertiary health-care center in North India. Of 100 cases of falciparum malaria, 65 patients were male and 35 were female. A total of 54 patients were in the uncomplicated group and 46 patients were in the complicated malaria group. Results: Fever, anemia, icterus, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and hepatosplenomegaly were common clinical findings. All clinical findings were significantly more common in the complicated malaria group and patients with a high <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> than in the uncomplicated group and those with a low <b>parasite</b> <b>density.</b> All patients in the uncomplicated malaria group had a <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> of 5 %, and the difference between groups was statistically significant. The incidence of cerebral malaria was significantly higher in cases with a high parasite density; 58. 33 % mortality was observed in these cases. Cerebral malaria and hyperbilirubinemia was the most frequently encountered combination of complications. Conclusions: In P. falciparum malaria, <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> was associated with complications and poor clinical outcomes.

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} to assess malaria {{prevalence}} in relation to rainfall pattern in different localities of Entebbe Municipality, Uganda. A cross sectional study was conducted amongst the local community residing in the area from January 2003 to January 2004 to investigate the incidence and intensity of malaria infection. Methods: Thick and thin blood smears were made from each patient with fever (body temperature> 37. 5 o C). The slides were examined microscopically for malaria parasites. A total of 616 residents aged 2 to 50 years were registered {{in the study by}} name, age, sex and residential location. Spearman correlation coefficient (r) was used to evaluate relationship between <b>parasite</b> <b>density,</b> age and body temperature on one hand and rainfall plus <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> on the other hand. Results: A direct relationship was observed between malaria transmission and monthly rainfall in Entebbe Municipality. About 69. 8 % of the patients had fever. <b>Parasite</b> <b>density</b> fluctuated according to monthly rainfall pattern. Two peaks of high <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> was observed, each peak coinciding with a peak rainfall pattern of the bimodal annual rain seasons. There was a negative but significant correlation (r =- 0. 09271; p < 0. 0214) between <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> and age, suggesting that mature individuals clear parasites more effectively than children. Furthermore, we observed a bimodal peak of mean <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> in children and adults; peak in children is higher than of adults, each peak coinciding with rainfall pattern.

40|$|Abstract Objective The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the performance of nested PCR with expert microscopy as a means of detecting Plasmodium parasites during active malaria surveillance in western Thailand. Methods The study was performed from May 2000 to April 2002 in the village of Kong Mong Tha, located in western Thailand. Plasmodium vivax (PV) and Plasmodium falciparum (PF) are the predominant parasite species in this village, followed by Plasmodium malariae (PM) and Plasmodium ovale (PO). Each month, fingerprick blood samples were taken from each participating individual and used to prepare thick and thin blood films and for PCR analysis. Results PCR was sensitive (96 %) and specific (98 %) for malaria at <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> ≥ 500 /μl; however, only 18 % (47 / 269) of P. falciparum - and 5 % (20 / 390) of P. vivax -positive films had <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> this high. Performance of PCR decreased markedly at <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> P. falciparum and 24 % for P. vivax at densities Conclusion Although PCR performance appeared poor when compared to microscopy, data indicated that the discrepancy between the two methods resulted from poor performance of microscopy at low <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> rather than poor performance of PCR. These data are not unusual when the diagnostic method being evaluated is more sensitive than the reference method. PCR appears to be a useful method for detecting Plasmodium parasites during active malaria surveillance in Thailand. </p...|$|R

This device performed well in field settings but {{was limited to the}} detection of a single malaria species, Plasmodium falciparum. The ParaSight F+V assay advanced upon the ParaSight F test format by incorporating a monoclonal antibody directed against a proprietary Plasmodium vivax-specific antigen, in addition to the antibody directed against P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2, which was used in the ParaSight F assay. The modified assay was developed to add the capability to detect P. falciparum and P. vivax in a single-test-strip format. The present study evaluated three distinct ParaSight F+V prototypes with samples from symptomatic patients in regions of Thailand and Peru where malaria is endemic. Over a 2 -year enrollment period (1998 and 1999), a total of 4, 894 patients consented to participation in the study. Compared with the results for duplicate microscopic examinations of Giemsa-stained blood smears as the reference diagnostic standard, each successive prototype showed substantial improvement in performance. The final ParaSight F+V prototype, evaluated in 1999, had an overall sensitivity for detection of asexual P. falciparum parasites of 98 %. The sensitivity of the device was 100 % for P. falciparum densities of > 500 parasites/μl, with a sensitivity of 83 % for <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> of ≤ 500 /μl.

A total of one hundred and thirty-six (136) male patients were recruited. QBC haematological analysis, QBC malaria parasite specie identification and quantification and thin blood film for differential leucocytes count was used. The mean values of the haematological parameters in each quartile of parasite densities were determined using Microsoft Excel statistical package. Regression analysis was employed to model the experiential relationship between <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> and haematological parameters. All regression relationships were tested and {{the relationship with the}} highest coefficient of determination (R 2) was accepted as the valid relationship. The relationships tested included linear, polynomial, exponential, logarithmic and power relationships. The X- axis of the regression graphs stand for the <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> while Y-axis stands for the respective haematological parameters  Neutrophil count had a negative  exponential relationship with the <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> and is related to the <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> by a polynomial equation model: y nm = - 7 E- 07 x 2 - 0. 0003 x + 56. 685. The coefficient of determination (R 2) was 0. 6140. This means that the rate of change of the parasitemia will depend on the initial value of the neutrophil. As the neutrophil increases, the parasitemia will tend to decrease in a double, triple and quadruple manner. The relationship between lymphocyte count, monocyte count and eosinophil count and <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> was logarithmic and expressed by the following linear equation models: y lm = - 2. 371 ln(x) + 37. 296, y mm = 0. 6965 ln(x) + 5. 7692 and y em = 0. 9334 ln(x) + 4. 1718 in the same order. Their respective high coefficients of determination (R 2) were 0. 8027, 0. 8867 and 0. 9553. This logarithmic relationship means that each doubling of monocyte count and eosinophil count will cause the same amount of increase in parasitemia whereas each doubling of lymphocyte count will cause the same amount of decrease in parasitemia. The best fitting regression model for total white cell count (WBC), haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume (PCV) (haematocrit) and mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> was a linear model and expressed by the following linear equation models: y WBCm = 1. 2314 x + 8533. 8, y Hbm = - 0. 0014 x + 13. 004, y PCVm = - 0. 0046 x + 41. 443 and y MCHCm = - 0. 0008 x + 32. 336. Their respective coefficients of determination are 0. 7397, 0. 6248, 0. 9758 and 0. 8584.   This linear relationship means that as the <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> is increasing that there is a corresponding decrease in haemoglobin concentration, PCV and MCHC and a corresponding increase in total white cell count.   The best fitting regression model between platelet count and <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> is a power model with a very high coefficient of determination (R 2 = 0. 9938) and expressed by: y Pltm = 278047 x - 0. 122.

Data for 1, 711 residents of an eastern Ugandan community were used in pedigree-based variance component analysis. Heritability of <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> was 13 % (P < 0. 001) but was not significant after controlling for shared household. Allowing variance components to vary between children (< 16 years) and adults (≥ 16 years) revealed striking age differences; 26 % of variation {{could be explained by}} additively acting genes in children (P < 0. 001), but there was no genetic involvement in adults.

40|$|Introduction. The {{estimation}} of malaria <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> using a microscope heavily relies on White Blood Cells (WBCs) counts. An assumed WBCs count of 8000 /µL {{has been accepted}} as reasonably accurate in estimating malaria parasite densities due to the challenge to accurately determine WBCs count. Method. The study used 4944 pieces of laboratory data of consented participants of age group less than 5 years. The study compared parasite densities of absolute WBCs, assumed WBCs, and the WBCs reference values in Central Ghana. Ethical approvals were given by three ethics committees. Results. The mean (±SD) WBCs and geometric mean <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> (GMPD) were 10500 /µL (± 4. 1) and 10644 /µL (95 % CI 9986 /µL to 11346 /µL), respectively. The difference in the GMPD compared using absolute WBCs and densities of assumed WBCs was significantly lower. The difference in GMPD obtained with an assumed WBCs count {{and that of the}} WBCs reference values for the study area, 10400 /µL and 9200 /µL for children in different age groups, were not significant. Discussion. Significant errors could result when assumed WBCs count is used to estimate malaria <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> in children. GMPD generated with WBCs reference values statistically agreed with density from the absolute WBCs. When obtaining absolute WBC is not possible, the reference value can be used to estimate <b>parasite</b> <b>density...</b>|$|E
40|$|Although {{several studies}} have {{supported}} that sickle cell trait (HbAS) protects against falciparum malaria, the exact mechanism by which sickle gene confers protection is unclear. Further, there is no information {{on the influence of}} sickle gene on parasitic diversity of P. falciparum population in severe symptomatic malaria.  This study was undertaken to assess the effect of the sickle gene on the <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> and diversities in hospitalized adult patients with severe falciparum malaria. The study was carried out in 166 adult hospitalized subjects with severe falciparum malaria at Sickle Cell Clinic and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Burla, Odisha, India. They were divided into three groups on the basis of hemoglobin variants HbAA (n= 104), HbAS (n= 30) and HbSS (n= 32). The msp- 1 loci was genotyped using a PCR based methodology. The <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> were significantly high in HbAA compared to HbAS and HbSS. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) and multiclonicity for msp- 1 were significantly low in HbSS and HbAS compared to HbAA. The prevalence of K 1 (p< 0. 0001) and MAD 20 (p= 0. 0003) alleles were significantly high in HbAA. The RO 33 allele was detected at a higher frequency in HbSS and HbAS, compared to K 1 and MAD 20.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{areas where}} malaria {{endemicity}} is high, many people harbour blood stage parasites without acute febrile illness, complicating {{the estimation of}} disease burden from infection data. For Plasmodium falciparum the density of parasitaemia that can be tolerated is low in the youngest children, but reaches a maximum in the age groups at highest risk of infection. There is little data on the age dependence of tolerance in other species of human malaria. Methods Parasite densities measured in 24, 386 presumptive malaria cases at two local health centres in the Wosera area of Papua New Guinea were compared with the distributions of parasite densities recorded in community surveys in the same area. We then analyse the proportions of cases attributable to each of Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae as functions of <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> and age using a latent class model. These attributable fractions are then used to compute the incidence of attributable disease. Results Overall 33. 3 %, 6. 1 %, and 0. 1 % of the presumptive cases were attributable to P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae respectively. The incidence of attributable disease and <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> broadly follow similar age patterns. The logarithm of the incidence of acute illness is approximately proportion to the logarithm of the <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> for all three malaria species, with little age variation in the relationship for P. vivax or P. malariae. P. falciparum shows more age variation in disease incidence at given levels of parasitaemia than the other species. Conclusion The similarities between Plasmodium species in the relationships between <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> and risk of attributable disease are compatible with the hypothesis that pan-specific mechanisms may regulate tolerance to different human Plasmodia. A straightforward mathematical expression {{might be used to}} project disease burden from <b>parasite</b> <b>density</b> distributions assessed in community-based parasitological surveys. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fifty {{children}} from 9 families {{were enrolled in}} a longitudinal study of 8 months to evaluate individual levels of Plasmodium falciparum density in blood during asymptomatic infections. Individual <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> were adjusted for age and date of blood intake. The arithmetic means of these adjusted <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> (MAPD) were not influenced by sickle cell trait nor by G 6 PD enzyme activity. On the contrary, family analysis revealed the presence of similar MAPD values according to the sibships. Moreover, sibships frequently infected with P. malariae exhibited the highest P. falciparum MAPDs. The difference in aggressiveness of malaria vectors between {{the northern and southern}} halves of the village did not explain the distribution of MAPD, nor did it explain the differences in mean frequency of P. malariae infection among the sibships. We conclude that the familial characteristic of susceptibility to both P. falciparum and P. malariae infections is more likely influenced by the host’s genetic background than by differences in the levels of malaria transmission...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: For {{clinical}} and epidemiological reasons, {{it is interesting}} to diagnose non-falciparum malaria to the species level. This retrospective study assessed the performance of the SD BIOLINE Malaria Antigen Pv test (FK 70), a two-band immunochromatographic test detecting Plasmodium vivax-specific lactate dehydrogenase, on samples of international travellers in a non-endemic setting. METHODS: Stored blood samples from international travellers suspected of malaria were used, with microscopy corrected by PCR as the reference method. Samples infected by Plasmodium vivax (n = 100), Plasmodium falciparum (n = 75), Plasmodium ovale (n = 75) and Plasmodium malariae (n = 25) were included, as well as 100 malaria-negative samples. End points were sensitivity, specificity, inter-reader reliability and reproducibility. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of the FK 70 for the diagnosis of P. vivax was 88. 0 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 83. 6 % - 90. 3 %). For <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> > 500 /microl, a sensitivity of 97. 2 % (CI: 92. 6 % - 99. 1 %) was obtained. Specificity was 98. 5 %, with 4 out of 75 P. falciparum samples testing positive. None of the P. ovale samples tested positive. Nearly two-thirds (57 / 88, 64. 7 %) of positive P. vivax samples showed faint or weak line intensities, with stronger line intensities at higher <b>parasite</b> <b>densities.</b> The test showed excellent reproducibility and reliability for test results and line intensities (kappa values exceeding 0. 98 and 0. 87 respectively).

It can be of added value to microscopy in species differentiation of malaria infections, especially at <b>parasite</b> <b>densities</b> > 500 /microl...|$|R
