[...] "Turned proletarian", he and Rose-Henriette lived in rented rooms at Pasajul Roman. Maiorescu only allowed Florescu to teach an optional [...] "free" [...] course at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters. The lessons were a corpus of [...] "critical modern history" [...] (published as a textbook in 1875), discussing such topics as progressivism, the Ancien Régime, British constitutionalism, and German nationalism, {{as well as the}} genesis of Wallachian boyardom. They were also indirectly supervised from Paris by professor Henri <b>Pigeonneau,</b> who sent Florescu a bibliography. Although Florescu expressed his frustration over lacking oratorical skills, the lectures made him very popular with Bucharesters.|$|E

60|$|The next morning, {{on coming}} into the garden, I found that Mrs. Church and her {{daughter}} had departed. I was informed of this fact by old M. <b>Pigeonneau,</b> who sat there under a tree, having his coffee at a little green table.|$|E
6000|$|She {{smiled at}} me—she was {{standing}} in the light that came from the house. M. <b>Pigeonneau</b> meanwhile, who had awaited his chance, advanced to Miss Ruck with his glass of syrup. “I’ve kept it for you, mademoiselle,” he said; “I’ve jealously guarded it. It’s very delicious!” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Allons, en marche!" [...] cried M. <b>Pigeonneau,</b> smiling still, and undiscouraged by her inhumanity. [...] "Let as make {{together}} {{the tour of}} the garden." [...] And he imposed his society upon Miss Ruck with a respectful, elderly grace which was evidently unable to see anything in her reluctance but modesty, and was sublimely conscious of a mission to place modesty at its ease. This ill-assorted couple walked in front, while Aurora Church and I strolled along together.|$|E
6000|$|... “Allons, en marche!” trumpeted M. <b>Pigeonneau,</b> all gallant urbanity and undiscouraged by her impertinence. “Let us make {{together}} {{the tour of}} the garden.” And he attached himself to Miss Ruck with a respectful elderly grace which treated her own lack even of the juvenile form of that attraction as some flower of alien modesty, and was ever sublimely conscious of a mission to place modesty at its ease. This ill-assorted couple walked in front, while Aurora Church and I strolled along together.|$|E
6000|$|... “Will {{you allow}} me to {{introduce}} you to my daughter?” he said, moved apparently by a paternal inclination to provide this young lady with social diversion. She was standing with her mother in one of the paths, where she looked about with no great complacency, I inferred, at the homely characteristics of the place. Old M. <b>Pigeonneau</b> meanwhile hovered near, hesitating apparently between the desire to be urbane and the absence of a pretext. “Mrs. Ruck, Miss Sophy Ruck”—my friend led me up.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Ruck {{made the}} {{acquaintance}} of Mrs. Church that {{evening in the}} parlour, being presented to her by his wife, who presumed on the rights conferred upon herself by the mutual proximity, at table, of the two ladies. I suspected that in Mrs. Church's view Mrs. Ruck presumed too far. The fugitive from the Pension Chamousset, as M. <b>Pigeonneau</b> called her, was a little fresh, plump, comely woman, looking less than her age, with a round, bright, serious face. She was very simply and frugally dressed, not {{at all in the}} manner of Mr. Ruck's companions, and she had an air of quiet distinction which was an excellent defensive weapon. She exhibited a polite disposition to listen to what Mr. Ruck might have to say, but her manner was equivalent to an intimation that what she valued least in boarding- house life was its social opportunities. She had placed herself near a lamp, after carefully screwing it and turning it up, and she had opened in her lap, with the assistance of a large embroidered marker, an octavo volume, which I perceived to be in German. To Mrs. Ruck and her daughter she was evidently a puzzle, with her economical attire and her expensive culture. The two younger ladies, however, had begun to fraternise very freely, and Miss Ruck presently went wandering out of the room with her arm round the waist of Miss Church. It was a very warm evening; the long windows of the salon stood wide open into the garden, and, inspired by the balmy darkness, M. <b>Pigeonneau</b> and Mademoiselle Beaurepas, a most obliging little woman, who lisped and always wore a huge cravat, declared they would organise a fete de nuit. They engaged in this undertaking, and the fete developed itself, consisting of half-a-dozen red paper lanterns, hung about on the trees, and of several glasses of sirop, carried on a tray by the stout-armed Celestine. As the festival deepened to its climax I went out into the garden, where M. <b>Pigeonneau</b> was master of ceremonies.|$|E

60|$|There {{was a kind}} of {{pavilion}} or kiosk, {{which served}} as a cafe, and at which the delicacies procurable at such an establishment were dispensed. Miss Ruck pointed to the little green tables and chairs which were set out on the gravel; M. <b>Pigeonneau,</b> fluttering with a sense of dissipation, seconded the proposal, and we presently sat down and gave our order to a nimble attendant. I managed again to place myself next to Aurora Church; our companions were {{on the other side of}} the table.|$|E

60|$|I had {{determined}} {{in accordance with}} my brother’s telegram to go away in the afternoon; so that, having various duties to perform, I left M. <b>Pigeonneau</b> to his ethnic studies. Among other things I went {{in the course of}} the morning to the banker’s, to draw money for my journey, and there I found Mr. Ruck with a pile of crumpled letters in his lap, his chair tipped back and his eyes gloomily fixed on the fringe of the green plush table-cloth. I timidly expressed the hope that he had got better news from home; whereupon he gave me a look in which, considering his provocation, the habit of forlorn patience was conspicuous.|$|E

M. <b>Pigeonneau</b> meanwhile had redoubled his transports—he had recognised Miss Ruck. “Oh la belle rencontre, nos aimables convives—the prettiest girl in the world in effect!” And then after we had greeted and joined the young ladies, who, like ourselves, were walking arm in arm and enjoying the scene, he addressed himself to the special object of his admiration, Mees Roque. “I was citing you with enthusiasm to my young friend here even before I had recognised you, mademoiselle.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found my}} Galignani {{and went off}} with it into the garden, where I seated myself {{on a bench in}} the shade. Presently I saw the tall gentleman in the hat appear at one of the open windows of the salon and stand there with {{his hands in his pockets}} and his legs a little apart. He looked {{infinitely}} bored, and—I don’t know why—I immediately felt sorry for him. He hadn’t at all—as M. <b>Pigeonneau,</b> for instance, in his way, had it—the romantic note; he looked just a jaded, faded, absolutely voided man of business. But after a little he came into the garden and began to stroll about; and then his restless helpless carriage and the vague unacquainted manner in which his eyes wandered over the place seemed to make it proper that, as an older resident, I should offer him a certain hospitality. I addressed him some remark founded on our passage of a moment before, and he came and sat down beside me on my bench, clasping one of his long knees in his hands.|$|E
6000|$|Before I {{had time}} to suggest an {{hypothesis}} as regards this latter point I saw something that made me rise—I fear with an undissimulated start—from my chair. This was {{nothing less than the}} neat little figure of Mrs. Church—a perfect model of the femme comme il faut—approaching our table with an impatient step and followed most unexpectedly in her advance by the pre-eminent form of Mr. Ruck, whose high hat had never looked so high. She had evidently come in search of her daughter, and if she had commanded this gentleman’s attendance it had been on no more intimate ground than that of his unenvied paternity to her guilty child’s accomplice. My movement had given the alarm and my young friend and M. <b>Pigeonneau</b> got up; Miss Ruck alone didn’t, in the local phrase, derange herself. Mrs. Church, beneath her modest little bonnet, looked thoroughly resolute though not at all agitated; she came straight to her daughter, who received her with a smile, and then she took the rest of us in very fixedly and tranquilly and without bowing. I must do both these ladies the justice that neither of them made the least little “scene.” ...|$|E

60|$|As {{commonly}} {{happens in}} boarding-houses {{the rustle of}} petticoats was at the Pension Beaurepas the most familiar form of the human tread. We enjoyed the usual allowance of economical widows and old maids and, to maintain {{the balance of the}} sexes, could boast but of a finished old Frenchman and an obscure young American. It hardly made the matter easier that the old Frenchman came from Lausanne. He was a native of that well-perched place, but had once spent six months in Paris, where he had tasted of the tree of knowledge; he had got beyond Lausanne, whose resources he pronounced inadequate. Lausanne, as he said, “manquait d’agrêments.” When obliged, for reasons he never specified, to bring his residence in Paris to a close, he had fallen back on Geneva; he had broken his fall at the Pension Beaurepas. Geneva was after all more like Paris, and at a Genevese boarding-house there was sure to be plenty of Americans who might be more or less counted on to add to the resemblance. M. <b>Pigeonneau</b> was a little lean man with a vast narrow nose, who sat a great deal in the garden and bent his eyes, {{with the aid of a}} large magnifying glass, on a volume from the cabinet de lecture.|$|E

60|$|Old M. <b>Pigeonneau</b> {{had more}} than once offered me the {{privilege}} of a walk in his company, but his invitation had hitherto, {{for one reason or}} another, always found me hampered. It befell, however, one afternoon that I saw him go forth for a vague airing with an unattended patience that attracted my sympathy. I hastily overtook him and passed my hand into his venerable arm, an overture that produced in the good old man so rejoicing a response that he at once proposed we should direct our steps to the English Garden: no scene less consecrated to social ease was worthy of our union. To the English Garden accordingly we went; it lay beyond the bridge and beside the lake. It was always pretty and now was really recreative; a band played furiously in the centre and a number of discreet listeners sat under the small trees on benches and little chairs or strolled beside the blue water. We joined the strollers, we observed our companions and conversed on obvious topics. Some of these last, of course, were the pretty women who graced the prospect and who, in the light of M. Pigeonneau’s comprehensive criticism, appeared surprisingly numerous. He seemed bent upon our making up our minds as to which might be prettiest, and this was an innocent game in which I consented to take a hand.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Ruck {{distinguished}} me, as the French say. He honoured me {{with his}} esteem, and, as the days elapsed, with {{a large portion of}} his confidence. Sometimes he bored me a little, for the tone of his conversation was not cheerful, tending as it did almost exclusively to a melancholy dirge over the financial prostration of our common country. [...] "No, sir, business in the United States is not what it once was," [...] he found occasion to remark several times a day. [...] "There's not the same spring--there's not the same hopeful feeling. You can see it in all departments." [...] He used to sit by the hour in the little garden of the pension, with a roll of American newspapers in his lap and his high hat pushed back, swinging one of his long legs and reading the New York Herald. He paid a daily visit to the American banker's, {{on the other side of}} the Rhone, and remained there a long time, turning over the old papers on the green velvet table in the middle of the Salon des Etrangers, and fraternising with chance compatriots. But in spite of these diversions his time hung heavily upon his hands. I used sometimes to propose to him to take a walk; but he had a mortal horror of pedestrianism, and regarded my own taste for it as' a morbid form of activity. [...] "You'll kill yourself, if you don't look out," [...] he said, [...] "walking all over the country. I don't want to walk round that way; I ain't a postman!" [...] Briefly speaking, Mr. Ruck had few resources. His wife and daughter, on the other hand, it was to be supposed, were possessed of a good many that could not be apparent to an unobtrusive young man. They also sat a great deal in the garden or in the salon, side by side, with folded hands, contemplating material objects, and were remarkably independent of most of the usual feminine aids to idleness--light literature, tapestry, the use of the piano. They were, however, much fonder of locomotion than their companion, and I often met them in the Rue du Rhone and on the quays, loitering in front of the jewellers' windows. They might have had a cavalier in the person of old M. <b>Pigeonneau,</b> who possessed a high appreciation of their charms, but who, owing to the absence of a common idiom, was deprived of the pleasures of intimacy. He knew no English, and Mrs. Ruck and her daughter had, as it seemed, an incurable mistrust of the beautiful tongue which, as the old man endeavoured to impress upon them, was pre-eminently the language of conversation.|$|E
