50|$|Mullin gave two public <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> his machines, {{and they}} caused a {{sensation}} among American audio professionals; many listeners literally {{could not believe}} that what they heard was not a live performance. By luck, Mullin's second demonstration was held at MGM studios in Hollywood and in the audience that day was Bing Crosby's technical director, Murdo Mackenzie. He arranged for Mullin to meet Crosby and in June 1947 he gave Crosby a <b>private</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> his magnetic tape recorders.|$|R
500|$|Animal welfare {{groups have}} called animal deaths [...] "depressingly predictable" [...] and seek {{a boycott of}} the rodeo. In the United Kingdom travel {{agencies}} {{have been asked to}} stop offering tourism packages to the Stampede, and in 2010, 92 members of the UK Parliament signed an Early Day Motion asking their Canadian counterparts to ban rodeo. Several groups petitioned the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to cancel their planned attendance in 2011. [...] However, the couple attended and participated in a <b>private</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> rodeo and chuckwagon events.|$|R
5000|$|On March 28, 1889 Keely's counsel {{announced}} that the inventor had the [...] "missing link" [...] which was {{needed to make the}} [...] "vibratory resonator and ethereal generative evaporator" [...] a success. It was described as a copper tube {{in the form of a}} loop, with the ends welded together so that no joint could be seen, and had been made in copper due to that metal's [...] "resonant properties". A <b>private</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> Keely's motor was promised as soon as the tube was [...] "adjusted", and was stated as likely to occur [...] "in a week or two".|$|R

Concluding that Eastern Front was [...] "also a virtuoso <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>awesome</b> built-in capabilities <b>of</b> the Atari computer. This game literally could not be done on any other computer in as satisfactory an execution", the magazine named it Game of the Year in 1981.|$|R
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War in 1950, the USAF found itself in dire need of an all-weather interdiction aircraft. The existing inventory of piston-engined Douglas B-26 Invaders had been dispatched in this capacity at the very start of the conflict; however, within only a few months within the theatre, the B-26 had suffered a very high rate of attrition and successes with the type were typically limited. In response to these needs, the USAF requested the British government to provide a <b>private</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> the English Electric Canberra, a newly developed jet-powered bomber. On 17 August 1950, the Canberra demonstration was performed at RAF Burtonwood, Warrington, Cheshire, England; during the following month, a team of US test pilots and engineers visited English Electric's Warton factory to perform a series of flight tests and a detailed technical assessment of the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The Dean {{drive was}} a device created and {{promoted}} by inventor Norman Lomer Dean (1902-1972) that {{he claimed to}} be a reactionless drive. Dean claimed that his device was able to generate a uni-directional force in free space, in violation of Newton's third law of motion from classical physics. His claims generated notoriety because, if true, such a device would have had enormous applications, completely changing human transport, engineering, space travel and more. Dean made several controlled <b>private</b> <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> a number of different devices, however no working models were ever demonstrated publicly or subjected to independent analysis and Dean never presented any rigorous theoretical basis for their operation. Analysts conclude that the motion seen in Dean's device demonstrations was likely reliant on unsymmetrical frictional resistance between the device and the surface on which the device was set, resulting in the device moving in one direction when in operation, driven by the vibrations of the apparatus.|$|R
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 28 December 1895, Méliès {{attended}} a special <b>private</b> <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> the Lumière brothers' cinematograph, given for owners of Parisian houses of spectacle. Méliès immediately offered the Lumières 10,000 for one of their machines; the Lumières refused, anxious to keep a close control on their invention and to emphasize the scientific nature of the device. (For the same reasons, they refused the Musée Grévin's 20,000 bid and the Folies Bergère's 50,000 bid the same night.) Méliès, intent on finding a film projector for the Théâtre Robert-Houdin, turned elsewhere; numerous other inventors in Europe and America were experimenting with machines similar to the Lumières' invention, albeit at a less technically sophisticated level. Possibly acting on a tip from Jehanne d'Alcy, who may have seen Robert W. Paul's Animatograph film projector while on tour in England, Méliès traveled to London. He bought an Animatograph from Paul, {{as well as several}} short films sold by Paul and by the Edison Manufacturing Company. By April 1896, the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was showing films as part of its daily performances.|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} musicals were {{originally}} performed as amateur or semi-professional productions. Although <b>private</b> <b>demonstration</b> recordings <b>of</b> the scores {{are known to}} exist, few of the shows had commercial cast albums released. A song from A Bunch of Ratbags was released as a single, cover versions of two songs from The Computer and Love's Travelling Salesman were included on a 1970 compilation LP entitled Australian Musicals Now, and a studio recording of selections from Red, White and Boogie and Sweet Fanny Adams was released in 1983 on Don Battye's Trigpoint label. The only stage production to generate a complete original cast recording was Caroline; the original LP was released in 1971 and subsequently re-issued on CD (by London-based label Dress Circle Records) in 1998.|$|R
40|$|In August 2006, NASA awarded Space Act Agreements (SAAs) for Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) {{under the}} Commercial Crew and Cargo Project Office at Johnson Space Center. One {{of the goals}} of the SAAs is to {{facilitate}} U. S. <b>private</b> industry <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> cargo transportation capabilities, ultimately achieving reliable, cost effective access to low-Earth orbit (LEO). Each COTS provider is required to complete International Space Stations (ISS) Integration activities, which includes meeting the physical and functional interfaces and interface requirements between the ISS and COTS vehicles. These requirements focus on the areas of risk to the ISS during rendezvous and proximity operations, as well as the integration operations while the COTS vehicle is berthed to the ISS. On December 23, 2008, NASA awarded Commercial Resupply Service (CRS) contracts to provide resupply services to the ISS, following the Shuttle retirement. In addition to performing any ISS Integration activities, NASA will be performing independent assessments of the launch vehicle and orbital vehicle to evaluate the readiness of the contractor to deliver NASA cargo safely to the ISS. This paper will address the activities NASA Centers, both JSC and KSC, in the oversight and insight function over commercial visiting vehicles to the ISS...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{theological}} aesthetics of Jonathan Edwards. Previous studies of Edwards’ aesthetics tend to pass over doctrinal issues and address Edwards mostly within a philosophical context. In this treatment, the aesthetics of Edwards is examined within an explicitly theological framework. The definitions of beauty offered by several Enlightenment philosophers known to Edwards (Shaftesbury, Addison, Hutcheson) are explored. Edwards creatively integrates from these writers the Neoplatonic tradition (the objective side) and empirical tradition (the subjective side) in his conception of beauty. Edwards uses the concepts of sensibility and beauty to construct his theocentric worldview. In Edwards’ conception, the material world exists for the purpose of serving as a giant metaphor for spiritual reality. Edwards adopts Lockean vocabulary to distinguish between a rational understanding and a sensible perception of spiritual reality. This sensible perception in the saints is the work of the Spirit according to his own nature. The Holy Spirit is God’s own perception of his beauty. Thus the perception of divine beauty by the saints is an extension of the inter-Trinitarian life of God. For Edwards, humility is the beauty of the human nature of Christ. This is a creaturely beauty not available to the pre-incarnate Son. Conversely, immensity is the unique and incommunicable glory of God. Both the Trinitarian beauty and <b>awesome</b> beauty <b>of</b> the immensity of God will reach their climax in the eschatological states of heaven and hell. Hell is especially a <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>awesome</b> glory <b>of</b> God’s immensity. Edwards’ aesthetics brings out the tension between the relatedness and the freedom of God. Both belong to the beauty of God, yet they cannot be harmonized in a closed system. Soon after Edwards’ death, the Reformed tradition in America quickly forgot this insight into the sensual perception of God in its quest of systemic consistency.

5000|$|The {{objectives}} of the Commercial Crew & Cargo Program are to implement U.S. Space Exploration policy with investments to stimulate the commercial space industry; facilitate U.S. <b>private</b> industry <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> cargo and crew space transportation capabilities {{with the goal of}} achieving safe, reliable, cost effective access to low-Earth orbit; and create a market environment in which commercial space transportation services are available to Government and private sector customers.The Commercial Crew & Cargo Program is applying Recovery Act funds to stimulate efforts within the private sector to develop and demonstrate human spaceflight capabilities. NASA plans to use funds appropriated for [...] "Exploration" [...] under the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) through its C3PO to support efforts within the private sector to develop system concepts and capabilities that could ultimately lead to the availability of commercial human spaceflight services. These efforts are intended to foster entrepreneurial activity leading to job growth in engineering, analysis, design, and research and to promote economic recovery as capabilities for new markets are created.ARRA provided $400 million for space exploration related activities. Of this amount, $50 million is to be used for the development of commercial crew space transportation concepts and enabling capabilities. This effort is known as CCDev. The purpose of this activity is to provide funding to assist viable commercial entities in the development of system concepts, key technologies, and capabilities that could ultimately be used in commercial crew human space transportation systems. This development work must show, within the timeframe of the agreement, significant progress on long lead capabilities, technologies and commercial crew risk mitigation tasks in order to accelerate the development of their commercial crew space transportation concept.|$|R
