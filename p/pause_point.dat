40|$|ABSTRACT Under {{constant}} applied force, {{the separation}} of double-stranded DNA into two single strands is known to proceed {{through a series of}} pauses and jumps. Given experimental traces of constant-force unzipping, we present a method whereby the locations of pause points can be extracted {{in the form of a}} <b>pause</b> <b>point</b> spectrum. A simple theoretical model of DNA constant-force unzipping is presented, which generates theoretical <b>pause</b> <b>point</b> spectra through Monte Carlo simulation of the unzipping process. The locations of peaks in the experimental and theoretical <b>pause</b> <b>point</b> spectra are found to be nearly coincident below 6000 basepairs for unzipping the bacteriophage l-genome. The model only requires the sequence, temperature, and a set of empirical basepair binding and stacking energy parameters, and the good agreement with experiment suggests that <b>pause</b> <b>point</b> locations are primarily determined by the DNA sequence. The model is also used to predict <b>pause</b> <b>point</b> spectra for the bacteriophage fX 174 genome. The algorithm for extracting the <b>pause</b> <b>point</b> spectrum might also be useful for studying related systems which exhibit pausing behavior such as molecular motors...|$|E

40|$|Activation of the {{tyrosine}} kinase of a temperature-sensitive mutant v-Src oncoprotein in quiescent Rat-i cells leads to {{passage through the}} cell cycle. Temperature shift experiments show that v-Src is needed to leave G 0, to pass a relatively stable G 1 “pause ” point, and to pass a later G 1 point committing cells to S phase. Classic immediate early responses that activate both AP- 1 DNA binding and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase are induced at G 0 exit, but unexpectedly they rise again in mid-G 1 and {{before the onset of}} S phase, fluctuations that parallel the need for v-Src. An estrogen-inducible mutant c-Raf-i renders these cells susceptible to mitogenic stimulation by 3 -estradiol, without v-Src activity, but greatly inhibits the ability of v-Src to induce DNA synthesis and MAP kinase, probably because v-Src physically associates with inactive c-Raf- 1 at permissive but not restrictive temperature. This implicates c-Raf- 1 association with enzymically active v-Src and consequent activation of the MAP kinase pathway in v-Src mitogenesis. Furthermore, temperature shift experiments indicate that the mid-G 1 peak of MAP kinase activity is associated with cells reaching the G 1 <b>pause</b> <b>point,</b> while the pre-S phase peak is needed for DNA synthesis. In contrast, cell transformation by v-Src does not require enhanced MAP kinase activity at any stage of the cell cycle...|$|E
40|$|The National Transonic Facility (NTF) at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is a {{national}} resource for aeronautical research and development. The government, military and private industries rely on the capability of this facility for realistic flight data. Reducing the operation costs and keeping the NTF affordable is essential for aeronautics research. The NTF is undertaking {{an effort to reduce}} the time between data points during a pitch polar. This reduction is being driven by the operating costs of a cryogenic facility. If the time per data point can be reduced, a substantial cost savings can be realized from a reduction in liquid nitrogen (LN 2) consumption. It is known that angle-of-attack (AoA) positioning is the longest lead-time item between points. In January 2005 a test was conducted at the NTF to determine the cause of the long lead-time so that an effort could be made to improve efficiency. The AoA signal at the NTF originates from onboard instrumentation then travels through a number of different systems including the signal conditioner, digital voltmeter, and the data system where the AoA angle is calculated. It is then fed into a closed loop control system that sets the model position. Each process along this path adds to the time per data point affecting the efficiency of the data taking process. Due {{to the nature of the}} closed loop feed back AoA control and the signal path, it takes approximately 18 seconds to take one pitch <b>pause</b> <b>point</b> with a typical AoA increment. Options are being investigated to reduce the time delay between points by modifying the signal path. These options include: reduced signal filtering, using analog channels instead of a digital volt meter (DVM), re-routing the signal directly to the AoA control computer and implementing new control algorithms. Each of these has potential to reduce the positioning time and together the savings could be significant. These timesaving efforts are essential but must be weighed against possible loss of data quality. For example, a reduction in filtering can introduce noise into the signal and using analog channels could result in some loss of accuracy. Data quality assessments need to be performed concurrently with timesaving techniques since data quality parameters are essential in maintaining facility integrity. This paper will highlight time saving efforts being undertaken or studied at the NTF. It will outline the instrumentation and computer systems involved in setting of the model pitch attitude then suggest changes to the process and discuss how these system changes would effect the time between data points. It also discusses the issue of data quality and how the potential efficiency changes in the system could affect it. Lastly, it will discuss the possibility of using an open loop control system and give some pros and cons of this method...|$|E

30|$|In this section, {{the related}} {{work has been}} {{extensively}} analysed and a positioning of the proposed strategy has been done. Based on data aggregation, we can divide mobile data gathering schemes into two categories. The first category allows no aggregation, in which the ME traverses the deployment field and uploads the data from each sensor via a single hop [13 – 18]. In this category, the ME visits the vicinity of each sensor node by traversing some selected points which are in the transmission range {{of at least one}} sensor. During the movement or at every <b>pause</b> <b>point,</b> the ME uploads data via a single hop from the respective sensors. In [13], the authors proposed a three-tier architecture consisting of a special kind of mobile agents such as people, animal or vehicle; static sensors; and access point. These special agents move around the deployed field with random mobility and upload the data from static sensors. However, even with the achieved energy saving due to the short communication range, this approach leads to high latency with no guarantee of data delivery. This is due to the uncontrolled mobility and the probability of losing the mobile agent (i.e. animal agent). In [14], the authors proposed the joint design of mobile data gathering and space-division multiple access (SDMA) technique as a combined solution. In this scheme, the mobile agent, known as the Sensor Car (SenCar), is equipped with two antennas that is able to upload data concurrently from two compatible sensors via short-range communication. However, even with reduced data uploading time, this scheme adversely prolongs the tour length, especially when using only one SenCar. This is attributed to the requirement that the SenCar should be within the transmission range of each sensor node. To enjoy the maximum benefits of SDMA, the SenCar must visit some specific locations where more sensors are compatible, which may lead to increased tour length. Thus, the optimal solution was suggested to be a balance between SDMA and a shorted tour length of the SenCar. As opposed to the unconstrained data gathering time in [14], the authors in [15] proposed data collection using multiple mobile nodes. These mobile nodes collect the data from each sensor every t second to avoid data overflow due to the limited storage of the sensors. However, this approach was proven to be costly due to {{the increase in the number}} of mobile nodes (MicaZ price is US$ 99 [32]), even with the presence of a sound planning algorithm for mobile collection. In [16], the authors focus on tour planning algorithms for mobile collectors. These algorithms achieve a short data gathering tour whilst ensuring that all data is uploaded within a single-hop fashion. This is due to dividing the deployment field to sub-regions and assigning a mobile collector to one of the sub-regions. In [17], the authors proposed two algorithms that impose a time constraint on the ME via the scheduling strategy for visiting all nodes. Each node must be visited by the ME and should reach the sink within a stipulated time constraint. Therefore, the goal is to plan the paths for MEs that minimize the total length travelled. In [18], the authors proposed mobile data collection based on clustering and long-range wireless link (i.e. WiMax) between the mobile data collector and the gateway. In this scheme, a centre point was selected as the centre of a group of sensors. The point acts as a stopping point for the mobile data collector. The data is uploaded to the mobile data collector via a single hop and then transmitted to the BS. The mobile data collector transmits the data in its buffer to the gateway if the stop point is within the communication range of the gateway. Thus, some of the data are delivered to the BS even before completely collecting the whole data. In addition, the results generated via this scheme minimize the latency of data gathering in comparison to schemes that deliver the data to the BS at the completion of the tour path.|$|E

Then, dichloromethane is distilled to separate it from the byproducts of the reflux reaction. This procedure can be implemented in 1 day. ### Introduction In many instances in synthetic chemistry {{it may be necessary}} to remove residual water from solvents in order to carry out a synthesis procedure under inert conditions. In this example, water is removed from dichloromethane by refluxing dichloromethane in the presence of calcium hydride at 60 °C.

40|$|Authors: Ren-Qi Wang, Teng-Teng Ong, Ke Huang, Weihua Tang & Siu-Choon Ng ### Abstract We {{described}} a facile and effective protocol wherein radical copolymerization is employed to covalently bond cationic β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) onto silica particles with extended linkage, {{resulting in a}} chiral stationary phase (IMPCSP) {{that can be used}} for the enantioseparation of racemic drugs in both high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Starting from commercially available chemicals, the IMPCSP is prepared in several steps: (i) reaction of β-CD with 1 -(p-toluenesulfonyl) -imidazole to afford mono- 6 A-(p-toluenesulfonyl) - 6 A-deoxy-β-cyclodextrin (B); (ii) nucleophilic addition between B and 1 -vinylimidazole and followed by treatment with anionic-exchange resin to give mono-vinylimidazolium-CD chloride (C); (iii) electrophilic addition between C and phenyl isocyanate to generate 6 A-(3 -vinylimidazolium) - 6 -deoxyperphenylcarbamate-β-CD chloride (D); (iv) reaction of silica gel with 3 -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane to engender vinylized silica (E); (v) immobilization of C onto vinylized silica via radical copolymerization with 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene in the presence of 2, 2 ’-azobis(2 -methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) to afford the desired chiral stationary phases. The overall IMPCSP preparation and column packing protocol requires ~ 2 weeks. ### Introduction Chromatographic methodologies have been extensively explored for accurate sample analyses, online monitoring of reaction progress and purifying of synthesized products (1). Especially, modern chromatographic techniques have been developed as powerful tools for chiral separation and preparation of enantiomers, most of which are of biological and pharmaceutical interests. Whatever chiral chromatographic techniques are used, chiral selectors either dissolved as mobile phases or mobilized onto supporting materials as stationary phases are crucial for successful and robust enantioseparations. Among the chiral selectors used so far, cyclodextrins (CDs) and their derivatives have been widely used in chiral chromatography since its first introduction by Armstrong et al. (2). In order to obtain a better solubility, the charged moieties are favorably introduced onto CD rims for capillary electrophoresis (CE). The self-mobility of CD in the ionized form enhances the separation ability when it is opposite to the electrophoretic mobility of the analytes (3). The hydrophobic moieties on the analytes could be included or adsorbed into the chiral cavity of CDs. Meanwhile, the analytes could also interact with the substituents on the CD rims (4, 5). The native CDs and their chemically-modified derivatives afford fine-tuned hydrophobicities, charges and cone shapes etc., which ultimately result in different tightness and interactions for CD-analytes complexes selectors and thus chemically-manipulated diving forces for chiral recognitions (6 - 14). The charged CD-based chiral mobile phases and chiral stationary phases (CSPs) have been extensively explored in drug chiral analyses (15 - 20). A sulfated β-CD based CSP was developed which enabled great enantioseparations towards 33 racemic drugs in high-perfomace liquid chromatography (HPLC) 9. Recently, ionic-liquids featured positively-charged CDs have been covalently bonded onto silica gels to prepare novel CSPs, which exhibited dual selectivity in HPLC for the enantioseparation of both polar and non-polar compounds (18). The additional electrostatic interactions are significant to achieve separations of polar analytes which may interact with the neutral CDs too weakly, where 16 aromatic alcohol racemates and 2 drugs were achieved in polar organic mobile phases 19. In our previous report, a series of coated CSPs based on fully derivatized cationic β-CD were prepared. These cationic β-CD CSPs have shown strong enantioseparation abilities and moderate retention times towards a series of α-phenyl alcohols in both supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and HPLC 20. However, polar organic solvents in the mobile phase could cause damage to the coated CSPs. Besides, the efficiencies of the coated CSPs are usually low as the surface thickness of chiral selectors is hard to control (21). Figure- 1 (R Wang) Syntheses of Ts-CD (B), compounds C and D. The immobilization of functionalized CD onto silica gel is generally achieved by chemical reactions between highly reactive substituent on CD and the functional groups on silica gel (14, 16 - 18). Tedious synthetic approaches with possible protecting and de-protecting steps are usually required for successful grafting. Comparatively, the facile co-polymerization method is more accessible and reliable, universally employed in producing non-silica fillings for columns applicable for size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) or ion-exchange applications (22). The polymerized materials used for chromatography have wide applicable pH ranges and improved retentions for polar analytes, although lower mechanic strength and efficiency are often observed than the silica-based CSPs. The co-polymerization approach was also explored in the immobilizing of polysaccharide or enantiopure small molecules onto silica gel for the preparation of CSPs (23, 24). Figure- 2 (R Wang) Preparation of IMPCSP via radical copolymerization. In view of the our continuous and successful research endeavors in developing powerful cationic CDs as chiral selectors for both CE and HPLC (12, 25, 26), we recently developed the facile copolymerization methodology in preparing novel covalently-bonded cationic β-CD CSPs via co-polymerization approach (see Figs. 1 and 2). These as-prepared CSPs have successfully expanded the enatioseparation windows towards a broader range of chromatographic conditions for both HPLC and SFC application (27, 28). The linkage between CD selector and silica-support was built by using diene (ca. 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene) as the third monomer for the dual copolymerization system with vinyllated CD and silica gel. The extended linkage can effectively improve the surface loading issue of CD onto silica gel, a challenge faced when direct immobilizing CD derivatives onto silica surface with short spacers due to steric hindrance (29). The as-developed CDs CSPs exhibited great potential in drug enantioseparations in both HPLC and SFC applications. The protocol describes herein the synthesis of imidazolium-based IMPCSP. This methodology can also be applied for the synthesis of other ammonium-based cationic CD CSPs (27, 28), which may find wide applications for both drug enantioseparations and NOM assessments. ### Reagents 1. β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD; > 95 %; TCI, cat. no.

Goggles, gloves and mask should be worn. - Inject phenyl isocyanate 12 ml (110. 32 mmol) into the flask though a plastic syringe. - ! CAUTION Phenyl isocyanate has acute toxicity. It may cause severe skin burns and eye damage. It may cause allergy or asthma symptoms or breathing difficulties if inhaled. Adding 12 ml phenyl isocyanate as a whole would cause large extent of side reaction to produce triphenyl isocyanurate as a by-product. It is strongly recommended to add phenyl isocyanate dropwise with pressure equalizing funnel. Goggles, gloves and mask should be worn before experimental operation in fumehood. - ▲ CRITICAL STEP Phenyl isocyanate should be added with four equal portions. Add 12 ml as a whole would cause large extent of side reaction to produce triphenyl isocyanurate as a by-product. Add phenyl isocyanate drop by drop with pressure equalizing funnel would end up with its transformation in the funnel and the liquid colour changes to light yellow. - Allow the reaction to proceed at 85 °C for 20 h. Set up the vacuum distillation pipeline. - Distill off pyridine under reduced pressure at 85 °C. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Dissolve the residue with chloroform 15 ml. - Add the solution into silica column. Flush the impurities with n-hexane/ethyl acetate (70 : 30 v:v). - ▲ CRITICAL STEP The ratio of n-hexane/ethyl acetate was determined by TLC analyses. The flash column separation progress was also monitored by TLC analyses. Lowering the ratio would result in an increase of the amount of solvents used for eluting the impurities completely. - Flush the product out of the column with MeOH. - Remove the solvent on rotary evaporator to yield D as a dark yellow solid (6. 2 g, 66 % yield). - <b>PAUSE</b> <b>POINT</b> Compound D can be stored in oven at 80 °C for several weeks. - **Synthesis of vinylized silica E** - Dry spherical silica gel particles (5 μm, 5 g) in vacuum (10 mm Hg) at 150 °C for 24 h. Cool down to room temperature. - Fit a 250 -ml double-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar with a rubber septum and a Liebig condenser. Fit the condenser a rubber septum with inlet of dry N 2 and an outlet towards a bubbler containing paraffin oil, in order to prevent the ingress of moisture and air. - Add dry toluene 100 ml into the flask. Switch on the magnetic stirrer and heater. - Inject 3 -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (2. 3 ml) into the flask. - Add dried silica gel from step 22 into the flask. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Allow the reaction to stand at 90 °C for 18 h. Product was collected by filtration through 0. 45 μm pore size membrane and washed with MeOH in Soxhlet apparatus overnight. - Collect the product by filtration through 0. 45 μm pore size membrane and washed with MeOH in Soxhlet extractor overnight. - Dry the product overnight in an oven at 60 °C in vacco to afford the vinylized silica E. - <b>PAUSE</b> <b>POINT</b> Vinylized silica E can be stored at room temperature for several months. - **Co-polymerization for preparation of IMPCSP** - Dissolve compound D (0. 7 g) in chloroform (30 ml). Filter the solution through 0. 45 μm pore size membrane. - Transfer the filtrate and drop onto vinylized silica gel E (1. 4 g) evenly with a glass syringe. - ! CAUTION A glass syringe was preferred to avoid any introduction of siloxal impurities from plastic syringes. Chloroform could corrode the rubber piston of the plastic syringe. - Dry the colloid-like mixture in vacuum (10 mm Hg) at 25 °C. - Fit a 100 -ml double-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar with two rubber septums. - Add the solid from step 32 into the flask. Add AIBN (3 mg) into the flask. - ▲ CRITICAL STEP The amount of AIBN should be controlled. A less amount of AIBN would lead to slow reaction rate but a great amount resulted in rapid radical reactions and short chain growth. In both conditions, successful immobilized CD amounts were low. - Inject anhydrous toluene (20 ml) and 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene (2. 6 ml) into the flask. - ▲ CRITICAL STEP 2, 3 -Dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene should be added before heating started. It was initiated together with the vinyl groups in compound D and vinylized silica E. Therein, 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene could act as a interlink. A delayed addition led to a lower CD amount on IMPCSP, since the radicals formed on D and E could have been annihilated before 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene was added. - Freeze the mixture in liquid N 2 in a Dewar dish and degas the reaction system in vacuum (10 mm Hg) for 0. 5 h. - ! CAUTION Liquid N 2 - Take the flask out of the Dewar dish and thaw at room temperature. - Repeat step 36 and 37 for three times. ? TROUBLESHOOTING - Fit the flask with a Liebig condenser.

Some qualitative estimation methods of terpenoids in plant tissue have been previously described {{but there is no}} protocol of estimating the same quantitatively till date. In the present study a protocol has been attempted to estimate the total terpenoids concentration of different resin producing plants using a monoterpene, Linalool as standard reagent. ### Introduction Terpenes and terpenoids are the primary {{constituents of}} the essential oils of many types of plants and flowers. These compounds belong to the isoprenoid group. Even though isoprene itself has not been found in nature, its polymers, terpenic hydrocarbons and their oxygen derivatives are very often present in large quantities in different plant species. The resin produced by most plants is a viscous liquid, composed mainly of volatile fluid terpene 3. The single isoprene unit, therefore, represents the most basic class of terpenes, the hemiterpenes. An isoprene unit bound to a second isoprene is the defining characteristic of terpene, which is also a monoterpene (C 10). Sesquiterpenes contain three isoprene units (C 15), while diterpenes (C 20) and triterpenes (C 30) contain two and three terpene units respectively. Tetraterpenes consist of four terpene units, polyterpenes more than four such units. In nature, terpenes occur predominantly in the form of hydrocarbons, alcohols and their glycosides, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters. Apart from broad structural diversity, terpenes also exhibit a wide array of biological actions. Essential oils have antimicrobial, antiparasitic, insecticidal and antioxidant/prooxidant activities that often represent the combined bioactivity of multiple components 10. Many plant terpenoids are cytotoxic towards tumour cells and are applied as chemotherapeutic or chemo-preventive compounds 1, 2. Terpenes play an important role as signal compounds and growth regulators (phytohormones) of plants 10. Many insects metabolize the terpenes which they may have obtained from their plant food for synthesizing growth hormones and pheromones 10. Many plant and insect resins like Lac resin also have economically beneficial properties, useful for varnishes and adhesives 4. This protocol describes a rapid, small-scale, high-throughput assay for approximating the total terpenoids content in plant tissue using a monoterpene, Linalool as standard reagent with conc. sulfuric acid. In this reaction Geraniol (primary alcohol, C 10 H 18 O) may be produced from Linalool (Tertiary alcohol, C 10 H 18 O). Alpha-terpineol (C 10 H 18 O) or such monocyclic terpenoids may further be produced from geraniole 3. It is very obscured to explain the exact chemical nature of the reaction in where a brick red precipitation has been formed and which is partially soluble in reaction mixture solution and chloroform but fully in methanol. All estimation has been done spectroscopically at 538 nm. ### Reagents 1. Methanol (Sigma, Cat. No. M 3641) - Sulfuric Acid (Sigma, Cat. No. 320501) - Chloroform (Sigma, Cat. No. C 2432) - Linalool (Sigma, Cat. No. L 2602) ### Equipment 1. Colorimeter - Mixer mill disrupter with adaptor sets for 2 ml tubes (Qiagen tissue lyser) or Mortar & pestle. ### Procedure 1. Harvest plant material (approximately 500 mg.) in screw-capped tubes & freeze immediately in liquid Nitrogen. [Sample must be stored at - 80 ⁰ C for 1 - 2 months but fresh sample must be preferred] - To homogenize the tissue, place three tungsten Carbide beads & 3. 5 ml of ice-cold 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol in each sample tube & insert sample into pre-cooled teflon adaptors. Homogenized tissue for 5 minutes at 30 Hz. If a mixture mill is not available tissue can be homogenized in an ice-cold mortar & pestle. - Remove tungsten carbide beads with a magnet & incubate the sample at room temperature for 48 h in dark. - Centrifuge the samples (4000 g for 15 min. at room temperature) & collect the supernatant in a fresh 2 ml micro-tube. - Add 1. 5 ml Chloroform in each 2 ml microcentrifuge tube & then add 200 µl sample supernatant in each. REMARK For the standard curve 200 µl of previously prepared Linalool solution in methanol will be added to 1. 5 ml Chloroform & serial dilution must be done[dilution level- 100 mg/ 200 µl to 1 mg/ 200 µl (12. 965 µM- 1. 296 µM) Linalool Conc. In case of serial dilution total volume of 200 µl will be make up by addition of 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol]. - Vortex the sample mixture thoroughly & take the time 3 min to rest. - Add 100 µl Conc. Sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) to each 2 ml microcentrifuge tube. - CRITICAL STEP If heat generation occurs then the entire system must be cooled by using ice-pad but not more than 15 min. - Then the assay tube must be incubated at room temperature for 1. 5 h- 2 h in dark. - <b>PAUSE</b> <b>POINT</b> For standard solution (Linalool) incubate not more than 5 minutes and during incubation time the microcentrifuge tube must not be disturbed. - At the end of incubation time a reddish brown precipitation will be formed in each assay microcentrifuge tube. Then carefully & gently decant all supernatant reaction mixture liquid with-out disturbing the precipitation. - CRITICAL STEP The reddish brown precipitation is partially soluble in reaction mixture solution so must gently decant the supernatant fluid. - Add 1. 5 ml of 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol & vortex thoroughly until all the precipitation dissolve in Methanol completely. - Transfer the sample from assay tube to Colorimetric cuvette [95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol will be used as blank] to read the absorbance at 538 nm. Total Terpenoid Calculation 12. Calculate a standard curve from the blank-corrected at wave length at 538 nm of the Linalool standard (Fig. 1). Calculate total terpenoids concentration of unknown plant sample as Linalool equivalents using the regression equation of Linalool standard curve. ### Troubleshooting Terpenoids content varies considerably among leaf and bark tissue and also with environmental and biological stress 8, 11. In the design of this experiment we advise the use of multiple biological and technical replicates, in order to minimize the sample errors (Table 1). Different incubation time should be tried with each plant species and tissue to optimize the assay. Automated liquid handling system may also significantly increase throughput and improve results 6. Most probably sulfuric acid rearranged the linalool and the tertiary alcoholic group reduces to primary alcohol for which the solubility of reaction product has been reduced to chloroform. It is very important to note that sulfuric acid not only reacts to terpenoids but also it may react with methanolic extract of plant tissue samples having plant phenolics and alkaloids. ### Anticipated Results Some qualitative estimation methods of terpenoids in plant tissues have been previously described and widely used 9. The quantitative analytical colorimetric method of total terpenoids concentration in plants as suggested in this protocol can be used to estimate the total terpenoids of different resin producing plants. ### References 1.

This protocol describes how to run 2 -DE gels using narrow pH 3 - 5. 6 immobilised pH gradient strips to separate 2 mg of serum proteins. pH 3 - 6 ampholytes are used to enhance the solubility of proteins in this pH range before the serum proteins are separated in the first dimension by isoelectric point (isoelectric focusing) followed by molecular weight (SDS-PAGE). This approach using the pH 3 - 5. 6 range differs from pH ranges more commonly used for serum or plasma biomarker discovery which span three or more pH units (e. g. pH 3 - 10 and 4 - 7), and has the advantage that the pH range lies outside the range of three highly abundant proteins and therefore improves separation and representation of low abundance features. The protocol described takes approximately 8 days. ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") ### Introduction There is much interest in discovering biomarkers to assess the pathological states of disease, and blood is the most common sample taken from patients to determine disease severity. (1) In hospital laboratories, plasma or serum is obtained from these blood samples and the levels of the biomarkers are determined using automated immunoanalysers or mass spectrometry. However, for many diseases there are no reliable serum/plasma biomarkers available and as a result occasionally invasive approaches such as biopsies are necessary. Not all biomarkers currently used for clinical diagnoses are reliable (e. g. they may show large variation in marker levels between different individuals with the same pathological state). There is an urgent need for reliable and novel biomarkers for many diseases in order to aid both patients and clinicians for diagnosis as well as for monitoring disease and therapeutic regimens. Two-dimensional {{gel electrophoresis}} (2 -DE) separates proteins and is often used to search for novel biomarkers in serum or plasma. This technique separates proteins in the first dimension by isoelectric point (isoelectric focusing) followed by molecular weight (SDS-PAGE). Commonly used pH ranges for isoelectric focusing are pH 3 - 10 and pH 4 - 7 which have been used by us and others to successfully discover novel disease biomarkers. (2, 3) However, plasma and serum contain high abundant proteins in these pH ranges. These high abundant proteins restrict the amount of protein that can be loaded onto 2 -DE gels and therefore decreases the chances of identifying low abundance proteins which potentially could serve as biomarkers. In the protocol described here we use 2 -DE over a narrow pH 3 - 5. 6 range since this lies outside the range of the highly abundant proteins albumin, transferrin and immunoglobulins. The lack of highly abundant proteins in this pH range allows four times more serum or plasma to be loaded compared to a 2 -DE gel using a wide pH 3 - 10 range. Here we present {{for the first time the}} detailed protocol for using pH 3 - 5. 6 immobilised pH gradient strips to separate serum and plasma by 2 -DE gels. (4, 5) Protocol development included analysis of various narrow pH ranges for 2 -DE and their comparison to the more commonly used wide pH range. The use of a narrow pH 3 - 5. 6 range led to an improved separation and visualisation of low abundance proteins. In Gangadharan et al. (4) for example, we demonstrate that using the pH 3 − 5. 6 range with a load of 2 mg 262 additional protein features were detected compared to a pH 3 − 10 gel across the same pH 3 − 5. 6 range. These extra features are potentially new disease biomarkers which are missed when using 2 -DE gels with a wide pH range. This novel approach described here not only helps in identifying new biomarkers in serum/plasma but would also be of great benefit in the separation and analysis of other samples where high abundant proteins like albumin may pose a problem such as cerebrospinal fluid or urine. A work flow diagram to show how the experimental steps fit together and examples of equipment which can be used is shown in Fig. 1. This work flow could also be adapted for use in 2 -D Fluorescence Difference Gel Electrophoresis (2 -D DIGE). ### Reagents 1.

Collect blood from patients using P 100 tubes according to the manufacturer’s recommendation or in other serum/plasma tubes as previously described for proteomics. (6, 7) - <b>PAUSE</b> <b>POINT</b> Serum / plasma samples can be stored at – 80 °C until required. - Determine the total protein concentration of the sample using a protein assay such as BCA protein assay according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. - Mix 2. 4 mg of serum / plasma protein with rehydration sample buffer up to a total volume of 442 μl. - CRITICAL STEP Never heat the samples after adding urea. Elevated temperatures can result in urea hydrolysing to isocyanate. This can cause protein modification by carbamylation leading to artifactual trains of protein features on 2 -DE gels. - ! CAUTION Tributyl phosphine in the rehydration sample buffer is spontaneously inflammable in air. - Add 8 μl of pH 3 - 6 carrier ampholytes (final ampholyte concentration = 1. 8 %) and vortex mix for 2 minutes. Leave the samples at room temperature for 30 minutes to ensure complete denaturation and solubilisation. Spin samples at 16, 000 g for 15 min. - Pipette 375 μl of supernatant (containing 2 mg serum/plasma) into separate lanes of a reswelling tray. Place Immobiline pH 3 - 5. 6 NL IPG DryStrips face down onto the protein-containing samples in each lane of the reswelling tray and overlay with 2 ml of dry strip cover mineral oil. Leave to rehydrate for at least 16 h at room temperature. - CRITICAL STEP To ensure successful rehydration, the gel should be swollen to 1 mm thick and the bromophenol blue dye should be stained across the full length of the strip. - **Isoelectric focusing (IEF) ** - Drain off excess mineral oil and transfer to the sample tray of Multiphor II apparatus with the gel facing upwards. - For each IPG DryStrip, cut two electrode wicks 2 cm in length. Soak electrode wicks with 100 μl HPLC grade water and blot with a cleanwipe to ensure that the wicks are damp but not excessively wet. Place damp wicks on either end of the IPG strips and fix electrode bars onto the wicks at either end of the IPG strips. Pour mineral oil into the Multiphor sample tray until the strips are immersed. Prod wicks gently using tweezers to remove air bubbles and ensure good contact with the IPG gel. - Carry out IEF at 300 V for 2 h, a gradient increase to 3500 V over 3 h and then maintain at 3500 V up to 70 kVh using an EPS 3500 XL power supply. For all stages, set the current limit to 10 mA for 12 gels, and the power limit to 5 W. Maintain the temperature of the Multiphor at 17 °C using a recycling thermostatic water bath. - <b>PAUSE</b> <b>POINT</b> Strips can be snap frozen on dry ice and then stored at – 80 °C until required. - **Two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D-PAGE) ** - Gels can be poured using a gradient gel casting machine such as the DALT Gradient maker connected to a peristaltic pump. Pour gels according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. Precast gels can also be used such as the ExcelGel system (GE Healthcare). Gels can be either of fixed percentage such as 12 % or of a gradient such as 9 - 16 % the latter of which gives better separation for serum / plasma. Gels must be able to accommodate 18 cm IPG strips. - Optional step: If pouring gels, the plates can be treated so that the gel covalently binds to one of the glass plates in the gel cassette. This makes it easier to manipulate the gels for fixing, staining, scanning, storage and cutting. One plate needs to be treated with Bind-Silane and the other with Repel-Silane ES according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. - Immediately post IEF, incubate the IPG strips in 2 ml of reducing equilibration solution for 15 min at room temperature. Drain strips of equilibration solution. Overlay the strips onto the second dimension gels and seal in place with 90 °C, 0. 5 % (w/v) agarose in Laemmli reservoir buffer. Use the flat end of a spatula to aid placement of the IPG strip. - Perform second dimension electrophoresis with Laemmli reservoir buffer using a Hoefer DALT running tank or any other equivalent electrophoresis running tank capable of running large 18 cm by 18 cm gels. Set the current to 20 mA per gel for 1 h, followed by 40 mA per gel for approximately 4 h. Set the power limit to 150 W for a tank containing 6 gels and the voltage limit to 600 V throughout the run. Maintain the temperature at 10 °C using a recycling thermostatic water bath. Terminate electrophoresis once the bromophenol blue tracking dye has reached the bottom of the gel. - Remove gels from the running tank and open the glass plates. Discard the IPG strip and the overlay agarose. Wash gels briefly in ultrapure water to remove running buffer and then place into a staining tank such as the Dodeca stainer (BioRad) or equivalent. Fix the proteins on the gels in 40 % (v/v) ethanol, 10 % (v/v) acetic acid overnight. - Gels can then be stained. For highest sensitivity and greatest compatibility by mass spectrometry, fluorescent stains such as SYPRO Ruby are recommended. 8 Perform staining according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. - Image gels using a scanner/camera appropriate for the stain used. Scanners/cameras are available capable of imaging multiple stains such as the Fuji LAS 1000 Pro CCD camera which can image either fluorescent, silver or Coomassie stained gels. In the case of SYPRO Ruby stained gels, set the parameters to fluorescence and cool the CCD camera to - 25 °C prior to capturing images. Place the gel onto the imaging tray and acquire images over different exposure times (typically between 0. 5 to 2 min) until the optimum image has been produced. - Place scanned gels in a plastic bag with approximately 10 ml of 40 % (v/v) ethanol, 10 % (v/v) acetic acid and seal the bag with a bag sealer. Store at 4 °C until required for excising protein spots. - **Differential image analysis and spot excision** - Perform differential image analysis of the gels. This can be carried out using various commerically available software such as the Medical ELectrophoresis ANalysis Interactive Expert (Melanie) software. Perform differential image analysis according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. An optional step is to calibrate all gels internally for pI and molecular weight using the E. coli proteome as a standard (9), typically using 10 - 15 calibrated landmarks on each gel. Landmarks allow the software to warp the gels so that they can be superimposed onto each other to aid with image analysis. All features displayed as differentially expressed by the software must be validated further by visualising the features across all gels in a montage format. - Differentially expressed features can be excised from the gel manually using a clean scalpel or using any software-driven robot. To aid manual excision gels can be visualised in a dark room using either a white light box (for silver or Coomassie stained gels) or a Dark Reader light box (for fluorescent stained gels). For excision of features using a robotic gel excisor (such as a GCM instrument), the co-ordinates of each differentially expressed protein feature is sent to the robot as a list of commands which will programme x and y movements of the robot arms and direct the cutting head to cut and remove features. To avoid contamination between spots, use a new cutter tip on the cutting head for each gel feature. The robot excises gel features by shearing and aspirating actions. Eject the cutter tips with the isolated gel pieces into separate wells of a 96 well reaction plate with laser made holes on the bottom. - **In-gel trypsin digestion** - In-gel trypsin digestion can then be performed either manually (see Supporting Information) or using an automated workstation such as the DigestPro as described below (all steps at room temperature unless stated otherwise). The DigestPro workstation adds solutions to the 96 well plate containing the gel pieces using needles and removes liquid through laser made holes on the bottom of the plate by applying nitrogen pressure as previously described. (10) Prepare 18 ng/μl bovine trypsin and place inside the automated robot in its inactive form by storing in acidic conditions (10 % (v/v) acetonitrile, 1 mM HCl). - Wash gels with 50 μl acetonitrile and 50 μl 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 for 15 min. Remove supernatant. Dehydrate gels with 100 μl acetonitrile for 10 min. Remove acetonitrile. - Reduce proteins in the gel with 30 μl 10 mM DTT in 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 for 10 min at 60 °C. Remove supernatant once the samples have cooled (20 min). - Alkylate gel proteins with 30 μl 50 mM iodoacetamide in 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 for 15 min. Remove iodoacetamide solution. - Wash gel pieces with 50 μl 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 for 15 min. Remove 50 mM NH 4 HCO 3. Dehydrate gels twice with 50 μl acetonitrile for 15 min. Remove acetonitrile. Pause workstation for 10 min to allow drying. - Activate trypsin by diluting it 2 -fold with 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3. Add 15 μl of this 9 ng/ml trypsin solution to each gel piece and leave for 10 min to allow gel swelling. Incubate gel pieces at 37 °C for 2 h. Add 10 μl water to compensate for any water loss. Incubate gel pieces at 37 °C for a further 2 h. - Add 10 μl 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 to each gel piece and incubate for 10 min. Add 20 μl acetonitrile and leave for 10 min to dehydrate the gel. Transfer the supernatant to a 96 well collection plate. - Add 20 μl 10 % (v/v) formic acid to the gels and leave for 10 min to extract the peptides. Add supernatant to the collection plate. Dehydrate gels with 30 μl acetonitrile for 15 min. Add supernatant to the collection plate. - Dry pooled extracts completely in a SpeedVac and reconstitute peptides by dissolving in 0. 1 % (v/v) formic acid. Perform mass spectrometric analysis as previously described.

Successful lung cancer therapies in patients require preliminary investigations of promising therapeutic reagents in animal models. This protocol describes a method to induce lung tumours in mice and to deliver an immunoregulatory molecule directly to the lung by intranasal application. Here we describe the usage of murine cell lines L 1 C 2 and B 16 F 10 for the induction of lung adenocarcinoma or metastatic melanoma respectively. In this model the tumour cells are injected intravenously in the tail vein of the mice. To apply therapeutic reagents locally in the lung during tumour growth, the mice are anaesthetized and the therapeutic molecule is applied drop by drop into the nose of the mouse at different time points after tumour induction. To monitor the outcome of the therapy tumour size can be defined by analyzing Haematoxilin/Eosin stained slices of the lung. ### Introduction Advancements in novel therapies for lung cancer in patients require an understanding and monitoring of the immune response mechanisms in humans as well as improvements of the experimental model of the disease. To investigate the immune responses in lung cancer, mouse models are a helpful tool. In our laboratory we standardized a method to induce lung cancer and to apply therapeutic molecules to the lungs of mice. The technique of lung tumour induction facilitates the analysis of the effects of different therapeutical molecules in the anti-tumour immune response. Here we show two models of lung tumours, the B 16 -F 10 metastatic melanoma model and the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma model. Previous studies have been performed in our group both in wild type and in knockout mice in the melanoma model (1) as well as in the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma model (2). Tumour development can be analyzed at different stages after intravenous tumour cell injection. It can be evaluated by quantifying the lung areas which are invaded with tumour cells on the lung surface as well as by analyzing lung sections stained with Haematoxilin/Eosin. Our laboratory showed that intranasal application of particular neutralizing antibodies as well as other biological active molecules ensures a localized effect in the lung (3 - 5). Using this protocol we repeatedly achieved a reduction of lung tumour growth in the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma mouse model after intranasal application of a neutralizing anti-IL 17 A antibody (6). In contrast to other methods like intraperitoneal or intravenous injection of therapeutical molecules, the intranasal protocol provides the possibility to deliver the therapy directly to the affected lung. ### Reagents **Tumour cell induction** 1.

T 48402) and t-Amyl-Alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich; cat. no. 152463) ### Equipment **Tumour cell induction** 1. CO 2 incubator (5 % CO 2, 37 °C) - centrifuge - pipets with disposable tips - pipettor - single-use plastic pipets (Greiner Bio-One) - cell culture flasks 25 cm 2, 75 cm 2, 175 cm 2 (Greiner Bio-One; cat no 690170, 658175, 661175) - 50 ml conic tubes (Greiner Bio-One) - syringes (B Braun; cat. no. 9161502) - injection chamber (Föhr medical instruments; Broome HAR- 52 - 04) - Neubauer chamber-improved (Marienfeld-Superior; cat. no. 0640010) - Erlenmeyer flask - light microscope (Axio Observer.

We suggest using 2 × 10 e 5 tumour cells per mouse for intravenous injection in the tail vein. The experimental procedure takes approximately 21 days. In case of using other mouse strains than wild type mice, the number of cells for injection and the time duration of the experiment needs to be tested and established first. Intranasal application of antibodies can be performed at different time points as well as in different dosages after tumour cell injection. The amount of antibody depends on the amount of protein you intend to neutralize in the lung. The data sheet of the antibody or previous publications might give a hint. As a possible control animals can be treated with PBS or the corresponding isotype antibody instead of the specific blocking antibody. We suggest the application of the antibody at two time points after tumour cell injection (Figure 1). To analyze the tumour growth, lung tissue can be embedded in paraffin cut into 4 micrometers thick sections which will be then stained with Hemtaoxilin/Eosin (H&E;) in accordance to standardized histological laboratory protocols. Afterwards the tumour-bearing area can be analyzed. For this purpose, stained sections can be displayed on a computer monitor with a computer linked Nikon Coolscan V ED scanner using the Program SF launcher thereby determining the ratio of the area of the lung section occupied by tumour to the lung section tumour-free area. To classify the tumour type the affected areas the slide must be further analyzed with a light microscope (e. g. Zeiss Axio Observer. D 1; Axio Vision 4. 7 software) using different magnifications. **Tumour induction** REAGENT SETUP Prepare the cell culture media DMEM + 10 % FCS, + 1 % penicillin/streptomycin for B 16 F 10 cells and RPMI + 10 % FCS, + 1 % penicillin/streptomycin for L 1 C 2 cells and store it at 4 °C. PROCEDURE - **Preparation of reagents** 1. Prepare the cell culture media as described above and warm it at 37 °C. - TIMING: 5 min. - <b>PAUSE</b> <b>POINT!</b> Can be stored at 4 °C up to 1 month. - **Thawing tumour cells** - Transfer the frozen cells from liquid nitrogen into a tube and dissolve them by using media. - After full thawing, centrifuge the cells at 91 g (800 rpm) for 7 min, 4 °C. - Discard the supernatant completely and resuspend the cells in 10 ml media. - Culture the cells 1 - 2 days in a 50 ml culture flask until 70 - 80 % confluency is achieved (Figure 2 a, b). - TIMING: 10 - 15 min. - **Splitting the cells** - Drop off the culture media and wash the cells with 10 ml PBS. - Pipette accutase into the flask and incubate for 1 - 2 min at 37 °C. - use 0. 5 ml of accutase for 25 cm 2 flasks, 1 ml for 75 cm 2 and 2 ml for 175 cm 2 flasks - Detach the cells from the flask surface by beating the flask. - Apply 10 ml of media to stop the accutase reaction and transfer the cell suspension into a tube. - Centrifuge at 91 g for 7 min, 4 °C and discard the supernatant. - Resuspend the cell pellet in media, cultivate and expand the cells in a 75 cm 2 or 175 cm 2 flask. - use 25 ml for 75 cm 2 and 50 ml media for a 175 cm 2 flask. - TIMING: 15 min. - **Cell harvesting and injection** - Repeat steps 6 - 10. - Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml media. - Mix 10 µl of the cell suspension with 10 µl trypan blue. - Fill 10 µl of the mix in the chamber and count the cells in four squares (Q 1 -Q 4, see Figure 2 c) - Calculate the cell number as follows: (Q 1 + Q 2 + Q 3 +Q 4) / 4 × 2 (trypan blue dilution) x 10 e 4 = cell number/ml cell suspension - Transfer the calculated cell volume (2 × 105 cells per mouse) into a tube and centrifuge at 91 g for 7 min, 4 °C. - Use sterofundin to resuspend B 16 -F 10 cells or RPMI to resuspend L 1 C 2 cells to a concentration of 1 × 10 e 6 cells/ml (200 µl/ 2 × 10 e 5 cells will be injected in a mouse). - Prepare an Erlenmeyer flask with hand warm water. - Fix the mouse in the injection chamber and put the tail into the Erlenmeyer flask for 30 sec. Alternatively, the tail can also be warmed using an infrared lamp. - Take up 200 µl cell suspension in the syringe. - Insert the syringe horizontally in the tail vein of the mouse and inject the cell suspension slowly (Figure 2 d). - TIMING: 30 min. **Intranasal application** REAGENT SETUP - Prepare the solution for intranasal treatment and store it on ice. For this purpose make-up the stock concentration of the antibody or of the therapeutical molecule according to the manufacturer´s protocol (often in buffer containing BSA). Dilutions of antibodies or other therapeutical molecules, to set up the working solution for intranasal delivery, should be done with sterofundin or NaCl. Antibody-working solutions can be stored at - 20 °C for a few weeks. CAUTION! The volume for intranasal application should be 25 - 40 µl. - Prepare the anaesthetic - A) isoflurane ready to use solution - B) avertin - b 1. Dissolve 1 g 2, 2, 2 -Tribromo-Ethanol in 1 ml t-Amyl-Alcohol - b 2. Ad 39 ml PBS and vortex until total dissolving - b 3. Store the solution protected from light at 4 °C - C) ketamin (12 mg/ml) /xylazin (0, 08 ml/ml) in PBS, stored at 4 °C Ketamin can be stored at 4 °C for a few weeks. Avertin can be stored at 4 °C for a few days. CAUTION! All experiments should be performed according to national and institutional guidelines for animal care and use. PROCEDURE 1 Prepare the antibody suspension as described above and store it on ice. - Anaesthetize the mice. This step can be performed using options A, B or C. - A) inject 200 µl avertin intraperitonally (i. p) into the mice or - B) inject 60 - 70 µl ketamin i. p or - C) use the isoflurane system - c 1. prepare the isoflurane-equipment according to the manufacturer´s instructions - c 2. put the mice in the plastic chamber and anaesthetize the mice by flooding the box with isolflurane/oxygen CAUTION! Increase the doses of isoflurane slowly - By the time the mouse is immobilized and the heart beat is getting slower, clamp the mouse in the neck and tilt the head back. Pipet the solution carefully, drop-wise into the nose of the mouse, so that the mouse inhales the solution. - Wait until the mouse wakes up. After Avertin and Ketamin treatment the mouse needs approximately 30 min to get awake. Anaesthesia duration after isoflurane treatment is about 5 min. Use an infrared lamp to warm the mouse until it is awake. - CAUTION! If you use ketamin or avertin for anaesthesia wait 24 h to anaesthetize the mice again. Repeated use might be harmful for the mouse. - TIMING: 10 - 15 min. ### Anticipated Results **Tumor induction** Tumour cells (Figure 2 a, b) which are intravenously injected in the mouse tail vein (Figure 2 d) reach the lung and begin to grow. They form colonies and expand. The lung surface is afflicted by tumour cell colonies which can differ in size and number. In case of the B 16 -F 10 metastatic melanoma model the cell colonies can be recognized as black areas on the lung surface (Figure 3 a). Usually the whole lung surface is affected at day 28 - 33 after tumour cell injection with B 16 -F 10 cells causing the death of the mice (1). In case of the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma model 10 - 20 % of the lung area is occupied by the tumour 21 days after tumour cell injection. In addition to the tumour in the lung, L 1 C 2 -treated mice often develop metastases in the thorax. On H&E; stained slices the growing colonizing tumour cells are observable as high dense, purple, round regions (Figure 3 b, c) **Intranasal application** Intranasal application of antibodies allows the evaluation of new experimental therapeutical strategies for the local treatment of lung diseases such as lung cancer. The antibody can directly target cells or proteins in the lung, without covering long distances as after intraperitoneal or intravenous applications. The antibody reaches the nasal cavity as the mouse inhales the solution drop-wise (Figure 4). Using the isoflurane system anaesthesia only lasts for few minutes. ### References 1. Sauer, K. A. et al.

MultiLabel allows the modular assembly of independent expression units in a single plasmid {{which can be used}} for transient and stable {{modification of}} cells. In contrast to other methods, the assembly of the expression cassettes does not require restriction enzymes since it is recombination based. Here we describe strategies how genes of interest are efficiently cloned into MultiLabel vectors and how these expression vectors can be assembled by a Cre/LoxP reaction to a multigene plasmid. In addition, we describe how such plasmids are used to generate stable cell lines. Cloning and assembling of up to three plasmids is possible within two weeks, the insertion of a fourth and fifth expression cassette within another two weeks, and the generation of a stable cell line takes one to two months. ### Introduction The simultaneous expression of multiple proteins in mammalian cells is an important technology in contemporary biological research. For instance, the coexpression of several fluorescently tagged sensors allows the concurrent observation of multiple parameters in living cells (1). In addition, the simultaneous insertion of several genes is often necessary to change the fate of a cell e. g. when generating induced pluripotent stem cells (2). Finally, the molecular and structural analysis of multiprotein complexes needs the heterologeous expression of proteins in an appropriate host. Many strategies were developed in the last years to overcome the currently existing technical limitations. Cotransfection of independent expression constructs is the easiest strategy but it leads to a heterogeneous cell population with variable expression levels. It becomes especially inefficient if the cell line is difficult to transfect and if more than three proteins need to be expressed. Coinfection with numerous viruses may help, but the handling of viruses needs special safety requirements (3). The different expression units can be assembled in a large plasmid with restriction enzymes but this strategy can not be standardized due to the limited number of restriction enzymes and the occasional occurrence of their recognition sites in genes of interest. IRES-based constructs are often used for the expression of two proteins (4). Multiple proteins can also be expressed as a large precursor protein which is then processed by (self-) cleavage into its individual proteins. This strategy leads to proteins with modified N- and C-termini interfering sometimes with the functionality of the protein (5). We previously used Cre/LoxP-mediated recombination to assemble multiple independent expression units in a single plasmid for production of protein complexes in Sf 21 and E. coli cells for structural analyses (6 7). Recombination-mediated assembly has the advantage that no restriction enzymes are necessary and that the expression vectors are therefore freely interchangeable. In addition, no special equipment laboratories are required. We recently developed a set of vectors, called MultiLabel, which allows the Cre/LoxP mediated multigene expression in mammalian cells (8). It is possible to combine one acceptor vector with up to 4 donor vectors. These vectors have minimal backbone size to maximize transfection efficiency and they contain elements for the generation of stable cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 1). Here we describe the necessary steps to generate stable cell lines including cloning of the genes of interest in a MultiLabel vector backbone (Fig. 1 A, steps 1 – 3), Cre/LoxP-mediated assembly of these vectors (Fig. 1 B, steps 4 – 6), and transfection and selection of mammalian cell lines (Fig. 1 C, steps 7 – 13). **Experimental Design** The choice of the appropriate acceptor vector is crucial for the successful application of our method. Ideally, the acceptor vector contains the gene of interest which is part of all planned multigene expression plasmids and which remains unmodified in all assemblies. The currently available acceptor vectors contain different resistance genes for the selection of stable cell lines. We recommend the use of pSI-AKR 8 which contains a zeocin and a G 418 resistance gene. These two genes are separated by a homing endonuclease site (I-SceI) which can be used for linearization prior to transfection (Figure 1 C). Several acceptor vectors contain an FRT site from the Flp-In system of Invitrogen. The Flp-In system allows the Flippase-mediated integration of a plasmid at a defined site of the genome of a mammalian cell with an FRT site. We successfully integrated plasmids with a size up to 15 kb with this strategy. The choice of the donor vector is less crucial. These vectors are available with four different antibiotic resistance genes (ampicillin, spectinomycin, chloramphenicol, and gentamycin). A version with and without a cleavage site for the homing endonuclease I-CeuI exists for each antibiotic resistance gene. Additional expression cassettes can be inserted at this site by conventional cloning (see Supplementary Fig. S 6 in Kriz et al. 2010 for details). Note that this site must not be used for the linearization step for the generation of stable cell lines because linearization at this point prevents expression of the upstream expression cassette. Classical cloning with restriction enzymes is described in the protocol but other methods such as SLIC or PCR-based methods can be used as well (9, 10). This is possible since not only the cloning sites are identical in all MultiLabel plasmids but also the adjacent 15 bp. The vectors do not contain a classical multi-cloning site. We used instead SapI (LguI) sites which allow seamless cloning (see Supplementary Figure S 1 in Kriz et al. 2010 for details). This approach is not recomended if the gene of interest contains an internal SapI (LguI) site. Circular plasmids are the first choice for transient transfections, but the plasmids must be lineralized for the generation of stable cell lines. We never obtained a cell line expressing four or five transgenes when using circular plasmids. The described method applies to the generation of stable porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. For other cell types, the method of transfection and the concentration of the selection antibiotics have to be adjusted. The text for the entire protocol can be found here: [Protocol in its entirety. doc]([URL] ### Reagents 1. Cre recombinase and 10 × reaction buffer (NEB) - Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase in 2 × HF or 2 × GC buffer (Finnzymes) - PCR primers (see Supplementary Figure 2 for details) - Paraffin wax beads (e. g. Fluka Chemika, # 411671) - DpnI, AscI (SgsI), SapI (LguI), and PacI (NEB, Fermentas) - QIAprep Gel Extraction kit, QIAprep PCR purification kit (Qiagen) - Spin Miniprep kit - T 4 DNA ligase, 10 × T 4 DNA ligase buffer (Fermentas) - LB low-salt medium (Difco) - DMEM or HAM-F 12 serum free medium (Amimed) - Fetal calf serum (Amimed) - Penicillin-Streptomycin (Invitrogen) - FuGENE HD (Roche) - Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (Gibco) - Template DNA (genomic, plasmid or cDNA) - E. coli competent cells: TOP 10, DH 10 β, BW 23473 (pir+) - MultiLabel vectors (“Supplementary Figure 1 ”:[URL] - Antibiotics (see Table 1) ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") ### Equipment 1. Thermocycler - Equipment for agarose gel electrophoresis - Electroporator and cuvettes - Tissue culture Laboratory ### Procedure **Construction of MultiLabel vectors with a single expression cassette** 1. This step can be performed using option A, B or C depending on the available template. Use option A, if a suitable expression cassette with a promoter, the gene of interest, and a polyA signal already exists. Standard primers for pcDNA (Invitrogen) or pEGFP type (Clontech) vector are described in this paper (Fig. 2 A). Use option B, if a protein with an N-terminal fluorescent protein tag is needed (Fig. 2 B). Use option C for the restriction enzyme free insertion of a coding region at any place in the MultiLabel vector (Fig. 2 C). A. **First option**: This strategy inserts an existing expression cassette into MultiLabel vectors by conventional cloning. An existing expression cassette of a pcDNA (Invitrogen) or pEGFP-type (Clontech) vector is amplified by PCR using primers containing AscI and PacI restriction enzyme sites, and then cloned into a AscI- / PacI- cut MultiLabel vector (Fig. 2 A). This strategy does not work, if your fragment contains an AscI or PacI site (in this situation ligate 3 fragments, use SLIC or a PCR-based method as described in option 1 C). See the attached document for details on how to do this. [Procedure and Troubleshooting. doc]([URL] B. **Second option**: This option describes the insertion of a gene of interest downstream of the coding region of a fluorescent protein by conventional cloning. MultiLabel vectors contain two SapI (LguI) restriction sites which generate non cohesive ends {{that can be used to}} exchange the linker fragment with your gene of interest (Fig. 2 B). Make sure the SapI recognition sequence is not present in the genes you are cloning. See the attached document for details on how to do this. Procedure and Troubleshooting. doc C. **Third option**: Seamless cloning using restriction free methods can be used to insert DNA sequences at any place of MultiLabel vectors. Add a 15 – 20 bases 5 ′-tail to the primers containing DNA sequences that are homologous to the sequences flanking the site of insertion into the MultiLabel vector. The described primers bind to the 3 ’ end of the CMV promoter (RF-CMV-for) and to the 5 ’ end of the poly A signal (RF-PolyA-back, Fig 2 C). This method has two PCR steps. In the first PCR the gene of interest is amplified and this PCR fragment replaces in the second step the linker of the MultiLabel vector. See the attached document for details on how to do this. Procedure and Troubleshooting. doc **CRITICAL STEPS** Steps 1 Ai, 1 Bi, 1 Ci, and 1 Civ It is critical to use a high fidelity proof-reading polymerase with a low error rate. We use Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase in 2 × HF buffer, but the use of other polymerases is possible. The use of the wax beads reduces non-specific amplification during the PCR. Other hot start methods than wax beads are applicable but more expensive. Steps 1 Aiv, 1 Biv, and 1 Ciii DpnI removes methylated parental DNA and hemimethylated hybrids of one parental and one PCR synthesized strand. Otherwise methylated parental DNA and hemimethylated hybrids would give rise to high background after transformation. 2. Use 0. 5 μl of ligation or restriction free reaction to transform competent E. coli cells (TOP 10 or DH 10  for acceptor plasmids or BW 23474 for donor plasmids) and select on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic for selection (depending on the vector of choice; see Table 1). Incubate overnight at 37 °C. - **CRITICAL STEP** The correct bacterial strain has to be chosen for transforming cloning products. Donor plasmids and derivatives contain a conditional origin of replication derived from R 6 Kγ and have to be propagated in cell strains expressing the pir gene such as BW 23474. Acceptor plasmids and derivatives can be propagated in common laboratory bacterial strains (for example, TOP 10 or DH 10 β). TROUBLESHOOTING 3. Pick 2 - 10 white colonies (see Supplementary Fig. 2 A) and inoculate small scale cultures in LB media containing the appropriate antibiotic. The isolated plasmids should then be analyzed by restriction mapping using restriction enzymes. - **CRITICAL STEP** Phusion polymerase has a low error rate. Nonetheless, it is advisable to verify the inserted gene by sequencing. **Creating multigene expression plasmids** 4. Set up plasmid assembly reactions for 3 MultiLabel vectors in a 10 μl volume. - ddH 2 O:— 2 μl - 10 × Cre reaction buffer:— 1 μl - Acceptor plasmid (1 μg) :— 2 μl - Donor plasmid 1 (1 μg) :— 2 μl - Donor plasmid 2 (1 μg) :— 2 μl - Cre recombinase:— 1 μl Incubate for 1 hour at 37 °C. - **CRITICAL STEP** Cre recombinase is a very sensitive enzyme; therefore DNA should be purified with an anion exchange kit. One or two donor plasmids can be routinely assembled with one acceptor plasmid. The third and fourth donor plasmids should be inserted in a sequential manner with triple-assembled and four-assembled multigene plasmid, respectively. 5. Use 0. 5 μl of the Cre recombinase reaction to transform competent E. coli cells (for example, TOP 10 or DH 10 β). Plate the cells on LB agar plates containing appropriate combination of antibiotics (Supplementary Fig. 2 B, Table 1). Incubate overnight at 30 °C. 6. Pick 2 - 10 colonies to grow small scale cultures for plasmid isolation in LB media containing the corresponding antibiotics. The isolated plasmids should then be analyzed by restriction mapping using appropriate restriction enzymes. - TROUBLESHOOTING - <b>PAUSE</b> <b>POINT</b> Plasmids can be stored at 4 °C. ** Generation of stable cell lines** **Linearization of the multigene plasmid** Several acceptor vectors contain a recognition site for the homing endonuclease I-SceI (Supplementary Figure 1). If one of your genes of interest contains a I-SceI restriction site, the BstZ 17 I restriction enzyme can be used to linearize the multigene vector. The BstZ 17 I restriction site is localized on the border between Kanamycin and FRT regions and will not interfere with mammalian expression. 7. Set up preparative restriction digestion reaction in 50 μl volume each: - MultiLabel multigene vector (50 μg) — x μl - 10 × digestion buffer (Tango) — 5 μl - I-SceI restriction enzyme — 1 μl - ddH 20 — till 50 μl Incubate for 16 h at 37 °C. 8. Run an analytic agarose gel to check if the multigene vector is linearized completely. Purify the linearized multigene plasmid using the QIAprep PCR purification kit or phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. - **CRITICAL STEP** It is very important that the multigene plasmid is completely linearized prior transfection into the mammalian cells. 9. Measure the concentration of the linearized multigene plasmid. **Preparation of mammalian cells for transfection in 10 cm tissue culture plate** Note that this is our lab standard cell culture protocol for transfection of HEK 293 and PAE cells. The protocol may need some adaptations or other cell types. 10. Plate HEK 293 or PAE cells 6 - 9 hours prior transfection in 10 cm dishes. Cells should be 30 - 40 % confluent prior to transfection. - **CRITICAL STEP** From now on, all steps should be performed in a sterile hood. 11. Mix 5 μg linearized multigene plasmid with 7. 5 μl FuGENE HD transfection reagent in 250 μl serum-free medium (Opti-MEM I). Incubate for 20 min at room temperature before adding to the plated cells. - **CRITICAL STEP** In addition to FuGENE HD, there are several other transfection reagents which can be used (for example, PEI or calcium phosphate). The choice depends on the used cell type. **Selection of stable transfectants** 12. Cells are passed into 2 - 4 10 cm plates 40 h after transfection in different dilutions (1 : 2, 1 : 5, and 1 : 20). Add selection drug one day after replating (Table 1). Replace medium once or twice per week, always add drug. Colonies are visible within 14 - 21 days and should be picked (clone rings with grease for PAE cells or filter cloning discs (Sigma) for HEK 293 cells). Transfer colonies to 1 cm wells and grow in presence of selection drug. Pass into 3. 5 or 6 cm plates and freeze aliquots. ### Troubleshooting - PROBLEM: Steps 1 Av, 1 Bv, and 1 Cv There is no PCR product or multiple unspecific bands. - SOLUTION: Steps 1 Av, 1 Bv, and 1 Cv Use the Phusion GC Buffer for those experiments where amplification with HF Buffer has failed. The GC Buffer can improve the performance of Phusion DNA Polymerase on some difficult or long templates, i. e. GC rich templates or those with complex secondary structures. Alternatively, several PCR reactions can be pooled to obtain more PCR product. If non-specific multiple bands are present, annealing temperature may have to be optimized or hot start didn’t work. - PROBLEM: Steps 2 a) There is high background of parental plasmids after transformation. b) No transformants were obtained. - SOLUTION: Steps 2 a) Digest 10 – 12 h or overnight with 20 – 40 units DpnI enzyme. b) More colonies can be obtained by using highly competent commercial cells. PCR fragments are sometimes difficult to cut and ligate. But they can be cloned easily into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and purified from there as a fragment. Please note that Phusion Polymerase does not generate A overhangs. Therefore an additional incubation with Taq polymerase prior to ligation is necessary. - PROBLEM: Steps 6 a) No transformants were obtained. b) Plasmids can not be cut or are only partially cut by restriction enzymes. - SOLUTION_ Steps 6 a) The transformation efficiency of fusions can be increased by culturing the transformed cells overnight at 30 ºC in liquid culture containing appropriate antibiotics prior to plating and/ or the use of highly competent commercial cells. Antibiotic concentrations were reduced to 50 % when 4 or 5 plasmids were assembled. b) Rearrangement or denaturation of plasmids during growth can be eliminated by culturing the bacteria in LB medium at 30 ºC rather than at 37 ºC. ### References 1.

We have developed a protocol that facilitates the genetic code reprogramming using flexizymes integrated with a custom-made in-vitro translation apparatus, {{referred to as the}} flexible in-vitro translation (FIT) system. Flexizymes are flexible tRNA acylation ribozymes that enable the preparation of a diverse array of non-proteinogenic acyl-tRNAs. These acyl-tRNAs read vacant codons created in the FIT system, yielding the desired non-standard peptides with diverse exotic structures, such as N-methyl amino acids, D-amino acids and physiologically stable macrocyclic scaffolds. We here describe a protocol for the preparation of DNA templates for flexizymes, tRNAs, microhelix RNA, and mRNAs that are used for genetic code reprogramming with flexizymes. ### Reagents 1.
