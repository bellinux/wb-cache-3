In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes {{they are going to}} wear for Halloween, and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her a silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.|$|E

His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It just seemed kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some seemed happy when he was out. But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he was <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E

25|$|Three centuries were {{recorded}} at Old Trafford, as Gloucestershire Gladiators snatched {{a victory over}} the hosting Lancashire Lightning after being regarded with no chance earlier on. The Gladiators won the toss and got immediate success, as Jon Lewis dismissed Mal Loye with the second ball of the day, but <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> went against Gloucestershire from then on, as Stuart Law, Mark Chilton and Andrew Symonds flayed the bowling to all corners. Symonds took 88 balls for his century, {{and went on to}} make 129 before being bowled by James Averis - who finished with four for 40. Law and Chilton also made fifties, but Averis' late spell and a slow 39-ball 11 from Marcus North ensured that the total ended on 267 for 7. Then, James Anderson had three men caught off his bowling, as Gloucestershire crashed to 47 for 4. However, Anderson finished his spell, and Ramnaresh Sarwan crafted a century - which was shortly followed by Mark Hardinges reaching his first one-day century of his career, and in the process lifting his List A career batting average from 14.23 to 17.50, still below par for a specialist batsman like Hardinges. However, the pair added 221 runs in 116 minutes for the fifth wicket, hitting six sixes along the way, as they guided Gloucestershire out of the relegation zone in the National League.|$|E

Wales noted that Tennant and Tate [...] "relished" [...] the {{perpetual}} swings from [...] "square-jawed serious" [...] to [...] "faintly sadistic subversion", to mess with audience expectations. Ryan's performance as Staal was again praised, but Wales felt Agyeman still displayed [...] "the charisma and range of a dead fish, despite Martha's transformation from lovesick sap to Ripley-esque super soldier." [...] Wales summed up that the episode [...] "did <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> a two-part opener should – swiftly shifting the pieces into place for next week's inevitably bombastic showdown." [...] Alan Stanley Bear of Airlock Alpha called [...] "The Sontaran Strategem" [...] an [...] "exciting and nostalgic adventure", {{and said that the}} episode lives up to the show's reputation for transforming a normal object, in this case the car, to a [...] "global killer". Bear praised the episode for Donna and Martha's introduction being opposite to Rose Tyler and Sarah Jane Smith's in [...] "School Reunion", for providing a human element in the subplot where Donna visits her grandfather, and for the episode's cliffhanger. However, Bear wrote that it took too long to [...] "get to the point", and criticized the [...] "bland Sontaran dialogue and the cliched simplicity of mind control", which he felt [...] "reduced {{what could have been a}} fantastically intricate story piece into Saturday morning cartoon material." ...|$|E
500|$|The Court further {{stated that}} {{although}} congress allowed the resale and gifting {{of a gun}} by an individual, without requiring form or background checks, that is not proof that congress did not care about straw buyers. [...] "Yes, Congress decided to regulate dealers’ sales, while leaving the secondary market for guns largely untouched.... And yes, that choice (like <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> <b>everything</b> Congress does) was surely a result of compromise. But no, straw arrangements are {{not a part of}} the secondary market, separate and apart from the dealer’s sale." [...] The Court also rejected Abramski's claim that since Alvarez was able to buy the gun legally on his own the misrepresentation is not material, stating: [...] "Abramski’s false statement was material because had he revealed that he was purchasing the gun on Alvarez’s behalf, the sale could not have proceeded under the law—even though Alvarez turned out to be an eligible gun owner. The sale, as an initial matter, would not have complied with §922(c)’s restrictions on absentee purchases." [...] The court held that Abramski's case is analogous to a situation where a person that can buy a gun legally buys a gun under an alias. Such misrepresentation is material regardless of the fact that the buyer may purchase a gun legally, and the theory of [...] "no harm, no foul" [...] should not apply. Finally, the Court rejected Abramski's claim that the misrepresentation is not in violation of §924, because it is not part of what the dealer is statutorily required to maintain on his record. The Court held that §924 requires the dealer to maintain information [...] "required by this chapter", and that ATF Form 4473 is required by this chapter.|$|E

It was like they were there, making the film with us." [...] — Chad Keith, on his late auto mechanic father, and the magical feeling felt when making Loving. Production designer Chad Keith, who worked with Nichols previously on Take Shelter (2011) and Midnight Special (2016), commented that the greatest creative challenge was to do justice to the Lovings, while also acknowledging his interest in working on a film about actual living persons. Keith stressed the importance of the location, to which his team an himself tried to match up the locations to where and how the Lovings lived, in which he explained, [...] "There are different sorts of income levels represented throughout their whole family that we wanted to show in the film. We bounced around all over Virginia and in D.C." [...] Keith remarked that it was his first period piece, and from the beginning, {{one of the first things}} Nichols asked was whether he thought we could pull it off, to which he stated, [...] "I was certain we could." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{summary of}} my {{impression}} reading the OpenSolaris code was that I was... surprised....the OpenSolaris code, as I saw it, was neat. Real neat. Extremely neat. In fact, I found it painful to read after a while. It was so neatly laid out that I found myself admiring it. It {{seems to have}} been built like an aircraft. It has everything that opens and shuts, has code for just about everything I've ever seen considered on a scheduler, and it's all neatly laid out in clean code and even comments. It also appears to have been coded with an awful lot of effort to ensure it's robust and measurable, with checking and tracing elements at every corner. I started to feel a little embarrassed by what we have as our own Linux kernel. The more I looked at the OpenSolaris code, the more it felt like it <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> did <b>everything</b> the Linux kernel has been trying to do for ages. Not only that, but it's built like an aircraft, whereas ours looks like a garage job with duct tape by comparison....OpenSolaris looks like an excellent design for a completely different purpose. It's built like a commercial design for commercial purposes that have very different requirements than what most of us use Linux for, but it does appear to have been done so very well. It looks like a goddamn Star Destroyer, and the Linux kernel (scheduler) suddenly looks like the Millennium Falcon. Real fast, but held together with duct tape, and ready to explode at any minute.|$|R
