25|$|This approach, {{which is}} not {{compatible}} with Windows Group Policy, was repeated in Windows XP. The reasons for this design decision by Microsoft are not known, and it has resulted in heavy criticism. Microsoft significantly improved this in Windows Vista by redesigning the <b>power</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> to allow basic configuration by Group Policy. The support offered {{is limited to a}} single per-computer policy. The most recent release, Windows 7 retains these limitations but does include refinements for timer coalescing, processor power management, and display panel brightness. The most significant change in Windows 7 is in the user experience. The prominence of the default High Performance power plan has been reduced with the aim of encouraging users to save power.|$|E

40|$|In this study, an interval-parameter minimax regret {{programming}} (IMRP) {{method is}} developed {{for supporting the}} <b>power</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> planning under uncertainty. This method incorporates techniques of interval linear programming (ILP) and minimax regret programming (MRP) within a general optimization framework. The developed IMRP could deal with multiple policy scenarios associated with different costs and risk levels without making any assumptions. It can analyze various economic consequences {{for all of the}} possible scenarios through minimizing the maximum cost regret values. The IMRP approach can successfully reduce the worst regrets incurred under the pre-regulated targets. Moreover, it can deal with uncertainties and complexities expressed as interval numbers. A case study of <b>power</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> planning is then presented for demonstrating applicability of the developed approach. The results indicate that many decision alternatives are generated based on the interval solutions which can help decision makers identify the desired system designs with minimized economic cost loss and system-failure risk under uncertainty. The trade-off between system regret and security-failure risk can be handled effectively through this method. And the generated solutions can also provide multiple electric power generation patterns and capacity expansion schemes under the optimal strategy obtained through the developed IMRP method. It is indicated that the proposed method is efficient to provide the decision makers with available plans in actual operation of <b>power</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems.</b> Decision making <b>Power</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> Interval-parameter Minimax regret Optimization Uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|In this study, an inexact coupled {{coal and}} <b>power</b> <b>management</b> (ICCPM) model was {{developed}} for planning coupled coal and <b>power</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> through integrating chance-constrained programming (CCP), interval linear programming (ILP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. The ICCPM model can effectively handle uncertainties presented in terms of probability density functions and intervals. It can also facilitate dynamic analysis of capacity expansions, facility installation and coal inventory planning within a multi-period and multi-option context. Complexities in coupled coal and <b>power</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> can be systematically reflected in this model, thus applicability of the modeling process would be highly enhanced. The developed ICCPM model was applied to a case of long-term coupled coal and <b>power</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> planning in north China. Interval solutions associated with different risk levels of constraint violations have been obtained, {{which can be used}} for generating decision alternatives and helping identify desired policies. The generated results can also provide desired solutions for coal and power generation, capacity initiation and expansion, and coal blending with a minimized system cost, a maximized system reliability and a maximized coal transportation security.
