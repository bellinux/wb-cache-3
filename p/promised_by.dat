5|$|An episode {{centered}} on Betty had been <b>promised</b> <b>by</b> the crew at San Diego Comic-Con International in 2012. Due {{to the subject}} matter and length of the episode, several scenes had to be cut or trimmed for time, since so much was being placed in the episode. A review by Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club was complimentary towards the story, and Sava also applauded Dunham's voice-acting.|$|E

5|$|After {{his return}} to Baghdad, Bahá'u'lláh tried to revive the Bábí community, mostly through correspondence, writing {{extensively}} to give the Bábís {{a new understanding of}} the Bábí religion, while keeping his perceived station as the one <b>promised</b> <b>by</b> the Báb and a Manifestation of God hidden. He was soon recognized by the Bábís, as well as government authorities, as the foremost Bábí leader, and there was {{a growing number of people}} joining the Bábí movement. He also gained sympathy from government officials and Sunni clerics. Bahá'u'lláh's rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community, gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian government. The Persian government asked the Ottoman government to extradite Bahá'u'lláh to Persia, but the Ottoman government refused and instead chose to move Bahá'u'lláh from the sensitive border region to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Although the GWR {{agreed to}} {{contribute}} £175,000 {{and a similar}} sum was <b>promised</b> <b>by</b> the GNR, sufficient funds to make a start on construction had not been raised {{by the end of}} 1857. Costs were reduced by cutting back part of the route at the western end so that it did not connect directly to the GWR station, and by dropping the line south of Farringdon. In 1858, Pearson arranged a deal between the Met and the City of London Corporation whereby the Met bought land it needed around the new Farringdon Road from the City for £179,000 and the City purchased £200,000 worth of shares. The route changes were approved by Parliament in August 1859, meaning that the Met finally had the funding to match its obligations and construction could begin.|$|E
5|$|As <b>promised</b> <b>by</b> Fillmore, treaty commissioners {{arrived in}} La Pointe in 1854 to {{conclude}} a final treaty. Recalling {{the experiences of}} 1837 and 1842, the Ojibwa leaders sought to control the negotiations in 1854. Ambiguity in those treaties had been partially to blame for ensuing problems, so Buffalo insisted he would accept no interpreter other than Armstrong, whom he referred to as his adopted son. The Ojibwa insisted on a guarantee {{of the right to}} hunt, fish, and gather on all the ceded territory, and on the establishment on several reservations across western Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northeastern Minnesota. In his mid-nineties and in failing health, Buffalo directed the negotiations but left most of the speaking to other chiefs. He entrusted Armstrong with taking care of the details in the written version.|$|E

5|$|As <b>promised</b> <b>by</b> Massasoit, {{numerous}} Native Americans {{arrived at}} Plymouth {{throughout the middle}} of 1621 with pledges of peace. On July 2, a party of Pilgrims led by Edward Winslow (who later became the chief diplomat of the colony) set out to continue negotiations with the chief. The delegation also included Squanto, who acted as a translator. After traveling for several days, they arrived at Massasoit's capital, the village of Sowams near Narragansett Bay. After meals and an exchange of gifts, Massasoit agreed to an exclusive trading pact with the English; thus, the French were no longer welcome, though they were also frequent traders in the area. Squanto remained behind and traveled throughout the area to establish trading relations with several tribes.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough had won his {{bridgehead}} {{over the}} Danube, and had put himself between the French and Vienna; yet {{the battle was}} followed by a curious, dragging anti-climax. The Duke was determined to lure the Elector into battle before Tallard arrived with reinforcements, but since the battle on the Schellenberg neither Allied commander could agree on their next move, resulting in a protracted siege of Rain. Due to the initial lack of heavy guns and ammunition (<b>promised</b> <b>by</b> the Empire but not delivered on time) the town did not fall until 16 July. Nevertheless, Marlborough promptly occupied Neuburg which, together with Donauwörth and Rain, provided the Allies with enough fortified bridges across the Danube and Lech rivers to manoeuvre with ease.|$|E

He was then shot through the thigh, and continued to refuse treatment. A few minutes later {{he was killed by}} an explosive shell fired by a Japanese vessel. Admiral Ding Ruchang, in command of the fleet, surrendered on 12 February, and committing suicide shortly afterwards. In exchange for the surrender of all war material including the fleet, good behaviour was <b>promised</b> <b>by</b> the Japanese. Jiyuan was later commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy as Saien, the same Chinese character name.|$|E

5|$|The {{men came}} close to mutiny at Aux Cayes in February 1819 when MacGregor failed to produce the 80 silver dollars per man on arrival <b>promised</b> <b>by</b> his recruiters. MacGregor persuaded South American merchants in Haiti to support him with funds, weapons and ammunition, but then procrastinated and gave the order to sail for the island of San Andrés, off the Spanish-controlled Isthmus of Panama, only on 10 March. Going first to Jamaica to arrange {{accommodation}} for Josefa and Gregorio, MacGregor was almost arrested there on charges of gun-running. He joined his troops on San Andrés on 4 April. The delay had led to renewed dissension in the ranks that the stand-in commander Colonel William Rafter had difficulty containing. MacGregor restored morale by announcing that they would set out to attack Porto Bello on the New Granadian mainland the following day.|$|E
5|$|Amangkurat II secured {{his reign}} with {{the defeat of}} the rebels. Due to rebel capture and {{subsequent}} destruction of the capital in Plered, he built a new capital, Kartasura, in the district of Pajang, and moved his court there. A VOC fort was constructed in the capital, next to the royal residence, to defend it against invasion. As for the VOC, its involvement allowed the cornered and nearly defeated AmangkuratII to stay on his throne. This began the precedent of the VOC supporting Javanese kings or claimants in exchange for concessions. However, in 1680 this policy required a high level of expenditure to maintain a military presence in Central and East Java, and this contributed to the VOC's financial decline. The payments <b>promised</b> <b>by</b> Amangkurat were not made, and by 1682 the king's debt to the VOC exceeded 1.5million reals, about five times the amount of the royal treasury. The cession of Semarang was delayed by disputes, and other stipulations in the contract were largely ignored by local Javanese officials. Furthermore, an anti-VOC faction developed at the Mataram court, and a member of this faction, Nerangkusuma, became the patih (chief minister) from 1682 to 1686. Poor relations between Mataram and the VOC continued with the sheltering of Surapati, an enemy of the VOC, in 1684, and the death of VOC captain François Tack in the Mataram court in 1686.|$|E
5|$|In August 1981 {{the program}} {{received}} a boost when British Aerospace (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking the UK's re-entry into the program. The British government was enticed by the lower cost of acquiring Harriers <b>promised</b> <b>by</b> a large production run, {{and the fact}} that the US was shouldering the expense of development. Under the agreement BAe was relegated to the position of a subcontractor, instead of the full partner status that would have been the case had the UK not left the program. Consequently, the company received, in man-hours, 40 percent of the airframe work-share. Aircraft production took place at McDonnell Douglas' facilities in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, and manufacturing by BAe at its Kingston and Dunsfold facilities in Surrey, England. Meanwhile, 75 percent work-share for the engine went to Rolls-Royce, which had previously absorbed Bristol Siddeley, with the remaining 25 percent assigned to Pratt & Whitney. The two companies planned to manufacture 400 Harrier IIs, with the USMC expected to procure 336 aircraft and the RAF, 60.|$|E

5|$|In the 1940s, freight and World War II traffic helped pay {{off some}} of the debt the SIRT had accumulated, and briefly made the SIRT profitable. During the second World War, all of the east coast {{military}} hospital trains were handled by the SIRT, with some trains stopping at Arlington on Staten Island to transfer wounded soldiers to a large military hospital. The need to transport war material, POW trains, and troops, made the stretch of the Baltimore & New York Railway between Cranford Junction and the Arthur Kill extremely busy. The B also operated special trains for important officials such as Winston Churchill. On June 25, 1946, a fire wrecked the terminal at Saint George killing three people, injuring twenty-two people, and causing damage worth $22,000,000. The fire destroyed the ferry terminal and the four slips used for Manhattan service, the terminal for Staten Island Rapid Transit trains. Normal service was not restored until July 13, 1946. Bids to build a temporary terminal went out on August 21, 1946. The construction of a replacement terminal was <b>promised</b> <b>by</b> Mayor William O'Dwyer on February 10, 1948. The new terminal opened on June 8, 1951, with ferry, bus and rail service all within one building. Previous portions of the terminal were phased into service at earlier dates. The new terminal cost $23 million.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a mobile}} war party of 150 Albany militia and Iroquois warriors under Captain John Schuyler marched and canoed {{overland}} to Montreal, imitating the petite guerre tactics (long-range expeditions into enemy territory) perfected by the French colonists. Schuyler's expedition {{was designed to}} seize Montreal and pin French forces south of Quebec, allowing the Boston fleet to sail against the capital unopposed. Smallpox, lack of supplies, and disagreements among the officers caused most of the militia and Iroquois to turn back in disgust, leaving Schuyler with {{a fraction of the}} 855 men <b>promised</b> <b>by</b> the New England authorities. On 4 September the English raiders attacked settlements south of Montreal, killing some 50 habitants {{in the middle of their}} harvests. Too weak to risk a battle with the town's garrison, Schuyler wrapped up the New England invasion and turned home. Thus, when Phips was sighted off Tadoussac, Frontenac ordered the garrisons of Montreal and Trois-Rivières to make for the threatened capital with all haste. Four days later the Governor arrived in Quebec with 200–300 troops freed-up by the failure of Schuyler's invasion, considerably lifting the capital's spirit of resistance.|$|E
5|$|Nationalism in Soviet Georgia gained {{momentum}} in 1989 with {{the weakening of}} the Soviet Union. The Kremlin endorsed South Ossetian nationalism as a counter against the Georgian independence movement. On 11 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Georgia, responding to South Ossetia's attempt at secession, abolished the region's autonomy. Georgia declared its restoration of independence on 9 April 1991, thus becoming the first non-Baltic state of the Soviet Union to do so. A military conflict, which had broken out between Georgia and South Ossetia in January 1991, lasted until June 1992. The separatists were aided by the former Soviet military units now under Russian command. By June 1992, {{the possibility of a}} full-scale war between Russia and Georgia increased as bombing of Georgian capital Tbilisi in support of South Ossetian separatists was <b>promised</b> <b>by</b> Russian authorities. In order to prevent the escalation between Russia and Georgia, a ceasefire agreement was signed on 24 June 1992. Georgian, South Ossetian, Russian and North Ossetian peacekeepers were stationed in South Ossetian conflict zone under the Joint Control Commission's (JCC) mandate. Some, mostly ethnically Georgian parts of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast remained under the Georgian control. The Tskhinvali-based separatist authorities of the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia were in control of one third of the territory of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast before the 2008 war.|$|E
