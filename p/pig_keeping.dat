40|$|Smallholder {{pig farming}} is an {{important}} livelihood source in many rural communities of countries in Asia region such as Vietnam and Sri Lanka. The indigenous pig population is diminishing {{over the years and}} it requires a better attention for conservation and sustainable utilization. The objectives of this study were to identify the pig farming system characteristics and investigate the effect of these characteristics on <b>keeping</b> <b>pigs</b> for livelihood in Vietnam and Sri Lanka. A total of 725 households were surveyed including 264 <b>keeping</b> <b>pigs</b> and 461 without pigs. Farming system characteristics were analyzed by descriptive statistics. The effect of farming system characteristics on <b>keeping</b> <b>pigs</b> for livelihood was determined by logistic regression models (Models I and II). The results revealed that majority of famers (> 80 ) kept indigenous pigs as an income source in both countries. Free range pig rearing system with low cost feeding (mainly the kitchen waste) was predominant in Sri Lanka whereas confined pigs and providing commercial concentrates was mainly practiced in Vietnam. The average herd size was significantly (p< 0. 05) different in Vietnam (8) and in Sri Lanka (4). Age at first farrowing, farrowing intervals and number of piglets per farrow were higher in Vietnam than in Sri Lanka. The results of model-I showed that family size, availability of piped water, keeping other livestock than pigs, watering pigs adlibitum, positively influenced <b>keeping</b> <b>pigs</b> for home consumption, whereas feeding kitchen waste, availability of water connection in working condition and livestock income negatively influenced for the same attribute. The results of model-II revealed that availability of river water and livestock income have positive impacts while availability of piped water and watering pigs adlibitum have negative impacts on <b>keeping</b> <b>pigs</b> as a income source. These findings will be useful in formulating policies to conserve the gene pool of indigenous pigs and facilitate the indigenous pig production.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} investigate opportunities for improving pig farming systems both in {{urban and rural}} areas of Manokwari, Papua Barat province-Indonesia. The research started by assessing the perspectives and perceptions of farmers in group meetings. A number of 386 pigs in cummulative was weighing and measured for life body weights and body condition scores. Papuan pig farmers were represented by Jayapura, Biak, Ambai and Ansus(Serui), Mee(Nabire), Arfak(Manokwari) and Ayamaru(Sorong) tribes. Non-Papuan pig farmers identified with ethnic groups of Batak, Toraja, Manado and Flores. The highest numbers of pigs kept were by semi-penned pig farmers, followed by pen and restrained pig farmers. About two hours per day was devoted to work in the restrained, semi-penned and pen <b>pig</b> <b>keeping</b> systems, while less than 1. 5 hours per day was allocated by free-range pig farmers. In urban areas, feeding sources were kitchen and restaurant waste, and likewise crops and agriculture residues were in rural areas. Supplements and concentrates were used on a limited scale. Agricultural residues used were cassava, banana, taro, corn, grain and vegetable wastes. Litter sizes in the four pig farming systems were in average of 6 piglets/farrow/sow.

40|$|Abstract. Taenia solium causes human neurocysticercosis and is endemic in {{underdeveloped}} {{countries where}} backyard <b>pig</b> <b>keeping</b> is common. Microscopic fecal diagnostic methods for human T. solium taeniasis {{are not very}} sensitive, and Taenia saginata and Taenia solium eggs are indistinguishable under the light microscope. Coproantigen (CoAg) ELISA methods are very sensitive, but currently only genus (Taenia) specific. This paper describes {{the development of a}} highly species-specific coproantigen ELISA test to detect T. solium intestinal taeniasis. Sensitivity was maintained using a capture antibody of rabbit IgG against T. solium adult whole worm somatic extract, whereas species specificity was achieved by utilization of an enzyme-conjugated rabbit IgG against T. solium adult excretory-secretory (ES) antigen. A known panel of positive and negative human fecal samples was tested with this hybrid sandwich ELISA. The ELISA test gave 100 % specificity and 96. 4 % sensitivity for T. solium tapeworm carriers (N = 28), with a J index of 0. 96. This simple ELISA incorporating anti-adult somatic and anti-adult ES antibodies provides the first potentially species-specific coproantigen test for human T. solium taeniasis...|$|E

40|$|Pig {{production}} has increased {{significantly in the}} Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) region during the past decade, especially in rural, resource-poor, smallholder communities. Concurrent {{with the increase in}} smallholder <b>pig</b> <b>keeping</b> and pork consumption, there have been increasing reports of porcine cysticercosis in the ESA region. This article reviews the findings concerning the presence and impact of porcine cysticercosis in seven of the ESA countries. Most of the reported findings are based on surveys utilising lingual palpation and post-mortem examination, however, some also used serological assays. In Tanzania, community-based studies on porcine cysticercosis indicate a prevalence of 17. 4 % in the northern highlands district of Mbulu and a prevalence range of 5. 1 - 16. 9 % in the southern highlands. In Kenya recent surveys in the southwestern part of the country where smallholder <b>pig</b> <b>keeping</b> is popular indicate that 10 - 14 % of pigs are positive for cysticercosis by lingual examination. Uganda has the most pigs in Eastern Africa, most of which are kept under smallholder conditions. Preliminary surveys in 1998 and 1999 at slaughterhouses in Kampala indicated a prevalence of porcine cysticercosis between 0. 12 and 1. 2 %, however, a rural survey in northern Uganda in 1999 indicated 34 - 45 % of pigs slaughtered in selected villages were infected. Additionally, a new survey of 297 pigs slaughtered in Kampala in 2002 indicated that pigs from the central region of the country were negative for cysticercosis while 33. 7 % of the pigs coming from the rural Lira district in the north were positive. Interestingly 8 piglet foetuses removed from an infected slaughtered sow coming from Lira district were all found to harbour cysts of T. solium providing evidence of congenital transmission of porcine cysticercosis. In Mozambique, abattoir records indicate that porcine cysticercosis is present in all provinces of the country. A serological survey on pigs in rural Tete Province found 15 % of pigs positive. In Zimbabwe, a retrospective study in official abattoirs around the country from 1994 to 2001 reported a mean prevalence of 0. 34 % which is in contrast to a post-mortem survey in 1999, which showed that the prevalence of porcine cysticercosis in rural west Zimbabwe where smallholder <b>pig</b> <b>keeping</b> is popular was 28. 6 %. In Zambia, abattoir records reported porcine cysticercosis in six of the nine provinces. Routine meat inspection of 1316 pigs at a slaughter slab in Lusaka showed that 20. 6 % of the pigs had cysticercosis whereas serological testing of 874 pigs at the same abattoir indicated that 56. 6 % were found to have circulating antigens of Taenia solium. Field surveys based on lingual palpation in Southern and Eastern Provinces of Zambia revealed prevalences of 8. 2 - 28. 4 and 5. 2 %, respectively. South Africa has the largest number of pigs in Southern Africa and cysticercosis has been recognised as a problem in the country for many decades. There is strong evidence supporting the high prevalence of neurocysticercosis infecting humans from resource-poor areas of the country where pigs are being raised under smallholder conditions. In spite of this community-based surveys on porcine cysticercosis have never been conducted in South Africa and the last slaughterhouse survey was conducted nearly 40 years ago. The prevalences of porcine cysticercosis found in these ESA countries rank {{among the highest in the}} world and the disease is emerging as an important constraint for the nutritional and economic well being of resource-poor smallholder farming communities. The current findings suggest the widespread presence of human tapeworm carriers and thus a high risk of human cysticercosis in both rural areas and urban centres in the ESA region. More research is required in the region to assess the extent and public health and economic impact of T. solium infection in order to determine whether and what prevention and control efforts are needed...|$|E

60|$|The {{last point}} worth notice {{is that we}} have unusually good {{evidence}} of breeds of <b>pigs</b> now <b>keeping</b> perfectly true, which have been formed by the crossing of several distinct breeds. The Improved Essex pigs, for instance, breed very true; but {{there is no doubt that}} they largely owe their present excellent qualities to crosses originally made by Lord Western with the Neapolitan race, and to subsequent crosses with the Berkshire breed (this also having been improved by Neapolitan crosses), and likewise, probably, with the Sussex breed. (3/30. S. Sidney's edition of 'Youatt on the Pig' 1860 pages 7, 26, 27, 29, 30.) In breeds thus formed by complex crosses, the most careful and unremitting selection during many generations has been found to be indispensable. Chiefly in consequence of so much crossing, some well-known breeds have undergone rapid changes; thus, according to Nathusius (3/31. 'Schweineschadel' s 140.), the Berkshire breed of 1780 is quite different from that of 1810; and, since this latter period, at least two distinct forms have borne the same name.|$|R
