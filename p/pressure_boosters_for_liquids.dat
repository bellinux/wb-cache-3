40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{increase}} energy efficiency of a pneumatic system the compressed air discharged from pneumatic actuator is being collected. In those conditions, the air contains {{a certain amount of}} energy and can be used at the points that require a lower level of pressure for their operations. If the collected air can not be directly returned and used in a pneumatic system, then the air pressure is increased by using pressure intensifier which is known in the commercial use as pneumatic <b>booster.</b> <b>For</b> that operation, the booster uses and consumes a part of the collected air. In this paper we analyze the dynamic behavior of a <b>pressure</b> <b>booster</b> and calculate its energy efficiency by using mathematical modeling and simulation in Simulink. The model of one pneumatic booster and its energy efficiency is verified by conducted experimental testing...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} of heating and {{domestic hot water}} is very high and will keep increasing. Air source absorption heat pump (ASAHP) was proposed to overcome the problems of low energy efficiency and high air pollution existing in boiler systems, {{as well as the}} problem of bad performance under low ambient temperatures for electrical heat pumps. In order to investigate the crystallization possibility of ammonia-salt ASAHP, crystallization margin (evaluated by solution mass concentration) at generating temperature ranging from 100 to 150 °C, evaporating temperature from − 30 to 10 °C, and condensing temperature from 30 to 65 °C are analyzed. To prevent the NH 3 –NaSCN solution from crystallizing, ASAHP integrated with <b>pressure</b> <b>booster</b> located between the evaporator and absorber is simulated. Analysis and comparisons show that NH 3 –NaSCN is easy to crystallize at relatively high generating temperature, low evaporating temperature, and low condensing temperature. But crystallization margin of NH 3 –LiNO 3 can always stay above 5 % for most conditions, keeping away from crystallization. <b>Pressure</b> <b>booster</b> can effectively avoid the crystallization problem that will take place in the NH 3 –NaSCN ASAHP system...|$|R
