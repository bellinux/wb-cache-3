40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for discovering directed intention-driven <b>pedestrian</b> <b>activities</b> across large urban areas. The proposed approach {{is based on a}} mutual information co-clustering technique that simultaneously clusters trajectory start locations in the scene which have similar distributions across stop locations and vice-versa. The clustering assignments are obtained by minimizing the loss of mutual information between a trajectory start-stop association matrix and a compressed co-clustered matrix, after which the scene activities are inferred from the compressed matrix. We demonstrate our approach using a dataset of long duration trajectories from multiple PTZ cameras covering a large area and show improved results over two other popular trajectory clustering and entry-exit learning approaches. 1...|$|R

In this paper we model the normal behaviours of pedestrian flows and detect anomalous events from pedestrian counting data of the City of Melbourne. Since the data spans an extended period, and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>activities</b> can change intermittently (e. g., activities in winter vs. summer), we applied an Ensemble Switching Model, which is a dynamic anomaly detection technique that can accommodate systems that switch between different states. The results are compared with those produced by a static clustering model (Hy-CARCE) and also cross-validated with known events. We found that the results from the Ensemble Switching Model are valid and more accurate than HyCARCE...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{wind tunnel}} {{measurement}} {{study on the}} pedestrian level (1. 5 m to 2 m height from the ground) wind environment was carried out and applied to a case measurement of JinYing high-rise building of a height of 86. 8 m in Taipei, Taiwan. Wind tunnel measurements incorporating with statistical analysis of in-situ recorded wind data were applied to asses the wind environment of pedestrian level wind comfort and safety due to the JinYing building project. Long term in-situ recorded wind data in the nearby of the high-rise building site was collected and analyzed. The Weibull probability distribution was found to fit better for the wind speed data. For each location around the JinYin building, we integrated the measured wind tunnel pedestrian level peak wind speed and Weibull probability distribution of the wind speed to yield the results for assessing the pedestrian level wind comfort and safety around the building. Based on the pedestrian level wind acceptability criteria proposed by the RWDI company in Canada, it is concluded the comfort and safety of <b>pedestrian</b> level <b>activities</b> are acceptable of the JinYing high rise building project. Also the present study offered an example for assessing how the high-rise building project affects the local wind environment experienced by <b>pedestrian</b> <b>activities</b> both to ensure comfort or safety and to facilitate the attractiveness of the building project...|$|R
50|$|Although hyperlordosis {{gives an}} {{impression}} of a stronger back, incongruently {{it can lead to}} moderate to severe lower back pain. The most problematic symptom is that of herniated disc where the dancer has put so much strain on their back that the discs between the vertebrae have been damaged or have ruptured. Technical problems with dancing such as difficulty in the positions of attitude and arabesque can be a sign of weak iliopsoas. Tightness of the iliopsoas results in a dancer having difficulty lifting their leg into high positions. Abdominal muscles being weak and the rectus femoris of the quadriceps being tight are signs that improper muscles are being worked while dancing which leads to lumbar hyperlordosis. The most obvious signs of lumbar hyperlordosis is lower back pain in dancing and <b>pedestrian</b> <b>activities</b> as well as having the appearance of a swayed back.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a novel method {{to determine the}} model order of a stochastic model for moving objects. The main assumption is that we {{make use of the}} knowledge that the obtained model is going to be used for some task, specifically, for trajectory classification. Particularly, the object motion is described by trajectories performed by the objects (e. g., pedestrians), during their motion, by representing them by a small and meaningful mixtures of vector fields. We present a discriminative method for model selection without resort to computationally expensive cross-validation procedures. The idea is, thus, to select the generative model achieving the best classification performance. Although the topic of application is video surveillance, the proposed method can easily be extended to other practical situations. Experiments with both synthetic and real data concerning <b>pedestrian</b> <b>activities</b> illustrate the performance of the proposed approach. 1...|$|R

40|$|Over the years, {{different}} modelling {{approaches to}} simulating pedestrian movement have been suggested. The majority of pedestrian decision models {{are based on}} the concept of utility maximization. To explore alternatives, we developed the heterogeneous heuristic model (HHM), based on principles of bounded rationality, which can be used to estimate different decision heuristics applied in a decision. This paper reports a validation work aimed at testing the predictive ability of a pedestrian model system, composed of four decision models, go-home, direction choice, rest, and store patronage decision, that were estimated based on HHM using pedestrian shopping diary data collected in a Chinese shopping street. A dedicated multi-agent siniulation platform was developed using NetLogo for simulating pedestrian behaviour. Aggregate spatio-temporal distributions of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>activities</b> are compared with observations. The model system shows good predictive ability in general, however, with some under- and overestimations. Possible reasons are discussed...|$|R

In addition, I extend the concerns of event-based performance into the lexicon of landscape architecture by acknowledging Lawrence Halprin's role in the workshop as the architect of the deck and marital collaboration with Halprin.

40|$|Many urban {{studies have}} been done to {{demonstrate}} that urban sprawl is not the right approach in hot climate cities. On the contrary, a compact design is recommended to enhance human thermal comfort. This research aims to clarify the relation between urban morphology and outdoor thermal comfort of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The aim is to develop an outstanding future strategic compact morphology that would facilitate a dynamic development of the city. Jeddah city will soon have a subway that is expected to radically change the habits of its inhabitants. Our idea is to consider the main stations of the future metro as nodes, creating more densely inhabited localities and also defining transitional spaces for <b>pedestrian</b> <b>activities.</b> Microclimates generated in and around these activity nodes must be particularly studied to encourage residents and visitors to reclaim a pedestrian life that was clearly noticeable in the old city, but has virtually disappeared in most recent neighborhoods, entirely devoted to automobile transport.

Challenges faced by local authorities in providing facilities that are suitable for each group of pedestrians due to lack of information on the pedestrian profile’s pattern. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to assess on the pedestrian profile pattern in one of the Central business district within Kuala Lumpur City Center that are among the highest pedestrian volume and adequate pedestrian facilities. On-street questionnaire survey was conducted first in order to ensure that the existing pedestrian facilities of the selected area were between acceptable to good quality range. The parameters includes are overall travel experience, sidewalk condition, aesthetic and amenities, crossings, street furniture, personal safety and adjacent traffic. Then, Pedestrian classification counts were carried out on afternoon peak-hour for one whole week. From the result, similar pedestrian profile pattern were observed on Monday to Thursday and the number of trips made increased on weekends for both count location. The result also shows that female pedestrian, especially in the 18 to 34 age range made the highest number of trips. In overall, the female pedestrian used the existing pedestrian facilities more than male for every group profile except for elderly person with disabilities/with prams...|$|R
