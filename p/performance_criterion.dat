40|$|Modeling a Coriolis mass-flow meter for shape {{optimization}} is considered. The optimization should en-hance {{the performance}} of the meter by improving several <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> like the measurement sensi-tivity. These <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> are improved by optimizing parameters that define the shape of the tube in the mass-flow meter. A dynamic model is used to obtain the <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> for a set of shape parame-ters. The tube is modeled using a flexible multibody approach, where an existing beam-element is modified to include the effect of the fluid flow. Besides the calculation of the <b>performance</b> <b>criteria,</b> the model is used to calculate the sensitivities of the <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> to the shape parameters, because those sensitivities are useful for the optimization.

40|$|<b>Performance</b> <b>criteria</b> {{typically}} {{reflect the}} values of the project stakeholders in how they will be viewing their projects. A critical analysis of current research shows that several key challenges being faced in information systems (IS) projects include the lack of clearly defined objectives, mismatched stakeholders' expectations and lack of sufficient or formal methods to aid practitioners in developing relevant <b>performance</b> <b>criteria.</b> This is accentuated by growing calls to rethink the traditional measurement paradigm. Moreover, most of the known solutions in practice are without structured or easily implementable procedures to elicit and develop <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> and measures. Against this background, the paper proposes a formal method to develop a comprehensive set of <b>performance</b> <b>criteria</b> or objectives grounded in the views of the project stakeholders and associated measures aligned to these objectives.

They posit the reason for this was that their predictors shared a common source with the job attitudes and role perception criterion measures, but not with the employee <b>performance</b> <b>criterion</b> measures.

5000|$|Both {{open-loop}} and closed-loop {{models of}} optimal control have been studied; the former generally ignores {{the role of}} sensory feedback, while the latter attempts to incorporate sensory feedback, which includes delays and uncertainty associated with the sensory systems involved in movement. Open-loop models are simpler but have severe limitations—they model a movement as prerecorded in the nervous system, ignoring sensory feedback, and also fail to model variability between movements with the same task-goal. In both models, the primary difficulty is identifying the cost associated with a movement.

5000|$|This {{methodology}} {{was introduced}} by Robert Solow in 1957. Growth accounting was proposed for management accounting in the 1980s [...] {{but they did not}} gain on as management tools. The reason is clear. The production functions are understood and formulated differently in growth accounting and management accounting. In growth accounting the production function is formulated as a function OUTPUT=F (INPUT), which formulation leads to maximize the average productivity ratio OUTPUT/INPUT. Average productivity has never been accepted in management accounting (in business) as a <b>performance</b> <b>criterion</b> or an objective to be maximized because it would mean the end of the profitable business. Instead the production function is formulated as a function INCOME=F(OUTPUT-INPUT) which is to be maximized. The name of the game is to maximize income, not to maximize productivity or production.|$|E

In fact, one structured interview that included a) a predetermined set of questions that interviewers were able to choose from, and b) interviewer scoring of applicant answers after each individual question using previously created benchmark answers, showed validity levels comparable to cognitive ability tests (traditionally {{one of the best}} predictors of job performance) for entry level jobs.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, {{researchers}} {{have considered the}} effects of individual personality traits on team dynamics and performance {{to be an important}} team factor. [...] The Big Five personality traits include extraversion (positive emotions, sociability and warmth), conscientiousness (competence order and self-discipline), agreeableness (trust, straightforwardness), openness to experience (new ideas, experiences and imagining), and neuroticism (anxiety, self-consciousness and sensibility). The last decade has witnessed renewed interest in personality that has been extended to teams as researchers have examined the impact of team personality composition on team effectiveness. In general, this research has found a link between aggregate team member personality and team performance. However, most of these studies have been conducted in laboratory settings using creativity as the <b>performance</b> <b>criterion,</b> meaning that they are disjunctive rather than additive tasks. [...] Relatively little has been done to understand the relationship of personality to the performance of actual work teams completing production tasks that are additive. [...] Another reason for the lack of cumulative knowledge in relating personality to actual work-team outcomes has been the lack of a generally accepted taxonomy of personality. [...] Consistent with individual-level research, team-level conscientiousness appears to be a fairly potent positive predictor of team effectiveness. Although conscientiousness has been most frequently studied, some research suggests that other Big Five personality factors, such as extraversion and agreeableness may also play a role in determining work team effectiveness. The recent emergence of the five-factor model (FFM) as a robust taxonomy of personality provides a comprehensive framework from which to examine personality and its relationship to both individual and team performance. It is evident that individual personality traits affect the team's processes and outcomes. Empirical support has shown the following: the presence of extraversion in team members leads to increased team viability and communication; the presence of conscientiousness leads to an increase in overall performance; the presence of agreeableness in team members leads to an increase in cohesion, communication, productivity, and overall performance; the presence of openness to experience in team members leads to an increase in communication; the presence of neuroticism in team members leads to an increase in cohesion and overall performance.|$|E
