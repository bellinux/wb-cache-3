40|$|Abstract A “low-balling {{strategy}} ” by bidding contractors {{has increasingly}} {{been recognized as}} an important issue in public infrastructure procurement. Public works contracts are often imperfect and renegotiated after the contract award. Given the expectation for ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustments,</b> bidders seem motivated {{to take advantage of}} the low-balling strategy. This paper analyzes the endogeneity between the bid strategy and ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Using procurement data on rural road projects in Nepal, it shows that the bid strategy and adjustments are determined endogenously in the system. Anticipating cost and time overruns, firms would likely undercut normal bid prices. Then, ex <b>post</b> contract <b>adjustments</b> actually happen, because of their too aggressive bids. ...|$|R

For example, ICSC calculated that U.

The comparisons can be based on direct implementation-costs or the extent to which desirable adjustments are not implemented.

If the latter game form is defined as an employment relationship, the theory of the firm becomes a special case of the program. The article starts with a discussion of the nature and magnitude of adjustment-costs, followed by an exposition of four examples.

40|$|Auditor-Client {{negotiation}} about difficult client {{accounting issues}} involves the auditor, the client, {{and various other}} parties on both the client and auditor side. On the auditor side, the Professional Practice Department {{has been reported to}} {{play a significant role in}} the financial reporting process, yet is rarely the focus of academic study. In this study, I investigate how communicating the involvement of the Professional Practice Department (PPD) to top management using different influence techniques impacts negotiated outcomes between audit partners and top management. I examine the impact of communicating the involvement of the PPD in the context of two other variables found in prior auditing literature to be important in the negotiation process, auditor type and CFO (Chief Financial Officer) preferred auditor-type. While auditors must attest that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, they also must ensure they foster a functional working relationship with the client. The auditor-client context is unique, and takes place within an on-going relationship where expectations and preferences have been established. Therefore, I examine these negotiation outcomes while incorporating a key contextual variable, auditor-type, in the negotiations. Both the CFO's preference for auditor-type, as well as actual auditor-type will be examined in addition to the specific influence tactic. I use a 3 x 2 x 2 fully factorial design to experimentally analyze the impact of two manipulated variable (influence tactic and auditor-type) and one measured variable (CFO preference for auditor-type) on two dependent variables. The two dependent variables are the CFO's willingness to <b>post</b> an <b>adjustment</b> to the financial statements and the CFO's satisfaction with the audit partner. I report the results of an audit negotiation experiment in which 154 highly experienced CFOs responded to a case scenario that incorporated or measured the three key variables (influence tactic communicating PPD involvement, auditor-type and CFO preference for auditor type). My results indicate that using the most aggressive influence tactic to communicate the Professional Practice Department's involvement had a mixed effect on the CFOs willingness to <b>post</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the financial statements. The CFOs in this influence condition that were paired with an accommodating auditor-type reported a higher willingness to adjust the financial statements while CFOs paired with a proactive and advising auditor-type reported a lower willingness to <b>post</b> <b>adjustments.</b> All CFOs reported less satisfaction with the audit partner when the most aggressive influence tactic was used to communicate the Professional Practice Department's inyolvement. Furthermore, the CFO's preference for an auditor-type significantly affects negotiation outcomes. CFOs that prefer more proactive and advising audit partners are more likely to <b>post</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the financial statements, regardless of whether or not. they are informed of the Professional Practice Department's involvement. These same CFOs report a high level of satisfaction with the audit partner and their satisfaction is not impacted by the type of audit partner they are paired with. CFOs that prefer more reactive and accommodating audit partners are less willing to adjust the financial statements and report less satisfaction (dissatisfaction), when paired with proactive and advising audit partners. These results highlight the importance of the existing relationship within the auditor-client dyads and help support findings from auditor-client negotiation research which show that prevailing expectations of the CFO are a contextually important feature of audit negotiation and should be incorporated into more research. I also show that aggressive tactics can help persuade some CFOs to adjust the financial statements; however, consistently pushing too aggressively results in reduced cooperation. Furthermore, there are large costs in terms of the CFO's satisfaction with the audit partner in using aggressive tactics, and therefore, practically speaking the tactic that could potentially be the most effective may result in a lost client...|$|R

Growth that increases inequality may not reduce poverty; growth that does not change inequality (distribution-neutral growth) and growth that reduces inequality (pro-poor growth) result in poverty reduction. Policy makers can promote pro-poor growth by empowering the poor to participate in growth directly. Policy makers can focus on interventions that improve productivity in smallholder agriculture, particularly export crops, increasing employment of semi-skilled or unskilled labour, promoting technology adoption, increasing access to production assets, as well as effective participation in input and product markets.

40|$|The paper readdresses the post-award {{adjustment}} {{problem in}} infrastructure procurement. Cost overruns and project delays {{have long been}} chronic difficulties in implementing infrastructure projects. Too many ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustments</b> not only incur significant adaptation costs to contractors but also undermine efficiency, credibility and predictability of the budget execution. The paper analyzes the case of public road procurement in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is found that if large post-award amendments are anticipated, bidders are likely to reflect them to their bids systematically. Under the perfect foresight assumption, one dollar of anticipated contract adjustment would decrease the bid strategy by 7 cents; the effect seems to be offset largely by the incurred adaptation cost to contractors, which is estimated at 93 cents per one dollar of contract adjustment. Therefore, the ex post adaptation approach is much costly, {{and it may be}} better to formulate the accurate budget on a more solid basis and use the agreed contract as high-powered incentives to contractors.

Empirical results on two samples of US and EU stocks show that the 'fundamental' earning price ratio (E/P) explains a significant share of cross-sectional variation of the observed E/P, this impact being stronger in the US market. It is also found that: (i) the fundamental component of the E/P has superior explanatory power than simpler measures of expected earnings growth; (ii) 'non-fundamental' components, interpreted as signals reducing asymmetric information (such as firm size, the number of forecasts and the chartist momentum), mitigate {{the role of the}} fundamentals; (iii) current deviations from the fundamentals are affected by ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustment</b> of publicly available information in the EU sample.

Empirical analyses of integration processes however require an extensively harmonized procedure to compile and disseminate FDI data. This paper focuses on the question whether {{and to what extent}} a comparability of FDI data can be taken for granted. In the recent past, comparability of FDI data has improved a lot: According to IMF surveys in 2001 and 1997, the Applicant Countries (ACs) in particular were rather successful in complying with the international standards. However, a lot of problems remain, especially concerning the inclusion of indirectly owned {{direct investment}} enterprises, the comprehensive coverage of FDI components, the reporting of reverse investment and the measurement of stock data. For certain established EU countries the problem of international holding companies causes further complications. Moreover, harmonization in recent years does not necessarily mean respective ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustments.</b> So international comparisons should focus on the very recent years of more successful harmonization and always keep in mind, that deviations might, to a high extent, be due to statistical and methodological reasons.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{framework}} in which the effect of divorce in late life could be examined. Statistics indicate a growing number of persons who occupy the divorce status in late life. Many of these persons enter late life in the divorced status, others are divorced after age 60. This study focuses upon those who divorce after age 60. Although previous work does not shed much light upon late life divorce, it yields a clear picture of the characteristics, process and consequences of divorce for younger persons. Assumptions derived from work with younger divorcing populations provide a basis for the conceptual framework used in this study. A description of who gets divorced, causes, process and consequences of divorce in late life is provided. A model which predicts <b>post</b> divorce <b>adjustment</b> also is tested. Findings affirm similarities between younger and older divorcing persons. Persons divorcing in late life generally were urban residing, had low occupational status, few assets, weak religious and kinship ties. Generally, in this study divorce resulted from a long-standing lack of emotional gratification aggravated by some type of precipitating event. Few subjects perceived themselves to be victims of the divorce; most had ambivalent feelings about getting divorced and mixed experiences during the divorce. The legal, economic, social and psychological consequences are greater for those who resisted the divorce. Those subjects also were less successful in resolving problems and exhibited higher levels of stress subsequent to the divorce. A curvilinear relationship between age and <b>post</b> divorce <b>adjustment</b> was found. Those in mid life (45 - 65) were affected more adversely than those in later life. Sex, consequences and type of divorce experienced accounted for 49 per cent of the differences found in <b>post</b> divorce <b>adjustment.</b> Overall, the data suggest that: (1) females have more negative divorce experiences and suffer greater negative consequences than do males; (2) managed conflict is an important part of successful adjustment; and (3) society does not recognize the complications presented by late life divorce...|$|R

Antipsychotics have become a mainstay treatment and are often not {{used in conjunction with}} concomitant psychotherapy, education, family psychoeducation, or social service interventions.

40|$|The econometric {{literature}} of high frequency data usually relies on moment estimators which {{are derived from}} assuming local constancy of volatility and related quantities. We here show that this first order approximation is not always valid if used naïvely. We find that such approximations require an ex <b>post</b> <b>adjustment</b> involving asymptotic likelihood ratios. These are given. Several examples (powers of volatility, leverage effect, ANOVA) are provided. The first order approximations in this study can be over the period of one observation, or over blocks of successive observations. The theory relies heavily on the interplay between stable convergence and measure change, and on asymptotic expansions for martingales. Practically, the procedure permits (1) the definition of estimators of hard to reach quantities, such as the leverage effect, (2) the improvement in efficiency in classical estimators, and (3) easy analysis. More conceptually, we show that the approximation induces a measure change similar to that occurring in options pricing theory. In particular, localization over one observation induces a measure change related to the leverage effect, while localization over a block of observations creates an effect that connects to the volatility of volatility. Another conceptual gain is the relationship to Hermite polynomials. The three measure changes mentioned relate, respectively, to the first, third, and second such polynomial...|$|R
