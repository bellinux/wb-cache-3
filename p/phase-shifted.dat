5|$|When {{the power}} company's voltage becomes {{distorted}} due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This condition {{may lead to}} overheating and shorter operating life. Also, substation transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively. In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load {{may be required to}} install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple <b>phase-shifted</b> windings.|$|E

However the <b>phase-shifting</b> error will influence inevitably the evaluation precision in practice operation. In this paper, the deformation evaluation errors by means of two kinds of four-step <b>phase-shifting</b> algorithms, which are in common use in digital holography, are analyzed and compared by computer simulation. In addition, the <b>phase-shifting</b> errors may cumulate or not according to different <b>phase-shifting</b> techniques, and both cases are considered in this paper. The results based on the digital in-line holography show that the two four-step <b>phase-shifting</b> algorithms possess different sensitivity to the <b>phase-shifting</b> errors, and the preferable one, which is more immune to the <b>phase-shifting</b> errors, is educed in conclusion. ...|$|R

In <b>phase-shifting</b> method, it is often used four steps of <b>phase-shifting</b> for one cycle.

2500|$|A second, {{and perhaps}} more correct, {{definition}} of [...] "compatible single sideband" [...] (CSSB) refers {{to a form of}} amplitude and phase modulation in which the carrier is transmitted along with a series of sidebands that are predominantly above or below the carrier term. [...] Since phase modulation is present in the generation of the signal, energy is removed from the carrier term and redistributed into the sideband structure similar to that which occurs in analog frequency modulation. [...] The signals feeding the phase modulator and the envelope modulator are further <b>phase-shifted</b> by 90° with respect to each other. [...] This places the information terms in quadrature with each other; the Hilbert transform of information to be transmitted is utilized to cause constructive addition of one sideband and cancellation of the opposite primary sideband. [...] Since phase modulation is employed, higher-order terms are also generated. [...] Several methods have been employed to reduce the impact (amplitude) of most of these higher-order terms. [...] In one system, the phase-modulated term is actually the log {{of the value of the}} carrier level plus the <b>phase-shifted</b> audio/information term. [...] This produces an ideal CSSB signal, where at low modulation levels only a first-order term on one side of the carrier is predominant. [...] As the modulation level is increased, the carrier level is reduced while a second-order term increases substantially in amplitude. [...] At the point of 100% envelope modulation, 6dB of power is removed from the carrier term, and the second-order term is identical in amplitude to carrier term. [...] The first-order sideband has increased in level until it is now at the same level as the formerly unmodulated carrier. [...] At the point of 100% modulation, the spectrum appears identical to a normal double-sideband AM transmission, with the center term (now the primary audio term) at a 0dB reference level, and both terms on either side of the primary sideband at −6dB. [...] The difference is that what appears to be the carrier has shifted by the audio-frequency term towards the [...] "sideband in use". [...] At levels below 100% modulation, the sideband structure appears quite asymmetric. [...] When voice is conveyed by a CSSB source of this type, low-frequency components are dominant, while higher-frequency terms are lower by as much as 20dB at 3kHz. [...] The result is that the signal occupies approximately 1/2 the normal bandwidth of a full-carrier, DSB signal. [...] There is one catch: the audio term utilized to phase-modulate the carrier is generated based on a log function that is biased by the carrier level. [...] At negative 100% modulation, the term is driven to zero (0), and the modulator becomes undefined. [...] Strict modulation control must be employed to maintain stability of the system and avoid splatter. [...] This system is of Russian origin and was described in the late 1950s. [...] It is uncertain whether it was ever deployed.|$|E
