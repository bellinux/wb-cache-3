500|$|Georgia Tech {{professor}} and Persuasive Games CEO Ian Bogost defended {{the use of}} Manchester Cathedral in the game. He described Sony's apology as [...] "self-defeating" [...] and criticised Sony and Insomniac Games for not explaining their goals {{with the use of}} the cathedral. He wrote that the cathedral was [...] "one of the only significant experiences in the whole game", where he otherwise described it as [...] "not a game richly imbued with wisdom." [...] He wrote that video games provided players with a way to experience war time situations and called the use of the cathedral [...] "the most powerful of these moments" [...] and the [...] "subtlest" [...] in Resistance. He argued that the use of an accurate depiction of the monument instead of an anonymous location encourages players to <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> as a structure that [...] "demands respect." [...] He wrote that Resistance [...] "adds a fictional homage to the church’s resolve".|$|E
2500|$|In 1920 a {{department}} {{was set up}} in Poland by Florian Znaniecki (1882–1958). William I. Thomas was an early graduate from the Sociology Department of the University of Chicago. He built upon his education and his work changed sociology in many ways. In 1918, William I. Thomas and Florian Znaniecki gave the world the publication of [...] "The Polish Peasant" [...] in Europe and America. This publication combined sociological theory with in depth experiential research and thus launching methodical sociological research as a whole. This changed sociologist’s methods and enabled them to see new patterns and connect new theories. This publication also gave sociologists a new way to found their research and prove it on a new level. All their research would be more solid, and harder for society to not <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> In 1920, Znaniecki developed a sociology department in Poland to expand research and teachings there.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 May 2009, Emina's third studio album Vila (Fairy) was {{released}} through PGP RTS. She dedicated this album to her late grandfather, Adam. The album {{was recorded in}} two years and included songs written and composed by Jahović, except [...] "Ne zaboravi", a song by Aleksandra Milutinović who also worked on Emina's previous albums and [...] "Zver" [...] which was co-written and co-produced by Dino Merlin. The track [...] "Ne zaboravi" [...] featured a back-up vocal by the famous Turkish pop singer İzel. On the album, {{there is also a}} duet with Dino Merlin, [...] "Med", which is known as the only song Merlin ever sang that he had not written by himself. The song also won the award for Best Song in the Balkans from Bosnia and Herzegovina for 2009 at the 1st Balkan Music Awards in which Emina was also nominated for Best Female Performer in the Balkans 2009 whereas her song [...] "Pile moje" [...] was among the nominees for Best Song in the Balkans from Republic of Serbia for 2009. It is also mentioned by Emina that the reason why she chooses the name Vila for the album is because she thinks {{it is one of the}} best songs she has ever written and that is why she wants people to <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

60|$|At {{the time}} of which we write, (about sixty years ago), Algiers was under the {{dominion}} of Turkey, but exercised all the rights of an independent state. It may {{be described as a}} monstrous blot of barbarism hanging on the skirts of civilisation. It was an anomaly too, for it claimed to be an orthodox power, and was recognised as such by the nations of Europe, while in reality its chief power consisted in consummate impudence, founded on pride and ignorance of the strength of other powers, coupled with the peculiarity of its position and {{with the fact that the}} great nations were too much engaged fighting with each other to be at leisure to <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Its rulers or Deys were most of them ignorant men, who had risen, in many cases, from the ranks of the janissaries or common Turkish soldiery, and its sole occupation was piracy--piracy pure and simple.|$|E
60|$|With that Susan left me, without {{offering}} any {{assistance in}} making out {{a list of}} china. This was a terrible story; but, after all, it was founded only upon servants' gossip. In this country, even proud, rich men like Mr. Havelot did not have such absurd ideas regarding the source of wealth. Money is money, and whether it {{is derived from the}} ordinary products of the earth, from which came much of Mr. Havelot's revenue, or from an extraordinary project such as my glacier spur, it truly could not matter so far as concerned the standing in society of its possessor. What utter absurdity was this which Susan had told me! If I were to go to Mr. Havelot and tell him that I would not marry his daughter because he supplied brewers and bakers with the products of his fields, would he not consider me an idiot? I determined to pay no attention to the idle tale. But alas! determinations of that sort are often of little avail. I did <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> and my spirits drooped.|$|E
6000|$|While thus engaged he was watched, {{apparently}} {{with deep}} interest, {{by a small}} crab, a shrimp, and several little fish of various kinds, all of which we may add, seemed to have various degrees of curiosity. One particular little fish, named a goby, and celebrated for its wide-awake nature and impudence, actually came to the front-glass of the helmet and looked in. But the diver {{was too busy to}} <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Nothing abashed, the goby went to each of the side-windows, but, receiving no encouragement, it made for a convenient ledge of the rock, where, resting its fore-fins on a barnacle, it turned its head a little on one side and looked on in silence. Finding this rather tedious, after a time it went, with much of the spirit of a London street-boy, and, passing close to the shrimp, tweaked the end of one of its feelers, causing that volatile creature to vanish. It then made a demonstration of attack on the crab, but that crustaceous worthy, sitting up on its hind-legs and expanding both claws with a very [...] "come-on-if-you-dare" [...] aspect, bid it defiance.|$|E
5000|$|As {{more people}} have moved from {{consuming}} news through traditional outlets—such as newspapers and broadcast news—, the barely surviving traditional news entities have aimed at transforming their reporting process {{to respond to the}} desires and needs of the 21st Century news consumers.

50|$|When an {{individual}} encounters a novel environmental stimulus, {{such as a}} bright flash of light or a sudden loud noise, {{he or she will}} <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> even before identifying it.

50|$|Many {{points of}} the Federal Pact were never followed; though it is {{mentioned}} by the 1853 constitution {{as one of the}} pre-existent pacts, it was not in effect during the Rosas hegemony who insisted in the inadequacy of a premature constitution.

Rosas seamed to completely ignore the petition, but other federal caudillos, in special Justo José de Urquiza, would <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

50|$|Researchers report social anxiety {{as having}} two {{significant}} components: fear of negative evaluation and social avoidance. It {{has been suggested}} that people with a fear of negative evaluation {{are more likely to be}} inﬂuenced by their peers, while those with a tendency for social avoidance are less likely to be influenced by their peers. The individuals concerned with negative evaluation are more likely to comply, as disagreeing with their peers is seen as having a higher cost than the cost of being wrong. Individuals with high levels of social avoidance, on the other hand, place less value on the information provided by others, and are less likely to <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> resulting in a lower level of conformity.|$|E

30|$|Before, we {{describe}} our model, <b>it</b> is needed <b>to</b> clarify {{the difference between}} attention and awareness. This work considers awareness as the main ingredient of attention.

Fortunately, this classification supports the agent types, we defined earlier for this work. This work considers a social agent that is always attentive and a regular agent that is possibly aware of a situation. However, for model specifications, the difference between awareness and attention has no significance (and can be used interchangeably), as attention just adds action to awareness which is embedded in description of the agents.|$|R
