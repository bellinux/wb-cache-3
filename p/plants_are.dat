40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} Cereal Crops Research Institute Pirsabak Nowshera during 2002 - 03 on six wheat cultivars/advance lines to identify the best suitable time of planting in the central agro-ecological zone of NWFP. Randomized complete block design was used with 3 replications. Six <b>planting</b> dates <b>were</b> used from October 25 th to December 15 th with 10 days increment. Data were recorded on Days to 50 % heading, Days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. Maximum number of days (132) to 50 % heading <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th Minimum number of days (114) <b>were</b> reported when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on December, 15 th. Maximum number of days (178) to maturity <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th. Number of days to maturity decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum number of days (130) <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed till 15 th of December. Highest plant height (98 cm) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on October 25 th and November 05 th. Plant Height decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed. Minimum <b>Plant</b> height (85 cm) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed till 15 th of December. Maximum grain yield (3937 kg ha - 1) <b>was</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on November 05 th. Grain yield decreased as <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> delayed with 10 days increment. Minimum grain yield (2274 kg ha - 1) <b>was</b> observed when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on 15 th of December. A negative correlation <b>was</b> recorded between <b>planting</b> dates and days to 50 % heading, days to maturity, Plant height and Grain yield. The yield losses due to late <b>planting</b> recorded <b>were</b> 8 % when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on November 15 th, 22 % loss when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on 25 th November, 34 % losses <b>were</b> incurred when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> done on December 5 th and 42 % losses <b>were</b> recorded when <b>planting</b> <b>was</b> further delayed till December 15 th. Hence it is concluded that {{first two weeks of}} November is the best time for obtaining higher yields from the recommended cultivars...|$|R

5|$|Variety in texture, {{height and}} timing of floral display were equally {{important}} horticultural considerations. The beds around each headstone are planted {{with a mixture of}} floribunda roses and herbaceous perennials. Low-growing <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones, ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain. In cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers, dwarf varieties of <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> used instead.|$|E

5|$|Banksia violacea {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of Banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous populations. In both cases, <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> adapted to release their aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground; however the possession of a lignotuber makes plants much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration, as maternal <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> not killed by bushfire, but resprout from below ground level. Lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north-eastern populations, in the vicinity of Woodanilling. An investigation into the biogeography of these plants failed to find any vegetative, climatic or other environmental factors associated with the possession of a lignotuber.|$|E
5|$|Both {{plant and}} animal life endemic to snow-bound areas develop ways to adapt. Among the {{adaptive}} mechanisms for <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and for animals are hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{compound}} {{leaves of}} flowering <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> partially homologous both to leaves and shoots, because their development {{has evolved from}} a genetic mosaic of leaf and shoot development.|$|E

40|$|Kavirajes or {{traditional}} medicinal practitioners form the primary healthcare providers of the predominantly rural population of Bangladesh. Kavirajes {{use a variety}} of medicinal plants for treatment of different ailments. The formulations prepared from medicinal plants vary considerably between Kavirajes of different regions of the country. The objective {{of this study was to}} conduct an ethnomedicinal survey amongst the Kavirajes of Chalna area, Khulna district, Bangladesh. That area is known to contain a diversity of medicinal plants. Information on 50 <b>plant</b> species <b>was</b> obtained. These medicinal plants belonged to 49 genera and 33 families. Twenty five <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> used to treat skin diseases and twenty three plants for treatment of intestinal tract disorders, which included constipation, indigestion, stomachache, diarrhea, and dysentery. Fourteen <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> also used by the Kavirajes to treat cancer or tumor. Nine <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> used as insecticide, eight for rheumatoid arthritis, and seven for wounds. Five <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> used to treat jaundice. Five <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> also utilized to treat animal and snake bites, which included tiger bites. Six <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> used to treat diabetes, and two each for the treatment of leprosy, and sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea. Five <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> used to treat impotency, while one <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> used as an abortifacient. Three <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> used to treat helminthiasis, which we found to be quite common amongst the population, while four <b>plants</b> <b>were</b> used to treat heart disorders.
