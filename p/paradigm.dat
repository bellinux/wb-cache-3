5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) <b>paradigm</b> which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This <b>paradigm</b> focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management <b>paradigm.</b> Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E

25|$|In {{analogy with}} Thomas Kuhn's {{definition}} of a scientific <b>paradigm,</b> Dosi has defined a technological <b>paradigm</b> as the general outlook on the productive problems faced by firms. As such, a technological <b>paradigm</b> is composed by some sort of model of the technology at stake (e.g. the model of a microprocessor) and by the specific technological problems posed by such model (e.g. increasing computational capacity, reducing dimensions, etc.). Therefore, technology is identified as a problem-solving activity in which the problems to be solved are selected by the <b>paradigm</b> itself. In this sense, a technological <b>paradigm</b> entails strong prescriptions on the direction of technological change, that is the direction toward which future technical improvements will converge.

Carroll explains that a <b>paradigm</b> shift is not a planned activity, rather it is an outcome of scientific effort within the current (dominant) <b>paradigm</b> that produces data that can't be adequately accounted for within the current paradigm—hence a <b>paradigm</b> shift, i.e. the adoption of a new <b>paradigm.</b>|$|E

25|$|In any {{community}} of scientists, Kuhn states, {{there are some}} individuals who are bolder than most. These scientists, judging that a crisis exists, embark on what Kuhn calls revolutionary science, exploring alternatives to long-held, obvious-seeming assumptions. Occasionally this generates a rival to the established framework of thought. The new candidate <b>paradigm</b> will appear {{to be accompanied by}} numerous anomalies, partly because it is still so new and incomplete. The majority of the scientific community will oppose any conceptual change, and, Kuhn emphasizes, so they should. To fulfill its potential, a scientific community needs to contain both individuals who are bold and individuals who are conservative. There are many examples in the history of science in which confidence in the established frame of thought was eventually vindicated. It is almost impossible to predict whether the anomalies in a candidate for a new <b>paradigm</b> will eventually be resolved. Those scientists who possess an exceptional ability to recognize a theory's potential will be the first whose preference is likely to shift in favour of the challenging <b>paradigm.</b> There typically follows a period in which there are adherents of both paradigms.

These <b>paradigms</b> are well suited for studies {{in the field of}} developmental cognitive neuroscience as they can be applied without collecting a behavioral response and across all age groups. Furthermore, repetition suppression <b>paradigms</b> can be employed in various neuroscience techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). In the present article we review studies using repetition suppression <b>paradigms</b> in developmental cognitive neuroscience covering the age range from infancy to adolescence. Our first goal is to point out characteristics of developmental repetition suppression effects. In doing so, we discuss the relationship of the direction of repetition effects (suppression vs enhancement) with developmental factors, and address the question how the direction of repetition effects might be related to looking-time effects in behavioral infant <b>paradigms,</b> the most prominently used behavioral measure in infant research.
