5|$|Pregnancy is {{associated}} with an increased risk of thrombosis. This probably results from a physiological hypercoagulability in pregnancy that protects against <b>postpartum</b> hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|After women give birth, about 5% develop <b>postpartum</b> {{thyroiditis}} {{which can}} occur up {{to nine months}} afterwards. This {{is characterized by a}} short period of hyperthyroidism followed by a period of hypothyroidism; 20–40% remain permanently hypothyroid.|$|E
5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months <b>postpartum.</b> There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months <b>postpartum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other acute health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive elements {{are common in}} developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, <b>postpartum</b> bleeding, and acute myocardial infarction. These are potentially life-threatening conditions, yet effective treatment is often unavailable {{for much of the}} world's population.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is managed}} with {{replacement}} of the hormone thyroxine. This is usually given daily as an oral supplement, and may take {{a few weeks to}} become effective. Some causes of hypothyroidism, such as <b>Postpartum</b> thyroiditis and Subacute thyroiditis may be transient and pass over time, and other causes such as iodine deficiency may be able to be rectified with dietary supplementation.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation of {{the thyroid}} is called thyroiditis. Inflamed thyroids may cause {{symptoms}} of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Two types thyroiditis initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes {{followed by a}} period of hypothyroidism – Hashimoto's thyroiditis and <b>postpartum</b> thyroiditis. There are other disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid, and these include subacute thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, Riedel's thyroiditis and traumatic injury, including palpation thyroiditis.|$|E
5|$|The lactational {{amenorrhea}} method {{involves the}} use of a woman's natural <b>postpartum</b> infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding. This usually requires the presence of no periods, exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and a child younger than six months. The World Health Organization states that if breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition, the failure rate is 2% in the six months following delivery. Six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months <b>postpartum</b> between 0% and 7.5%. Failure rates increase to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase its failure rate. In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months. In those who are not breastfeeding, fertility may return four weeks after delivery.|$|E
5|$|Numerous etiologies of {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{have been}} described. Pneumomediastinum was first {{recognized as a}} medical entity by Laennec, who reported it {{as a consequence of}} trauma in 1819. Later, in 1939, at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Louis Hamman described it in <b>postpartum</b> woman; indeed, subcutaneous emphysema is sometimes known as Hamman's syndrome. However, in some medical circles, it can instead be more commonly known as Macklin's Syndrome after L. Macklin, in 1939, and M.T. and C.C. Macklin, in 1944, who cumulatively went on to describe the pathophysiology in more detail.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the <b>postpartum,</b> placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Lhermitte {{was hired}} as a teacher. Shortly after {{beginning}} her new career, Lhermitte gave birth to her first child, Yasmine (b. August 13, 1992). Three years later, she delivered her second child, Nora (b. February 13, 1995). From June 1, 1995 to August 31, 1996, Lhermitte was granted leave from her teaching position due to <b>postpartum</b> depression. After the birth of Lhermitte's first child Yasmin, Schaar purchased a house for himself and the couple to live in, and he dedicated his apartment to his practice. In 1996, Schaar hired Moqadem to serve as his filing assistant part-time, then full-time in 1998. During this period, Schaar still covered most expenses, including vacations, house repairs, monthly allowances, and life insurance for each family member. Lhermitte gave birth to two more daughters, Miriam (b. April 20, 1997) and Mina (May 20, 1999), before the family's move from Brussels to the provincial town of Nivelles. Schaar paid the mortgage and lived on the second floor.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{was born}} in the small rural village of Isallawi in Orinoca Canton, part of western Bolivia's Oruro Department, on 26 October 1959. One of seven {{children}} born to Dionisio Morales Choque and Maria Ayma, only he and two siblings, Esther and Hugo, survived past childhood. His mother almost died from a <b>postpartum</b> haemorrhage following his birth. Ethnically identifying {{as a member of the}} indigenous Aymara people, in keeping with Aymara custom, his father buried the placenta produced after his birth in a place specially chosen for the occasion. His childhood home was a traditional adobe house, and he grew up speaking the Aymara language, although later commentators would remark that by the time he had become president he was no longer an entirely fluent speaker.|$|E
5|$|The vital {{nature of}} coping {{with the lack of}} {{resources}} available in international emergency medicine may be seen in the proportion of scientific articles that grapple with the topic. Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the international emergency medicine literature from 2010, 14 were classified as dealing with the practice of emergency medicine in resource-constrained environments. A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in the World Journal of Surgery by Mihir Shah et al. Topics covered included the use of the Broselow tape as the best estimate for children's weight, green bananas as an effective treatment for diarrhea, and misoprostol as a potential alternative for <b>postpartum</b> hemorrhage when oxytocin is not available.|$|E
5|$|The risk of VTE is {{increased}} in pregnancy by {{about five times}} because of a more hypercoagulable state, a likely adaptation against fatal <b>postpartum</b> hemorrhage. Additionally, pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times increased risk for VTE. Preventative treatments for pregnancy-related VTE in hypercoagulable women were suggested by the ACCP. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with {{a family history of}} VTE were suggested for antepartum LMWH and either LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the six weeks following childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia and a family history but no previous VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or—for those without protein C or S deficiency—a VKA. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with no personal or family history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or a VKA for six weeks after childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia but no family or personal history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting only. Warfarin, a common VKA, can cause harm to the fetus and is not used for VTE prevention during pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{was born}} on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was {{the second of the}} seven {{children}} of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth. The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother's bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably <b>postpartum</b> depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.|$|E
25|$|The {{older women}} in the {{compound}} or community look after {{women in the}}ir <b>postpartum</b> period and assist with cleaning the baby and massage. Mothers receive <b>postpartum</b> teaching from the older women in the community. In the early <b>postpartum</b> period, there is great emphasis placed on {{the health and well-being}} of the mother and infant. Breastfeeding and <b>postpartum</b> abstinence is mandatory. Both mother and baby receive massages using shea-butter, palm kernel oil, and other oils. During this time, different colored and sized beads are tied around the wrist, waist, and ankles to monitor the growth of the infant. Older women will also keep a brass bowl full of herbs, mixtures, white clay, soft sponge, and charcoal. These items are believed to prevent health problems for the infant and mother.|$|E
25|$|The {{levels of}} larger ones are {{somewhat}} higher {{during the early}} <b>postpartum</b> period.|$|E
25|$|Each year, {{complications}} from pregnancy and childbirth result in about 500,000 maternal deaths, 7 million women have serious long term problems, and 50 million women have health negative outcomes following delivery. Most of these {{occur in the}} developing world. Specific complications include obstructed labour, <b>postpartum</b> bleeding, eclampsia, and <b>postpartum</b> infection. Complications in the baby include birth asphyxia.|$|E
25|$|Current data {{indicate}} {{little or no}} increased risk for <b>postpartum</b> depression among women who use ART.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{oxytocin}} is {{the drug}} of choice for <b>postpartum</b> hemorrhage. Ergotamine may also be used.|$|E

25|$|June 20, 2001 - Andrea Yates drowns her {{children}} in a bathtub. She {{was found to be}} suffering from <b>postpartum</b> depression.|$|E
25|$|Small bowel {{obstruction}} {{caused by}} Crohn's disease, peritoneal carcinomatosis, sclerosing peritonitis, radiation enteritis, and <b>postpartum</b> bowel obstruction are typically treated conservatively, i.e. without surgery.|$|E
25|$|Breastfeeding aids {{maternal}} {{physical and}} emotional health. Breastfeeding and depression in the mother are associated. Mothers who successfully breastfeed {{are less likely to}} develop <b>postpartum</b> depression.|$|E
25|$|In July 1999, Yates {{suffered}} a nervous breakdown, which culminated in two suicide attempts and two psychiatric hospitalizations that summer. She {{was diagnosed with}} <b>postpartum</b> psychosis.|$|E
25|$|A 1991 {{study at}} the {{hospitals}} in Guinea found that the main causes of maternal death were abortion complications, which were linked with hypertension, and <b>postpartum</b> bleeding.|$|E

25|$|For these reasons, it is {{paramount}} that clinicians hold a high suspicion of PPCM in any peri- or <b>postpartum</b> patient where unusual or unexplained symptoms or presentations occur.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{definition}} in question, <b>postpartum</b> hemorrhage {{is defined as}} more than 500ml following vaginal delivery or 1000ml of blood loss following caesarean section in the first 24 hours following delivery.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{medical record}} for inpatient care can include admission notes, on-service notes, progress notes (SOAP notes), preoperative notes, operative notes, postoperative notes, procedure notes, delivery notes, <b>postpartum</b> notes, and discharge notes.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{vaginitis}} includes atrophic vaginitis {{usually found}} in postmenopausal or <b>postpartum</b> women. Sometimes it {{can occur in}} young girls before puberty. In these situations the estrogen support of the vagina is poor.|$|E
25|$|Similarly {{to other}} GABAA {{receptor}} positive allosteric modulators such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol, tolerance {{has been found}} to develop with exposure to increased levels of allopregnanolone and related inhibitory neurosteroids. This includes downregulation and desensitization of the GABAA receptor, reduced effects of allopregnanolone and other GABAA receptor activators (e.g., GABA and benzodiazepines), and rebound or withdrawal effects upon falls in allopregnanolone levels. Moreover, changes in allopregnanolone levels have been implicated in adverse neuropsychiatric effects associated with the menstrual cycle (e.g., dysphoria, depression, anxiety, irritability) and <b>postpartum</b> period (e.g., <b>postpartum</b> depression), as well as in catamenial epilepsy (seizures).|$|E
25|$|<b>Postpartum</b> {{bleeding}} or <b>postpartum</b> hemorrhage (PPH) {{is often}} {{defined as the}} loss of more than 500ml or 1,000ml of blood within the first 24 hours following childbirth. Some have added the requirement that there also be signs or symptoms of low blood volume for the condition to exist. Signs and symptoms may initially include: an increased heart rate, feeling faint upon standing, and an increased breath rate. As more blood is lost the women may feel cold, their blood pressure may drop, and they may become restless or unconscious. The condition can occur up to six weeks following delivery.|$|E
25|$|Excessive dosage or {{long-term}} administration (over {{a period of}} 24 hours or longer) {{have been known to}} result in tetanic uterine contractions, uterine rupture, <b>postpartum</b> hemorrhage, and water intoxication, sometimes fatal.|$|E
25|$|Nurses {{that are}} {{involved}} with midwifery are independent of any organization. A midwife takes care of a pregnant woman during labour and <b>postpartum.</b> They assist with things like breastfeeding and caring for the child.|$|E
25|$|Between April and May 2005, Shields {{spoke to}} {{magazines}} (such as Guideposts) and appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to publicize her battle with <b>postpartum</b> depression, {{an experience that}} included depression, thoughts of suicide, an inability to respond to her baby's needs and delayed maternal bonding. The illness may have been triggered by a traumatic childbirth, {{the death of her}} father three weeks earlier, stress from in vitro fertilization, a miscarriage and a family history of depression, as well as the hormones and life changes which were brought on by childbirth. Her book, Down Came the Rain, discusses her experience, contributing to a greater public awareness of <b>postpartum</b> depression.|$|E
