There are two classes of GA 2 oxs, i. e., a larger class of C 19 -GA 2 oxs and a smaller class of C 20 -GA 2 oxs. In this study, the gene encoding a GA 2 -oxidase of rice, Oryza sativa GA 2 -oxidase 5 (OsGA 2 ox 5), was cloned and characterized. BLASTP analysis showed that OsGA 2 ox 5 belongs to the C 20 -GA 2 oxs subfamily, a subfamily of GA 2 oxs acting on C 20 -GAs (GA 12, GA 53). Subcellular localization of OsGA 2 ox 5 -YFP in transiently transformed onion epidermal cells revealed the presence of this protein in both of the nucleus and cytoplasm. Real-time PCR analysis, along with GUS staining, revealed that OsGA 2 ox 5 is expressed in the roots, culms, leaves, sheaths and <b>panicles</b> <b>of</b> <b>rice.</b> Rice plants overexpressing OsGA 2 ox 5 exhibited dominant dwarf and GA-deficient phenotypes, with shorter stems and later development of reproductive organs than the wild type. The dwarfism phenotype was partially rescued by the application of exogenous GA 3 at a concentration of 10 mM. Ectopic expression of OsGA 2 ox 5 cDNA in Arabidopsis resulted in a similar phenotype. Real-time PCR assays revealed that both GA synthesis-related genes and GA signaling genes were expressed at higher levels in transgenic rice plants than in wild-type rice; OsGA 3 ox 1, which encodes a key enzyme in the last step of the bioactive GAs synthesis pathway, was highly expressed in transgenic rice.

40|$|Plants evolved {{effective}} defense strategies against herbivores {{that depend}} on rapid and reliable recognition of herbivore attack, and subsequent induction of appropriate plant defenses. Two major defense strategies in plants involve direct and indirect defense mechanisms. Our group is using two crops, rice and sorghum, to understand their innate defense mechanisms against naturally occurring insect herbivores. For example, we could already show that herbivore feeding in rice elicits proteinase inhibitors, phenolamide (PA) accumulation and momilactones {{as part of its}} direct defense; however, many more metabolites against insects in rice can be predicted from our results of non-targeted metabolomics analyses. So far, we studied in detail and report here the role of two major rice PA conjugates, p-coumaroylputrescine (CoP) and feruloylputrescine (FP). 	Both compounds are strongly induced by chewing and sucking herbivore feeding. In bioassays with synthetic CoP and FP, mortality of rice sucking pest, brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), was enhanced by addition of CoP or FP to artificial diet at 100 µg/ml concentrations. However, chewing herbivore survival was not affected, leaving the importance of these compounds against chewing herbivores in question. Next, we identified genetic basis for phenolamide accumulation in rice by cloning the key biosynthetic genes. We show that phenolamides and their genes are expressed in tissue specific, as well as inducible manner in rice. While main constitutive gene expression and metabolite accumulation occurred in field-grown roots and <b>panicles</b> <b>of</b> <b>rice,</b> herbivores and mechanical wounding induced additional expression and accumulation of CoP and FP in the treated leaves. The accumulation patterns and wide distribution of phenolamides in plant kingdom suggested rapid evolution as well as multiple functions of these metabolites, especially during plant interactions with other organisms. 	In indirect defense, we report that herbivory elicits emissions of several volatile organic compounds in rice, dominated by monoterpene linalool, in insect species-dependent patterns. A generalist herbivore tended to provoke stronger responses in rice compared to its specialized insect pest. We hypothesize that such differential response lays in differential composition of oral secretions (and elicitor contents) as well as typical feeding behavior of generalist and specialist insects on rice plants. We also show that volatiles are emitted in diurnally specific patterns, suggesting differential way of communication between plants and insects during light and dark periods. We speculate that this might be an adaptation of plants to herbivore lifestyles, which are either nocturnal or active during the daylight, allowing plants to boost or relax their defense systems during diurnal cycle. status: publishe...|$|E

In this study, we investigated the seasonal changes of C, N and P concentrations, accumulation, partitioning, and C:N:P stoichiometric ratios in different plant tissues (root, stem-leaf, and <b>panicle)</b> <b>of</b> late-season <b>rice</b> under two irrigation regimes (continuous flooding, CF; alternate wetting and drying, AWD) and four N managements (control, N 0; conventional urea at 240 kg N ha 21, UREA; controlled-release bulk blending fertilizer at 240 kg N ha 21, BBF; polymer-coated urea at 240 kg N ha 21, PCU). We found that water and N treatments had remarkable effects on the measured parameters in different plant tissues after transplanting, but the water and N interactions had insignificant effects. Tissue C:N, N:P and C:P ratios ranged from 14. 6 to 52. 1, 3. 1 to 7. 8, and 76. 9 to 254. 3 over the rice growing seasons, respectively. The root and stem-leaf C:N:P and panicle C:N ratios showed overall uptrends with a peak at harvest whereas the panicle N:P and C:P ratios decreased from filling to harvest. The AWD treatment did not affect the concentrations and accumulation of tissue C and N, but greatly decreased those of P, resulting in enhanced N:P and C:P ratios. N fertilization significantly increased tissue N concentration, slightly enhanced tissue P concentration, but did not affect tissue C concentration, leading to a significant increase in tissue N:P ratio but a decrease in C:N and C:P ratios. Our results suggested that the growth <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> in the Taihu Lake region was co-limited by N and P. These findings broadened ou...|$|R
40|$|Part I {{describes}} the first total synthesis of ustiloxin D, an antimitotic natural product {{isolated from the}} water extract of false smut balls on the <b>panicles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rice</b> plant by the fungus Ustilaginoidea virens. Ustiloxins are 13 -membered cyclic depsipeptides with a unique chiral tertiary alkyl-aryl ether linkage. They are highly potent inhibitors of microtubule assembly. The total synthesis of ustiloxin D was accomplished from readily available D-serine and aryl fluoride starting materials. The key reactions involved a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction {{for the construction of}} the chiral tert-alkyl-aryl ether linkage, Sharpless asymmetric aminohydroxylation reaction for the formation of the β-hydroxy tyrosine moiety, regioselective methylation of the tyrosine amino group and macrolactamization. The synthesis provides a scaffold upon which we can construct other congeners and analogs to understand better the tubulin binding activity of the ustiloxin family of natural products. ^ Part II {{describes the}} synthesis of a series of bicyclic cyclopropylamines via Ti(II) -mediated intramolecular couplings of a terminal olefinic moiety and an N,N-dimethyl carboxamide moiety of amino acid derivatives. Good yields were obtained (74 – 83 %). The mechanism of the reaction was proposed. Two readily separable diastereomers were generated with each substrate. The diastereoselectivity may be explained by steric effects in the reaction transition structures. This aminocyclopropanation reaction is simple to operate using inexpensive Grignard and titanium(IV) reagents. It provides easy access to functionalized N-heterocycles. Six compounds were tested in neurotransmitter assays in CNS. ...|$|R

The study was carried out by using Variety MR 220 CLI of paddy obtain from MADA. Seven different types of organic fertilizer were prepared with treated by 1 : 500 EMI (Chicken Dung + EM), (Cow Dung + EM), (Paddy Husk Ash + EM), (Chicken Dung + Paddy Husk Ash + EM), (Chicken Dung + Cow Dung + EM), (Cow Dung + Paddy Husk Ash + EM) and (Chicken Dung + Cow Dung + Paddy Husk Ash + EM). Those treatments were used in this study to determine the most suitable different types of organic fertilizer treated with EM for the paddy crop. The conventional compound fertilizer were used as control treatment. The study was conducted in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with eight treatments and four replications.

Farmers' cultural practices and field situations were also assessed. Visual inspection based on the Standard Evaluation Scale (SES) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods were used in detecting RYMV infection. RYMV presence was established in all the four states surveyed. The virus was widely distributed in Kano state. The insect vectors of RYMV, such as Trichispa sericea Guerin, Chaetocnema pulla Chapius, Chnootriba similis Thunberg and Conocephalus longipennis de Haan, {{were found in the}} 4 states. Outbreaks of T. sericea occurred in many farmers' fields in Kano state. RYMV was detected more frequently on Oryza sativa L. than on O. longistaminata Chev. & Roehr and Echinochloa pyramidalis Hitche and Chase. Virus infection was not established in any other grass species, sedges and broadleaf plants tested.

40|$|Burkholderia glumae causes {{bacterial}} <b>panicle</b> blight <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> {{and produces}} major virulence factors, including toxoflavin, {{under the control}} of the quorum-sensing (QS) system mediated by the luxI homolog, tofI, and the luxR homolog, tofR. In this study, a series of markerless deletion mutants of B. glumae for tofI and tofR were generated using the suicide vector system, pKKSacB, for comprehensive characterization of the QS system of this pathogen. Consistent with the previous studies by other research groups, DtofI and DtofR strains of B. glumae did not produce toxoflavin in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. However, these mutants produced high levels of toxoflavin when grown in a highly dense bacterial inoculum (, 1011 CFU/ml) on solid media, including LB agar and King’s B (KB) agar media. The DtofI/DtofR strain of B. glumae, LSUPB 201, also produced toxoflavin on LB agar medium. These results indicate the presence of previously unknown regulatory pathways for the production of toxoflavin that are independent of tofI and/or tofR. Notably, the conserved open reading frame (locus tag: bglu_ 2 g 14480) located in the intergenic region between tofI and tofR was found to be essential for the production of toxoflavin by tofI and tofR mutants on solid media. This novel regulatory factor of B. glumae was named tofM after its homolog, rsaM, which was recently identified as a novel negative regulatory gene for the QS system <b>of</b> another <b>rice</b> pathogenic bacterium, Pseudomonas fuscovaginae. The DtofM strain of B. glumae, LSUPB 286, produced a less amount of toxoflavin and showed attenuated virulence when compared with its wild type parental strain, 336 gr- 1, suggesting tha...|$|R

Ectopic {{expression of the}} Os 02 g 15950 coding sequence, driven by the HWS (At 3 g 61950) promoter, rescued the hws- 1 flower phenotype in Arabidopsis confirming that EP 3 is a functional orthologue of HWS. In addition to displaying an erect inflorescence phenotype, loss-of-function mutants of Os 02 g 15950 exhibited a decrease in leaf photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance. Analysis {{of a range of}} physiological and anatomical features related to leaf photosynthesis revealed no alteration in Rubisco content and no notable changes in mesophyll size or arrangement. However, both ep 3 mutant plants and transgenic lines that have a T-DNA insertion within the Os 02 g 15950 (EP 3) gene exhibit smaller stomatal guard cells compared with their wild-type controls. This anatomical characteristic may account for the observed decrease in leaf photosynthesis and provides evidence that EP 3 plays a role in regulating stomatal guard cell development...|$|R
40|$|The <b>panicle</b> {{architecture}} <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> is {{an important}} characteristic that influences reproductive success and yield. It is largely determined by the number and length of the primary and secondary branches. The number <b>of</b> <b>panicle</b> branches {{is defined by the}} inflorescence meristem state between determinacy and indeterminacy; for example, the maize ramosa 2 (ra 2) mutant has more branches in its tassel through loss of spikelet determinacy. Some genes and factors influencing the number of primary and secondary branches have been studied, but {{little is known about the}} molecular mechanism underlying pedicel development, which also influences panicle architecture. We report here that rice OsRAMOSA 2 (OsRA 2) gene modifies panicle architecture through regulating pedicel length. Ectopic expression of OsRA 2 resulted in a shortened pedicel while inhibition of OsRA 2 through RNA interference produced elongated pedicel. In addition, OsRA 2 influenced seed morphology. The OsRA 2 protein localized to the nucleus and showed transcriptional activation in yeast; in accordance with its function in pedicel development, OsRA 2 mRNA was enriched in the anlagen of axillary meristems, such as primary and secondary branch meristems and the spikelet meristems <b>of</b> young <b>panicles.</b> This indicates a conserved role of OsRA 2 for shaping the initial steps of inflorescence architecture. Genetic analysis revealed that OsRA 2 may control panicle architecture using the same pathway as that of the axillary meristem gene LAX 1 (LAX PANICLE 1). Moreover, OsRA 2 acted downstream of RCN 2 in regulating pedicel and branch lengths, but upstream of RCN 2 for control of the number of secondary branches, indicating that branch number and length development in the panicle were respectively regulated using parallel pathway. Functional conservation between OsRA 2 and AtLOB, and the conservation and diversification of RA 2 in maize and rice are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Minimal {{information}} {{exists on}} whole-plant dynamics of mineral flow through rice plants {{and on the}} source tissues responsible for mineral export to developing seeds. Understanding these phenomena in a model plant could help {{in the development of}} nutritionally enhanced crop cultivars. A whole-plant accumulation study, using harvests during reproductive development under different Fe supplies, was conducted to characterize mineral accumulation in roots, non-flag leaves, flag leaves, stems/sheaths, and <b>panicles</b> <b>of</b> Kitaake <b>rice</b> plants. Results: Low Fe supply promoted higher accumulation of Zn, Cu and Ni in roots, Mn, Ca, Mg and K in leaves and Zn in stems/sheaths and a smaller accumulation of Fe, Mn and Ca in roots and Zn and Ni in leaves. High Fe supply promoted higher accumulation of Fe in roots and Zn in leaves and a smaller accumulation of Fe in leaves and stems/sheaths and Zn, Cu and K in roots. Correlation analyzes indicated that fluctuations in Mn-Ca, Zn-Cu, Zn-Ni, Cu-Ni, Mo-S, Ca-Mg, Cu-Mn and Cu-Mg concentrations in response to different Fe supplies were positively correlated in at least four of the five organs analyzed. Conclusions: Mineral content loss analysis indicated that mineral remobilization from vegetative organs can occur in rice plants; however, for seeds to acquire minerals, vegetative remobilization is not absolutely required. Also, mineral remobilization from vegetative tissues in rice was greatly dependent of plant Fe nutrition. Remobilization was observed for several minerals from flag leaves and stems/sheaths, but the amounts were generally far below the total mineral accretion observed in panicles, suggesting that continued uptake and translocation of minerals from the roots during seed fill are probably more important than mineral remobilization...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to clarify the extent of damage caused by stormy wind to the heading stage and milky ripening stage <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> plant. Special importance {{was given to the}} point of determining the conditions which bring about discoloration and sterility <b>of</b> <b>rice</b> <b>panicles,</b> that is, both the condition of the wind flow and the growing condition <b>of</b> <b>rice.</b> Moreover investigations were carried out on the grades <b>of</b> coloration <b>of</b> <b>panicles,</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>panicles</b> and percentage <b>of</b> sterility. The storm was created artificially by the wind tunnel installed at the phytotoron of Kyushu University. Storm treatment was done for three hours continuously by blowing wind artificially. The speed of the wind was 20 m per sec. and the relative humidity ranged from 40 per cent to 97 per cent. The results obtained were as follows; 1. Discoloration <b>of</b> <b>panicles</b> was observed only when the humidity of wind was below 70 per cent. 2. Discoloration <b>of</b> <b>panicles</b> was specially observed when the roots were damaged due to presence of H_ 2 S in the ground and the rice plant was grown under excessive nitrogen supply. 3. When the humidity of wind was high, brown spots and blackish coloration were observed on the panicles, and when the humidity was low discoloration and black coloration <b>of</b> the <b>panicles</b> were resulted. 4. Under high humid condition of the wind the weight <b>of</b> <b>panicles</b> reduced a little but under low humid condition the weight reduced remarkably. 5. At the heading stage the reduction <b>of</b> <b>panicle</b> weight was due to high percentage of sterility and at the ripening stage it was due to lesser weight of 1000 grains. 本実験は,水稲の出穂期および乳熟期における強風の被害について,本学ファイトトロン内に設置された風洞を用いて検討したものである. 実験ではとくに白穂がいかなる条件下で,また,どのように育つた稲に発生するかについて検討したが,穂の変色程度,穂重,不稔歩合もあわせて調査した. 強風処理はすべて風速 20 m/秒で 3 時間行なつた. 処理中の相対湿度は 40 ～ 97 %であつた. 得られた結果の大要は次の通りである. 1. 強風処理中の風の湿度と白穂の発生との関係は,本実験の範囲では,湿度が 70 %以下の場合に白穂の出現が認められた. 2. 根に障害がある場合や窒素肥料を多く施した稲でとくに白穂の出現が多かつた. 3. 強風処理によつて,穂に褐斑を生じるもの,黒色あるいは灰白色(白穂) に変色するものなど種々の程度に変色したが,一般に湿風処理では,褐斑を生じるもの,黒色に変色するものが認められたが,乾風処理では湿風処理にくらべ,変色の程度が強く,さらに,泥風条件では認められなかつた灰白色に変色するものが認められ,とくに窒素肥料を多く施した区で多数認められた. 4. 穂重は湿風区でも若干減少するが,乾風区での減少が著しかつた. 5. 穂重の減少は出穂期処理の場合は不稔歩合の増加,乳熟期処理の場合は 1, 000 粒重の減少が主な原因となつているものと思われた...|$|R

40|$|Burkholderia glumae is {{the chief}} causal agent for {{bacterial}} <b>panicle</b> blight <b>of</b> <b>rice.</b> The acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) -mediated quorum-sensing (QS) system dependent {{on a pair of}} luxI and luxR homologs, tofI and tofR, is the primary cell-to-cell signaling mechanism determining the virulence of this bacterium. Production of toxoflavin, a major virulence factor of B. glumae, is known to be dependent on the tofI/tofR QS system. In our previous study, however, it was observed that B. glumae mutants defective in tofI or tofR produced toxoflavin if they grew on the surface of a solid medium, suggesting that alternative signaling pathways independent of tofI or tofR are activated in that growth condition for the production of toxoflavin. In this study, potential genetic components involved in the tofI- and tofR-independent signaling pathways for toxoflavin production were sought through screening random mini-Tn 5 mutants of B. glumae to better understand the intercellular signaling pathways of this pathogen. Fifteen and three genes were initially identified as the potential genetic elements of the tofI- and tofR-independent pathways, respectively. Especially, the ORF (bglu_ 2 g 06320) divergently transcribed from toxJ, which encodes an orphan LuxR protein and controls toxoflavin biosynthesis, was newly identified in this study as a gene required for the tofR-independent toxoflavin production and named as toxK. Among those genes, flhD, dgcB, and wyzB were further studied to validate their functions in the tofI-independent toxoflavin production, and similar studies were also conducted with qsmR and toxK for their functions in the tofR-independent toxoflavin production. This work provides a foundation for future comprehensive studies of the intercellular signaling systems of B. glumae and other related pathogenic bacteria...|$|R
