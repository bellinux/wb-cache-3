5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the <b>plutonium</b> <b>compounds,</b> plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} phenomena [...] -and greatest theoretical challenges [...] -in condensed matter physics arise when $d$ or $f$ electrons are neither fully localized around their host nuclei, nor fully itinerant. This localized/itinerant "duality" underlies the correlated electronic states of the high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors and the heavy-fermion intermetallics, and is nowhere more apparent than in the $ 5 f$ valence electrons of plutonium. Here we report the full set of symmetry-resolved elastic moduli of $PuCoGa_ 5 $ [...] -the highest $T_c$ superconductor of the heavy fermions ($T_c$= 18. 5 K) [...] -and find that the bulk modulus softens anomalously over a wide range in temperature above $T_c$. Because the bulk modulus is known to couple strongly to the valence state, we propose that plutonium valence fluctuations drive this elastic softening. This elastic softening is observed to disappear when the superconducting gap opens at $T_c$, suggesting that plutonium valence fluctuations have a strong footprint on the Fermi surface, and that $PuCoGa_ 5 $ avoids a valence-transition by entering the superconducting state.

40|$|Two {{candidate}} flowsheets for dissolving glovebox floor sweepings in the HB-Line Phase I geometrically favorable dissolver {{have been}} developed. Dissolving conditions tested and modified during the laboratory program {{were based on}} the current processing scheme for dissolving high-fired Pu- 238 oxide in HB-Line. Subsequent adjustments made to the HB-Line flowsheet reflected differences in the dissolution behavior between high-fired Pu- 238 oxide and the MgO sand/PuF{sub 4 }/PuO{sub 2 } mixture in glovebox floor sweepings. Although both candidate flowsheets involved two separate dissolving steps and resulted incomplete dissolution of all solids, the one selected for use in HB-Line will require fewer processing operations and resembles the initial flowsheet proposed for dissolving sand, slag, and crucible material in F-Canyon dissolvers. Complete dissolution of glovebox floor sweepings was accomplished in the laboratory by initially dissolving between 55 and 65 {degree} in a 14 molar nitric acid solution. Under these conditions, partial dissolution of PuF{sub 4 } and complete dissolution of PuO{sub 2 } and MgO sand were achieved in less than one hour. The presence of free fluoride in solution,uncomplexed by aluminum, was necessary for complete dissolution of the PuO{sub 2 }. The remaining PuF{sub 4 } dissolved following addition of aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (ANN) to complex the fluoride and heating between 75 and 85 {degree}C for an additional hour. Precipitation of magnesium and/or aluminum nitrates could occur before, during, and after transfer of product solutions. Both dilution and/or product solution temperature controls may be necessary to prevent precipitation of these salts. Corrosion of the dissolver should not be an issue during these dissolving operations. Corrosion is minimized when dissolving at 55 - 65 {degree}C for one to three hours at a maximum uncomplexed free fluoride concentration of 0. 07 molar and by dissolving at 75 - 85 {degree}C at a one to one aluminum to fluoride mole ratio for another one to three hours. Generation of hydrogen caused by the dissolution of calcium metal should also not be a concern. No hydrogen was detected in the laboratory off-gas stream and insignificant metals of any kind are present in glovebox floor sweepings. Glovebox floor sweepings are generated at Savannah River in FB-Line during preparation of the feed material used in the metal producing bomb reduction process. It is usually after precipitation and during drying or conversion of plutonium fluoride to a PuF{sub 4 }-PuO{sub 2 } mixture at 500 {degree}C, that spil occur which can contaminate the converted cake with varying amounts of MgO sand or other glovebox materials. This contaminated converted cake mixture of PuF{sub 4 } and PuO{sub 2 } is packaged and stored in the vault fo eventual recovery of the plutonium. In the past, most recovery operations in HB-Line have dealt with PuO{sub 2 } as the only <b>plutonium</b> <b>compound</b> present in the material to be dissolved. However,since the plutonium in FB-Line glovebox floor sweepings is a mixture of plutonium fluoride (PuF{sub 4 }) and plutonium oxide (PuO{sub 2 }), the standar HB-Line dissolving flowsheet is not directly suitable for complete dissolution. This is because it is difficult to completely dissolve PuO{sub 2 } when the fluoride is complexed with aluminum {{and it is difficult to}} completely dissolve PuF{sub 4 } unless sufficient aluminum is present to complex free fluoride. These observations were previously confirmed during the initial flowsheet development work for dissolving sand, slag, and crucible materials in F-Canyon dissolvers...|$|R

Concentrations of beryllium over certain limits have a quenching effect on the fluorescence of the aluminum-Portachrome Blue Black R complex. The determination of trace amounts of aluminum in beryilium can be carried out despite this quenching effect by the method of standard addition. Samples of plutonium sulfate tetrahydrate prepared 9 to 12 months earlier were under investigation to determine the suitability of this compound as a primary analytical standard of <b>plutonium.</b> The <b>compound</b> was determined experimentally to contain four molecules of water of crystallization. Plutonium sulfate tetrahydrate was found to lose a major portion of its water of crystallization when heated at 115 ts C. Indications, but no conclusive evidence, of the existence of another intermediate hydrate of plutonium(IV) sulfate, were found. Microscopic examination of 1 -year-old crystals of Pu(S 0 /sub 4 /) /sub 2 /. 4 H/sub 2 / 0 shows no evidence of the effect of any alpha radiolysis on the water of crystallization. Continued exposure to a fluctuating atmosphere caused no apparent changes in crystal structure or weight. Heating Pu(SO/sub 4 /) /sub 2 /. 4 H/sub 2 / 0 to 325 ts C produced a dehydrated salt of weight equivalent to the formula, Pu(S 0 /sub 4 /) /sub 2 /. This material, although slightly hygroscopic, can be readily dried at 120 ts C and appears to be satisfactory for further investigation of its suitability as an alternate primary stand ard of plutonium. A method is presented for the rapid determination of milligram quantities of sulfateiIn pure plutonium sulfates. Plutonium is adsorbed on a cation resin and an acidimetric titration is made of the displaced hydrogen ion which is equivalent to the sulfate content of the sample. A technique used for the prevention of plutonium hydrolysis in neutral solution is described. The method may be applied to the determination of sulfate in any pure plutonium sulfate. A method is described for sampling and analyzing uranium in graphite waste. Sampling data indicate that representative sampling is obtained if the material is pulverized to less than 30 -mesh size before reducing to 20 to 50 -g portions for analysis. A HN 0 /sub 3 / (l - 3) digestion is sufficient for extracting the total uranium in the waste material.

Out-of-pile as well as in-pile experiments were carried out to gain essential knowledge on properties and behaviour under irradiation of these types of fuel. This paper gives an overview of experimental results within the project. JRC. DDG. F. 4 -Safety of future nuclear reactor...|$|E
40|$|The end of {{the cold}} war has {{resulted}} in the shutdown of nuclear weapons production and the start of dismantlement of significant numbers of nuclear weapons. This, in turn, is creating an inventory of plutonium requiring interim and long-term storage. A key question is, ``What is required for safe, multidecade, plutonium storage?`` The requirements for storage, in turn, define what is needed to stabilize the plutonium from its current condition into a form acceptable for interim and long-term storage. Storage requirements determine if research is required to (1) define required technical conditions for interim and long-term storage and (2) develop or improve current stabilization technologies. Storage requirements depend upon technical, policy, and economic factors. The technical issues are complicated by several factors. Plutonium in aerosol form is highly hazardous. Plutonium in water is hazardous. The plutonium inventory is in multiple chemical forms [...] some of which are chemically reactive. Also, some of the existing storage forms are clearly unsuitable for storage periods over a few years. Gas generation by <b>plutonium</b> <b>compounds</b> complicates storage: (1) all plutonium slowly decays creating gaseous helium and (2) the radiation from plutonium decay can initiate many chemical reactions-some of which generate significant quantities of gases. Gas generation can pressurize sealed storage packages. Last nuclear criticality must be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the recent}} {{discovery}} of plutonium-based superconductors such as PuCoIn_ 5, systematic {{studies of the}} electronic properties for <b>plutonium</b> <b>compounds</b> are providing insight into the itinerancy-localization crossover of Pu 5 f electrons. We are particularly interested in understanding the Fermi surface properties of PuIn_ 3 compound, which serves as the building block for the PuCoIn_ 5 superconductor. Motivated by the first observation of quantum oscillation and renewed interest in the de-Hass van-Alphen (dHvA) measurements on PuIn_ 3, we study the Fermi surface (FS) topology and the band dispersion in both paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic state of PuIn_ 3, based on density functional theory with generalized gradient approximation. We compare the results with its isostructural paramagnetic compound PuSn_ 3. We show the detailed Fermi surfaces of compounds PuIn_ 3 and PuSn_ 3 and conclude that the FS topology of an antiferromagnetic PuIn_ 3 agrees better with dHvA measurements. In addition, we show the magnetization of the antiferromagnetic order can alter the angle dependence {{and values of the}} effective mass for the dHvA orbits. We point out the accurate determination of the magnetic order orientation with respect to the crystal orientation is crucial to advance the understanding of the electronic structures of the PuIn_ 3 compound.

40|$|Actinide {{compounds}} {{attract a}} great interest for both materials scientists and nuclear engineers being 5 f-element based compounds used as nuclear fuels. Their properties, particularly relevant for uranium and <b>plutonium</b> <b>compounds,</b> combine strong electron correlation and relativistic effects. Only {{the combination of}} these two effects gives a proper description of magnetic structures in actinide compounds. Therefore, we have performed a detailed analysis of the magnetic structures and properties of UO 2, PuO 2 and UN on the basis of density functional theory with Hubbard electron correlation correction (DFT+U) as well as using hybrid functionals. Two plane wave DFT computer codes were employed, namely the pseudopotential code VASP [1] and the all-electron code Wien- 2 k [2]. The so-called DFT+U method incorporated in VASP [3] and the hybrid functionals in Wien- 2 k [4] are critically compared, in order to discuss the role of electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling effects. In particular, we compare the 1 -k and 3 -k magnetic structures for oxide compounds and underline how the strong correlations affect the magnetic behavior of UN predicted from DFT computations. In the frame of this analysis, we have applied different lattice distortions for all the three compounds and identified those giving the correct (experimental) description of the magnetic structures. All results obtained are discussed in the light of available experimental data and previous computations. JRC. E. 3 -Materials researc...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} spent fuel and {{high-level}} waste already available, and {{which will be}} produced by the future NPPs operation, calls {{for the evaluation of}} any possible technological solution that could minimize the burden of their disposal: reduction of Minor Actinide (MA) content, in addition to the radiotoxicity and radioactivity, and of the generated thermal load (decay heat). In this context, R&D efforts currently focus on the development of methodologies and technical solutions for Partitioning and Transmutation. MAs and long-lived fission products are in fact the main contributors to the long-term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel, and their transmutation to short-lived fission products, in fast spectrum nuclear reactors, in transmuters or in Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS), by neutron irradiation of dedicated fuels/targets, is a promising and widely investigated option. In order to provide substantial input for the safety assessment of innovative nuclear fuels dedicated to MA transmutation, several irradiation tests are being carried out. In some options, the investigated fuels/targets are uranium free, or of low uranium content, to improve the transmutation performance and contain high concentrations of MA and <b>plutonium</b> <b>compounds.</b> Two molybdenum based CER-MET fuels, called ITU- 5 & ITU- 6, were prepared at JRC Karlsruhe for the irradiation experiment FUTURIX-FTA (FUel for Transmutation of transURanium elements in phenIX/Fortes Teneurs en Actinide). The experiment performed from 2007 to 2009 in the Phénix reactor, France, in cooperation with CEA. The experiment ended after 235 equivalent full power days (EFPD) at a Linear Heat Rate of circa 130 W/cm and reached burn-ups of 18...|$|E
