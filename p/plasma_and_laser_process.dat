40|$|The velocity, density, {{and mass}} flow of {{particles}} suspended in a subsonic gas stream are {{important aspects of}} <b>plasma</b> spray <b>and</b> <b>laser</b> deposition <b>processes.</b> This paper will focus on two optical diagnostic techniques applied to the metal powder streams out of a powder feeder and into a new nozzle developed specifically for such applications. An important characteristic of the new powder nozzle is that it produces a very small column (approximately I mm diameter) of powder {{which can be used}} for small focus <b>laser</b> deposition <b>and</b> cladding <b>processes.</b> <b>Laser</b> Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) was applied to the nozzle`s output to better understand the kinetic parameters (velocity and spatial density) of exiting particles. Optical scattering of the powder stream was used to measure the total mass flow into the nozzle. Different light scattering detector scenarios applied to the input powder stream were used to identify signals useful for mass flow feedback control. Both of these techniques have the advantages of being fast, noninvasive diagnostics of the powder flow characteristics, and with a well established theoretical framework. Together, or individually, these diagnostics can provide real-time control or post-process analysis of the powder stream...|$|R

In the frame of GSI’s XRL activities a joint experiment {{has been carried out}} in collaboration with the XRL research groups from the Université Paris-Sud and the University of York [3]. The aim of this work was to gain insight in the complex <b>plasma</b> dynamics <b>and</b> <b>laser</b> amplification <b>process</b> <b>and</b> hence to identify parameters relevant for beam divergence, homogeneity, or spatial coherence improvement. The experiment was done at the 100 TW-facility of the Laboratoire Utilisation des Lasers Intenses (LULI) at Ecole Polytechnique (France). The system is a hybrid Ti:Sa-Nd:Glass CPA laser system which is capable of delivering pulses of up to 35 J with a duration of 350 fs. In a typical transient XRL a long (~ 1 ns) prepulse is focussed to a line creating a line shaped plasma of preferably Neon-like or Nickel-like ions. This plasma is then rapidly heated by a short laser pulse of high intensity thereby creating population inversion and a high transient gain leading to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) in the soft X-ray range. a) target b) distance from target (µm...|$|R

The re-deposition of contaminants sputtered from a tokamak first wall onto FMs could dramatically decrease their reflectance in an unacceptable way for the proper functioning of plasma diagnostic systems. Therefore, suitable in situ cleaning solutions {{will be required to}} recover the FMs reflectance in ITER. Currently, <b>plasma</b> cleaning <b>and</b> <b>laser</b> cleaning are considered the most promising solutions. In this work, a set of ITER-like rhodium mirrors contaminated with materials tailored to reproduce tokamak redeposits is employed to experimentally compare <b>plasma</b> <b>and</b> <b>laser</b> cleaning against different criteria (reflectance recovery, mirror integrity, time requirement). We show that the two techniques present different complementary features that can be exploited for the cleaning of ITER FMs. In particular, plasma cleaning ensures an excellent reflectance recovery in the case of compact contaminants, while laser cleaning is faster, gentler, and more effective in the case of porous contaminant.

The first part was aimed at improving our understanding of high-order harmonic emission in general and its time–frequency structure in particular. Spectrally, this harmonic emission consists of a comb of frequencies where each tooth in the “comb” corresponds to a pulse {{with a duration of}} the order of the laser pulse driving the generation process (typically a few tens of femtoseconds). Temporally, the superposition of several of these harmonics may form a train of attosecond pulses. In this work different methods of characterizing these XUV pulses have been studied, both experimentally and theoretically. Based on the technique of so-called sideband generation, which is simply the cross-correlation signal between XUV pulses and ultrashort infrared pulses (~ 10 fs) in a photoelectron spectrum, time–frequency characterization of individual harmonics has been demonstrated. Using a similar technique, trains of pulses of attosecond duration have also been observed. In the second part, the interaction between <b>plasmas</b> <b>and</b> <b>laser</b> pulses at relativistic intensities has been studied. Fascinating phenomena are observed, such as relativistic channelling and the acceleration of electrons to energies of several MeV over distances as short as 1 mm.
