50|$|The {{city was}} among the first in Santa Clara County to offer {{advanced}} life support (ALS) paramedic-level (EMT-P) ambulance service. In an arrangement predating countywide paramedic service, Palo Alto Fire operates two paramedic ambulances which are theoretically shared with county EMS assets. The Palo Alto Fire Department is currently the only fire department in Santa Clara County that routinely transports patients. Rural Metro holds the Santa Clara County 911 contract and provides transportation in other cities. Enhanced 9-1-1 arrived in about 1980 and included the then-new ability to report emergencies from <b>coin</b> <b>telephones</b> without using a coin. Palo Alto Fire also provides service to the Stanford University campus.|$|R

5000|$|A Universal International Freephone Number (UIFN) is a {{worldwide}} toll-free [...] "800 number" [...] {{issued by the}} ITU. Like the 800 area code issued for the NANP in the U.S. and Canada and 0800 numbers in many other countries, the call is free for the caller, and the receiver pays the charges. UIFN uses ITU country code 800, so that no matter where the caller is, only the international access code (IAC), the UIFN country code (800) and the 8-digit UIFN need to be dialed. A few carriers in about 65 countries participate in the UIFN program; free access to the numbers (as international calls) from mobile and <b>coin</b> <b>telephones</b> is not universal. Registration of a +800 number incurs a 200 swiss franc ITU fee (as of 2013) in addition to any charges levied by the individual carrier. The number must be activated for inbound calls from at least two telephone country codes within 180 days.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the table}} or desk area {{in front of}} the {{operator}} are columns of keys, lamps and cords. Each column consists of a front key and a rear key, a front lamp and a rear lamp, followed by a front cord and a rear cord, making up together a cord circuit. The front key is the [...] "talk" [...] key allowing the operator to speak with that particular cord pair. The rear key on older [...] "manual" [...] boards and PBXs is used to ring a telephone physically. On newer boards, the back key is used to collect (retrieve) money from <b>coin</b> <b>telephones.</b> Each of the keys has three positions: back, normal and forward. When a key is in the normal position an electrical talk path connects the front and rear cords. A key in the forward position (front key) connects the operator to the cord pair, and a key in the back position sends a ring signal out on the cord (on older manual exchanges). Each cord has a three-wire TRS phone connector: tip and ring for testing, ringing and voice; and a sleeve wire for busy signals.|$|R

50|$|The former Regional Bell Operating Company in Palo Alto was Pacific Telephone, {{now called}} AT&T Inc., and {{previously}} called SBC and Pacific Bell. One {{of the earliest}} central office facilities switching Palo Alto calls is the historic Davenport central office (CO) at 529 Bryant Street. The building was sold {{and is now the}} home of the Palo Alto Internet Exchange. The former CO building is marked by a bronze plaque and is located {{on the north side of}} Bryant Street between University Avenue and Hamilton Avenue. It was called Davenport after the exchange name at the introduction of dial telephone service in Palo Alto. For example, modern numbers starting with 325- were Davenport 5 in the 1950s and '60s. The Step-by-Step office was scrapped and replaced by stored-program-controlled equipment at a different location about 1980. Stanford calls ran on a Step-by-Step Western Electric 701 PBX until the university purchased its own switch about 1980. It had the older, traditional Bell System 600 Hz+120 Hz dial tone. The old 497-number PBX, MDF, and battery string were housed in a steel building at 333 Bonair Siding. From 1950s to 1980s, the bulk of Palo Alto calls were switched on Number 5 Crossbar systems. By the mid-1980s, these electromechanical systems had been junked. Under the Bell System's regulated monopoly, local <b>coin</b> <b>telephone</b> calls were ten cents until the early 1980s.|$|R

The main motive of designing this efficient and simple machine which will fulfill need of coins for transactions. In olden days the value of coins {{was much more than}} what it is today. Thus the system is designed so far that the people will not face problem of coins in public places. This project will provide coins for note of respective value, for this purpose we have developed mechanical coin dispensing model which will accepts the note inside system and checks whether note is fake or real, if it is found that note is real camera takes picture of that note. After that this will find out its value using image processing technique and then according to that value equivalent number of coins are dispensed from dispenser unit. Thus in this manner we are trying to design a robust and efficient machine which will be having a very low production cost as compared to other existing machines. In this system we have developed a MATLAB algorithm for image denomination to detect the value of a particular note, and we have implemented a fake note detection unit using Ultraviolet LED and photodiode terminology...|$|R

5000|$|The ancient harbor {{was partly}} {{excavated}} in 1962-1969 {{by a team}} sponsored by the American School of Classical Studies under {{the general direction of}} Robert Scranton. Excavations have uncovered several buildings that attest to the commercial vitality of the port throughout the Roman Empire and into the 7th century, when maritime activity and local habitation apparently diminished. The most impressive buildings located at the north and south ends of the harbor include blocks of rooms near the waterfront (probably warehouses); fishtanks; monumental complexes decorated with sculpted marble (possibly sanctuaries of Aphrodite and of Isis whose cults the 2nd-century CE writer Pausanias attests at the town), mosaic pavements, and wall-painting (either sacred structures, lavish seaside villas, or rich public benefactions); and a Christian basilica. Most distinctive among the many discoveries was over a hundred panels in glass opus sectile found in their original packing crates and awaiting installation in a possible sanctuary of Isis whose great annual festival is the scene of the climax of Apuleius' novel [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] which {{tells the story of a}} man turned into a donkey and back again (thanks to the intervention of the goddess).

50|$|The {{blue whale}} {{skeleton}} that has replaced Dippy is another iconic {{display in the}} museum. The display of the skeleton, some 25 m long and weighing 10 tons, was only made possible in 1934 with {{the building of the}} New Whale Hall (now the Large Mammals Hall). The whale had been in storage for 42 years since its stranding on sandbanks at the mouth of Wexford Harbour, Ireland in March 1891 after being injured by whalers. Discussion of the idea of a life-size model also began around this time, and work was undertaken within the Whale Hall itself. Since taking a cast of such a large animal was deemed prohibitively expensive, scale models were used to meticulously piece the structure together. During construction, workmen left a trapdoor within the whale's stomach, which they would use for surreptitious cigarette breaks. Before the door was closed and sealed forever, some <b>coins</b> and a <b>telephone</b> directory were placed inside—this soon growing to an urban myth that a time capsule was left inside. The work was completed—entirely within the hall and in view of the public—in 1938. At the time it was the largest such model in the world, at 28.3 m in length. The construction details were later borrowed by several American museums, who scaled the plans further. The work involved in removing Dippy and replacing it with the whale skeleton was documented in a BBC Television special, Horizon: Dippy and the Whale, narrated by David Attenborough, which was first broadcast on BBC Two on 13 July 2017, the day before the whale skeleton was unveiled for public display.|$|R
40|$|Following their divorce, Alice and Bob {{would like}} to split some of their {{possessions}} by flipping a coin. Unwilling to meet in person, and without a trusted third party, they must figure out a scheme to flip the <b>coin</b> over a <b>telephone</b> that guarantees that neither party can cheat. The preceding scenario is the traditional definition of two-party coin-flipping. In a classical setting, without limits on the available computational power, one player can always guarantee a coin-flipping victory by cheating. However, by employing quantum communication {{it is possible to}} guarantee, with only information-theoretic assumptions, that neither party can win by cheating, with a probability greater than two thirds. Along with the description of such a protocol, this thesis derives a tight lower bound on the bias for a large family of quantum weak coin-flipping protocols, proving such a protocol optimal within the family. The protocol described herein is an improvement and generalization of one examined by Spekkens and Rudolph. The key steps of the analysis involve Kitaev's description of quantum coin-flipping as a semidefinite program whose dual problem provides a certificate that upper bounds the amount of cheating for each party. In order for such quantum protocols to be viable, though, a number of practical obstacles involving the communication and processing of quantum information must be resolved. In the second half of this thesis, a scheme for processing quantum information is presented, which uses non-abelian anyons that are the magnetic and electric excitations of a discrete-group quantum gauge theory. In particular, the connections between group structure and computational power are examined, generalizing previous work by Kitaev, Ogburn and Preskill. Anyon based computation has the advantage of being topological, which exponentially suppresses the rate of decoherence and the errors associated with the elementary quantum gates. Though no physical systems with such excitations are currently known to exist, it remains an exciting open possibility that such particles could be either engineered or discovered in exotic two-dimensional systems...|$|R
40|$|An animal’s {{ability to}} move around an {{obstacle}} to reach a target is called detour behaviour. To perform such task the animal must first move away from its goal to subsequently reach it. The use of an asymmetric obstacle may provide information about the animal’s spatial reasoning or spatial learning. With spatial reasoning, the subject directly chooses the shorter way, while with spatial learning it chooses the shorter way as it goes along. Our aim was to investigate detour ability in horses where we employed an asymmetric obstacle test experimental protocol. Ten Italian Saddle horses, mares (9. 5 ± 3. 0 years) were used. Subjects were first accustomed to performing the detour task with a symmetric U-shaped obstacle (2 × 4 × 2 m and 1 m high). A breach in the obstacle permitted {{the passage of a}} food bucket through the opening. After this, one of the lateral sides of the obstacle was extended by 2 m (by means of a wooden <b>panel).</b> A <b>coin</b> was tossed to decide which arm to lengthen, but it was never in the same position more than twice in subsequent trials. An operator led the horse to the bucket and left {{it in front of the}} obstacle. As the horse ate, the bucket was pulled through the obstacle. The task was considered solved if the subject reached the bucket on the other side of the obstacle within 5 min. Each subject performed ten trials on the same day, for a total of 100 tasks. The direction chosen to move around the obstacle and time employed were recorded. Time was evaluated with ANOVA, while the exact two-tails Binomial test was used to analyze the side chosen for the detour. All subjects completed the task. Six subjects showed lateralized behaviour when detouring the obstacle (three on the left and three on the right), while the other four showed no preference for either side. Non-lateralized subjects significantly chose the short side (28 out of 40 trials; z= 2. 37, p= 0. 017). The time taken to perform the task did not differ over the ten trials for the whole group (F 9, 90 = 1. 259, p= 0. 272), for lateralized (F 5, 54 = 1. 736, p= 0. 108) and non-lateralized horses (F 3, 36 = 0. 556, p= 0. 820). The non-lateralized horses showed a significantly higher mean time to perform the detour compared to the lateralized horses (18. 7 ± 1. 3 vs 15. 9 ± 0. 7, F 1, 88 = 4. 52, p= 0. 036). These preliminary data seem to indicate that there could be individual differences between horses when they approach spatial tasks. Some horses may use spatial reasoning to solve spatial problems and they may need more time since their behaviour is the result of a decision making procedure regarding which way is the best, while other horses showed lateralized behaviour, always going around the obstacle on the same side. Therefore, horses appear to be able to perform detour with an asymmetrical obstacle, but the solutions found could differ between subjects. Both lateralized behaviour and spatial reasoning could affect the performance when horses cope with hurdle during competitions...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} to reach {{every person in}} a community {{is one of the}} major goals for emergency preparedness and response. The goal of emergency health communication is to rapidly get the right information to the entire population so that they are able to make the right choices for their health and safety. To do this, a community must know what subgroups make up its population, where the people in these groups live and work, and how they best receive information. Although knowing this type of information might seem obvious, many jurisdictions have not yet begun the process to define or locate their at-risk populations. To maintain consistency with the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA), this workbook uses the term "at-risk populations" to describe individuals or groups whose needs are not fully addressed by traditional service providers or who feel they cannot comfortably or safely use the standard resources offered during preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. These groups include people who are physically or mentally disabled (e. g., blind, deaf, hard-of-hearing, have learning disabilities, mental illness or mobility limitations), people with limited English language skills, geographically or culturally isolated people, homeless people, senior citizens, and children. Regardless of terminology, trust plays a critical role in reaching at-risk populations. Reaching people through trusted channels has shown to be much more effective than through mainstream channels. For some people, trusted information comes more readily from within their communities than from external sources. This document describes a process that will help planners to define, locate, and reach at-risk populations in an emergency. Additional tools are included to provide resources for more inclusive communication planning that will offer time-saving assistance for state, local, tribal, and territorial public health and emergency management planners in their efforts to reach at-risk populations in day-to-day communication and during emergency situations. If you follow the process outlined in this document, you will begin to develop a Community Outreach Information Network (COIN) [...] a grassroots network of people and trusted leaders who can help with emergency response planning and delivering information to at-risk populations in emergencies. Building a strong network of individuals who are invested in their community's well-being, who are prepared and willing to help, and who have the ability to respond in an emergency is just the start. You must also include network members in your emergency preparedness planning, test the capacity of your COIN to disseminate information through preparedness exercises, and make changes to your preparedness plans based on the evaluation of those exercises.
