In view of market and technology requirements the peat industry development is hampered by slow development of automated peat processing and utilization technologies. The acceleration of technological progress can be achieved by designing automated lines of advanced peat processing. In accordance with this mission the development of technological process monitoring parameters is of great importance thanks to the possibility of end product physicochemical properties being predicted and managed to make efficient use of peat products for energy needs. The software with an intuitive interface for automated production line of peat briquettes has been developed.

40|$|Ukraine is an energy-dependent {{country and}} aims {{to reduce the}} import of natural gas, heat, and power in general. This implies extracting fuel from her own natural resources; one {{relevant}} and readily available energy carrier for such extraction is peat (bio mass). Currently, the operating regimes of the drying of peat are not energy efficient; these operating regime maps were developed in the 1970 s and aimed only to get dry peat of required quality, without {{taking into account the}} cost of heat and electric energy in the drying process. The current quality of dried peat in the dryer does not always satisfy the necessary quality; e. g. parts of the peat may be insufficiently dried, or it may be over-dried. This affects the energy performance of <b>peat</b> <b>briquette</b> production. To improve the quality and energy efficiency of the peat drying process, an analysis of the drying process is carried out: an empirical mathematical model of the drying process is developed using the GMDH principle [1, 2, 3], mapping input parameters and disturbances to output qualities based on available experimental data. Next, with known (measured) disturbances, optimal input parameters for the drying process are found. Changing the operational parameters too fast leads to insufficient drying or over-drying of parts of the peat. Thus, to avoid changing the operational conditions too fast, the operational conditions are classified into a number of classes corresponding to a certain range of values for the operational parameters. Finally, an iterative procedure for changing the input parameters from the past values to new values is introduced. The resulting algorithm for finding the optimal operation of peat drying is based on mathematical models developed from experimental data, and aims to ensure improved quality and energy efficiency in the peat drying process...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} ways to improve {{physical}} and mechanical properties of cement concrete is an introduction of ash obtained due to {{burning of fossil fuels}} into concrete mix. The concrete mixes with ash are characterized by high cohesion, less water gain and disintegration. At the same time the concrete has high strength, density, water resistance, resistance to sulfate corrosion. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the possibility to use peat ash and slag of peat enterprises of the Republic of Belarus in the concrete for improvement of its physical and mechanical properties and characteristics of peat ash, slag, micro-silica, cement, superplasticizing agent. Compositions and technology for preparation of concrete mixes have been developed and concrete samples have been have been fabricated and tested in the paper. It has been shown that the concrete containing ash, slag obtained due to burning of peat in the industrial installations of the Usiazhsky and Lidsky <b>Peat</b> <b>Briquette</b> Plants and also MK- 85 -grade micro-silica NSPKSAUsF- 1 -grade superplasticizing agent have concrete tensile strength within 78 – 134 MPa under axial compression and 53 MPa – for the control composition. This index is 1. 5 – 2. 5 times more than for the sample containing no additives. The usage of peat ash, slag together with MK- 85 -grade micro-silica and NSPKSAUsF- 1 -grade superplasticizing agent for fabrication of concrete and reinforced bridge and tunnel structures will provide the following advantages: reduction of cross-sectional area of structures while maintaining their bearing capacity due to higher value of tensile strength in case of axial compression; higher density, waterand gas tightness due to low water cement ratio; high resistance to aggressive environment due to lower content of capillary pores that ensures bridge structure longevity; achievement of environmental and social impacts. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{method for}} protection of  {{bridges and tunnels}} against aggressive water action is surface waterproofing {{on the basis of}} an organo-mineral binder. Its structural strength can be increased by introduction of particles which are similar to the size of  asphaltenes and an elasticity of disperse medium has been increased due to introduction of polymers. These theoretical suppositions point out the possibility for simultaneous provision of flexibility at low temperatures and high heat resistance for mastics on the basis  of organo-mineral binders. In this regard a goal has been set to obtain a mastic high flexibility and high heat resistance  while using finely divided activated peat ash. Rubber crushed in accordance with ТУ (Technical Specifications) 38. 108035 – 87,  divinyl-styrene thermoelastoplast DСT- 30 Р- 20 ПС,  bitumen of grade 20 / 30 in accordance with СТБ ЕН 12591 – 2010, ash from burning peat at the Lida <b>Peat</b> <b>Briquette</b> Plant, multi-purpose industrial oil of solvent refining with high viscosity index, super-plasticizer – sodium salt which is a condensation product of aromatic carbon sulfo-oxidation with formaldehyde and neutralization with the help of sodium hydroxide (type 1) have been used in order to obtain the stated objective. While using these materials compositions and technology for preparation of organo-mineral mastics have been developed in the paper. Their tests have shown that a modification of finely divided  mastics carried out with the help of peat ash which is activated by super-plasticizer НСПКСАУсФ- 1, various polymer additives, contributes to an increase in their heat resistance, elasticity, water resistance, and also allows to control their technological and operational characteristics. The paper has experimentally confirmed that peat ash can be successfully used for preparation of high-quality waterproofing mastics which are so necessary for  protection of bridge and tunnel constructions. Its use will provide not only a great economic impact, but also contribute to improvement of ecological situation in the areas of peat burning and ash disposal. </p...|$|E
50|$|Solid fuel {{refers to}} {{various types of}} solid {{material}} that are used as fuel to produce energy and provide heating, usually released through combustion. Solid fuels include wood (see wood fuel), charcoal, peat, coal, Hexamine fuel tablets, and pellets made from wood (see wood pellets), corn, wheat, rye and other grains. Solid-fuel rocket technology also uses solid fuel (see solid propellants). Solid fuels {{have been used by}} humanity for many years to create fire. Coal was the fuel source which enabled the industrial revolution, from firing furnaces, to running steam engines. Wood was also extensively used to run steam locomotives. Both peat and coal are still used in electricity generation today.The use of some solid fuels (e.g. coal) is restricted or prohibited in some urban areas, due to unsafe levels of toxic emissions. The use of other solid fuels such as wood is decreasing as heating technology and the availability of good quality fuel improves. In some areas, smokeless coal is often the only solid fuel used. In Ireland, <b>peat</b> <b>briquettes</b> are used as smokeless fuel. They are also used to start a coal fire.|$|R

40|$|Layout: Irene MurtovaaraThe {{energy sector}} in Belarus makes up {{approximately}} 30 % {{of the industrial}} structure of the country. The role of the sector is large both in exports (36 % of the total export value) and imports (39 % of the total import value). Previously access to cheap gas from Russia {{and a lack of}} energy diversification policies have prevented Belarus from developing its potential local energy resources for energy generation. Nowadays energy security, which is determined primarily by the share of local energy resources in the overall energy balance, is the top priority. Currently, the share of local fuels is about 16 % of the gross consumption of primary energy and 17 % in the use of boiler and furnace fuel. According to the concept of energy security of Belarus the latter figure must be increased to 25 % by 2012. Belarus is poorly endowed with fossil resources, which have met only about 7 % of the country s primary energy consumption in recent years. The most valuable Belarusian fossil energy resource is high quality oil, but its residual reserves are estimated at only 55 million tons. The total reserves of peat in the country are identified as 4 billion tons, but most of these are in agricultural land, or assigned to environmental areas. The natural conditions of Belarus do not allow a large-scale use of such renewable energy sources as wind, solar and hydro. The greatest potential sources of renewable energy in Belarus are the forests. The annual increment of forests is about 28. 6 million m³; which can provide approximately 4. 6 million toe (tons of oil equivalent) per year. Therefore, it is wood and peat which will be the main sources of growth in the share of local energy resources in the energy balance of Belarus until 2020. The current annual harvest of woody biomass for energy is about 9 million m³ whereas the share of peat is over 3 million tons. In 2009, Belarus produced 5. 6 million m³ of wood in rough, 0. 6 million solid m³ of wood chips, 57 000 ton of wood pellets and briquettes, 1. 2 million tons <b>peat</b> fuel <b>briquettes.</b> The government has developed a series of regulatory documents to create a legislative, economic, financial, organizational and technical framework in the use of wood and peat fuels (Local Fuels Programme 2004, Woodfuels Programme 2009, Peat Programme 2008, Forestry Programme 2006). The target is 7 million m³ of wood in rough, 1. 5 million solid m³ of wood chips, 0. 8 million tons of wood pellets and briquettes, and 1. 5 million tons of <b>peat</b> fuel <b>briquettes.</b> However, there is a risk that the targeted increase in the production of woodfuels may cause an extensive use of high-quality logs as woodfuel, which will have negative environmental implications and cause a suboptimal exploitation of the forest resources. Many of these issues are not unique to Belarus and are being faced by several countries who plan to promote renewable energy...|$|R
