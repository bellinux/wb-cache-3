500|$|Investment {{powers and}} limits on those powers are {{set out in}} Part II of the Act. Section 3(1) states that [...] "subject to the {{provisions}} of this part, a trustee may make any kind of investment {{that he could make}} if he was absolutely entitled to the assets of the trust". This is far looser than the previous provisions, which were contained in the Trustee Investments Act 1961. The 1961 Act was repeatedly criticised for its [...] "very conservative investment policy for trustees". The powers of investment trustees were given were restrictive and narrow, {{and at the same time}} the trustees were expected to go through expensive and complicated procedures to exercise them. This new <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> is treated as a default provision - it is overridden if the trust instrument itself restricts the ways trust money can be invested. If the trust instrument was created prior to 3 August 1961, however, its provisions regarding investments are treated as void. The new provisions apply retrospectively, i.e. to trusts created before the passage of the Act. They do not, however, apply to trusts governed by the Charities Act 1993, Authorised Unit Trusts or occupational pension schemes.|$|E

Section 4(2) requires that, having exercised their <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment,</b> trustees must regularly refer back to the standard investment criteria to check that they are being fulfilled. This does little more than restate what is given in the Trustee Investments Act 1961, however, and this provision has been criticised for not defining [...] "suitable". In Cowan v Scargill [...] Ch 270 Megarry VC suggested that trustees have an overriding duty to invest solely in the financial interests of beneficiaries, unless the trust instrument laid down otherwise. So even though the National Union of Mineworkers' leader, Arthur Scargill, wanted the mineworkers' pensions to be reinvested in the British Coal industry and keep jobs, the court held that because this would make less money than other investments it would be a breach of trust.

He argues that the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> banks and other financial entities have led to income inequality and served as {{the driving force behind}} the creation of overwhelming debt obligations seen at the state and local level. The result, Lerner says, is a consolidation of economic and political power in the hands of a small number of banking and finance executives.

The compromise recognized the right of individuals to own private property and of associations, whether Indian or other, to similarly own property, thereby allowing for security, safety, and property of the mostly Spanish upper class whilst elevating Indian and Meztizo groups to equality before the law while simultaneously allowing them to retain their traditional pre-colonial and colonial customs and rights.|$|R
