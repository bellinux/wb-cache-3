25|$|Roussel Uclaf did {{not seek}} U.S. approval, so in the United States legal {{availability}} was not initially possible. The United States banned importation of mifepristone for personal use in 1989, a decision supported by Roussel Uclaf. In 1994, Roussel Uclaf gave the U.S. drug rights to the <b>Population</b> <b>Council</b> in exchange for immunity from any product liability claims. The <b>Population</b> <b>Council</b> sponsored clinical trials in the United States. The drug went on approvable status from 1996. Production was intended to begin through the Danco Group in 1996, but they withdrew briefly in 1997 due to a corrupt business partner, delaying availability again.|$|E

25|$|Of {{those who}} leave the state permanently, most go to Aguascalientes, Jalisco and other {{northern}} states. Those {{who come to}} live in the state arrive from Jalisco, Aguacalientes and nearby northern states. It is estimated that half of the people from Zacatecas do not reside in the state. Mexico's National <b>Population</b> <b>Council</b> estimates that 600,000 natives of Zacatecas now live in the United States, a figure that is equivalent to 40 percent of the state's resident population of 1.5 million.|$|E
25|$|Norplant II (Norplant-2, Jadelle), also {{developed}} by the <b>Population</b> <b>Council</b> and manufactured by Schering Oy, consists of two small (2.5mm × 43mm) silicone rods each containing 75mg of levonorgestrel in a polymer matrix, instead of six capsules. It was approved May 31, 1996 by the FDA as being effective for three years; it was subsequently approved November 22, 2002 by the FDA as being effective for five years. Jadelle has not been marketed in the United States; Jadelle is the successor to the original Norplant in USAID's contract beginning January 2007.|$|E

The original Norplant consisted {{of a set of}} six small (2.4mm × 34mm) silicone capsules, each filled with 36mg of levonorgestrel implanted under the skin in the upper arm and effective for five years. The original (six capsule) Norplant's production has been phased out; USAID's contract ran until December 2006.|$|E

25|$|Mifegyne was {{subsequently}} approved in Great Britain on July 1, 1991, and in Sweden in September 1992, but {{until his retirement}} in late April 1994, Hoechst AG chairman Wolfgang Hilger, a devout Roman Catholic, blocked any further expansion in availability. On May 16, 1994, Roussel-Uclaf announced it was donating without remuneration all rights for medical uses of mifepristone in the United States to the <b>Population</b> <b>Council,</b> which subsequently licensed mifepristone to Danco Laboratories, a new single-product company immune to antiabortion boycotts, which won FDA approval as Mifeprex on September 28, 2000.|$|E
25|$|The Querétaro {{metropolitan}} area comprises {{the municipalities of}} Querétaro, Corregidora, El Marqués and Huimilpan with a total population in 2010 of 1,097,028. According to data from the National <b>Population</b> <b>Council,</b> Querétaro is the 10th largest metro area in Mexico, {{as well as the}} 128th largest in the Americas. The {{metropolitan area}} of Querétaro has seen a population growth of between 3.65 and 5.54 percent per year since {{the second half of the}} 1990s, which makes it the fifth fastest-growing in the country behind Cancún, Tijuana, Puerto Vallarta, Ciudad Juárez and Nuevo Laredo. The population of the metro area in 2005 was 738,921, with 58% living outside of Querétaro city proper. The municipality of Corregidora has the highest rate of population growth in the state at 5.54%. Most of the population growth is due to migration with people coming here from Mexico City, Mexico State and Guanajuato. It is estimated that in 2005, 10,465 people migrated to the metropolitan area.|$|E
25|$|According to the Mexican {{government}} agency Conapo (National <b>Population</b> <b>Council),</b> Oaxaca {{is the third}} most economically marginalized state in Mexico. The state has 3.3% of the population but produces only 1.5% of the GNP. The main {{reason for this is}} the lack of infrastructure and education, especially in the interior of the state outside of the capital. Eighty percent of the state's municipalities do not meet federal minimums for housing and education. Most development projects are planned for the capital and the surrounding area. Little has been planned for the very rural areas and the state lacks the resources to implement them. The largest sector of Oaxaca's economy is agriculture, mostly done communally in ejidos or similar arrangements. About 31% of the population is employed in agriculture, about 50% in commerce and services and 22% in industry. The commerce sector dominates the gross domestic product at 65.4%, followed by industry/mining at 18.9% and agriculture at 15.7%.|$|E
40|$|The Access-to-Treatment {{research}} {{initiative of}} the <b>Population</b> <b>Council's</b> Horizons program undertook 11 projects across Asia and sub-Saharan Africa from 2002 to 2008. The projects included a variety of cross-sectional exploratory studies, situation analyses, and longitudinal randomized, controlled intervention studies that examined service delivery, community awareness, health-seeking behaviors, adherence, cost, and other factors affecting treatment for adults and children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This article summarizes the key findings and lessons learned from these projects, and examines cross-cutting issues such as stigma, quality of life, and sexual-risk behaviors among people living with HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome on antiretroviral therapy. The article concludes with recommendations for evidence-based programming and future research around treatment for both children and adults...|$|R
40|$|The Female Condom (FC) is {{the only}} female-initiated {{prevention}} product {{on the market today}} that provides simultaneous protection against STIs, including HIV, and unintended pregnancy. Despite this unique dual protection benefit, the female condom remains limited in supply, not easily or widely available, and under utilized in many settings. Improvements in female condom programming are essential to achieve increased uptake and public health impact, as well as {{to pave the way for}} future women's HIV prevention products, such as microbicides. The <b>Population</b> <b>Council's</b> Female-Initiated Prevention Methods (FIPM) project, conducted in partnership with Liverpool VCT, Care & Treatment (LVCT), aimed to stimulate action and generate evidence around FC access through innovative program experimentation...|$|R

500|$|Birth control {{advocacy}} {{also took}} on a global aspect as organizations around the world began to collaborate. In 1946, Sanger helped found the International Committee on Planned Parenthood, which evolved into the International Planned Parenthood Federation and soon became the world's largest non-governmental international family planning organization. In 1952, John D. Rockefeller III founded the influential <b>Population</b> <b>Council.</b> Fear of global overpopulation became {{a major issue in}} the 1960s, generating concerns about pollution, food shortages, and quality of life, leading to well-funded birth control campaigns around the world. The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development and the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women addressed birth control and influenced human rights declarations which asserted women's rights to control their own bodies.See also: Petchesky, Rosalind Pollack (2001), [...] "Reproductive Politics", in The Oxford Companion to Politics of the World, Joël Krieger, Margaret E.
