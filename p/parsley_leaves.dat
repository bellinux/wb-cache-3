40|$|ABSTRACT: In this {{research}} the drying of four kinds of vegetables {{was investigated in}} a vacuum dryer. The effect of temperature on drying rate of samples at various temperatures (30, 35 and 45 °C) was studied. Six thin-layer drying models were fitted to drying data and suitable model was selected from them. Then effective moisture diffusivity and activation energy of samples were calculated. The Diffusion approximation model gave excellent fit for fenugreek and mint leaves and vegetative parts of leek and the page model was considered adequate to describe the thin-layer drying behavior of <b>parsley</b> <b>leaves.</b> The effective diffusivity values changed from 2. 92 × 10 - 10 to 9. 81 × 10 - 10, 1. 77 × 10 - 10 to 5. 99 × 10 - 10, 9. 3 × 10 - 11 to 1. 7 × 10 - 10 and 1. 27 × 10 - 9 to 3. 4 × 10 - 9 for fenugreek, mint and <b>parsley</b> <b>leaves</b> and vegetative parts of leek, respectively.

40|$|International audienceAbstract Aim: To {{investigate}} how {{the survival of}} Listeria monocytogenes on <b>parsley</b> <b>leaves</b> may affect its ability to sustain process-related harsh conditions and its virulence. Methods and Results: Parsley seedlings were spot inoculated with stationary phase cells of L. monocytogenes EGD-e and incubated for 15 days. Each day, bacterial cells were harvested and enumerated, {{and their ability to}} survive acetic acid challenge (90 min, pH 4. 0), to colonize abiotic surfaces and to grow as biofilms was assessed. After a 3 -log decrease over the first 48 h, the population stabilized to about 10 (6) CFU g(- 1) until the sixth day. After the sixth day, L. monocytogenes was no longer detected, even after specific enrichment. Incubation on <b>parsley</b> <b>leaves</b> affected the ability of L. monocytogenes to survive acetic acid challenge (90 min, pH 4. 0) and to adhere to stainless steel although the ability to grow as biofilm was preserved. To further investigate these physiological alterations, the mRNA levels of six target genes (bsh, clpC, groEL, inlA, opuC, prfA) was quantified using reverse transcription qPCR after 5 h of incubation on <b>parsley</b> <b>leaves.</b> A decrease was observed in all but one (bsh) target, including groEL and clpC which are involved in resistance to salt and acid. Moreover, the decrease in the levels of inlA, prfA and opuC transcripts after incubation on parsley suggested a repression of some genes involved in pathogenicity. In vitro assessment of mammalian cell adherence and invasion using Caco- 2 cells confirmed the repression of the virulence factor InlA; however, the virulence potential in vivo in the chick embryo model was not affected. Conclusion: Listeria monocytogenes did undergo rapid changes to adapt its physiology to the phyllosphere. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study highlights the physiological changes undergone by L. monocytogenes during/after survival on <b>parsley</b> <b>leaves...</b>|$|E

The variety influence on ascorbic acid was statistically significant by carrot, parsley root and also <b>parsley</b> <b>leaves</b> and by garlic. In carrots had late varieties Olympia and Tinga significant higher vitamin C content (more than over 60 [*]%) compared to early to half-late varieties Delicia, Kráska, Stupická and Nerac F 1. The growing site influence was significant only by <b>parsley</b> <b>leaves</b> and onion. The influence of the growing year {{was one of the}} most important factors, which influenced vitamin C contents in selected vegetables – except of carrot was this factor statistically significant by all sorts. Changes in vitamin C content in growing years were induced above all by different climatic conditions (temperatures and rainfall courses). Higher ascorbic acid content was by garlic in the year 2005, when lower tem­pe­ra­tu­res during July were noted compared to year 2004. In parsley root and leaves, onion and leek was noted higher ascorbic acid content in year 2005, when average temperatures in August were as far as 2 °C lower than in year 2004. In the case of leek could the increase of ascorbic acid in year 2005 result also from minimal rainfall during October in comparison with October 2004. By all storaged vegetables was noted statistically significant decrease of vitamin C after 30 -days storage. The losses of vitamin C were highest in carrot (45 [*]%), followed by parsley (25 [*]%), garlic (24 [*]%) and onion (22 [*]%). Vitamin C content was the highest by <b>parsley</b> <b>leaves</b> (1692 [*]mg .  kg− 1), parsley contained high vitamin C amounts also in root (515 [*]mg .  kg− 1).

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{maintain}} the cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]cyt) at homeostatic levels has been examined during leaf senescence in detached parsley (Petroselinum crispum) leaves. Fluorescence ratiometric imaging of mesophyll cells isolated from <b>parsley</b> <b>leaves</b> at various senescence stages and loaded with the Ca 2 + indicator fura- 2 has revealed a distinct elevation of [Ca 2 +]cyt, which {{was positively correlated with}} the progress of leaf senescence. This initial increase of [Ca 2 +]cyt, which was first observed in cells isolated from 3 -d-senescent leaves, occurred 1 d before or in parallel with changes in two established senescence parameters, chlorophyll loss and lipid peroxidation. However, the [Ca 2 +]cyt elevation followed by 2 d the initial increase in the senescence-associated proteolysis. Whereas the [Ca 2 +]cyt of nonsenescent cells remained at the basal level, the elevated [Ca 2 +]cyt of the senescent cells was a long-lasting effect. Experimental retardation of senescence processes, achieved by pretreatment of detached leaves with the cytokinin benzyladenine, resulted in maintenance of homeostatic levels of [Ca 2 +]cyt in cells isolated from 3 -d-senescent leaves. These observations demonstrate {{for the first time to}} our knowledge a correlation between elevated [Ca 2 +]cyt and the process of senescence in <b>parsley</b> <b>leaves.</b> Such senescence-associated elevation of [Ca 2 +]cyt, which presumably results from a loss of the cell's capability to extrude Ca 2 +, may serve as a signal inducing subsequent deteriorative processes...|$|E

40|$|Gas {{transfer}} {{properties of}} wheat gluten (WG) coated paper {{and their ability}} to fulfil the requirements in eMAP of fresh parsley were studied. Permeation of gases through WG-paper was demonstrated to be RH-dependent and closely related to structural modification in the WG layer. Formation of micro-cracks was evidenced in dry conditions; but when increasing RH, plasticisation occurs within the protein layer and micro-fractures were reduced until disappearance. This reversible phenomenon allowed the WG-layer to recover its integrity at RH higher than 70 %, and the WG character to be expressed in such conditions. When used at 20 degrees C and 80 % RH as part of the packaging of parsley, modified atmosphere was created and a steady state of 11 kPa O- 2 and 4. 5 kPa CO 2 was reached after 45 h.
