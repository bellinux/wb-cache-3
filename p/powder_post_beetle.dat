40|$|Interest {{is growing}} daily on the {{utilization}} of bamboo as a reliable supplement to wood in furniture production to mitigate the scarcity of wood raw material supply. This study explored the viability of recycling bamboo recovered from scaffold into intermediate raw material for indoor furniture production. Strips were processed from the recovered Bambusa vulgaris Schrad and were subjected to conventional treatment methods with some modification to simplify the treatment. The durability of the treated strip was evaluated in accordance with ASTM D 2017. A storage shelf was designed and fabricated using laminates made from the bamboo strips. The diameter and wall thickness of the recovered bamboo culms ranges from 6. 00 cm- 10. 00 cm and 10. 00 mm- 12. 70 mm respectively. The result shows that ordinary soaking of the strips in water for 3 weeks could make the strips to be sufficiently resistant to termite attack but fairly resistant to <b>powder</b> <b>post</b> <b>beetle.</b> Application of kerosene as a secondary treatment will make {{the resistance of the}} bamboo strip effective to <b>powder</b> <b>post</b> <b>beetle.</b> A Complete-Knock-Down (CDK) Magazine shelf suitable for office use was fabricated using road side carpentry workshop tools.

The fibre is digested in variable percentages, {{depending on the}} type of analysis, 20 to 48 % and, according to some authors, without the assistance of intestinal symbiotic microorganisms. Furthermore, there is published work referring to Hylotrupes, concluding that "starch” … “plays no role in the nutrition of the larvae". Nevertheless, considering that attacks of this species decrease with wood seasoning increasing and having been demonstrated, and that “lignin degradation products of spruce wood do not influence larvae development”, it is possible to suppose that cell walls alone are not sufficient to feed this wood boring species. Furthermore, Hylotrupes larvae have chisel shaped mandibles, similar to those of <b>powder</b> <b>post</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae that feed on starch and need to pulverise the wood to access the cellular content. Preliminary research suggests an utilization of wood fibre as well as of starch by larvae of H. bajulus.

5000|$|Frass is an {{informal}} term and accordingly it is variously used and variously defined. It {{is derived from}} the German Fraß, a past participle verbal noun of fressen, which means to gobble or to feed as an animal might. The English usage derives the idea of excrement from what larvae had eaten, and similarly also, the refuse left behind by insects. Such usage dates back to the mid nineteenth century. In modern technical English sources differ on the precise definition, though there is little actual direct contradiction. One glossary from the early 20th century speaks of [...] "...excrement; usually the excreted pellets of caterpillars." [...] In some contexts frass refers primarily to fine, masticated material, often powdery, that phytophagous insects pass as indigestible waste after they have processed plant tissues as well as their physiology would permit. Other common examples include the fecal material that insects such as the larvae of codling moths leave as they feed inside fruit, or that the likes of Terastia meticulosalis leave as they bore in the pith of Erythrina twigs, or the larvae of Cerambycidae or <b>powder</b> <b>post</b> <b>beetles</b> leave inside or below their tunnels when boring in solid or rotting wood.|$|R

A {{couple of days later}} the house is vented, aired and the air is sampled {{to make sure that the}} gas has dissipated. M e t h y l b r o m i d e (MeBr) is an odorless, col-orless gas, widely used both as a soil-sterilant and to control wood-infest-ing insects such as dry-wood termites, carpenter ants, and powderpost beetles. Recent evidence has shown that MeBr is a direct-acting carcinogen in the rat, where it causes stomach cancer. In hu-mans and animals, death results from pulmonary irritation and edema; non-lethal exposures can produce muscle weak-ness, abnormal reflexes, visual disorders, head-ache and malaise. Vikane (sulfuryl fluoride) is another highly toxic and odorless structural fumigant. Very li�le is known about the toxic effects of Vikane, and even the polyethylene sheeting commonly used to protect articles in the home during applica-tions is permeable to the chemical. Residues, consisting of inorganic fluoride, have been found on such soft household goods as rubber, feathers, rayon and wool as long as 40 days a�er fumigation. Still, these residues are not likely to be toxic. When used as a structural fumi-gant, MeBr and Vikane are mixed with another fumigant, chloropicrin, which serves as a warning agent to those handling either gas by irritating the eyes and nose. (Chloropicrin is also registered as a pesticide used to fumigant grain).

The purpose was to identify and understand the challenges of fabricating Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples or parts from a deep powder bed (more than 200 -mm deep) by SEBM {{and the necessity of}} applying post heat treatment. The resulting microstructure and mechanical properties of these Ti- 6 Al- 4 V rods were characterized along their building (i. e., axial) direction by dividing each rod into three segments (top, middle, and bottom), both before (i. e., as-built) and after hot isostatic pressing (HIP). The as-built microstructure of each rod was inhomogeneous; it was coarsest in the top segment, which showed a near equilibrium α-β lamellar structure, and finest in the bottom segment, which featured a non-equilibrium mixed structure. The tensile properties varied along the rod axis, especially the ductility, but all tensile properties met the requirements specified by ASTM F 3001 - 14. HIP increased the relative density from 99. 03 pct of the theoretical density (TD) to 99. 90 pct TD and homogenized the microstructure thereby leading to highly consistent tensile properties along the rod axis.

Larvae and teneral adults peaked at the time of premature fall of green leaves and flowers. Teneral adults of six age classes were recorded and all entered dormancy irrespective of the feeding time available to each age class. Females outnumbered males in the parent generation, while the sex ratio of new generation adults was not biased towards either sex. The phenological stages of rubber trees included leaf fall in late December and early January, leaf sprouting and new leaf production in January and flowering in February. All feeding stages of L. tristis peaked in abundance when premature leaves are most abundant in the leaf litter. Prediction of the timing of appearance of various developmental stages of L. tristis in plantations, invasion into buildings and intensity of population build up in rubber belts is possible by tracking the phenology of leaf fall in rubber plantations, time of return of post dormancy adults and the onset of summer rainfall. Perfect synchrony was recorded between the field return of parental adults with annual leaf shedding, the oviposition phase of parental adults with tender leaf fall at the time of leaf sprouting, and larval and teneral adult stages with premature fall of leaves. Premature leaf availability is suggested as contributing to the reproductive efficiency of parental adults, the survival of early developmental stages and of new generation adults during dormancy...|$|R

In order to simulate <b>powder</b> compaction and <b>post</b> compaction behaviour an appropriate constitutive model is required. To calibrate the constitutive model (e. g. a Drucker-Prager Cap model) a series of experiments were carried out including closed die compaction, uniaxial and diametrical compression tests. A newly developed apparatus consisting of a die instrumented with radial stress sensors was used to determine constitutive parameters as well as friction properties between the powder and die wall. The calibration of constitutive models requires accurate stress-strain curves. During die compaction the deformation of the powder material is determined by considering the elastic deformation (or compliance) of the system. The effect of different compliance correction methods was evaluated with regards to the accuracy of models predicting the pressing forces. A method for accounting for non-homogeneous stress states in instrumented die compaction was also developed. A complete data extraction procedure was presented. The breakage behaviour of flat and curved faced tablets was investigated and the breakage patterns of tablets were examined by X-Ray computed tomography. An empirical equation that relates the material strength to the break force was proposed. The constitutive model was implemented into the finite element package Abaqus/Standard to simulate powder compaction and breakage. A range of failure criteria have been evaluated for predicting break force of flat and curved faced tablets under diametrical compression.

40|$|In acute studies guar flour, guar {{powder and}} guar {{granules}} reduced mean post prandial insulin levels in normal subjects following liquid glucose. The flour and powder also reduced mean plasma GIP levels compared to glucose alone. Guar granules {{had no effect}} on the mean plasma glucose, insulin or GIP responses of either normal or non insulin dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects to a solid mixed meal but guar <b>powder</b> reduced mean <b>post</b> prandial plasma glucose, insulin, and GIP levels in both groups. Guar flour was not investigated. The mean glycosylated haemoglobin level of seven NIDDM subjects taking 25 g guar powder in bread daily for eight weeks was reduced after four weeks. Mean total serum cholesterol levels were also reduced whilst subjects were following the regimen but on termination returned to pretrial levels. In addition, the response to a meal immediately before and after supplementation was similar indicating guar powder has no carry over effect. Guar flour prevented the hypoglycaemia caused in two of six subjects by consumption of a drink containing alcohol and sucrose and a high carbohydrate snack. However it also caused higher blood alcohol levels and they appeared more intoxicated for five hours after the meal. When guar gum was given with a fat load it did not affect chylomicronaemia implying it is unlikely to impair bile salt reabsorption as has been suggested. Guar flour incorporation into a predominantly protein meal did not affect the rate of liquid or solid gastric emptying in normal subjects but significantly increased mean post prandial gastrin secretion. This {{may be due to the}} significant reduction in mean post prandial GIP levels also seen or to the buffering capacity of guar flour. None of the subjects enjoyed guar containing foods and it was difficult to prepare acceptable products. Therefore until a better formulation is available guar gum is of limited use in diabetic management...|$|R
40|$|The insect pest, African {{black beetle}} (Heteronychus arator (Fabricus, 1775)) is of {{considerable}} economic {{cost to the}} New Zealand agricultural industry, in regions where the insect is established and regular outbreaks are now occurring. Selection for Epichloë festucae var. lolii (Latch, M. J. Chr. & Samuels) C. W. Bacon & Schardl, stat. nov. et comb. nov. endophyte-perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) associations which do not cause toxicity to livestock and with strong resistance to African black beetle (H. arator), would be of significant value to farmers in regions where this pest is a problem. Epichloë festucae var. lolii strain AR 1 endophyte does not produce ergovaline, the alkaloid known to deter African black beetle (H. arator), yet pastures infected with this endophyte have moderate resistance to adult African black beetle (H. arator). Research into AR 1 is of importance, as to date {{there have been no}} reports of toxicity in livestock brought about by consumption of from AR 1 -infected pastures {{and in the absence of}} African black beetle (H. arator) this ‘novel’ endophyte can provide highly productive pastures. AR 1 endophyte produces secondary metabolites that are simple indole diterpenes, including paxilline and paxilline-like compounds. The numerous paxilline-like compounds produced by AR 1 are detected by a paxilline ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbant assay) and quantified collectively as paxilline immunoreactive equivalents. Earlier work suggested that these paxilline-like compounds could be the bioactive, or linked-marker associated with the bioactive compound(s), that provide some resistance to adult African black beetle (H. arator) feeding. The overall aim of this research was to determine if increased concentration of paxilline immunoreactivity was associated with a reduction in feeding damage using a series of adult African black beetle (H. arator) feeding trials on closely related AR 1 -infected perennial ryegrasses (L. perenne). A negative relationship was established between feeding damage from adult African black beetle (H. arator) and plant pseudostem paxilline immunoreactivity in AR 1 -infected perennial ryegrass (L. perenne) <b>post</b> exposure to <b>beetles.</b> However, it was not a simple relationship being complicated by: i) paxilline immunoreactivity ￼not reflecting endophyte concentrations; ii) the influence of cultivar on the expression levels of paxilline immunoreactivity; iii) the effect of African black beetle (H. arator) presence on expression levels of paxilline immunoreactivity; and iv) the paxilline ELISA quantifying the complete complex of paxilline-like compounds and not simply those that are bioactive. The highest concentrations of paxilline immunoreactivity were found in plant undamaged pseudostem and were not strongly correlated with the lower concentrations found in herbage. Therefore undamaged pseudostem is recommended as the section sampled if the entire plant pseudostem was not available. Low levels of feeding from adult African black beetle (H. arator) accentuated plant tiller production. However, the negative effects of high feeding pressure still affected plants four weeks post-exposure to beetles, with reduced paxilline immunoreactivity production and plant tiller numbers. Adult African black beetle (H. arator) were able to compensate the deterrent effects of AR 1 once an endophyte-free food source was available. Results from this research contribute towards further understanding the bioactivity of AR 1 endophyte against adult African black beetle (H. arator) and will underpin further research into the chemical basis for this resistance. The paxilline ELISA could potentially be used for screening E. festucae endophyte ryegrass associations that produce unknown compounds which deter African black beetle (H. arator) and which do not cause toxicity to livestock...|$|R
