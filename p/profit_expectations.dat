40|$|Given several {{different}} new product development projects and limited resources, {{this paper is}} concerned with the optimal allocation of resources among the projects. This is clearly a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP), because each new product development project has both a <b>profit</b> <b>expectation</b> and a loss expectation, and such expectations vary according to allocated resources. In such a case, the goal of multi-objective new product development (MONPD) is to maximize the <b>profit</b> <b>expectation</b> while minimizing the loss expectation. As is well known, Pareto optimality and the Pareto front are extremely important to resolve MOOPs. Unlike many other MOOP methods which provide only a single Pareto optimal solution or an approximation of the Pareto front, this paper reports a novel method to calculate the complete Pareto front for the MONPD. Some theoretical conditions and a ripple-spreading algorithm together {{play a crucial role in}} finding the complete Pareto front for the MONPD. Simulation results illustrate that the reported method, by calculating the complete Pareto front, can provide the best support to decision makers in the MONPD...|$|R

50|$|The {{accelerator}} {{effect in}} economics {{refers to a}} positive effect on private fixed investment of the growth of the market economy (measured e.g. by a change in Gross National Product). Rising GNP (an economic boom or prosperity) implies that businesses in general see rising profits, increased sales and cash flow, and greater use of existing capacity. This usually implies that <b>profit</b> <b>expectations</b> and business confidence rise, encouraging businesses to build more factories and other buildings and to install more machinery. (This expenditure is called fixed investment.) This may lead to further growth of the economy through the stimulation of consumer incomes and purchases, i.e., via the multiplier effect.|$|E

50|$|The {{scale of}} success {{run by a}} going concern is manifold, {{and there are no}} {{criteria}} that might be universally applicable to success. Nevertheless, there is one criterion by which we can generalise the rate of success in production. This criterion is the ability to produce surplus value. As a criterion of profitability, surplus value refers to the difference between returns and costs, taking into consideration the costs of equity in addition to the costs included in the profit and loss statement as usual. Surplus value indicates that the output has more value than the sacrifice made for it, in other words, the output value is higher than the value (production costs) of the used inputs. If the surplus value is positive, the owner’s <b>profit</b> <b>expectation</b> has been surpassed.|$|R

5000|$|Second, Keynes re-analyzed {{the effect}} of the {{interest}} rate on investment. In the classical model, the supply of funds (saving) determines the amount of fixed business investment. That is, under the classical model, since all savings are placed in banks, and all business investors in need of borrowed funds go to banks, the amount of savings determines the amount that is available to invest. Under Keynes's model, the amount of investment is determined independently by long-term <b>profit</b> <b>expectations</b> and, to a lesser extent, the interest rate. The latter opens the possibility of regulating the economy through money supply changes, via monetary policy. Under conditions such as the Great Depression, Keynes argued that this approach would be relatively ineffective compared to fiscal policy. But, during more [...] "normal" [...] times, monetary expansion can stimulate the economy.|$|E

40|$|Investments {{are based}} on <b>expectations</b> of future <b>profits.</b> The common {{perception}} of the investment and uncertainty relationship is that increased uncertainty reduces willingness to invest. Uncertainty is here defined as deviation from the expected outcome. In uncertain conditions, {{it may be difficult}} to establish a clear <b>profit</b> <b>expectation.</b> However, from the early development of investment theory the sign has been debated. Uncertainty can also be exploited for profit seeking and the sign may therefore be positive. Petroleum extraction is a complicated, slow and expensive process. Historically petroleum prices have been quite volatile, and it is a major uncertainty factor for petroleum producers. The forward looking nature of investment behavior creates several issues for investment theories and empirical modeling. Expectations of return and uncertainty are unobserved and challenging to quantify. When controlling for dynamic panel bias I find a negative relationship between investment and price uncertainty. If price uncertainty increases, investors on the Norwegian continental shelf are more likely to postpone or drop new investments...|$|R

It is not the propensity to consume or subjective expectations about future profitability that is crucial for Marx. It is the rate of exploitation and the social productivity of labour that are the key considerations and these in relation to the existing capital stock. While for Keynes the low marginal productivity of capital has its cause in an over-abundance of capital in relation to <b>profit</b> <b>expectations,</b> and therefore to a 'potential' over-production of commodities (the capitalist will not invest). For Marx the overproduction of capital is only relative to the social productivity of labour and the existing exploitation conditions. It represents an insufficient mass of surplus-value in relation to total capital. So that for Marx the crisis is, and can only be, resolved by expanding profitable production and accumulation, while for Keynes, it can supposedly be remedied by increasing 'effective demand' and this allows for government induced-production."Yaffe noted in 1972 that [...] "... passages in Volume III referring to the underconsumption of the masses in no way can be interpreted as an underconsumptionist theory of crisis.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{simulate}} <b>profit</b> <b>expectations</b> as an emergent property using an agent based model. The paper builds upon adaptive expectations, interactive expectations and small world networks, combining them into a single adaptive interactive <b>profit</b> <b>expectations</b> model (AIE). Understanding the diffusion of interactive expectations is aided by using a network to simulate the flow of information between firms. The AIE model is tested against a <b>profit</b> <b>expectations</b> survey. The paper introduces “optimal calibration model averaging” and the “pressure to change <b>profit</b> <b>expectations</b> index” (px). Optimal calibration model averaging is an adaptation of “model averaging” to enhance the prediction performance of multiple equilibria models. The px is a subjective measure representing decision making in the face of uncertainty. The paper benchmarks the AIE model against the adaptive expectations model and the rational expectations hypothesis, finding the firms may have adequate memory although the interactive component of AIE model needs improvement. Additionally the paper investigates the efficacy of a tuneable network and equilibrium averaging. Finding the tuneable network produces widely spaced multiple equilibria and the optimal calibration model averaging enhances calibration but not prediction. Further research includes disaggregating the AIE model, using an input–output table to reflect the intensity of interaction between firms of different divisions, and supplementing optimal calibration model averaging with runtime weighted model averaging. ...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} the network averaging technique. This technique is introduced because accurately determining the structure of real networks can be difficult and the network averaging technique provides a proxy for real networks. A second aim is to introduce the adaptive interactive expectations (AIE) model, which uses a ‘pressure to change <b>profit</b> <b>expectations</b> index’ to replace the utility curve maximising agent concept. The AIE model has an interactive expectations network, which is difficult to determine, so suitable to illustrate network averaging. The AIE model is tested against the Dun and Bradstreet <b>Profit</b> <b>Expectations</b> Survey. The paper finds network averaging improves the predictive performance of AIE over its benchmarks: the rational expectations hypothesis and the adaptive expectations model. The network averaging technique could be adapted to other situations where there are endogenous effects acting through difficult to measure networks. The AIE model could be readily applied to other forms of expectations and as a replacement for the utility curve maximising agent. Finally, in this paper AIE models <b>profit</b> <b>expectations,</b> which are an important issue in their own right because they affect investment decisions and whether one business will extend credit to another business. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Electric Vehicles (EVs) as the {{alternative}} {{of the current}} fossil fuels vehicles represent the most promising green approach to the electrification of {{a significant portion of}} the transportation sector. Taking the randomness of EV’s charging / dis-charging characteristics into consideration, a significant uncertainty will be added to the grid by the large penetration of EVs. Consequently, charging / discharging management of EVs in presence of large scale intermittent Renewable Energy Resources (RERs) are considered as the most significant challenge for the future smart grid. In this context, a novel market-oriented energy imbalance management scheme is proposed for the seamless integration of EVs to the grid. The proposed scheme which, unlike previous works, utilizes the grid’s operating characteristics model within the signaling game-theo-retic approach for the successful operation of electicity market. Optimal decision strategies for both EV owners and utility are devised by capturing the conflicting economic interests of players together under load/generation uncertainities. The maximization of the <b>profit</b> <b>expectation</b> of each market player in the presence of independent multi-generation resources is considered. This facilitates both the customer and utility to derive their robust bidding strategies. The efficacy of the proposed approach in reducing peak loads while satisfying customers needs are demonstrated by simulating the various scenarios of different penetration levels of EVs to the grid. Results show that the proposed methodology can successfully alleviate the peaks caused by the mass adoption of EVs with the better utilization of RER...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} optimal overhead allocation in {{a simple}} one-period setting with several divisions (production, sales or service departments). At the begin-ning of the period, headquarters has {{to decide on the}} procurement of a common input. The divisions possess private information on their respective marginal <b>profit</b> <b>expectations</b> of the common input. The objective of headquarters is to determine the most efficient overhead allocation mechanism. Different mechan-isms are compared. The conclusion is that the non-allocation of the common costs leads to a presentation of excessive <b>profit</b> <b>expectations</b> by the divisional managers and will thus induce an overinvestment in the common input. The Groves scheme prevents such a misallocation of resources only if collusion is precluded. In contrast, full-cost allocation leads to the first-best solution if allocation is based on a measure that ideally approximates the divisions' pro-portion of marginal profitability of the input. Thus, in the case of homogeneous divisions which benefit equally from the common input an equal allocation is optimal. In the case that divisions with higher profits benefit more from a common input, the allocation of overhead costs according to the divisional profits observable {{at the end of the}} period ('ability-to-bear' principle) can be optimal. ...|$|E
