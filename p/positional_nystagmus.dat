40|$|The GABAergic drug {{baclofen}} and the cholinergic drug physostigmine {{were administered}} to patients with upbeat and downbeat nystagmus. Baclofen (orally, 5 mg three times daily) reduced nystagmus slow phase velocity and distressing oscillopsia by 25 - 75 % in {{four out of five}} patients (two upbeat nystagmus; two downbeat nystagmus). Physostigmine (1 mg single intravenous injection) increased nystagmus in five additional patients with downbeat (1) or <b>positional</b> downbeat <b>nystagmus</b> (4) for a duration of 15 - 20 minutes. The different interactions of baclofen and physostigmine on neurotransmission subserving vertical vestibulo-ocular reflex could account for these effects. The response to baclofen appears to be a GABA-B-ergic effect with augmentation of the physiological inhibitory influence of the vestibulo-cerebellum on the vestibular nuclei. Similarly baclofen has an inhibitory effect on the velocity storage mechanism. Cholinergic action may cause the increment of nystagmus by physostigmine...|$|R
40|$|Background: Law {{enforcement}} officers routinely conduct psychophysical {{tests to determine}} if an impaired driver may be intoxicated or in need of medical assistance. Testing includes assessment of eye movements, using the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) and Vertical Gaze Nystagmus (VGN) tests, which are conducted at roadside by patrol officers. These tests previously have been validated when the subject is placed in a standing posture with head upright. However, certain conditions require that the subject be tested while seated or supine. Under these conditions, <b>Positional</b> Alcohol <b>Nystagmus</b> (PAN) could be induced and mistaken for HGN or VGN. Methods: The study was conducted at law enforcement training academy alcohol workshops in the Pacific Northwest. Ninety-six volunteer drinkers were tested when sober and three times after drinking alcohol by 40 volunteer officers experienced in administering the tests. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was measured objectively with a calibrated breath analysis instrument each time a subject was tested. Results: The number of eye movement signs observed during the HGN test at any posture increases with increasing BAC. The presence of VGN at any test posture occurs only {{in the presence of}} signs of HGN and only at high levels of impairment. PAN was most often observed at BACs of 0. 08 % and higher, but was never confused with the observation of HGN or VGN, regardless of test posture. Conclusions: The HGN test administered in the standing, seated, and supine postures is able to discriminate impairment at criterion BACs of 0. 08 % and 0. 10 %. The VGN test can identify high levels of impairment at any test posture. Therefore, these tests can be used by an officer to determine if a driver is impaired, regardless of whether the driver is standing, seated, or supine.

Methoda retrospective study of 62 patients with BPPV associated with Menière’s disease, that underwent Epley’s maneuver, and that were monitored during 12 months after elimination of <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus.</b> ResultsOne Epley’s maneuver was required to eliminate <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus</b> in 80. 7 % of the patients, two in 16. 1 %, and three in 3. 2 %; after elimination of nystagmus, positional vertigo was suppressed in 71. 0 % of the patients, improved in 27. 4 % and remained unaltered in 1. 6 %. Four weeks after elimination of <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus,</b> all patients were asymptomatic.

The disappearance of symptoms of vertigo could also be objectively established by diminished spontaneous and <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus</b> as well as diminished pendel deviations with eyes closed.

40|$|Migrainous vertigo (MV) is an {{increasingly}} recognized cause of episodic vertigo. However, the pathophysiology of MV {{is still a}} matter of speculation {{and it is not}} known to what extent the dysfunction is located in the central or peripheral vestibular system. The aim of this prospective study was to describe the clinical spectrum of acute MV and to clarify which structures of the vestibular system are involved. Testing of 20 patients with acute MV included neuro-otological examination, recording of spontaneous and <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus</b> with 3 D video-oculography, and audiometry. Pathological nystagmus was observed in 70 % of patients during acute MV: six had isolated spontaneous nystagmus, five had isolated <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus</b> and three had a combination of the two. Only a few patients showed additional ocular motor deficits. Imbalance was observed in all patients except one. Hearing was not affected in any patient during the attack. The findings during acute MV point to central– vestibular dysfunction in 10 patients (50 %) and to periph-eral vestibular dysfunction in three patients (15 %).

40|$|There are {{two forms}} of lateral semicircular canal benign {{paroxysmal}} positional vertigo: geotropic and apogeotropic. When the pathophysiological mechanism of the apogeotropic form is that of canalolithiasis, we can observe a transformation from an apogeotropic nystagmus into a geotropic one. Usually, this phenomenon happens simultaneously on both sides, thus enabling us to observe a right-beating paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus</b> when the patient lies {{on the right side}} and a left-beating paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus</b> on the left side. We describe a case in which the transformation occurred gradually, so that, after three head rotations from side to side in supine position, there was a right nystagmus beating toward the ground (geotropic) with the patient on the right side and a right nystagmus beating away from the ground (apogeotropic) on the left side. However, after further rotations we observed the nystagmus transformation also on the left side, with a geotropic nystagmus on both sides. The phenomenon of gradual transformation could happen because initially only a part of the debris moved from the anterior to the posterior aspect of the canal during head rotations...|$|E
40|$|Classification {{of various}} manifestations of benign <b>positional</b> {{paroxysmal}} <b>nystagmus,</b> due to canalolithiasis or to cupulolithiasis, {{as a reaction}} to movements and to the site of detritus, is now possible due to the integration of theoretical knowledge (relationships between the semicircular canals and/or ampullae and the vestibulo-ocular pathways) with the forms of nystagmus induced when the head is placed in various positions. A comparison is made of results in patients examined in three Departments, during the past 3 years, and data presented in the literature. Findings are presented in a database which enables the clinician to compare the standard diagnostic manoeuvres (Dix-Hallpike, Pagnini-McClure, Rose) with results obtained by placing the head in alternative positions. This approach offers all the information needed to identify the site of onset and hence to formulate a correct diagnosis, thus directly indicating the most appropriate liberating or repositioning manoeuvre or [...] {{in the case of a}} suspected central lesion [...] to suggest further tests.

40|$|This is {{a review}} of {{selected}} aspects {{of the history of}} the vestibular system (J. E. Purkyne, E. Mach, A. Crum-Brown) and of our current understanding of vestibular malfunction in clinical vertigo syndromes. Evidence is presented for a preliminary classification of central vestibular brainstem syndromes according to the three major planes of action of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) : (1) disorders of the VOR in the horizontal (yaw) plane (horizontal nystagmus, pseudo 'vestibular neuritis'); (2) disorders of the VOR in the sagittal (pitch) plane (downbeat nystagmus; upbeat nystagmus); (3) disorders of the VOR in the frontal (roll) plane (ocular tilt reaction; lateropulsion). The pathophysiology of peripheral vestibular disorders is discussed: a specific gravity differential between the cupula fluid and the endolymph (buoyancy mechanism) causes vertigo in benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo and <b>positional</b> alcohol <b>nystagmus.</b> Vestibular neuritis is probably a partial unilateral vestibular paralysis due to viral infection of the superior division of the nerve trunk. The common post-traumatic vertigo is explained by otolith dysfunction secondary to dislodged otoconia resulting in unequal loads on the macula beds and a tonus imbalance between the two otoliths...|$|R

40|$|In {{patients}} with positional vertigo a persistent <b>positional</b> direction-changing <b>nystagmus</b> (PDCN) of apogeotropic direction (a-PDCN) in the supine yaw plane {{has been described}} earlier 1 - 5. It {{has been suggested that}} the cupula in the lateral semicircular canal has a higher specific weight than the surrounding endolymph making the cupula sensitive to gravity. This condition is known as ”heavy cupula”. We have described, in Paper I, a geotropic persistent direction-changing nystagmus (g-PCDN) in patients during vestibular crisis 6. In addition, when the patient is in the supine position and the head is turned slowly {{from one side to the}} other it is possible to discern a zero zone where the geotropic nystagmus is absent. This is accomplished when the head is turned circa 10 - 20 degrees laterally. Theoretically this occurs when the longitudinal axis of the affected cupula is aligned with the gravitational vertical 7 - 9. On the assumption that a position dependent nystagmus such as persistent a-PDCN is caused by a heavy cupula in one of the lateral semicircular canals (LSCC), thus it could be hypothesized that a g-PDCN can be caused by the cupula that is lighter than the surrounding endolymph. We have called this new diagnostic entity “light cupula”. A similar phenomenon of a PDCN is seen in subjects with <b>positional</b> alcohol <b>nystagmus</b> (PAN) 10 - 18. This phenomenon is based on the” buoyancy hypothesis” 19, 20. In order to reproduce a clinical condition where the density of the cupula was lower or higher than the surrounding endolymph we examined the nystagmus pattern in different head positions in unilaterally deafferented patients during the stage of PAN 1 and PAN 2 respectively 21, 22. We compared results of nystagmus direction during PAN 1 (Paper II) with the findings in {{patients with}} light cupula in the LSCC (Paper I). Nystagmus direction in both supine and prone lateral head positions was compatible with that of a light cupula. However, the nystagmus directions at head straightforward in prone and supine position as well as the localization of zero zones deviated from the pattern seen in patients with a light cupula 21. We followed up nystagmus characteristics and nystagmus pattern in Paper III on the labyrinthectomized subjects during the stage of PAN 222. This study showed persistent a-PDCN according the theory 12. The nystagmus pattern in pitch plane was of opposite to that during PAN 1. Nystagmus in supine position was directed to the affected side during PAN 2 and to non-affected side during PAN 1 but the zero zones in both studies is found on the affected side. We were interested to see if the results concerning the nystagmus pattern in the experimental studies could be applied to patients during vestibular disability with g-PDCN permitting a lateralization of the affected side. In Paper IV we examined an extended series of 20 patients with g-PDCN nystagmus pattern during acute vestibular disability and at follow up 1 - 7 years later. Nystagmus patterns in different head positions were recorded, both caloric and otolith tests were carried out. Concomitant auditory symptoms as an indication of the affected side were rare. The slow phase velocity (SPV) of geotropic nystagmus was low and of equal intensity and did not present an indication of the affected side according to Ewald´s second law 23. With nystagmus analysis we found evidence for a cupula that is sensitive to gravitation, but did not find an applicable pattern for simply determination of the affected side by analysing nystagmus direction in the pitch plane and in lateral head positions. There was a high prevalence of migraine (40 %) and the patients also had problems with recurrent vertigo (80 %). The vestibular tests were pathologic in 60 % of the patients...|$|R
30|$|ENG is the {{recording}} of eye movements -it is the most available and widely used test of vestibular function (Kisilevsky et al. 2004) {{and is based on}} the principle of measurement of changes in the corneo-retinal potential which occurs with eye movements with respect to electrodes placed around the eyes. There are multiple tests within the ENG test battery such as oculomotor test, measurement of spontaneous <b>nystagmus,</b> <b>positional</b> testing and caloric testing. The gold standard for objective evaluation of unilateral vestibular deficit is caloric test. The main advantage of the caloric test is that it is the only vestibular function test that allows separate stimulation of each labyrinth. This makes the test highly sensitive for unilateral peripheral vestibular lesions. The caloric test uses a thermal stimulus (water or air) to induce flow of the endolymph in the semi-circular canals (SCCs) through creation of a temperature gradient {{from one side of the}} canal to the other. The main canal tested is the horizontal SCC since it is the canal anatomically closet to the external auditory canal and thus it develops the largest temperature gradient (Kisilevsky et al. 2004).|$|R

40|$|Rationale: Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{dysfunction}} and occlusion abnormalities {{can cause}} cochlear and vestibular disorders. This issue {{is at the}} crossroads of several disciplines: otoneurology, physiotherapy, dentistry, medical rehabilitation and posturology, which often makes it difficult to timely diagnose them and delays the onset of treatment. Aim: To assess the role of abnormal dental occlusion and TMJ disorders in the pathophysiology and clinical manifestation of cochleovestibular syndrome. Materials and methods: We examined 300 subjects with clinical signs of cochleovestibular syndrome, asymmetry of occlusion and/or TMJ dysfunction (the main group), 55 patients with signs of TMJ structural and functional disorders and occlusal disorders without a cochleovestibular syndrome (the reference group), and 35 healthy volunteers (the control group). All patients were examined by a neurologist, an ENT specialist, a dentist and a physiotherapist. A series of additional investigations of the brachiocephalic vessels, cervical spine, TMJ, auditory and vestibular function, premature tooth contacts were performed. Results: The main group patients had high values of TMJ dysfunction in the Hamburg test (5. 85 vs 2. 2 in the reference group) and higher proportions of patients with moderate and severe TMJ dysfunction (n = 243, 81 % and n = 13, 23. 7 %, respectively). The functional muscle test parameters and the results of manual muscle testing in the main group patients were significantly different from those in the control group (р 0. 05). Patients with cochleoves-tibular syndrome had 2 to 3 -fold higher rates of vertebrogenic dysfunctions than those from the reference group. The video nystamography technique detected the <b>positional</b> cervical <b>nystagmus</b> in 100 % (n = 300) of patients from the main group, whereas there were no nystagmus in those from the reference group. Voluntary dental occlusion in the main group patients was associated with a deterioration of postural tests in 61. 8 % (n = 185) of patients; in the reference group patients these parameters deteriorated in 38. 2 % (n = 21) of cases. According to T-SCAN assessment, 300 (100 %) patients from the main group had in imbalance of total distribution of the occlusion force (р < 0. 05 compared to the control group). The biggest number of patients from the main group (73. 7 %, n = 221) had an imbalance of occlusion force within 20 to 40 %, and in most patients from the reference group this parameter was in the range of 10 to 30 % (85. 5 %, n = 47), with 14. 5 % (n = 8) of this group having a normal balance of the occlusion force. Cerebrovascular reactivity parameters measured by ultrasound Doppler technique demonstrated a moderately significant (р < 0. 05) strain of the cerebral hemodynamic reserve in the posterior arterial system in patients with cochleovestibular syndrome. Conclusion: Cochleovestibular disorders can be caused by a dysfunction of the dentoman-dibular system and/or cervical / masticatory myofascial syndrome. After exclusion of any otogenic pathology in patients with cochleovestibular syndrome, their neurological examination should include a visual assessment of the occlusion and mandibular movements, as well as testing of the cervical and masticatory muscles.

The study included patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the posterior canal (PC-BPPV) whose diagnosis was secured by observing the typical nystagmus during the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The patients were then randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a placebo group. The patients in the intervention group were treated on their affected side using the Epley manoeuvre. During the treatment session the manouevre, which was carried out three times at most, was repeated as long as the patients displayed <b>positional</b> vertigo and <b>nystagmus.</b> The patients in the placebo group were treated on the contra-lateral, healthy side using the Epley manoeuvre. The success of the therapy was evaluated on the second day of the study by a second, blinded observer. The treatment was deemed successful when the Dix-Hallpike test was performed twice and did not provoke either vertigo or nystagmus. The evaluation drew on the data of 66 patients, of whom 35 patients were randomly placed in the intervention group and 31 patients were randomly placed in the placebo group. It was shown that patients who were treated with the Epley manoeuvre were eight times more likely to be symptom-free the day following the treatment than patients who received the placebo manoeuvre: in the intervention group, 28 of 35 patients (80 %) fulfilled the criteria for successful treatment, while only 3 of 31 patients (10 %) in the placebo group fulfilled these criteria. 43 percent of patients in the intervention group were already asymptomatic following a single Epley manoeuvre. During the study's four-week duration, 24 patients remained symptom-free and did not require further treatment. Only one patient remained symptomatic despite repeated treatment sessions. Following the treatment, 10 patients in the intervention group complained about mostly minor side-effects. Alongside the frequently observed vegetative side-effects, such as nausea and emesis, as well as instability when walking and standing, one of the patients displayed benign paroxysmal positional vertigo of the ipsilateral horizontal canal. The early evaluation of the therapy’s success after just one day minimised the influence of spontaneous remissions on the treatment results and showed that the Epley manoeuvre is an effective and rapidly acting therapeutic procedure in the treatment of PC-BPPV. However, a repeated application of the Epley manoeuvre is necessary in more than half of the patients...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-one elderly {{patients}} with dizziness underwent a comprehensive medical and otoneurological evaluation. The majority had vertigo, limited mobility and restricted neck movements. Poor visual acuity, postural hypotension and presbyacusis were also frequent findings. Electronystagmography revealed <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus</b> in 12, disordered smooth pursuit in 18, and abnormal caloric responses in nine. Magnetic resonance imaging showed ischaemic changes in {{six out of}} eight patients. Although dizziness in the elderly is clearly multifactorial, the suggested importance of vertebrobasilar ischaemia warrants further consideration as vertigo {{has been shown to}} be a risk factor for stroke...|$|E

Twelve cases were treated with steroid therapy and fourteen cases ware treated with non-steroid therapy. All cases had no response of caloric test at the onset and underwent therapy within one month since onset. The results ware as follows : Dizziness was significantly reduced by steroid therapy compared with non-steroid therapy. However, {{there was no difference}} of subsiding period of spontaneous and <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus</b> and recovery of caloric response between the steroid group and the non- steroid group...|$|E
40|$|We report 3 {{patients}} who complained of positional vertigo shortly after head trauma. Positional maneuvers {{performed in the}} plane ofthe posterior canal (PC; Dix-Hallpike maneuver) and the horizontal canal (HC; patients were rolled toeither side ina supine position with the head raised 30 °) revealed a complex <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus</b> that could only beinterpreted as the result ofcombined PC and HC {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (SPPV). Two patients had a right PC SPPV and an ageotropic HC SPPV, and I patient had a bilateral PC SPPV and a leftgeotropic HC SPPY. All 3 patients were rapidly free of vertigo after the PC SPPV was cured bythe Epley maneuver and the geotropic HC SPPV was cured by the Vannucchi method. The ageotropic HC SPPV resolved spontaneously. Neuroimaging (brain computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging scans) findings were normal inall 3 patients. From a physiopathological viewpoint, it is easy to conceive that head trauma could throw otoconial debris into different canals of each labyrinth and beresponsible for these combined forms of SPPY. Consequently, in trauma patients with vertigo, it is mandatory toperform the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, aswell assupine lateral head turns, inorder todiagnose PC SPPV, HC SPPV, or the association ofboth. Early diagnosis and treatment ofSPPV may help to reduce the postconcussion syndrome. KEY WORDS- benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, head trauma, <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus...</b>|$|E

40|$|Enlarged {{vestibular}} aqueduct (EVA) {{is one of}} {{the commonly}} identified congenital temporal bone abnormalities associated with sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing loss may be unilateral or bilateral, and typically presents at birth or in early childhood. Vestibular symptoms have been reported in up to 50 % of affected individuals, and may be delayed in onset until adulthood. The details of nystagmus in patients with EVA have not been previously reported. The objectives were to describe the clinical history, vestibular test findings and nystagmus seen in a case series of patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct anomaly. Chart review, included computed tomography temporal bones, infrared nystagmography with positional and positioning testing, caloric testing, rotary chair and vibration testing. Clinical history and nystagmus varied among the five patients in this series. All patients were initially presumed to have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, but repositioning treatments were not effective, prompting referral, further testing and evaluation. In three patients with longstanding vestibular complaints, <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus</b> was consistently present. One patient had distinct recurrent severe episodes of <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus.</b> Nystagmus was unidirectional and horizontal. In one case horizontal nystagmus was consistently reproducible with seated head turn to the affected side, and reached 48 d/s. Nystagmus associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct is often positional, and can be confused with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Unexplained vestibular symptoms in patients with unilateral or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss should prompt diagnostic consideration of EVA...|$|E
40|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} {{positional vertigo}} {{is the most}} common peripheral vestibular disorder. It can be defined as transient vertigo induced by a rapid head position change, associated with a characteristic paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>nystagmus.</b> Canalolithiasis of the posterior semicircular canal is considered the most convincing theory of its pathogenesis and the development of appropriate therapeutic maneuvers resulted in its effective treatment. However, involvement of the horizontal or the anterior canal has been found in a significant rate and the recognition and treatment of these variants completed the clinical picture of the disease. This paper describes the advances in understanding how this disease is generated and discusses the current therapeutic modalities...|$|E
