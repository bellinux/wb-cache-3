25|$|Analysis of {{polyphenols}} in chokeberries {{has identified}} the following individual chemicals (among hundreds known {{to exist in}} the plant kingdom): cyanidin-3-galactoside, cyanidin-3-arabinoside, quercetin-3-glycoside, epicatechin, caffeic acid, delphinidin, petunidin, <b>pelargonidin,</b> peonidin, and malvidin. All these except caffeic acid are members of the flavonoid category of phenolics.|$|E
25|$|Most {{frequently}} {{occurring in}} nature are the glycosides of cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, <b>pelargonidin,</b> peonidin, and petunidin. Roughly 2% of all hydrocarbons fixed in photosynthesis are converted into flavonoids and their derivatives, {{such as the}} anthocyanins. Not all land plants contain anthocyanin; in the Caryophyllales (including cactus, beets, and amaranth), they are replaced by betalains.

50|$|Raspberries contain phytochemicals, such as {{anthocyanin}} pigments, ellagic acid, ellagitannins, quercetin, gallic acid, cyanidins, <b>pelargonidins,</b> catechins, kaempferol and salicylic acid. Yellow raspberries {{and others}} with pale-colored fruits are lower in anthocyanin content. Both yellow and red raspberries contain carotenoids, mostly lutein esters, but these are masked by anthocyanins in red raspberries.|$|R
40|$|Chronic low-grade {{inflammation}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in the pathogenesis of obesity, due to its associated chronic diseases such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases and cancer. Thus, targeting inflammation is an attractive strategy to counter the burden of obesity-induced health problems. Recently, food-derived bioactive compounds have been spotlighted as a regulator against various chronic diseases due to their low toxicity, as opposed to drugs that induce severe side effects. Here we describe the beneficial effects of dietary anthocyanins on obesity-induced metabolic disorders and inflammation. Red cabbage microgreen, blueberry, blackcurrant, mulberry, cherry, black elderberry, black soybean, chokeberry and jaboticaba peel contain a variety of anthocyanins including cyanidins, delphinidins, malvidins, <b>pelargonidins,</b> peonidins and petunidins, and have been reported to alter both metabolic markers and inflammatory markers in cells, animals, and humans. This review discusses the interplay between inflammation and obesity, and their subsequent regulation via the use of dietary anthocyanins, suggesting an alternative dietary strategy to ameliorate obesity and obesity associated chronic diseases...|$|R
30|$|We {{have found}} that mosses, whose {{ancestors}} were the first land plants, may have made anthocyanins as early as 450 mya. Although {{we do not know}} if the enzymes were functionally orthologous to those homologues from more recently evolved plant species, the anthocyanin pathways were apparently available as long ago as the late Ordovician period to make both <b>pelargonidins</b> and cyanidins (Figures  2, 3, 4, 5). Our result is supported by known evolutionary biochemistry data (Mues 2002; Rausher 2006). Since flowering plants would not evolve for hundreds of millions of years after mosses, we can only assume that a primary function of these ancient pigments in bryophytes was UV protective and antioxidant in nature. This conclusion is supported in the moss literature (Bendz 1961; Post 1990; Mues 2002; Dunn and Robinson 2006). Although Bendz (1961) found the flavone Luteolin in some moss species, other species such as Sphagnum capillifolium have been shown to produce brick-red cyanidin (Mues 2002), especially under environmentally stressed conditions (Steyn et al. 2002; Bonnett et al. 2010).|$|R
25|$|The wine's color {{when young}} is often {{compared}} to that of garnet, frequently being much lighter than that of other red wines. This is entirely natural and not a winemaking fault as Pinot noir has a lower skin anthocyanin (coloring matter) content than most other classical red / black varieties. Callistephin, the 3-O-glucoside of <b>pelargonidin,</b> an orange colored anthocyanidin, is also found in the berry skins of Pinot Noir grapes.|$|E
2500|$|When philodendrons {{are ready}} to reproduce, they will produce an {{inflorescence}} which consists of a leaf-like hood called a spathe within which is enclosed a tube-like structure called a spadix. Depending on the species, a single inflorescence can be produced or a cluster of up to 11 inflorescences can be produced at a single time on short peduncles. The spathe tends to be waxy and is usually bicolored. In some philodendrons, the colour of {{the base of the}} spathe contrasts in colour with the upper part, and in others, the inner and outer surfaces of the spathe differ in coloration. The paler colour tends to be either white or green, and the darker usually red or crimson. <b>Pelargonidin</b> is the predominant pigment causing the red coloration in the spathes. The upper portion of the spathe is called the limb or blade, while the lower portion is called the convolute tube or chamber due to its tubular structure at the base. The spadix is more often than not white and shorter than the spathe. On the spadix are found fertile female, fertile male, and sterile male flowers. The fertile male and female flowers are separated on the spadix by a sterile zone or staminodal region composed of sterile male flowers. This barrier of sterile male flowers ensures [...] fertile male flowers do not fertilize the female flowers. The arrangement tends to be vertical, with fertile male flowers {{at the top of the}} spadix followed by sterile male flowers, and fertile female flowers very close to the bottom in the region known as the spathe tube or chamber. In some philodendrons, an additional region of sterile male flowers is found at the very top of the spadix. The fertile female flowers are often not receptive to fertilization when the fertile males are producing pollen, which again prevents self-pollination. The pollen itself is thread-like and appears to project out from the region where the fertile male flowers are located.|$|E
50|$|Acylated <b>pelargonidin</b> glycosides can be {{isolated}} from the red-purple flowers of I. purpurea. The acylated anthocyanins were all based on <b>pelargonidin</b> 3-sophoroside-5-glucoside, acylated with caffeic acid and/or glucosylcaffeic acid.|$|E
40|$|Improving the micronutrients in {{food has}} become an {{important}} field of the Second Green Revolution. In recent years, minor bioactive compounds such as polyphenols, pigments and carotenoids, have attracted more and more interest from both researchers and food manufactures as health-promoting and disease-preventing effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies. One of plant pigments, wheat anthocyanins as plant phenolics are increasingly attractive as natural compounds positively affecting consumer´s health and condition moreover wheat is staple food source consumed usually daily. For a purple, blue, or red colour of wheat seed are responsible glycosylated cyanidins, delphinidins, malvinidins, <b>pelargonidins,</b> petunidins, and peonidins located in aleurone layer or pericarp, respectively. Other than white seed colour is not natural for common hexaploid wheat but this trait can be introduced from donors by aimed breeding programs. The way of wheat anthocyanins to provide positive effects for consumer´s physiology is limited due to their specific occurrence in seed parts usually removed during grain milling practice and lower stability during processing to food...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 13 {{anthocyanins}} and 33 metabolites; including organic acids, phenolic acids, amino acids, organic compounds, sugar acids, sugar alcohols, and sugars, were profiled in three radish cultivars by using {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) and gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) -based metabolite profiling. Total phenolics and flavonoids and their in vitro antioxidant activities were assessed. <b>Pelargonidins</b> {{were found to be}} the major anthocyanin in the cultivars studied. The cultivar Man Tang Hong showed the highest level of anthocyanins (1. 89 ± 0. 07 mg/g), phenolics (0. 0664 ± 0. 0033 mg/g) and flavonoids (0. 0096 ± 0. 0004 mg/g). Here; the variation of secondary metabolites in the radishes is described, as well as their association with primary metabolites. The low-molecular-weight hydrophilic metabolite profiles were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), Pearson’s correlation analysis. PCA fully distinguished the three radish cultivars tested. The polar metabolites were strongly correlated between metabolites that participate in the TCA cycle. The chemometrics results revealed that TCA cycle intermediates and free phenolic acids as well as anthocyanins were higher in the cultivar Man Tang Hong than in the others. Furthermore; superoxide radical scavenging activities and 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging were investigated to elucidate the antioxidant activity of secondary metabolites in the cultivars. Man Tang Hong showed the highest superoxide radical scavenging activity (68. 87 %) at 1000 μg/mL, and DPPH activity (20. 78 %), followed by Seo Ho and then Hong Feng No. 1. The results demonstrate that GC-TOFMS-based metabolite profiling, integrated with chemometrics, is an applicable method for distinguishing phenotypic variation and determining biochemical reactions connecting primary and secondary metabolism. Therefore; this study might provide information on the relationship between primary and secondary metabolites and a synergistic antioxidant ability derived from the secondary metabolites in the radish cultivars...|$|R

50|$|The pigment giving purple corn its vivid color {{derives from}} an {{exceptional}} {{content of a}} class of polyphenols called anthocyanins. Cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, also called chrysanthemin, is the major anthocyanin in purple corn kernels, comprising about 73% of all anthocyanins present.

50|$|This enzyme is {{involved}} in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.

In the present study, we investigated the occurrence and the kinetics of various circulating <b>pelargonidin</b> metabolites, and we aimed at providing initial information with regard to tissue distribution. Based on HPLC and LC-MS analyses we demonstrate that <b>pelargonidin</b> is absorbed and present in plasma following oral gavage to rats. In addition, the main structurally related <b>pelargonidin</b> metabolite identified in plasma and urine was <b>pelargonidin</b> glucuronide. Furthermore, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, a ring fission product of <b>pelargonidin,</b> was detected in plasma and urine samples obtained at 2 and 18 h after ingestion.

Extraction and isolation of <b>Pelargonidin</b> were carried out by employing liquid-liquid extraction technique, phytochemical tests, column chromatography, UV and FT-IR. In the zebra fish embryo model, Paclitaxel was employed as a negative control. A series of phenotypic changes in different stages of embryonic development were studied with treatment concentrations of <b>Pelargonidin</b> between 3. 0 and 20 ppm at 0 – 72 -hour post-fertilization (hpf). The results of our studies indicate that, after exposure of zebra fish embryos to 3. 3 – 20 ppm concentration of <b>Pelargonidin</b> for 72 h, a significant reduction in aortic development occurs. At the dose level of 0. 5 ppm Paclitaxel and <b>Pelargonidin</b> in the dose range between 3. 3 and 20 ppm, the zebra fish embryos were found to have bent tail, malformed eyes and developmental delays in vasculature. Based on the results obtained, we infer that <b>Pelargonidin</b> can exhibit phenotypic anti-angiogenic variations in embryonic stage of fish embryos and it can be applied in future for exploration of its anti-angiogenic potential.
