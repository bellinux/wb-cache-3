On the one hand they encouraged members of their audiences to join the Omeisha and, on the other hand, members who were employed with the government henceforth explained to the citizenry that they were unable to meet them and instead would publish the notes of their lectures in Omeisha Magazine. Membership soon rose to several hundred and Omeisha also created branches for people outside Tokyo who applied to join.|$|R

He resigned his ministry in Washington state {{with a view to}} travelling to South Africa to assist Rhodes. When Barr reached London, England in January 1902, he was dismayed at news of Rhodes failing health and, two months later, Rhodes died. Barr by now though had first-hand experience with the economic doldrums in England, compounded by thousands of soldiers returning from the War in South Africa with few economic prospects. Barr began an intensive campaign of letter writing and <b>public</b> <b>speaking,</b> urging the <b>people</b> of England to emigrate to Western Canada. As his biographer, Helen Evans Reid, describes it, Barr stressed two opportunities: to “exchange ... the poverty of Britain for an estate in Canada”; and the “chance to build the Empire by planting a colony of pure British culture in the empty territory”.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that video feedback through video self-modelling effectively improves <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> performance; however, results have been inconclusive with respect to its effectiveness in decreasing <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> anxiety. The present study investigated the effects of video feedback on <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> anxiety by implementing a video self-modelling technique in a sample of university students with <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> anxiety. Students with upcoming presentations in their university-level courses were recruited to participate. They completed an online questionnaire measuring state and trait <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> anxiety and were filmed performing a practice version of their upcoming presentation. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental condition, in which they were provided with and were instructed to watch their video prior to their class presentation or a control condition in which they were not provided with a copy of their presentation to watch. After their live presentations in class, participants filled out a final online questionnaire measuring state and trait <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> anxiety. It was hypothesized that all participants would experience a decrease in state and trait <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> anxiety from pre-intervention to post-intervention with the experimental participants experiencing a significant decrease in state and trait anxiety compared to the control participants. Results showed that all participants experienced a decrease in state <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> anxiety from pre-intervention to post-intervention; however no other findings were statistically significant.

40|$|Social phobia is {{an anxiety}} {{disorder}} characterized by heightened fear and avoidance {{of one or}} more social or performance situations, including <b>public</b> <b>speaking,</b> meeting new <b>people,</b> eating or writing in front of others, and attending social gatherings. People with social phobia are typically anxious about the possibility that others will evaluate them negatively and/or notice symptoms of their anxiety. Social phobia affects up to 13 % of individuals at some time in their lives and is usually associated with at least moderate functional impairment. Research on the nature and treatment of social phobia has increased dramatically over the past decade. As with many of the anxiety disorders, sensitive assessment instruments and effective treatments now exist for people suffering from heightened social anxiety. Typical assessment strategies include clinical interviews, behavioural assessments, monitoring diaries, and self-report questionnaires. Treatments with demonstrated efficacy for social phobia include pharmacotherapy (for example, phenelzine, moclobemide, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] medications) and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) (for example, cognitive restructuring, in vivo exposure, social skills training). Although preliminary comparative studies suggest that both approaches are about equally effective in the short term, each approach has advantages and disadvantages over the other. Trials examining combined psychological and pharmacological treatments are now under way, although no published data on the relative efficacy of combined treatments are currently available.

40|$|Ostracism (being {{excluded}} or ignored) {{is experienced}} as unpleasant and distressing. In previous studies, an immediate pre-stress experience of ostracism induced by Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game, {{was found to}} inhibit cortisol reactivity to <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> stress in female students. The present study examines whether the effect will persist when a 15 -minute time gap between the Cyberball experience and subsequent psychological stress is introduced. N= 84 women {{were randomly assigned to}} Cyberball ostracism vs. inclusion. 15 minutes after playing Cyberball, all women were subjected to <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> stress. Salivary cortisol and mood were repeatedly assessed {{during the course of the}} experiment. These are the main findings of the study: Repeated measures ANCOVA revealed that <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> stress resulted in a significant increase of cortisol in both groups (inclusion vs. ostracism). However, cortisol levels were significantly lower in the ostracism group. In earlier studies when Cyberball was played immediately before <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> stress, the cortisol response to <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> was completely suppressed in ostracized women. By introducing a waiting period between Cyberball and <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> stress in the present study, the main effect of an ostracism induced reduction of cortisol remained, although both groups showed an increase of cortisol as a response to <b>public</b> <b>speaking.</b> These results again suggest that the experience of ostracism might inhibit hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, thereby confirming previous results. The formerly observed total suppression of HPA responsiveness to <b>public</b> <b>speaking,</b> however, seems to be a rather short-term effect...|$|R
40|$|Clinically speaking, fear is a phobia and {{the medical}} field has {{identified}} more than 530 phobias that humans suffer from. The fear of <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> has long been ranked as the number one fear of Americans, placing higher than the fear of sickness or death. Within the spectrum of <b>public</b> <b>speaking,</b> many experts believe that improvisational speaking {{is one of the}} most difficult styles of public presentation. Although anxiety caused by the fear of <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> can diminish through tactics and training, this study attempts to demonstrate that a moderate-to-extreme fear of <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> is linked to the condition of Social Phobia. Social Phobia, or Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), is the irrational, yet intense fear of being judged, watched, or ridiculed by others. If an extreme fear of <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> is a Social Phobia, tactics and training alone are not the best remedy for those who suffer from this condition. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the fear of <b>public</b> <b>speaking</b> and Social Phobia.
