40|$|Honeycomb <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> is {{a single}} layer of fabric exhibiting {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) cellular shape on both fabric sides due to the combination of periodic straight yarn floats and partial <b>plain</b> <b>weave.</b> In a <b>fabric</b> <b>weave</b> repeat, the triangle shape of increased yarn floats and crossed diagonal woven lines form two inverted pyramidal spaces on the fabric surfaces and a closed internal space.

The <b>plain</b> <b>woven</b> soil release <b>fabric</b> {{was found to have}} a significantly longer time to second degree burn (4.5  ±  2.1  s) than the twill <b>woven</b> soil release <b>fabric</b> (2.9  ±  1.1  s) (F 3, 95  =  13.27, p ≤  0.001), which was the inverse of the overall effect of fabric type on time to second degree burn. The <b>plain</b> <b>woven</b> soil release <b>fabric</b> also had a significantly lower total absorbed energy for all layers (228.3  ±  15.9  kJ m− 2) than the twill <b>woven</b> soil release <b>fabric</b> (278.2  ±  17.8  kJ m− 2) at the upper sensor (F 3, 96  =  21.94, p ≤  0.001). This significant interaction between fabric type and finish was due to the presence of the soil release finish. Typically the heavier-weight twill-weave fabrics offered better protection against predicted burn injury than <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The soil release finish fabric was the exception to this trend. Soil release finishes applied to the fabric diffuses water under the soil to help remove this soil during laundering (Kissa 1981). The higher absorbed energy found for the twill <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{may be due to the}} nature of the finish as the soil-release finish has the ability to reabsorb and remove soil from the fabric (Kissa 1981). This process of drawing in moisture may be the reason for absorbing more energy. As the twill <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> are heavier and thicker than the <b>plain</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> it is possible that this added effect of absorbing more hot liquid made the twill fabrics store more energy than the plain fabrics.|$|R

40|$|Unidirectional {{laminated}} composites exhibit excellent in-plane properties, {{but poor}} interlaminar properties, {{as there are}} no reinforcements in the thickness direction. This leads to poor damage tolerance and impact resistance when inter-laminar stresses are present. To overcome these problems, <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics</b> are used as reinforcements in composites {{in order to obtain}} balanced ply properties and improved inter-laminar properties. But these advantages are at the cost of reduced stiffness and strength in the in-plane directions.

40|$|Keyword：resin, {{laminated}} composites, temperature, {{tensile strength}} Abstract. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to investigate the tensile property of laminated resin composites reinforced by carbon fiber <b>plain</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> at relatively high temperature. For this purpose, the tensile tests of laminated resin composites are carried out at room temperature(20 °C) and high temperature(150 °C and 180 °C). The effect rules of different temperature on the tensile property of these composites are discussed. The reasons for the variations of tensile property of these composites at different temperature are also analyzed. At 150 °C and 180 °C, the tensile strength of laminated composite decreased by 13. 3 % and 34. 42 % respectively, compared with that at room temperature, which shows that the tensile strength of resin laminated composites is sensitive at high temperature. The reason of the tensile strength of resin laminated composites declined at high temperature is that resin has been damaged and can not transfer tensile load, which makes resin and fiber can not bear the tensile load together at high temperature. The research results will provide a basic reference for the application of <b>plain</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> reinforced resin laminated composites at room temperature to 180 °C...|$|R

The behaviour of reactive dyes on Tencel <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> varies with the type and the density of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric.</b> The highly crystalline Tencel fibre is less easy to dye uniformly by the continuous dyeing methods because of the short time of contact between the dye and fibre. The purpose of this work is to investigate the influences of weave structure on dyeing of standard Tencel fabric using reactive dyes applied by continuous dyeing methods. Programmes are developed using Matlab software to measure the fabric porosity and uniformity of fibre coloration (UFC) in the yarns of the <b>woven</b> <b>fabric.</b> UFC is also measured subjectively. Firstly, fabrics of four different <b>weave</b> structures (<b>plain,</b> 2 / 1, 3 / 1, 5 / 1 twill fabric) are studied. The visual depth and UFC standard deviation values is highest for the 2 / 1 twill fabric, gradually reducing towards the 5 / 1 twill <b>fabric.</b> Secondly, nine <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics</b> of different fabric densities are dyed using different padding procedures - a liquor temperature of 40 ⁰C with a 1 min dwell time and with a 5 min dwell time, and liquor at room temperature without any dwell time. The padded fabrics are then fixed by pad-steam, pad-dry-steam, pad-batch and pad-dry-thermosol continuous dyeing processes. To improve colour depth the <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics</b> are given a caustic pre-treatment and their dyeing characteristics are compared with untreated fabrics.
