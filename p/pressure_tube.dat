25|$|In a {{conventional}} design with a pressurized core, refuelling the system requires the core {{to shut down}} and the pressure vessel to be opened. Due to the arrangement used in CANDU, only the single tube being refuelled needs to be depressurized. This allows the CANDU system to be continually refuelled without shutting down, another major design goal. In modern systems, two robotic machines hook up to the reactor faces and open the end caps of a <b>pressure</b> <b>tube.</b> One machine pushes in the new fuel, whereby the depleted fuel is pushed out and collected at the other end. A significant operational advantage of online refuelling is that a failed or leaking fuel bundle can {{be removed from the}} core once it has been located, thus reducing the radiation levels in the primary cooling loop.|$|E
25|$|A Soviet design, {{built to}} produce {{plutonium}} {{as well as}} power. RBMKs are water cooled with a graphite moderator. RBMKs are in some respects similar to CANDU {{in that they are}} refuelable during power operation and employ a <b>pressure</b> <b>tube</b> design instead of a PWR-style pressure vessel. However, unlike CANDU they are very unstable and large, making containment buildings for them expensive. A series of critical safety flaws have also been identified with the RBMK design, though some of these were corrected following the Chernobyl disaster. Their main attraction is their use of light water and un-enriched uranium. As of 2010, 11 remain open, mostly due to safety improvements and help from international safety agencies such as the DOE. Despite these safety improvements, RBMK reactors are still {{considered one of the most}} dangerous reactor designs in use. RBMK reactors were deployed only in the former Soviet Union.|$|E

50|$|Some reactor designs, such as RBMKs or CANDU reactors, can be refueled {{without being}} shut down. This is {{achieved}} {{through the use}} of many small <b>pressure</b> <b>tubes</b> to contain the fuel and coolant, as opposed to one large pressure vessel as in pressurized water reactor (PWR) or boiling water reactor (BWR) designs. Each tube can be individually isolated and refueled by an operator-controlled fueling machine, typically at a rate of up to 8 channels per day out of roughly 400 in CANDU reactors. On-load refueling allows for the optimal fuel reloading problem to be dealt with continuously, leading to more efficient use of fuel. This increase in efficiency is partially offset by the added complexity of having hundreds of <b>pressure</b> <b>tubes</b> and the fueling machines to service them.|$|R
