He applied to an advanced position in government through court examination. His discourse included ideas from Confucianism, administrative philosophy (Chinese Legalism) and Mohism; namely, that capable <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> employed in positions that match their talents (Mohism and Shen Buhai); secondly, encouraging high standards of morality, harmonious relationships, and employing moral persons (Confucianism and Mohism); and that common people should be allowed opportunity for farming while discouraging useless articles (Mohism and Shang Yang).|$|E
500|$|There was {{not much}} enthusiasm for Morrison and Paltrow's {{performance}} of Prince's [...] "Kiss". BuddyTV's Jen Harper noted that [...] "Holly saved the song" [...] for her. Futterman did not [...] "feel the chemistry" [...] until the final kiss. Benigno, on the other hand, said that the chemistry between them was [...] "palpable", called the cover [...] "pretty great", {{and gave it a}} [...] "B+". Roberts deemed Paltrow's tango rigid, and The Atlantic author Patrick Burns commented that white <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deterred from performing Prince. He called the music [...] "uninteresting and soulless", and was dismayed that the tango was [...] "just white with white people tango dancing". Flandez, however, enjoyed their dancing and wrote, [...] "The strong holds, the slow cuts, the perfect swivel of hips and the lean-to's were mesmerizingly seductive." [...] "Kiss" [...] charted at number eighty-three on Hot 100, and also made number eighty on the Canadian Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|There was {{not much}} enthusiasm for the {{performance}} of [...] "Kiss". Most reviewers were not impressed with Will's falsetto: Harper said it made her ears [...] "sad" [...] and Gonzalez said it [...] "really didn't do it" [...] for her, though she did like the sections in his natural register and gave the performance a [...] "C+", and Harper noted that [...] "Holly saved the song" [...] for her. Although Futterman said Will [...] "expertly hits the falsetto notes", she didn't [...] "feel the chemistry" [...] until the final kiss.

2500|$|White abolitionists did {{not agree}} on how freed <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated. While some {{advocated}} full redistribution of land, others did not support any type of race mixing. Plans for a colony began in 1801 when James Monroe asked President Thomas Jefferson to help create a penal colony for rebellious blacks. The American Colonization Society formed in 1816 {{to address the issue}} of free African Americans through resettlement abroad. By 1860, the ACS had settled thousands of Africans in Liberia. But colonization was slow and unappealing to many, and as mass emancipation loomed there was no clear understanding of what might happen to millions of soon-to-be-free blacks. This issue had long been known to White authorities as [...] "The Negro Problem".|$|E

2500|$|Leftist {{economic}} beliefs {{range from}} Keynesian economics and {{the welfare state}} through industrial democracy and the social market to nationalization {{of the economy and}} central planning, to the anarcho-syndicalist advocacy of a council- and assembly-based self-managed anarchist communism. During the industrial revolution, leftists supported trade unions. At the beginning of the 20th century, many leftists advocated strong government intervention in the economy. Leftists continue to criticize what they perceive as the exploitative nature of globalization, the [...] "race to the bottom" [...] and unjust lay-offs. In {{the last quarter of the}} 20th century, the belief that government (ruling in accordance with the interests of the <b>people)</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> directly involved in the day-to-day workings of an economy declined in popularity amongst the center-left, especially social democrats who became influenced by [...] "Third Way" [...] ideology.|$|E
2500|$|Judge Willis {{frequently}} {{referred to}} the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Aborigines throughout his judgment. He quoted from the testimony before the Committee of William Broughton, the Anglican Bishop of Australia, who was of {{the view that the}} early settlers were wrong to presume that the Aboriginal people were lacking in intellect, that rather their way of life was attributable to their [...] "love of erratic liberty". He also quoted from the submission of the Attorney-General of New South Wales Saxe Bannister, who had argued that the customary laws of the Aboriginal <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> studied and recorded, so that they could be followed and respected by the colonial courts in appropriate cases. From these and other opinions, the Judge concluded, it was evident that the Aboriginal people had their own legal system, and that treaties ought to be made with them.|$|E
2500|$|The Discovery Institute aggressively {{promotes}} its Teach the Controversy {{campaign and}} intelligent design to the public, education officials and public policymakers. Its efforts are largely aimed at conservative Christian policymakers, {{where it is}} cast as a counterbalance to the liberal influences of [...] "atheistic scientists" [...] and [...] "Dogmatic Darwinists." [...] As a measure of their success in this effort, on 1 August 2005, during a round-table interview with reporters from five Texas newspapers, President Bush said that he believes schools should discuss intelligent design alongside evolution when teaching students {{about the origin of}} life. Bush, a conservative Christian, declined to go into detail on his personal views of the origin of life, but advocated the Teach the Controversy approach - [...] "I think that part of education is to expose people to different schools of thought... you're asking me whether or not <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exposed to different ideas, the answer is yes." [...] Christian conservatives, a substantial part of Bush's voting base, have been central in promoting the Teach the Controversy campaign.|$|E
50|$|Ross {{rejected}} Moore's consequentialist ethics. According to consequentialist theories, what <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do <b>is</b> determined only by {{whether their}} actions {{will bring about}} the most good.

50|$|Properly speaking, the <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> {{accustomed}} <b>to</b> {{the fact}} that the French government did not fulfill its financial obligations, for since the time of Henry IV, that is, within two centuries, it had failed to meet its obligations fifty-six times. In earlier days such catastrophes had not been announced and publicly discussed. Now all France, which for two generations had been worked upon by the party of rationalism, shared the outcry against the financial situation.|$|R
60|$|If, however, I <b>were</b> asked <b>to</b> give an advice {{merely as}} such, {{here are my}} ideas. I am not for a total indemnity, nor a general punishment. And first, the body and mass of the <b>people</b> never <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated as criminal. They may become an object of more or less {{constant}} watchfulness and suspicion, as their preservation may best require, but they can never become an object of punishment.

60|$|A free <b>people</b> <b>ought</b> {{not only}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and {{interest}} require {{that they should}} promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies.|$|R
