In this study, we evaluated the cell death mechanism induced by <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatments</b> with two photosensitizers, meso-tetrakis (4 -carboxyphenyl) porphyrin sodium salt (Na-H 2 TCPP) and its zinc derivative Na-ZnTCPP, in two human breast epithelial cell lines, a non-tumoral (MCF- 10 A) and a tumoral one (SKBR- 3). Viability assays showed that <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatments</b> with both photosensitizers induced a reduction in cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner and no dark toxicity was observed. The cell death mechanisms triggered were evaluated by several assays and cell line-dependent results were found. Most SKBR- 3 cells died by either necrosis or apoptosis. By contrast, in MCF- 10 A cells, necrotic cells and another cell population with characteristics of both necrosis and apoptosis were predominant.

Pre{{treatment of}} erythrocytes with 4, 4 '-di-isothiocyano- 2, 2 '-stilbenedisulphonate, chymotrypsin or chlorpromazine caused a potentiation of subsequent heat-induced K+ leakage. <b>Photodynamic</b> <b>treatment</b> of erythrocytes with Photofrin II, eosin isothiocyanate or a porphyrin-Cu 2 + complex as sensitizer also induced an increase in passive cation permeability, ultimately resulting in colloid osmotic haemolysis.

Analysis of the results by the Arrhenius equation revealed that both the activation energy and the frequency factor of heat-induced K+ leakage were decreased significantly by preceding <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatment,</b> suggesting that hyperthermia and <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatment</b> have a common target for the induction of K+ leakage. Several lines of reasoning indicate that this common target is band 3.

On the other hand, photodynamic inactivation of the enzyme (induced by illumination in the presence of Photofrin II) was caused by photo-oxidation of the essential thiol group in the active centre. A short <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatment</b> of the enzyme, leading to only a limited inactivation, caused a pronounced potentiation of subsequent thermal inactivation, as measured over the temperature range 40 - 50 degrees C. Analysis of the experimental results according to the Arrhenius equation revealed that both the activation energy of thermal inactivation and the frequency factor (the proportionality constant) were significantly decreased by the preceding <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatment.</b> The experimental results indicate a mechanism in which limited <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatment</b> induced a conformational change of the protein molecule. This conformational change did not contribute to photodynamic enzyme inhibition, but was responsible for the decreased frequency factor and activation energy of subsequent thermal inactivation of the enzyme. The opposing effects of decreased activation energy and decreased frequency factor resulted in potentiation of thermal inactivation of the enzyme over the temperature range 40 - 50 degrees C. With other proteins, different results were obtained. With amylase the combined photodynamic and thermal effects were not synergistic, but additive, and <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatment</b> had no effect on the frequency factor and the activation energy of thermal inactivation.

In this study it was investigated whether <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatment</b> of human RBCs (meant to inactivate contaminating pathogens) affects deformability STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: WBC-reduced RBC suspensions (30 % Hct) were treated with 1, 9 -dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) and red light. Changes in deformability were analyzed by LORCA measurements, in which elongation of the cells is measured at increasing shear stress. The effect of DMMB concentration and light dose was determined {{as well as the}} interfering effect of two scavengers of reactive oxygen species, that is, dipyridamole and Trolox. RESULTS: <b>Photodynamic</b> <b>treatment</b> with DMMB resulted in clear changes in RBC deformability. Deformability changes occurred before onset of hemolysis. Under relatively mild treatment conditions, especially deformability at low shear stress was decreased, whereas deformability changes at high shear stress only occurred under harsher treatment conditions. Inclusion of dipyridamole and/or Trolox primarily prevented deformability changes at high shear stress. CONCLUSION: LORCA measurements can effectively be used to detect changes in deformability that are induced by <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatment</b> of human RBCs.

APDT with each PS killed efficiently both the quiescent ungerminated microconidia and metabolically active germinated microconidia of the three Fusarium species.

Lysosomes stained with acridine orange in rat and human astrocytes exploded under laser illumination [30], and acridine orange stained lysosomes in human fibroblasts ruptured under intense illumination [31]. We have observed the explosion of autofluorescent lysosomes (containing lipofuscin pigments ("aging pigments") [32]) in adult/aging C. elegans under intense UV (360 ± 20 nm) illumination (Additional File 1 Figure S 11; Additional File 9), suggesting that similar phenomena might occur in a variety of cells and animal models. Additionally, studies on photodynamic therapy have revealed that certain photosensitizers accumulate in lysosomes and can cause lysosome rupture and release of lysosomal enzymes during <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatments,</b> leading to cell necrosis [33]. Most current models suggest that either temperature increase or the oxidation of lysosome membranes leads to lysosome rupture [34]. Our study of the in vitro exploding vesicle system suggests another possible mechanism for oxidative stress induced lysosome rupture: oxidation of lysosomal internal solutes (such as peptides and amino acids) leading to increased osmotic pressure and ultimately membrane rupture. Future experiments to analyze lysosomal internal solutes and to address how their oxidation may increase the internal osmolarity of lysosomes may help to elucidate the mechanism of oxidative stress induced lysosome rupture.|$|R

In addition to hematoporphyrin-based drugs, 2 nd generation PSs with better photochemical properties are now studied using cell cultures, experimental tumors and clinical trials. Porphycene is a structural isomer of porphyrin and constitutes an interesting new class of PS. Porphycene derivatives show higher absorption than porphyrins in the red spectral region (lλ > 600 nm, η > 50000 M- 1 ·cm- 1) owing to the lower molecular symmetry.

Thus far, the underlying mechanisms of PDT regarding cellular responses and gene regulation are poorly understood. Photochemically generated singlet oxygen (1 O 2) is mainly responsible for cytotoxicity induced by PDT. If targeted cells are not disintegrated, photo-oxidative stress leads to transcription and translation of various stress response and cytokine genes. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, interleukin (IL) 1 and IL- 6 are strongly induced by <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatment,</b> supporting inflammatory action and immunological anti-tumour responses. To investigate the first steps of gene activation, this study focused on the proto-oncogenes c-jun and c-fos, both coding for the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP- 1), which was found to mediate IL- 6 gene expression.

Expression of the c-jun and c-fos genes was determined by way of Northern blot analysis, and DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor AP- 1 was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Photofrin-mediated photosensitisation of HeLa cells resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent induction of both genes but preferential expression of c-jun. Compared with the transient expression of c-jun and c-fos by phorbol ester stimulation, <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatment</b> led to a prolonged activation pattern of both immediate early genes. Furthermore, mRNA stability studies revealed an increased half-life of c-jun and c-fos transcripts resulting from photosensitisation. Although mRNA accumulation after PDT was stronger and more prolonged compared with phorbol ester stimulation, with regard to AP- 1 DNA-binding activity, phorbol ester was more efficient. Surprisingly, in addition to the activation of AP- 1 DNA-binding via PDT, <b>photodynamic</b> <b>treatment</b> can decrease AP- 1 DNA-binding of other strong inducers, such as the protein kinase C-mediated pathway of phorbol esters and the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC).
