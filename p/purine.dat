5|$|Thermal {{disruption}} at {{elevated temperature}} increases {{the rate of}} depurination (loss of <b>purine</b> bases from the DNA backbone) and single-strand breaks. For example, hydrolytic depurination {{is seen in the}} thermophilic bacteria, which grow in hot springs at 40–80°C. The rate of depurination (300 <b>purine</b> residues per genome per generation) is too high in these species to be repaired by normal repair machinery, hence a possibility of an adaptive response cannot be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Though {{molybdenum}} forms compounds {{with various}} organic molecules, including carbohydrates and amino acids, it is transported throughout {{the human body}} as MoO42−. At least 50 molybdenum-containing enzymes were known by 2002, mostly in bacteria, and the number is increasing with every year; those enzymes include aldehyde oxidase, sulfite oxidase and xanthine oxidase. In some animals, and in humans, the oxidation of xanthine to uric acid, a process of <b>purine</b> catabolism, is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, a molybdenum-containing enzyme. The activity of xanthine oxidase is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} molybdenum in the body. However, an extremely high concentration of molybdenum reverses the trend and can act as an inhibitor in both <b>purine</b> catabolism and other processes. Molybdenum concentration also affects protein synthesis, metabolism, and growth.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experimental}} treatments {{have shown}} promise in animal models. These include inhibitors of oxidosqualene cyclase and squalene synthase, cysteine protease inhibitors, dermaseptins collected from frogs in the genus Phyllomedusa (P. oreades and P. distincta), the sesquiterpene lactone dehydroleucodine (DhL), which affects {{the growth of}} cultured epimastigote-phase Trypanosoma cruzi, inhibitors of <b>purine</b> uptake, and inhibitors of enzymes involved in trypanothione metabolism. Hopefully, new drug targets may be revealed following the sequencing of the T. cruzi genome.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In this study, 6 -chloropurines with varied substituents in the 2 and 9 or 7 {{positions}} were functionalized in the 8 -position. This was done via lithiation and subsequent bromination to form 8 -brominated <b>purines.</b> It was observed that lithiation/bromination of N- 9 benzylated <b>purines</b> bearing electron donating substituents on the phenyl ring gave good conversions and excellent yields {{of the expected}} 8 -bromo <b>purines.</b> On the other hand, those bearing electron withdrawing groups on the phenyl ring gave poor conversions and yields of the expected 8 -bromo <b>purines.</b> Aside the expected 8 -bromo <b>purines,</b> dimers and aldehydes were observed as by-products of this reaction...|$|R

5|$|The central {{pathways}} of metabolism described above, such as glycolysis and the {{citric acid}} cycle, {{are present in}} all three domains of living things and {{were present in the}} last universal common ancestor. This universal ancestral cell was prokaryotic and probably a methanogen that had extensive amino acid, nucleotide, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The retention of these ancient pathways during later evolution {{may be the result of}} these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps. The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of <b>purine</b> nucleotide metabolism, while previous metabolic pathways were a part of the ancient RNA world.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Amanita exitialis contain a unique <b>purine</b> {{nucleoside}} that is {{coupled with an}} amino acid derivative named N2-(1-methoxycarbonylethyl)guanosine. The discovery and identification of this chemical was the first report of a naturally occurring nucleoside in which an amino acid derivative is bonded through its α-amino nitrogen (the nitrogen bonded to the α-carbon) to a nucleobase aglycone by a C-N (carbon to nitrogen) bond. The new compound {{was determined to be}} toxic in the brine shrimp lethality test, but it did not have cytotoxic activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines. Other compounds isolated from the fungus include β-carboline and russulaceramide (a ceramide formerly found in some Russula mushrooms).|$|E
5|$|Since a {{large number}} of oxidoreductases use NAD and NADH as substrates, and bind them using a highly conserved {{structural}} motif, the idea that inhibitors based on NAD could be specific to one enzyme is surprising. However, this can be possible: for example, inhibitors based on the compounds mycophenolic acid and tiazofurin inhibit IMP dehydrogenase at the NAD binding site. Because of the importance of this enzyme in <b>purine</b> metabolism, these compounds may be useful as anti-cancer, anti-viral, or immunosuppressive drugs. Other drugs are not enzyme inhibitors, but instead activate enzymes involved in NAD metabolism. Sirtuins are a particularly interesting target for such drugs, since activation of these NAD-dependent deacetylases extends lifespan. Compounds such as resveratrol increase the activity of these enzymes, which may be important in their ability to delay aging in both vertebrate, and invertebrate model organisms.|$|E
40|$|Extracellular <b>purines</b> {{have a role}} in renal {{physiology}} and adaption to inflammation. However, inflammatory renal disease may be mediated by extracellular <b>purines,</b> resulting in renal injury. The role of purinergic signaling is dependent on the concentrations of extracellular <b>purines.</b> Low basal levels of <b>purines</b> are important in normal homeostasis and growth. Concentrations of extracellular <b>purines</b> are significantly elevated during inflammation and mediate either an adaptive role or propagate local inflammation. Adenosine signaling mediates alterations in regional renal blood flow by regulation of the renal microcirculation, tubulo-glomerular feedback, and tubular transport of sodium and water. Increased extracellular ATP and renal P 2 receptor-mediated inflammation are associated with various renal diseases, including hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, and glomerulonephritis. Experimental data suggests P 2 receptor deficiency or receptor antagonism is associated with amelioration of antibody-mediated nephritis, suggesting a pathogenic (rather than adaptive) role of purinergic signaling. We discuss the role of extracellular nucleotides in adaptation to ischemic renal injury and in the pathogenesis of inflammatory renal disease...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} extracellular <b>purines</b> and pain perception in humans. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of <b>purines</b> and their metabolites were compared between patients displaying acute and/or chronic pain syndromes and control subjects. The CSF levels of IMP, inosine, guanosine and uric acid were significantly increased in the chronic pain group and correlated with pain severity (P< 0. 05). Patients displaying both chronic and acute pain presented similar changes in the CSF <b>purines</b> concentration (P< 0. 05). However, in the acute pain group, only CSF inosine and uric acid levels were significantly increased (P< 0. 05). These findings suggest that <b>purines,</b> in special inosine, guanosine and uric acid, {{are associated with the}} spinal mechanisms underlying nociception. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

25|$|Substitution mutations, often {{caused by}} {{chemicals}} or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another. These changes {{are classified as}} transitions or transversions. Most common is the transition that exchanges a <b>purine</b> for a <b>purine</b> (A ↔ G) or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine, (C ↔ T). A transition {{can be caused by}} nitrous acid, base mis-pairing, or mutagenic base analogs such as BrdU. Less common is a transversion, which exchanges a <b>purine</b> for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a <b>purine</b> (C/T ↔ A/G). An example of a transversion is the conversion of adenine (A) into a cytosine (C). A point mutation are modifications of single base pairs of DNA or other small base pairs within a gene. A point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation, in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality).|$|E
