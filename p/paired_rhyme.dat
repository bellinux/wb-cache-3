5000|$|Ayyuqi (عیوقی) was a 10th-century Persian poet. A {{contemporary}} of Mahmud of Ghazni, {{he wrote}} the epic Varqa u Gulshāh (...) in 2,250 verses, story of the love between a youth named Varqa and a maiden, Golshah. According to the poet himself, the story {{is based on the}} Arabic work ‘Orwa wa ‘Afra. The work survives in a unique manuscript at Istanbul (in picture). He also wrote some qasidas. No reliable information about Ayyuqi has come down. His works are characterized by <b>paired</b> <b>rhyme</b> interspersed with ghazal.|$|E
50|$|Rhyme was {{introduced}} into Russian poetry in the 18th century. Folk poetry had generally been unrhymed, relying more on dactylic line endings for effect. Rhyme {{depends on a}} vowel and adjacent consonant (which may include the semivowel Short I). Vowel <b>pairs</b> <b>rhyme</b> - even though non-Russian speakers may not perceive them as the same sound. Consonant <b>pairs</b> <b>rhyme</b> if both are devoiced. Early 18th century poetry demanded perfect rhymes that were also grammatical rhymes—namely that noun endings rhymed with noun endings, verb endings with verb endings, and so on. Such rhymes relying on morphological endings become much rarer in modern Russian poetry, and greater use is made of approximate rhymes.|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} how event-related electrical {{activity in the}} brain relates to cognitive functioning {{in a group of}} 27 normally aging females (68 - 73 years of age), participants were separated into high and low groups based on their performance on cognitive measures of three domains: Verbal working memory; Immediate auditory recall; and Inhibition. The aim {{of the study was to}} expand our understanding of language processing in normal aging, and to characterize how neural indices mediating phonologic processing are related to inhibitory and working memory abilities in healthy, elderly women. Participants were challenged with a visual word <b>pair</b> <b>rhyme</b> judgment task, from which eventrelated brain potentials, reaction time, and accuracy were recorded. Consisting of a prime and target, <b>rhyming</b> word <b>pairs</b> (orthographically congruent: THROWN-OWN and incongruent: CONE-OWN) and non-rhyming word pairs (orthographically congruent: GOWN-OWN, and incongruent: CAKE-OWN) were used. Verbal Working Memory: High performers were distinguished from low performers on both reaction time and accuracy. High performers also distinguished themselves electrophysiologically by an increased amplitude contingent negative variation, a working memory indicator, and by displaying earlier N 100 peak latencies, an indicator of early cortical visual processing. Immediate Auditory Recall: Reaction time and accuracy were similar for low and high performers, although high performers displayed an increased N 400, the component elicited by the rhyme judgment stimuli. High performers displayed increased rhyme effect mean amplitudes, which are believed to reflect processes underlying the ability to determine whether or not congruent <b>pairs</b> <b>rhyme.</b> Inhibition: High performers displayed faster reaction times and greater accuracy. Additionally, high performers displayed earlier N 100 peak latencies under congruent conditions, which was significant over the left hemisphere in incongruent conditions. Lastly, high performers exhibited increased amplitude “later” rhyme effects for incongruent conditions when compared to low performers. In summary, the results of this study clearly demonstrate that differences in behavioral and cognitive abilities mediating verbal working memory, immediate auditory recall, and inhibition predict neural functions for language processing in the elderly, hinting at future opportunities for developing new biomarkers of successful aging. ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 137). Bangladeshi EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners, very naturally, {{are expected}} to face problems in pronouncing certain phonemes of English since English is a stress-timed language as opposed to Bangla which is a syllable-timed language. Besides these, {{there are plenty of}} factors that are responsible for causing difficulties for Bangladeshi EFL learners in pronouncing specific phonemes of English like fricatives, affricates, diphthongs etc. The objective {{of this paper is to}} find out Bangladeshi EFL learners‘ pronunciation difficulties so that we can devise some strategies to teach them the correct pronunciations. The characteristic differences between the sound patterns of Bangla and English language cause further difficulties for Bangladeshi EFL learners. Some hypotheses are formulated stating the difficulties that Bangladeshi EFL learners might face in pronouncing complex phonemes of English. This study is divided into two parts: segmental elements and supra segmental features. Bangladeshi learners have most problems in pronouncing the fricatives, affricates, diphthongs and vowels. They cannot speak English with proper accent and many aspects of connected speech are also absent in their speech. To reduce these problems, some solutions are suggested here: teachers can devise some tongue twisters, mnemonics, minimal <b>pairs,</b> <b>rhymes</b> to minimize the pronunciation difficulties faced by Bangladeshi EFL learners.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} examined phonological priming {{effects on}} reaction times, error rates, and event-related brain potential (ERP) measures in an auditory lexical decision task. In Experiment 1 related prime-target <b>pairs</b> <b>rhymed,</b> and in Experiment 2 they alliterated (i. e., shared the consonantal onset and vowel). Event-related potentials {{were recorded in}} a delayed response task. Reaction times and error rates were obtained both for the delayed and an immediate response task. The behavioral data of Experiment 1 provided evidence for phonological facilitation of word, but not of nonword decisions. The brain potentials were more negative to unrelated than to <b>rhyming</b> word-word <b>pairs</b> between 450 and 700 msec after target onset. This negative enhancement was not present for word-nonword pairs. Thus, the ERP results match the behavioral data. The behavioral data of Experiment 2 provided no evidence for phonological Facilitation. However, between 250 and 450 msec after target onset, i. e., considerably earlier than in Experiment 1, brain potentials were more negative for unrelated than for alliterating word and word-nonword pairs. It is argued that the ERP effects in the two experiments could be modulations of the same underlying component, possibly the N 400. The difference in {{the timing of the}} effects is likely to be {{due to the fact that}} the shared segments in related stimulus pairs appeared in different word positions in the two experiments...|$|R

40|$|Postlingually {{acquired}} {{hearing impairment}} (HI) {{is associated with}} changes in the representation of sound in semantic long-term memory. An indication {{of this is the}} lower performance on visual rhyme judgment tasks in conditions where phonological and orthographic cues mismatch, requiring high reliance on phonological representations. In this study, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used {{for the first time to}} investigate the neural correlates of phonological processing in visual rhyme judgments in participants with acquired HI and normal hearing (NH). <b>Rhyme</b> task word <b>pairs</b> <b>rhymed</b> or not and had matching or mismatching orthography. In addition, the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) was manipulated to be either long (800 ms) or short (50 ms). Long ISIs allow for engagement of explicit, top-down processes, while short ISIs limit the involvement of such mechanisms. We hypothesized lower behavioral performance and N 400 and N 2 deviations in HI in the mismatching rhyme judgment conditions, particularly in short ISI. However, the results showed a different pattern. As expected, behavioral performance in the mismatch conditions was lower in HI than in NH in short ISI, but ERPs did not differ across groups. In contrast, HI performed on a par with NH in long ISI. Further, HI, but not NH, showed an amplified N 2 -like response in the non-rhyming, orthographically mismatching condition in long ISI. This was also the rhyme condition in which participants in both groups benefited the most from the possibility to engage top-down processes afforded with the longer ISI. Taken together, these results indicate an early ERP signature of HI in this challenging phonological task, likely reflecting use of a compensatory strategy. This strategy is suggested to involve increased reliance on explicit mechanisms such as articulatory recoding and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion...|$|R
