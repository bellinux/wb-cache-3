60|$|This {{custom of}} an annual {{property}} probably continued amongst the Germans {{as long as}} they remained in their own country; but when their conquests carried them into other parts, another object besides the possession of the land arose, which obliged them to make a change in this particular. In the distribution of the conquered lands, the ancient possessors of them became an object of consideration, and the management of these became one of the principal branches of their polity. It was expedient towards holding them in perfect subjection, that they should be habituated to obey one person, and that a kind of cliental relation should be created between them; therefore the land, with the slaves, and the people in a state next to slavery, annexed to it, was bestowed for life in the general distribution. When life-estates were once granted, it seemed a natural consequence that inheritances should immediately supervene. When a durable connection is created between a certain man and a certain portion of land by a possession for his whole life, and when his children have grown up and have been supported on that land, it seems so great an hardship to separate them, and to deprive thereby the family of all means of subsisting, that nothing could be more generally desired nor more reasonably allowed than an inheritance; and this reasonableness was strongly enforced by the great change wrought in their affairs when life-estates were granted. Whilst according to the ancient custom lands were only given for a year, there was a rotation so quick that every family came in its turn to be easily provided for, and had not long to wait; but the children of a tenant for life, when they lost the benefit of their father's possession, saw themselves as it were immured upon every side by the life-estates, and perceived no reasonable hope of a provision from any new arrangement. These inheritances began very early in England. By a law of King Alfred it appears that they were then of a very ancient establishment: and as such inheritances were intended for great stability, they fortified them by charters; and therefore they were called Book-land. This was done with regard to the possession of the better sort: the meaner, who were called ceorles, if they did not live in a dependence on some thane, held their small portions of land as an inheritance likewise,--not by charter, but by a sort of prescription. This was called Folk-land. These estates of inheritance, both the greater and the meaner, were not fiefs; they were to all purposes allodial, and had hardly a single property of a feud; they descended equally to all the children, males and females, according to the custom of gavelkind, a custom absolutely contrary to the genius of the feudal tenure; and whenever estates were granted in the later Saxon times by the bounty of the crown with an intent that they should be inheritable, so far were they from being granted with the complicated load of all the feudal services annexed, that in all the charters of that kind which subsist they are bestowed with a full <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> et liberi ab omni seculari gravamine. This was the general condition of those inheritances which were derived from the right of original conquest, as well to all the soldiers as to the leader; and these estates, as it is said, were not even forfeitable, no, not for felony, as if that were in some sort the necessary consequence of an inheritable estate. So far were they from resembling a fief. But there were other possessions which bore a nearer resemblance to fiefs, at least in their first feeble and infantile state of the tenure, than, those inheritances which were held by an absolute right in the proprietor. The great officers who attended the court, commanded armies, or distributed justice must necessarily be paid and supported; but in what manner could they be paid? In money they could not, because there was very little money then in Europe, and scarce any part of that little came into the prince's coffers. The only method of paying them was by allotting lands for their subsistence whilst they remained in his service. For this reason, in the original distribution, vast tracts of land were left {{in the hands of the}} king. If any served the king in a military command, his land may be said to have been in some sort held by knight-service. If the tenant was in an office about the king's person, this gave rise to sergeantry; the persons who cultivated his lands may be considered as holding by socage. But the long train of services that made afterwards the learning of the tenures were then not thought of, because these feuds, if we may so call them, had not then come to be inheritances,--which circumstance of inheritance gave rise to the whole feudal system. With the Anglo-Saxons the feuds continued to the last but a sort of pay or salary of office. The trinoda necessitas, so much spoken of, which was to attend the king in his expeditions, and to contribute to the building of bridges and repair of highways, never bound the lands by way of tenure, but as a political regulation, which equally affected every class and condition of men and every species of possession.|$|E

50|$|There {{were three}} types of grants in the Chenab Colony, namely peasant, yeoman and {{capitalist}} grants. Peasants had to remain as tenants {{of the government and}} could not acquire proprietary rights. This was designed to curtail the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> peasant grantees. Yeoman and capitalist grantees were allowed to acquire proprietary rights after a five-year qualification period. Upon acquiring the grants, the yeoman and capitalist grantees were required to pay a fee to the government in lieu of the size of their holdings. Peasant and yeoman grantees were required to be resident on the land. 78.3 per cent of the total land in the colony was allotted to peasant grantees. The Yeomen could belong only to the landholding agricultural classes, and they were to be drawn from small and middle level landlords. The capitalist grants were intended for men whom the government wished to reward for rendering political, administrative or military services. They were also intended for individuals with capital, who would invest in improved farming and thereby raise the standard of agriculture in the colony.|$|R

In eastern Brittany {{in the ninth}} century {{there is plenty of}} evidence that two degrees of kinship (the descendants of a common grandfather) were often involved in the transmission of landed property. Siblings and cousins, however, might argue over use of the family land and sometimes a share-out ensued. Further, the small number of cases of sales from husbands to wives seem to have taken place to secure free <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> Permanent division <b>of</b> the family land became more common {{over the course of the}} ninth century and it looks as if family control of family units was fragmenting.

5000|$|At {{common law}} a {{feoffment}} in fee did not originally pass an {{estate in the}} sense in which the term is now understood. The purchaser took only a usufructary interest, without the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in prejudice of the lord. In default of heirs, the tenure became extinct and the land reverted to the lord. Under the system of English feudal tenures, all lands in the Kingdom, were supposed to be holden mediately or immediately of the King who was styled the [...] "lord paramount", or above all. Such tenants as held under the King immediately, when they granted out portions of their lands to inferior persons, also became lords with respect to those inferior persons, since they were still tenants with respect to the King, and thus partaking of a middle nature were called [...] "mesne" [...] or [...] "middle lords". So, if the King granted a manor to A and A granted a portion of the land to B, now B was said to hold of A, and A of the King; or in other words, B held his lands immediately of A and mediately of the King. The King was therefore styled [...] "Lord Paramount"; A was both tenant and lord, or a mesne lord, and B was called [...] "tenant paravail", or the lowest tenant. Out of the feudal tenures or holdings sprung certain rights and incidents, among those which were fealty and escheat. Both these were incidents of socage tenure. Fealty is the obligation of fidelty which the tenant owed to the lord. Escheat was the reversion of the estate on a grant in fee simple upon a failure of the heirs of the owner. Fealty was annexed to and attendant on the reversion. They were inseparable. These incidents of feudal tenure belonged to the lord of whome the lands were immediately holden, that is to say, to him of whom the owner for the time being purchased. These grants were called subinfeudations.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} {{difference between the}} military and socage tenures was the mode of descent. Whether or not a feudal benefice was originally hereditary, it had certainly become so {{at the time of the}} Conquest, and it descended to the eldest son. This applied at once in England to land held by knight-service as far as regarded the capital fief. The descent of socage lands or lands other than the capital fief for some time followed the old pre-Conquest rule of descent. Thus in the so-called [...] "Laws of Henry I" [...] The lands other than the capital fief and some socage lands were divided among all the sons equally. But by the time of Henry de Bracton the course of descent of lands held by knight-service had so far prevailed that, though it was a question of fact whether the land was partible or not, if there was no evidence either way descent to the eldest son was presumed. Relics of the old custom still remain in the case of gavelkind. The military tenant was subject to the feudal incidents, from which the tenant in socage was exempt. These additional fees and obligations were often oppressive. Alienation of lands by will, except in a few favoured districts, became impossible; alienation inter vivos was restrained in one direction in the interests of the heir, in another in the interests of the lord. At the time of Glanvill a tenant had a greater <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> over land which he had purchased than over land which he had inherited. But by the time of Bracton the heir had ceased to have any interest in either kind of land. The lords were more successful. It was enacted by Magna Carta that a free man should not give or sell so much of his land as to leave an amount insufficient to perform his services to his lord. In spite of this provision, the rights of the lords were continually diminished by subinfeudation until the passing of the Statute of Quia Emptores. Alienation by a tenant-in-chief of the crown without licence was a ground of forfeiture until 1327, when a fine was substituted.|$|E
40|$|This Article {{provides}} an overview of the land regimes that the peoples of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Israel created by law and custom between 3000 B. C. and 500 B. C. One purpose of the endeavor is narrowly pedagogic. In the United States, students who enroll in courses on property law traditionally have found the history of land law treated in highly stylized fashion. The leading casebooks begin their historical accounts with the Norman Conquest of 1066, sketch the English land regime under high feudalism, and then chronicle the developments over the ensuing centuries, particularly the weakening of the crown and the rise of a landowner 2 ̆ 7 s <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> Because English legal history is more directly relevant to an Anglo-American lawyer than any other remote history, some emphasis on these events is entirely appropriate. The shortcoming of this pedagogic tradition, however, is that the English struggles are presented as if they are without parallel. This is highly misleading. This Article demonstrates that the peoples of the ancient Near East grappled with comparable issues some 3, 000 years before the English Normans did.

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent a husband from co-ercing his wife into {{transferring}} her separate estate to him, {{in the late eighteenth}} century Lord Thurlow created an exception to the general rule that equity declares void any attempt to impose a direct restraint upon a disponee's <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> Henceforth a practice developed whereby property transferred for the separate use of a married woman was given "without <b>power</b> <b>of</b> anticipation", although a similarly worded limitation would suffice. The married woman was thereby disabled during coverture from alienating the property or anticipating its future income. Just as the restraint protected the wife against a predatory husband, it also operated against her creditors. While she could devise or bequeath the property in question, she could neither sell nor mortgage it, not could her creditors claim it in satisfaction of any debts she might have owed them. Courts of equity had no jurisdiction to override or modify a particular restraint on alienation in the interests of the married woman who was subject to it. Because of the basic economic changes caused by the Industrial Revolution with its attendant specialisation of the labour and concentration of production in factories, society also changed. It became more mobile and more urbanized and many wives gained employment in the new factories. Very little production was now carried out in the home and the husband, away-at work for long periods, found that his power position in the family was weakened. Since changes in the family had economic causes, these were most likely to be reflected in that field of the law most closely tied to the economy, that is, property. As the wife began to receive income (and in some cases, accumulate property), reform of the common law doctrine of coverture was imperative. Well-to-do women could enjoy the benefits of property drafted marriage settlements incorporating the equitable notions of separate estate and restraints on anticipation, but poorer women lacked these advantages and, to the extent that they had assets, they suffered the full rigours of the common law...|$|R

40|$|In the {{contemporary}} concepts <b>of</b> the world, <b>alienation</b> {{is starting to}} become a more and more interesting topic, equally so to the science, art, philosophy, politics and theology. Some authors claim the alienation to be the synonym {{for the state of}} mind {{the contemporary}} man. A strong interest in the problems <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> as expressed by the recent ideas is accompanied by the emergence of a great variety of interpretations of this concept. Dean Dwight assessed thirteen possible correlates <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> It is not unusual, as in the new considerations <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> many influences from the near and far tradition are present, as well as the results of the new original research and thinking. Besides, as the problem <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> is not interesting exclusively to the philosophy, from various fields new solutions and different concepts are coming. All this makes modern discussion on alienation not only more complex, but more interesting at the same time. Starting from the fact that alienation is many-faceted phenomenon, the sociologist tried to assess its main qualifications. These efforts resulted in the well known systematization of the meanings <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> given by D. Dwight, M. Seeman, J. P. Clark and others. Contemporary sociology gives other solutions too. Especially promising is the recognition of the general characteristic of the modern concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> revealed through the comparison with the traditional concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> as a whole, The traditional theory is dominated by the concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> which gets the meaning {{in the context of the}} global society and the history as a whole.

Simultaneously, alienation acquires mostly pejorative meanings, representing deprivation, loss, disconnection, estrangement and so on. Even the interpretations of some significant traditional theories on alienation have quite another, contemporary significance in modern analyses. (Hegel’s concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> as a lack <b>of</b> <b>power.)</b> In relation to the traditional one, the contemporary concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> emerges as an unique thesis, stressing mainly negative and predominantly psychological aspects of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>alienation...</b>|$|R

40|$|The extreme {{concepts}} {{in the theory}} <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> have been analysed in this paper. Such concepts can be found both in the traditional {{as well as in}} the contemporary theories. The phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> considered from the global and from the predominantly positive aspects, characterizes the traditional theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> In Hegel 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy such a concept becomes expressed as an extreme. Hegel is interested in the general situation, in logic, and in evolution of the historical process; the historical process itself is happening by means <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> in other words, by means of changing the passions (partial interests and activities) into idea and intellect (general, common, social contents). Hegel does not seem to be interested in the problems of an individual, such problems being of no interest at his time after all, for the liberal capitalism does not produce the problematic but self-confident and strong personalities. Hegel is not aware of the destructive, self-destructive moments in the process <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> Consequently, the alienation becomes exclusively positive process for Hegel, it becomes a specific process of the human self-creation in the history. The individual side of the problem <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> has been worked out in more detail with Marx. With Marx as well as with Lenin the destructive side of the negativism, building not only the history but also representing a great danger for the human existence, has been rather emphasized. In this way the extreme of Hegel 2 ̆ 7 s concept has been lessened. On the other hand, in the contemporary theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> there is a collision between the extreme and complete concepts. Different from the traditional theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> the contemporary concept emphasizes, on the whole, the individual and negative aspects <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> In the philosophy of existentialism such a concept has been expressed to an extreme. Quite different from such an extreme term, a lot of modern authors have been pointing out the drawbacks and extremes in the contemporary concepts, (e. g. L. Feuer’s criticism) and they have been trying to realize the complete approaches to the question <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> This question particularly becomes explicit in the works of E. Fromm and W. Mills. Thus some definite contours of the complete approaches as well as the criticism of the extreme concepts <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> can be traced both in the traditional and contemporary theories. From what has been said about the question <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> by now, it becomes evident that its complete research must include the global and the individual, the positive and the negative aspects of the problem at the same time. As an example of such an approach, the isolation and the lack <b>of</b> <b>power</b> have been analysed in the research. The analysis has clearly pointed out that these, as well as other forms <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> can and must be analysed as the complete social-individual and positive-negative phenomena...|$|R

This {{is an important}} novel, {{not only because of}} its commercial success, but also because it depicts a specific marginalised subculture. Postmodernism and systems theory approaches, as well as changes in the social and political spheres have motivated researchers such as Geyer (1996), Kalekin-Fishman (1998) and Neal and Collas (2000) to reinterpret Seeman’s theory. This article attempts to incorporate this new theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in the analysis of contemporary fiction. Seeman identifies five aspects <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> namely powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, social isolation and self-estrangement. Following Neal and Collas (2000), in particular, this article omits self-estrangement, but shows how the other four aspects <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> have changed since Seeman’s formulation. It is argued that “Trainspotting” depicts a specific occurrence <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in modern western society, besides normlessness, meaninglessness, and social isolation, highlighting Seeman’s concept of powerlessness, in particular.

Stimmen. The introduction provides explanations concerning the history <b>of</b> the term <b>alienation</b> and shows that the research on Christa Wolf barely considered the crucial importance <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> for her work and neglected the autobiographical statements of the author on that topic. In the first chapter, {{some of the most important}} cultural and political events in the GDR and those occurring shortly after the reunification of Germany have been analyzed in order to understand which influence these events had on the literary work of Christa Wolf. This analysis aims at identifying which degrees <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> were present at given times and at deciphering the alienation experience in details. In this context, autobiographical and biographical relations, diaries, interviews, essays and other works of Christa Wolf were considered. Under the aspect <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> the second chapter considers the adaptation of myth by Christa Wolf, compares her dealing with the Cassandra- and Medea myth and tries to make apparent similarities and differences in her concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> The aim is to show which function the myth fulfills in this context and in which aspect the myth is used for projections <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> A comparison <b>of</b> those two myth adaptations seems necessary in order to find out if a shift took place in the perception of the author concerning alienation. The third chapter refers to the theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> by the sociologist Melvin Seeman. Seeman transferred the term <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> from the sociological context to the socio-psychological context and at the end of the 50 ties developed a scheme of five categories of subjective experience <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> According to his understanding there are five common meanings of this term: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation and self-estrangement. Seeman’s theory led to many controversies, mainly because the choice of his five categories and their relation to each other was questioned. After a short introduction of Seeman’s theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> the importance <b>of</b> his theory for the analysis of literary figures will be discussed. The fourth chapter aims at interpreting the <b>alienation</b> features <b>of</b> the literary figures in Medea. Stimmen on the basis of the classification by Melvin Seeman. Contrary to the prevalent belief that Christa Wolf’s Medea is a non-alienated figure, that judges, decides and acts with a great degree of determination, this work defends the thesis that not only Medea but rather all figures are alienated in different degrees. The theory by Melvin Seeman serves as a basis for the analysis of the different forms <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> experience <b>of</b> the literary figures. Under consideration of two important aspects, the political and cultural alienation, feelings, emotions and behavior of the figures will be explained. The plot of the novel is told from the perspective of the six figures: Medea, Jason, Agameda, Akamas, Glauke and Leukon. This serves as a basis for the literal analysis. The conclusion serves to compare the experience <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> the author with those of her literary figures...|$|R

My primary aim is {{to reconstruct}} Marx's economic categories {{in terms of his}} social theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> and vice versa. In other words, I reinterpret the social in the economic and the economic in the social by doing a close reading on Marx's early and later writings. My task is two-fold: first, to reveal within Marx's economic categories [...] as they are expressed in Capital and his later writings [...] his social theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> And second, to extend his theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> [...] as it is forcefully expressed in his early writings [...] through talk of the inner-workings of capital, that is to say, by infusing the structure <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> with the language of economics. I argue that Marx's social theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> underlies his labor theory of value, along with all the corresponding economic categories that unfold from it. I reconstruct Marx's conception of human nature to show how it informs his theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> and how the latter ultimately anchors his socio-economic-historical analysis of capitalist society and his conception of freedom. I conclude by sketching Marx's vision of the new society, that is, his conception of a non-alienating mode of production based on my reinterpretation...|$|R

A lack {{of community}} support and working in a larger populated community was associated with an increased sense <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> and a greater degree of inactivity among police officers. An increased sense <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> resulted in a greater degree of negative feelings and lethargy among police officers. The more police officers felt socially isolated from the community they served, the more they withdrew and the more negative they felt towards its citizens.|$|R

In Study 1, 434 students from grade 5 – 8 participated (cross-sectional design). In Study 2, we followed 356 students from grade 6 – 7 (longitudinal design). The results confirm the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> for boys and low achievers, the gradual progression <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> during adolescence, and the predictive value of instructional quality, positive teacher–student integration and positive student–student integration in determining academic alienation during early adolescence...|$|R

For planners who have responsibility for crafting a consensus out of participatory processes, interpreting these discrete voices {{is a critical}} professional task. Accurate interpretation, however, is an enormous challenge, particularly under the joint pressures of time and controversy. This dissertation identifies a methodology for examining variant strands of narrative encountered in zones of conflict and for using narrative details to inspect participants' institutional analyses of the precipitating crisis and its proposed resolution. The proposed interpretative method directs attention to narrators' figurative language {{for a series of}} interpretive cues found in the rhetorical patterns collectively known as tropes, hypothesizing that three specific tropes reflect the institutional dimensions of the conflict at hand: *the trope of conspiracy (causality and motive), *the trope of exile (invisibility and exclusion), and *the trope of resistance (authority and defiance). The three tropes correspond to aspects <b>of</b> <b>power</b> relationships: the concerted and motivated use <b>of</b> <b>power,</b> degrees <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> from <b>power,</b> and the consequent answer to power. For the planner, these tropes serve as heuristic(cont.) devices for institutional analysis embedded in the language of participants' narration. The dissertation's case study examined a city in state-imposed municipal receivership in Chelsea, Massachusetts, from 1991 to 1995. A small city in post-industrial decline and with a history of mismanagement and corruption, Chelsea also was in demographic transition from a predominantly white to a majority Latino population. The case focuses specifically on charter reform, initiated by state-appointed receiver Lewis H. Spence as an exercise in social-capital formation. The charter-drafting process provided an opportunity to observe narrative scenario-building and the operation of the identified tropes in a self-consciously constitutional moment, as Chelsea's constituencies struggled to set the terms for democratic governance and cultural co-existence through new political institutions. by Jean A.

This time, the authors state that the problem <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> personality in modern world is connected with not only just deprivation of attention, {{but it is also}} the result <b>of</b> the increased <b>alienation</b> and social problems. The authors have analyzed a number of social relationships, such as social-organic, atomistic, each of which can be further divided into two more classes: utilitarian and pluralistic, polyphonic or harmonic. These classes of relationships are important for understanding of the subject and object, and their interrelations. A particular {{attention has been paid to}} social polyphonic ties, which facilitate the advancement of the individual and humanity towards the overcoming <b>of</b> <b>alienation.</b> In addition, {{the authors have}} focused their attention on the role of creative activities in the development of social relations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{structure}} and the relevance of the concept <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> in the work of Marx, with an eye toward demonstrating the continuity of the theory <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> throughout his writings, particularly the Grundrisse. In sharp contrast to critics who claim that alienation theory is no longer relevant to a post-industrial, post-modern society, I posit four contemporary manifestations <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> (corresponding to the four constituents suggested by Marx) in American culture: current conditions of capitalistic exchange; the current crisis regarding health care; the post-modern development of the self, including personality and character development; and the social production of urban space. Having demonstrated the contemporary relevance of Marx 2 ̆ 7 s conception <b>of</b> <b>alienation,</b> I proceed to examine current communitarian criticisms of liberalism. The communitarian critique of liberalism inadequately addresses the fundamental issues which it attempts to resolve, I contend, because communitarian theory does not take Marxian critiques <b>of</b> <b>alienation</b> seriously. Consequently, the communitarian project needs to be reevaluated in light of these findings. ...|$|R
