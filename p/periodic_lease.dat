50|$|The term rental {{agreement}} is also sometimes {{used to describe}} a <b>periodic</b> <b>lease</b> agreement (most often a month-to-month lease) internationally and in some regions of the United States.|$|E
50|$|If {{the parties}} have not made any {{agreement}} about {{the duration of the}} lease, it is a <b>periodic</b> <b>lease,</b> the period being that in terms of which the rent is payable.|$|E
50|$|Rights to unique {{combinations}} {{of up to}} six characters can be purchased from a private company licensed by the NZ Transport Agency. The purchaser may acquire any unique combination that falls outside the standard numbering sequences (apart from derogatory, obscene, or intentionally confusing combinations) or standard numbers that have fallen into disuse. New Zealand does not require associating the plate with a vehicle, and allows outright sale rather than just a <b>periodic</b> <b>lease.</b>|$|E
40|$|In this research, iethe {{traditional}} residence {{reproduction system}} by the periodic rented house systemlc is proposed, and it aims at verifying {{the possibility of}} a system from planned side and technical side. Improvement and use system by the periodic rented house system mainly reforms the old residences which is the important element which consti- tutes the scene of town at a borrowers burden, and preservation and practical use of a old residences are realized at the same time by using an old residences as a rented house. The feature of a system is that a habitation term is secured at the time of a rental contract. There are two kinds in the method of security one is security of the habitation term by the special article added to old land and house lease law another is security of the contract term by <b>periodic</b> rented house <b>lease</b> law. From this, the long-term habitation for 10 to 20 years and large-scale repair of old residences house are possible...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{a firm that}} leases a single type of product and also sells remanufactured versions of this product that become available {{at the end of}} their lease periods. We assume that when the quantity of end-of-lease items in stock is not sufficient to meet the demand for remanufactured products, the firm has the option to purchase additional cores from a third-party core supplier at a certain unit cost. Customers have a lower willingness-to-pay for the remanufactured product and their preference is modeled using a maximum utility approach. We develop a multi-period model to determine the selling price of remanufactured products and the <b>periodic</b> <b>lease</b> payments of new products. We investigate the effect of key product characteristics such as deterioration in age and unit cost of purchasing cores from a third-party supplier, and key target market characteristics such as relative willingness-to-pay for buying a remanufactured product and relative willingness-to-pay for leasing a new product. The resulting problem is a nonlinear optimization problem which is solved by a variant of Nelder-Mead simplex search method. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{fruitful}} {{parent of}} injustice is {{the tyranny of}} conceptsâ€™ (Cardozo 1928). This warning seems apposite when reviewing {{the impact of the}} decision of the House of Lords in Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council v Monk [1992] 1 AC 478, HL. Since Monk the law is well settled that one joint tenant of a <b>periodic</b> <b>lease</b> can destroy the lease held by both joint tenants. This destructive ability is justified by a conceptual analysis that refuses to recognise the destructive effects of its utilisation. With a reform of the law on the horizon the time is ripe for a review of this peculiar area of law (see Law Com No 284). If we are correct in our analysis, Monk has been productive of an unnecessary amount of mischief in the law. This is partially due to the deployment of inappropriate concepts in Monk itself, and partially due to an unfortunate subsequent tendency to allow these concepts to act as tyrants in dictating legal development. Monk has had an effect directly or indirectly across many different areas of the legal landscape. This has necessitated both an unwelcome length and a complex structure for this article...|$|E
