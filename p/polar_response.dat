40|$|Diffusing {{devices are}} used to improve room {{acoustics}} {{in a wide variety}} of applications. The dispersion generated by current diffuser technologies is often limited to mid- to high frequencies because low frequency diffusers are usually too large to be easily accommodated. To extend the bandwidth of diffusers to a lower frequency a new approach is proposed, that is to use active control technology. In particular, active impedance techniques have been exploited to create non-absorbing diffusers, and hybrid structures that partly absorb while dispersing any reflected sound. This paper presents results mostly from a feedforward structure. It is found that achieving active dispersion without absorption other a worthwhile bandwidth can be more difficult than achieving active absorption due to the more complex target impedance that the controller needs to learn. Measurements on <b>polar</b> <b>responses</b> provide evidence that the active diffusers can achieve wider bandwidth dispersion. Boundary element modelling has enabled the design of these structures to be examined in more application-realistic setups. ...|$|R

By comparison a monopole response consists of one lobe. This can be useful in reducing the stimulation of resonant room modes at low frequencies. It also results in high frequencies being reflected from any rear wall, which can enhance the naturalness of the sound in typical listening rooms by creating more diffuse reverberation, though in theory it could detract from stereo localization. For this reason dipole speakers are often used as surround channel speakers, where a diffuse sound is desired to create ambience.|$|E

40|$|Capturing speech signals for {{enhancement}} is {{an important}} stage in all modern communication systems. Traditionally, speech enhancement is performed on a single channel recording, but recently the advantages of multichannel speech processing have been indentified. The multichannel speech signals are captured using a microphone array, and by using the spatio-temporal information at {{the output of the}} microphone array the directional information of the source can be derived and spatial filtering of the captured signal can be performed, which show superior performance over single channel approaches. Generally, spatially distributed microphone arrays as used in speech signal processing, only capture the acoustic pressure. In this thesis, however, a co-located microphone array which captures both acoustic pressure and particle velocity, known as an Acoustic Vector Sensor (AVS), will be used for capturing speech signals for enhancement. The AVS used in this work consists of two pressure gradient sensors and an omni-directional microphone which enables the capturing of speech of signals in 2 D. Compared with other microphone arrays, the size of the AVS array is small, occupying a volume of approximately 1 cm 3. The small size of the AVS array enables it be used in mobile electronic devices such as mobile phones and mobile personal computers which traditionally have a single microphone capsule. In this thesis, a design change for the AVS is presented, which, improves the accuracy of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimates from the AVS. It is shown that by offsetting the directional sensors on the AVS array, a source direction can be identified with an accuracy of two degrees for a stationery speech source and five degrees for both moving and multiple speech sources. Here, DOA estimates are found using the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) Algorithm in the time domain and an intensity based algorithm in the frequency domain. For multiple sources, a new data clustering technique is introduced with the existing frequency domain intensity based algorithm. Speech enhancement methods, which take advantage of the directional characteristics of the AVS array are presented. It is shown that by taking advantage of the directional characteristics of the AVS to obtain noise estimates used in the Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamformer, an improvement of 1. 34 Mean Opinion Score (MOS) was achieved over the conventional MVDR beamformer. Here, the noise covariance matrix is obtained by a new technique which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the AVS array outputs. Furthermore, it is shown that by applying the Griffiths and Jim (GJ) beamformer to the AVS output channels, a MOS of 1. 74 over unprocessed noise corrupted speech signals was achieved in listening tests. A new technique for speech enhancement which combines Linear Predictive (LP) spectrum-based perceptual filtering to the recordings obtained from an AVS is presented. The technique takes advantage of the directional <b>polar</b> <b>responses</b> of the AVS to obtain a significantly more accurate representation of the LP spectrum of a target speech signal in the presence of noise when compared to single channel, omni-directional recordings. Listening tests results show significant improvements in MOS scores of 1. 6 over unprocessed noise corrupted speech. Further improvements to the proposed LP spectrum based perceptual filtering are achieved by introducing the averaged autocorrelation function to obtain a multichannel LP spectrum from the directional components of the AVS array. By introducing the average autocorrelation function a MOS of 1. 98 over unprocessed noise corrupted speech signals is achieved. In addition to the perceptual filter, two Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithms are presented. The well known Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and a new method based on the clustering of DOA estimates performed on a time frequency basis are presented. Comparisons are made between co-located microphone arrays that contain microphones with mixed <b>polar</b> <b>responses</b> and traditional Uniform Linear Arrays (ULA) formed from omni-directional microphones and Soundfield microphones. It is shown that <b>polar</b> <b>responses</b> of the microphones are a key factor in the performance of ICA applied to co-located microphones. It is shown by applying the two BSS algorithms, improvements of 1. 75 and 2. 09 MOS over unprocessed noise corrupted speech signals are achieved for ICA and DOA based methods respectively, during listening tests. Finally, the DOA estimation and clustering method for BSS is used for dereverberation of speech signals. It is shown that by using the directional characteristics of the AVS array, reflections from different directions can be minimized. The results show that an improvement in terms of Signal to Reverberant Ratio (SRR) of 1. 5 dB and 2. 5 dB for a source at 1 m and 5 m from the AVS array respectively is achieved...|$|R

Aim: This study was done with an aim to assess the relationship between oral health behavior, oral hygiene and gingival status of third and final year dental students from a Dental College in Indore City, India. Methods: A total of 137 dental students participated in the study. The students were invited to complete the Hiroshima University-Dental Behavioral Inventory (HU-DBI) questionnaire. The HU-DBI questionnaire consisted of twenty <b>polar</b> <b>responses</b> (agree/disagree) regarding oral health-related behavior. In addition, two further questions about the frequency of brushing and flossing were included. Subsequently, oral health examination was conducted to assess plaque and gingival status. Data were analyzed using Chi-square test, Independent sample t-test, and Pearson′s correlation. The significance level was set at P ≤ 0. 05. Result: The results showed that about 66. 6 % of the students checked their teeth in the mirror after brushing. Only 20. 1 % of the students reported bleeding from gums. The mean oral heath behavior score (HU-DBI) was 6. 47 ± 2. 0. A negative correlation of HU-DBI scores with plaque (r = − 0. 501) and gingival scores (r = − 0. 580) was observed.

The experiment setup was designed to include simulations of extended NH winter seasons for either strong easterly or strong westerly phases of the tropical QBO, forced with either sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from the strong ENSO event that occurred in 1997 / 1998 or with climatological SSTs. It has been found that the weakening and warming of the polar vortex associated with a warm ENSO are intensified {{at the end of the}} winter during both QBO phases. In addition, the westerly QBO phase delays the onset of the warm ENSO signal, while the easterly QBO phase advances it. Warm ENSO events also impact the extratropical signal of the QBO by intensifying (weakening) the QBO effects in early (late) winter. Therefore, it appears that during warm ENSO events the duration of QBO signal in the northern extratropics is shortened while its downward propagation accelerated. Our dynamical analysis has revealed that these results are due to changes in the background flow caused by the QBO combined with changes in the anomalous propagation and dissipation of extratropical waves generated by warm ENSO.
