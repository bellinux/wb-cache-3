30|$|When {{reviewed}} in a Kuhnian perspective, GMA {{seems to have}} many strengths. Existence of a scientific community with university <b>departments,</b> <b>periodicals,</b> and academicians {{makes it possible to}} find solutions to contradict between profit and environment orientations and facilitating the adoption of environmental strategies into business decision-making processes. In addition, the presence of common beliefs, values, and assumptions renders the constitution of GMAs’ norms, which motivates academicians and practitioners to support and implement the principles of environmental management. Furthermore, increasing environmental problems which TMA causes and the insufficiency of normal science coping with the global environmental problems cause crises and results with anomalousness. This fact also led to emergence of governmental, intergovernmental, or non-governmental environmental organizations, which compel companies to go green. These mentioned factors empower the GMA.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a method {{which was used}} to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of three different ways of supplying periodical articles in an academic library. The methods considered were: subscribing to a periodical title (ownership); individual article supply provided by two electronic document delivery services, ArticlesFirst of OCLC FirstSearch and UnCover; and traditional article supply through the British Library Document Supply Centre. The operational costs of the alternatives are obtained by taking a management accounting approach and are examined in relation to the provision of the services within the library of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, Ireland. The cost-per-use of owning a periodical title is calculated based on the operational costs of the <b>Periodicals</b> <b>Department</b> of the library, its subscription price and a lifetime use determined by examination of the current requests for articles made through the library's Inter-Library Loans Department. The cost-per-use for the other services are also calculated based on their operational costs and document delivery charges...|$|E

40|$|Building {{multilingual}} {{resources and}} providing multilingual services {{have always been}} important tasks for Chinese academic libraries, {{but they are also}} the difficult issues that the libraries are facing. In this chapter, we present a survey conducted on six different academic libraries for collecting data on multilingual resource building, on the usages of the multilingual resources and on multilingual services. Each of our survey to an academic library consisted of four interviews to the library administrator and the librarians of the book, <b>periodical</b> and database <b>departments.</b> Our goal in this chapter is to examine multilingual resources and services in academic libraries in China. The study results confirm several conclusions from the literature about multilingual resources and services in Chinese academic libraries, and at the same time, the results also reveal original insights on possible strategic decision on focusing on multilingual databases and books, and on the problem of lacking adoption of translation-based technologies such as cross-language information access and machine translation in improving the usages of multilingual collections and services...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the planning flexibility and the passive ventilation and lighting {{potential of the}} Chicago courtyard apartment building type through a systematic type / variant analysis of built examples. In an era of increasingly expensive energy {{the advantages of the}} passive ventilation and lighting strategies inherent in these pre-air conditioned designs becomes apparent. The basic courtyard building type is defined and documented through drawings and with historic and contemporary images. The base courtyard building type is compared and contrasted with the variants. In addition, the urban condition of the basic building type and variants is documented in figure ground and Nolli type maps. These maps are used to illustrate the variety of urban conditions in which Chicago courtyard apartment buildings are successfully integrated. Data have been collected from archives, the City of Chicago Planning <b>Department,</b> <b>periodicals</b> and from field investigations. This research will illustrate how the historic courtyard type responds successfully to a variety of urban conditions while providing ample natural ventilation and lighting making it a model type for contemporary multi-unit housing design...|$|R
40|$|As {{academic}} libraries {{strive to}} meet the challenges of the 21 st century, we need to examine new ways to fulfill our educational mission. Simply continuing to do things the same way we always have is no longer an option. On the one hand, technology is rapidly changing how we go about our work. On the other hand, competition among institutions of higher learning is such that only those who provide the best educational experience for their students will thrive. 	Faced with these challenges, college and university libraries have implemented a variety of reorganizational strategies. A review of the literature provides copious examples of this. More recent examples of this include the excellent article by Mori Lou Higa and others describing changes at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and the collection of articles edited by Bradford Lee Eden which deals specifically with the reorganization of library technical services.

Epoxy resin nanocomposites {{incorporated}} with 0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 wt % pristine graphene and modified graphene oxide (GO) nanoflakes were produced and used to fabricate carbon fiber-reinforced and glass fiber-reinforced composite panels via vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding process. Mechanical and thermal properties of the composite panels-called hierarchical graphene composites-were determined according to ASTM standards. It was observed that the studied properties were improved consistently by {{increasing the amount of}} nanoinclusions. Particularly, in the presence of 4 wt % GO in the resin, tensile modulus, compressive strength, and flexural modulus of carbon fiber (glass fiber) composites were improved 15 % (21 %), 34 % (84 %), and 40 % (68 %), respectively. Likewise, with inclusion of 4 wt % pristine graphene in the resin, tensile modulus, compressive strength, and flexural modulus of carbon fiber (glass fiber) composites were improved 11 % (7 %), 30 % (77 %), and 34 % (58 %), respectively. Also, thermal conductivity of the carbon fiber (glass fiber) composites with 4 % GO inclusion was improved 52 % (89 %). Similarly, thermal conductivity of the carbon fiber (glass fiber) composites with 4 % pristine graphene inclusion was improved 45 % (80 %). The reported results indicate that both pristine graphene and modified GO nanoflakes are excellent options to enhance the mechanical and thermal properties of fiber-reinforced polymeric composites and to make them viable replacement materials for metallic parts in different industries, such as wind energy, aerospace, marine, and automotive.

40|$|In 1991 the Department of Defense (DoD) {{implemented}} {{the most profound}} reforms to defense resource management since {{the introduction of the}} Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System in the early 1960 's. These changes fundamentally altered the way the Department of Defense managed its resources by introducing a business culture into defense operations. One of the more significant changes was the establishment of the Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF), a revolving fund financial structure. DBOF was established in October 1991 by merging into a single fund the former stock and industrial funds and several activities previously funded with direct appropriations. The DBOF financial structure has multiple divisions identified by Component and by business area (e. g., Army Supply Management, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Navy Depot Maintenance). Its purpose is to improve the delivery of support services to the Department's operating forces while reducing the cost of operations. This research paper describes, in detail, the Defense Business Operations Fund's organization, structure, purpose and performance to date. It examines the key concepts of unit costs/transfer pricing and break-even point operations, and discusses major problems such as poor cost and management accounting systems. In fiscal year (FY) 1995, support services financed through the DBOF financial structure involved approximately 316, 000 civilian and military personnel providing some $ 78. 9 billion in goods and services essential for military operations. In an effort to determine the success of this extremely important business practice, military regulations were researched, government audit reports were analyzed, and Department of Defense and commercial <b>periodicals</b> were reviewed. <b>Department</b> of Political ScienceThesis (M.
