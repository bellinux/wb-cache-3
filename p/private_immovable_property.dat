It is therefore time for the legal community to address this situation by investigating just how legal such activity is—and bringing their findings {{to the attention of}} governments. This can be done through an examination of the relationship between national law and international space law, of the provisions of international space law—especially Article 2 of the Outer Space Treaty—and by answering any claims to <b>private</b> ownership of <b>immovable</b> <b>property.</b> Aside from the fact that individuals appear to be being duped, the pursuit of property claims on the Moon could impede future activities aimed at benefiting society...|$|R
40|$|The recent Green Paper on Mortgage Credit in the EU (Brussels: European Commission, 2005) {{confirms}} that the European Commission is giving serious consideration to ‘the feasibility and desirability’ of a pan-European mortgage (‘Euromortgage’ or ‘Eurohypothec’) to facilitate the integration of cross-border financing of real estate investments. The {{purpose of this paper}} is two-fold. First, to examine the proposed Eurohypothec as a central case in the larger project of attaining cross-border commonality in European <b>private</b> laws of <b>immovable</b> <b>property.</b> Second, to consider whether the prevailing model for the Eurohypothec can be accommodated in England and Wales. It is argued that doctrinal indeterminacy or ‘shapelessness’ in national property institutions of EU Member States assists in the reception of pan-European institutions alongside national laws, and thereby advances the project to achieve ius commune Europaeum in property law. It will be demonstrated that the mortgage law of England and Wales exemplifies the necessary doctrinal indeterminacy and therefore provides fertile ground for the reception of the Eurohypothec...|$|R

40|$|A {{non-resident}} who disposes of {{a direct}} interest in <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> or an indirect interest in <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> through the disposal of shares {{may be subject to}} capital gains tax in the country in which the <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> is situated. Certain African countries were selected and the capital gains tax consequences on disposal of such property were determined by analysing the domestic tax legislation of the country in which the property is situated. In addition, the effect of any applicable double tax agreement ('DTA') to such disposals was considered. In certain countries - such as Angola and Nigeria - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident will not be subject to capital gains tax in the respective country where the property is situated regardless {{of the value of the}} shares that is attributable to <b>immovable</b> <b>property.</b> In certain countries - such as Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident may be subject to capital gains tax upon the disposal of an interest in <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> in the respective country in which the <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> is held regardless of the value of the shares that is attributable to <b>immovable</b> <b>property,</b> unless a DTA provides otherwise. In certain other countries - such as Botswana, Ghana, Lesotho and South Africa - in terms of their domestic tax legislation, a non-resident may be subject to capital gains tax upon the disposal of an interest in <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> in the respective country in which the <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> is held, however this will depend in general on the percentage of the value of shares that is attributable to <b>immovable</b> <b>property,</b> unless a DTA provides otherwise. Certain countries domestic tax legislation have specific provisions regulating how this percentage is determined. A DTA may provide relief to taxpayers who are subject to capital gains tax in both their resident country and the source country, on the disposal of an interest in <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> held in the source country. In terms of domestic tax legislation, where the non-resident is liable to pay capital gains tax in the source country, the non-resident will in general have to comply with the withholding tax and filing obligations of that country where applicable...|$|R

This forms the basis for fixing the expropriation price” (T.C. Resmi Gazete 1983).

The application of the origin principle causes (additional) difficulties because of the different concepts employed in the national laws. In order to achieve a more uniform approach, we prefer to draft legislation by means of regulations instead of directives. Moreover, inequalities between Member States will be reduced if terms used in the regulations are defined precisely. With regard to <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> transactions this means that terms as <b>immovable</b> <b>property,</b> accommodation in the hotel sector, permanently installed equipment, right in rem, lease, etc. may not longer be interpreted from a Civil Law perspective, but it is preferable to give a definition in the VAT regulation.

40|$|The {{relation}} between the Articles 6, 7 and 21 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (OECD Model), {{and in particular the}} scope of the exception for <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> in Article 21 (2), has been widely debated in academic literature. The approach proposed in this article gives the <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> exception a proper role, thus defining the {{relation between}} the Articles 6, 7 and 21 of the OECD Model in e. g. triangular cases involving <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> of an enterprise. In the case of <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> of an enterprise that is situated in the residence state (State R) or in a third state (State T) and that is attributable to a permanent establishment (PE) in the other contracting state (State S), the author takes the view that the ‘context’ within the meaning of Article 3 (2) of the R-S tax treaty prevents State S from categorizing the income under Article 7, regardless of its domestic law classification of the income as business profits. This context consists, inter alia, of Article 21 (2) of the R-S tax treaty. Consequently, Article 21 (1) of the R-S tax treaty must be applied in respect of the income from the <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> located in State R or in State T, assigning the exclusive taxation right under this treaty to State R. To reinforce the proposed approach, the author recommends adding language to the OECD Commentary on Article 21 which confirms the inapplicability of Article 7 to income from <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> situated in State R or State T. Regardless of the proposed changes to the OECD Commentary, the author believes that the effectiveness of the exclusion of <b>immovable</b> <b>property</b> from the scope of Article 21 (2) could be further improved by amending Article 21 as suggested...|$|R
