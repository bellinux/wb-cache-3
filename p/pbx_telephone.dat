50|$|A SIP {{connection}} is a marketing term for voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services offered by many Internet telephony service providers (ITSPs). The service provides routing of telephone calls from a client's {{private branch exchange}} (<b>PBX)</b> <b>telephone</b> system to the {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). Such services may simplify corporate information system infrastructure by sharing Internet access for voice and data, and removing the cost for Basic Rate Interface (BRI) or Primary Rate Interface (PRI) telephone circuits.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} unified {{communications}} {{is tied to}} the evolution of the supporting technology. Originally, business telephone systems were a private branch exchange (<b>PBX)</b> or key <b>telephone</b> system provided and managed by the local phone company. These systems used the phone company's analog or digital circuits to deliver phone calls from a central office (CO) to the customer. The system [...] - <b>PBX</b> or key <b>telephone</b> system - [...] accepted the call and routed the call to the appropriate extension or line appearance on the phones at the customer's office.|$|R

50|$|In the 1960s, Condon {{contributed to}} the {{development}} of local area network digital telephone switching.Condon and Ken Thompson promoted the use of the C programming language for AT&T’s switching system control programs. Condon acquired a small AT&T <b>PBX</b> (<b>telephone</b> switch) that handled about 50 phones; he made the necessary hardware changes and Thompson wrote the necessary software programs. The PBX code rewrite in C was a success and hastened the adoption of C for all switching system software within AT&T.|$|E
50|$|In telephony, a Foreign {{exchange}} station (FXS), is a telephone interface that supplies battery power, provides dial tone, and generates ringing voltage. A device that connects {{to such an}} interface contains a foreign exchange office (FXO) interface and could be a standard analog telephone or a private branch exchange (<b>PBX)</b> to receive <b>telephone</b> service.|$|R
50|$|Private Branch Exchange (<b>PBX)</b> was a <b>telephone</b> {{exchange}} {{device that}} {{acted as a}} mini-switchboard to route phone calls. The closed nature of PBXs limited flexibility, and a system was designed to enable common computing devices to make routing decisions. The automated form of this technology developed into the automated call distribution system, where issued information about incoming calls would direct a response.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of competition, each {{individual}} carrier required its own prefixes in each rate center in each municipality, depleting available prefixes within high-growth and high-competition areas. (These were already under pressure due to increased use of direct inward dial <b>PBX</b> extensions, mobile <b>telephones,</b> pagers, fax machines and dial-up modems at the time). Many of these new prefixes were largely empty. This led to a rapid increase in {{the introduction of new}} area codes.|$|R
50|$|Analog Display Services Interface (ADSI) is a {{telephony}} {{technology that}} is used in {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS) or computer-based private branch exchange (<b>PBX)</b> <b>telephone</b> service. It works in conjunction with a screen-based telephone ("screenphone") or other compatible customer-premises equipment (CPE) to provide the user with softkey access to telephone company or internal PBX custom calling features. It is an analog service because it uses analog frequency-shift keying (FSK) technology to interact with an LCD screen via short, low-baud rate, downloads to refresh and re-program softkeys in real-time.|$|E
50|$|In the {{globalization}} {{era of the}} 1990s, Siemens Information Systems acquired Rolm Systems from IBM in 1989, which was the third largest supplier of <b>PBX</b> <b>telephone</b> switching equipment in North America. The same year, Siemens and the British-based industrial conglomerate - General Electric Company plc (GEC) through their joint company GEC Siemens plc; acquired Plessey, a British-based international electronics, defence and telecommunications company founded in 1917. Most of Plessey assets were divided between the companies; but the 1988 founded GEC-Plessey joint venture, GEC-Plessey Telecommunications (GPT), was converted to a '60/40 GEC/Siemens joint venture'.|$|E
50|$|Some private branch {{exchange}} (<b>PBX)</b> <b>telephone</b> systems use a paging facility {{that acts as a}} liaison between the telephone and a PA amplifier. In other systems, paging equipment is not built into the telephone system. Instead the system includes a separate paging controller connected to a trunk port of the telephone system. The paging controller is accessed as either a designated directory number or central office line. In many modern systems, the paging function is integrated into the telephone system, and allows announcements to be played over the phone speakers.|$|E

25|$|For {{corporate}} or enterprise use, {{a private}} telephone exchange {{is often referred}} to as a private branch exchange (PBX), when it has connections to the public switched <b>telephone</b> network. A <b>PBX</b> is installed in enterprise facilities, typically collocated with large office spaces or within an organizational campus to serve the local private telephone system and any private leased line circuits. Smaller installations might deploy a <b>PBX</b> or key <b>telephone</b> system in the office of a receptionist.|$|R
5000|$|A private branch {{exchange}} (<b>PBX)</b> is a <b>telephone</b> exchange or switching system that serves a private organization and performs concentration of central office lines or trunks and provides intercommunication between {{a large number of}} telephone stations in the organization.

5000|$|Centrex obviates {{the need}} for {{separate}} exchange lines delivered to a site for use with a 1A2 Key System or similar, or <b>PBX.</b> Instead, <b>telephone</b> extensions, called Centrex lines, are delivered directly from the local exchange to the user. Some customers, however, still like to use a key telephone system for a small office within the large corporate Centrex, in an arrangement called [...] "key behind Centrex". Unlike with a conventional PBX, {{it is a simple}} matter to have extensions at different locations while allowing them to function as if they were within the same building. Newer IP PBX systems also allow phones at any location with a WAN or Internet connection to act as a local extension. Facilities such as Direct Inward Dialing (DID), where individual extensions are offered a direct and unique telephone number for incoming calls, are standard features in a Centrex environment. Stations may also be part of a hunt group, allowing for automatic distribution of incoming calls to two or more extensions.|$|R
50|$|Simplified Message Desk Interface (SMDI) is a {{protocol}} {{that defines the}} interface between a voice mail system and a phone system such as a <b>PBX</b> or public <b>telephone</b> switch. It was developed by Bell Labs. It is used to provide the voice mail system the information it needs to process the call. Each time a call {{is sent to the}} voice mail system, a message is sent using SMDI over a serial interface that identifies the line, the type of call, and the calling/called party numbers. The SMDI protocol also specifies a method for turning the message-waiting indicator (MWI) on and off on individual telephones.|$|R
50|$|Trunk {{lines are}} used for {{connecting}} a private branch exchange (<b>PBX)</b> to a <b>telephone</b> service provider. When needed {{they can be used}} by any telephone connected to the PBX, while the station lines to the extensions serve only one station telephones. Trunking saves cost, because there are usually fewer trunk lines than extension lines, since it is unusual in most offices to have all extension lines in use for external calls at once. Trunk lines transmit voice and data in formats such as analog, T1, E1, ISDN or PRI. The dial tone lines for outgoing calls are called DDCO (Direct Dial Central Office) trunks.|$|R

50|$|The major {{drawback}} to this service was {{the reliance on}} the phone company or vendor partner to manage (in most cases) the <b>PBX</b> or key <b>telephone</b> system. This resulted in a residual, recurring cost to customers. Over time, the PBX became more privatized, and internal staff members were hired to manage these systems. This was typically done by companies that could afford to bring this skill in-house and thereby reduce the requirement to notify the phone company or their local PBX vendor each time a change was required in the system. This increasing privatization triggered {{the development of more}} powerful software that increased the usability and manageability of the system.|$|R
40|$|With the {{installation}} of a new Private Branch Exchange (<b>PBX),</b> a <b>telephone</b> switch system, the Naval Postgraduate School is looking for the most effective method of sourcing the management, operations, and maintenance functions of the switch system. This thesis examines other organizations that operate a PBX in a campus-like environment. Using the data from these organizations, this thesis creates a decision framework for the NPS PBX sourcing decision using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Separate but linked hierarchies are created for the Management, Operations, and Maintenance functions. The Functional criteria in the AHP include Level of Responsiveness, System Updates, Level of Control, Personnel Expertise, and Cost Factors. These hierarchies {{can be used to}} make a sourcing decision that reflect the priorities and thresholds of acceptable service set by the decision-maker at NPS. Cost data was not available for other organizations, so lull development of the AHP was not possible. Based on the available information, this thesis recommends that NPS should source its PBX management, maintenance and operations initially through a mix of in-house and contractor functions, track costs and other service expectations, and make a second sourcing decision at a later date.

50|$|For {{direct inward dialing}} service, the {{telephone}} company provides one or more trunk lines to the customer for connection to the customer's PBX, and allocates a range of telephone numbers to the customer. Calls to such numbers are forwarded to the customer's PBX via the trunks. As calls are presented to the <b>PBX,</b> the dialed <b>telephone</b> number is signaled to the PBX with Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) using a prearranged, usually partial format, e.g., the last four digits. The PBX may use this information to route the call directly to a telephone extension within the organization {{without the need for}} an operator or attendant. The service provides inbound telephone service for many telephone numbers requiring {{only a limited number of}} physical telecommunication circuits to satisfy the average concurrent usage by the customer.|$|R
