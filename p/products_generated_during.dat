40|$|International audienceThe {{satisfaction}} of customers' requirements, such as quality, sustainability {{and cost of}} products, {{plays an important role}} in the context of global and concurrent economy. Thus, the requirements which products have to meet are increasingly high and tightened. However, a product during its life-cycle passes through many stages from conceptual design to the end of life. It especially passes through manufacturing and assembly stages where geometrical deviations can be generated and accumulated. At this stage of the design various simulations are made to predict product performances. All these simulations are done using the nominal model of the product coming from the modelling of the product in a CAD environment. Thus, the deviations which are obviously influent on the performances of the product are not taken into account. The performance variation due to geometric deviations can make the product designed not to meet fully the requirements of customer and user. The important issue proposed in this paper is: "How can we supervise geometrical deviations of a <b>product,</b> <b>generated</b> <b>during</b> its life-cycle, from earlier conceptual design stage?".

Human Ets- 1 exists under three isoforms: p 51, the predominant full-length isoform, p 42 and p 27, shorter alternatively spliced isoforms. We have previously demonstrated that Ets 71 p 51, but not the spliced variant Ets- 1 p 42, is processed by caspases in vitro and during apoptosis. However, the caspase cleavage of the second spliced variant Ets- 1 p 27 remains to investigate. In the present study, we demonstrate that Ets- 1 p 27 is a cleavage substrate of caspases. We show that Ets- 1 p 27 is processed in vitro by caspase- 3, resulting in three C-terminal fragments Cp 20, Cp 17 and Cp 14. Similarly, Ets- 1 p 27 was cleaved during apoptotic cell death induced by anisomycin, producing fragments consistent with those observed in in vitro cleavage assay.

In vitro cleavage of Ets- 1 p 51 by caspase- 3 produces fragments consistent with those observed in cells undergoing apoptosis. These fragments are generated by cleavage at three sites located in the exon VII-encoded region of Ets- 1 p 51. This region is absent in the Ets- 1 p 42 isoform, which therefore cannot be cleaved by caspases.
