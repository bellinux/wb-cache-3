40|$|Climate {{change is}} an {{important}} challenge for most wine producing countries, since wine quality is closely linked to terroir, an interaction between soil, climate and training method. Hence a change in climate should induce a change in viticultural techniques, if one wants to keep the typicity of his appellation wines. In the Mediterranean region, the evolution towards warmer and drier summers has a strong and generally unfavourable influence on vineyard productivity (i. e. : yield and quality). Optimal vine water status dynamics have been therefore defined to produce distinctive wine profiles. However, the latter approach is rarely implemented in practice, since classical methods to measure grapevine water status are either too tedious or too expensive to be implemented on a large scale. To overcome those limits, a model-based decision support system (DSS), named iTKVigne, has been developed by a consortium led by ITK Company. The models included in this DSS were specifically adapted from former work done by INRA and CIRAD, and have been tested in the field from 2009 to 2013. After an initial calibration, this DSS {{has proven to be}} able to provide a very satisfactory estimation of pre-dawn water potential according to the soil, climate and vineyard training method at significantly lower cost than classical techniques. Unlike physical water status measurements, iTKVigne does not only allow a more accurate and water saving irrigation (irrigation quantities are generally reduced by about 15 % when compared to current irrigation practices), it also allows adapting the training method according to the desired <b>production</b> <b>objective,</b> for winegrowers who cannot or do not want to irrigate. It may also be used as a tool to forecast on a <b>production</b> <b>objective</b> basis the future water requirements of new irrigation perimeters...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{principles of}} sustained yield {{have long been}} relied upon in the planning of forestry management. Along with the more recently introduced concept of multiple-use, sustained yield remains the catchcry of forest managers. The principles of sustained yield concentrate on planning the extent and timing of harvesting for wood <b>production</b> <b>objectives.</b> However, in the transition from forestry management to forest management, these principles, with their heavy emphasis on wood <b>production</b> <b>objectives,</b> have been at variance with the multiple use concept {{in a number of}} ways. This study attempts to document these areas of conflict for forest management in Tasmania. Sustained yield management in Tasmania is carried out on a regional basis. One of these regions, the Southern Forests, is used as a case study for examining the compatibility between the application of sustained yield and multiple use concepts. The techniques of sustained yield management used in the Southern Forests are documented with particular attention being paid to the assumptions made in the planning of management operations. These assumptions are then analysed in terms of their potential effect on management's ability to incorporate non-wood objectives in its planning. The study concludes that while strong reliance on the traditional principles of sustained yield is maintained, non-wood values will only get partial consideration in forest management planning. This consideration is usually given where there is only minimal interference with wood <b>production</b> <b>objectives.</b> A change in the present use of sustained yield estimates and a shift in the emphasis of data collection are suggested as preliminary steps in ensuring that non-wood values are given adequate consideration in forest management planning...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 A {{simulation}} and decision-support {{software product}} for aquaculture facility design and management planning is described (AquaFarm, Oregon State UniversityÂ©), including comprehensive documentation and applications to practical problems. AquaFarm provides (1) simulation of physical, chemical, and biological unit processes, (2) simulation of facility and fish culture management, (3) compilation of facility resource and enterprise budgets, and (4) a {{graphical user interface}} and data management capabilities. These analytical tools are combined into an interactive, decision support system, for the analysis and development of facility design specifications and management strategies. Intended user groups include aquaculture research, engineering, education, and production. As guided by the user, aquaculture facilities can be of any type, configuration, and management objectives, for purposes of broodfish maturation, egg incubation, and/or growout of finfish or crustaceans in cage, single pass, serial reuse, water recirculation, or solar-algae pond systems. User-accessible specifications include (1) site climate and water supplies, (2) components and configurations offish culture systems, (3) fish and facility management strategies, (4) unit costs for budget items, (5) <b>production</b> <b>objectives</b> (species, time schedules, and fish numbers and weights), and (6) parameters of unit-process and fish performance models. Based on these specifications, aquaculture facilities are simulated, resource requirements are compiled, and operation schedules are determined so that <b>production</b> <b>objectives</b> are achieved. Facility performance is reported to the user as management schedules, summary reports, resource and graphical compilations of time-series data for unit process, fish, and water quality variables.
