40|$|Objective: Colorectal {{surgeons}} {{are frequently}} on call to {{provide help to}} gynecologists who are managing bowel problems that occur either during or following gynecological surgery. This is a retrospective analysis of a single surgeon’s experiences associated with such instances. The analysis focuses on whether there have been any changes in referral patterns, surgical techniques and/or results. Materials and Methods: From July 1984 to June 2008, 282 patients were operated on by a single colorectal surgeon, for problems that were related to gynecology. These consisted of 137 patients operated on during the first 12 -year period, from July 1984 to June 1996. During this first period, 85 patients were operated on for cervical cancer related problems, 39 patients were operated on for problems related to other gynecological malignancies and nine patients were operated on for iatrogenic bowel injury during surgery. During the second 12 -year period, from July 1996 to June 2008, 145 patients were operated on. Of these, 85 patients were operated on for cervical cancer related problems, 44 patients were operated on for problems related to other gynecological malignancies and eight patients were operated on for iatrogenic bowel injury during surgery. Results: During the first 12 -year period, six operations were <b>pelvic</b> <b>exenterations</b> for primary gynecological malignancies or recurrences. One hundred and one patients received stomas during their first operation. Twenty-five patients encountered various complications. Postoperative death occurred in five patients.

40|$|AIM: There is wide {{disparity}} {{in the care}} of patients with multi-visceral involvement of rectal cancer. The results of treatment of advanced and recurrent colorectal cancer are presented from a centre where a dedicated Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) is central to the management. METHOD: All consecutive MDT referrals between 2010 and 2014 were examined. Analysis was undertaken of the referral pathway, site, selection process, management decision, R 0 resection rate, mortality / morbidity / Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification of morbidity, length of stay (LOS), and improvement of quality of life. RESULTS: There were 954 referrals. These included locally advanced primary rectal cancer (LAPRC b-TME) [39. 0 %], rectal recurrence (RR) [22. 0 %], locally advanced primary colon cancer (LAPCC T 3 c/d-T 4) [21. 1 %], colon cancer recurrence (CR) 12. 4 %, locally advanced primary anal cancer (LAPAC-failure of CRT/ T 3 c/d-T 4) [3. 0 %] and anal cancer recurrence (AR) [2. 2 %]. Among these patients 271 operations were performed, 212 primary and 59 for recurrence. These included 16 sacrectomies, 134 total <b>pelvic</b> <b>exenterations)</b> and 121 other multi-visceral exenterative procedures. An R 0 resection (no microscopic margin involvement) was achieved in 94. 4 % and R 1 (microscopic margin involvement) in 5. 1 %. In LAPRC b-TME the R 0 rate was 96. 1 % and for RR it was 79 %. The length of stay (LOS) varied from 13. 3 - 19. 9 days. RR operations had the highest morbidity (Clavien-Dindo [CD] 1 - 2 33. 3 %) and LAPRC operations had the highest rate of CD 3 - 4 complications (18. 4 %). Most (39. 6 %) of the referred patients were from other UK hospitals CONCLUSION: Advanced colorectal cancer can be successfully treated in a dedicated referral centre, achieving R 0 resection in over 90 % with low morbidity and mortality.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Improved {{surgical}} {{techniques and}} oncological treatment render many advanced pelvic tumors amenable to curative resection. We evaluated morbidity, survival, {{and quality of}} life (QoL) after extended pelvic procedures. METHODS: From January 2003 to November 2008, 85 patients underwent multivisceral pelvic resection; 87 % had colorectal or anal malignancies. Preoperatively, endoscopy and imaging procedures were performed, followed by multidisciplinary assessment. Fifty-eight percent received preoperative chemotherapy and <b>pelvic</b> irradiation. <b>Exenteration</b> was total in 32 patients and posterior in 48. Five posterior resections included partial cystectomy and 21 encompassed resection of the bony pelvis. Myocutaneous flaps were used for reconstruction in 33 cases. Urinary diversion was achieved by ileal conduit in 24 and by continent pouch in 8. QoL was evaluated prospectively in 22 late cases. RESULTS: All patients were evaluated. Clear margins were obtained in 66 %. Median duration of surgery was 680 (310 - 1, 320) min, and blood loss was 1, 800 (350 - 19, 000) ml. Morbidity was 68 %, whereof major complications constituted 13 %. Median hospital stay was 18 (5 - 70) days. There was no 90 -day mortality. Median follow-up was 24 (3 - 71) months. Local control was obtained in 77 patients. Twenty-seven manifested disseminated disease without local recurrence, two developed isolated local recurrence, and six had local and systemic recurrences. Twenty-one died after a median of 11 (4 - 55) months follow-up. Survival was correlated with clear margins and time to relapse. QoL was improved at 16 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Multivisceral pelvic surgery is possible with acceptable morbidity and QoL. Thorough patient selection and multimodal therapy are necessary to attain maximum benefit...|$|R
40|$|RF Kokelaar, MD Evans, M Davies, DA Harris, J Beynon Department of Colorectal Surgery, Singleton Hospital, Swansea, UK Abstract: Between 5 % and 10 % of {{patients}} with rectal cancer present with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), and 10 % of rectal cancers recur after surgery, of which half are limited to locoregional disease only (locally recurrent rectal cancer). Exenterative surgery offers the best long-term outcomes for patients with LARC and locally recurrent rectal cancer so long as a complete (R 0) resection is achieved. Accurate preoperative multimodal staging is crucial in assessing the potential operability of advanced rectal tumors, and resectability may be enhanced with neoadjuvant therapies. Unfortunately, surgical options are limited when the tumor involves the lateral pelvic sidewall or high sacrum due to the technical challenges of achieving histological clearance, and must be balanced against the high morbidity associated with resection of the bony pelvis and significant lymphovascular structures. This group {{of patients}} is usually treated palliatively and subsequently survival is poor, which has led surgeons to seek innovative new solutions, as well as revisit previously discarded radical approaches. A small number of centers are pioneering new techniques for resection of beyond-total mesorectal excision tumors, including en bloc resections of the sciatic notch and composite resections {{of the first two}} sacral vertebrae. Despite limited experience, these new techniques offer the potential for radical treatment of previously inoperable tumors. This narrative review sets out the challenges facing the management of LARCs and discusses evolving management options.
