SPICE1 was largely a derivative of the CANCER program, which Nagel had worked on under Prof. Ronald Rohrer. CANCER was an acronym for [...] "Computer Analysis of Nonlinear Circuits, Excluding Radiation," [...] a hint to Berkeley's liberalism in the 1960s: at these times many circuit simulators were developed under the United States Department of Defense contracts that required the capability to evaluate the radiation hardness of a circuit. When Nagel's original advisor, Prof. Rohrer, left Berkeley, Prof. Pederson became his advisor. Pederson insisted that CANCER, a <b>proprietary</b> <b>program,</b> be rewritten enough that restrictions could be removed and the program could {{be put in the}} public domain.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} of the pearlite - austenite transformation. The description of this process uses the diffusion mechanism which takes place between the plates of ferrite and cementite (pearlite) as well as austenite. The process of austenite growth was described {{by means of a}} system of differential equations solved {{with the use of the}} finite difference method. The developed model was implemented in the environment of Delphi 4. The <b>proprietary</b> <b>program</b> allows for the calculation of the rate and time of the transformation at an assumed temperature as well as to determine the TTT diagram for the assigned temperature range...|$|E
40|$|The use of LiDAR data (Light Detection And Ranging) {{has been}} {{increasing}} and is, today, {{the most commonly used}} data source for the generation of digital elevation models. Until now, there was no FOSS package able to process laser data with certain guarantees, however, SDPlib library supplies this lack. The SDPlib library is the implementation of the SPD format (Sorted Pulse Data) but also a set of tools for LiDAR data manipulation, processing and analysis. SPDlib is able to convert between different data formats, to classify the point cloud, to generate elevation models and to calculate statistical metrics. SPDlib tools are mainly used by command line, however, a new graphical interface has been integrated into QGIS desktop client. It is our intention to present here the SPDlib interface based on the QGIS Processing Toolbox and also to briefly show its use in order to produce basic cartography. A case of study is used to show the benefits that these tools may offer over other <b>proprietary</b> <b>program...</b>|$|E

40|$|The 3 D-modelling {{of complex}} {{geological}} structures {{is still a}} rather laborious task, {{because of the large}} number of different basic informations and the often complicated geometry that are characteristic for geological bodies. Therefore systems for 3 D-modeling of geological bodies often make use of high speed and large storage computers combined with enhanced Graphics capabilities, and require a considerable amount of interactive work. The present paper proposes a different approach how, for the purpose of the assessment of hard coal deposits, the geometry of stratified geological bodies delimited by tectonical elements may be modelled with reduced working expenditure. With some compromises concerning the detail of the 3 D model, we use standard PC hardware equipment, standard database and graphics software, and a <b>proprietary</b> <b>program</b> for geometric construction.

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a joint two-side masking {{procedure}} for automatic analysis of mammographic images. The primary objective is {{the improvement of}} computerized systems capability in revealing additional findings, as the asymmetrical changes of the breast parenchyma. The method allows the proper comparison of {{the left and right}} breast by progressive selection of paired small areas on the mammogram, primarily the so-called "forbidden areas", zones that need special attention in mammographic interpretation. The masking of specific areas of the mammogram requires the identification of two anatomical structures of the breast: the pectoral muscle and the nipple used, together with the breast skin line, to find paired matching points on the images for comparison. With this purpose, specific algorithms have been developed. In particular, a new method for nipple extraction will be presented and validated by expert radiologists, by the use of a <b>proprietary</b> <b>program</b> developed by the authors. Finally, an application example of the automatic Tabar masking procedure will be shown, in order to point out the potential of this method in detection of suspicious areas in mammograms...|$|E

Near-field diffraction focal spots varying in diameter from 3. 5 λ to 4. 5 λ (for the axicon of period T= 4 [*]μm) and from 5 λ to 8 λ (for the axicon with T= 8 [*]μm) are experimentally {{found on the}} optical axis {{at a distance of}} up to 40 [*]μm from the axicon for the wavelength λ= 0. 532 [*]μm. The first focal spot is found at distance 2 [*]μm (T= 4 [*]μm), with the period of the focal spots being 2 [*]μm (T= 4 [*]μm) and 4 [*]μm (T= 8 [*]μm). Diffraction of linearly polarized plane and diverging waves is simulated using FullWAVE (RSoft) and a <b>proprietary</b> <b>program</b> BOR-FDTD, which implement finite-difference schemes to solve three-dimensional Maxwell's equations in the Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates.
