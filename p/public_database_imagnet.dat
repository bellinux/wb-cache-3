The {{methodology}} was to compare the <b>public</b> <b>databases</b> values and the real values obtained from the CBERS/CCD images, bands 1, 2, 3 and 4, processed by the SPRING GIS software. The results revealed some problems in the <b>public</b> <b>databases</b> like differences in the lakes area, some non-existing municipal border lines and conflicting municipal areas. This suggests that some Brazilian WEB databases must become better and the CBERS satellite images are perfect for the determination and actualization of lake areas and other works.

40|$|Abstract Background With {{advances}} in high-throughput genomics and proteomics, it is challenging for biologists {{to deal with}} large data files and to map their data to annotations in <b>public</b> <b>databases.</b> Results We developed TabSQL, a MySQL-based application tool, for viewing, filtering and querying data files {{with large numbers of}} rows. TabSQL provides functions for downloading and installing table files from <b>public</b> <b>databases</b> including the Gene Ontology database (GO), the Ensembl databases, and genome databases from the UCSC genome bioinformatics site. Any other database that provides tab-delimited flat files can also be imported. The downloaded gene annotation tables can be queried together with users' data in TabSQL using either a graphic interface or command line. Conclusions TabSQL allows queries across the user's data and <b>public</b> <b>databases</b> without programming. It is a convenient tool for biologists to annotate and enrich their data. </p...|$|R

40|$|Chor et al [3] {{show that}} when {{accessing}} a single <b>public</b> <b>database,</b> a user is only guaranteed safety from an administrator inferring the user’s real intentions (an inference attack) when the user downloads the entire database. Although {{this approach is}} somewhat impractical, {{it is the only}} way in which to guarantee complete safety from prying eyes. Inference attacks on a user generally assume that the attack is taking place from the perspective of the Database Administrator. It is therefore implicit that there is an intimate knowledge of the database being accessed by the user. Given the nature of the Web and some of the Large <b>Public</b> <b>Databases</b> being accessed via the Web, we wish to determine if inference attacks launched on a user can be successful without detailed knowledge of the database. Can we successfully violate the privacy of a user by analysing his Web queries to the Large <b>Public</b> <b>Database</b> over a period of time? If this is possible, how can one circumvent such an attack? A search engine on the Web is a prime example of a Large <b>Public</b> <b>Database.</b> It is publicly accessible and users must abide by its usage policies. In this paper we discuss the issues involved in preparing to visualise a log of queries submitted to a Large <b>Public</b> <b>Database.</b> In particular, we discuss the environment in which the logs will be collected, analyse the states a user undergoes when submitting queries to a search engine and set the stage for future research. ...|$|R
