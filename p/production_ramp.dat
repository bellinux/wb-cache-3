2500|$|In Nintendo's year-end {{report for}} its 2016 fiscal year (ended March 31, 2017), the company {{stated that they}} had sold 2.74 million Switch units worldwide. Distribution of {{shipments}} included 1.2 million units in North and South America, 600,000 in Japan, and 940,000 in all other regions including Europe and Australia. To meet unexpected demand during March, Nintendo used air freight to ship Switch units, approximately costing an additional $45 per console, rather than the less-costly overseas shipment. Retailer GameStop reported that initial sales of the Switch were [...] "phenomenal" [...] and on track to surpass the Wii U based on their historical sales data, with merchandising director Eric Bright saying the Switch has had [...] "one of the highest attach rates of software and accessories to a device that we've {{seen in a long}} time". Due to the strong sales, Nintendo has expanded its production capacity for the Switch, with anticipation of selling at least 10 million Switch consoles during the 2017 fiscal year. Kimishima stated that having a Switch user base of 10 million [...] "will give publishers and the rest of our business partners a sense that the future of Nintendo Switch is more promising" [...] and spur further games development for the platform. Kimishima said that a key goal in their <b>production</b> <b>ramp</b> up will be to make sure they have enough Switch inventory near the end of 2017 for holiday sales, as to avoid the issue with Wii shortages that occurred during its first holiday-season period, while balancing the near-term high demand. According to Kimishima, Nintendo now believes that if they can realize 10 million in Switch sales in 2017, they expect that the Switch will have lifetime sales that are comparable to the Wii, which had sold over 100 million units in its lifetime.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} three auto {{body build}} concepts: net build (NB), functional build (FB) and integrated build (IB). Most manufacturers design and validate their vehicle launches using the NB concept. This concept {{is shown to}} be expensive, time consuming and not effective value added. Functional build has found growing acceptance as being preferable over NB. Functional build has tended to find the greatest acceptance as a die buyoff procedure for individual parts based on subassembly quality. Aspects of FB are shown in a case study where the manufacturer claimed to use FB for die development, but critical elements were omitted and opportunities lost. The integrated build (IB) process {{is an extension of}} the FB approach. It is a more inclusive process that considers the entire vehicle and requires closer coordination with product design. Aspects of IB are also shown in two case studies. In the first, IB concepts were included in the design process, which enabled the company to implement an effective material introduction strategy. The second is a comparison of the product development timelines of two companies and shows how IB concepts can shorten lead and <b>production</b> <b>ramp</b> time...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master's {{thesis is}} to develop a method that fully automates a {{trimming}} step in the production of a fiber-optical power spectrometer, based on a unique Acusto-Optical Scanning Filter. The filter is created by letting an ultrasonic mechanical pulse pass through a chirped Fiber Bragg Grating. The pulse introduces a disturbance in the grating, creating a thin optical transmission window in the otherwise reflective bandwidth. The high demands on the window requires a precise, unit dependent pulse form with unknown properties. Thus each unit needs to be trimmed to reach required performance. The manual trimming is largely a trial and error process, that contains two performance tests. We redefine one, eliminating the need to reroute the optical path and reducing the number of fiber weldings. The tests are then quantified, allowing a figure of merit to be based on weighted performance values. A brute force method, testing a large set of pulses, is implemented. The set is defined by the parameter space spanned by previously produced units. Due to the large space, the method is too time consuming. Instead it is used to measure the performance spaces of three units. An attempt to largely reduce the parameter space using PCA failed. An alternating variables method that finds local performance optima in the parameter space is developed. By using a set of several starting points, the method tends to find several qualified pulses. The method is implemented and successfully verified by trimming new units. Finally we propose where to focus improvements of the method in a <b>production</b> <b>ramp</b> up...|$|E
40|$|Long surge {{waves are}} {{observed}} at the receiving separator after <b>production</b> <b>ramp</b> up on several gas-condensate fields. Surge waves are observed as long and slow oscillations in the liquid flow rate at the outlet of the pipeline, occurring in stratified three-phase flow. One single surge wave {{can have a}} duration of one hour and propagate over a distance of 100 km. The presence of surge waves can last {{for a couple of}} days, after <b>production</b> <b>ramp</b> up, before the flow is stabilized. Surge waves are caused by liquid accumulation in the pipeline. Liquid will accumulate in low spots in the pipeline during production shut down and at low gas flow rates, because the interfacial drag between the gas and the liquid is not strong enough to drag all the liquid along with the gas at low gas flow rates. When the gas flow rates are ramped up the accumulated liquid is eventually swept along with the gas, and finally the liquid arrives at the receiving facility in surge waves. Surge waves can cause operational problems. Unplanned production shut-in can be the consequence if the total liquid volume in the surge waves exceeds the liquid hanlding capacity at the receiving facility. Three-phase surge waves are often divided into a condensate surge followed by a water/MEG surge. Such cases can lead to hydrate formation in periods without MEG return. Surge waves have been difficult to predict by the available commercial transient multiphase flow simulators, and as they can cause severe operational problems, {{it is important to be}} able to predict, control and handle the presence of surge waves. Surge waves represent the main flow assurance challenge on the Ormen Lange field. Laboratory experiments on surge waves have been conducted in the multiphase flow lab at NTNU. The purpose of the lab experiments was to find out if it is possible to reproduce surge waves in the lab at NTNU. A 57, 84 meter long test pipeline was configured with a dip geometry in the start. The lab experiments were conducted in two-phase with water and air as test fluids. Steady state stratified flow, with fixed gas and liquid flow rates, was established through the entire pipeline before the gas flow was choked and then ramped up again. This caused liquid to accumulate in the dip during the gas downtime. The liquid was then expelled through the pipeline in a wave when the gas flow was turned up again. Except for the very long wave duration and occurrence in three-phase flow, the result was waves with the characteristics of surge waves: Occurrence in the stratified flow regime, initiated because of liquid accumulation in a low spot during a change in the gas flow rate, a relatively smooth front, a low peak holdup between 7 and 17 % and ability to travel through the entire pipeline without getting totally smeared out. The wave duration was up to around 20 seconds at the end of the pipeline, which is relatively long for the relatively short and narrow (60 mm inner diameter) pipeline. The lab observations have been attempted simulated in OLGA and LedaFlow. OLGA is generally capable of reproducing the lab observations very well. OLGA predicted waves with very similar behavior as the observations for all the eight analyzed cases. The general trend was that OLGA predicted a slightly higher wave peak amplitude and a slightly lower wave velocity than what is seen in the lab observations. LedaFlow showed a much more poor performance than OLGA to simulate the lab observations. LedaFlow is only capable of reproducing a solution similar to the observations for two of the eight analyzed cases, which were the cases with highest Usg and lowest Usl. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Production</b> <b>ramp</b> up {{corresponds}} to « {{the period between}} the end of the production development and the full capacity utilization ». The manufacturing process often does not work perfectly during this early time of the new product production and some adjustments are necessary to obtain full capacity utilization. In order to assess the assembly process during this period, the train manufacturer Bombardier Transportation has created an improvement process called “VPI” (which stands for “Validation du Processus Industriel” or “Validation of the manufacturing process” in English). Its purpose is to “validate the material and the documentation for every movement independently” in order to ensure quality of final product and safety of the workers. It aims at detecting and solving rapidly safety problems and deviation from the normal process. This thesis is a case study of VPI during MI 09 contract (new trains for ¨Paris subway). It aims at assessing VPI framework and identifies possible causes of the delay in validation of MI 09 production process. Four main MI 09 production line specificities have been identified: long assembly time, low production volume, system complexity and process variability. VPI framework meets partially these production line prerequisites. VPI is a process that allows systematizing problems detection, formalizing the improvement process and managing a high number of problems with {{a clear view of the}} VPI validation. The most important drawbacks of the VPI seem to be the lack of problems detection after the initial observation, problem definition framework and root cause analysis. Four reasons could explain the delays during the realization of VPI on MI 09 contract: undetected problems, normal treatment timeframe for the improvements, inadequate objectives and lack of framework to select the best solution to solve problems. VPI may be improved by including root cause analysis, better problem definition and knowledge management between contracts. However, these methods are time consuming and a prioritization of the problem should be made. FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) methodology may help to identify the problem on which the VPI should focus on. ...|$|E

40|$|The ramp up {{phase is}} always the most risky part of any project, {{especially}} with a product material {{the company and its}} partners have very little experience with. One result of this lack of experience is frequent engineering changes to address design corrections and improvements. High levels of change create uncertainty within both the supply chain and the engineering change management systems. Just as a supplier {{may not be able to}} meet production requirements, elements of the change process may not be sufficiently flexible to account for the level of change the project experiences during <b>production</b> <b>ramp</b> up. A study of Bus Solution Systems' (BSS) Super Hotel Coach (SHC) program change management system will show that unsuitable change management system processes can cause downstream delays just as unsuitable supply chain strategy can cause the same. This thesis details a situation where the SHC program's Materials Management Department (MMD) was having difficulty with visibility into the change management system. As a result of the situation, SHC MMD did not have the ability to order parts on time. The effect was that there were an increased number of parts needed for manufacturing jobs but were not in stock, and sometimes yet to be ordered. The ultimate result of this problem, and the multitude of other problems impacting the SHC not investigated in this thesis, was a bus program that was 2 years behind schedule in early 2009. (cont.) This thesis aims to correct the SHC MMD engineering change visibility issue by examining the current state of the engineering change process through a shortage part case study and by applying supply chain management strategy principles to extract part ordering information from the SHC General Engineering Change Process earlier. This thesis also proposes a long term systematic solution that would help prevent shortages from occurring in the future. The intent of the recommendation is to reduce the chance of shortage occurrences so as to prevent further delay of the SHC program. by Sean Fortin. Thesis (M. B. A.)

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study emerging ramp up scenarios in the context of complex sociotechnical dynamic systems. These represent industrial and manufacturing companies that are facing fierce competition due to globalization and free trade, and the race to be in the market first with new products. Furthermore, for every manufacturer to launch their newly designed products in market and introduce the latest functionality attributes, or improve quality of their products, effective and fast ramp up is necessary for capturing a good market share. This makes the <b>production</b> <b>ramp</b> up a back bone in modern manufacturing; as its effective management enables faster ramp-up every time a change is brought in the quality, quantity features and fabrication at design, system and process level while integrating systems logical and physical enablers. In this context, models of ramp up scenario have been explored by setting up nonlinear system dynamic models in order to understand complex trends and behaviours for large and complex systems. Apart from that, novelty of these introduced system dynamic models is the set-up of an analogy to understand what impact they can produce when the respective parameters are perturbed and how this will affect the whole system and related sub-systems when they together form a system of systems (SOS). Prior research has demonstrated that variety, due to mass customization and personalization, introduces complexity in the design as well as in manufacturing process due to production mix. Complexity is modelled and implemented, not only at the system and sub system levels but also at machine level and product level, by improving design for assembly (DFA) and design for manufacturing (DFM). In the end, sociotechnical aspects and risk assessment involving 2 ̆ 2 triple bottom line 2 ̆ 2 impact factor analysis have been explored with respect to new product design by studying utility function and trigonometry. Finally, a comprehensive model is developed and analyzed with human behavior core attributes by applying Porter 2 ̆ 7 s theory of motivation and system dynamic. This model highlights major impacts of motivation theory, by providing intrinsic and extrinsic rewards impact on labor which enables an understanding of behavior pattern of labour in relation to work assigned.

40|$|Software defects (colloquially {{known as}} "bugs") {{have a major}} impact on the market {{acceptance}} and profitability of computer systems. Sun Microsystems markets both hardware and software for a wide variety of customer needs. The integration of hardware and software is a key core capability for Sun. Minimizing the quantity and impact of software defects on this integration during new product development is essential to execution of a timely and high-quality product. To analyze the effect of software defects on the product development cycle for a midrange computer system, I have used a particular computer platform, the Productl server, as a case study. The objective of this work was to use Sun's extensive database of software defects as a source for data-mining in order to draw conclusions about the types of software defects that tend to occur during new product development and early <b>production</b> <b>ramp.</b> I also interviewed key players on the Productl development team for more insight into the causes and impacts of software defects for this platform. Some of the major themes that resulted from this study include: The impact of defects is not necessarily proportional to their quantity. Some types of defects have a much higher cost to fix due to customer impact, time needed to fix, or the wide distribution of the software in which they are embedded. Software Requirements need to be vetted extensively before production of new code. This is especially critical for platform-specific requirements. The confluence of new features, new software structure and new hardware can lead to a greater density of software defects. The higher number of defects associated with the new System Controller code supports this conclusion. Current Limitations of Defect Data Mining: Automated extraction(cont.) of information is most efficient when it can be applied to numbers and short text strings. However, the evaluation of software defects for root cause cannot be easily summarized in a few words or numbers. Therefore, an intelligent classification methodology for root causes of software defects, to be included in Sun's defect database, would be extremely useful to increase the utility of the database for institutional learning. Software Defect Data Mining seems to be underutilized at Sun. I have barely touched the surface of the information that can be extracted from our "BugDB" defect database. This data resource is rich with history. We should extract and analyze this type of data frequently. by Lisa A. Curhan. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|I denna rapport redovisas det examensarbete som har genomförts hos AQ Mekatronik där företagets egen körkontroll har genomgått en produktutvecklingsprocess. Examensarbetet har genomförts på Mälardalens Högskola i Eskilstuna där kursen omfattar 15 hp. Uppgiften som uppdragsgivaren bett författaren att genomföra handlar om att vidareutveckla den nuvarande designen av företagets körkontroll så att den visar på tydliga förbättringar jämte den redan befintliga produkten. Inga tydliga anvisningar om vad som ska förbättras eller hur det hela ska tas reda på har tilldelats. Det har varit till författarens uppgift att leta reda på svagheter hos den befintliga designen för att sedan lösa dessa på ett bättre sätt. De svagheter som författaren ansåg hos den befintliga designen handlade om handtagets ergonomiska ställning, behållarens möjlighet att bli mer utrymmeseffektiv, låsets onödigt komplicerade konstruktion och axelns svårmonterade skivor. Efter diverse produktutvecklingsverktyg så kom författaren fram till ett nytt handtag som erbjuder användaren en mer ergonomisk form och funktion, ett lås som består utav färre detaljer samt en behållare som är mer figurutformad för att på så sätt spara in på utrymmet. This is {{a report}} of the exam the student Johan Engström {{performed}} at the University of Mälardalen in Eskilstuna in 2015, January to June to be more specific. The exam represents 15 university points and was performed over the period of 20 weeks. The orientation of the exam has been product development with further orientation in construction. Product development is something that the student finds very interesting and therefore does the orientation fit perfect for the student. The student contacted a company by name AQ Mekatronik and did after a meeting get an offer of doing his exam with them. AQ Mekatronik wants to renew their view on how their upcoming products can be developed to build new ways for opportunities. AQ Mekatronik wants the student to somehow improve the product that the company is selling today. The reason why the company wants the student to improve the product is because it can give the company some new ways to thing in the future. What the improvements more exactly will apply for or how {{they are going to be}} developed is there no directive for. It’s up to the student to find what to improve, why it should be improved and how it should be improved. The student started to plan the upcoming weeks of work so that the whole project will be so easy to follow as possible. The student has through the years at the University of Mälardalen used a product development methodology that has been taught through some of the courses the student has taken. The methodology goes after these following steps: planning, concept development, system-level design, detail design, testing and refining and lastly <b>production</b> <b>ramp</b> up. The student does not follow the methodology exactly but does instead modify it to fit the situations the student stands in front of. When the planning phase were over the student started to analyze the already existing product and the competitors’ products. By analyzing the existing product and the competitors’ products the student clearly can see what is good and bad with the existing product. After the analysis the student found some issues that the student wants to get some answers on after completing the exam. How can the product be more ergonomic, space effective and easier but still perform the same performances. Breaking down the issues results in the following issues: How can the handle be formed to offer the user a better ergonomic? How can the different details be moved to make the product more space effective? How can the shaft assembly be easier? How can the locks mechanism develop to be easier to provide easier assembly? To be able to improve the different constructions in the best way the student used a number of tools, function analysis, requirement specifications, QFD, brainstorming, Pugh’s matrix, FMEA, DFX. After the studies the student created some concepts and after some further work the concept ended to be something very much fitting for the end result. After completed the exam the student has now come to some final results. After completed exam the student has now developed a handle that is more ergonomic for the users hand and wrist and a lock that is more detail effective and also a container that is more figure shaped. The handle is using a more figure shaped handle, a rotation function that holds the hand in the same position all the time and a dead-man’s grip which allows the hand to come closer its resting positon. The lock has saved 30 % of its total detail usage and the mechanism is much easier in its design. A PCB card has been moved which means that the container can be more figure shaped which allows the container to save more room. This project has led to some clear improvements and the student can draw a whole lot of conclusions. The handle has been more ergonomic and the lock has been more detail effective. The student wanted the shaft assembly to be easier but the development would increase the costings for the company and it wouldn’t have been that much of a profit for the company...|$|E
50|$|The first {{pre-production}} Mk. VIII {{arrived on}} 21 December 1942 and was fit to a Beaufighter, revealing {{the need for}} a number of modifications. In spite of using a magnetron that was ten times as powerful as earlier models, normal detection ranges remained short, about 4 miles km. Modified versions began to arrive in numbers starting in May. As the <b>production</b> <b>ramped</b> up, these sets were sent preferentially to Mosquitoes, whose numbers built up significantly during the late summer. By this time the Jabo raids against large targets had wound down, while the Luftwaffe began their largest mine-laying campaign of the war. Through September and October, 37 Luftwaffe aircraft were destroyed on mine laying missions.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2014, SpaceX {{announced}} {{they would be}} building a commercial-only launch facility at Brownsville, Texas. The Federal Aviation Administration released a draft Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed Texas facility in April 2013, and [...] "found that 'no impacts would occur' that would force the Federal Aviation Administration to deny SpaceX a permit for rocket operations," [...] and issued the permit in July 2014. SpaceX started construction on the new launch facility in 2014 with <b>production</b> <b>ramping</b> up {{in the latter half}} of 2015, with the first launches from the facility no earlier than late 2018. Real estate packages at the location have been named by SpaceX with names based on the theme [...] "Mars Crossing".|$|R
30|$|This {{paper will}} focus on the {{paradigms}} involved in the <b>production</b> of <b>RAMP</b> software systems through several case studies. The purpose is to promote the interest of researchers to develop more specific guidelines for the production of SW systems with well defined RAMP qualities.|$|R
50|$|The first {{ship was}} the SS James M. Wayne (named after James Moore Wayne), whose keel was laid on July 6, 1942 and was {{launched}} on March 13, 1943. The last ship was the SS Coastal Ranger, whose keel was laid on June 7, 1945 and launched on August 25, 1945. The first six ships took 305 to 331 days each to complete, but soon <b>production</b> <b>ramped</b> up {{and most of}} the remaining ships were built in about two months, bringing the average down to 89 days each. By November 1943, about four ships were launched per month. The SS William F. Jerman was completed in only 34 days in November and December 1944. Six ships could be under construction in slipways at one time.|$|R
500|$|The C5 was {{produced}} in great secrecy in a separate part of the Hoover factory with its own duplicate facilities. At first the work {{was carried out by}} a small team of people in a sealed room, but as <b>production</b> <b>ramped</b> up Hoover installed two production lines in building MP7, connected to the main factory by an underground tunnel. A rolling testing stand was located {{at the end of the}} production line to test each completed C5 for faults. A mechanical arm simulated the weight of a person weighing [...] and the vehicle's brakes were tested under load. At the end of the process the C5s which had passed testing were rolled into cardboard boxes and loaded straight onto distribution lorries in stacks. Around £100,000 was spent to set up the factory.|$|R
