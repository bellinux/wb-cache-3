25|$|Secondary {{structures}} {{can also}} form by diagenesis or {{the formation of}} a soil (<b>pedogenesis)</b> when a sediment is exposed above the water level. An example of a diagenetic structure common in carbonate rocks is a stylolite. Stylolites are irregular planes where material was dissolved into the pore fluids in the rock. This can result in the precipitation of a certain chemical species producing colouring and staining of the rock, or the formation of concretions. Concretions are roughly concentric bodies with a different composition from the host rock. Their formation can be the result of localized precipitation due to small differences in composition or porosity of the host rock, such as around fossils, inside burrows or around plant roots. In carbonate based rocks such as limestone or chalk, chert or flint concretions are common, while terrestrial sandstones can have iron concretions. Calcite concretions in clay are called septarian concretions.|$|E
500|$|Ecology (from , [...] "house", or [...] "environment"; -λογία, [...] "study of") is the {{scientific}} analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology, geography, and Earth science. Ecology includes {{the study of}} interactions that organisms have with each other, other organisms, and with abiotic components of their environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), and number (population) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, <b>pedogenesis,</b> nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. Biodiversity, which refers to the varieties of species, genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem services.|$|E

50|$|Soil {{resilience}} {{should first}} {{be looked at}} in terms of soil formation and development (<b>pedogenesis),</b> a continuous process taking thousands of years - this puts into context the short time that humans have so extensively utilised, changed and depended directly on soil. <b>Pedogenesis</b> {{is the result of}} five factors: the first two are parent material and topography, which are passive and contribute to soil mass and position; the next two are climate and the biosphere, which are active and supply the energy in soil formation. Finally, there is time.|$|E

50|$|The Theory of Biorhexistasy {{describes}} {{climatic conditions}} necessary for periods of soil formation (<b>pedogenesis)</b> separated by periods of soil erosion. Proposed by pedologist H. Erhart in 1951, the theory defines two climatic phases: biostasy and rhexistasy.|$|E
50|$|The WRB borrows {{from modern}} soil {{classification}} concepts, including USDA soil taxonomy. The classification is based mainly on soil morphology {{as an expression}} <b>pedogenesis.</b> A major difference with USDA soil taxonomy is that soil climate {{is not part of}} the system, except insofar as climate influences soil profile characteristics.|$|E

Marbut championed reliance on soil morphology instead of on theories of <b>pedogenesis</b> for soil classification because theories of soil genesis are both ephemeral and dynamic.|$|E

5000|$|Pedology (from Greek: πέδον, pedon, [...] "soil"; and λόγος, logos, [...] "study") is {{the study}} of soils in their natural environment. It is one of two main {{branches}} of soil science, the other being edaphology. Pedology deals with <b>pedogenesis,</b> soil morphology, and soil classification, while edaphology studies the way soils influence plants, fungi, and other living things.|$|E
50|$|Usselo is {{the type}} site for the 'Usselo Soil', which {{is also known as}} either the 'Usselo horizon' or 'Usselo layer'. It is a {{distinctive}} and widespread Weichselian (Lateglacial) buried soil, paleosol, that is found within Lateglacial eolian sediments known as 'cover sands' in the Netherlands, western Germany, and western Denmark. This paleosol is classified as either a weakly podzolized Arenosol or as a weakly podzolized Regosol. Numerous radiocarbon dates, optically stimulated luminescence dates, pollen analyses, and archaeological evidence from a number of locations have been interpreted to show that the Usselo Soil formed as the result of <b>pedogenesis</b> during a period of landscape stability during the Allerød oscillation. Locally, the period of landscape stability and <b>pedogenesis</b> associated with the formation of the Usselo Soil continued into the Younger Dryas stadial. The 'Usselo Soil' is an extremely important and very useful marker bed that is used by European archaeologists and geologists in their research.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} work {{related to}} biogeomorphology was Charles Darwin's 1881 book titled The Formation of Vegetable Mould, Through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits. [...] Although {{the field of}} biogeomorphology hadn't yet been named, Darwin's work represents the earliest examination of a faunal organism influencing landscape process and form. [...] Charles Darwin begins his work on worms with an examination of behavior and physiology, which then moves towards topics related to geomorphology, <b>pedogenesis,</b> and bioturbation. [...] Observations and measurements of soil moved by earthworms, and emphasis {{on the role of}} earthworms in formation of humus, fertility of soils, and mixing of soils were all described in the book, which began to change the perspective on earthworms from pest to critical agent of <b>pedogenesis.</b> [...] Despite the popularity of Darwin's final work, the scientific community was slow to recognize the significance of examining the role of organisms in influencing landscapes.|$|E
50|$|He {{introduced}} {{the idea that}} geographical variations in soil type could be explained in relation not only to geological factors (parent material), but also to climatic and topographic factors, and the time available for <b>pedogenesis</b> (soil formation) to operate. Using these ideas as a basis, he created the first soil classification. His ideas were quickly taken up {{by a number of}} soil scientists, including Hans Jenny.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the late}} 1960s, soil {{chemistry}} {{focused primarily on}} chemical reactions in the soil that contribute to <b>pedogenesis</b> or that affect plant growth. Since then, concerns have grown about environmental pollution, organic and inorganic soil contamination and potential ecological health and environmental health risks. Consequently, the emphasis in soil chemistry has shifted from pedology and agricultural soil science to an emphasis on environmental soil science.|$|E
50|$|The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) {{developed}} a supra-national classification, also called World Soil Classification, which offers useful generalizations about soils <b>pedogenesis</b> {{in relation to}} the interactions with the main soil-forming factors. It was first published in form of the UNESCO Soil Map of the World (1974) (scale 1 : 5 M.). Many of the names offered in that classification are known in many countries and do have similar meanings.|$|E
5000|$|Pedology is {{the study}} of soils in their natural environment. It is one of two main {{branches}} of soil science, the other being edaphology. Pedology mainly deals with <b>pedogenesis,</b> soil morphology, soil classification. In physical geography pedology is largely studied due to the numerous interactions between climate (water, air, temperature), soil life (micro-organisms, plants, animals), the mineral materials within soils (biogeochemical cycles) and its position and effects on the landscape such as lateralization.|$|E
50|$|Pedologists are {{now also}} {{interested}} in the practical applications of {{a good understanding of}} <b>pedogenesis</b> processes (the evolution and functioning of soils), like interpreting its environmental history and predicting consequences of changes in land use, while agronomists understand that the cultivated soil is a complex medium, often resulting from several thousands of years of evolution. They understand that the current balance is fragile and that only a thorough knowledge of its history makes it possible to ensure its sustainable use.|$|E
50|$|The WRB borrows {{heavily from}} modern soil {{classification}} concepts, including USDA soil taxonomy, the legend for the FAO Soil Map of the World 1988, the Référentiel Pédologique and Russian concepts. The classification is based mainly on soil morphology {{as an expression}} of <b>pedogenesis.</b> A major difference with USDA soil taxonomy is that soil climate {{is not part of the}} system, except insofar as climate influences soil profile characteristics. As far as possible, diagnostic criteria match those of existing systems, so that correlation with national and previous international systems is as straightforward as possible.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pedogenesis</b> (from the Greek pedo-, or pedon, meaning 'soil, earth,' and genesis, meaning 'origin, birth') (also termed soil development, soil evolution, soil {{formation}}, {{and soil}} genesis) {{is the process}} of soil formation as regulated by the effects of place, environment, and history. Biogeochemical processes act to both create and destroy order (anisotropy) within soils. These alterations lead to the development of layers, termed soil horizons, distinguished by differences in color, structure, texture, and chemistry. These features occur in patterns of soil type distribution, forming in response to differences in soil forming factors.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} Traditional Ecological Knowledge {{frequently}} includes critiques {{of the theoretical}} division between cultural systems and ecosystems, interpreting humans {{as an integral part}} of the whole. The supposed distinction between culture and nature is often claimed to be nonexistent. Humans, for example, can represent a keystone species in a given ecosystem and can play critical roles in creating, maintaining, and sustaining it. They can contribute to processes such as <b>pedogenesis,</b> seed dispersal, and either increases or decreases in biodiversity. They can also modify and condition animal behavior in either wild or domesticated species.|$|E
5000|$|Edaphology (from Greek , edaphos, [...] "ground", and , -logia) {{is one of}} {{two main}} {{divisions}} of soil science, the other being pedology. [...] Edaphology is concerned with the influence of soils on living things, particularly plants. Edaphology includes the study of how soil influences humankind's use of land for plant growth as well as man's overall use of the land. General subfields within edaphology are agricultural soil science (known by the term agrology in some regions) and environmental soil science. (Pedology deals with <b>pedogenesis,</b> soil morphology, and soil classification.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Bashiru Ademola Raji, [...] is a Nigerian {{professor}} of soil science, Pedologist, geologist, {{environmental impact assessment}} expert and incumbent Vice chancellor of Fountain University, Osogbo. He is the second substantive Vice chancellor of the University. His research interest is {{in the area of}} soil survey, Land-use planning, environmental impact assessment of natural resource utilization and Pedology, the study of soils in their natural environment. It deals with <b>Pedogenesis,</b> the science and study of the processes that lead to the formation of soil and first explored by the Russian geologist Vasily Dokuchaev.|$|E
50|$|Cementation of {{underlying}} sediments by minerals dissolved in water may {{occur in a}} depression. On Earth, this often happens in stream valleys {{as the result of}} the formation of duricrusts, i.e., silcrete or ferricrete, by <b>pedogenesis.</b> Minerals for cementation can come from groundwater. It is thought that a low point like a valley focuses groundflow, so more water and cements move into it, and this results in a greater degree of cementation. Again, the cemented sediments would resist erosion while the surrounding terrain is eroded away to create a ridge or hill.|$|E
50|$|During biostasy, {{abundant}} and regular precipitation induces strong <b>pedogenesis</b> characterized by chemical alteration of parent material and intensified eluviation and illuviation of soil minerals within the surface soil and subsoil layers (the solum). These processes {{contribute to the}} formation of eluvial and argillic horizons and an increased concentration of iron oxides, aluminum oxides, and other sesquioxides in the subsoil. Climatic conditions favor a vegetative cover which protects the soil from physical erosion but abundant rainfall results in the loss of mineral ions and increased concentration of those minerals in receiving bodies of water. Abundant marine calcium results in limestone formation.|$|E
50|$|Geodiversity is {{the variety}} of earth materials, forms and {{processes}} that constitute and shape the Earth, either the whole or a specific part of it. Relevant materials include minerals, rocks, sediments, fossils, soils and water. Forms may comprise folds, faults, landforms and other expressions of morphology or relations between units of earth material. Any natural process that continues to act upon, maintain or modify either material or form (for example tectonics, sediment transport, <b>pedogenesis)</b> represents another aspect of geodiversity. However geodiversity is not normally defined to include the likes of landscaping, concrete or other significant human influence.|$|E
50|$|For soil resources, {{experience}} {{has shown that}} a natural system approach to classification, i.e. grouping soils by their intrinsic property (soil morphology), behaviour, or genesis, results in classes that can be interpreted for many diverse uses. Differing concepts of <b>pedogenesis,</b> and differences in the significance of morphological features to various land uses can affect the classification approach. Despite these differences, in a well-constructed system, classification criteria group similar concepts so that interpretations do not vary widely. This {{is in contrast to}} a technical system approach to soil classification, where soils are grouped according to their fitness for a specific use and their edaphic characteristics.|$|E
50|$|During rhexistasy (from rhexein, to break) the {{protective}} vegetative cover is reduced or eliminated {{as a result}} of a drier climate. Rainfall intensity is higher. The drier climate slows <b>pedogenesis</b> and soils no longer contribute the limestone building mineral components that characterize biostasy. Unprotected by thick vegetation or deep soils, wind acts to expose subsoil to erosion and rock to physical weathering. Freeze-thaw acts to increase the production of coarse detrital materials. The intensity of punctuating rainfall events during rhexistasy results in erosion, and the accumulation of sand and silt as sedimentary layers. During rhexistasy, the dominance of chemical weathering that characterizes biostasy is replaced by the dominance of physical weathering.|$|E
50|$|This thin, {{delicate}} {{layer of}} organic material {{can be easily}} affected by humans. For instance, forest litter raking {{as a replacement for}} straw in husbandry is an old non-timber practice in forest management that has been widespread in Europe since the seventeenth century,. At its peak in 1853, an estimated 50 Kg dry litter per year was raked at the European level. This human disturbance, if not combined with other degradation factors, could promote podzolisation; if managed properly (for example, by burying litter removed after its use in animal husbandry), even the repeated removal of forest biomass may not have negative effects on <b>pedogenesis.</b>|$|E
