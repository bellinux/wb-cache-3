5|$|Confessions is {{the fourth}} studio album by American singer Usher. It was {{released}} on March 23, 2004, by Arista Records. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2003 to 2004, with its production handled by his longtime collaborator Jermaine Dupri, along with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Lil Jon, among others. Primarily an R album, Confessions showcases Usher as a crooner through a mixture of ballads and up-tempos, incorporating musical genres of dance-pop, hip hop and crunk. The album's themes generated controversy about Usher's personal relationships; however, the album's <b>primary</b> <b>producer</b> Jermaine Dupri claimed the album reflects Dupri's own personal story.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton region {{gave birth}} to {{aviation}} and {{is known for its}} high concentration of aerospace and aviation technology. In 2009, Governor Ted Strickland designated Dayton as Ohio's aerospace innovation hub, the state's first such technology hub. Two major United States research and development organizations have leveraged Dayton's historical leadership in aviation and maintain their headquarters in the area: The National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). NASIC is the U.S. military's <b>primary</b> <b>producer</b> of intelligence on foreign air and space forces, weapons, and systems, while the AFRL provides leading-edge warfighting capabilities. Both have their headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is one of the Air Force's largest air base wings. The installation generated a total economic impact in the Dayton area of $4.67billion in fiscal year 2011, a decline from $5.1billion in fiscal year 2009. In addition, state officials are working to make the Dayton region a hub and a leader for UAV research and manufacturing.|$|E

50|$|Marine environments {{can have}} {{inverted}} biomass pyramids. In particular, {{the biomass of}} consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) {{is larger than the}} biomass of <b>primary</b> <b>producers.</b> This happens because the ocean's <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> are tiny phytoplankton that grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, terrestrial <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> grow and reproduce slowly.|$|R

5000|$|Cyanobacteria {{remained}} principal <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> {{throughout the}} Proterozoic Eon (2500-543 Ma), {{in part because}} the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation. [...] Green algae joined blue-greens as major <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> on continental shelves {{near the end of the}} Proterozoic, but only with the Mesozoic (251-65 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did primary production in marine shelf waters take modern form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to marine ecosystems as <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> in oceanic gyres, as agents of biological nitrogen fixation, and, in modified form, as the plastids of marine algae.|$|R
25|$|During {{this time}} American investors came to Pachuca, again {{updating}} the mining technology used here. From 1906 to 1947 the United States Smelting, Refining and Mining Company was the <b>primary</b> <b>producer</b> here, with output reaching {{its peak in}} the 1930s. However, by 1947, mining here had become too costly, because of political instability, labor disputes and low prices for silver on the world market. The company sold its interests to the Mexican government in 1965.|$|E
25|$|A {{carbon dioxide}} sink {{such as a}} {{concentrated}} group of plants or any other <b>primary</b> <b>producer</b> that binds carbon dioxide into biomass, such as within forests and kelp beds, is not carbon negative, as sinks are not permanent. A carbon dioxide sink of this type moves carbon, {{in the form of}} carbon dioxide, from the atmosphere or hydrosphere to the biosphere. This process could be undone, for example by wildfires or logging.|$|E

40|$|Although it {{is often}} {{acknowledged}} that effective inclusion of small-scale <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> in international chains is crucial for alleviating poverty in developing countries, few insights exist about how to build sustainable and all-inclusive food chains especially those based on scarce natural resources. In order to address challenges that marketing and development policy and institutions as well as small-scale <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> in the agro-ecological sector face in promoting sustainable practices, this paper focuses {{on the use of}} contracts. The paper investigates whether small-scale <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> would engage in contracts that oblige them to implement sustainable and quality-improving practices and if so under what conditions.

40|$|Nutrient {{limitation}} {{determines the}} primary production and species composition of many ecosystems. Here we apply an adaptive dynamics approach to investigate {{evolution of the}} ecological stoichiometry of <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> {{and its implications for}} plant‐herbivore interactions. The model predicts a trade‐off between the competitive ability and grazing susceptibility of <b>primary</b> <b>producers,</b> driven by changes in their nutrient uptake rates. High nutrient uptake rates enhance the competitiveness of <b>primary</b> <b>producers</b> but also increase their nutritional quality for herbivores. This trade‐off enables coexistence of nutrient exploiters and grazing avoiders. If herbivores are not selective, evolution favors runaway selection toward high nutrient uptake rates of the <b>primary</b> <b>producers.</b> However, if herbivores select nutritious food, the model predicts an evolutionarily stable strategy with lower nutrient uptake rates. When the model is parameterized for phytoplankton and zooplankton, the evolutionary dynamics result in plant‐herbivore oscillations at ecological timescales, especially in environments with high nutrient availability and low selectivity of the herbivores. High herbivore selectivity stabilizes the community dynamics. These model predictions show that evolution permits nonequilibrium dynamics in plant‐herbivore communities and shed new light on the evolutionary forces that shape the ecological stoichiometry of <b>primary</b> <b>producers...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{fact that}} the {{earliest}} documented trophic cascades all occurred in lakes and streams led Donald Strong to speculate that fundamental differences between aquatic and terrestrial food webs made trophic cascades primarily an aquatic phenomenon. Strong argued that trophic cascades were restricted to communities with relatively low species diversity, in which {{a small number of}} species could have overwhelming influence and the food web could operate as a linear food chain. Additionally, well documented trophic cascades {{at that point in time}} all occurred in food chains with algae as the <b>primary</b> <b>producer.</b> Trophic cascades, Strong argued, may only occur in communities with fast-growing producers which lack defenses against herbivory.|$|E

2500|$|A {{top-down}} cascade is a trophic cascade {{where the}} food chain or food web is disrupted by the removal of a top predator, or a third or fourth level consumer.

2500|$|Meta {{analyses}} have quantified {{the direction}} and magnitude of {{the harmful effects of}} ocean acidification, warming and deoxygenation on the ocean. [...] These meta-analyses have been further tested by mesocosm studies that simulated the interaction of these stressors and found a catastrophic effect on the marine food web, i.e. that the increases in consumption from thermal stress more than negates any <b>primary</b> <b>producer</b> to herbivore increase from elevated CO2.|$|E
2500|$|Food webs {{provide a}} {{framework}} within which a complex network of predator–prey interactions can be organised. A food web model is a network of food chains. Each food chain starts with a <b>primary</b> <b>producer</b> or autotroph, an organism, such as a plant, which is able to manufacture its own food. Next in the chain is an organism that feeds on the <b>primary</b> <b>producer,</b> and the chain continues in this way as a string of successive predators. The organisms in each chain are grouped into trophic levels, based on how many links they are removed from the primary producers. The length of the chain, or trophic level, {{is a measure of}} the number of species encountered as energy or nutrients move from plants to top predators. Food energy flows from one organism to the next and to the next and so on, with some energy being lost at each level. [...] At a given trophic level there may be one species or a group of species with the same predators and prey.|$|E
