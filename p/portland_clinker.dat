5000|$|In {{keeping with}} its high basicity, tricalcium {{aluminate}} reacts most strongly with water {{of all the}} calcium aluminates, {{and it is also}} the most reactive of the <b>Portland</b> <b>clinker</b> phases.

To avoid this, Portland-type cements include a small addition of calcium sulfate (typically 4-8%). Sulfate ions in solution lead to the formation of an insoluble layer of ettringite (3CaO·Al2O3·3CaSO4·32H2O) over the surface of the aluminate crystals, passivating them.
