40|$|Transformerless {{inverters}} {{technology in}} photovoltaic systems offers many advantages, {{but there are}} some safety issues due to the solar panel parasitic capacitance. The parasitic capacitance value depends on many factors such as PV panels and frame structure, surface of the cells, distance between the cells, module frame, weather conditions (e. g., humidity) and the amount of dust covering the PV panel. Harsh climate like the one in the Central Queensland region is characterized by high temperature, high relative humidity. Due to the region’s high dew point, high humidity and heavy rain during the wet season, the water condensed over the PV array surface will affect the stray capacitance significantly and consequently, the system leakage current. Human safety in PV system is a key issue, which must be addressed when this technology is applied. <b>Protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>shock</b> is essential while deploying such systems to avoid injury or loss of life.

30|$|Such experiences, and fatal accidents, led to {{regulations}} to improve electrical safety. It also spurred X-ray manufacturers {{to improve their}} systems. By 1935 nearly all new systems were electrically shockproof. Two important developments that facilitated this transition were {{the introduction of the}} Coolidge hot cathode tube in 1913 and the development of flexible shielded high-voltage cable a few years before 1930. The first replaced the erratic gas tube that required more or less continuous surveillance, frequent tube exchanges and thus easy access. The Coolidge tube was more reliable and high-voltage and tube current could be adjusted independently. Ironically, it was also these latter characteristics and the higher loadability which had led to more dangerous systems. Later, the reliability of the Coolidge tube allowed its placement in a well-shielded housing, giving <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> radiation and <b>electrical</b> <b>shock.</b> The flexible high-voltage cable made the complicated and dangerous conducting system between power supply and X-ray tube obsolete.|$|R

40|$|People using {{electrical}} installations {{have to be}} protected <b>against</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>shock.</b> For purposes of protection a distinction is made between direct and indirect contact. Direct contact is contact with a live conductor. Protection {{is provided by the}} insulation of cables or the screening of live parts. An indirect contact happens when someone touches exposed metal parts which are not intended to carry current but have become live {{as a result of a}} fault. In this case metallic parts raise the metal to a dangerous potential (contact voltage). Here protection is provided by connecting the exposed metal part (i. e. the case of the electrical machine) to the earthing point of the installation. A protective device will disconnect the circuit as soon as a fault current flows to earth. The earth fault value will depend on the impedance of the path taken by the fault current, which is known as the earth fault loop. The resistance of the earth electrode plays an important role in the final impedance of the earth fault loop, especially when the neutral of the transformer is earthed without any impedance. A good earth electrode should have the lowest possible value compared with the rest of the earth loop (voltage divisor). If this can be achieved, the contact voltage will be limited and the current that trips the protections will be of a higher value. The maximum duration of a contact voltage is established according to IEC 60364 - 4 413. 1. 1. 1.

40|$|Purpose - A {{saturated}} {{iron core}} superconducting fault current limiter (SISFCL) {{has an important}} role to play in the present-day power system, providing effective <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>electrical</b> faults and thus ensuring an uninterrupted supply of electricity to the consumers. Previous mathematical models developed to describe the SISFCL use a simple flux density-magnetic field intensity curve representing the ferromagnetic core. As the magnetic state of the core affects the efficient working of the device, this paper aims to present a novel approach in the mathematical modeling of the device with the inclusion of hysteresis. Design/methodology/approach - The Jiles-Atherton's hysteresis model is utilized to develop the mathematical model of the limiter. The model is numerically solved using MATLAB. To support the validity of model, finite element model (FEM) with similar specifications was simulated. Findings - Response of the limiter based on the developed mathematical model is in close agreement with the FEM simulations. To illustrate the effect of the hysteresis, the responses are compared by using three different hysteresis characteristics. Harmonic analysis is performed and comparison is carried out utilizing fast Fourier transform and continuous wavelet transform. It is observed that the core with narrower hysteresis characteristic not only produces a better current suppression but also creates a higher voltage drop across the DC source. It also injects more harmonics in the system under fault condition. Originality/value - Inclusion of hysteresis in the mathematical model presents a more realistic approach in the transient analysis of the device.
