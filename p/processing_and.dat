40|$|Abstract. A {{wide variety}} of {{different}} types of virtual computer are available in cloud computing, each with different usage costs for <b>processing</b> performance <b>and</b> time. Consequently, similar processing tasks can incur different <b>processing</b> times <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> costs depending on the choice of method used to accomplish them. Since the amounts of time and money that can be spent on processing are not infinite, the <b>processing</b> time <b>and</b> usage costs must be reduced as much as possible. In this study, we investigate the allocation of resources in a cloud computing environment with the aim of achieving lower <b>processing</b> times <b>and</b> usage costs...|$|R
5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend {{to stick}} {{to each other in}} the dense disk environment, leading to the formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> coagulation are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead to the formation of planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are the building blocks of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E
