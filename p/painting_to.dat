5|$|Beyond is the Mediterranean Sea and {{the island}} of Cyprus. Here, a {{transition}} in hue is made, from the browns that prevail in {{the lower half of}} the <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> the aquas that saturate the upper half. The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.|$|E

5|$|During 1983–1984, the {{painting}} was exhibited at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm, and after this exhibit an art dealer offered to donate or sell the <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> Nationalmuseum. The board rejected the offer {{with the statement that}} the Old Norse motif was more appropriate for the Museum of National Antiquities, which at the time still shared the same building as Nationalmuseum. When the Museum of National Antiquities had been moved to a building of its own, {{the painting}} should be moved there too.|$|E
5|$|Elements of {{the canvas}} refer to Grünewald's c. 1512–16 Isenheim Altarpiece and Peter Paul Rubens's c. 1612–14 Descent from the Cross. According to the art critic Hugh Davies, the open mouth of the victim and the {{predator}} leaning over the cross link the <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> Rubens' Descent. The mouth in Rubens' painting is loosely opened, but in Bacon's it is taut. The main figure's legs are folded out of view and the figure's left arm is passive in Rubens' painting, but in the Bacon's painting the chimera's legs and arms are in violent motion, seemingly wildly flailing up and down.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Antestor {{recorded}} a promotional CD titled Kongsblod. The promo-CD caught {{the interest of}} British Cacophonous Records, {{one of the biggest}} labels with experience in the black metal style and helped established groups such as Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir start their career. Cacophonous signed a record deal for 2 albums with Antestor. In 1998, Cacophonous released Kongsblod under a different name, The Return of the Black Death, and changed the original cover art of a famous Norwegian <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> artwork by Joe Petagno, a well-known American heavy metal cover art creator.|$|E

5|$|In February 2014, Men of the Docks, by U.S. artist George Bellows, {{was bought}} by the National Gallery for $25.5million (£15.6million). It {{was the first major}} American <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> be {{purchased}} by the Gallery. Director Nicholas Penny termed the painting a new direction for the Gallery – a non-European painting in a European style. Its sale was controversial in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In July 1892, Curtis sent a {{photograph}} of the Lotto <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> Leech, who consulted with Barber and replied that the engraver could not work from a painting in which the subject faces forward. So that Barber could depict Columbus in profile, Curtis arranged for a little-known Washington, D.C. sculptor, Ulric Stonewall Jackson Dunbar, to create a bust based on the painting at the Company's expense; when complete it was forwarded to Barber in Philadelphia. Barber prepared sketches based on the bust on August 15, and presented them to Acting Mint Director Robert E. Preston (Leech was on vacation), who forwarded them to fair authorities in Chicago. Ellsworth showed them to artists working on the exposition, and to the press. The artistic reaction was negative, and the newspapers suggested that the sketches resembled more a long-haired professor than the celebrated mariner. This controversy, coupled with his anger from public debate over whether the painting actually was of Columbus, caused Ellsworth to refuse permission for his <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> be used.|$|E
5|$|In the centre, {{the women}} dance. Their {{interlocked}} {{arms and hands}} create a pattern at {{the centre of the}} canvas, which acts as the focus of the <b>painting.</b> <b>To</b> the right of the central group of dancers a young man drags another woman away from the group of dancers, to join a pair of lovers who lie down together at the right of the painting.|$|E

5|$|Jovanović {{composed}} the first, and most famous, {{version of the}} The Wounded Montenegrin in 1882 while studying at the Vienna Academy. It was sold to a merchant named Schwartz in Vienna later that year. Within several months, Schwartz sold the <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> a Budapest casino for 1,000 florins. After World War II, it came into the possession of the Yugoslav embassy in Budapest, which gifted it to the Matica Srpska gallery in 1971, where it is on permanent display. It is catalogued under inventory code ГМС Y/3912.|$|E
5|$|Kent County Cricket Club won the 1906 County Championship, gaining 78% of {{the points}} {{available}} in their completed matches, above the 70% achieved by second-place Yorkshire County Cricket Club. This was Kent's first victory since the County Championship had been instituted in 1890. At a celebratory dinner in London, the Kent chairman, George Harris, 4th Baron Harris, suggested that the club commission a <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> celebrate the championship victory.|$|E
5|$|Matejko {{began work}} on the {{painting}} {{in the middle of}} January 1891, to coincide with the centenary of the Constitution. Although the painting was not finished until October, by May 3 it was sufficiently advanced to be shown at the anniversary exhibition in Sukiennice, Kraków. On April 7, 1892, Matejko transferred the <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> Prince Eustachy Stanisław Sanguszko, marshal of Galician Sejm in Lwów, and it was displayed in the Sejm building (now the main building of the Lviv University). This painting {{was one of the last}} works by Matejko, who died in November 1893.|$|E

5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing the <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E
5|$|Stories {{were told}} of Boone making one last visit to Kentucky {{to pay off}} his creditors, {{although}} {{some or all of}} these tales may be folklore. American painter John James Audubon claimed to have gone hunting with Boone in the woods of Kentucky around 1810. Years later, Audubon painted a portrait of Boone, supposedly from memory, although skeptics have noted the similarity of this <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> the well-known portraits by Chester Harding. Boone's family insisted he never returned to Kentucky after 1799, although some historians believe Boone visited his brother Squire near Kentucky in 1810 and have therefore reported Audubon's story as factual.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Malaysian batik making is {{different}} from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern being larger and simpler with only occasional use of the canting to create intricate patterns. It relies heavily on brush <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> apply colours to fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik. The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik often displays plants and flowers to avoid the interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry, in accordance with local Islamic doctrine. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception.|$|E

5|$|This {{version was}} criticised {{even before the}} museum board had had time to present their own view. August Brunius, who had {{expressed}} his enthusiasm for the Gustav Vasa painting, reacted against the choice of subject, like most critics. The choice of subject was only aggravated by {{the way it was}} presented. Brunius felt the <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> be unreal, unbelievable and not very relevant for the modern Swedes of the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|When King {{bought the}} {{painting}} {{it consisted of}} 13 panels sewn together and rolled into one piece. To more easily store and transport the painting King unstitched the 13 panels and stored them individually together with two separate panels of scenery {{used to make the}} painting a bit longer depending on the exhibition space. The 13 panels along with the two extra scenery panels bring the <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> 410 feet long according to King. The painting has, for the most part, remained rolled up since 1933, though it was donated by King to Wake Forest University upon his death in 1996. The university sold the painting in 2007 to an anonymous group of Raleigh, North Carolina, investors. The painting has been appraised at a value of US$5.5 million, but the value of the sale remains unknown. The group intends to resell the <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> a new buyer who will commit to restoring the work and building a suitable structure to house it.|$|E
5|$|While the {{procession}} was an actual historic event, Matejko took many artistic liberties, such as including persons {{who were not}} in fact present or had died earlier. He did so because he intended the <b>painting</b> <b>to</b> be a synthesis of {{the final years of}} the Commonwealth. He also felt that there was no real historic moment or location that fully captured the spirit of the Constitution, and so he, the artist, needed to create such a moment.|$|E
