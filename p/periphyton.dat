5|$|Where sawgrass grows densely, few {{animals or}} other plants thrive, {{although}} alligators often choose these locations for nesting. Where {{there is more}} room, <b>periphyton</b> grows, appearing as mats or brown sausage-shaped chunks. <b>Periphyton</b> is predominantly algae, although over 100different microorganisms help create it. Larval insects and amphibians are supported by periphyton; these in turn provide food for birds, fish, and reptiles. <b>Periphyton</b> also absorbs calcium from the water, which creates marl where sawgrass takes root.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} bedrock or limestone of the Everglades basin {{affects the}} hydroperiod, {{or how long}} an area within the region stays flooded throughout the year. Longer hydroperiods are possible in areas that were submerged beneath seawater {{for longer periods of}} time, while the geology of Florida was forming. More water is held within the porous ooids and limestone than older types of rock that spent more time above sea level. A hydroperiod of ten months or more fosters growth of sawgrass, whereas a shorter hydroperiod of six months or less promotes beds of <b>periphyton,</b> a growth of algae and other microscopic organisms. There are only two types of soil in the Everglades, peat and marl. Where there are longer hydroperiods, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Where <b>periphyton</b> grows, the soil develops into marl, which is more calcitic in composition.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Darby Creek {{and several}} other nearby creeks house most of the herptiles in Delaware County. The macroinvertebrate communities of the creek mainly consist of Limestone Agricultural Stream communities. No mussel communities have been described on the creek. In the 2000s, the dry weight of <b>periphyton</b> in the creek was 248.2 grams per square meter.|$|E
5|$|Attention {{to water}} quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a {{widespread}} algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered {{to be the}} result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural Area. Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the lake. Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys <b>periphyton,</b> one of the basic building blocks of marl in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of <b>periphyton</b> dry. Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of phosphorus by 1992.|$|E
5|$|Larvae {{of members}} of the family Glossosomatidae in the {{suborder}} Spicipalpia create dome-shaped enclosures of silk which enables them to graze on the <b>periphyton,</b> the biological film that grows on stones and other objects, while carrying their enclosure around like turtles. In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh. The larvae have specialised mouthparts to scrape off the microflora that get trapped in the net as water flows through.|$|E
5|$|Shorter hydroperiods {{of three}} or four months promote the growth of periphyton: algae and other {{microscopic}} organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. <b>Periphyton</b> is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod.|$|E
5|$|Although {{freshwater}} invertebrates inhabiting and comprising {{algae and}} <b>periphyton</b> make {{the foundation of}} food webs {{in the middle and}} lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding {{on the bottom of the}} river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) is apparent in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Further {{problems}} with the environment arose when a vast algal bloom appeared in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee in 1986, the same year cattails were discovered overtaking sawgrass marshes in Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Scientists discovered that phosphorus, used as a fertilizer in the EAA, was flushed into canals and pumped back into the lake. When the lake drained, the phosphorus entered {{the water in the}} marshes, changing the nutrient levels. It kept <b>periphyton</b> from forming marl, one of two soils in the Everglades. The arrival of phosphorus allowed cattails to spread quickly. The cattails grew in dense matsâ€”too thick for birds or alligators to nest in. It also dissolved oxygen in the peat, promoted algae, and prohibited growth of native invertebrates {{on the bottom of the}} food chain.|$|E
5|$|Of {{most vital}} {{importance}} to marshes are invertebrate animals, {{the foundation of}} food webs. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails (Pomacea paludosa), crayfish, and grass shrimp consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller copepods and amphipods that live in microscopic algae and <b>periphyton</b> formations. Mosquitos, born in water, are in turn the favorite food of 112 species of dragonflies and 44 species of damselflies in Florida. These animals are water hardy and adaptable to dry conditions when water levels fluctuate from one season to the next or through drought and flood cycles.|$|E
5|$|The Everglades Forever Act, {{introduced}} by Governor Lawton Chiles in 1994, {{was an attempt}} to legislate the lowering of phosphorus in Everglades waterways. The act put the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in charge of testing and enforcing low phosphorus levels: 10parts per billion (ppb) (down from 500ppb in the 1980s). The SFWMD built Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) near sugarcane fields where water leaving the EAA flows into ponds lined with lime rock and layers of peat and calcareous <b>periphyton.</b> Testing has shown this method to be more effective than previously anticipated, bringing levels from 80ppb to 10ppb.|$|E
5|$|The gastrotrichs (phylum Gastrotricha), {{commonly}} referred to as hairybacks, are a group of microscopic (0.06-3.0mm), worm-like, pseudocoelomate animals, and are widely distributed and abundant in freshwater and marine environments. They are mostly benthic and live within the <b>periphyton,</b> the layer of tiny organisms and detritus that is found on the seabed and the beds of other water bodies. The majority live on and between particles of sediment or on other submerged surfaces, but a few species are terrestrial and live on land in the film of water surrounding grains of soil. Gastrotrichs are divided into two orders, the Macrodasyida which are marine (except for two species), and the Chaetonotida, some of which are marine and some freshwater. Nearly eight hundred species of gastrotrich have been described.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly larvae can {{be found}} in all feeding guilds in {{freshwater}} habitats. Most early stage larvae and some late stage ones are collector-gatherers, picking up fragments of organic matter from the benthos. Other species are collector-filterers, sieving organic particles from the water using silken nets, or hairs on their legs. Some species are scrapers, feeding on the film of algae and other <b>periphyton</b> that grows on underwater objects in sunlight. Others are shredder-herbivores, chewing fragments off living plant material while others are shredder-detritivores, gnawing at rotting wood or chewing dead leaves that have been pre-processed by bacteria and fungi; most of the nutrients of the latter group come from consumption of the bacteria and fungi. The predatory species either actively hunt their prey, typically other insects, tiny crustaceans and worms, or lie in wait for unwary invertebrates to come too close. A few species feed opportunistically on dead animals or fish, and some Leptoceridae larvae feed on freshwater sponges.|$|E
5|$|Mayflies are {{involved}} in both primary production and bioturbation. A study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that the Centroptilum genus of the mayfly increased the export of <b>periphyton,</b> thus indirectly affecting primary production positively, which is an essential process for ecosystems. The mayfly can also reallocate and alter the nutrient availability in aquatic habitats {{through the process of}} bioturbation. By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients, mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production. Once burrowing {{to the bottom of the}} lake, mayfly nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills. This motion creates current that carries food particles through the burrow and allows the nymph to filter feed. Other mayfly nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms like that of the genus Isonychia. The nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle-like structures that have two rows of hairs. Interlocking hairs form the filter by which the insect traps food particles. The action of filter feeding has a small impact on water purification but an even larger impact on the convergence of small particulate matter into matter of a more complex form that goes on to benefit consumers later in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater marl prairies {{are similar}} to sloughs, but lack the slow {{movement}} of surface water; instead, water seeps through a calcitic mud called marl. Algae and other microscopic organisms form <b>periphyton,</b> which attaches to limestone. When it dries {{it turns into a}} gray mud. Sawgrass and other water plants grow shorter in freshwater marl than they do in peat, the other type of soil in the Everglades which is found where water remains present longer throughout the year. Marl prairies are usually under water from three to seven months of the year, whereas sloughs may remain submerged for longer than nine months and sometimes remain under water from one year to the next. Sawgrass may dominate sloughs, creating a monoculture. Other grasses, such as muhly grass (Muhlenbergia filipes) and broad-leafed water plants can be found in marl prairies. Animals living in the freshwater sloughs also inhabit marl prairies. Marl prairies may go dry {{in some parts of the}} year; alligators play a vital role in maintaining life in remote parts of the Everglades by burrowing in the mud during the dry season, creating pools of water where fish and amphibians survive from one year to the next. Alligator holes also attract other animals who congregate to feed on smaller prey. When the region floods again during the wet season, the fish and amphibians who were sustained in the alligator holes then repopulate freshwater marl prairies.|$|E
5|$|The Florida {{peninsula}} appeared {{above sea}} level between 100,000 and 150,000years ago. As sea levels rose {{at the end of}} the Wisconsin ice age, the water table appeared closer to land. Lake Okeechobee began to flood and convection thunderstorms were created. Vast peat deposits south of Lake Okeechobee indicate that regular flooding had occurred about 5,000 years ago. Plants began to migrate, subtropical ones from the northern part of Florida, and tropicals carried as seeds by birds from islands in the Caribbean. The limestone shelf appears to be flat, but there are slight risesâ€”called pinnaclesâ€”and depressions caused by the erosion of limestone by the acidic properties of the water. The amount of time throughout the year that water is present in a location in the Everglades determines the type of soil, of which there only two in the Everglades: peat, created by many years of decomposing plant matter, and marl, the result of dried <b>periphyton,</b> or chunks of algae and microorganisms that create a grayish mud. Portions of the Everglades that remain flooded for more than nine months out of the year are usually covered by peat. Areas that are flooded six months or less are covered by marl. Plant communities are determined by the type of soil and amount of water present.|$|E
25|$|Elimia virginica is grazer of epilithic <b>periphyton.</b>|$|E
25|$|Valvata utahensis is {{primarily}} a detritivore, grazing along the mud surface ingesting diatoms or small plant debris. In habitats with boulders on mud, the snail has been observed grazing diatoms and other <b>periphyton</b> (sessile organisms that live attached to rocky surfaces) and aquatic plants.|$|E
25|$|The base or basal {{species in}} a food web are those species without prey and can include autotrophs or {{saprophytic}} detritivores (i.e., the community of decomposers in soil, biofilms, and <b>periphyton).</b> Feeding connections in the web are called trophic links. The number of trophic links per consumer {{is a measure of}} food web connectance. Food chains are nested within the trophic links of food webs. Food chains are linear (noncyclic) feeding pathways that trace monophagous consumers from a base species up to the top consumer, which is usually a larger predatory carnivore.|$|E
500|$|Several {{ecosystems}} {{are present in}} the Everglades, and boundaries between them are subtle or absent. The primary feature of the Everglades is the sawgrass marsh. The iconic water and sawgrass combination in the shallow river [...] long and [...] wide that spans from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "true Everglades" [...] or just [...] "the Glades". [...] Prior to the first drainage attempts in 1905, the sheetflow occupied nearly a third of the lower Florida peninsula. Sawgrass thrives in the slowly moving water, but may die in unusually deep floods if oxygen is unable to reach its roots. It is particularly vulnerable immediately after a fire. The hydroperiod for the marsh is at least nine months, and can last longer. Where sawgrass grows densely, few animals or other plants live, although alligators choose these locations for nesting. Where there is more room, <b>periphyton</b> grows. <b>Periphyton</b> supports larval insects and amphibians, which in turn are consumed as food by birds, fish, and reptiles. It also absorbs calcium from water, which adds to the calcitic composition of the marl.|$|E
500|$|Critics of {{the bill}} argued that the {{deadline}} for meeting the standards was unnecessarily delayed until 2006â€”a period of 12yearsâ€”to enforce better water quality. They also maintained {{that it did not}} force sugarcane farmers, who were the primary polluters, to pay enough of the costs, and increased the threshold of what was an acceptable amount of phosphorus in water from 10ppb to 50ppb. Governor Chiles initially named it the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Act, but Douglas was so unimpressed with the action it took against polluters that she wrote to Chiles and demanded her name be stricken from it. Despite criticism, the Florida legislature passed the Act in 1994. The SFWMD stated that its actions have exceeded expectations earlier than anticipated, by creating Stormwater Treatment Areas (STA) within the EAA that [...] contain a calcium-based substance such as lime rock layered between peat, and filled with calcareous <b>periphyton.</b> Early tests by the Army Corps of Engineers revealed this method reduced phosphorus levels from 80ppb to 10ppb. The STAs are intended to treat water until the phosphorus levels are low enough to be released into the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge or other WCAs.|$|E
500|$|Two {{kinds of}} wet prairies {{thrive in the}} Everglades: marl and water-marsh community. Wet prairies are {{slightly}} elevated like sawgrass marshes, but contain abundant plant diversity. [...] Marl prairies are located where marl covers limestone that may protrude as pinnacles or erode into solution holes: depressions formed by the same processes that create sinkholes. Solution holes, however, {{do not meet the}} water table; they are filled with rain water. The surface is covered only three to seven months of the year, but the water is usually just [...] deep. Marl is created by layers of <b>periphyton</b> loosely attached to the limestone, and forms a grey or white crumbly mud when it dries. When flooded, the marl can support a variety of water plants, and dwarf cypresses may grow for hundreds of years though not exceed [...] in height. Solution holes may remain flooded even when the prairies are dry, and they support aquatic invertebrates such as crayfish and snails, as well as larval amphibians which feed young wading birds. Where the predominant soil is peat, a water-marsh community exists. Its hydroperiod is longer than the marl prairie, although its plants are less diverse. These regions tend to be on the border between sloughs and sawgrass marshes.|$|E
2500|$|Algae, {{consisting}} of phytoplankton and <b>periphyton,</b> {{are the most}} significant sources of primary production in most streams and rivers. [...] Phytoplankton float freely {{in the water column}} and thus are unable to maintain populations in fast flowing streams. [...] They can, however, develop sizable populations in slow moving rivers and backwaters. [...] <b>Periphyton</b> are typically filamentous and tufted algae that can attach themselves to objects to avoid being washed away by fast currents. [...] In places where flow rates are negligible or absent, <b>periphyton</b> may form a gelatinous, unanchored floating mat.|$|E
2500|$|According to the RCC, low ordered {{sites are}} small shaded streams where {{allochthonous}} inputs of CPOM are a necessary resource for consumers. [...] As the river widens at mid-ordered sites, energy inputs should change. [...] Ample sunlight should reach {{the bottom in}} these systems to support significant <b>periphyton</b> production. [...] Additionally, the biological processing of CPOM (Coarse Particulate Organic Matter - larger than 1nbsp&mm) inputs at upstream sites is expected to result in the transport of large amounts of FPOM (Fine Particulate Organic Matter - smaller than 1nbsp&mm) to these downstream ecosystems. [...] Plants should become more abundant at edges of the river with increasing river size, especially in lowland rivers where finer sediments have been deposited and facilitate rooting. The main channels likely have too much current and turbidity {{and a lack of}} substrate to support plants or <b>periphyton.</b> [...] Phytoplankton should produce the only autochthonous inputs here, but photosynthetic rates will be limited due to turbidity and mixing. [...] Thus, allochthonous inputs are expected to be the primary energy source for large rivers. This FPOM will come from both upstream sites via the decomposition process and through lateral inputs from floodplains.|$|E
2500|$|Dams {{alter the}} flow, temperature, and {{sediment}} regime of lotic systems. [...] Additionally, many rivers are dammed at multiple locations, amplifying the impact. [...] Dams can cause enhanced clarity and reduced variability in stream flow, {{which in turn}} cause an increase in <b>periphyton</b> abundance. [...] Invertebrates immediately below a dam can show reductions in species richness due to an overall reduction in habitat heterogeneity. [...] Also, thermal changes can affect insect development, with abnormally warm winter temperatures obscuring cues to break egg diapause and overly cool summer temperatures leaving too few acceptable days to complete growth. [...] Finally, dams fragment river systems, isolating previously continuous populations, and preventing the migrations of anadromous and catadromous species.|$|E
2500|$|Algae, {{including}} both phytoplankton and <b>periphyton</b> are the principle photosynthesizers in ponds and lakes. [...] Phytoplankton are found drifting {{in the water}} column of the pelagic zone. [...] Many species have a higher density than water which should make them sink and end up in the benthos. [...] To combat this, phytoplankton have developed density changing mechanisms, by forming vacuoles and gas vesicles or by changing their shapes to induce drag, slowing their descent. [...] A very sophisticated adaptation utilized by a small number of species is a tail-like flagellum that can adjust vertical position and allow movement in any direction. Phytoplankton can also maintain their presence {{in the water column}} by being circulated in Langmuir rotations. [...] Periphytic algae, on the other hand, are attached to a substrate. [...] In lakes and ponds, they can cover all benthic surfaces. [...] Both types of plankton are important as food sources and as oxygen providers.|$|E
2500|$|Invertebrates can be {{organized}} into many feeding guilds in lotic systems. [...] Some species are shredders, which use large and powerful mouth parts {{to feed on}} non-woody CPOM and their associated microorganisms. [...] Others are suspension feeders, which use their setae, filtering aparati, nets, or even secretions to collect FPOM and microbes from the water. [...] These species may be passive collectors, utilizing the natural flow of the system, or they may generate their own current to draw water, and also, FPOM in Allan. [...] Members of the gatherer-collector guild actively search for FPOM under rocks and in other places where the stream flow has slackened enough to allow deposition. [...] Grazing invertebrates utilize scraping, rasping, and browsing adaptations to feed on <b>periphyton</b> and detritus. [...] Finally, several families are predatory, capturing and consuming animal prey. [...] Both {{the number of species}} and the abundance of individuals within each guild is largely dependent upon food availability. [...] Thus, these values may vary across both seasons and systems.|$|E
2500|$|Fish {{can also}} be placed into feeding guilds. Planktivores pick {{plankton}} {{out of the water}} column. [...] Herbivore-detritivores are bottom-feeding species that ingest both <b>periphyton</b> and detritus indiscriminately. [...] Surface and water column feeders capture surface prey (mainly terrestrial and emerging insects) and drift (benthic invertebrates floating downstream). [...] Benthic invertebrate feeders prey primarily on immature insects, but will also consume other benthic invertebrates. [...] Top predators consume fishes and/or large invertebrates. [...] Omnivores ingest a wide range of prey. [...] These can be floral, faunal, and/or [...] detrital in nature. [...] Finally, parasites live off of host species, typically other fishes. [...] Fish are flexible in their feeding roles, capturing different prey with regard to seasonal availability and their own developmental stage. [...] Thus, they may occupy multiple feeding [...] guilds in their lifetime. [...] The number of species in each guild can vary greatly between systems, with temperate warm water streams having the most benthic invertebrate feeders, and tropical systems having large numbers of detritus feeders due to high rates of allochthonous input.|$|E
2500|$|Fish size, mobility, and sensory {{capabilities}} {{allow them}} to exploit a broad prey base, covering multiple zonation regions. [...] Like invertebrates, fish feeding habits can be categorized into guilds. [...] In the pelagic zone, herbivores graze on <b>periphyton</b> and macrophytes or pick phytoplankton {{out of the water}} column. [...] Carnivores include fishes that feed on zooplankton in the water column (zooplanktivores), insects at the waterâ€™s surface, on benthic structures, or in the sediment (insectivores), and those that feed on other fish (piscivores). [...] Fish that consume detritus and gain energy by processing its organic material are called detritivores. [...] Omnivores ingest a wide variety of prey, encompassing floral, faunal, and detrital material. [...] Finally, members of the parasitic guild acquire nutrition from a host species, usually another fish or large vertebrate. Fish taxa are flexible in their feeding roles, varying their diets with environmental conditions and prey availability. [...] Many species also undergo a diet shift as they develop. [...] Therefore, it is likely that any single fish occupies multiple feeding guilds within its lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|Pollutant {{sources of}} lotic systems {{are hard to}} control because they derive, often in small amounts, over a very wide area and enter the system at many {{locations}} along its length. [...] Agricultural fields often deliver large quantities of sediments, nutrients, and chemicals to nearby streams and rivers. [...] Urban and residential areas can also add to this pollution when contaminants are accumulated on impervious surfaces such as roads and parking lots that then drain into the system. [...] Elevated nutrient concentrations, especially nitrogen and phosphorus which are key components of fertilizers, can increase <b>periphyton</b> growth, which can be particularly dangerous in slow-moving streams. [...] Another pollutant, acid rain, forms from sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide emitted from factories and power stations. [...] These substances readily dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lotic systems through precipitation. This can lower the pH of these sites, affecting all trophic levels from algae to vertebrates (Brown 1987). [...] Mean species richness and total species numbers within a system decrease with decreasing pH.|$|E
50|$|A {{risk for}} <b>periphyton</b> stems from urbanization. Increased {{turbidity}} levels associated with urban sprawl can smother <b>periphyton</b> causing its detachment from the rocks {{on which it}} lives.

50|$|<b>Periphyton</b> is {{a complex}} mixture of algae, cyanobacteria, {{heterotrophic}} microbes, and detritus that is attached to submerged surfaces in most aquatic ecosystems. It serves as an important food source for invertebrates, tadpoles, and some fish. It can also absorb contaminants, removing them from the water column and limiting their movement through the environment.
