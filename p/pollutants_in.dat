5|$|When {{they live}} in {{polluted}} waters, bivalve molluscs {{have a tendency to}} accumulate substances such as heavy metals and persistent organic <b>pollutants</b> <b>in</b> their tissues. This is because they ingest the chemicals as they feed but their enzyme systems are not capable of metabolising them and as a result, the levels build up. This may be a health hazard for the molluscs themselves, and is one for humans who eat them. It also has certain advantages in that bivalves can be used in monitoring the presence and quantity of <b>pollutants</b> <b>in</b> their environment.|$|E
5|$|There are {{limitations}} {{to the use}} of bivalves as bioindicators. The level of pollutants found in the tissues varies with species, age, size, time of year and other factors. The quantities of <b>pollutants</b> <b>in</b> the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values. In a study of several bivalve species present in lagoons in Ghana {{it was found that the}} findings could be anomalous. Levels of zinc and iron tended to rise in the wet season due to run-off from the galvanized roofing sheets used in many of the houses. Cadmium levels were lower in young animals than in older ones because they were growing so fast that, despite the fact that their bodies were accumulating the metal, the concentration in their tissues reduced. In a study near Vladivostok it was found that the level of <b>pollutants</b> <b>in</b> the bivalve tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment in such places as harbours. The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water's high nutritional content.|$|E

40|$|The {{so-called}} "Concentration factor" (C. F.) should {{express a}} direct {{positive relationship between}} the concentration of a pollutant (e. g. metals, radioisotopes) in an organism and the concentration of the same <b>pollutant</b> <b>in</b> the water. While this index is very useful in some cases, it cannot give any information {{on the influence of}} the biota on its environment, an important topic in research on biogeochemical cycles. A new index (the Influence index) has consequently been developed to quantify the potential influence of the <b>pollutant</b> content <b>in</b> the population biomass on the habitat in which the population lives. The value of this index is calculated as the ratio between the <b>pollutant</b> content <b>in</b> the population biomass per sediment surface unit (e. g. m 2) and the concentration of the same <b>pollutant</b> <b>in</b> the water, and is expressed as water volume with the same <b>pollutant</b> concentration as <b>in</b> the water of the population habitat. The value increases with the increase of the <b>pollutant</b> content <b>in</b> the population biomass and the decrease of the <b>pollutant</b> concentration <b>in</b> the water. As an example, some applications of the index to heavy metal contaminations of a freshwater mussel (Unio pictorum mancus) population are described...|$|R
5|$|Many industrially {{important}} compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong {{triple bond}} in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, {{but at the}} same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key <b>pollutants</b> <b>in</b> the eutrophication of water systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{build-up}} {{of toxins}} and <b>pollutants</b> <b>in</b> seabirds {{is also a}} concern. Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from the ravages of DDT until it was banned; among other effects, DDT was implicated in embryo development problems and the skewed sex ratio of western gulls in southern California. Oil spills are also a threat to seabird species, as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated by the oil, causing them to lose their waterproofing. Oil pollution threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of <b>pollutants</b> <b>in</b> the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{definition}} and {{the sources of}} the particulate <b>pollutant</b> <b>in</b> the transformer oil were described in the article. The prevention and elimination of the particulate pollutant were introduced as well. The Definition of the Particulate <b>Pollutant</b> <b>in</b> the Transformer Oil The particulate <b>pollutant</b> <b>in</b> the transformer oil included all the insoluble precipitate and suspended mechanical impurities existed in the oil, such as sand, clay, metal particles, fibers, dust, etc. [1]. They were non-oil components, non-molecular state solids suspended or precipitated in the oil, tested as sphere, also called impurity particles. Particle size referred to the diameter of spheric particle, which could be divided into several grades according to the range of diameter, such as 0. 5 ~ 0. 7 µm, 0. 7 ~ 1 µm, 1 ~ 2 µm and so on. The particle concentration represented the number of the particles contained in 10 mL or 100 mL oil, also known as the particle pollution degree, which could be expressed as No/ 10 mL (number of particles in 10 mL oil) [2]. The Sources of the Particulate <b>Pollutant</b> <b>in</b> the Transformer Oil From the Refining, Caging and Transportation Process of the Transformer Oil.

5|$|Unlike {{atmospheric}} convection—the ordinary {{process of}} lower, warm air rising—inversions leave cooler air suspended below warm air, preventing the lower air from rising and trapping airborne pollutants that would ordinarily disperse in the atmosphere. Such weather events are common, {{but they are}} usually followed by a strong cold front that brings an influx of clean air and disperses pollutants before they {{have enough time to}} become highly concentrated; in this case, a cold front approaching west through southern Canada was delayed. When explained in less formal terms, the process of an inversion causing a smog event has been compared to a lid that holds in pollutants or a balloon that fills with <b>pollutants.</b> <b>In</b> general, smog events occur not because of a sudden increase in a region's output of pollution, but rather because weather conditions like stagnant air prevent the dispersal of pollutants that were already present.|$|E
