25|$|A railway {{inspector}} authorised by the Office of Rail Regulation {{inspected the}} section between Dereham and Hoe {{prior to the}} first passenger train using the track, the inspector set out rules governing the frequency of use and the necessary inspection regime that should be used on this section {{as well as the}} maximum speed permitted. The inspector limited the use of the line north of Dereham to 12 days per year for passenger trains {{due to the lack of}} operational signalling equipment in the Dereham station area and the absence of a Facing <b>Point</b> <b>Lock</b> on the points immediately north of Norwich Road level crossing, this legally means they must be clipped and locked manually prior to use by passenger trains. The speed limit north of Dereham is 15mph due to the condition of the track, the speed limit could be increased by adding additional ballast.|$|E

50|$|In 1907 the Caledonian Railway Working Timetable (WTT) {{shows that}} the 12.10pm goods from Gushetfaulds to Ardrossan via Cathcart worked Gree siding. The May 1915 'appendix' to the WTT states that - The Siding must only be worked during {{daylight}} and not during a Fog or Snowstorm. The <b>Points</b> <b>Locking</b> Frame is secured by a padlock. The Key of the Box in which the <b>Points</b> <b>Locking</b> Frame is placed, is {{in the custody of}} the Signalman at Lugton Station.|$|R
50|$|In 1907 {{the section}} was singled {{when the second}} platform, waiting-room, {{footbridge}} and signal box were all removed. Entrance lines to the siding are provided for each direction from the single line, with facing <b>point</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|R
60|$|The hair of all {{the three}} {{children}} is differently worked: the first has luxuriant flowing hair, and a double chin; the second, light flowing hair falling in <b>pointed</b> <b>locks</b> on the forehead; the third, crisp curling hair, deep cut with drill holes.|$|R

50|$|Variations on a treadle {{that can}} be {{carriage}} long include facing <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> bars, clearance bars, and train bars, depending how they are located on a track layout.|$|E
5000|$|A facing <b>point</b> <b>lock,</b> FPL or <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> is {{a device}} which, {{as the name}} implies, locks a set of points in position, as well as proving {{that they are in}} the correct position. The [...] "facing point" [...] part of the name refers {{to the fact that they}} are to prevent {{movement}} of the points during facing moves, where a train could potentially split the points (end up going down both tracks) if the points were to move underneath the train - during trailing moves, the wheels of a train will force the points into the correct position if they attempt to move.|$|E
50|$|However the {{inspection}} by Col F M Rich of the Board of Trade was disappointing; this {{was necessary to}} permit passenger operation, but permission was refused. A number of signalling alterations were required, chiefly facing <b>point</b> <b>locks</b> and signal repeaters; in addition the Company had no passenger rolling stock yet.|$|R
50|$|By the {{movement}} of individual levers, signals, points, level crossing gates or barriers and sometimes movable bridges over waterways are operated via wires and rods. The signaller chooses the correct combination of <b>points,</b> facing <b>point</b> <b>locks</b> and signals to operate, which will control {{the movement}} of each train through his or her area of control.|$|R
50|$|The long {{wheelbase}} {{meant that the}} facing <b>point</b> <b>locking</b> bars on the line had to be lengthened. It went into service in April or May 1907, and the rail motor gradually took {{up the majority of}} the passenger traffic, and by July 1907 was working the ordinary passenger trains four days per week, at a daily saving of £3 6s 6d.|$|R
50|$|Since the accident, a new {{signal box}} has been opened at Ropley, with full interlocking, which will prevent {{a repeat of}} this incident. Also, fouling bars have been {{installed}} to prevent points being moved (when the Facing <b>Point</b> <b>Lock</b> is not in use).|$|E
50|$|In Autumn 2010 {{changes were}} made to allow Cambrian and Welsh Marches line trains to depart in a southerly {{direction}} from Platform 3. An upper quadrant signal replaced the previous shunting disc and a facing <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> {{was added to the}} points. Though the track layout could already accommodate this, until the lock was added only non-passenger movements southbound from Platform 3 could be made.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, FPLs {{were common}} {{from an early}} date, due to laws being passed which forced the {{provision}} of FPLs for any routes travelled by passenger trains - it was, and still is, illegal for a passenger train to make a facing move over points without them being locked, either by a <b>point</b> <b>lock,</b> or temporarily clamped in one position or another.|$|E
50|$|The {{program was}} written in Delphi 6, a dialect of Object Pascal, by Geoff Mayo {{and has been in}} {{development}} since the late 1990s. Visually, it resembles the British Rail Integrated Electronic Control Centre (IECC), though most of the simulations do not cover areas operated by IECC-based signal boxes. It simulates overlaps, approach <b>locking,</b> time-of-operation <b>point</b> <b>locking,</b> shunt routes, warner routes, call-on routes, and more.|$|R
2500|$|Skill Shot: [...] When {{initially}} {{launching the}} ball, dropping it into Thing's scoop {{just past the}} launch ramp gives 2 million points the first time, increasing by a million each time up {{to a maximum of}} 5 million points each time. [...] Hitting a skill shot may also gain other benefits if they are active on Thing's scoop (e.g. extra ball, Quick Multiball, Thing <b>points,</b> <b>locking</b> a ball for multiball).|$|R
50|$|As of 2010 Glazebrook East Junction {{is still}} intact and remains {{part of the}} {{national}} network. The junction towards Cadishead on the original deviation is also still in place with a powered signal lamp showing a permanent red signal. This short section of track from the still live passing loop at Glazebrook East Junction towards Cadishead on the original non-deviated line is permanently <b>point</b> <b>locked.</b> The short section ends near a barrow crossing shortly before a bridge carrying a bridleway above.|$|R
50|$|North Thoresby {{signal box}} is a 7 lever Eastern region ground frame {{that has been}} {{installed}} to operate the track and signalling layout at North Thoresby. It operates two main line signals, two shunting signal for access {{to and from the}} siding, a facing <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> and a facing point for access {{in and out of the}} siding. With No.1 lever being released by the annetts key making up the final lever in the frame. North Thoresby signal box was commissioned on 7 August 2009.|$|E

5000|$|After a {{stopover}} for {{the dedication}} of the Montgomery <b>Point</b> <b>Lock</b> and Dam on 16 July, her transit was delayed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers over safety concerns. At the time of transit, she was drafting 11.5 ft at her bow and at nearly 15 ft at her stern, while some portions of the Arkansas River were less than 9 ft deep. A pair of barges were used as pontoons to lift the submarine a few feet to clear the river bottom while remaining low enough to pass under the bridges along her route, just as [...] had 32 years earlier.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the two request halts (Country Park and Northwood), all intermediate stations have the ability to pass trains on the single line. However, Highley's passing loop lacks a platform and Facing <b>Point</b> <b>Locks</b> on <b>points</b> to attached sidings, a legal requirement for passenger-carrying line, meaning trains carrying fare-paying passengers may not use this loop. However, it is frequently used for works trains, demonstration goods trains and empty stock workings. Despite this, the Severn Valley Railway offers, possibly, the most intensive service on any single line heritage railway.|$|R
50|$|As late as July 1869… the Neath and Brecon Engineer, {{admitted}} to a House of Lords select committee that if any passengers for east of Brecon arrived by train at Mount Street their tickets were collected, they were put on the engine, and run forward on the high level line to a point opposite and above the Watton station. (There was also a loop line direct from the Free Street extension into Watton Yard, but the Neath & Brecon witnesses claimed that the B&M would not let them use it, but kept the <b>points</b> <b>locked.</b>|$|R
50|$|Six years later, Shuman began robbing {{banks in}} Canada, 12 in York Region, Ontario (Markham, Richmond Hill and Vaughan), four in Calgary, Alberta, {{two in the}} Region of Peel, Ontario, and one in each of Hamilton, Ottawa and Toronto between 2010 and 2015 - 21 robberies in Canada. Shuman became more violent as the robberies progressed, waiting for {{employees}} to open the banks {{in the morning and}} holding them at gun <b>point</b> <b>locking</b> them in the vault. He managed to steal a total of about $450,000 from the robberies, most of which were successful.|$|R
50|$|The points {{failure was}} caused by the {{extremely}} cold weather that day freezing the point mechanisms. When the signalman had accepted the fish train from the previous signalbox to the North, he needed to swing the facing points (that allowed entry into the Up Platform Loop from the Up line) from reverse to normal. When he pushed the lever back into the frame he was able to engage the <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> and thus clear the signal. Unbeknown to him, the point rods had actually bent due to the mechanisms freezing up, which allowed him to place the point lever in the normal position, but actually left the points in reverse. This accident is one of the very rare occasions where mechanical interlocking has failed to work correctly.|$|E

50|$|To {{assist the}} {{operator}} in determining their functions, each lever in a frame will generally be uniquely labelled, one common method being to number the levers in order {{from left to}} right. A lever's identification may be painted on its side or engraved on a badge or plate fitted either to the lever or behind it. This may {{be accompanied by a}} description of the lever's function. Usually, a large track diagram is positioned within easy view of the operator, which clearly shows each lever number adjacent to symbols representing the items of equipment that they operate. Levers are commonly coloured according to the type of equipment they control, the code of colours varying between different railway administrations. For example, in British practice, the following code generally applies: a red lever controls a stop signal or shunt signal, a yellow lever controls a distant signal, a black lever controls a set of points, a blue lever controls a facing <b>point</b> <b>lock,</b> and a white lever is spare. Brown levers are used to lock level crossing gates.|$|E

40|$|Virgo {{is a power}} {{recycled}} Michelson interferometer, with 3 km long Fabry– Perot cavities in the arms.

The interferometer is then adiabatically brought on to the dark fringe. This technique is referred to as variable finesse, since the recycling cavity is considered as a variable finesse Fabry–Perot. This technique has been widely tested and allows us to reach the dark fringe in few minutes, in an essentially deterministic way...|$|E
