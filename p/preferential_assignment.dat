40|$|A {{distributed}} sensing/fusion network {{consists of}} more than one (spatially) separated sensors, each with possibly different characteristics and not all of them sensing the same environment. Due to their vast applicability, there has been a flurry of recent activity in the area of network design with respect to distributed sensing/fusion. Issues involved in the design of efficient networks include sensor mobility, reliability of links and capacity. This work builds on the Dynamic Expected Coverage Model proposed earlier and incorporates the issue of bandwidth capacity in the model. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation is proposed that includes first order <b>preferential</b> <b>assignment</b> with coverage and relocation of sensors. A modified column generation (CG) heuristic is developed for this problem. Computational results indicate that CG performs faster than standard commercial solvers and the typical optimality gap for large size problems is less than 10 %. ...|$|E
25|$|Within the KPA, between December 1991 and December 1995, nearly 800 high {{officers}} (out {{of approximately}} 1,200) received promotions and <b>preferential</b> <b>assignments.</b> Three days after Kim Jong-il became Marshal, eight generals were {{appointed to the}} rank of Vice-Marshal. In April 1997, on the 85th anniversary of Kim Il-sung's birthday, Kim Jong-il promoted 127 general and admiral grade officers. The following April he ordered the promotions of another 22 generals and flag officers. Along with these changes many KPA officers were appointed to influential positions within the Korean Workers' Party. These promotions continue today, simultaneous with the celebration of Kim Il-sung's birthday and the KPA anniversary celebrations every April and since recently in July to honor the end of the Korean War. Under Kim Jong-il's leadership, political officers dispatched from the party monitored every move of a general’s daily life, according to analysts similar to the work of Soviet political commissars during the early and middle years of the military establishment.|$|R
40|$|Graph {{coloring}} is the {{de facto}} standard technique for register allocation within a compiler. In this paper we examine {{the importance of the}} quality of the coloring algorithm and various extensions of the basic graph coloring technique by replacing the coloring phase of the GNU compiler’s register allocator with an optimal coloring algorithm. We then extend this optimal algorithm to incorporate various extensions such as coalescing and <b>preferential</b> register <b>assignment.</b> We find that using an optimal coloring algorithm has surprisingly little benefit and empirically demonstrate the benefit of the various extensions...|$|R
5000|$|Under the one-child program, a {{sophisticated}} system rewarded those who observed {{the policy and}} penalized those who did not. Couples with only one child were given a [...] "one-child certificate" [...] entitling them to such benefits as cash bonuses, longer maternity leave, better child care, and <b>preferential</b> housing <b>assignments.</b> In return, {{they were required to}} pledge that they would not have more children. In the countryside, there was great pressure to adhere to the one-child limit. Because the rural population accounted for approximately 60% of the total, the effectiveness of the one-child policy in rural areas was considered the key to {{the success or failure of}} the program as a whole.|$|R
40|$|Outranking methods {{constitute}} an important class of multicriteria classification models. Often, however, their implementation is cumbersome, {{due to the}} large number of parameters that the decision maker must specify. Past studies tried to address this issue using linear and nonlinear programming, to elicit the necessary <b>preferential</b> information from <b>assignment</b> examples. In this study, an evolutionary approach, based on the differential evolution algorithm, is proposed {{in the context of the}} ELECTRE TRI method. Computational results are given to test the effectiveness of the methodology and the quality of the obtained models.
