50|$|Unlike other web-based {{single sign-on}} solutions, such as Google's and Facebook's, NemID {{is not based}} on a cryptographical guarantee. While the {{security}} of for example Google's single sign-on is based on HTTPS, in that you use the domain name accounts.google.com in the browser's address line to ensure that you only send your password to Google (trusted third party), NemID is based on inputting your NemID-password on arbitrary webpages which show something that looks like a NemID <b>password</b> <b>dialog,</b> and then hoping that these pages do not steal your NemID-password. As NemID is a legally binding signature, gives access to bank accounts, and protects much personal information, this lack of cryptographical security has been criticized. There appear to be no concrete reason for NemID to not be designed with a cryptographical guarantee.|$|E
