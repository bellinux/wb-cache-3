40|$|The {{distribution}} of family Spionidae (Annelida: Polychaeta) in the Calamianes group of islands, northern Palawan, Philippines was investigated. Sampling {{was conducted in}} a total of 21 stations using a van Veen grab. The depths (m) and sediment regime in these stations were also determined. The spionids were selected for this study because this group was the most abundant polychaete family in the samples. A total of 96 individuals divided into 14 species belonged to the family Spionidae, with Spiophanes soederstromi, Spio filicornis, and Prionospio pinnata as the top three species. Overall mean density of the 14 species was 48. 8 ind・m^. A geographical pattern was observed in the {{distribution of}} the specimens wherein specimens were found only in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>stations</b> (i. e. those fringing the islands), while there was an absence of specimens in the 9 centrally-located stations (non-fringing). The Q-mode cluster analysis revealed that the distribution of Spionidae in the 21 stations was divided into 2 major clusters and 3 station groups, namely cluster 1 with the 9 centrally-located <b>stations,</b> and the <b>peripheral</b> <b>stations</b> classified as Clusters 2 A & 2 B. The absence of the specimens in the centrally-located stations (Cluster 1) was attributed to the high percentage of sand and a very low silt-clay component in these stations. A 2 -way ANOVA showed that spionid density significantly affected the observed clustering pattern. The <b>peripheral</b> <b>stations</b> were also shallower in depths and nearer to habitats such as seagrasses and mangroves. Thus, higher spionid abundance was associated not only with finer sediments experiencing low wave action, but also with areas nearer islands, which were ideal sinks for organic matter...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{resource}} partitioning proposes that competition among generalists {{in the center}} of a market can trigger a process of resource release that engenders a proliferation of specialist producers outside the center. Previous research has generally examined the relationship between this proliferation and market concentration—a correlate of competitive intensity {{in the center of}} the market. In this paper, we extend the theory by arguing that resource release also occurs as the degree of competitive overlap among producers in the center intensifies, even when concentration or other structural features do not vary; we expand its implications by demonstrating that increased competitive overlap in the market center can enhance the viability of producers positioned near the center more than those in the periphery; and we enrich and complete it by specifying the additional assumptions needed to extend the theory of resource partitioning to entry processes. Consistent with our expectations, an empirical examination of the Italian broadcast television industry, from 1992 to 2003, finds that the failure rates of both near-center and <b>peripheral</b> <b>stations</b> decline with greater competitive overlap in the programming of the national broadcasters, with the failure rates of the near-center stations falling more than those of <b>peripheral</b> <b>stations.</b> Greater competitive overlap similarly stimulates the entry of near-center <b>stations</b> more than <b>peripheral</b> one...|$|R

It was resumed in a letter dated 21 November 1975, but the district of Kassel—including the urban area of Kassel—was not included initially. [...] In 1977, the city of Kassel pressed strongly {{for the construction of}} an underground line through a station under the existing Kassel terminal station-including a tunnel under the city of Kassel. A new station building at the Wilhelmshöhe site and variants with different above ground and underground access lines were investigated. Deutsche Bundesbahn favoured the Wilhelmshöhe location with an above ground approach, the so-called [...] "western route" [...] (Westtrasse). Both options were examined in the {{regional planning}} process, which was conducted from 1978 to 1980. Flanked by numerous reports and counter reports they were discussed amid public controversy. The underground option was—in the opinion of Deutsche Bundesbahn—much more complex, more expensive and would impose greater burdens on the population. Discussions at first focused on complex problems of urban development, but gradually shifted to noise abatement issues. On 29 March 1979, Deutsche Bundesbahn opened an exhibition on the construction project in Kassel. The [...] "groundbreaking" [...] ceremony for the Hessian section was held on 13 November 1981. Ultimately, the city of Kassel agreed to the station at Wilhelmshöhe after studies had shown that this site would not adversely affected the future development of the city. High cost and long construction time led to proposals for an underground through station under the main station to be discarded in favour of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>station</b> at Wilhelmshöhe. The new station was initially designed purely as a long-distance station, which would only be used by trains running on the new line. The connection to the existing Kassel Hauptbahnhof would be carried out by shuttle trains. In the course of further planning between 1979 and 1986 {{it became clear that the}} existing Kassel Hauptbahnhof would lose its function as central rail hub to the new Wilhelmshöhe station and the Kassel Hauptbahnhof would tend to be used mainly by traffic to and from that area.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{whether the}} current provision of air services in Europe is impacted by high-speed rail (HSR). An ex-post analysis {{is carried out}} considering 161 routes EU-wide using transnational data. We use censored regressions with special attention paid {{to the presence of}} outliers in the sample and to the potential problem of non-normality of error terms. It is found that shorter HSR travel times involve less air services, with similar impact on both airline seats and flights. This impact quickly drops between 2. 0 - and 2. 5 -h HSR travel time. The impact of HSR frequencies is much more limited. Hubbing strategies led by the airlines have the opposite effect from HSR, as hubs involve more air services. Airline/ HSR integration at the airport and cities being served by both central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>stations</b> have no significant impact.

The data for Liossia and Geoponiki stations are screened for cases of strong airflow from rural areas (N-NE winds stronger than 5 m/s). The variation characteristics of the average rural ozone afternoon levels (12 : 00 - 18 : 00), with the best vertical atmospheric mixing, are mainly examined since these measurements are expected to be representative of the broader area. In all three stations there is a characteristic seasonal variation of rural ozone concentrations with lowest winter afternoon values at about 50 ?g/m 3 in December-January and average summer afternoon values at about 120 ?g/m 3 in July-August, indicating that high summer values are observed all over the area. The rural summer afternoon ozone values are very well correlated between the three stations, implying spatial homogeneity all over the area but also temporal homogeneity, since during the 13 -year period 1987 - 1999 the rural afternoon ozone levels remained almost constant around the value of 120 ?g/m 3...|$|E

In literature, no complete or generally accepted model describes the principles of micturition control. In this paper, the integration of (neuro-) anatomy, (neuro-) physiology and control theory is used to describe and model the neuronal control of the lower urinary tract. Neuroanatomy supplies the most basic information necessary for the modellation of the peripheral pathways and central connections involved in {{the control of the}} uropoetic system. It is found that not all the nervous structures and connections have been identified as such yet. The linking up between several nervous structures (e. g., the presence of central and <b>peripheral</b> relay <b>stations)</b> is not completely clear. As a consequence, each model to describe the micturition cycle from the perspective of control theory is yet of limited physiological value as it cannot exceed a rather general level of modellation. Adding functional considerations (neurophysiology and control theory) to the neuroanatomical skeleton completes the model. Some control mechanisms active during the micturition cycle can still not be revealed in detail. Crucial questions on the neuronal innervation of the human uropoetic system and the control mechanisms active during the micturition cycle remain, like how the supraspinal trigger mechanisms for micturition are organised, or how the voluntary cessation of voiding is realised.

Their classification was {{compared with that of}} a paediatrician, blind to the result of the nurses' assessment, which could be modified in the light of simple investigations, e. g. dengue serology. RESULTS: In children aged 2 - 59 months (n = 859), the nurses were able to classify, using the modified chart, the presenting illness in > 99 % of children and found more than one classification in 70 %. For the children with pneumonia, diarrhoea, dengue shock syndrome, severe DHF and severe disease requiring urgent admission, the nurse's classification was > 60 % sensitive and > 85 % specific compared with that of the paediatrician. For the nurse's classification of DHF the specificity was 50 - 55 % for the children < 5 years and in children with definitive dengue serology. Alterations in the DHF algorithm improved specificity at the expense of sensitivity.
