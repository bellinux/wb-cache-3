40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if insecticide treatment during bloom {{had an effect on}} olive productivity, three insecticides: Dimethoate (Dimate), Deltamethrine (Decis) and Oleoparathion (Oleokriss) and a bioinsecticide (Bactospeine) were studied over Coratina olive cultivar. These compounds, were applied, at variable concentrations of 100, 10 and 1 % RFR, to <b>pollen</b> <b>culture</b> medium or sprayed to field-grown trees during green-cluster stage. Their effectiveness was evaluated on the germination capacity (% germination and tube growth). When added to <b>pollen</b> <b>culture</b> medium, increased germination percentage of Coratina pollen and in vitro enhanced tube elongation were obtained when Bactospeine at 100, 10 and 1 % RFR. Germination and tube length were reduced when Dimethoate, Deltamethrine and Oleoparathion were applied to Coratina pollen germination media at 100 % RFR. Oleoparathion at 100 % and 10 % RFR inhibited both pollen germination and tube growth. In contrast, at 1 % RFR, Oleoparathion was less inhibitory. Deltamethrine at 100 % RFR inhibited pollen germination and tube growth. An intermediate inhibitory effect on pollen germination and tube elongation were observed when Dimethoate was used at 100 % RFR. When the insecticides were sprayed on the shoots of Coratina olive cultivar just before blooming, treatments showed similar trends with low pollen germination and tube growth in presence of Oleoparathion and increasing to high levels in presence of Bactopeine. Germination and tube length were reduced when Dimethoate, Deltamethrine and Oleoparathion at 100 % RFR were applied to pollen insecticide-free media. In contrast, at 10 and 1 % RFR, these insecticides were less inhibitory and showed no difference from the control. Applications of Oleoparathion most severely reduced pollen germination, retarded germination, ruptured pollen tubes and damaged stigmatic surfaces in vivo...|$|E

Using <b>pollen</b> <b>culture</b> technique, we obtained elite rice (Oryza sativa L.) line DHP 6, which is well {{adapted to the}} highlands of Madagascar. Here we show that certain grain, nutritional, and culinary quality characteristics have been significantly improved in line DHP 6. Morphometric and physico-chemical analysis demonstrated that physical (colour, transluscency, and chalkiness), chemical (amylose content, alkali spreading value, and gel consistency) and cooking (volume expansion, elongation ratio) features were greatly improved compared to the parental line. Culinary and nutritional quality analyses showed {{a significant increase in}} nutritional values and mineral richness. Some desired concentrations of minerals like Mg and Cu were much higher (e. g. three times richer in Cu) than those of its parental line (variety IR 58614). Taken together, such ameliorated grain quality traits will promote its wide-scale planting by the farmers and should thus help to improve the nutritional quality of the population of Madagascar...|$|E

40|$|SummaryFlowering {{plants in}} the {{reproductive}} stage are particularly vulnerable to ambient temperature fluctuations [1 – 6]. Nevertheless, they maintain seed production under certain levels of exposure to temperature change. The mechanisms underlying this temperature tolerance are largely unknown. Using an in vitro Arabidopsis <b>pollen</b> tube <b>culture,</b> we found that a synthetic CLV 3 /ESR-related peptide, CLE 45, prolonged pollen tube growth. A subsequent screen of Arabidopsis mutants of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase genes identified two candidate receptors for CLE 45 peptide, STERILITY-REGULATING KINASE MEMBER 1 (SKM 1) and SKM 2. The double loss-of-function mutant was insensitive to CLE 45 peptide in terms of pollen tube growth in vitro. The SKM 1 protein actually interacted with CLE 45 peptide. CLE 45 was preferentially expressed in the stigma in the pistil at 22 °C, but upon temperature shift to 30 °C, its expression expanded to the transmitting tract, along which pollen tubes elongated. In contrast, both SKM 1 and SKM 2 were expressed in pollen. Disturbance of CLE 45 -SKM 1 /SKM 2 signaling transduction by either RNAi suppression of CLE 45 expression or introduction of a kinase-dead version of SKM 1 into skm 1 plants reduced seed production at 30 °C, but not at 22 °C. Taken together with the finding that CLE 45 peptide application alleviated mitochondrial decay during the in vitro <b>pollen</b> tube <b>culture,</b> these results strongly suggest that the pollen-pistil interaction via the CLE 45 -SKM 1 /SKM 2 signaling pathway sustains pollen performance under higher temperatures, leading to successful seed production...|$|R

Some systems of plant regeneration have already been optimised in coffee. This constitutes an important achievement with implications for the micropropagation of superior genotypes obtained by conventional breeding programmes and for the application of genetic transformation procedures.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of chromium by germinating kiwifruit pollen {{appears to be}} significantly affected by Cr species, Cr concentration and calcium availability. Cr(III) accumulation always occurred in a linear manner while Cr(VI) uptake followed a logarithmic model. In the absence of exogenous calcium, Cr(III) accumulation was much {{higher than that of}} Cr(VI). It was observed that, as the Cr(III) concentration increased, there was a significant decrease in the endogenous calcium content of pollen, ultimately leading to complete calcium depletion after 90 min of incubation at 150 µM Cr(III). This loss of calcium could be responsible for the strong inhibition of tube emergence and growth following exposure of pollen to Cr(III). Indeed, when exogenous calcium was added to the kiwifruit <b>pollen</b> <b>culture</b> medium, significant growth recovery and reduced Cr(III) uptake occurred; the opposite was true in Cr(VI) -treatments. A significant rise in lipid peroxide production occurs in the presence of both Cr species; the effect was more pronounced following Cr(VI) exposure. Finally, glutathione pool dynamics appears to be differentially affected by chromium species and concentrations. In conclusion, {{results of the present study}} have provided important information regarding the different activity profiles of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in relation to kiwifruit pollen performance, and have also demonstrated differences in some biochemical responses of pollen to metal stress...|$|E
40|$|The native mycobiota of five grape {{varieties}} {{grown in}} Spain has been studied. Four (Bobal, Tempranillo, Garnacha, and Monastrell) were red varieties and one (Moscatel) was white. The main fungal genera isolated were Alternaria, Cladosporium, and Aspergillus. The isolation frequency of Aspergillus spp. section Nigri in contaminated samples was 82 %. Ochratoxin A (OTA) production {{was assessed using}} yeast extract-sucrose broth supplemented with 5 % bee <b>pollen.</b> <b>Cultures</b> of 205 isolates from this section showed that 74. 2 % of Aspergillus carbonarius and 14. 3 % of Aspergillus tubingensis isolates produced OTA at levels ranging from 1. 2 to 3, 530 ng/ml and from 46. 4 to 111. 5 ng/ml, respectively. No Aspergillus niger isolate {{had the ability to}} produce this toxin under the conditions assayed. Identification of the A. niger aggregate isolates was based on PCR amplification of 5. 8 S rRNA genes and its two intergenic spacers, internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) and ITS 2, followed by digestion with restriction endonuclease RsaI of the PCR products. The restriction patterns were compared with those from strains of A. niger CECT 2807 and A. tubingensis CECT 20393, held at the Spanish Collection of Type Cultures. DNA sequencing of the ITS 1 - 5. 8 S rRNA gene-ITS 2 region of the OTA-producing isolates of A. tubingensis matched 99 to 100 % with the nucleotide sequence of strain A. tubingensis CBS 643. 92.

40|$|In lily (Lilium longiflorum cv. Avita) pollen cold-stored (- 20 degreesC) for 2 months, {{typical in}} vitro germination/growth was delayed by about 1 h {{compared}} with fresh pollen. We hypothesized that some proteins and mRNAs stored in mature pollen were degraded during storage periods and that re-synthesis {{of them was}} essential to resume normal germination and growth. Cold-stored and fresh pollen grains were used to investigate the regulatory mechanism of pollen germination and tube growth {{in terms of both}} total protein profile and gene expression. Total protein profiles of cold-stored pollen differed qualitatively and quantitatively from fresh pollen. Actinomycin D significantly inhibited both germination and tube growth of cold-stored pollen and later tube growth of fresh pollen but had no effect on fresh pollen germination and early tube growth. Suppression subtractive hybridization screening revealed 99 cDNAs enriched in fresh mature pollen, and 22 were selected for further characterization. Most of these 22 cDNAs gradually disappeared during cold storage, but full recovery was achieved by incubating the cold-stored <b>pollen</b> in <b>culture</b> medium for 2 h. Because of different sensitivities to cold storage and actinomycin D, the transcripts were divided into three groups according to their possible roles in pollen germination and tube growth. Several cDNAs encoding novel proteins showed pollen-specific expression patterns and may participate in drought tolerance (an Na+/H+ antiporter), endomembrane trafficking (DnaJ), division of the generative cell (Sgt 1), pollen wall precursor uptake from stylar exudate (an Na+/myoinositol symporter) and chemotropism of the pollen tube (peptide transporter) during pollination...|$|R

40|$|Immature pollen of Nicotiana tabacum cv Wisconsin 38 and cv Burley, {{isolated}} at stages {{from the}} late uninucleate to early bicellular, was successfully cultured to give embryoids and green plantlets. This is the first report of successful culture of tobacco pollen isolated direct from the plant. The method represents a substantial advance on existing methods which relied on both prior treatment of the excised buds and {{a short period of}} anther culture, to induce the pollen into embryogenesis, The pollen was isolated and pretreated for about 7 days in an appropriate medium. For bicellular pollen, from which the largest number of embryoids was obtained, this medium was simply water; for uninucleate pollen, which required a higher osmotic pressure for survival, it was a solution of inorganic salts. After the pretreatment, nutrient medium with sucrose was added, upon which embryoids and plantlets formed. Not more than 6 % of the pollen grains developed into microscopic embryoids. Still fewer survived to become plantlets. Attempts to induce more pollen grains into embryogenesis by means of growth substances and other empirical modifications of the pretreatment medium were unsuccessful. Plantlet yields were increased by increasing nutrient availability after the pretreatment. The low fraction of pollen grains induced into embryogenesis was consistent with findings of previous workers which suggested that embryogenesis is predetermined by events that precede culture. Isolation of the pollen into the complete nutrient medium instead of into water was deleterious to embryogenesis. This contrasts markedly with the situation in anther culture in which high yields of pollen plantlets can be obtained by supplying the complete medium at inoculation. The deleterious effect of sucrose and other organic compounds on embryogenesis in the case of isolated pollen suggests that in anther culture the anther tissues act as a screening agent preventing access of the deleterious compounds to the pollen during the initial induction period. Attempts to culture isolated pollen of N. sylvestris were less successful. A few microscopic embryoids were obtained, but none developed into plantlets. Isolated pollen of N. sylvestris may have more stringent nutritional and osmotic requirements than that of N. tabacum. Changes in the anatomy of N. sylvestris anthers during culture were investigated. They could not be correlated with the potential for embryogenesis. Details of anther and pollen development were, studied in Hevea brasiliensis as a preliminary to anther and <b>pollen</b> <b>culture</b> studies.

40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is to investigate {{the possibility of using}} pollen as a vector for transporting extracellular substances to the site of gamete fusion in the embryo sac. Manipulation of plant male and female gametophytes included studies on <b>pollen</b> <b>culture</b> in vitro, pollen viability and developmental state, loading of fluorescent probes by plasmolysis/endocytosis and via vascular system, clearance of embryo sacs, ovule culture and the in vitro fertilisation and production of genetically uniform lines. Pollen from Impatiens glanduiifera cultured under a range of nutrients (sucrose, H(_ 3) B(_O 4), Ca. K and Mg), temperature and humidity conditions revealed that 5 % sucrose, lOOppm H(_ 3) BO(_ 4) with 100 ppm potassium nitrate, gave longer pollen tubes (463. 20 pm after 1 h). Pollen tubes were longer at room temperature; however, they also grew under temperatures down to 4 C. The effect of humidity levels was also significant, and pollen tube length increased with the increase of relative humidity (RH) over the range 0. 0 to 92. 0 %. Plasmolysis followed by deplasmolysis of pollen gave a non-significant effect on tube growth compared to the control treatment. Assessment of pollen viability using fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and Calcofluor White M 2 R (CFW) highlighted some drawbacks on the most widely used technique for assessing pollen viability, the fluorochromatic reaction. Pollen developmental state in I. glandulifera was assessed using the Feulgen staining technique. The use of DNA-specific 4, 6 -diamidino- 2 - phenyl indole (DAPl) has clearly shown the vegetative and generative nuclei. Pollen tubes were monitored using aniline blue. When pollen were plasmolysed and deplasmolysed in the presence of 5 mg ml (^- 1) Lucifer Yellow CH (LY-CH), the fluorescent probe was taken into pollen and the most likely mechanism by which it was taken up was through plasmolysis/endocytosis. The loading up into pollen of FDA by enzymic cleavage and fluorescein by endocytosis is also discussed. Fluorescein, LY-CH and Calcofluor White M 2 R were loaded via the vascular system of Nicotiana tabacum, I. glandulifera and Brassica napus. Using fluorescence microscopy, the path of these probes was followed from the pedicel cells up to the ovules. The demonstration of loading of fluorescent probes into embryo sacs, whether via germinating pollen or via the vascular system, required manipulation of ovaries and clearance of embryo sacs. The fixing and clearing technique revealed, to some extent, embryo elements in I. glandulifera and N. tabacum. The enzymic maceration technique, however, resulted in the isolation of I. glandulifera embryo sacs. The embedding in London Resin White (LR White) technique was used to reveal additional information. In vitro stigmatal pollination of I. glandulifera ovaries resulted in pollen tubes penetrating into the ovules. When this was conducted in the presence of Lucifer Yellow CH, B. napus pollen tubes were seen carrying the probe and penetrating into the ovule. Fully grown N. tabacum plants were obtained from ovaries cultured and pollinated in vitro. Micro-propagation of I. glandulifera, N. tabacum and B. napus in Murishige and Skoog, and Nitsch and Nitsch -based media resulted in plantlets from B. napus and Nicotiana tabacum.

40|$|Pollen {{tubes are}} polarly growing plant {{cells that are}} able to respond to a {{combination}} of chemical, mechanical, and electrical cues during their journey through the flower pistil in order to accomplish fertilization. How signals are perceived and processed in the pollen tube is still poorly understood and evidence for electrical guidance, in particular, is vague and highly contradictory. To generate reproducible experimental conditions for ex vivo <b>pollen</b> cell <b>cultures,</b> here we present a low-cost, reusable Electrical Lab-on-a-Chip (ELoC) for investigating the influence of electric fields on growing cells. Viability of pollen growth using a structured microfluidic network is first investigated and validated. Then the integration of microelectrodes into the device is addressed in detail. Characterization of the pollen growth medium conductivity and simulation of the ELoC electrical configuration were carried out to define the experimental conditions. Reusability of the microdevice is achieved by structuring the design into two separate rebondable modules: a microfluidic module and a microelectrode module. Two experimental approaches were realized: a batch design for exposing simultaneously a large number of cells to a global electric field, and a single-cell design in which a localized electric field is applied to individual cells. Extensive batch results indicate that DC fields were inhibitory above 6 V/cm. However, switching to AC fields re-established pollen tube growth at frequencies above 100 mHz, suggesting a significant role of the medium conductivity in controlling the cellular response. Unlike macroscopic open-assay experimental setups, single-cell tests further indicate no reorientation of pollen tube growth, suggesting that previously reported tropic behavior was caused by ion movement in the substrate rather than by a direct effect of the electric field on the cell...|$|R

An intriguing and useful example is that immature pollen cultured in vitro can pass through embryogenic development to form haploid or doubled haploid plants. However, {{a lack of}} understanding the initial mechanisms of pollen embryogenesis hampers the improvement and more effective and widespread employment of haploid technology in plant research and breeding. To investigate the cellular dynamics during the onset of pollen embryogenesis, we used time-lapse imaging along with transgenic barley expressing nuclear localized Green Fluorescent Protein. The results enabled us to identify nine distinct embryogenic and non-embryogenic types of pollen response to the culture conditions. Cell proliferation in embryogenic pollen normally started via a first symmetric mitosis (54. 3 % of pollen observed) and only rarely did so via asymmetric pollen mitosis I (4. 3 % of pollen observed).

40|$|Pollen tube {{cell volume}} changes rapidly in {{response}} to perturbation of the extracellular osmotic potential. This report shows that specific phospholipid signals are differentially stimulated or attenuated during osmotic perturbations. Hypo-osmotic stress induces rapid increases in phosphatidic acid (PA). This response occurs starting at the addition of 25 % (v/v) water to the <b>pollen</b> tube <b>cultures</b> and peaks at 100 % (v/v) water. Increased levels of PA were detected within 30 s and reached maximum by 15 to 30 min after treatment. The pollen tube apical region undergoes a 46 % increase in cell volume after addition of 100 % water (v/v), {{and there is an}} average 7 -fold increase in PA. This PA increase appears to be generated by phospholipase D because concurrent transphosphatidylation of n-butanol results in an average 8 -fold increase in phosphatidylbutanol. Hypo-osmotic stress also induces an average 2 -fold decrease in phosphatidylinositol phosphate; however, there are no detectable changes in the levels of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphates. In contrast, salt-induced hyperosmotic stress from 50 to 400 mm NaCl inhibits phospholipase D activity, reduces the levels of PA, and induces increases in the levels of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate isomers. The pollen tube apical region undergoes a 41 % decrease in cell volume at 400 mm NaCl, and there is an average 2 -fold increase in phosphatidylinositol 3, 5 -bisphosphate and 1. 4 -fold increase in phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate. The phosphatidylinositol 3, 5 -bisphosphate increase is detected within 30 s and reaches maximum by 15 to 30 min after treatment.

40|$|Fertilization, both {{in plants}} and animals, {{is at its}} core, a study of cell to cell communication. With respect to plants, the male gametophyte, the pollen tube, elongates within the female organ called the pistil, {{transporting}} in its cytoplasm two sperm cells. The pollen tube is attracted by signals secreted from the synergid cells that are located {{at the entrance to}} the female gametophyte that resides in the ovule. Secondary pollen tube visitors to the ovules are unwanted and repelled presumably by signals emitted by the fertilized female. The final communication between the pollen tube and female gametophyte is the induction of pollen tube rupture upon penetration of the synergid cell, an event that leads to the release of the two sperm cells, which go on to fertilize the central cell and egg cell within the female gametophyte, completing a double fertilization process that is unique to plants. My thesis research is centered on elucidating the mechanism behind the synergid cell-induced pollen tube rupture process. Studies in our laboratory have established that the synergid cell-expressed receptor like kinase, called FERONIA, mediates a highly oxidative environment in the female gematophyte that is necessary for the pollen tube rupture process. Using an in vitro <b>pollen</b> tube <b>culture</b> system, my research showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces pollen tube rupture in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner. My results suggests a careful and truly fascinating, though still hypothetical, design of a two molecule, FERONIA and ROS, two step activation system that uses ROS to prime the pollen tube outside the synergid cell, then expose it to calcium within the synergid cell to ensure that pollen tube rupture happens in the synergid cell, enabling fertilization...|$|R
40|$|Pollen tubes {{navigate}} the route from stigma to ovule with great accuracy, but the cues that guide them along this route are not known. We reproduced the environment on {{the stigma of}} Nicotiana alata by immersing pollen in stigma exudate or oil close to an interface with an aqueous medium.

The rate-limiting step in pollen germination was the movement of water through the surrounding exudate or oil. By elimination of other potential guidance cues, we conclude that the directional supply of water probably determined the axis of polarity of pollen tubes and resulted in growth toward the interface. We propose that a gradient of water in exudate is a guidance cue for pollen tubes on the stigma and that {{the composition of the}} exudate must be such that it is permeable enough for pollen hydration to occur but not so permeable that the supply of water becomes nondirectional.

Speciﬁcally, two stages of anther development were tested (corresponding to tetrad cells or uninucleate <b>pollen),</b> and direct <b>culture</b> of anthers was compared to culture after a cold treatment of inﬂorescences (4 °C during 48 h). In addition, two induction media (C 1 P and B 2), mainly differing by microelement and cytokinin levels, were evaluated. Experiment repeatability was also examined with a repetition of anther culture one week later. Callus initiation was similar in all media and treatments for both cultivars, usually starting from the anther ﬁlament. A simple protocol for efﬁcient induction of embryogenesis in 'Macabeo' and 'Tempranillo' consisted in: (i) selecting the ﬁrst inﬂorescence from hardwood cutting, (ii) excising anthers at uninucleate pollen stage without cold treatment of the inﬂorescences, (iii) incubating anthers on C 1 P medium. The procedure used for embryo germination and plant regeneration, allowed to obtain a conversion rate up to 75 % in 'Macabeo' and 60 % in 'Tempranillo'. The protocol proposed represents the ﬁrst regeneration system developed for the Spanish cultivars 'Macabeo' and 'Tempranillo'...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{embodies the}} modern pollen rain-vegetation {{relationship}} from sub-tropical belt, India. Palynological study {{was carried out}} on ten samples collected at sediment-water interface from lake-Bari Tal, Lucknow (UP). The quantitative and qualitative analysis of pollen and spores reveals the dominance of non-arboreals and relatively extremely low frequencies of arboreals (trees & shrubs). Among the tree taxa, Madhuca indica (av. 6. 8 %) and Acacia (av. 4. 7 %) are the major components and they are consistently represented with collectively av. 11. 5 % pollen, whereas rest of the trees viz., Holoptelea, Bauhinia, Terminalia, Shorea robusta, Syzygium, Emblica officinalis, members of Meliaceae, etc., are meagre although they are common in the region. The under-representation of all these taxa {{could be due to}} low pollen production and entomophilly. The partial preservation of their pollen in the sediments cannot be denied. In general, the trees taxa constitute av. 22. 5 % fraction of the total pollen rain and it does not reflect their actual composition in the extant vegetation, despite their sparse presence in the area. The representation of grasses, sedges, Cheno/Am, Caryophyllaceae, Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, etc. in the pollen spectra substantiates their actual composition in the herbaceous complex. The frequent encounter of Cerealia along with other <b>culture</b> <b>pollen</b> taxa viz., Cheno/Am, Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, etc. depicts the proximity o...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted in order to select male genotypes of pistachio with good performance. The study was performed on 10 genotypes in regard to their flowering time, pollen quantity and quality. The results indicated that flowering times of P 1, P 2 genotypes were simultaneous with Kallehghochi; P 3, P 4, P 5 genotypes with Ahmad Aghaii; P 6 and P 7 genotypes with Ohadi and P 8, P 9, P 10 genotypes with Akbari. Inflorescence weight showed big differences between them, ranging from 4. 5 gr for P 6 to 1. 66 gr for P 8. The amount of pollen per inflorescence also showed big difference, ranging from 71 mg for P 2 and 267 mg for P 5. In {{order to determine the}} percentage of pollen germination, a medium consisting of sucrose, agar and boric acid was used. The percentage of pollen germination also showed big difference, ranging from 30 %for P 3 and P 4 and 85 % for P 10. Stored pollen at 4 °C temperature showed 30 % germination after one month and 0 % germination after three months. The results also indicated that the percentage of <b>pollen</b> germination in <b>culture</b> medium without boric acid was lower, compared with other treatments. The viability of pollens collected from cutting inflorescences kept in water bottle was higher than that obtained from dried inflorescences maintained in room condition...|$|R
40|$|Possibilities of {{bee forage}} {{identification}} and mapping based on multispectral images Landsat 8 {{have been shown}} in the research. The satellite images {{can be used to}} determine areas of crops that are resource for nectar and pollen such as sunflower, buckwheat and corn. Identifying bee forages was based on methods of supervised classification such as minimum distance to means, the linear discriminant analysis, the maximum likelihood, the parallelepiped and the k-nearest neighbors. The accuracy of classification methods of remote sensing data for identification of <b>pollen</b> and nectars <b>cultures</b> was compared. The method of maximum likelihood showed the best results for buckwheat and good one for corn and sunflower fields by 13 / 07 / 2016. Also this method showed good result for corn and sunflower fields, and poor result for identification of buckwheat fields by 29 / 07 / 2016. The stage of flowering plants is the most important period of cropgrowth phase for beekeeping because it is the periodof formation of pollen and nectar. Therefore identification of bee forage has been analyzed vegetation period from germination to flowering. Images of Landsat 8 (sensor OLI) by 26 / 05 / 2016, 27 / 06 / 2016, 13 / 07 / 2016 and 29 / 07 / 2016 have been used in the research. The optimum period of remote sensing data for identification agricultural crops of bee forage has been determined. Buckwheat fields can be identified more effective in mid-July. Corn fields can be determined at the end of July. Sunflowers can be identified well as before flowering as during flowering...|$|R
40|$|Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) {{is one of}} the {{important}} species of Hibiscus for human needs. It is annual upright plant that produces high biomass, has good adaptability to its environment and inexpensive to be grown. Kenaf has been cultivated in many countries since long time ago mainly for fibers. In Malaysia, however, this plant is considered new and cultivated especially in the eastern parts of Peninsular to replace tobacco plantations that have been no longer supported by the government. This plant has potential to be bred to improve the quality and the adaptability. One of the potential breeding methods to improve the plant is by the production of hybrid varieties. These varieties are superior over the inbred varieties because of the heterosis effect (hybrid vigor) ofF 1 heterozygous. Hybrid varieties can be produced by reciprocal combinations of crosses among homozygous lines. Homozygous lines conventionally can bachieved by repeated selfing till seven or more generations that need a lot of times. The production of haploid plants in vitro followed by chromosome doubling is a ‘short-cut’ method to produce homozygous lines in relatively short time compared to conventional methods. The objective {{of this study is to}} produce haploid lines through <b>pollen</b> and anther <b>cultures</b> in vitro. The population of haploid plantlets from this research will be induced for diploidization to produce homozygous-heterogeneous population as a basis for the production of hybrid varieties. Preliminary result showed that callus can easily be induced from the anthers compared those from the pollen grains...|$|R
40|$|Brassica napus microspores can be {{diverted}} from pollen development toward haploid embryo formation in culture by subjecting {{them to a}} heat stress treatment. This switch in developmental pathways {{has been shown to}} be accompanied by the induction of high levels of napin seed storage protein gene expression (DeMoor, 1992). Specific members of the napin multigene family that were expressed at this time were cloned from a cDNA library prepared from microspores that had been induced to undergo embryogenesis. The majority of napin clones represented three members (BnmNAP 2, BnmNAP 3 and BnmNAP 4) that, along with a previously isolated napin genomic clone (BngNAP 1), are members of the highly conserved BnmNAP subfamily of napin genes. DNA gel blot analysis, using a subfamily-specific probe, suggested that this subfamily may consist of up to 5 members. RNA gel blot analysis, also using the subfamily-specific probe, indicated that the BnmNAP subfamily was also expressed during embryo development. BnmNAP mRNA was detected as early as the globular stage of development in microsporic embryos, but not until the late torpedo/early cotyledon stage of development in zygotic embryos. A BngNAP 1 promoter-β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusion was introduced into B. napus and Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) plants in order to examine the spatial and temporal pattern of expression of one member of the BnmNAP subfamily. The BngNAP 1 -GUS construct was shown to be highly expressed in microspores that had been induced to undergo embryogenesis, but was not expressed in microspores continuing <b>pollen</b> development in <b>culture.</b> Furthermore, BngNAP 1 -directed GUS activity appeared to be predominantly localized in those microspores that have been shown to have the greatest potential to form embryos in culture. Fluorogenic and histochemical analysis of developing microsporic and zygotic embryos of B. napus indicated that the BngNAP 1 -GUS fusion was expressed as early as the globular stage of development. GUS activity was first detected in the micropylar region of the future embryonic axis and continued to spread upward during subsequent stages of development. In tobacco, GUS activity was first detected in the endosperm of seeds containing globular stage embryos. GUS activity did not begin to accumulate in tobacco embryos until the early heart stage of development, where it appeared as a band in the middle of the embryo, just under the lobes of the emerging cotyledons. This activity continued to spread outward in both directions as development proceeded. Thus the timing, but not the spatial localization, of BngNAP 1 -directed GUS expression was maintained in transgenic tobacco...|$|R
40|$|The Gulf of Gdansk {{is located}} in the {{southern}} part of the Baltic Sea. The shores of the Gulf are dominated by the sandy barriers which have developed in front of the Vistula Lagoon and the Vistula Delta Plain to the south-east and south and in front of the Puck Lagoon in the north-west such as the Hel Peninsula. Cliffs occur on the western coast of the Gulf. Neolithic settlements around the coast of the Gulf of Gdansk are mainly located at the foot of the upland slope and on the Vistula Spit and the Vistula Delta and are closely related to the rise and displacement of the shoreline during the Late Holocene.

This is the Rzucewo <b>Culture.</b> <b>Pollen</b> analyses indicate increasing human activity at the beginning of the Subboreal Period.

The altitude of peat and marine mollusks shells and their radiocarbon age shows that during the Early Subboreal Period the water level rose from ca. 2. 8 m to 1. 1 m below the present-day sea level. The date of the beginning of the seal hunters settlement correlates well with the period when the shores of the Puck Lagoon approached their recent position. The development of the Neolithic settlement on the Puck Bay coast as well as those on the Vistula Delta, where the main activity was related to amber processing, seal hunting and fishing, clearly shows a close relationship to the sea-level rise. The occurrence of the third and fourth settlement phases was related to the high sea-level stands in the Subboreal and Subatlantic Periods (post-Littorina, Late Holocene regressions) but their character was still strongly related to the coastal environments. The settlement was connected with the dry habitats whose areas increased after the development of the barriers.

As praias do Golfo são dominadas por barreiras de areia formadas em frente à Lagoa do Vistula e à planície deltaica do Vistula pelo lado sudeste-sul, e em frente a Lagoa de Puck a noroeste, tal como acontece na Peninsula de Hel. Paredões costeiros ocorrem, por sua vez, na costa oeste do Golfo. Assentamentos neolíticos ao redor da costa do Golfo de Gdansk estão localizados principalmente no sopé do talude e no Delta do Vistula, sendo estritamente relacionados com a elevação do nível do mar e as decorrentes variações da linha de costa ao longo do Holoceno Tardio. Análises do polen do sedimento obtido nos corers do Delta do Vistula, Lagoa do Vistula e Lagoa Puck permitiram distinguir 4 fases antropogênicas para a área do Golfo de Gdansk. Foi visto que os primeiros indicadores da economia baseada em criação de animais domésticos nas vizinhanças do Golfo apareceram no Período Atlântico. Foram encontrados grãos de polen das plantas relacionadas com esse tipo de atividade humana familia Amaranthaceae (Chenopodiacea), "motherwort" (Artemisia), "sorrel" (Rumex) aparecendo também os primeiros grãos de polen de Plantago lanceolata. O assentamento neolítico da cultura Rzucewo, situado na costa oeste da Lagoa de Puck, é um dos que tem sido melhor investigados. As análises de polen indicam um incremento da atividade humana no início do Período Sub-boreal. Os traços preservados da fauna mostram que a caça da foca e a economia pesqueira eram as atividades preferidas. A datação radiocarbônica dos artefatos arqueológicos indicam que o começo do assentamento deve ter ocorrido há c. a. de 2400 AC (KROL, 1997). A altura das turfas e das conchas de moluscos marinhos, além de suas idades determinadas por radiocarbono, mostram que durante o Periodo Sub-boreal Inferior o nível da água aumentou entre 1, 0 e 2, 5 m em relação ao nível atual. A data do inicio do assentamento dos caçadores de foca correlaciona-se bem com o período em que as praias da Lagoa de Puck se aproximaram de sua condição quase atual. O desenvolvimento do assentamento Neolítico nas costas da Baía de Puck, assim como no Delta do Vistula, onde a caça às focas e pesca ocorreram embora a atividade principal fosse relacionada ao processamento do âmbar, mostram uma clara relação com o aumento do nível do mar. Esses assentamentos podem ser relacionados não só com a migração humana, efetuada no sentidodo do interior para a praia, mas muito provavelmente foi o resultado de uma retração causada pelas mudanças da linha de costa. A ocorrência das terceira e quarta fases do assentamento, durante o período Subatlântico foram relacionadas ao baixo posicionamento do nível do mar. Na área do delta do Vistula as condições de assentamento dependeram principalmente dos estágios de desenvolvimento do Delta. Entretanto, nas praias da Baía de Puck a intensidade do assentamento esteve relacionada às mudanças do nível das águas...|$|R
