40|$|Agitated, nitrogen-limited {{cultures}} of Phlebia tremellosa caused substantial {{changes in the}} distribution of 14 C-labelled synthetic lignin (dehydrogenative <b>polymerizate</b> [DHP]) between water-soluble, dioxane-soluble, alkali-soluble, and insoluble fractions before much lignin carbon was metabolized to CO 2. First, the insoluble form increased {{at the expense of the}} dioxane-soluble form. Later, the amounts of alkali-soluble and water-soluble 14 C increased, and release of 14 CO 2 began. The molecular weight distribution of the dioxane-soluble lignin remained constant during degradation, but that of the water-soluble fraction changed to higher molecular weights. Culture agitation accelerated the attachment of suspended DHP to the mycelia and stimulated production of water-soluble 14 C and 14 CO 2. The nonionic detergent Tween 80 also hastened release of 14 CO 2 and increased the early conversion of dioxane-soluble DHP to the alkali-soluble and insoluble forms. Oxidative polymerization is suggested as the first step in degradation of DHP by P. tremellosa...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} to {{facilitate}} rapid screening of lignin-degrading microorganisms was developed. Fungal strains are cultivated in tissue culture plates containing 14 C-ring-labeled dehydrogenation <b>polymerizate</b> (DHP) (synthetic lignin). Evolved 14 CO 2 is trapped in barium-saturated filter paper and is detected by exposing {{the paper to}} X-ray film. Analysis of the autoradiograms, carried out by density measurement with an image analysis program, allows for a semiquantitative estimation {{of the amount of}} 14 CO 2 evolved. The method is especially useful for screening for new, powerful lignin-degrading strains in both man-made and natural environments. It eliminates the need for special equipment for their cultivation and trapping of 14 CO 2 as well as laborious sample analysis. The method has in this study been used to test three novel fungal isolates and a laccaseless mutant of the basidiomycete Pycnoporus cinnabarinus. Their ligninolytic capacities were compared with those of the potent lignin degrader Ceriporiopsis subvermispora...|$|E
40|$|Production of ligninolytic enzymes {{by three}} {{strains of the}} white rot fungus Phlebia tremellosa (syn. Merulius tremellosus) was studied in {{bioreactor}} cultivation under nitrogen-limiting conditions. The Mn(II) concentration of the growth medium strongly affected the secretion patterns of lignin peroxidase and laccase. Two major lignin peroxidase isoenzymes were expressed in all strains. In addition, laccase and glyoxal oxidase were purified and characterized in one strain of P. tremellosa. In contrast, manganese peroxidase was not found in fast protein liquid chromatography profiles of extracellular proteins under either low (2. 4 µM) or elevated (24 and 120 µM) Mn(II) concentrations. However, H 2 O 2 - and Mn-dependent phenol red-oxidizing activity was detected in cultures supplemented with higher Mn(II) levels. Mineralization rates of 14 C-ring-labelled synthetic lignin (i. e., dehydrogenation <b>polymerizate)</b> by all strains under a low basal Mn(II) level {{were similar to those}} obtained for Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Phlebia radiata.

40|$|A {{successful}} bottom-up fill {{of single}} Damascene test features {{is achieved by}} using a two-component additive package consisting of bis-(sodium-sulfopropyl) -disulfide (SPS) and Imep polymers (<b>polymerizates</b> of imidazole and epichlorohydrin). In addition, a remarkable leveling effect is observed. Clearly, the Imep additive combines bottom-up fill capabilities with leveling characteristics in one single polymer component. These unique hybrid properties of the Imep are rationalized {{on the basis of}} an extended N-NDR (N-shaped negative differential resistance) being present in the linear-sweep voltammogram of the SPS/Imep additive system during Cu electrodeposition...|$|R
40|$|Abilities of isolate AF-W 1 of Fusarium solani {{to degrade}} the side chain and the ring {{structure}} of synthetic dehydrogenative <b>polymerizates,</b> aromatic acids, or lignin in sound wood were investigated under several conditions of growth substrate or basal medium and pH. Significant transformations of lignins occurred in 50 days in both unextracted and extracted sound wood substrates with 3 % malt as the growth substrate and the pH buffered initially at 4. 0 with 2, 2 -dimethylsuccinate. Degradation of lignin in such woods also occurred under unbuffered pH conditions when a basal medium of either 3 % malt or powdered cellulose in deionized water was present. Decomposition of the lignin in these woods {{did not occur}} in cultures where d-glucose was present as a growth substrate. F. solani significantly transformed, as measured as evolved 14 CO 2, both synthetic side chain (β, γ) - 14 C- and U-ring- 14 C-labeled lignins in 30 days under liquid culture conditions of only distilled deionized water and no pH adjustment. Degradation of dehydrogenative <b>polymerizates</b> by F. solani was reduced drastically when D 2 was the liquid medium. AF-W 1 also cleaved the α- 14 C from p-hydroxybenzoic acid and evolved 14 CO 2 from the substrate, [3 - 14 C]cinnamic acid. Thus, the fungus cleaved side chain carbon from substrate that originally lacked hydroxyl substitution on the aromatic nucleus. Surprisingly, small amounts of 14 C cleaved from aromatic acids by F. solani were incorporated into cell mass. Initial buffering of the culture medium to pH 4. 0 or 5. 0 with 0. 1 M 2, 2 -dimethylsuccinate significantly increased F. solani degradation of all lignins or aromatic acids. Results indicated that AF-W 1 used lignin as a sole carbon source...|$|R
40|$|Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (NIPA) -Graphene oxide (GO) {{composites}} were <b>polymerizated</b> radically {{with various}} contents of GO solution.

On the other hand, the optical energy band gap of the NIPA-GO composite was decided by using UV spectroscopy from the absorbance measurement in the range of 200 - 800 nm. The effect of graphene oxide dopant on the gap has been examined for NIPA-GO composites. In conclusion, their gelation process and optical energy band gap behavior were investigated and correlated to the GO content in the composites...|$|R
40|$|Two {{families}} of peroxidases—lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese-dependent lignin peroxidase (MnP) —are {{formed by the}} lignin-degrading white rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium and other white rot fungi. Isoenzymes of these enzyme families carry out reactions important to the biodegradation of lignin. This research investigated the regulation of LiP and MnP production by Mn(II). In liquid culture, LiP titers varied as an inverse function of and MnP titers varied as a direct function of the Mn(II) concentration. The extracellular isoenzyme profiles differed radically at low and high Mn(II) levels, whereas other fermentation parameters, including extracellular protein concentrations, the glucose consumption rate, and the accumulation of cell dry weight, did not change significantly with the Mn(II) concentration. In the absence of Mn(II), extracellular LiP isoenzymes predominated, whereas {{in the presence of}} Mn(II), MnP isoenzymes were dominant. The release of 14 CO 2 from 14 C-labeled dehydrogenative <b>polymerizate</b> lignin was likewise affected by Mn(II). The rate of 14 CO 2 release increased at low Mn(II) and decreased at high Mn(II) concentrations. This regulatory effect of Mn(II) occurred with five strains of P. chrysosporium, two other species of Phanerochaete, three species of Phlebia, Lentinula edodes, and Phellinus pini...|$|E
40|$|Protoplasts of the monokaryotic strain 52 J of Trametes versicolor {{were treated}} with UV light and {{screened}} for the inability to produce a colored precipitate on guaiacol-containing agar plates. Mutants unable to oxidize guaiacol had absent or very low secretion of laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) proteins. All isolates unable to secrete MnP were also unable to bleach or delignify kraft pulp. One mutant strain, M 49, which grew normally but did not oxidize guaiacol, was tested further {{with a number of}} other substrates whose degradation has been associated with delignification by white rot fungi. Compared with the parent, 52 J, mutant M 49, secreting no MnP and low laccase, could not brighten or delignify kraft pulp, produced less ethylene from 2 -keto methiolbutyric acid, released much less (sup 14) CO(inf 2) from [(sup 14) C]DHP (a synthetic lignin-like <b>polymerizate),</b> and produced much less methanol from pulp. This mutant also displayed decreased abilities to oxidize the dyes poly B- 411, poly R- 478, and phenol red compared with the wild-type strain and was also unable to decolorize kraft bleachery effluent or mineralize its organochlorine. Addition of purified MnP in conjunction with H(inf 2) O(inf 2), MnSO(inf 4), and an Mn(III) chelator to M 49 cultures partially restored methanol production, pulp delignification, and biobleaching in some cases...|$|E
40|$|A multi-functionalized {{suppressor}} additive (IBDGE) for copper electroplating {{has been}} synthesized by co-polymerizing imidazole and 1, 4 -butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDGE). This new co-polymer contains ether, hydroxyl and imidazolium functionalities {{that are common}} functional groups in polyalkylene glycol (PAG) suppressors and state-of-the-art leveler additives such as the <b>polymerizate</b> of imidazole and epichlorohydrin (IMEP). Electrochemical studies reveal a synergistic suppression effect of these functional groups {{with respect to the}} copper electroplating. In addition, this polymer demonstrates a variety of interactions with bis-(sodium-sulfopropyl) -disulfide (SPS). Firstly, the ether part of the polymer interacts antagonistically with SPS which is typical for PAG polymers. Secondly, the IMEP-like part of the polymer interacts antagonistically or synergistically with the SPS similar to the IMEP polymer. Because of this, temporal instabilities appear in the galvanostatic copper plating in the form of oscillations in the potential/time transient measurements. An N-shaped negative differential resistance (N-NDR) is visible in polarization measurements. Overall, this new polymer acts as an efficient suppressor additive rather than as a leveler additive. Fill-experiments on Damascene test-structures demonstrate a successful superfill. The quality of the resulting copper deposit was analyzed on blanket wafers by Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) experiments. © 2014 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|Methods for the {{transformation}} of carbohydrates into tactic acid (LA), which is a versatile platform chemical, have been widely investigated. These methods typically employ harsh reaction conditions, especially when water {{is used as a}} solvent. In the present study, a one-pot route that uses <b>polymerizates</b> of imidazole and epichlorohydrin ([IMEP]Cl) as catalysts to convert glucose to LA in water was described. The highest LA yield of 63 % (mol%) was achieved with 99 % glucose conversion at 100 degrees C in 50 mM NaOH solution. Compared to previous reports, the process has lower reaction temperatures and lower concentration of alkaline. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed that the coordination between the weak Lewis acid centers of the polymer with the electronegative oxygens on the intermediates efficiently facilitated the rate determining step during the reaction. This route allows for facile catalyst recovery and recycling white providing a new strategy for carbohydrate conversion...|$|R
40|$|The {{recrystallization}} {{behavior of}} Cu films electrodeposited under oscillatory {{conditions in the}} presence of plating additives was studied by means of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and focused ion beam analysis. When combined with bis-(sodium-sulfopropyl) -disulfide (SPS), Imep levelers (<b>polymerizates</b> of imidazole and epichlorohydrin) show characteristic oscillations in the galvanostatic potential/time transient measurements. These are related to the periodic degradation and restoration of the active leveler ensemble at the interface. The leveler action relies on adduct formation between the Imep and MPS (mercaptopropane sulfonic acid) -stabilized CuI complexes that appear as intermediates of the copper deposition when SPS is present in the electrolyte. SIMS depth profiling proves that additives are incorporated into the growing film preferentially under transient conditions during the structural breakdown of the leveler ensemble and its subsequent restoration. In contrast, Cu films electrodeposited {{in the presence of}} a structurally intact Imep–CuI–MPS ensemble remain largely contamination free...|$|R
40|$|RationaleThere is an {{increasing}} interest {{in the quest for}} low molecular weight biomarkers that can be studied on extra-terrestrial objects by direct laser desorption mass spectrometry (LD-MS). Although molecular structure investigations have recently been carried out by direct LD-MS approaches, there is still a lack of suitable instruments for implementation on a spacecraft due to weight, size and power consumption demands. In this contribution we demonstrate the feasibility of LD-MS structural analysis of molecular species by a miniature laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometer (instrument name LMS) originally designed for in situ elemental and isotope analysis of solids in space research. MethodsDirect LD-MS studies with molecular resolution were carried out by means of a Laser Ablation/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LIMS) technique. Two polymer samples served as model systems: neutral polyethylene glycol (PEG) and cationic <b>polymerizates</b> of imidazole and epichlorohydrin (IMEP). Optimal conditions for molecular fragmentation could be identified for both polymers by tuning the laser energy and the instrument-sample distance. ResultsPEG and IMEP polymers show sufficient stability over a relatively wide laser energy range. Under mild LD conditions only moderate fragmentation of the polymers takes place so that valuable structural characterization based on fragment ions can be achieved. As the applied laser pulse energy rises, the abundance of fragment ions increases, reaches a plateau and subsequently drops down due to more severe fragmentation and atomization of the polymers. At this final stage, usually referred to as laser ablation, only elemental/isotope analysis can be achieved. ConclusionsOur investigations demonstrate the versatility of the LMS instrument that can be tuned to favourable laser desorption conditions that successfully meet molecule-specific requirements and deliver abundant fragment ion signals with detailed structural information. Overall, the results show promise for use in similar studies on planetary surfaces beyond Earth where no or minimal sample preparation is essentia...|$|R
40|$|Binding {{properties}} of lignin peroxidase (LiP) from the basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium against a synthetic lignin (dehydrogenated <b>polymerizate,</b> DHP) were studied with a resonant mirror biosensor. Among several ligninolytic enzymes, only LiP specifically binds to DHP. Kinetic {{analysis revealed that}} the binding was reversible, and that the dissociation equilibrium constant was 330 μM. The LiP–DHP interaction was controlled by the ionization group with a pKa of 5. 3, strongly suggesting that a specific amino acid residue {{plays a role in}} lignin binding. A one-electron transfer from DHP to oxidized intermediates LiP compounds I and II (LiPI and LiPII) was characterized by using a stopped-flow technique, showing that binding interactions of DHP with LiPI and LiPII led to saturation kinetics. The dissociation equilibrium constants for LiPI–DHP and LiPII–DHP interactions were calculated to be 350 and 250 μM, and the first-order rate constants for electron transfer from DHP to LiPI and to LiPII were calculated to be 46 and 16 s− 1, respectively. These kinetic and spectral studies strongly suggest that LiP is capable of oxidizing lignin directly at the protein surface by a long-range electron transfer process. A close look at the crystal structure suggested that LiP possesses His- 239 as a possible lignin-binding site on the surface, which is linked to Asp- 238. This Asp residue is hydrogen-bonded to the proximal His- 176. This His–Asp⋅⋅⋅proximal-His motif would be a possible electron transfer route to oxidize polymeric lignin...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Boron {{minerals}} {{are very}} useful for various industrial activities, such as glass industry and detergent industry, {{due to its}} mechanical and chemical properties. During the production of boron compounds, {{many of these are}} introduced into the environment in the form of waste. Boron is also an important micro nutrient for the plants to vegetate but if it exists in high concentrations, it could have toxic effects. The maximum boron level in drinking water for human health is given as 0. 3 mg/L in World Health Organization (WHO) standards. The toxic effects of boron should be noted especially for dry regions, thus, in recent years, increasing {{attention has been paid to}} remove the boron from waste waters. In this study, boron removal is implemented by ion exchange process using Amberlite IRA- 743 resin. Amberlite IRA- 743 resin is a boron specific resin and it belongs to the <b>polymerizate</b> sorbent group within the aminopolyol functional group. Batch studies were performed to investigate the effects of various experimental parameters, such as adsorbent dose, initial concentration and pH, on the removal of boron. It is found that, when the adsorbent dose increases removal of boron from the liquid phase increases. However, an increase in the initial concentration decreases the removal of boron. The effective pH values for removal of boron are determined between 8. 5 and 9. Equilibrium isotherms were also analyzed by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The Langmuir isotherm is obeyed better than the Freundlich isotherm. Keywords—Amberlite resin, boron removal, ion exchange, isotherm models. I...|$|E
