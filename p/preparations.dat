The hypothesis of the study of factors related to the adequacy of bowel <b>preparation</b> for colonoscopy is that certain patient factors are associated with inadequate colon <b>preparation</b> independent from <b>preparation</b> type or timing of the procedure. Patient related factors were compared to colonoscopy procedure completion, compliance with colonoscopy <b>preparation</b> instructions and quality of colon <b>preparation.</b> Quality of colon <b>preparation</b> was found to {{have a significant effect on}} procedure completion along with compliance of participants with <b>preparation</b> instruction and presence of side effects to the colonoscopy <b>preparation.</b> The only factor studied with a significant impact on compliance with colonoscopy <b>preparation</b> instructions was presence of <b>preparation</b> side effects. The only significant factors related to quality of colon <b>preparation</b> were presence of side effects and compliance with <b>preparation</b> instructions. The greatest value from this study is that it leads to additional questions for further research. The lack of significance on outcomes of general patient demographics indicates that other factors may influence patient compliance with colon <b>preparation</b> for colonoscopy and procedure completion...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated an age-related deficit in the <b>preparation</b> of finger responses.

The present study examined this issue by asking a group of younger and older adults to perform the finger-cueing task with four, relatively long, <b>preparation</b> intervals that varied randomly across trials. Reaction time results demonstrated that older adults were deficient in preparing two fingers on two hands at the two shortest <b>preparation</b> intervals, but not at the two longest ones.

40|$|ObjectivesTo compare three bowel <b>preparation</b> regimens for {{colonoscopy}} {{in terms}} of the quality of <b>preparation,</b> the side effects and patient acceptance. MethodsA total of 299 patients who underwent colonoscopy were randomized to three bowel <b>preparation</b> regimens: polyethylene glycol solution (n = 106), or a single dose (n = 92) or two doses (n = 101) of sodium phosphate solution. The colonoscopists who recorded the quality of bowel <b>preparation</b> were blind to the <b>preparation</b> regimens. The discomforts associated with bowel <b>preparation</b> and patient acceptance of the <b>preparation</b> were also recorded. ResultsTwo doses of sodium phosphate solution achieved significantly better bowel <b>preparation</b> than polyethylene solution or a single dose of sodium phosphate solution (p < 0. 05). Although two doses of sodium phosphate solution was associated with more dizziness and anal irritation, patients preferred <b>preparation</b> with sodium phosphate solution than with polyethylene glycol solution. Of the 69 patients in the sodium phosphate solution groups who had prior experience of bowel <b>preparation</b> using polyethylene glycol solution, 55 patients (80 %) stated that they preferred sodium phosphate solution. ConclusionTwo doses of sodium phosphate solution achieved better bowel <b>preparation</b> than polyethylene glycol solution and was more acceptable to patients. A single dose of sodium phosphate did not achieve similar bowel <b>preparation</b> to two doses of the solution...|$|R

5|$|The {{question}} of whether the defences would have been effective in invasion is vexed. In mid-1940, the <b>preparations</b> relied heavily upon field fortifications. The First World War made it clear that assaulting prepared defences with infantry was deadly and difficult, but similar <b>preparations</b> in Belgium had been overrun by well-equipped German Panzer divisions in the early weeks of 1940 and with so many armaments left at Dunkirk, British forces were woefully ill-equipped to take on German armour. On the other hand, while British <b>preparations</b> for defence were ad hoc, so were the German invasion plans: a fleet of 2,000 converted barges and other vessels had been hurriedly made available and their fitness was debatable; in any case, the Germans could not land troops with all their heavy equipment. Until the Germans captured a port, both armies would have been short of tanks and heavy guns.|$|E

Kitting and sequence based materials supply are two examples of when materials <b>preparation</b> is used in industry, where different part variants are collected to packages intended for one or multiple assembly objects. The use of materials <b>preparation</b> in industry is increasing along with the increasing amount of part variants in need of handling in the production system, while knowledge on how the materials <b>preparation</b> should be designed in regard to the materials <b>preparation</b> performance objectives of quality, flexibility and time efficiency, needs further research. In addition, rapid developments in information technology calls for new research in terms of how the new technology fits in the materials <b>preparation</b> process. The purpose of the thesis is to expand knowledge of how the desired performance of materials <b>preparation</b> in terms of flexibility, quality, and time efficiency influences the design of materials <b>preparation.</b> In the thesis, results are presented from literature studies, two multiple case studies and an experiment. The results presented focus on how options in the materials <b>preparation</b> design influence the materials <b>preparation</b> performance. An experiment, focusing time efficiency, together with two case studies on flexibility and quality performance, respectively forms the empirical basis of a framework for how the performance requirements influence the materials <b>preparation</b> design, in terms of the links between the studied design variables and the performance requirements. The framework also considers the materials <b>preparation</b> context and trade-offs in the materials <b>preparation</b> design in regard to the three performance requirements.

40|$|When {{responding}} to external stimuli, <b>preparation</b> reduces Reaction Time (RT). One form of <b>preparation</b> known as temporal <b>preparation</b> results from advance knowledge about when a stimulus will appear.

In {{order to determine}} which cognitive processes are speeded, the latencies of the Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP) and P 300 were examined across two levels of temporal <b>preparation.</b> In line with previous research the stimulus locked LRP, but not the response locked LRP, was speeded when temporal <b>preparation</b> was high. Using Principal Component Analysis, {{we also found that}} the P 300 latency was reduced by nearly the same extent as RT was reduced. These findings suggest that temporal <b>preparation</b> speeds stimulus evaluation processing specifically, and this explains to a large extent how temporal <b>preparation</b> reduces RT...|$|R
