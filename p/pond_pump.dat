For every small/young goldfish there should ideally be at least [...] of water. A good filter, with no heater, is recommended because these fish can get larger than 12 in. Tank recommendations range up to [...] It is possible to keep small goldfish in smaller tanks, but such an arrangement will be very difficult to maintain once the fish grows older. If there is concern about the fish not getting enough oxygen, particularly when it is warm, a water pump, such as a fountain pump, mini <b>pond</b> <b>pump</b> will pull the [...] water from the bottom, expel it, and the surface action will oxygenate the tank or pond. Contrary to popular belief, air pumps and air stones do not oxygenate directly and rely on bubbles breaking the surface to transfer oxygen to the fish's environment. Ideally the water pump should push 10x the volume of the tank or pond plus an extra 100lph or gph. Goldfish will die without sufficient dissolved oxygen in the water. A filter that can do at least 10x filtration is best, which means that for every 10 gallons or litres of water, the filter should be able to cycle 100 gallons or litres per hour. If the oxygen in the water runs out then the fish may die or become unconscious. It is advised to move the fish to a basin of water full of fresh water.|$|E

A simulated evaporative heat exchanger {{was designed and}} constructed for testing the mitigation effects of polymer coatings on mineral scale deposition rates. The heat exchanger was designed to cool hot mud at 200 °F using a cooling water supply with a calcium concentration of 1000 ppm. The system was constructed using 1. 5 -inch diameter polypropylene piping, a DIG Corporation drip irrigation system, a TotalPond 530 GPH <b>pond</b> <b>pump,</b> an Omega CSI 32 K miniature benchtop controller, Omega FWH 321 - 020 high temperature heater tape, and fifteen copper pipe samples. DuPont™ lab technicians coated ten copper pipe samples with two different fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) polymer coatings: 954 G- 300 Teflon® FEP and 532 - 1003 Teflon® FEP. Both coatings were applied to the exterior of five copper pipe samples each (standard 1. 25 -inch diameter by 1 -foot-long). Additionally, five separate foot-long lengths of 1. 25 -inch diameter copper pipe were used as is. A water solution containing 1 gram of calcium chloride (CaCl 2) per 1 liter of water was prepared to achieve a cooling water supply containing 1000 ppm calcium. This water solution was {{used in conjunction with}} the drip irrigation system and the <b>pond</b> <b>pump</b> to spray the exteriors of the coated and uncoated copper pipes.
