Germination tests were conducted at the Sardinian Germplasm Bank (BG-SAR), testing the effect of different temperatures and percentages of NaCl, on seeds belonging to five accessions from four populations of two coastal habitat types. The optimal temperature range for seed germination was 15 - 20 °C; the increase of salt caused a decrease in the final germination percentages. At 1 % of NaCl concentration, germination fell at 25 - 30 °C and at 2 % it was relatively low (below 40 %) and occurred almost only at 15 °C.

40|$|Vegetation height plays {{a crucial}} role in various {{ecological}} and environmental applications, such as biodiversity assessment and monitoring, landscape characterization, conservation planning and disaster management. Its estimation is traditionally based on in situ measurements or airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors. However, such methods are often proven insufficient in covering large area landscapes due to high demands in cost, labor and time. Considering a multispectral image from a passive satellite sensor as the only available source of information, we propose and evaluate new ways of discriminating vegetated habitat species according to their height, through calculation of texture analysis measures, based on local variance, entropy and local binary patterns. The methodology is applied in a Quickbird image of Le Cesine protected site, Italy. The proposed methods are proven particularly effective in discriminating low and mid <b>phanerophytes</b> from tall <b>phanerophytes,</b> having a height of less and more than 2 meters, respectively.

We sampled vascular plants using 35 plots (1 m 2) and butterflies using 20 transects (100 m in length) belonging to four treatment types: control scrubland, restored ex-arable, restored grassland and reference grassland. A mixed model nested ANOVA showed that reference grassland, 3 years after restoration, had the highest number of vascular plant species and the highest number of butterfly species.

Ironstone outcrops (cangas) are among the lithotypes less known and most threatened in SE Brazil, due to mining activities. Besides species composition, a key feature to promote their conservation and restoration is the knowledge of the community prevalent life-forms, pollination and seed dispersal syndromes. The analyses were done based on published floristic surveys of cangas in SE Brazil. A total of 353 species of angiosperms (70 families) were assigned to one of the two predominant physiognomies (open areas and forest islands) on ironstone outcrops. Sixteen families responded for 70 % of all species.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} woody species’ encroachment on plant diversity changes with regard to vascular plants and bryophytes in traditional olive groves of the Maremma Regional Park (Tuscany, Italy) and assessed cross-taxon correlation between these two taxa. We classified the olive groves into four land use types, representing different successional stages. To describe the evenness of species distribution within a community, we plotted rank-abundance diagrams for each taxon and each land use type. The relationship between the number and cover of vascular plants,therophytes, bryophytes, colonists and phanerophytes in each plot was examined using linear regression. The effects of land use type on vascular plant and bryophyte richness and assemblages were assessed by permutational uni- and multivariate analysis of variance. The congruence in species composition between the two taxa was evaluated using Procrustes analysis. The number of vascular plants, bryophytes and therophytes decreased linearly with increased <b>phanerophyte</b> species cover. The number of species belonging to Thero-Brachypodietea progressively decreased throughout succession. Rank-abundance diagrams and multivariate analysis showed differences between the land use types, which were statistically significant for vascular plants between the traditional olive groves and the other land use types, and for bryophytes between the traditional olive groves and woodlands. PROTEST analysis and NMDS graphs showed a correlation between vascular plant and bryophyte communities.

The study was developed in Capitão Enéas municipality, Northern Minas Gerais, Brazil, where three fragments were evaluated, being one in regeneration for 30 years, another submitted to occasional fire and the third with selective cut in small scale. The sampling was developed through the point quarter method considering all the alive <b>phanerophyte</b> individuals with circumference at breast height (CBH) > 15 cm. In the three fragments, 512 individuals, distributed in 60 species, 47 genera, and 23 families were sampled. The most representative families were Fabaceae (26), Anacardiaceae (4), Bignoniaceae (3) and Combretaceae (3). However, fourteen families were represented by only one species. Only eight species were common to all fragments - Myracrodruon urundeuva standed out with 26. 9 % of all sampled individuals - while a great number of species were exclusive of each fragment. The floristic and structural differences between the fragments are possibly related to the history and intensity of management in each area besides the topography variations and the presence or absence of limestone outcrops.

It is increasingly recognized that rehabilitation of these systems is important to retain biodiversity and important ecosystem services. Plant functional traits represent a potentially useful but underutilized tool in the restoration or rehabilitation of ecosystems such as riparian systems. This study uses a functional trait approach to provide insight into the changes in ecosystem function that have occurred with the loss of native plant species and their replacement by exotics. We examined the plant functional traits associated with extinct native, extant native and extant exotic species in the riparian margin of the Hunter River, New South Wales, Australia. Comparisons of 11 traits were conducted using univariate (analysis of variance and χ 2) and multivariate (principal component analysis and analysis of similarity) methods. Both extant native and extant exotic species had traits associated with a short lived, ruderal strategy: high specific leaf area (SLA), soft leaves, herbaceous growth forms and therophyte life form. In contrast, extinct native species had traits such as low SLA, tough leaves, tree and shrub growth form and <b>phanerophyte</b> life form. This shift in plant trait assemblages associated with the transition from a native to predominately exotic flora has important implications for ecosystem processes in this riverine system.

This study determines the mechanism through which flower litters efficiently increase the available soil nutrient pool. Field experiments were conducted to collect plant litters and calculate biomass production in an alpine meadow of the eastern Tibetan Plateau. C, N, P, lignin, cellulose content, and their relevant ratios of litters were analyzed to identify their decomposition features. A pot experiment was performed {{to determine the effects}} of litter addition on the soil nutrition pool by comparing the treated and control samples. The litter-bag method was used to verify decomposition rates. The flower litters of <b>phanerophyte</b> plants were comparable with non-flower litters. Biomass partitioning of other herbaceous species accounted for 10 – 40  % of the aboveground biomass. Flower litter possessed significantly higher N and P levels but less C ∕ N, N ∕ P, lignin ∕ N, and lignin and cellulose concentrations than leaf litter. The litter-bag experiment confirmed that the flower litters of Rhododendron przewalskii and Meconopsis integrifolia decompose approximately 3 times faster than mixed litters within 50 days. Pot experiment findings indicated that flower litter addition significantly increased the available nutrient pool and soil microbial productivity. The time of litter fall significantly influenced soil available N and P, and soil microbial biomass. Flower litters fed the soil nutrition pool and influenced nutrition cycling in alpine ecosystems more efficiently because of their non-ignorable production, faster decomposition rate, and higher nutrient contents compared with non-flower litters. The underlying mechanism can enrich nutrients, which return to the soil, and non-structural carbohydrates, which feed and enhance the transitions of soil microorganisms...|$|E

The aim is to propose standardized and repeatable methods to characterize ecosystem landscape structure in a harmonized way at varying spatial scales and thematic resolutions (habitat in situ versus land cover satellite based observations). Habitat landscape pattern was assessed in terms of configuration, interface mosaic context and structural/functional connectivity {{on the basis of}} three available conceptual models (morphological analysis, landscape composition moving window, network graph theory) that were customized, automated and partly combined. Input data were from the EBONE General Habitat Categories maps available over sixty 1 km 2 in-situ samples at fine scale (400 m 2 Minimum Mapping Unit). Demonstration focused on the focal forest <b>phanerophyte</b> habitat. Forest spatial pattern, edge interfaces and connectivity related maps and indices were obtained for all samples, and then reported per European Environmental Zones.

40|$|We {{examined}} the potential {{role of the}} soil seed bank in restoration of an open eucalypt forest community following land-use change involving clearing of native eucalypt forest for grazing and subsequent abandonment, and for establishment of Pinus radiata plantation. We used plant functional traits responsive to disturbance and other traits associated with the capacity to re-colonise and form persistent seed banks {{as a means of}} assessing the effects of land-use change on soil seed banks. The soil seed bank and corresponding extant vegetation was surveyed within four replicated paired sites of fragmented native forest and abandoned farmland, and native forest and pine plantation. There was {{a significant difference in the}} composition of the soil seed bank for both land-use changes. Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling of plant attributes showed a clear separation of samples according to land-use type and between seed bank and extant vegetation. Cluster analysis of plant functional traits produced eight emergent groups. <b>Phanerophytes</b> were classified as either Ant-dispersed shrubs and herbs, Ericoid heaths or Eucalypts, perennial herbs were either Vertebrate-dispersed species, Barochorous annuals and herbs or Small-seeded hemicryptophytes and the remaining species were Wind-dispersed species or Small-seeded annuals. Small-seeded annuals dominated the soil seed banks and native <b>phanerophytes</b> with low specific leaf area, resprouting, ant-dispersal, large seed, and ericoid mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal associations formed a minor component of the soil seed bank for all land-use types. Sørensen Similarity between the vegetation and soil seed bank was low across all land-use types and was explained by the dominance of annuals in the soil seed bank and perennial species in the extant vegetation. Indicator species analysis revealed an increase in Wind-dispersed species, Barochorous species and Small-seeded annuals in the soil seed bank relative to extant vegetation. Trait associations include a therophyte life form (of predominantly introduced species) with high specific leaf area, small round seed, a seeder fire response, and arbuscular or non-mycorrhizal associations. Underlying axes in trait variation indicate seed banks were dominated by traits associated with the rapid acquisition of resources or the ability to respond rapidly to disturbance that provided for large and persistent stores of introduced ruderal species. In contrast, species excluded from the seed bank shared traits associated with the conservation of resources or ability to withstand environmental stress and were typical of native <b>phanerophytes.</b> These generalisable patterns in plant traits make it unlikely that eucalypt communities can be restored from the native soil seed bank alone...|$|R

The families Poaceae (28), Asteraceae (21), Fabaceae (20) and Lamiaceae (19) were best represented. The presence of 49 floral elements was also noted. The greatest number of plants are sub-Central European (18, 86 %), Eurasian (14, 14 %), sub-Mediterranean (8, 75 %), Central European (6, 40 %) and sub-Eurasian (6, 40 %). As for life forms, hemi-cryptophytes (49, 50 %), <b>phanerophytes</b> (19, 53 %) and geophytes (11, 11 %...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{researches}} carried out in 2003 in the river Suceava basin (the forests in the area of Patrauti), we identified phytocoenoses of the association Fraxino angustifoliae-Quercetum pedunculiflorae Chifu et al. 1998. An analysis of their structure and composition made evident the trees relatively even-aged character and various composition, all the layers (arborescent, shrubs, herbaceous) being well represented. The spectre of the bioforms is numerically outshone by hemicryptophytes but dominated by the <b>phanerophytes</b> {{when it comes to the}} biomass. Phytogeographically, the European elements are definitely prevalent. The valuev of the overground phytomass of the trees (obtained after surveys on spot) higlight the dominance of the biomass of the stems, followed by that of the branches...|$|R
40|$|The Caatinga, {{covering}} about 800. 000 km 2, is {{the predominant}} vegetation type of the semi-arid region of Brazil. The Caatinga biome comprises several phytophysiognomies and floristic compositions, with many endemic species, especially in Fabaceae, Cactaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Bignoniaceae e Combretaceae. Despite considerable advances, the Brazilian semi-arid needs more studies and inventories of biodiversity, especially the Ceará state. On {{the basis of}} these considerations, the present study aims to identify the flora and vegetation, in order to characterize the phytophysiognomy in an area of the Caatinga, in locality of Taperuaba, municipality of Sobral, Ceará, Brazil. Field work was conducted in March 2015 and 2016 respectively, in three transects. The life-forms were established in accordance of Raunkiaer´s system. The floristic list is composed of 87 species, distributed in 66 genera and 36 families. The flora comprises 22 Brazilian endemic species. The most representative family was Fabaceae with 15 species, followed by Malvaceae (7) Convolvulaceae (6), Euphorbiaceae (5) and Poaceae (5). The biological spectrum had a high proportion of therophytes (29, 9 %), chamaephytes (29, 9 %) and phanerophytes (26, 4 %). In the area were identified two phytophysiognomies: outcrops communities highlighting succulent phanerophytes (Pilosocereus chrysostele (Vaupel) Byles & G. D. Rowley subsp. cearensis P. J. Braun & Esteves and P. gounellei (F. A. C. Weber) Byles & Rowley), chamaephytes (Encholirium spectabile Mart. ex Schult. & Schult. f. and Lepidaploa chalybaea (Mart. ex DC.) H. Rob.) and therophytes (Mitracarpus baturitensis Sucre), mixed with communities including small trees and shrubs on deeper soil, composed of Cereus jamacaru DC., a succulent <b>phanerophyte,</b> and many woody phanerophytes, such as Cordia oncocalyx Allemão, Crateva trapia L., Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth., M. tenuiflora (Willd.) Poir., Poincianella bracteosa (Tul.) L. P. Queiroz and P. pyramidalis (Tul.) L. P. Queiroz...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Hantam-Tanqua-Roggeveld subregion is {{situated}} {{in an area where}} the Fynbos, Succulent Karoo and Nama Karoo biomes meet. Life form spectra were compiled at a species richness and vegetation cover level {{in order to determine the}} affinities of the vegetation of the subregion with respect to its Succulent Karoo, Fynbos and Nama Karoo Biome status. A percentage succulence was also calculated for both species richness and cover. Comparisons of life form spectra and succulence were made across the eight vegetation associations found in the area and across three broad vegetation groups, i. e., Mountain Renosterveld, Winter Rainfall Karoo and Tanqua Karoo. Mountain Renosterveld vegetation was characterised by high chamaephyte, cryptophyte and therophyte species contributions. Compared to the other broad vegetation groups, the Mountain Renosterveld group showed <b>phanerophyte</b> contributions at the vegetation cover level to be highest, but the degree of succulence was low. Winter Rainfall Karoo vegetation was co-dominated by high levels of chamaephyte, cryptophyte and therophyte species with chamaephytes dominating the vegetation cover. Succulent contributions to species richness and cover values were higher than for Mountain Renosterveld vegetation. Tanqua Karoo vegetation was dominated by chamaephyte species or co-dominated by chamaephyte and cryptophyte species with therophyte species contributions lowest of all vegetation groups. Contributions by succulent species to richness and vegetation cover were high in the Tanqua Karoo. Life form spectra of the Mountain Renosterveld associations compared poorly to other sites in the Fynbos Biome. However, the low level of succulence in the Mountain Renosterveld associations also precludes its inclusion into the Succulent Karoo Biome. The large contribution of succulent species at a species and vegetation cover level in Winter Rainfall Karoo and Tanqua Karoo associations confirms that these two groups belong to the Succulent Karoo Biome. Affinities to the Nama Karoo Biome were indicated by the low level of succulence at a vegetation cover level in one of the Winter Rainfall Karoo associations (Roggeveld Karoo) ...|$|E
40|$|Abandoned mining {{areas are}} a crucial {{environmental}} problem worldwide. The Sardinian mining area (SW Sardinia, Italy) {{has been a}} major source of Pb and Zn and was actively exploited from Phoenician times until recently. In the last century, the cessation of the mining activities caused a diffuse metal contamination due to inadequate definition of pollution containment plants. Large quantities of mine wastes are still present in the area. The Iglesiente district, {{one of the most significant}} abandoned mining areas, is now included in the Sardinian Geomining Park, a UNESCO world heritage. Moreover, the environmental reclamation of the area was planned. P. lentiscus is a shrub diffused in the Mediterranean Basin, including Sardinia. This metal-tolerant <b>phanerophyte</b> is widely distributed in the Sardinian mining area, growing also in particularly degraded sites. The P. lentiscus species has been recognised a good candidate for phytostabilization of abandoned mine tailings. The scope of this work was to characterize the diversity of the root-associated bacterial communities colonizing P. lentiscus from the Sardinian mining area, a peculiar environment characterized not only by extreme heavy metal concentrations but also by semi-arid conditions. The bacterial communities associated to plant root tissues were analysed by using both cultivation and cultivation-independent techniques. Spontaneous plants and rhizosphere soils were sampled from two different sites of the Iglesiente district: the tailing dump of the Campo Pisano abandoned mine and the Sa Masa wetland which collect the drainages of the main mines in the district. In the rhizosphere soils, Zn, Pb and Cd concentrations were 9 - 19, 4 - 6, 0. 05 - 0. 1 g/Kg, respectively. Concerning metal accumulation in plant tissues, concentrations were significantly higher in roots than in the aerial tissues. Two hundred bacteria strains were isolated from surface sterilized roots and identified by 16 S rRNA sequence analysis. The isolates were further evaluated for properties that may be relevant for a beneficial plant-microbe interaction: heavy metal (Pb, Zn, and Cd) tolerance, phosphate solubilisation, 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid deaminase, indoleacetic acid, and siderophore production. The root-associated cultivable community from Campo Pisano plants is dominated by members of the Actinomycetales whereas that from Sa Masa plants is dominated by alpha and gamma Proteobacteria. Bacterial strains isolated from both sites demonstrated high level of metal tolerance and the ability to produce plant-growth promoting factors. The construction and sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries are currently in progress...|$|E
40|$|This phyto-ecological {{study is}} on halophilic and salt-resistant {{vegetation}} of Oran region. The semiarid and sometimes arid climate {{has been defined}} and confirmed from a bioclimatic point of view. The pedological approach used shows a soil with sandy to silty-sandy texture, favoring regression of the vegetation and a halophilic vegetation set up. In this study, we analyze the floristic composition of the northern region of Hammam Boughrara using multiple floristic surveys conducted at three stations along the Tafna wadi. Dominated by Mediterranean and Saharo-Sindian elements, the relatively poor flora (88 species in total) is biologically characterized by a clear dominance of therophytes (> 33 %) and chamaephytes (> 19 %) {{to the detriment of}} <b>phanerophytes...</b>|$|R
