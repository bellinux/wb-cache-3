He joined cabaret band <b>Pressed</b> <b>Meat</b> & the Smallgoods in Sydney in mid-1989 on guitar which {{included}} Kathy Wemyss (ex-Chad's Tree). Both were recruited to perform and record with The Blackeyed Susans from late 1990 to early 1991. That group had formed in Perth, Western Australia in 1989 and relocated to Sydney and collected new members.|$|E

Upon returning to Australia, Snarski moved to Sydney and, with Davis aboard, formed the next line-up of the Blackeyed Susans. Soon after Kakulas rejoined, having worked with Grant McLennan (ex-the Go-Betweens) after {{the demise of}} Martha's Vineyard, six months earlier. Kathy Wemyss (of the Jackson Code) on vocals and trumpet, and Tim Rollinson (of DIG) on guitar, were recruited whilst on hiatus from their inner city cabaret band, <b>Pressed</b> <b>Meat</b> and the Smallgoods. James Elliott on drums and James Cruickshank on organ took leave from the Cruel Sea {{to play in the}} band.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} pig breed (Large White and Landrace) in {{combination}} with muscle type (M. semimembranosus and M. longissimus dorsi) on T 45 min, T 24 h, pH 45 min, pH 24 h, colour (CIEL*a*b* values), water-holding capacity (filter paper press method: ratio of the area of <b>pressed</b> <b>meat</b> film – M and the wet area on the filter paper – T; M/T value) and moisture, protein, total fat and total ash content were investigated. Interaction effect between breed and muscle was not found (p> 0. 05) for any parameter. The T 45 min, T 24 h, pH 45 min, and M/T value were influenced by the muscle, whereas T 24 h was also influenced by the breed. The pH 45 min was higher (p< 0. 01) and water-holding capacity was better (p< 0. 001) in M. semimembranosus muscle than in M. longissimus dorsi muscle. Based on the criteria for CIEL* and M/T values, pork meat was classified into seven technological quality classes. The percentages of pale and exudative, reddish-pink and exudative, and reddish-pink and non-exudative pork were 23. 5, 26. 5, and 27. 7 %, respectively. Composition was in the characteristic range for modern lean pigs...|$|E
40|$|Consumers {{make choices}} {{about where to}} shop based on their {{preferences}} for a shopping environment and experience {{as well as the}} selection of products at a particular store. This study illustrates how retail firms and marketing analysts can utilize data mining techniques to better understand customer profiles and behavior. Among the key areas where data mining can produce new knowledge is the segmentation of customer data bases according to demographics, buying patterns, geographics, attitudes, and other variables. This paper builds profiles of grocery shoppers based on their preferences for 33 retail grocery store characteristics. The data are from a representative, nationwide sample of 900 supermarket shoppers collected in 1999. Six customer profiles are found to exist, including (1) "Time <b>Pressed</b> <b>Meat</b> Eaters", (2) "Back to Nature Shoppers", (3) "Discriminating Leisure Shoppers", (4) "No Nonsense Shoppers", (5) "The One Stop Socialites", and (6) "Middle of the Road Shoppers". Each of the customer profiles is described with respect to the underlying demographics and income. Consumer shopping segments cut across most demographic groups but are somewhat correlated with income. Hierarchical lists of preferences reveal that low price is not among the top five most important store characteristics. Experience and preferences for internet shopping shows that of the 44 % who have access to the internet, only 3 % had used it to order food.

These scraps are compressed using a special <b>press</b> where the <b>meat</b> is wrapped in sack cloth, then slowly squeezed over several weeks to remove excess liquid. They can either be prepared in a wet preparation that can be sliced and served, or in a very dry, crunchy, chip-like form often called ciccioli frolli.

5000|$|The dish is {{prepared}} from veal slices, butterfly cut, about 4 mm thin and lightly pounded flat, slightly salted, and rolled in flour, whipped eggs and bread crumbs. The bread crumbs {{must not be}} <b>pressed</b> into the <b>meat,</b> so that they stay dry and can be [...] "souffléd". Finally the Schnitzel is fried in a good proportion of lard or clarified butter at a temperature from 160 to 170 °C until it is golden yellow. The Schnitzel must swim in the fat, otherwise it will not cook evenly: the fat cools too much and intrudes into the bread crumbs, moistening them. During the frying the Schnitzel is repeatedly slightly tossed around the pan. Also during the frying, fat can be scooped from the pan with a spoon and poured onto the meat. The Schnitzel is done after it turns golden yellow or brown.|$|R

"I did {{not much}} care for the wolves, who I knew to be a cowardly race, but I had heard terrible stories of panthers, and began to fear their {{stealthy}} prowlings in the surrounding darkness. I was thirsty, and heard a brook bubbling and tinkling along at no great distance, but absolutely dared not go there, lest some panther might lie in wait, and spring upon me. By-and-by a deer whistled. I had never heard one before, and thought {{it must be a}} panther. I now felt uneasy lest he might climb the trees, crawl along the branches overhead, and plump down upon me; so I kept my eyes fixed on the branches, until my head ached. I more than once thought I saw fiery eyes glaring down from--among the leaves. At length I thought of my supper and turned to see if my half-turkey was cooked. In crowding so near the fire I had <b>pressed</b> the <b>meat</b> into the flames, and it was consumed. I had nothing to do but toast the other half, and take better care of it. On that half I made my supper, without salt or bread. I was still so possessed with the dread of panthers that I could not close my eyes all night, but lay watching the trees until daybreak, when all my fears were dispelled with the darkness; and as I saw the morning sun sparkling down through the branches of the trees, I smiled to think how I had suffered myself to be dismayed by sounds and shadows; but I was a young woodsman, and a stranger in Kentucky.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} starch level and source on growth performance, caecal fermentation, and carcass and meat quality, six diets were formulated including different percentage of barley (B) or corn (C) or equal proportions of the two cereals (BC) to obtain moderate (M) or high (H) starch levels, and fed to 96 rabbits from 35 d of age until slaughter (73 d). Within starch level, B and C diets presented similar chemical composition and nutritive value while starch digestibility was higher in B diets. The starch source did not affect growth performance and meat quality and showed weak effects on caecal fermentation, apart from {{a higher proportion of}} valerate in rabbits fed diets C (P< 0. 05). According to cereal inclusion rate, M diets were lower in starch (17. 0 vs 20. 6 % DM) and digestible energy concentration (12. 1 vs 12. 6 MJ/kg DM) and higher in fibre concentration (ADL: 4. 7 vs 3. 9 % DM) than H diets. The starch level affected growth performance: H diets stimulated weight gain (41. 7 vs 43. 5 g/d; P< 0. 05) and improved feed conversion (P< 0. 001) in comparison with M diets but did not affect health status or caecal fermentation. High-starch diets also increased dressing percentage (60. 9 vs 61. 5 %; P< 0. 05), and cooking losses and share <b>press</b> force of <b>meat...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} processing conditions for manufacturing denatured whey protein concentrate (WPC) with the ability to form self-supporting gels upon addition of water with minimal or no heating. Such product could be used as thickening and gelling agents in various food applications. In the preliminary studies, fresh whey and ultrafiltrate (UF) retentate solutions were heated and analysed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The results showed that heating 1 % protein solution of retentate (pH 7. 0) at 80 °C for 20 min formed the desired "soluble" aggregates. Those aggregates were predominantly formed at lower protein concentration compared to that at higher protein concentration. Much larger aggregates were formed when acid whey was heated under similar conditions. The same heating conditions (1 % retentate solution, pH 7. 0, 80 °C for 20 min) were used in two different pilot plant trials (Massey University and Anchor Products) to produce denatured WPC powders. The denatured WPC powders were capable of forming viscous solutions or gels at ~ 10 % protein concentration upon re-hydration and addition of GDL, CaCl 2 or NaCl at ambient temperatures. By contrast, the unheated WPC solutions did not gel under these conditions. The viscosity or gel strength of the denatured WPC solutions increased with protein concentration, incubation time and temperature in the presence of additives. The heat-denatured WPC powders produced in the pilot plants had desirable functional properties. The high viscosity and the ability to form a gel upon addition of GDL or salts at 5 - 40 °C would enhance their application in food systems, such as in comminuted <b>meat,</b> <b>pressed</b> ham/bacon, mayonnaise and yoghurt products...|$|R
60|$|If, {{however, the}} lobes {{are made to}} close over a bit of meat or an insect, the result is different, for the glands over the whole surface of the leaf now secrete copiously. [page 296] As {{in this case the}} glands on both sides are <b>pressed</b> against the <b>meat</b> or insect, the {{secretion}} from the first is twice as great as when a bit of meat is laid on the surface of one lobe; and as the two lobes come into almost close contact, the secretion, containing dissolved animal matter, spreads by capillary attraction, causing fresh glands on both sides to begin secreting in a continually widening circle. The secretion is almost colourless, slightly mucilaginous, and, judging by {{the manner in which it}} coloured litmus paper, more strongly acid than that of Drosera. It is so copious that on one occasion, when a leaf was cut open, on which a small cube of albumen had been placed 45 hrs. before, drops rolled off the leaf. On another occasion, in which a leaf with an enclosed bit of roast meat spontaneously opened after eight days, there was so much secretion in the furrow over the midrib that it trickled down. A large crushed fly (Tipula) was placed on a leaf from which a small portion at the base of one lobe had previously been cut away, so that an opening was left; and through this, the secretion continued to run down the footstalk during nine days,--that is, for as long a time as it was observed. By forcing up one of the lobes, I was able to see some distance between them, and all the glands within sight were secreting freely.|$|R
