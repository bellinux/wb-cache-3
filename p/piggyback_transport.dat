40|$|Abstract—Participatory Sensing {{enables us}} to build a large {{platform}} for wide-area sensing by utilizing cellphones as sensor nodes. One of the main problems in the participatory sensing is the high power consumption on a cellphone because of the limitation of its battery. In this paper, we propose a low power data transport protocol, which is called as <b>Piggyback</b> <b>Transport</b> Protocol (PBTP). The PBTP utilizes the user think time to upload sensor data. In the user think time, a user watches the display and thinks about what should he or she do next. The PBTP uploads sensor data in the inactivity timer period on the user think time. The inactivity timer period represents the cellphone has connection to a base station, but does not communicate to the base station. The paper evaluates the PBTP with simulation, and the result shows PBTP reduces power consumption compared to the previous work. I...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Piggyback</b> is the <b>transporting</b> of {{trailers}} or entire trucks on rail cars, {{which is}} a more fuel efficient means of shipping and saves loading, unloading and sorting labor. [...] Wagons had been carried on rail cars in the 19th century, with horses in separate cars. [...] Trailers began being carried on rail cars in the U.S. in 1956. [...] Piggyback was 1% of freight in 1958, rising to 15% in 1986.|$|R
40|$|The X protein of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) is a transcriptional activator which {{is required for}} infection and may {{play an important role}} in HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. It has been suggested that X acts as a nuclear coactivator or stimulates several signal transduction pathways by acting in the cytoplasm. One of these pathways leads to the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. A recent report indicates that X activates NF-κB by acting on two cytoplasmic inhibitors of this family of transcription factors: IκBα and the precursor/inhibitor p 105. We demonstrate here that X directly interacts with IκBα, which is able to transport it to the nucleus by a <b>piggyback</b> mechanism. This <b>transport</b> requires a region of IκBα (the second ankyrin repeat) which has been demonstrated to be involved in its nuclear import following NF-κB activation. Using deletion mutants, we showed that amino acids 249 to 253 of IκBα (located in the C-terminal part of the sixth ankyrin repeat) play a critical role in the interaction with X. This small region overlaps one of the domains of IκBα mediating the interaction with the p 50 and p 65 subunits of NF-κB and is also close to the nuclear export sequence of IκBα, therefore providing a potential explanation for the nuclear accumulation of IκBα with X. This association can also be observed upon the induction of endogenous IκBα by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) treatment of Chang cells expressing X. In accordance with this observation, band shift analysis indicates that X induces a sustained NF-κB activation following TNF-α treatment, probably by preventing the reassociation of newly synthesized nuclear IκBα with DNA-bound NF-κB complexes...|$|R
40|$|The use of “green” {{logistics}} {{technologies for}} the Russian transport {{system is designed}} to reduce {{the damage to the}} environment, it becomes a competitiveness factor, and gives the service “quality criterion”. Among many areas of “green” logistics, the authors considered the development of <b>piggyback</b> <b>transport</b> and the organization of utilization system as the most promising and priority for the Russian transport market. The advantages and key challenges in organizing piggyback in Russia are revealed. To overcome the current limitations, it is suggested to enable the conditions, that should be taken into account when calculating the tariffs for transportation and take into account the impact of the mode of transport on the ecology. The authors discuss the direct and indirect positive effects of as part of reverse logistics for the transport market of the Russian Federation. The actual task is to form the utilization market as an independent branch of activity. The article analyzes the domestic and foreign experience in addressing these issues, formulates the problems and challenges for further research...|$|E
40|$|In {{target tissue}} extracts, {{heat shock protein}} hsp 90 has been found {{associated}} to all unliganded steroid receptors. Modulation of important functions of these receptors, including prevention of DNA binding and optimization of transcriptional activity, {{has been attributed to}} hsp 90. However no unequivocal in vivo demonstration of interaction between receptors and hsp 90 has been presented. We targeted chicken hsp 90, a mainly cytoplasmic protein, with the nucleoplasmin nuclear localization signal (90 NLS). After transfection into COS- 7 cells, 90 NLS was found in the nucleus with specific immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy techniques. A human glucocorticosteroid receptor mutant devoid of NLS sequence was also expressed in COS- 7 cells and found exclusively cytoplasmic. Coexpression of 90 NLS and of the cytoplasmic human glucocorticosteroid receptor mutant led to complete nuclear localization of the receptor, indicating its <b>piggyback</b> <b>transport</b> by 90 NLS and thus physical and functional interaction between the two proteins in the absence of hormone. The same nuclear localization was obtained after cotransfection of 90 NLS and a cytoplasmic rabbit progesterone receptor mutant. Finally, coexpression of wild-type rabbit progesterone receptor (nuclear) and wildtype hsp 90 (cytoplasmic) into COS- 7 cells provoked partial relocalization of hsp 90 into the nucleus. These experiments lay the groundwork on which to study hsp 90 as a chaperone, regulating activities of steroid receptors and possibly participating in their nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling...|$|E
40|$|The main {{function}} of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is to facilitate and regulate the transport between the cytosol and the nucleus but NPCs are also involved in various other cellular functions, including regulation of gene expression, translational control, signal transduction and cell differentiation. The nucleocytoplasmic transport system is composed of the NPC, that forms a large aqueous channel lined with FG-repeats containing nucleoporins (FG-Nups). FG-Nups constitute a permeability barrier, which prevents {{the passage of the}} majority of all proteins. Nuclear transport receptors (NTRs, also called importins, exportins or karyopherins) specifically recognize localization signals of cargo molecules and facilitate their passage through the central channel by transiently interacting with FG-Nups. Classical methods such as affinity purification or measurement of dissociation constants are not well-suited to globally identify NTR-cargo interactions because they are of a very transient nature, the spectrum of recognized cargos is huge and their dynamic concentration range comprises orders of magnitude. The exact cargo spectrum of the majority of NTRs, their specificity and even the extent to which active nucleocytoplasmic transport contributes to protein localization thus remains uncertain. To systematically map cargo-NTR relationships in an unbiased way in situ, I used proximity labeling mass spectrometry based on the so-called BioID system. I systematically fused BirA to various NTRs and other factors involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport. I found that at least one third of the human proteome is subject to active nuclear transport. I characterized the specific cargo spectrum of several NTRs and can thus estimate their specificity or overlap with other transport pathways. I identified the responsible transport pathways of various key protein complexes and demonstrated that those and components of pathways tend to be transported by related NTRs. The identification of the exact biotinylation sites provided evidence for the relevant interaction surfaces and sheds light in direct versus <b>piggyback</b> <b>transport</b> mechanisms. To understand the compositional changes, potentially affecting the nucleocytoplasmic transport, within the NPC and NTR system better, I investigated them during development and within different cell types in Drosophila and Zebrafish. For the NPC only Nups, exposed to the environment, showed significant changes. The abundance changes of the NTRs were more dynamic and indicated a more flexible adaptation to changing circumstances...|$|E
