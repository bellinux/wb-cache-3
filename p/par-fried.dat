40|$|An {{experimental}} design {{was used to}} study the effect of pre-drying (to 10, 15 and 20 % weight loss) and <b>par-frying</b> conditions (160, 170 and 180 °C) on the crispness of French fries. <b>Par-frying</b> time was adjusted with a software program to obtain equal moisture content and internal texture for all samples.

40|$|Background: The french-fry {{manufacturing}} process via frozen partially-prepared fries involves {{a series of}} heat treatments in which the structural properties of a potato (starch structure, ion content, water content, cell wall architecture, and middle lamella) are substantially altered to produce a french fry with a crispy crust and a mealy core. In addition to the traditional processing steps (washing and sorting, peeling, cutting, blanching, dipping, pre-drying, <b>par-frying</b> and freezing), short pulses of high voltage (pulsed electric field, PEF) are now often applied to potatoes before they are cut into french-fry strips. The final texture {{is the result of}} not only the effects of heat and PEF treatments on the structural properties of the potato tuber, but also the effects of interactions between these treatments...|$|R
40|$|Fried {{products}} such as chips and French fries are very popular for their appealing golden colour, crispy texture and distinct flavour. However, the significant amount of oil absorbed during frying negatively affects the nutritional value of food. In addition, oil degradation due to repeated use during frying poses a negative health impact. The general aim of this thesis {{is to reduce the}} adverse health impact of fried snacks, such as potato chips and French fries. Chapter three studies the effect of high pressure as pre- treatment before frying. High pressure was found to reduce frying time but the oil content was increased marginally. The process conditions were inadequate to cause starch gelatinization which was evident in microscope images. Chapter four investigates the nutritional stability of a blend of palm olein and canola oil. A blend that contains considerable amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols and tocotrienols, all components being desirable attributes of oil. The concentrations of those compounds were satisfactorily retained after repeated use of oil and the oil extracted from the fried chips was found to contain the same concentrations of fatty acids as frying oil. Chapter five examines the provenance of oil in French fries that is commonly prepared in two steps: <b>par-frying</b> and finish-frying. It was found that <b>par-frying</b> oil is expelled during finish-frying, and this occurs during the early stages of frying. Hence, the dominant oil is the finish frying oil. Chapter six demonstrates an attempt to replace frying oils with molten glucose to produce a fat-free product, so called glucose fries. In glucose fries, similarly to French fries, a crust was formed and the colour and texture development was comparable. The caramleizaion of glucose at high temperatures and the increased content of glucose in the product are some limitations in the process. The thesis has demonstrated the possibilities to reduce the negative health outcomes of fried products. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to obtain insight into the actual effectiveness of lowering reducing sugars concentration in <b>par-fried</b> potato strips on the concentration and variation of acrylamide in French fries prepared in real-life situations in food service establishments. Acrylamide, frying time, frying temperature, and reducing sugars were measured and characteristics of fryers were recorded. Data showed that the use of <b>par-fried</b> potato strips with lower concentrations of reducing sugars than the commonly used potato strips was an effective measure to reduce acrylamide concentrations in French fries prepared under standardised frying conditions. However, there was still large variation in the acrylamide concentrations in French fries, although the variation in reducing sugars concentrations in low and normal types of <b>par-fried</b> potato strips was very small and the frying conditions were similar. Factors that could affect the temperature–time profile of frying oil were discussed, such as setting a lower frying temperature at the end than at the start of frying, product/oil ratio and thawing practice. These need to be controlled in daily practice to reduce variation in acrylamide...|$|E
40|$|Frozen <b>par-fried</b> French fries are finish-fried {{either by}} using {{the same type of}} oil used for par frying, or a {{different}} type. The nutritive quality of the final oil contained in the product depends on the relative amounts and the fatty acid (FA) composition of the oils used for par frying and finish frying. With the aim of understanding the provenance of the oil in the final product, <b>par-fried</b> French fries—either purchased ready or prepared in the laboratory—were finish fried in oils different from the ones used for par frying. The moisture content, oil content, and FA compositions of the <b>par-fried</b> and finish-fried products were experimentally determined, and the relative amounts of each of the oils present in the final product were calculated using the FAs as markers and undertaking a mass balance on each component FA. The results demonstrate that 89 % to 93 % of the total oil in the final product originates from the finish-frying step. The study also shows that a significant proportion of the oil absorbed during par frying is expelled from the product during finish frying. Further, the expulsion of par-frying oil was found to occur {{in the early stages of}} the finish-frying step. Experiments involving different combinations of par-frying and finish-frying oils showed that the relative proportions of the 2 oils did not depend on the individual fatty acid profiles. This study concludes that any positive health benefits of using an oil having a favorable FA profile for par frying, can potentially be lost, if the oil used for finish frying has a less favorable composition...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} residual O 2 level (0 % to 5 %) on microbial growth and volatile metabolite production on <b>par-fried</b> French fries packaged in a modified atmosphere with 60 % CO 2 (rest N 2) at 4 °C. The results obtained showed that the initial headspace (IH) O 2 level {{had an effect on}} growth of Leuconostoc mesenteroides on French fry simulation agar, whereby growth was slightly faster under 5 % O 2. In terms of quantity, ethanol, 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol, and dimethyl disulphide were the most significant volatile metabolites produced by L. mesenteroides. The production of ethanol by L. mesenteroides was highest on simulation agar packaged under low IH O 2 levels (0 % to 1 %), indicating that the fermentative metabolism was induced under these conditions. In agreement with the results observed on the simulation medium, growth of native lactic acid bacteria was faster under an IH O 2 level of 5 %. In addition, ethanol, 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol, and dimethyl disulphide were also quantitatively the most important volatile metabolites. However, in contrast, greater quantities of ethanol and dimethyl disulphide were produced on <b>par-fried</b> French fries packaged under 5 % O 2. This was attributed to the limited growth of the native flora on the <b>par-fried</b> French fries under residual O 2 levels of 0 % and 1 %. Although some significant differences (P < 0. 05) occurred between the French fries packaged in 0 %, 1 %, and 5 % residual O 2 during storage, all products were considered to be acceptable for consumption. The results of this study can be used to optimize the shelf-life of packaged chill stored potato products...|$|E
40|$|A new, energy {{efficient}} production process for French fries {{was developed and}} evaluated. Superheated steam (SHS) was used for evaporation of water instead of pre-drying with air and <b>par-frying</b> with oil. The product was frozen by vacuum cooling. Unfortunately, with this process {{it was not possible}} to reach the quality of conventional French fries. Sensory analysis indicated that the main quality defect was a tough crust with a fatty appearance. Confocal Scanning Laser Microscopy showed that this was caused by skin formation on the surface during both SHS drying and vacuum cooling. A frying step was necessary to obtain a porous crust. A satisfactory product quality was feasible after drying with SHS instead of air. Due to the concessions made for the product quality, the final energy reduction was limited. Nevertheless, this study has gained more insight into how processing affects potato tissue on micro-scale and it has shown that a porous structure is essential for good quality French frie...|$|R
40|$|Soluble {{fiber in}} diet {{provides}} many health benefits; however, {{most people in}} the U. S. have much less than the daily value of fiber. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} develop a soy protein chicken nugget with added functional fibers to meat block to increase dietary fiber intake. Soy chicken nuggets were made with an industry soy formulation (30 % of meat block weight replaced by pre-hydrated 3 : 1, wt/wt water: textured soy protein concentrate with added 10 % brine resulting in 0. 60 % salt and 0. 50 % phosphates of final product). Treated nuggets were formulated to add 3. 0 g of functional fibers (70 % isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMO) and 30 % hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)) per serving (3 nuggets, 87 g) based on the control formula. The control and treatment were evaluated for pick-up (%), <b>par-fry</b> yield (%), cook loss (%), frozen loss (%), final yield (%), color (L*, a* and b* value), shear force and fiber contents (total dietary fiber (TDF), soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and insoluble dietary fiber (IDF)). All data were analyzed by SAS 9. 3, using ANOVA and significance was determined using a P value of 0. 05) in pick-up (%), cook loss (%) and final yield (%). Also the addition of fiber to the treatment resulted in lower L* (darker color), higher b* value (more yellowness) and more tender texture (P < 0. 05). Treatment nuggets contained 2. 91 g TDF per serving, claimed as a ?Good Source? of fiber, but the results of fiber content were much lower than the supplementation level in formula by both Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) Official Methods 985. 25 and 991. 43 and AOAC Official Methods 2009. 01 and 2011. 25, due to the limitation of these methods. In conclusion, functional fibers has the potential to be incorporated in the meat block to produce a fiber-added soy chicken nuggets, but more reliable fiber methods need be developed for determining the fiber contents in meat products...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{and evaluation of}} a new production process for French fries is described. Superheated steam was used to replace pre-drying in hot air and <b>par-frying</b> in oil, and vacuum cooling was used for cooling and freezing. Finish-frying was still carried out in oil. In this way a substantial reduction of energy use and environmental costs was possible. However, problems with product quality were encountered. The main problem was skin formation, {{which resulted in a}} tough crust with a fatty appearance after finish-frying. The new process was modified, and this improved the product quality considerably. Unfortunately, the resulting energy reduction was too limited to justify the investment required for the new process. Furthermore, a new look into the quality aspects of French fries is presented using state-of-the-art equipment. A combination of sensory analysis, Texture Analyser, and Confocal Scanning Laser Microscopy was used to study crispness of French fries independent of moisture content and doneness. In this way a higher frying temperature was shown to increase crispness. Prolonged pre-drying in hot air caused blister formation, which was similar to the skin observed with superheated steam. Odour active compounds of French fries were identified using GC-MS and GC- Olfactometry. Subsequently, the release of some of these compounds was followed in real time with MS-Nose using assessors and a mouth model system. It was shown that increasing the frying time, adding salt, and also skin formation affect flavour release. Most of the identified flavour compounds originated either from the Maillard reaction or from lipid degradation. Acrylamide is formed in the Maillard reaction as well. Multiresponse modelling of acrylamide formation in a glucose- asparagine reaction system showed that acrylamide is an intermediate rather than an end product. Early lipid oxidation was studied at frying conditions by following the decrease of the antiradical power. Frying French fries was found to slow down the decrease of antiradical power, suggesting that compounds with antioxidative properties migrate from the product to the oil. In conclusion, the work described in this thesis has contributed to insights into physicochemical processes that occur in French fries on micro-scale, and how process conditions influence the product quality...|$|R

40|$|Texture of {{potatoes}} with different shapes (slices and strips) were evaluated after frying {{and in some}} cases after baking. Blanched and unblanched potato slices (Bintje variety) were fried at four oil temperatures: 160, 170, 180 and 190 C until reaching a moisture content of similar to 1. 7 %. A puncture test with three point support for the slices was applied to measure the texture of potato chips using the following parameters extracted from the force versus distance curves: maximum force of break (MFB) and deformation of break (DB). These two parameters were useful to follow the changes in texture of the fried slices with moisture content at different frying temperatures. Blanched and unblanched potato strips were partially fried at 160 C and 190 C for 60, 90 and 120 s. The <b>par-fried</b> potatoes were frozen at - 20 Cfor one day after which they were baked at 200 C for 15 min. The texture of the baked potato strips was evaluated using a bending test with two support points. From the force versus distance curves, two parameters were extracted: maximum force of deformation (MFD) and maximum deformation (MD). Significant higher MFB and lower DB values (P > 0. 1) for unblanched fried slices indicate that these are crispier than blanched chips for moisture contents lower than 4 % (6. 59 N and 0. 62 mm vs 5. 74 N and vs 0. 75 mm for unblanched and blanched chips, respectively, average values for the four frying temperatures employed). There was no effect of the frying temperature and the pretreatment (blanching or unblanching) on the texture of the frozen <b>par-fried</b> potatoes after baking when compared at the same residual moisture content, but blanched potato strips lost moisture more slowly both in frying and in baking...|$|E
40|$|Deep fat frying {{causes a}} poor {{perception}} of fried products because it generates thermooxidized substances and {{is associated with}} overweight issues leading to health concerns. Hence, rupture technologies are highly desirable to reduce oil uptake dramatically. This chapter reviews current understanding of oil uptake mechanisms in cellular materials such as french fries. In particular, the relationship between pressure and oil uptake and the critical role of potato structure are discussed. New oil uptake dynamics in potato parenchyma cells validate Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations of oil–gas percolation up to the scale of an entire french fry. Finally, breakthrough experiments present deviations from conventional descriptions of oil uptake mechanisms. It is shown that in frozen <b>par-fried</b> products, inner vaporization and inner overpressure are delayed, enabling oil penetration at {{the early stages of}} immersion frying...|$|E
40|$|Acrylamide {{is formed}} from {{reducing}} sugars and asparagine during {{the preparation of}} French fries. The commercial preparation of French fries is a multi-stage process involving the preparation of frozen, <b>par-fried</b> potato strips for distribution to catering outlets where they are finish fried. The initial blanching, treatment in glucose solution and par-frying steps are crucial since they determine the levels of precursors present {{at the beginning of}} the finish frying process. In order to minimize the quantities of acrylamide in cooked fries, it is important to understand the impact of each stage on the formation of acrylamide. Acrylamide, amino acids, sugars, moisture, fat and color were monitored at time intervals during the frying of potato strips which had been dipped in varying concentrations of glucose and fructose during a typical pretreatment. A mathematical model of the finish-frying was developed based on the fundamental chemical reaction pathways, incorporating moisture and temperature gradients in the fries. This showed the contribution of both glucose and fructose to the generation of acrylamide, and accurately predicted the acrylamide content of the final fries...|$|E

In this study, shrimp nuggets having functional properties were manufactured by incorporating commercially available ß-glucan and carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC), and were evaluated for sensory, chemical and physical properties. Texture profile analysis (TPA) of <b>par-fried</b> and full fried products showed that shrimp nuggets containing both ß-glucan and carboxy methyl cellulose (BG+CMC formulation) had significantly higher springiness, chewiness and cohesiveness than control (p< 0. 05) and lower hardness and shear force values. Addition of 1 % CMC to the batter formulation with 3 % ß-glucan in core reduced 27 % of oil absorption during frying step. Differences in sensory evaluation values between nuggets containing CMC and control were not significant at any particular factors except for the juiciness.

40|$|Frying {{is a key}} {{processing}} step {{during the}} production of French fries and important for end product quality and sensory attributes. It is governed by heat and mass transfer between the frying oil and the potato strips. Crust and color of the French fries are key quality parameters and important in consumer perception. Crust formation {{is a result of}} combined heat and mass transfer effects. Convective heat transfer from frying oil to potato strips and heat conduction within the tissue cause water evaporation. Mass transfer occurs in the form of water vapor release to the frying oil and oil absorption in the outer layers of the potato strips. Browning of French fries is related to Maillard reactions between reducing sugars and amino acids. High contents of reducing sugars are often related to an undesired dark color and bitter taste of French fries. High-intensity ultrasound transmitted to liquid media causes cavitation and microstreaming, which can influence boundary layers and cell structures and result in improved heat and mass transfer. The influence of an ultrasound treatment of potato strips during the par-frying step was investigated {{in order to determine the}} effect on the resulting changes in product quality. Improved heat transfer at the product surface due to micro-streaming in the oil and a facilitated release of vapor from the product surface was observed. A faster crust formation was found at the initial phase of frying but the crust was found to become softer at longer sonication times due to persistent mechanical ultrasound effects. French fries from ultrasound assisted par-frying had a lighter color after finish-frying in comparison to the conventionally <b>par-fried</b> samples due to an improved release of reducing sugars from the tissue. Ultrasound-assisted par-frying showed to be effective in modifying heat and mass transfer with an impact on crust formation and browning of French fries. Further work is required regarding the optimization of parameters and sonication times...|$|E
40|$|In 2002 the Swedish {{scientists}} {{announced the}} presence of acrylamide in various foods. This contaminant which is classified by the IARC as “probably carcinogenic to humans” is formed in several heated foods and known {{to be linked to}} the Maillard reaction. Fried potato products are important in the acrylamide issue because they contain the main precursors necessary for its formation and moreover they contribute on average for {{an important part of the}} dietary exposure to this process contaminant, apart from other food commodities, including cereals products, coffee, chocolate and potato snacks. In the recent years, various mitigation strategies were developed by the scientific community in order to reduce this contaminant during frying but a review of industry practices was still lacking. This study evaluated various additives or processing aids on the industrial production of French fries, based on their acrylamide mitigation potential and other quality parameters. The application of acids, salts and asparaginase was evaluated on a industrial production line throughout the 2008 potato storage season. Despite some of the compounds seemed to significantly reduce the acrylamide content of the final product during laboratory experiments, their application on industrial scale did not result in further acrylamide reductions in pre-frozen French fries. Overall results suggest that current industrial practices in the pre-frozen French fries sector such as, selection of potato varieties with low reducing sugars contents, potato storage temperature above 8 °C, blanching conditions and the acidifying effect of added sodium pyrophosphate already reduces considerably the acrylamide formation in French fries. The application of asparaginase was additionally tested in chilled French fries (not <b>par-fried).</b> Since for this product a longer period of time is allowed for enzyme-subtract contact, the enzyme treatment resulted in French fries with acrylamide levels below the LOD (12. 5 µg kg- 1) after three days of storage. These significant acrylamide reductions were obtained without affecting the shelf life of the product and sensorial properties of the French fries...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was first to {{identify}} the major technological and managerial factors and to investigate their contribution to variation in acrylamide concentrations.   The second aim {{was to investigate the}} effect of technological and managerial control measures on the concentration and variation of acrylamide in the preparation of French fries in food service establishments (FSE).   The variation ininitial concentration of reducing sugars, variable frying conditions and food handler’s inadequate control of these factors in their daily practice could lead to the large variation and high acrylamide concentrations.   The least variation in acrylamide was found in French fries prepared in chain fast-food services (CFS) compared to institutional caterers(IC) and restaurants, although the mean concentration of acrylamide among the three FSE types was not significantly different.   The variation in frying temperature contributed most to the variation in acrylamide, followed by the variation in frying time; no obvious effect of reducing sugars was found.   The lack of standardised control of frying temperature and time (due to inadequate frying equipment) and variable frying practices of food handlers seem to contribute  most to the large variation and high acrylamide concentrations in French fries prepared in restaurants.   Lowering the concentration of reducing sugars in <b>par-fried</b> potato strips can be an effective control measure to reduce acrylamide concentrations in French fries, but only if prepared under standardised frying conditions in CFS and IC.   Frying instructions were shown to support food handlers’ decisions to start frying when the oil temperature reached 175 o C, although an inconsistent effect of the instructions on the food handlers’ decisions to end frying was observed.   The mean concentration of acrylamide for the restaurants as a group was not significantly different, but data analysis for each restaurant showed that if the food handlers properly followed the instructions, the mean concentration of acrylamide was significantly lower compared to before instructions...|$|E
