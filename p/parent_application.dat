5000|$|A divisional {{application}} also claims priority {{based on the}} filing date of the <b>parent</b> <b>application,</b> but differs from a continuation application in that a {{divisional application}} claims a distinct or independent invention [...] "carved out" [...] of the <b>parent</b> <b>application.</b> A divisional application must share {{at least one of}} the inventors named in the <b>parent</b> <b>application.</b> A divisional application is often filed after the examiner issued a [...] "restriction requirement", because a patent can only claim a single invention (cf. unity of invention).|$|E
5000|$|A divisional patent {{application}} (sometimes {{referred to as a}} divisional application or simply a divisional) is a type of {{patent application}} which contains matter from a previously filed application (the so-called <b>parent</b> <b>application).</b> Whilst a divisional application is filed later than the <b>parent</b> <b>application,</b> it may retain its parent's filing date, and will generally claim the same priority.|$|E

However, if the applicant decides not to seek patent protection for the non-unitary inventions, no divisional applications need to be filed.|$|E

5000|$|On April 14, 2002, the JMRI project {{published}} a new capability in their code, over 4 years after KAM presented their client/server architecture, which allowed {{a computer to}} control the layout of a model railroad via a client/server protocol. On April 17, 2002, Katzer filed a continuation patent application, with a priority date back to 1998, with the patent office claiming those exact capabilities. On March 11, 2003 the patent office granted the patent (the [...] "'329 patent") claiming those exact capabilities. Another model train software supplier, DigiToys Systems, produced software called WinLok, including functionality purported to be prior art. This information was provided to the file history of the '329 patent, which is the parent of the pending continuation patent. Manual Patent Examining Procedures 707.05 states [...] "In all continuation and continuation-in-part <b>applications,</b> the <b>parent</b> <b>applications</b> should be reviewed for pertinent prior art." [...] Accordingly, the references cited by the two model railroad hobbyists were before the patent office in the '329 patent.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "continuation {{application}}" [...] is {{a patent}} application filed by an applicant {{who wants to}} pursue additional claims to an invention disclosed in an earlier application of the applicant (the [...] "parent" [...] application) {{that has not yet}} been issued or abandoned. The continuation uses the same specification as the pending <b>parent</b> <b>application,</b> claims the priority based on the filing date of the parent, and must name {{at least one of the}} inventors named in the <b>parent</b> <b>application.</b> This type of application is useful when a patent examiner allowed some, but rejected other claims in an application, or where an applicant may not have exhausted all useful ways of claiming different embodiments of the invention.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "continuation-in-part" [...] {{application}} ("CIP" [...] or [...] "CIP application") is one {{in which}} the applicant adds subject matter not disclosed in the parent, but repeats substantial portion of the parent's specification, and shares at least one inventor with the <b>parent</b> <b>application.</b> The CIP application is a convenient way to claim enhancements developed after the <b>parent</b> <b>application</b> was filed. It is the successor to the earlier [...] "additional improvement" [...] patents mentioned above. For a continuation-in-part application, claims to subject matter that was also disclosed in the parent are entitled to the parent’s priority date, while claims to the additional subject matter are only entitled to the filing date of the CIP application.|$|E

First, this research aims at describing positive <b>parenting</b> <b>application</b> {{in an effort to make}} children being independent. Second, this research aims at describing the relationship between positive parenting and the self-reliance of the children. This research was a quantitative research and correlation approach. The population of the research was the junior high-school students in Makassar. The Data collection was through questionnaire of scale. The data were then analyzen by using Pearson Product Moment. There are two research findings. First, the positive parenting and the children’s sel-reliance are a poor category.

50|$|In case T 307/03, which {{related to}} a pending divisional {{application}} of a granted European patent, three requests were pending. In the main request, the subject-matter of claim 1 corresponded exactly to the subject-matter of claim 3 when dependent on claim 1 of the granted European patent (that is, the patent granted on the <b>parent</b> <b>application).</b> The claim was therefore objected for double patenting and the main request was not allowed into the proceedings. The first auxiliary request was not allowed into the proceedings for essentially the same reasons. Finally, in the second auxiliary request, the subject-matter of the main claim encompassed by the subject-matter of claim 3 of the <b>parent</b> <b>application</b> as granted. This request was also not allowed into the proceedings on the ground of double patenting. The divisional application was therefore refused.|$|E

High-level Swiss officials have defended this practice citing the “special relationship” between mothers and young children as influencing its decision to uphold the lower court's denial of the left-behind <b>parent's</b> <b>application</b> for return of an abducted child to the United States. The report also observed that Swiss authorities are reluctant to actively enforce orders granting return to the United States or access to the child by the left-behind parent.
