40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of an additional Er:YAG laser conditioning step after laser cavity preparations, on the microleakage of class V composite restorations. Forty-eight bovine incisors were randomly divided into four groups: G 1 (control) cavities prepared with bur, G 2 - cavities prepared with laser (400 mJ/ 2 Hz), G 3 -cavities prepared and subsequently conditioned with Er:YAG laser (60 mJ/ 2 Hz); G 4 -idem for G 3, but the laser conditioning was carried out without water-spray. All the cavities were restored using Clearfill SE Bond (R) and Z- 250 (R) composite resin. The samples were thermal cycled for 700 cycles and then immersed in 50 % silver nitrate solution. The sectioned restorations were exposed to a <b>photoflood</b> <b>lamp</b> to reveal silver nitrate penetration. The Kruskal-Walis one-way analyses of variance test and post hoc Wilcoxon pair-wise comparison were used to compare microleakage degrees. At the gingival margin G 2 showed a lower microleakage mean than the control bur-prepared cavities (p = 0. 0003). At occlusal margins there were no statistically significant differences between the groups (p = 0. 28). It may be concluded that Er:YAG laser class V cavity preparations do not need to be followed by an additional laser conditioning step to result in levels of microleakage similar to or lower than those obtained after bur preparations.
