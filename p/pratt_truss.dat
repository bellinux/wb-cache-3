5|$|The bridge's Whipple truss {{technology}} {{was developed in}} 1847 by civil engineer Squire Whipple, who received a patent from the U.S. Patent Office the same year. Whipple {{was one of the}} first structural engineers to use scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in framed structures to design the bridge, and his groundbreaking 1847 book, A Work on Bridge Building, had a significant influence on bridge engineering. Whipple's truss bridge design incorporated double-intersection diagonals into the standard <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss,</b> thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two truss bays. Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 when he designed the first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections, which utilized pins instead of trunnions. Murphy's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of truss bridges. In 1863, Murphy designed the first pin-connected truss bridge with both wrought iron tension and compression components and cast iron joint blocks and pedestals. Murphy's truss design consisted of double-intersection counter-diagonals, and along with the eyebar and pin connections, permitted longer iron bridge spans.|$|E
25|$|A <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> is a {{specialized}} {{design of a}} trussed bridge whereby the vertical trusses are compressed and the diagonal trusses are in tension. Sloping downwards and towards {{the center of the}} bridge, Pratt trusses therefore create Y and K-shaped patterns. As the exact opposite of the Howe truss design, the <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> was co-invented and co-patented in 1844 by Thomas and Caleb Pratt.|$|E
25|$|The Wright Flyer used a <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> in its wing construction, as the {{minimization}} of {{compression member}} lengths allowed for lower aerodynamic drag.|$|E
50|$|The northeastern end has two 100 foot (30.5 metre) riveted 8 panel through <b>Pratt</b> <b>trusses</b> with {{parallel}} chords and decking. A similar single truss {{is located}} at the southwestern end of the bridge. The centre of the bridge has two 250 foot (75 metre) riveted 16 panel hogback double intersection <b>Pratt</b> <b>trusses</b> and decking on wrought iron caissons.|$|R
50|$|The 1915 bridge {{comprises}} three 45.7m spans of riveted, five-panel, through <b>Pratt</b> <b>trusses.</b> Truss bridges usually {{comprise a}} combination of vertical and diagonal members fixed between a pair of horizontal girders. <b>Pratt</b> <b>trusses</b> are characterised by diagonal members that slant down, inwards towards {{the centre of the}} span. A single railway line passes between the trusses of the Bremer River Bridge and timber decking fills the area between the rails and the structural members of the bridge.|$|R
5000|$|Chinworth Bridge is {{an example}} of a <b>Pratt</b> through <b>truss</b> bridge. Patented in 1844 Caleb and Thomas <b>Pratt,</b> the <b>truss</b> has {{vertical}} elements acting in compression and diagonal components acting in tension. A pin-connected <b>Pratt</b> through <b>truss</b> is [...] "representative of perhaps the most common type of early-20th century truss bridges." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} up as a <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> frame formed mainly from Duraluminum tubing and fittings with welded Chrome-moly tubing reinforcing highly stressed areas {{and covered in}} fabric.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} RagWing designs the RW2 and 26 feature {{airframes}} constructed entirely from wood {{and covered with}} aircraft fabric. The airframe uses a <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss.</b> The RW2 has an optional 4130 steel tube fuselage. The landing gear is of conventional configuration with bungee suspension. The wings are detachable for storage or ground transport.|$|E
25|$|Thousands of bowstring trusses {{were used}} during World War II for {{holding up the}} curved roofs of {{aircraft}} hangars and other military buildings. Many variations exist in the arrangements of the members connecting the nodes of the upper arc {{with those of the}} lower, straight sequence of members, from nearly isosceles triangles to a variant of the <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{architect}} of the Burrard Street Bridge was George Lister Thornton Sharp, the engineer John R. Grant. The bridge's two close approach spans are Warren trusses placed below deck level, while its central span is a <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> placed above deck level to allow greater clearance height for ships passing underneath. The central truss is hidden when crossing the bridge in either direction by vertical extensions of the bridge's masonry piers into imposing concrete towers, connected by overhead galleries, which are embellished with architectural and sculptural details that create a torch-like entrance of pylons. Busts of Captain George Vancouver and Sir Harry Burrard-Neale in ship prows jut from the bridge’s superstructure (a V under Vancouver’s bust, a B under Burrard’s).|$|E
25|$|The Malvern Roller Mill is {{a country}} grist mill located in Whiteside County, Illinois along Old Clover Road. The mill {{building}} sits about 300 feet (91.4 m) from the present-day roadway, Felton Road, which was rerouted in 1992. The mill is near the small northeastern Whiteside County community of Malvern, about nine miles (14km) northeast of Morrison, Illinois. The mill building sits on the south bank of Rock Creek, {{a tributary of the}} Rock River, and to its northeast is a stone faced dam. The dam stretches the 80 to 90 feet (24.4 m to 27.4 m) across the Rock Creek, it is about 5 feet (1.5 m) thick and was reinforced with concrete during the 1950s. The 1858 mill building is of studded wall construction. The rectangular shaped building is 26½ feet (8.1 m) by 38 feet (11.6 m). To the west of the mill building is a circa 1890 <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> bridge.|$|E
500|$|Except for {{crossings}} over Jersey City {{rail lines}} and the Hackensack and the Passaic, {{the main part of}} the skyway is a steel deck truss cantilever bridge, supported by concrete piers. Each of the two river crossings is a [...] combination of a [...] subdivided (K-shaped) through <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> between the supports and a [...] basic <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> structure connecting each end to the deck truss part of the skyway.

500|$|In 1991, the {{new steel}} {{stringer}} Capon Lake Bridge was constructed [...] {{to the southwest}} of the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge, after which the Whipple truss bridge was closed to vehicle traffic. Due to its rarity, age, and engineering significance, West Virginia Division of Highways District5 decided to preserve the Whipple truss bridge. During the bridge's restoration, the <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> span was removed due to significant deterioration, and the roadway deck was also removed. A wooden pedestrian walkway and observation deck were constructed across the full span of the remaining truss bridge.|$|E
500|$|The wooden {{uprights}} {{between the}} wings of the Wright glider were braced by wires in their own version of Chanute's modified <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss,</b> a bridge-building design he used for his biplane glider (initially built as a triplane). The Wrights mounted the horizontal elevator in front of the wings rather than behind, apparently believing this feature would help to avoid, or protect them, from a nosedive and crash like the one that killed Lilienthal. [...] Wilbur incorrectly believed a tail was not necessary, and their first two gliders did not have one. According to some Wright biographers, Wilbur probably did all the gliding until 1902, perhaps to exercise his authority as older brother and to protect Orville from harm as {{he did not want to}} have to explain to Bishop Wright if Orville got injured.|$|E
500|$|Because Whipple truss bridges {{were easily}} {{disassembled}} and re-erected, the remaining western {{span of the}} Whipple truss over the South Branch was dismantled in 1937 and relocated to Capon Lake in southeastern Hampshire County to convey Capon Springs Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 16) between West Virginia Route 259 and Capon Springs. According to Branson Himelwright, a Capon Springs resident {{who had been a}} construction worker involved in the re-erection of the Whipple truss span at Capon Lake, the only two ways to cross the Cacapon River to reach Capon Springs were to cross a swinging footbridge or ford the river. During the bridge's construction, a new pier and abutments were constructed to carry the Whipple truss span and a connected <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> that had been salvaged from an unknown bridge. Himelwright and Jacob [...] "Moss" [...] Rudolph, who had also participated in the bridge's construction, stated in interviews that both the site excavation and concrete work for the pier and abutments were completed by hand.|$|E
50|$|The Railroad Street Bridge is a {{historic}} <b>Pratt</b> through <b>truss</b> bridge, carrying Railroad Street across the Lamoille River in Johnson, Vermont. It was built in 1928, after the state's devastating 1927 floods, {{and is one of}} its few surviving <b>Pratt</b> through <b>truss</b> bridges. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 as Bridge 6.|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} highly intact and {{provides}} physical evidence of early 20th century railway bridge {{design and construction}} in Queensland. The Imbil Railway Bridge illustrates the evolution in the principal characteristics of steel railway bridges {{around the turn of}} the century, especially the change to the through and half-through <b>Pratt</b> <b>trusses</b> from 1908, which increased the structural strength of rail bridges.|$|R
50|$|In Westport, Route 136 {{crosses the}} river on the Saugatuck River Bridge, built in 1882, the oldest {{surviving}} moveable bridge in Connecticut. The moveable section {{consists of a}} hand-cranked swing span made of two pin-connected <b>Pratt</b> <b>trusses.</b> The bridge replaced a wooden truss structure erected in 1873. Before that, a ferry service, started in 1746, helped passengers cross the river.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> was {{patented}} in 1844 by two Boston railway engineers, Caleb Pratt {{and his son}} Thomas Willis Pratt. [...] The design uses vertical {{members for}} compression and diagonal members to respond to tension. The <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> design remained popular as bridge designers switched from wood to iron, and from iron to steel. [...] This continued popularity of the <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> is {{probably due to the}} fact that the configuration of the members means that longer diagonal members are only in tension for gravity load effects. [...] This allows these members to be used more efficiently, as slenderness effects related to buckling under compression loads [...] (which are compounded by the length of the member) will typically not control the design. [...] Therefore, for given planar truss with a fixed depth, the Pratt configuration is usually the most efficient under static, vertical loading.|$|E
2500|$|The Southern Pacific Railroad {{bridge in}} Tempe, Arizona is a 393 meter (1,291foot) long truss bridge built in 1912. [...] The {{structure}} {{is composed of}} nine <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss</b> spans of varying lengths. [...] The bridge is still in use today.|$|E
2500|$|Octave Chanute {{organized}} the International Conference on Aerial Navigation in 1893, during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. From there, {{in conjunction with}} his contacts in Europe, he joined with younger experimenters, including Augustus Herring and William Avery. In 1896 and 1897 they tested hang gliders based on designs by German aviator Otto Lilienthal. They also tested their own hang glider design. To open the steady winds, {{they came to the}} shores of Lake Michigan in the town of Miller Beach. The location is today in Marquette Park. These experiments convinced Chanute and his partners to achieve the extra lift needed without a lot of weight was to place stack several wings one above the other. The idea was originally proposed by British engineer Francis Wenham in 1866 and tested by Lilienthal in the 1890s. Chanute invented the [...] "strut-wire" [...] braced wing structure to hold the several wings together, which became the standard design in powered biplanes. The Strut wire design came from Chanutes bridge designs using the <b>Pratt</b> <b>truss.</b> The Wright brothers, based their Flyer designs on the Chanute [...] "double-decker.".|$|E
