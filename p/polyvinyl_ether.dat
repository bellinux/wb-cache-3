40|$|The phase {{transition}} observed by various methods in <b>poly(vinyl</b> methyl <b>ether)</b> /water systems at around 18 degrees C {{has been assigned}} by some investigators to the pre-melting of water and by others to a glass transition of the polymer. In this study, broadband dielectric spectroscopy and temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry were used to identify this transition in radiationally crosslinked <b>poly(vinyl</b> methyl <b>ether)</b> hydrogels, {{as well as to}} analyse sub-zero relaxation processes in such a three-phase (polymer/ice/liquid water) system. The process at 18 degrees C was related to the pre-melting of water induced by the segmental motions of the polymer; however, it was seen to be one transition due to the cooperative motions of both compounds. The atypical (two regimes) temperature dependence of the segmental motion process was observed and was related to confinement of the polymer chains between ice clusters below approximately 24 degrees C; furthermore, the main dielectric process of hexagonal ice was identified and a Maxwell-Wagner effect was observed.

40|$|Lubrication {{properties}} of refrigeration lubricants were investigated in high pressure nonconforming contacts under different conditions of temperature, rolling speed, and refrigerant concentration. The program {{was based upon}} the recognition that the lubrication regime in refrigeration compressors is generally elastohydrodynamic or hydrodynamic, {{as determined by the}} operating conditions of the compressor and the {{properties of}} the lubricant. Depending on the compressor design, elastohydrodynamic lubrication conditions exist in many rolling and sliding elements of refrigeration compressors such as roller element bearings, gears, and rotors. The formation of an elastohydrodynamic film separating rubbing surfaces is important in preventing the wear and failure of compressor elements. It is, therefore, important to predict the elastohydrodynamic (EHD) performance of lubricants under realistic tribocontact renditions. This is, however, difficult as the lubricant properties that control film formation are critically dependent upon pressure and shear, and cannot be evaluated using conventional laboratory instruments. In this study, the elastohydrodynamic behavior of refrigeration lubricants with and without the presence of refrigerants was investigated using the ultrathin film EHD interferometry technique. This technique enables very thin films, down to less than 5 nm, to be measured accurately within an EHD contact under realistic conditions of temperature, shear, and pressure. The technique was adapted to the study of lubricant refrigerant mixtures. Film thickness measurements were obtained on refrigeration lubricants as a function of speed, temperature, and refrigerant concentration. The effects of lubricant viscosity, temperature, rolling speed, and refrigerant concentration on EHD film formation were investigated. From the film thickness measurements, effective pressure-viscosity coefficients were calculated. The lubricants studied in this project included two naphthenic mineral oils (NMO), four polyolesters (POE), and two <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>ether</b> (PVE) fluids. These fluids represented viscosity grades of ISO 32 and ISO 68 and are shown in a table. Refrigerants studied included R- 22, R- 134 a, and R- 410 A.

Molecular contribution concept as well as innovative computer search procedures have been employed. Both moderately polar and strongly polar (hydrogen bonding) chemicals including acetates, alcohols, ketones, ethers, chlorinated organics, water, ammonia are evaluated and compared with experimental data. ^ Chain-of-rotators equation of state is extended to describe fluid phase equilibria in polymer solutions by introducing mixing rules into the equation. New mixing rules obtained from excess Gibbs free energy models are investigated with the view of describing polymer solution phase behaviors for systems of polar solvents plus polymers or non-polar solvents plus polymers. Vapor-liquid equilibria are calculated in natural rubber - solvent, poly(dimethylsiloxane) - solvent, polyethylene - solvent, poly(ethylene glycol) - solvent, poly(ethylene oxide) - solvent, polyisobutylene - solvent, polyisoprene - solvent, polypropylene - solvent, poly(propylene glycol) - solvent, polystyrene - solvent, poly(vinyl acetate) - solvent, and poly(vinyl chloride) - solvent. With only two parameters from the modified Wilson model, each mixture system can completely be described by the chain-of-rotators equation of state at various temperatures. Results are shown and compared with several recently developed models. ^ With the binary interaction parameter cubic (BIP 3) mixing rules, the chain-of-rotators equation of state is further applied to various binary polymer mixtures or blends to study the compatibility of polymer systems.

40|$|Sequential living {{cationic}} polymerization of octadecyl {{vinyl ether}} (ODVE) and methyl vinyl ether (MVE) {{was used for}} the preparation of amphiphilic ABA-type block copolymers. The polymerization of ODVE was initiated with the trimethyl silyl iodide/ 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethoxy propane/ZnI 2 system at 0 °C in toluene. The living bifunctional polyODVE thus obtained was used as initiator for the polymerization of MVE. Below the LCST of polyMVE (37 °C), the copolymers are amphiphiles. Above the LCST of polyMVE, the polyMVE-blocks become hydrophobic and the amphiphilic nature of the block copolymer is lost. This was demonstrated by using the block copolymers as emulsifiers for water/decane mixtures. The emulsions were stable for several hours at room temperature, while the emulsion stability decreased to about 30 seconds at 40 °C. PolyMVE-α,ω-bis-methacrylates were obtained by end-capping of living bifunctional polyMVE with 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA). Copolymerization of these bis-macromers with HEMA leads to segmented networks. The networks showed a reversible swelling/deswelling behavior in water as a function of temperature. This is caused by a change of the hydrophilicity of the polyMVE segments in the networks. Hexa(chloromethyl) melamine, combined with zinc chloride was found to be an efficient hexafunctional initiator for the living cationic polymerization of vinyl ethers.

As was predicted by the former optical microscope (OM) and small-angle light scattering (LS) measurements on blend thin films of protonated PS (PS) and PVME [Polymer, 40, 254 - 22 (2008) ], the NR results clearly showed that the tri-layer structure consisting of the surface PVME layer, the middle blend layer and the bottom PVME layer was formed in the one phase region. After the temperature jump into the two phase region, {{it was found that}} the phase separation of the middle blend layer proceeded in the depth direction during the incubation period before dewetting, suggesting that the dewetting was induced by the composition fluctuations during the incubation period. Extensive studies have been performed on polymer thin films including single component and multi component systems [1 - 4] because properties of polymer thin film...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We analyze recent {{deuterium}} NMR data on blends of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) with poly-(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), using a {{model for}} the blend dynamics based on the coupling model. This model has previously been shown to describe the relaxation properties of blends whose component dynamics are strongly composition dependent. We show herein that the unusual feature of PEO/PMMA blends, an invariance of the PEO dynamics to composition, is a natural consequence of the high frequency and temperature of the NMR experiments. To wit, when the independent relaxation time of our model approaches the characteristic time for intermolecular cooperativity (2 ps), the effect of local environment on the component dynamics becomes negligible. A similar situation pertains for <b>poly(vinyl</b> methyl <b>ether)</b> mixed with polystyrene, at temperatures sufficiently high that the segmental relaxation times become small. On the other hand, for blends of 1, 4 -polyisoprene with poly(vinylethylene), the component dynamics retain their dependence on composition, even at high temperatures. The reason for the differing behavior is brought out by an analysis using our blend model. 1...|$|R
