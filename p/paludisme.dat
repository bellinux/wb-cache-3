40|$|ABSTRACT A {{prospective}} {{study investigated the}} epidemiology of malaria in an agricultural area in eastern Sudan from November 1999 to June 2000 (1 irrigation and 1 dry season). In monthly parasite surveys, 99 / 1539 blood films from 190 individuals were positive for malaria: 95 % for Plasmodium falciparum, 3 % P. vivax and 2 % P. ovale. The slide positive rate (SPR) of malaria episodes ranged from 3. 7 % to 12. 8 % in different months of the survey, with a peak in January. There {{was no significant difference}} in SPR between irrigation and dry seasons (7. 2 % versus 5. 1 %). SPR differed significantly by age group and was highest in under 5 -year-olds. However, there {{was no significant difference in}} SPR between males and females. Transmission and intensity of malaria in this area is perennial and moderate rather than low.

40|$|Plasmodium, the {{parasite}} that causes malaria, is transmitted by a mosquito into the dermis and must reach the liver before infecting erythrocytes and causing disease. We present here a quantitative, real-time {{analysis of the}} fate of parasites transmitted in a rodent system. We show that only a proportion of {{the parasite}}s enter blood capillaries, whereas others are drained by lymphatics. Lymph sporozoites stop at the proximal lymph node, where most are degraded inside dendritic leucocytes, but some can partially differentiate into exoerythrocytic stages. This previously unrecognized step of the parasite life cycle could influence the immune response of the host, and may have implications for vaccination strategies against the preerythrocytic stages of the parasite.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give an {{estimation}} of total parasite burden of the patient and the rate of infection in a malaria's intra-host model by using control theory tools. More precisely, we use an auxiliary system called observer whose solutions tend exponentially to those of the original model. This observer uses only the available measurable data that are the values of peripheral infected erythrocytes and provides estimates of the sequestered ones that cannot be measured by clinical methods. Therefore this allows to estimate the total parasite burden within a malaria patient. Moreover the constructed observer does not use the generally unknown infection rate parameter β. We also derive a simple method to estimate this parameter β. We apply this estimation method using real data that have been collected when malaria was used as therapy for neurosyphilis by the US Public Health Service.

40|$|The {{initial phase}} of malaria {{infection}} is the pre-erythrocytic phase, which begins when parasites are injected by the mosquito into the dermis and ends when parasites are released from hepatocytes into the blood. We present here a protocol for the in vivo imaging of GFP-expressing sporozoites in the dermis of rodents, using {{the combination of}} a high-speed spinning-disk confocal microscope and a high-speed charge-coupled device (CCD) camera permitting rapid in vivo acquisitions. the steps of this protocol indicate how to infect mice through the bite of infected Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes, record the sporozoites' fate in the mouse ear and to present the data as maximum-fluorescence-intensity projections, time-lapse representations and movie clips. This protocol permits investigating the various aspects of sporozoite behavior in a quantitative manner, such as motility in the matrix, cell traversal, crossing the endothelial barrier of both blood and lymphatic vessels and intravascular gliding. Applied to genetically modified parasites and/or mice, these imaging techniques should be useful for studying the cellular and molecular bases of Plasmodium sporozoite infection in vivo.

40|$|The malaria sporozoite, the {{parasite}} stage transmitted by the mosquito, is delivered into the dermis and differentiates in the liver. Motile sporozoites can invade host cells by disrupting their plasma membrane and migrating through them (termed cell traversal), or by forming a parasite-cell junction and settling inside an intracellular vacuole (termed cell infection). Traversal of liver cells, observed for sporozoites in vivo, {{is thought to}} activate the sporozoite for infection of a final hepatocyte. Here, using Plasmodium berghei, we show that cell traversal {{is important in the}} host dermis for preventing sporozoite destruction by phagocytes and arrest by nonphagocytic cells. We also show that cell infection is a pathway that is masked, rather than activated, by cell traversal. We propose that the cell traversal activity of the sporozoite must be turned on for progression to the liver parenchyma, where it must be switched off for infection of a final hepatocyte.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the spatial and temporal variability of climate parameters is crucial to study the impact of climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases such as malaria. The use of malaria models is an alternative way of producing potential malaria historical data for Senegal {{due to the lack}} of reliable observations for malaria outbreaks over a long time period. Consequently, here we use the Liverpool Malaria Model (LMM), driven by different climatic datasets, in order to study and validate simulated malaria parameters over Senegal. The findings confirm that the risk of malaria transmission is mainly linked to climate variables such as rainfall and temperature as well as specific landscape characteristics. For the whole of Senegal, a lag of two months is generally observed between the peak of rainfall in August and the maximum number of reported malaria cases in October. The malaria transmission season usually takes place from September to November, corresponding to the second peak of temperature occurring in October. Observed malaria data from the Programme National de Lutte contre le <b>Paludisme</b> (PNLP, National Malaria control Programme in Senegal) and outputs from the meteorological data used in this study were compared. The malaria model outputs present some consistencies with observed malaria dynamics over Senegal, and further allow the exploration of simulations performed with reanalysis data sets over a longer time period. The simulated malaria risk significantly decreased during the 1970 s and 1980 s over Senegal. This result is consistent with the observed decrease of malaria vectors and malaria cases reported by field entomologists and clinicians in the literature. The main differences between model outputs and observations regard amplitude, but can be related not only to reanalysis deficiencies but also to other environmental and socio-economic factors that are not included in this mechanistic malaria model framework. The present study can be considered as a validation of the reliability of reanalysis to be used as inputs for the calculation of malaria parameters in the Sahel using dynamical malaria models...|$|E

To determine whether initial reductions in child mortality following the implementation of ITC are sustained over the longer term or whether “delayed” mortality occurs. Methods A rural population of ca 100 000 living in an area with high, seasonal Plasmodium falciparum transmission was studied in Burkina Faso. Annual censuses were conducted from 1993 to 2000 to measure child mortality. ITC to cover doors, windows, and eaves were provided to half the population in 1994 with the remainder receiving ITC in 1996. Curtains were re-treated or, if necessary, replaced annually. Findings Over six years of implementation of ITC, no evidence of the shift in child mortality from younger to older children was observed. Estimates of the reduction in child mortality associated with ITC ranged from 19 % to 24 %. Conclusions In our population there was no evidence to suggest that initial reduction in child mortality associated with the introduction of insecticide-treated materials was subsequently compromised by a shift in child mortality to older-aged children. Estimates of the impact of ITC on child mortality in this population range from 19 % to 24 %.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundSparse data on {{the safety}} of pyronaridine-artesunate after {{repeated}} treatment of malaria episodes restrict its clinical use. We therefore compared the safety of pyronaridine-artesunate after treatment of the first episode of malaria versus re-treatment in a substudy analysis. MethodsThis planned substudy analysis of the randomised, open-label West African Network for Clinical Trials of Antimalarial Drugs (WANECAM) phase 3 b/ 4 trial was done at six health facilities in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea in patients (aged ≥ 6 months and bodyweight ≥ 5 kg) with uncomplicated microscopically confirmed Plasmodium spp malaria (parasite density < 200   000 per μL blood) and fever or history of fever. The primary safety endpoint was incidence of hepatotoxicity: alanine aminotransferase of greater than five times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or Hy's criteria (alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase greater {{than three times the}} ULN and total bilirubin more than twice the ULN) after treatment of the first episode of malaria and re-treatment (≥ 28 days after first treatment) with pyronaridine-artesunate. Pyronaridine-artesunate efficacy was compared with artemether-lumefantrine with the adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) in an intention-to-treat analysis. WANECAM is registered with PACTR. org, number PACTR 201105000286876. FindingsFollowing first treatment, 13 (1 %) of 996 patients had hepatotoxicity (including one [< 1 %] possible Hy's law case) versus two (1 %) of 311 patients on re-treatment (neither a Hy's law case). No evidence was found that pyronaridine-artesunate re-treatment increased safety risk based on laboratory values, reported adverse event frequencies, or electrocardiograph findings. For all first treatment or re-treatment episodes, pyronaridine-artesunate (n= 673) day 28 crude ACPR was 92 · 7 % (95 % CI 91 · 0 – 94 · 3) versus 80 · 4 % (77 · 8 – 83 · 0) for artemether-lumefantrine (n= 671). After exclusion of patients with PCR-confirmed new infections, ACPR was similar on treatment and re-treatment and greater than 95 % at day 28 and greater than 91 % at day 42 in both treatment groups. InterpretationThe findings that pyronaridine-artesunate safety and efficacy were similar on first malaria treatment versus re-treatment of subsequent episodes lend support for the wider access to pyronaridine-artesunate as an alternative artemisinin-based combination treatment for malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTIONIf taken {{independently}} {{from each}} other, entomological variables and human socio-economic characteristics have clarified {{the risk of}} malaria infection in urban area with its uneven spatial distribution, their common explanatory share remains to investigate. Indeed, {{there is often a}} lack of simultaneous consideration of the factors responsible for the transmission of parasites. This work, result of collaboration between two teams each specialized in one of the dimension; examines interactions between the entomological profile of urban under-spaces and their socio-economical characterization. DATA AND METHODAt the aggregated scale, precise and localized data have been extrapolated in order to give a model of the number of anopheles bites by person and by night (the Entomological Inoculated Rate) in Dakar’s urban area (Machault et al., 2012). They have been compared to the 2002 census data which has enabled to construct an index of social vulnerability (Borderon, 2013). These two indicators of malaria infection exposition have been confronted by the BiLISA method (Anselin, 1995). These results are completed by the assessment of the co-localization existing between entomological profile of census districts and their social vulnerability profile. DISCUSSIONHigh co-localization between the evaluated EIR and the socio-economical profile of the inhabitant is unlighted. Likewise, at the superior scale, an average EIR can be explained for a large part (43 %) by an average social profile of nearby census districts. The spatial coherence which exists between profiles leads to several interpretations. The notion of “poverty traps” for example can be a good summary of the places of accumulation of vulnerabilities, where people with “limited capabilities” live in some areas which border high EIR (Borderon et al., 2013). Restricted to areas where landscapes are "pathogens", people may have no choice or no control of their environment. In contrast, the city dwellers with a low vulnerability reside mainly {{in the center of the}} peninsula and are farther from Anopheles bites. APPLICATIONTherefore, in the current context of pre-elimination of malaria in Senegal, these results are fundamental. If malaria in urban areas is quite low (in 2008, for example, with a minimal prevalence rate of 2 %) (Diallo et al., 2012), it is nonetheless very unevenly distributed in space where some poverty traps concentrate the meeting places between the three hosts of malaria pathogen complex. Thus, taking the logic of "target programs” of the protocol of Hyogo, it is interesting to accurately locate these areas, high circulation locations of the parasite. REFERENCESAnselin L.

Si prises indépendamment l’une de l’autre, les variables entomologiques et les caractéristiques socio‐économiques des hôtes humains ont permis d’éclaircir le risque d’infection au <b>paludisme</b> urbain et son inégale répartition dans l’espace, leur part explicative commune reste à investiguer. En effet, il y a souvent une absence de considération simultanée des facteurs responsables de la transmission des parasites. Le présent travail, fruit de la collaboration entre deux équipes spécialistes chacune d’une des deux dimensions, interroge les interactions entre le profil entomologique des sous espaces urbains et leur caractérisation socio‐économique...|$|E
