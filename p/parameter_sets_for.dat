40|$|This paper {{shows that}} nuclear radii and neutron skins do {{directly}} reflect the saturation density of asymmetric nuclear matter. The neutron distributions in a nucleus {{are dependent on}} the equation of state (EOS) of asymmetric nuclear matter while the proton distributions are remarkably independent of the EOS. Macroscopic model calculations are performed to demonstrate these features with two popular phenomenological,but distinctively different,EOS: the SIII <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> <b>for</b> the non-relativistic Skyrme Hartree-Fock theory and the TM 1 <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> <b>for</b> the relativistic mean field theory. The key EOS parameter is the saturation density of asymmetric nuclear matter.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of early outbreak signal which are weak and behaved under uncertainties {{has brought to}} the development of outbreak detection model based on dendrite cell algorithm. Although the algorithm is proven can improve detection performance, it relies on several parameters which need to be defined before mining. In this study, the most appropriate <b>parameter</b> <b>setting</b> <b>for</b> outbreak detection using dendrite cell algorithm is examined. The experiment includes four parameters; the number of cell cycle update, the number of dendrite cell allowed to be in population, weight, and migration threshold value. To achieve that, an anthrax disease outbreak is chosen as a case study. Two artificial anthrax datasets known as WSARE 7 and WSARE 58 are taken as experiment data. The experiment is measured based on five metrics; detection rate, specificity, false alarm rate, accuracy, and time taken to produce result. Besides that, a comparison is made with Cumulative Sum, Exponentially-weighted Moving Average, and Multi Layer Perceptron. From the experiment, the best <b>parameter</b> <b>setting</b> <b>for</b> anthrax outbreak using dendrite cell algorithm is identified whereby it proven can helps the model to produce a good detection result between detection rate and false alarm rate. Since each outbreak disease carries different outbreak characteristic, the <b>parameter</b> <b>setting</b> <b>for</b> different outbreak might be different...|$|R
40|$|In stereo literature, {{there is}} no {{standard}} method for evaluating algorithms for semi-dense stereo matching.

We propose evaluation of stereo algorithms based on Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) which captures both errors and sparsity. By comparing ROC curves of all tested algorithms we obtain the Feasibility Boundary, the best possible performance achieved {{by a set of}} tested stereo algorithms, which allows stereo algorithm users to select the proper method and <b>parameter</b> <b>setting</b> <b>for</b> a required application. 1...|$|R
