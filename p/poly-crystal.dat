40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} to measure the impact forces generated by cylindrical ice projectiles striking a relatively rigid target. Two types of ice projectiles were used, solid clear ice and lower density fabricated ice. Three forms of solid clear ice were tested: single crystal, <b>poly-crystal,</b> and "rejected" <b>poly-crystal</b> (<b>poly-crystal</b> ice in which defects were detected during inspection.) The solid ice had a density of approximately 56 lb/cu ft (0. 9 gm/cu cm). A second set of test specimens, termed "low density ice" was manufactured by molding shaved ice into a cylindrical die to produce ice with a density of approximately 40 lb/cu ft (0. 65 gm/cu cm). Both the static mechanical characteristics and the crystalline structure of the ice {{were found to have}} little effect on the observed transient response. The impact forces generated by low density ice projectiles, which had very low mechanical strength, were comparable to those of full density solid ice. This supports the hypothesis that at a velocity significantly greater than that required to produce fracture in the ice, the mechanical properties become relatively insignificant, and the impact forces are governed by the shape and mass of the projectile...|$|E

The out-of-plane fluctuations are significantly suppressed with increasing x, and it was revealed that the FM fluctuations become two dimensional near a FM quantum critical point (QCP). Our NMR results strongly suggest that a unique FM QCP in Ce(Ru 1 -xFex) PO is induced by the suppression of the magnetic correlations along the c-axis, which is a different mechanism from that presumed in heavy-fermion compounds.

40|$|Design {{of nuclear}} {{materials}} with high radiation-tolerance has great significance 1, {{especially for the}} next generation of nuclear energy systems 2, 3. Response of nano- and <b>poly-crystals</b> to irradiation depends on the radiation temperature, dose-rate and grain size 4 - 13. However the dependencies had been studied and interpreted individually, and thus severely lacking is the ability to predict radiation performance of materials in extreme environments. Here we propose an operational window for radiation-resistant materials, which is based on a perspective of interactions among irradiation-induced interstitials, vacancies, and grain boundaries. Using atomic simulations, we find that healing grain boundaries needs much longer time than healing grain interiors. Not been noticed before, this finding suggests priority should be thereafter given to recovery of the grain boundary itself. This large disparity in healing time is reflected in the spectra of defects-recombination energy barriers by the presence of one high-barrier peak in addition to the peak of low barriers. The insight gained from the study instigates new avenues for examining the role of grain boundaries in healing the material. In particular, we sketch out the radiation-endurance window in the parameter space of temperature, dose-rate and grain size. The window helps evaluate material performance and develop resistant materials against radiation damage. Comment: 22 p ages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceZener type {{relaxation}} in Fe-Ga based alloys with Ga {{content from}} ∼ 8 to ∼ 28 at. % {{were identified and}} studied using the Dynamical Mechanical Analyser (DMA) and a Forced Torsion Pendulum (FTP). The Zener relaxation caused by reorientation of pairs of Ga atoms in Fe {{was used to evaluate}} the activation parameters of Ga atom jumps in Fe. An increase in the relaxation strength occurred with an increase in the Ga content up to 19 at. % according to {{an increase in the number}} of Ga-Ga atom pairs (Δ∼CGa 2 (1 -CGa) 2), whereas a decrease in the relaxation strength from 19 to 28 at. % Ga was assigned to D 03 and L 12 ordering of Ga atoms in Fe-Ga alloys. Ordering and phase transitions in these alloys affected the Zener relaxation parameters and led to the appearance of transient anelastic effects. A study of several ternary Fe-Ga-Al alloys using both temperature dependent and isothermal mechanical spectroscopy (frequency variations from 10 − 4 – 102 Hz) was conducted to avoid transient effects which take place at heating or cooling, and to measure anelasticity of alloys in the equilibrium state for the chosen temperatures. The Arrhenius treatment of relaxation effects in single- and <b>poly-crystals</b> allows identifying the Zener effects in ternary alloys and to analyse them with respect to alloy structures...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} {{discovery}} of superconductivity with Tc = 5. 5 K in Nb 2 PdxSe 5, in which one-dimensional (1 D) Nb-Se chains existing along the b-direction hybridize {{each other to}} form the conducting b-c* plane. The magnetic susceptibility and specific heat data in both single- and <b>poly-crystals</b> show evidence of bulk superconductivity. The resistivity, Hall coefficient, and magneto-resistance data all indicate {{the presence of an}} energy scale T* = ~ 50 K, which becomes systematically lowered under hydrostatic pressure and competes with the stabilization of superconductivity. Combined with the band calculation results showing the Fermi surfaces with 1 D character, we postulate that the energy scale T* is related to a formation of a density wave or a stabilization of low dimensional electronic structure. The zero temperature upper critical field, Hc 2 (0), of the single crystal is found to be 10. 5, 35 and 22 T in the a', b and c*-directions, respectively. While the linearly increasing Hc 2 (T) for H // c* indicates the multi-band effect, Hc 2 (0) for H // b and c* are found to be much bigger than the BCS Pauli limiting field, 1. 84 Tc ~ 9 T. The suppressed Pauli paramagnetic effect points to a possibility of the enhanced spin-orbit scattering related to the low dimensional electronic structure or the presence of heavy elements such as Pd.
