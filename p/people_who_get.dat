25|$|People {{with higher}} levels of vitamin D tend to have lower rates of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke and tend to have lower blood pressure. However, it has been found that vitamin D supplementation does not improve {{cardiovascular}} health or metabolism, so the link with vitamin D must be in part indirect. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> more sun are generally healthier, and also have higher vitamin D levels. It has been found that ultraviolet radiation (even UVA) produces nitric oxide (NO) in the skin, and nitric oxide can lower blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the risk of stroke and heart disease. Although long-term exposure to ultraviolet contributes to non-melanoma skin cancers that are rarely fatal, it has been found in a Danish study that those who get these cancers were less likely to die during the study, and were much less likely to have a heart attack, {{than those who did not}} have these cancers.|$|E
25|$|With {{the fast}} {{development}} {{of the country and}} the massive internal migration in China, the standard Putonghua Proficiency Test has quickly become popular. Many university graduates in mainland China and Hong Kong take this exam before looking for a job. Employers often require varying proficiency in Standard Chinese from applicants depending {{on the nature of the}} positions. Applicants of some positions, e.g. telephone operators, may be required to obtain a certificate. People raised in Beijing are sometimes considered inherently 1-A (A score of at least 97%) and exempted from this requirement. As for the rest, the score of 1-A is rare. According to the official definition of proficiency levels, <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> 1-B (A score of at least 92%) are considered qualified to work as television correspondents or in broadcasting stations. 2-A (A score of at least 87%) can work as Chinese Literature Course teachers in public schools. Other levels include: 2-B (A score of at least 80%), 3-A (A score of at least 70%) and 3-B (A score of at least 60%). In China, a proficiency of level 3-B usually cannot be achieved unless special training is received. Even though many Chinese do not speak with standard pronunciation, spoken Standard Chinese is widely understood to some degree.|$|E

500|$|Schindler's List {{was very}} well {{received}} by many of Spielberg's peers. Filmmaker Billy Wilder wrote to Spielberg saying, [...] "They couldn't have gotten a better man. This movie is absolutely perfection." [...] Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, [...] "I certainly wouldn't have done {{as good a job}} as Spielberg because I couldn't have been as objective as he was." [...] He cited Schindler's List as an influence on his 1995 film Death and the Maiden. The success of Schindler's List led filmmaker Stanley Kubrick to abandon his own Holocaust project, Aryan Papers, which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic. When scriptwriter Frederic Raphael suggested that Schindler's List was a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, [...] "Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about 6 million <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> killed. Schindler's List is about 600 who don't." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Weeping Willow" [...] {{analyzes}} {{the concept of}} 15 minutes of fame during the Information Age {{from the perspective of}} the Internet celebrity, one who gains fame through the creation of or participation in a popular website. Leight said of the episode, [...] "Forget about 15 minutes of fame: there are hundreds of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> their 15 inches of bandwidth, people making names for themselves on YouTube and others. ... This blogging phenomenon has created a certain kind of 'cyberfame,' people who don't have to do anything more than put themselves on the Web and catch a cyberwave. We now have a spate of very strange celebrities." [...] Leight said the episode also focuses on the extent to which one will go to achieve such fame. While the Law & Order shows routinely draw on inspiration from real-life events in an approach the creators call [...] "ripped from the headlines", Criminal Intent producers referred to this episode as [...] "'pre-ripping' from the headlines", because the script usually took a real-life event (as the lonelygirl15 phenomenon) and added to it a fictional dramatic conflict (the kidnapping).|$|E

2500|$|Other {{social media}} users {{frequently}} quote, recontextualize, or remix dril tweets {{for their own}} satirical purposes, and some accounts are even exclusively dedicated to this purpose. One such account, @EveryoneIsDril, shares screenshots of tweets by other people that sound like dril's voice. Another, [...] "wint MP" [...] or @parliawint, attaches dril tweets styled like teletext closed captions to images from BBC News of British politicians and journalists speaking. Although seemingly niche, the wint MP account garnered 14,000 followers by May 2017. Tom Dissonance, the creator of wint MP, attributed the account's success to its functioning as a joke on multiple levels, and for multiple audiences: [...] "there are <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> the in-jokey references; there's a broader level of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> politics and dril, and understand the significance of one commenting on another; and beyond {{that there are people}} who just appreciate an official figure in a suit saying something ridiculous. It's an onion of silliness." [...] Koshy commented that wint MP [...] "stands out from traditional forms of satire because it has no normative force. It recommends nothing about the way things should be. The political field it presents is slack-jawed, demented, putrid and amoral – there is no value beyond the scope of its image."

In the first two games, the death game {{is referred to as the}} Nonary Game, while the one in the third game is called the Decision Game. The characters do not at first appear to have anything in common, but throughout the course of the games, it is revealed that each was chosen for a specific purpose, including connections to previous narrative elements from the other games in the series.

The next interim objective is to grow the EndingHunger movement's Facebook community to 1 million members. As with the petition, the more <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> involved, the more powerful the message to governments: [...] "We are no longer willing {{to accept the fact that}} hundreds of millions live in chronic hunger." [...] Groups and individuals can also decide on their own to organize an event about the project, simply by gathering friends, whistles, T-shirts and banners (whistles and T-shirts can be ordered, and petition sign sheets downloaded, on the endinghunger.org website) and thereby alert people about chronic hunger by using the yellow whistle.|$|E

2500|$|Australian ugg {{boots are}} not {{considered}} fashionable in their countries of origin and are worn for warmth and comfort. Ugg boots in Australia are worn predominantly as slippers and associated with [...] "daggy fashion sense, bogan behaviour" [...] and the [...] "outer suburbs" [...] when worn in public. According to Australian fashion stylist Justin Craig: [...] "The only <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> away with wearing them are models, who give out the message: 'I'm so beautiful, I can look good in any crap." [...] The Deckers UGG brand emerged as a fashion trend in the US through Deckers' actions to promote it as a high fashion brand. Deckers solicited endorsements from celebrities such as Kate Hudson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cameron Diaz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lopez, and product placements in television series such as Sex and the City, and films such as Raising Helen. This marketing campaign [...] "led to an exponential growth in the brand's popularity and recognizability."

2500|$|In 1998 Lionel {{was shocked}} to {{discover}} he had fathered a son, 16-year-old Luke Billingham (Greg Freeman) when he himself was 16. Luke debuted as a [...] "shy, inarticulate country boy with an adventurous spirit" [...] who shockingly revealed to Lionel that he was his son. Though Lionel was in shock, he took Luke in, Leigh stated, [...] "Lionel’s struggling {{to get through it}} as fatherhood is thrust upon him. He just inherited a 16-year-old son unlike most <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> to watch their kids from a baby and slowly get used to them." [...] The storyline proved to be hugely topical, with the amount of single parent families in the nineties was at an all-time high. Luke instantly got into trouble in his new home, he was involved in a robbery at Lionel's bar, drove Lionel's car without a driver's license and stole a credit card to access online pornography. Despite this, Leigh insisted Lionel was the best possible father, [...] "Lionel’s the best father. He talks through the troubles." [...] After initially struggling to connect with Luke, when he was involved in a dramatic bus crash Lionel realised how much he loved his son and even went to the extent of cooking him gourmet school lunches. After only knowing each other a year, the father-son partnership was broken after Lionel died in scenes that Freeman described as, [...] "draining". Luke soon became a father with his teenage bride, Josie Bergman (Karamia Muller) at age 16, similarly to his father Lionel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} criticised for {{its lack of}} {{creativity}} and personality. Hugh Montgomery of The Observer called the album [...] "a serious disappointment." [...] Although he saw an improvement from 3 Words, Montgomery felt the album did {{not live up to}} [...] "the Xenomania-directed wizardry of her Girls Aloud oeuvre." [...] Maddy Costa of The Guardian wrote further, [...] "Coming from a member {{of one of the most}} forward-looking pop acts of the 21st century, Messy Little Raindrops feels curiously dated." [...] It received two stars out of five from Andy Gill of The Independent, who wrote that [...] "Cole delve further into her experience for Messy Little Raindrops; sadly, most of the album simply continues its predecessor's tedious romantic arguments, with only a couple of songs drawing on her more traumatic illness." [...] Simon Gage of the Daily Express commented that [...] "even by her standards this second solo outing is phoned in." [...] A review from The Scotsman agreed, criticizing the album as [...] "a reasonable pop record that has had all the personality produced right out of it." [...] Simon Price, also [...] from The Independent, was overwhelmingly negative. He summarised, [...] "Messy Little Raindrops is music for yoghurt adverts, with lyrics for <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>get</b> their emotional vocabulary from Take a Break and Loose Women." [...] A negative review from NME said, [...] "Unsurprisingly, we're not mad for Chezza's manufactured conveyor-belt-drivel." [...] and commented that in [...] "time when the likes of Janelle Monáe are creating brilliant futuristic pop, it’s surely time to send Cole back to Newcastle". Entertainment.ies Jenny Mulligan describes Messy Little Raindrops as being [...] "more club-friendly" [...] and as [...] "a pop album with a few banging singles and a lot of filler".|$|E
