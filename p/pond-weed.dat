50|$|The {{common crane}} is omnivorous, as are all cranes. It largely eats plant matter, {{including}} roots, rhizomes, tubers, stems, leaves, fruits and seeds. They also commonly eat, when available, <b>pond-weeds,</b> heath berries, peas, potatoes, olives, acorns, cedarnuts and pods of peanuts. Notably amongst the berries consumed, the cranberry, is possibly {{named after the}} species.|$|R
60|$|But {{even further}} north, in Spitzbergen, in 78° and 79° N. Lat. {{and one of}} the most barren and inhospitable regions on the globe, an almost equally rich fossil flora has been {{discovered}} including several of the Greenland species, and others peculiar, but mostly of the same genera. There seem to be no evergreens here except coniferæ, one of which is identical with the swamp-cypress (Taxodium distichum) now found living in the Southern United States! There are also eleven pines, two Libocedrus, two sequoias, with oaks, poplars, birches, planes, limes, a hazel, an ash, and a walnut; also water-lilies, <b>pond-weeds,</b> and an iris--altogether about a hundred species of flowering plants. Even in Grinnell Land, within 8¼ degrees of the pole, a similar flora existed, twenty-five species of fossil plants having been collected by the last Arctic expedition, of which eighteen were identical with the species from other Arctic localities. This flora comprised poplars, birches, hazels, elms, viburnums, and eight species of conifers including the swamp cypress and the Norway spruce (Pinus abies) which last does not now extend beyond 69½° N.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{once upon}} a time, {{so long ago that}} no man can tell when, the land was so much higher, that between England and Ireland, and, what is more, between England and Norway, was firm dry land. The country then must have looked--at least we know it looked so in Norfolk--very like what our moors look like here. There were forests of Scotch fir, and of spruce too, which is not wild in England now, though you may see plenty in every plantation. There were oaks and alders, yews and sloes, just as there are in our woods now. There was buck-bean in the bogs, as there is in Larmer's and Heath pond; and white and yellow water-lilies, horn-wort, and <b>pond-weeds,</b> just as there are now in our ponds. There were wild horses, wild deer, and wild oxen, those last of an {{enormous}} size. There were little yellow roe-deer, which will not surprise you, for there are hundreds and thousands in Scotland to this day; and, as you know, they will thrive well enough in our woods now. There were beavers too: but that must not surprise you, for there were beavers in South Wales long after the Norman Conquest, and there are beavers still in the mountain glens of the south-east of France. There were honest little water-rats too, who I dare say sat up on their hind legs like monkeys, nibbling the water-lily pods, thousands of years ago, as they do in our ponds now. Well, so far we have come to nothing strange: but now begins the fairy tale. Mixed with all these animals, there wandered about great herds of elephants and rhinoceroses; not smooth-skinned, mind, but covered with hair and wool, like those which are still found sticking out of the everlasting ice cliffs, {{at the mouth of the}} Lena and other Siberian rivers, with the flesh, and skin, and hair so fresh upon them, that the wild wolves tear it off, and snarl and growl over the carcase of monsters who were frozen up thousands of years ago. And with them, stranger still, were great hippopotamuses; who came, perhaps, northward in summer time along the sea-shore and down the rivers, having spread hither all the way from Africa; for in those days, you must understand, Sicily, and Italy, and Malta--look at your map--were joined to the coast of Africa: and so it may be was the rock of Gibraltar itself; and over the sea where the Straits of Gibraltar now flow was firm dry land, over which hyaenas and leopards, elephants and rhinoceroses ranged into Spain; for their bones are found at this day in the Gibraltar caves. And this is the first chapter of my fairy tale.|$|R

5000|$|In {{architecture}} frost-work or frostwork {{refers to}} a style of rustication carved with a vertically-oriented pattern evoking hanging <b>pond-weed</b> or algae, or icicles. It is mainly found in garden architecture, where water is to flow over or near the surface. [...] Other decorative arts may use the term for other decorative patterns imitating frost or ice.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Pond-Weed</b> House is a {{historic}} house at corner of the old Boston Post Road and Hollow Tree Ridge Road in the Noroton section of Darien, Connecticut. It has also been known as The House Under the Hill and Half-Way House. [...] Built in 1696 by Nathaniel Weed, {{the house is a}} classic wood frame saltbox, 2-1/2 stories in height, five bays wide, with a central chimney. It is considered to be the oldest building extant in Darien.|$|E
5000|$|Often, {{especially}} from the Baroque onwards, the roughly flattened central areas of stones are indented in regular, but not too regular, patterns called [...] "pecked" [...] or [...] "picked-work", and various other ways of patterning them may be found. In garden architecture, where water was to flow over or near the surface, a vertically oriented pattern evoking hanging <b>pond-weed</b> or algae, or icicles ("frost-work") is sometimes used. [...] Also associated with gardens is [...] "cyclopian" [...] rustication, where the blocks are very large and irregular, as though placed by giants, and [...] "rock-work", where surfaces are built up of rough rocks not placed in regular courses at all. This last goes beyond rustication, and is found in fountains and follies, and later rockeries for planting.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{research on}} the metabolic activity of bacteria isolated {{from the surface of}} stems of the common reed and from the water in the pelagic zone of Moty Bay in Lake Jeziorak, {{in the presence of the}} following exogenous substrates: casein hydrolyzate, glucose, sodium succinate and sodium acetate, and in the presence of plant extracts obtained from the stems of the common reed and the leaves of floating <b>pond-weed.</b> It results from the research that epiphytic bacteria inhabiting the upper (near-surface) and lower (near-bottom) sections of the stems of the common reed were more metabolically active than plank-tonic bacteria. The best utilised substrate was casein hydrolyzate, and the most poorly was sodium acetate. In the presence of plant extracts, the metabolic activity of epiphytic bacteria was up to 13 times higher than the activity of planktonic bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Nine {{experiments}} were conducted during 1964 and 1965 {{to study the}} methods of reproduction and mode of spread of sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) in irrigation systems. Frequent treatments of sago pondweed foliage with aromatic solvent greatly {{reduced the number of}} tubers in the substratum of an irrigation canal. However, complete eradication of all tubers in one irrigation season was not obtained. Ecological investigations revealed that sago pondweed was capable of invading and becoming established in new irrigation channels in one season. The propagules responsible for the establishment of new infestations were tubers and plant fragments. Considerable numbers of sago pondweed seed were transported into the new channels by the water, but no seedlings were found. Sago <b>pond-weed</b> tubers survived freezing temperatures under field conditions. Subsequent studies in the laboratory showed that sago pondweed tubers could become somewhat hardened or conditioned to withstand freezing temperatures. Removal of the parent tuber did not affect the survival of emerged shoots nor did it prevent the growth of excised sprout tips. The main portion of the tuber appeared to have a function other than initiating growth. The study of shoot emergence from tubers indicated a relationship between the weight of the tuber and the depth from which the shoot would emerge. The main portion of the tuber, whose dry weight consists primarily of carbohydrates, may function as a food reserve enabling the shoot to emerge from a considerable depth in the soil. Sago pondweed seeds that had overwintered in a canal bottom gave 15 percent germination in a greenhouse aquarium after a 50 -day period. Seeds that had passed through the digestive tracts of wild-ducks germinated abundantly. However, if the seeds were held in the digestive tract for more than three days, no germination occurred. The storage of sago pondweed seeds at different conditions of temperature and moisture for different periods of time resulted in significant differences in the percentages of germination. Storage of seed in water at 0. 0 degrees C. for 12 days resulted in the highest percentage of germination. The seed germination studies indicated that the importance of seed in the spread of sago pondweed in irrigation systems may be underestimated...|$|E
