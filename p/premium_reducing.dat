40|$|Private equity has {{traditionally}} been thought to provide diversification benefits. However, these benefits may be lower than anticipated as we find that private equity suffers from significant exposure to the same liquidity risk factor as public equity and other alternative asset classes. The unconditional liquidity risk premium is about 3 % annually and, in a four factor model, the inclusion of this liquidity risk <b>premium</b> <b>reduces</b> alpha to zero. In addition, we provide evidence that the link between private equity returns and overall market liquidity occurs via a funding liquidity channel...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Market–based {{health care}} reform {{proposals}} typically rely on 1) consumer choice among competing health plans, 2) premiums paid out–of–pocket for higher priced plans, and 3) a significant out– of–pocket premium–price elasticity of health plan choice. Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code exempts employee out–of–pocket premiums from personal income taxes and FICA taxes. The predicted effect is attenuation of the out–of–pocket premium–price elasticity of health plan choice. Using 1994 data from a national sample of large public employers, we find that employees are sensitive to out–of–pocket premiums, but tax–exempt out–of–pocket <b>premiums</b> <b>reduce</b> substantially the price elasticity of health plan choice...|$|R
40|$|In {{a premium}} auction, the seller offers some "pay back", called premium, {{to the highest}} bidders. This paper investigates how the {{performance}} of such premium tactic {{is related to the}} participant's risk preferences. By developing an English premium auction model with symmetric interdependent values, where both the seller and the buyers may be risk averse (or preferring), we show that a) the <b>premium</b> <b>reduces</b> the riskiness of revenue regardless of the bidders' risk preferences, and b) the premium causes the expected revenue to increase in the bidders' risk tolerance. A "net-premium effect" and a "second-order stochastic dominance effect" are keys to these results. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{finds that}} changes in durable {{manufacturing}} employment and investment in computer equipment can explain rising wage dispersion in the United States, {{measured in terms of}} the education <b>premium.</b> <b>Reduced</b> employment opportunities in durables production drive down the average wage for workers with only a high school education, thereby increasing the wage premium for college education. An innovation in this paper is the inclusion of investment in equipment as a proxy for skill-biased technical change.

40|$|The {{existence}} of a value premium {{is a source of}} debate over the post- 1963 period in U. S. stock returns. We contribute to the debate by providing evidence on the long-run relationship between expected returns and market beta risk in the post- 1963 period. We show that in cross-sectional regressions returns averaged over longer periods (three to five years) are related positively and significantly to the market risk betas also computed over similar periods. Moreover, for the Fama-French 25 size and book-to-market portfolios, the market risk premium over five-year periods is estimated at a reasonable value close to 6 % per annum. When we consider a set of 55 portfolios including size and book-to-market plus industry portfolios, the value premium becomes negligible and insignificant statistically, starting at an horizon of three years.

40|$|We use {{variation}} in medical malpractice payments {{driven by the}} recent “medical malpractice crisis” to identify the causal effect of rising health insurance premiums on wages, employment {{and the distribution of}} part-time and full-time work.

For workers covered by employer provided health insurance, a 10 percent increase in premiums results in an offsetting decrease in wages of 2. 3 percent. Thus, rising health insurance premiums may both increase the ranks of the unemployed and place an increasing burden on workers through decreased wages for those with employer health insurance and decreased hours for those who may be moved from full time jobs with benefits to part time jobs without...|$|R
40|$|Perceived {{quality of}} private and public health care, income and {{insurance}} premium are among the determinants of demand for private health insurance (PHI). In {{the context of a}} model in which individuals are expected utility maximizers, the non purchasing choice can result in consuming either public health care or private health care with full cost paid out-of-pocket. This paper empirically analyses the effect of the determinants of the demand for PHI on the probability of purchasing PHI by estimating a pseudo-structural model to deal with missing data and endogeneity issues. Our findings support the hypothesis that the demand for PHI is indeed driven by the quality gap between private and public health care. As expected, PHI is a normal good and a rise in the insurance <b>premium</b> <b>reduces</b> the probability of purchasing PHI albeit displaying price elasticities smaller than one in absolute value for different groups of individuals.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the wage premium to computer {{use in a}} developing country: Ecuador. We use different approaches to establish whether the premium is causal. Controlling for a large set of observables we find a wage difference between users and non-users of around 27 %. Using first differences, the <b>premium</b> <b>reduces</b> to around 10 %. We find however, no effect {{of the number of}} hours of computer use on wages. Moreover, the premium to using pencils is very similar to the computer premium. Groups that earn a higher computer premium also earn a higher pencil premium, and the penalty/gain for losing/winning a computer are almost identical to the penalty/gain of losing/gaining pencils. Taken together, these findings suggest that also in this developing country the computer premium does not reflect a causal impact of computers on productivity, but should be attributed to unobserved worker and/or job characteristics.

40|$|The U. S. crop {{insurance}} market has several features that set it {{apart from other}} insurance markets. These include:(a) explicit government subsidies with an average premium subsidy rate of about 60 % in recent years; and (b) the legislative requirement that premium rates be set at actuarially fair levels, where the federal government sets rates and pays all costs related to insurance policy sales and services. Bearing these features in mind, we examine to what extent farmers’ {{crop insurance}} choices conform to economic theory. A standard expected utility maximization framework is set up to analyze tradeoffs between higher risk protection and larger subsidy payments. Given an actuarially fair premium, a rational farmer should choose either the coverage level with the highest premium subsidy or a higher coverage level. Evidence from a large insurance unit level dataset contradicts this theoretical inference, and so suggests anomalous insurance decisions. Mixed logit estimation reveals that larger out-of-pocket <b>premium</b> <b>reduces</b> the probability that an insurance product is chosen...|$|R

40|$|We insert {{four basic}} {{assumptions}} {{in an otherwise}} standard real business cycle model: monopolistic unions, short term nominal wage contracts, stochastic money supply and endogenous growth. The resulting economy exhibits a number of interesting features. First, unions face an uncertain labour demand prospect and, due to increasing labour disutility, impose a risk premium over the usual monopolistic wage. Second, the risk <b>premium</b> <b>reduces</b> the natural level of employment and depresses the long term rate of growth so that uncertainty reveals to be harmful on both accounts.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the effect of}} tort liability reforms on medical malpractice and general liability insurance markets. The primary reforms analyzed were damages caps and other liability reforms. These reforms decreased <b>premiums,</b> <b>reduced</b> losses, and improved the profitability of insurance companies based on evidence using detailed individual company by state data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Liability reforms reduce losses by much more than they diminish premiums. Moreover, the increase in profitability is concentrated disproportionately among the least profitable firms in the industry, thus limiting the role of competition in promoting the pass-through of cost reductions during this sample period. 21. The Impetus for Liability Reforms The mid- 1980 s marked a period of tremendous escalation in liability insurance premiums 1. Particularly for medical malpractice, product liability, and environmental liability there was a dramatic surge in premium costs. Whereas some insurance lines, such as automobile insurance, were comparatively stable, premiums for general liability and medical malpractice insurance doubled in a two-year period from 1984 - 1986. 2 Increased prices were accompanied b...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a pension model {{geared to the}} typical pension contract in the Netherlands. It {{is based on a}} defined benefit/average earnings pension system. Nominal benefits are guaranteed and indexation is intended. The model provides a framework for analysing adjustments to such factors as the asset mix, retirement age, returns and the method of discounting, premium setting and indexation. The importance of uncertainty over interest rate movements and returns on shares is made explicit by means of stochastic and historical simulations. In this, PALMNET differs from existing, often deterministic pension models. The main findings are, first, a wage -indexed defined benefit pension is still affordable despite the current shortfall of wealth of pension funds. Second, fair value accounting considerably increases the volatility of pension <b>premiums.</b> Third, <b>reducing</b> risks by adjusting the asset mix towards more bonds is costly in terms of average <b>premiums,</b> but <b>reduces</b> the volatility. These conclusions are based on realistic to conservative assumptions regarding returns and risks. Actuarial pension model; Monte Carlo simulation; historical simulation...|$|R

To compensate for lost revenues, the CSG was raised from 3.5% to 7.5%, while income from rent and capital was taxed more. This almost complete shift of employee’s health-insurance contributions to the welfare tax CGT resulted in the purchasing power of employees rising by circa 1%. Various measures were also taken to make the tax system more progressive. The Jospin Government began taxing capital assets by introducing a tax on savings, particularly life insurance. A major reform of the welfare tax CSG was carried out, which doubled the percentage share of taxes in the financial structure {{of the welfare state}} and resulted in an almost 10% fall in the share of contributions. Other measures included an increase in revenues from the wealth tax, a reduction in the lower marginal tax rate from 10.5% to 7%, a rise in taxation on profits from stock options from 40% to 50%, a 1997 increase in the exemption for the lowest tax bracket, a reduction in taxes on apartment sales, housing, and other fees, and the abolition of taxes on cars and roadways.
