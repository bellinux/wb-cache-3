5|$|From May to late August 1996 {{the park}} was closed for a $700,000 {{refurbishment}} that included repairs and upgrades to filters and pumps, automated chlorination, restoration of cement, and updating of the lighting system. The fountain was also shut down in 1997 and 1998 for 10 months while the water bureau replaced a 1930s-era pump. The <b>piping</b> was also relined with cross-linked polyethylene {{in the spring of}} spring 2000, a costly operation due to the original <b>piping</b> being cast into the concrete.|$|E
5|$|<b>Piping</b> {{was fitted}} to use cooled inert exhaust gasses in the fuel tanks {{to reduce the}} chance of fire.|$|E
5|$|Other molybdenum-based alloys that do {{not contain}} iron have only limited applications. For example, because of its {{resistance}} to molten zinc, both pure molybdenum and molybdenum/tungsten alloy (70%/30%) are used for <b>piping,</b> stirrers and pump impellers that {{come into contact with}} molten zinc.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. From {{the forests}} and {{highlands}} We come, we come; From the river-girt islands, Where loud waves are dumb Listening to my sweet <b>pipings.</b> [...] 5 The wind in the reeds and the rushes, The bees on the bells of thyme, The birds on the myrtle bushes, The cicale above in the lime, And the lizards below in the grass, [...] 10 Were as silent as ever old Tmolus was, Listening to my sweet <b>pipings.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 2. Liquid Peneus was flowing, And all dark Tempe lay In Pelion's shadow, {{outgrowing}} [...] 15 The {{light of}} the dying day, Speeded by my sweet <b>pipings.</b> The Sileni, and Sylvans, and Fauns, And the Nymphs {{of the woods and}} the waves, To the edge of the moist river-lawns, [...] 20 And the brink of the dewy caves, And all that did then attend and follow, Were silent with love, as you now, Apollo, With envy of my sweet <b>pipings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Also in {{deviation}} from the description above, on the service jacket and skiing blouse colour <b>pipings</b> or cops background colour on gorget patches are dropped.|$|R
5|$|The team {{colors are}} burgundy, steel blue, black, silver and white. For the 2007â€“08 season, the NHL {{introduced}} the new-look Rbk EDGE jerseys. The Avalanche debuted their {{new version of}} the Rbk EDGE jerseys on September 12, 2007, at an Avalanche press conference. The design is similar to the previous jerseys, with some added <b>piping.</b>|$|E
5|$|A softer {{and more}} tuneful musical call {{has been called}} the toy-trumpet call. It has been {{reported}} to foretell rainy weather. The loud bell call resembles the clinking call, and is a clear <b>piping</b> sound. Females and young make an insistent repetitive squawking when begging for food from a parent or mate, similar to the begging call of the Australian magpie, and make a gobbling sound when fed.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} <b>piping</b> raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E

5|$|Following test Baker {{decontamination}} problems, the United States Navy equipped newly constructed {{ships with}} a CounterMeasure WashDown System (CMWDS) of <b>piping</b> and nozzles to cover exterior {{surfaces of the}} ship with a spray of salt water from the firefighting system when nuclear attack appeared imminent. The film of flowing water would theoretically prevent contaminants from settling into cracks and crevices.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015, Juventus officially {{announced}} a new project called JKids for its junior supporters on its website. Along with this project, Juventus also introduced a new mascot to all its fans which is called J. J is a cartoon-designed zebra, black and white stripes with golden edge <b>piping</b> on its body, golden shining eyes, and three golden stars {{on the front of}} its neck. J made its debut at Juventus Stadium on 12 September 2015.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{buildings}} in Lower Manhattan, 32 Old Slip was battered with storm waters during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In contrast to {{most in the}} region, the building was designed to resist a powerful earthquake, which in part made the structure less prone to flooding. Within a year the building's market value declined by 21.6% ($65.7 million). In 2013 a renovation effort began to add improved flood barriers, pumps and <b>piping</b> systems to better ward against future storms.|$|E
5000|$|Similar {{developments}} {{followed with}} the officers' uniforms. After {{a period of}} unstandardised changes, these settled on the model 1910. Their smart tunic was made in a higher quality olive-green wool, incorporating the internal scalloped pockets and standing collar of the Austrian army, but with branch <b>pipings</b> and Russian-style rank boards. The headgear was a khaki kepi with leather peak, gold-metal <b>pipings</b> (silver for Cavalry and Engineers) and a bullion-cockade, and the pants were piped riding breeches, usually worn with high boots or ankle boots and puttees. The equipment was brown leather, with a French-style pistol holster and a binocular case. During this period, all officers took their sabres on campaign.|$|R
50|$|This uniform {{included}} a near-copy of the British four-pocket tunic of the time, in olive green wool cloth or serge, {{with the addition}} of <b>pipings</b> and removable shoulder boards in branch-of-service colour cloth (Red: Infantry and Staff; Bright red-purple: Cavalry; Dark red-burgundy: Artillery; Light Blue: Engineers; Dark Blue: Gendarmerie). Brass-metal buttons were used for the majority of uniforms. The pants were straight with side <b>pipings,</b> designed to cover the ankle lace-boots, but in campaign the majority of soldiers found these cumbersome and used cloth puttees or stuffed them in their boots to hold them tight. A khaki single-breasted greatcoat was issued for winter. The black equipment was also replaced by a natural-brown leather set.|$|R
50|$|The officers' uniform changed though significantly, {{adopting}} {{the changes that}} were already implemented by King Constantine and his staff in their private tunics, plus {{a return to the}} German-style cap that Constantine preferred. The new tunic was more practical for campaign, closer to the modern French and British styles. Wider-cut, it had bigger, external pockets pleated on the breast, scalloped flaps and stand and fall collar. The <b>pipings</b> were replaced by a pair of branch-colour collar tabs with metal buttons and the Russian boards were replaced by smaller straps. The highly visible cap metal <b>pipings</b> were replaced with subdued rank stripes of brown colour. The old-style leather equipment was replaced by a fashionable Sam Browne and a Webley revolver-style holster.|$|R
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{produces}} {{a variety of}} calls, including a <b>piping</b> call around {{half an hour before}} dawn, variously described as ki-owt, woik, queet, peet, or weet. Through the day, it makes squeaking noises while flying, and harsh squawks when mobbing. Its calls have been likened to those of the yellow-throated miner (Manorina flavigula), but are deeper. Blue-faced honeyeaters make a soft chirping around nestlings and family members.|$|E
5|$|Until 2009 {{the wearing}} of Boat Club Jackets (ivory with navy blue <b>piping</b> and cuff rings, bearing the three ostrich feather emblem on the left breast) {{was limited to the}} 1st and 2nd Summer VIII's and Torpids and the Oriel College Boat Club Committee. At that time cuff ring designations were: Three rings for 1st Summer VIII and 1st Torpid; two rings for Boat Club Committee; one ring for 2nd Summer VIII 2nd Torpid. These now {{obsolete}} designations can still seen at the Walters of Oxford website.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{wildlife}} {{can be found in}} and around Matagorda Bay. The Mad Island-Oyster Lake conservation area, located on the eastern shore of Matagorda Bay, is a habitat for over 300 species of birds including songbirds, shorebirds and waterfowl. More species of birds were found in the area than any other in the nation during the National Audubon Society's annual Christmas Bird Count from 2000 to 2002. Other fauna located along the bay include bobcats, white-tailed deer, river otters, Texas horned lizards, reddish egret, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, the <b>piping</b> plover and alligators.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} galloons and <b>pipings</b> for enlisted {{ranks and}} NCOs {{were made from}} yellow sheeps wool, for Ensigns since 1908 from yellow silk, and for officers from gold yarn. Pertaining private procured special editions to enlisted ranks and NCOs, silk trims have been allowed as well.|$|R
60|$|The {{starlings}} swung {{in thousands}} round the reed-ronds, looking {{to settle in}} their wonted place: but dare not; and rose and swung round again, telling each other, in their manifold <b>pipings,</b> how all the reed-ronds teemed with mailed men. And all above, the sky was cloudless blue.|$|R
6000|$|... "Once, O Ngurn," [...] he said, {{not taking}} {{his eyes from the}} sheening, {{vibrating}} surface whereon and wherein all the shades of cherry-red played unceasingly, ever a-quiver to change into sound, to become silken rustlings, silvery whisperings, golden thrummings of cords, velvet <b>pipings</b> of elfland, mellow distances of thunderings.|$|R
5|$|In 1908 the Women's Civic Improvement Club petitioned for the {{creation}} of community space along Ashland Creek, which became Ashland Canyon Park. The discovery of lithia water near Emigrant Lake around the same time led to a plan to establish a mineral spa at the park. Voters approved bonds to pay for the project, which included <b>piping</b> the mineral water from its source to Ashland. The town engaged John McLaren, landscape architect of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, to design the park, renamed Lithia Springs Park, later shortened to Lithia Park. Although the park was popular, the mineral spa plans proved too expensive for local taxpayers and were abandoned in 1916. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs took to bottling and selling mineral waters from the area's springs.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Ball {{was one of}} six {{recipients}} of the Victoria Cross to be featured on a special commemorative edition of Royal Mail stamps marking the 150th anniversary of the award. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Nottingham Castle Museum along with his other medals and memorabilia, including a bullet-holed Avro windshield, a section of engine <b>piping</b> {{from one of his}} damaged Nieuports, his Freedom of Nottingham Scroll and Casket, and various letters and other papers. A portrait study by Noel Denholm Davis is in the collection of Nottingham City Museums and Galleries.|$|E
5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend {{to specialize in}} either the liquid or dry bulk trade. Also, these ships have endemic maintenance problems. On one hand, due to a less specialized design, an OBO suffers more from wear and tear during dry cargo onload than a bulker. On the other hand, components of the liquid cargo system, from pumps to valves to <b>piping,</b> tend to develop problems when subjected to periods of disuse. These factors have contributed to a steady {{reduction in the number}} of OBO ships worldwide since the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{there are}} two {{different}} kinds of field jackets worn on away missions. They have zippered pockets and the same colored <b>pipings</b> as the jumpsuits, as well as cold weather gear, pressure suits, spacesuits, an EV undersuit, and a royal blue undergarment with slight differences on male and female garments.|$|R
50|$|The first uniforms {{had been}} {{designed}} by a Parisian tailor and consisted of a green coat and grey trousers, {{similar to that of}} the Silesian rifles, but distinguished from them by the black facing colour, red <b>pipings</b> at collar, cuffs and pane, and French-style cuffs. The soldiers wore black felt shakos.|$|R
6000|$|... "Know him? jest guess I do! His name is Jim Haskett, {{and he used}} to be {{the mate}} of the Sunflower, a three-master from Penobscot. I sailed under him once, and he was the hardest man on {{shipboard}} I ever got next to. If he gets in the navy, he'll make everybody under him dance to his <b>pipings,</b> and worse." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Ashton-under-Lyne's growth made it {{necessary}} {{to find a new}} water supply. Before the introduction of piped water the town's inhabitants drew water from wells and the nearby River Tame. Industrial processes had polluted the river however, and the wells could not sustain a rapidly expanding population. From 1825, a private company was responsible for <b>piping</b> water from reservoirs, but there were still many homes without proper drainage or water supply. Today, waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority.|$|E
5|$|Laguna Madre {{is home to}} more finfish than {{anywhere}} else on the Texas coast, with such species as blue catfish, hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, black drum, red drum, southern flounder, alligator gar, houndfish, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, Atlantic midshipman, mojarras, striped mullet, pinfish, Florida pompano, smooth butterfly ray, spotted seatrout, blacktip shark, sheepshead, bigmouth sleeper, gray snapper, common snook, southern stargazer, southern stingray and tripletail. Many fowl migrate and live around the lagoon including 75% of all redhead ducks. Other birds in the area include the peregrine falcon, <b>piping</b> plover, roseate spoonbill, long-billed curlew, crane, egret and the brown pelican. Sea turtles and dolphins {{can be found in}} the bay, while cattle, white-tailed deer, nilgai and bobcats can sometimes be seen near the shore.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{is located}} along the Atlantic Flyway, a major route for migratory {{waterfowl}} {{along the eastern}} coast. Lakes in central Massachusetts provide habitat for many species of fish and waterfowl, but some species such as the common loon are becoming rare. A significant population of long-tailed ducks winter off Nantucket. Small offshore islands and beaches are home to roseate terns and are important breeding areas for the locally threatened <b>piping</b> plover. Protected {{areas such as the}} Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge provide critical breeding habitat for shorebirds and a variety of marine wildlife including a large population of grey seals.|$|E
60|$|Arose a thin twittering, like elfin <b>pipings,</b> {{with sharp}} pitches and excited shrillnesses, to which Dick and Paula lent delighted ears, till, suddenly, with the abruptness of the trump of doom, all the microphonic chorus {{of the tiny}} golden lovers was swept away, obliterated, in a Gargantuan blast of sound--no less wild, no less musical, no less passionate with love, but immense, dominant, {{compelling}} by very vastitude of volume.|$|R
5000|$|Professor {{and author}} Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. {{recommended}} Smith {{as a potential}} candidate for an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Harvard University in 1893. Harvard president Charles William Eliot declined, noting that My Country 'Tis of Thee was better known for its tune, which Smith did not write, rather than its lyrics. Holmes disagreed, noting that [...] "his song will be sung centuries from now, when most of us and our <b>pipings</b> are forgotten." ...|$|R
5000|$|The power {{differences}} {{stem from}} types of vehicles and routing of necessary <b>pipings,</b> as well types of manifold with different features.
