40|$|Background: Trans-scaphoid <b>perilunate</b> <b>fracture-dislocation</b> and perilunate dislocations {{are among}} {{uncommon}} injuries, most commonly seen in young patients {{due to high}} energy trauma. The treatment can be achieved either surgically by open reduc tion and internal fixation or closed reduction and casting.   Methods: To compare surgical versus non-operative results of treatment of trans-scaphoid <b>perilunate</b> <b>fracture-dislocation</b> and isolated perilunate dislocation, we collected the data of 34 patients who were treated at least 5 years before our study, twenty of whom were treated surgically and fourteen were treated nonsurgical. We compared clinical and radiological findings in two groups. Functional outcome was assessed by Mayo wrist score for each patient. Results: The surgically treated patients had much higher Mayo wrist scores, 85 and 87. 78 for perilunate dislocation and trans-scaphoid fracture-dislocation respectively, while 71 and 71. 11 in non-surgically treated group respectively. Wrist range of motion was also more favorable in operative group (55 flexion - 54. 28 extension for trans-scaphoid fracture-dislocations and 50 flexion, 51. 66 extension for perilunate dislocations) than non-operative group(48. 5 flexion, 48. 1 extension for trans-scaphoid fracture-dislocations and 48. 1 flexion, 50 extension for perilunate dislocation). The radiographic changes showed arthritic changes but those changes did not significantly interfered with functional outcome and wrist scores. Conclusion: Regarding our better clinical results after early open reduction and internal fixation for these injuries, we can suggest the operativetreatment of these complicated hand injuries...|$|E
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONPerilunate dislocations {{represent}} one of {{the most}} devastating injuries to the carpus. Fortunately, these injuries are relatively rare, constituting approximately 10 % of all carpal injuries. One of the problems associated with this injury is the difﬁculty of its accurate and early recognition. PRESENTATION OF CASEIn this study, an uncommon case of bilateral dorsal trans-scaphoid <b>perilunate</b> <b>fracture–dislocation</b> following trauma has been reported. The injury was missed initially and the patient was subsequently operated after two weeks. Anatomic reduction was achieved by closed reduction. After closed reduction, percutaneous pin fixation of the carpus was performed using Kirschner wires. Finally, the scaphoid was stabilized with a headless screw percutaneously. The same procedure was repeated for the other wrist. This was followed by an uneventful post-operative period, with a satisfactory functional outcome at the two-year follow-up, despite non-union of the scaphoid in one side. DISCUSSIONThe case was examined in detail, and compared to the findings in the literature; observations regarding fracture prognosis were also made. Most authors agree that closed reduction is the initial treatment of choice for trans-scaphoid perilunate fracture–dislocations. In addition, treatment often requires intercarpal fixation within the proximal carpal row. CONCLUSIONWe believe that closed reduction in these cases should be attempted regarding the potential risks of avascular necrosis and non-union of the affected carpal bones due to open reduction...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively assess {{surgeries}} {{performed in}} patients with perilunate dislocations without associated fractures, who were operated using the closed reduction and percutaneous fixation method. The follow-up time ranged from one to seven years. METHODS: 628 patient records with traumatic wrist injuries, operated by {{the same group of}} Hand Surgeons between 2008 and 2014 due to acute trauma were collected, with a mean follow-up of 3. 2 years. Of these, 51 were cases of <b>perilunate</b> <b>fracture-dislocations,</b> and 38 were pure perilunate dislocations without associated fractures; of these, only 32 underwent percutaneous fixation without ligamentous repair, thus meeting the inclusion criteria. Of the nine patients with perilunate dislocations who were treated using the closed reduction and percutaneous fixation method, whose mean age was 38 years (range 26 - 49 years), the dominant side was the left in two-thirds of the cases, and the predominant trauma mechanism was direct trauma. RESULTS: This study is in agreement with the literature, showing that cases treated early present good results. CONCLUSION: 88 % of patients who were treated by closed reduction and percutaneous fixation method maintained their daily activities and were assessed as excellent or good by the Clinical Scoring Chart...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Leaving {{extensor}} pollicis longus (EPL) tendon {{out of the}} retinaculum {{in cases}} performed through a dorsal approach {{at the level of}} the extensor retinaculum after opening the 3 rd extensor compartment reduces risk of adhesion and rupture. The aim of this study was to attempt to understand whether leaving EPL in the subcutaneous tissue that is released from the extensor compartment during surgery, without reconstructing the third extensor compartment, causes any change to extension strength and range of motion (ROM) of the interphalangeal (IP) and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of the thumb. Patients and methods: 20 patients operated on between 1995 and 2013 were evaluated retrospectively. The EPL tendons of all patients were left out of the extensor retinaculum after opening the 3 rd extensor compartment through a dorsal approach to wrist. The following surgeries were performed: wrist arthrodesis in four patients, vascularized bone flaps from the 4 th ECA (extensor compartmental artery) for Kienbock's disease in two patients, open reduction after <b>perilunate</b> <b>fracture-dislocations</b> in two patients, proximal row carpectomy after Kienbock's disease in two patients, and distal radius fracture surgery through a dorsal approach in six patients. Extension strength (in kg) and voluntary ROM (in degree) of the MCP and IP joints of the thumb were measured. Opposite extremity values were assessed and compared statistically. Results: No statistically significant reduction was determined in strength and ROM of IP and MCP joints of the thumb on the operated side of patients whose EPLs were left out of the retinaculum compared with the non-operated side. Conclusion: It was determined that leaving the EPL tendon out of the retinaculum in cases with increased risk of adhesions and rupture did not cause marked muscle weakness or loss of range of movement.
