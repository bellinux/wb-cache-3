40|$|Historically, {{cryogenic}} pumps {{used for}} propellant loading at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and other NASA Centers have a bellows mechanical seal and oil bath ball bearings, {{both of which}} can be problematic and require high maintenance. Because of the extremely low temperatures, the mechanical seals are made of special materials and design, have wearing surfaces, are subject to improper installation, and commonly are a potential leak path. The ball bearings are non-precision bearings [ABEC- 1 (Annular Bearing Engineering Council) ] and are lubricated using LOX compatible oil. This oil is compatible with the propellant to prevent explosions, but does not have good lubricating properties. Due to the poor lubricity, it has been a goal of the KSC cryogenics community for the last 15 years to develop a magnetically coupled pump, which would eliminate these two potential issues. A number of projects have been attempted, but none of the pumps was a success. An off-the-shelf magnetically coupled pump (typically used with corrosive fluids) was procured that has been used for hypergolic service at KSC. The KSC Cryogenics Test Lab (CTL) operated the pump in cryogenic LN 2 as received to determine a baseline for modifications required. The <b>pump</b> <b>bushing,</b> bearings, and thrust rings failed, and the pump would not flow liquid (this is a typical failure mode that was experienced in the previous attempts). Using the knowledge gained over the years designing and building cryogenic pumps, the CTL determined alternative materials that would be suitable for use under the pump design conditions. The CTL procured alternative materials for the bearings (bronze, aluminum bronze, and glass filled PTFE) and machined new bearing bushings, sleeves, and thrust rings. The designed clearances among the bushings, sleeves, thrust rings, case, and case cover were altered once again using experience gained from previous cryogenic pump rebuilds and designs. The alternative material parts were assembled into the pump, and the pump was successfully operated meeting all expected operating parameters. Unique pump sub-assembly parts were designed and manufactured by the CTL using specialized materials determined to be superior for cryogenic thermal applications under the pump design conditions. This work is a proof-of-concept/proof-of-operation of the pump only. Other known internal design modifications to the pump should be accomplished for the long-term use of the pump. An upscaled version of this pump, which is under development and testing at the CTL, can be used either for current or future vehicle loading or for vehicle replenishment. Scaling of this pump can be easily accomplished...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>bush</b> <b>pump,</b> {{also known}} as the Zimbabwe <b>bush</b> <b>pump,</b> is a {{positive}} displacement pump based on lever action [...] used to extract water from a bore hole well. It is the standard hand pump in Zimbabwe, and is used in Zimbabwe and Namibia. There are approximately 40 000 pumps (2009) in Zimbabwe, and annually about 3000 pumps are installed.|$|R
50|$|As other {{positive}} displacement <b>pumps</b> the <b>Bush</b> <b>Pump</b> is constructed around a down-hole cylinder containing a piston, that lifts water with every lever stroke. The pump's signifying {{feature is the}} hardwood block {{that acts as a}} bearing and its lever mechanism. Besides this, the pump has an untraditional construction where the well base is bolted directly {{to the top of the}} well casing, sticking out of the bore hole. It extracts water from a depth up of 18 to 100m, and can support a usage up to 250 people.|$|R
50|$|Laet and Mol {{argue that}} {{their way of}} {{analyzing}} the <b>bush</b> <b>pump</b> can be helpful when trying to understand {{a wide variety of}} objects and practices.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} version was designed in 1933 as a closed-top cylinder pump. Around 1960 the design was modernized. The {{base of the}} well was from then on bolted to the well casing. It {{was at this point}} the pump got its current name, and this design became the national standard for hand pumps in Zimbabwe. After Zimbabwe’s independence in 1980, the government created its own modernized version of the <b>pump,</b> B-type Zimbabwe <b>Bush</b> <b>Pump.</b> The new pump integrated the features from the earlier pumps. This is the current standard [...] (2009).|$|R

Combine harvester is use to overcome shortage of manpower in agriculture sector. Repair and maintenance cost is the main factor in order to select a new or second hand combine harvester because the capacity or age of the machine may increase the cost of repair and maintenance. Common model of combine harvester that is mainly use in Malaysia is New Holland. The {{research was}} conducted in Langkawi and Kota Setar district. This research is significant for the conductor or owner to decide the best combine harvester before purchasing. The combine harvester with several ability and durability that can enhance {{the efficiency of the}} combine harvester in harvesting operation. Cross section survey that is use to collect the data and regression and correlation matrix is the data interpreted result in the research model. The distribution of critical parts have changed during repair and maintenance cost activities are ground speed vari-drive (24 %), shaft tire (18 %) and grain elevator drive (9 %), for the maintenance in off season the part normally changed are wheel, conveyor belt and <b>pump</b> <b>bush</b> track (10 %), Soucy track (9 %), and, straw walker and header (8 %). Combine harvester need to be repair and maintenance after usage in between 60 I to 900 hours in seasons. The owner or farmer need to repair and maintained the combine harvester to reduce the factor that enhance combine harvester breakdown. This problem needs to overcome to reduce the losses to owner of combine harvester. Machinery cost is the secondary highest cost after own the land...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the intricacies of}} an admirable water pumping device - the Zimbabwe <b>Bush</b> <b>Pump</b> `B' type - so as {{to find out what}} makes it an `appropriate technology'. This turns out to be what we call the `fluidity' of the pump (of its boundaries, or of its working order, and of its maker). We find that in travelling to intractable places, an object that isn't too rigorously bounded, that doesn't impose itself but tries to serve, that is adaptable, flexible and responsive - in short, a fluid object - may well prove to be stronger than one which is firm. By analyzing the success and failure of this device, its agency {{and the way in which}} it shapes new configurations in the Zimbabwean socio-technical landscape, we partake in the current move in science and technology studies to transform what it means to be an actor. And by mobilizing the term love for articulating our relation to the <b>Bush</b> <b>Pump,</b> we try to contribute to shaping novel ways of `doing' normativity. ...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{aspect of}} the pump’s {{fluidity}} is that its boundaries are not solid and sharp. The Pump is a mechanical object, it is a hydraulic system, {{but it is also}} a device installed by the community, a health promoter and a nation-building apparatus. It has each of these identities - and each comes with its own different boundaries. ... In each of its identities the <b>Bush</b> <b>Pump</b> contains a variant of its environment.|$|R
40|$|Inspired by de Laet and Mol’s classic {{article on}} the Zimbabwean <b>Bush</b> <b>Pump</b> and Peter Redfield’s revival of {{fluidity}} as a central characteristic of humanitarian design, this paper argues that many humanitarian technologies are characterized {{not so much by}} fluidity as by stickiness. Sticky technologies lie somewhere between fluid technologies and Latourian immutable mobiles: They work precisely because they are mobile and not overly adaptable, yet they retain some flexibility by reaching out to shape and be shaped by their users. The concept is introduced through a detailed study of Plumpy’nut®, a peanut paste for therapeutic feeding that is materially sticky – much firmer than a fluid, yet still mutable – as well as conceptually sticky. ‘Stickiness’ can have wide utility for thinking through technology and humanitarianism...|$|R
40|$|Law's article {{begins by}} restating the {{classical}} ANT position that objects {{do not exist}} `in themselves' but are {{the effect of a}} performative stabilization of relational networks. In addition, these material enactments inevitably have a spatial dimension; they simultaneously establish spatial conditions for objectual identity, continuity, and difference. Space must not be reified as a natural, pre-existing container of the social and the material, but is itself a performance. Moreover, there are multiple forms of spatiality beyond the Euclidean space of regions (e. g. networks and fluids), and objects may exist and achieve homeomorphism within several different spatial systems. Technologies such as the Zimbabwe <b>Bush</b> <b>Pump</b> present a fluid object which is able to exist and cohere without the presence of fixed boundaries or the permanence of a particular functional definition. The network logic, however, which gravitates towards stability and functionality, tends to exclude and silence this spatial Other. An alternative political ontology is needed which goes beyond the reification of network space in order to give voice to the fluid objects which escape its unidimensional functionality...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>bush</b> <b>pump</b> {{has been}} the subject of {{scholarly}} studies. In their article, “The Zimbabwe Bush Pump: Mechanics of a Fluid Technology", Marianne de Laet and Annemarie Mol analyze the pumps role as an appropriate technology. They focus on the fluidity of the pump, meaning its flexibility both when it comes to how it was invented, how it is used, and what function it has. They make their case by showing that the pump was not invented by one human actor (the opposite of what they call heroic actorship), but through a slow process of fluid actorship, where there is not one clear human creator. The use of the pump is also fluid, it does not only give water to a community, but the construction of the pump can serve an important ceremonial function both locally and nationally. The pump can also be said to be fluid in how it reacts to decay. Even if seemingly essential parts of it mechanics is broken; it can serve functions not intended by any of its creators. The pump is not only its physical appearance or its technical description, Laet and Mol argues: ...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of development activities {{in water and}} other sectors can be improved through a broad-based analysis of livelihoods and {{the factors that influence}} them, including the wider â€˜vulnerability contextâ€™ in which people live. It is also important to ascertain the role that water resources play in combination with other â€˜assetsâ€™ to support economic and human activities. A research study was carried out between December 2009 and April 2010. Its aim was to assess the impact made by the water supply and sanitation programmes implemented by Zvishavane Water Project and World Vision Zimbabwe in Chivi District of Zimbabwe since 2005. Wards 7, 9 and 15 were studied. Ward 9 and 15 had water supply and sanitation programmes, while Ward 7 had no water supply and sanitation programme since the IRWSSP. This allowed comparison of livelihoods between the wards which had programmes and that which did not. The impact was assessed in terms of design, functionality, usage and livelihoods. The design, functionality and usage were assessed using design criteria obtained from literature, while the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) was used to assess impact made on the livelihoods of the rural poor. The methods used to collect data were household survey, in which 90 households were interviewed per ward in the three wards. Focus group discussions with men, women, youths and water point committees in each ward were done as well as field visits and observations. Key informant interviews were done with staff from Agricultural Extension (AGRITEX), District Development Staff (DDF), Ministry of Health and the Rural District Council (RDC). Six school headmasters were interviewed to ascertain the impact made by the programmes and diarrheal and cholera disease prevalent records were obtained from three health centres. The results obtained show that Wards 9 and 15 had a better choice of water technologies (Elephant Pump and Windlass respectively and B-type <b>bush</b> <b>pump</b> for both), which were low cost and therefore better designs than Ward 7, which only had the B-type <b>bush</b> <b>pump.</b> Functionality and usage was high in the three wards. Impact has been made by water supply and sanitation programmes implemented by ZWP and WVZ in Ward 9 and 15 compared to Ward 7 which has not had a programme. The physical, natural and human capitals were more supported by water supply and sanitation programmes, than the social and financial capitals. It was concluded that the design of water and sanitation facilities influences functionality and use of the facilities. This subsequently affects the impact made by the facilities. The financial and social capitals are not rooted firmly in water supply and sanitation programmes, unlike the physical, natural and human capitals. The study therefore recommends that NGOs should implement, with support from Government, more of low cost technologies, which communities can look after using locally available materials as this will ensure sustainability and therefore sustained impact. Extensive geological surveys should be done before water point development to ensure that wells have a greater depth and therefore yield more. This will enable use of water for productive purposes which encourage continued functionality of water points, thereby ensuring sustainable impact.,WATERne...|$|R
