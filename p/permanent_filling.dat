40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the ultimate compressive strength of 50 % and 25 % Portland cement mixed with Polymer-reinforced zinc oxide eugenol and zinc oxide eugenol cement after 1 hour, 24 hours, and 7 days. Materials and Methods: One hundred and eighty samples were selected. The samples were made cylindrical of size 6 × 8 mm and were divided into six groups as follows with each group consisting of 10 samples. Group 1 : Polymer-reinforced zinc oxide eugenol with 50 % Portland cement (PMZNPC 50 %) Group 2 : Polymer-reinforced zinc oxide eugenol with 25 % Portland cement (PMZNPC 25 %) Group 3 : Polymer-reinforced zinc oxide eugenol with 0 % Portland cement (PMZNPC 0 %) Group 4 : Zinc oxide eugenol with 50 % Portland cement (ZNPC 50 %) Group 5 : Zinc oxide eugenol with 25 % Portland cement (ZNPC 25 %) Group 6 : Zinc oxide eugenol with 0 % Portland cement (ZNPC 0 %) These samples were further subdivided based on time interval and were tested at 1 hour, 24 hours and at 7 th day. After each period of time all the specimens were tested by vertical CVR loaded frame with capacity of 5 tones/ 0473 - 10 kan National Physical laboratory, New Delhi and the results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Scheffe test. Results: Polymer-reinforced cement with 50 % Portland cement, Zinc oxide with 50 % Portland cement, Polymer-reinforced cement with 25 % Portland cement and Zinc oxide with 25 % Portland cement exhibited higher compressive strength when compared to Zinc oxide with 0 % Portland cement and Polymer-reinforced cement with 0 % Portland cement, at different periods of time. The difference between these two groups were statistically significant (P < 0. 05) and it is suggested that mixture of 50 % and 25 % Portland cement in Zinc oxide eugenol and Polymer-modified zinc oxide cement can be used as core build up material and <b>permanent</b> <b>filling</b> material. Conclusion: It is concluded that 50 % and 25 % Portland cement in zinc oxide eugenol and polymer-modified zinc oxide eugenol results in higher compressive strength and hence can be used as <b>permanent</b> <b>filling</b> material and core built-up material...|$|E

A prospectively attained series of 85 patients with delayed-onset complications after facial injection with permanent fillers underwent clinical follow-up and treatment of the complications. Lag times until onset and type of delayed-onset complication varied according to filler material. In 28 % (n = 24) of the cases, patients reported the onset of complications after dental procedures, additional injections with fillers, or other invasive treatments in the facial area. Forty-eight (57 %) patients required invasive treatment. Abscess formation was significantly more frequent in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and facial lipoatrophy (p =. 001). The intrinsic characteristics of the injected filler and the immune status of the patient play important roles in the diversity of time of onset and type of delayed-onset adverse events observed.

40|$|Dental disease {{annually}} affects {{billions of}} patients, and while regenerative dentistry aims to heal dental tissue after injury, existing polymeric restorative materials, or fillings, do not directly {{participate in the}} healing process in a bioinstructive manner. There {{is a need for}} restorative materials that can support native functions of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), which are capable of regenerating dentin. A polymer microarray formed from commercially available monomers to rapidly identify materials that support DPSC adhesion is used. Based on these findings, thiol-ene chemistry is employed to achieve rapid light-curing and minimize residual monomer of the lead materials. Several triacrylate bulk polymers support DPSC adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation in vitro, and exhibit stiffness and tensile strength similar to existing dental materials. Conversely, materials composed of a trimethacrylate monomer or bisphenol A glycidyl methacrylate, which is a monomer standard in dental materials, do not support stem cell adhesion and negatively impact matrix and signaling pathways.

40|$|Introduction: The {{three-dimensional}} hermetic {{root canal}} obturation that implies sealing of the apical and the coronal {{part of the}} tooth, presents one of the conditions for successful prognosis for endodontic therapy. Aim: The goal {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate periapical post endodontic status of coronary obturated teeth with temporary and <b>permanent</b> <b>filling</b> on in vivo conditions. Study design: The investigation was performed on experimental animals-dogs. Endodontic therapy treatment was realised on 20 incisors, and the coronal temporal cavities were obtured with Caviton (10 teeth) as well as composite resin (10 teeth). Control Rtg for analysis of the periapical conditional state were conveyed after the therapy and after 3 and 6 months as well. The surface of periapical radiolucence of the teeth was determined using the compjuter program Image Tool 3. Results: Using the in vivo conditioned terms with the experimental animals 3 months after the endodontic therapy, the surface of the average periapical lesions of the teeth that were previously coronal sealed with temporal material as well as with composite resin were statistically significant different [...] After a 6 month period, the permanently restored teeth reacted with digression of the surface of the periapical lesions. Conclusions: After the three-dimensional hermetic root canal obturation permanent coronal restoration follows. 	The time of application and the success rate of the endodontic act as far as the prognosis, crucially determines the survival of the dental organ in the oral environment. ...|$|E

MethodsA cross-sectional study was carried out using a representative sample (n= 1217) of the population of 12 -yearold schoolchildren in Galiza (northwest Spain). Independent variables were measured through a questionnaire, and dependent variables were determined through oral examination. Multiple and logistic regression were applied. ResultsThe decayed, missing and <b>filled</b> <b>permanent</b> teeth/decayed, <b>filled</b> primary teeth (DMFT-dft) value in the sample was 1. 83 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 67 - 1. 98), the DMFT value was 1. 53 (95 % CI, 1. 37 - 1. 67), and the prevalence of caries was 61 % (95 % CI, 57. 7 - 64. 5). The prevalence of caries was directly related to a low frequency of brushing, greater use of toothpaste, and a higher consumption of sweets. The prevalence of caries was higher in rural than in urban areas. In contrast, the higher the mother's level of education and the greater the subject's knowledge of dental health, the lower the prevalence of caries. ConclusionsThe main goals of dental health programmes should be to achieve quality brushing every day in children, to reduce the consumption of sweets, and to increase knowledge of dental health...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Treatment of non-vital {{immature}} {{teeth with}} apical periodontitis {{has always been}} a challenge in Endodontics. Regenerative endodontic treatment (RET) has been successfully used for the management of these cases. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a case of RET used for the retreatment of a previously endodontically treated permanent tooth with an open apex. A 14 -year-old boy with a poor endodontic treatment done on his maxillary right central incisor developed symptomatic apical periodontitis. Radiographically, incomplete root development with thin dentinal walls and an open apex were evident. After accessing and removing previous filling materials, the canal was copiously irrigated with 2. 5 % sodium hypochlorite. A triple antibiotic paste was placed inside the canal and left for 15 days. After removal of the antibiotic mixture, bleeding was induced into the canal by passing a hand file out of the apex. A collagen membrane barrier was placed over the blood clot, followed by sealing with mineral trioxide aggregate. Access was sealed with <b>permanent</b> <b>filling</b> materials. Clinical examination at 12, 24 and 36 months revealed no symptoms. Radiographic examination showed resolution of the periapical lesion and apical closure. Sensitivity tests with cold and an electric pulp test elicited a negative response at all recall periods.

40|$|Endodontic therapy {{consists}} in cleaning and shaping the root canal system, removing organic debris and sealing the intra-canal space with <b>permanent</b> <b>filling</b> materials. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate various root canal fillings in order to detect material defects, the marginal adaptation at the root canal walls and to assess the quality of the apical sealing. 21 extracted single-root canal human teeth were selected for this study. We instrumented all roots using NiTi rotary instruments. All canals were enlarged with a 6 % taper size 30 GT instrument, 0, 5 mm from the anatomical apex. The root canals were irrigated with 5 % sodium hypochlorite, followed by 17 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). After the instrumentation was completed, the root canals were obturated using a thermoplasticizable polymer of polyesters. In order to assess the defects inside the filling material and the marginal fit to the root canal walls, the cone-beam micro-computed tomography (CBÎ¼CT) was used first. After the CBÎ¼CT investigation, time domain optical coherence tomography working in en face mode (TDefOCT) was employed to evaluate the previous samples. The TDefOCT system was working at 1300 nm and was doubled by a confocal channel at 970 nm. The results obtained by CBÎ¼CT revealed no visible defects inside the root-canal fillings and at the interfaces with the root-canal walls.

This study concerns 21 non-vital deciduous molars. X-rays excluded any lesion of the underlying permanent bony crypt (bone tissue) as well as any inflammation of the dental follicle. After preparation, root canals were filled by means of Pulpdent. An initial X-ray check was made 15 days and then every 3 months. After disappearance of the inflammatory resorption, root canal fillings were performed with ZOE paste. The remineralisation of the inter-radicular alveolar bone was observed for 14 deciduous molars, which were then filled using ZOE. The remineralisation period varies from 3 to 18 months depending on the scale of the lesion. Of the 7 failed treatments, 3 failed following downfall of the crown filling material, and 2 due to failure to keep appointments and late replacement of resorbed Ca(OH) 2. On 2 teeth, the treatment did not stop the lesion forming. Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) give encouraging results in the treatment of inter-radicular alveolar bone resorption of non-vital deciduous tooth.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANT: Data were collected on 74, 467 children aged 5 - 12 years attending school dental services in Australia (data were not available for Victoria or New South Wales). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical oral health {{was determined by the}} mean number of permanent teeth with untreated caries, missing and <b>filled</b> <b>permanent</b> teeth, and the mean decayed, missing and <b>filled</b> <b>permanent</b> teeth index (DMFT) of 8 to 12 -year-old-children and the mean number deciduous teeth with untreated caries, missing and filled deciduous teeth, and the mean decayed, missing and filled deciduous teeth index (dmft) of 5 - 10 -year-olds. RESULTS: The multivariable models that included coefficients on whether the child was Indigenous, from an area with fluoridated water and SES, were controlled for age and sex. The mean DMFT of 8 - 12 -year-old children and the mean dmft of 5 - 10 -year-old-children were significantly higher in rural areas compared with urban centres after accounting for Indigenous status, fluoridated water and SES.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the long-term effects of chemotherapy on the dental and gingival health and dental disturbance parameters of children cancer survivors. Procedure: Thirty-eight children (mean age 12. 2 +/- 0. 5 years) who underwent chemotherapy at 4. 29 +/- 1. 71 years of age formed the study group. Forty age- and gender-matched healthy children with a similar socioeconomic background served as controls. Subjects' caries status (number of decayed, missing, or <b>filled</b> <b>permanent</b> teeth [DMF-T]) was recorded according to World Health Organization criteria. Subjects' periodontal status was recorded according to the community periodontal index system. Radiographic dental examination was used to analyze dental malformations. Results: DMF-T, D-T (number of decayed permanent teeth), and F-T (number of <b>filled</b> <b>permanent</b> teeth) were significantly higher in the study group compared to the controls (4. 61 +/- 3. 71, 3. 97 +/- 4. 45, respectively, and 0. 58 +/- 0. 14 vs. 2. 21 +/- 1. 01, 0. 84 +/- 1. 82, and 1. 18 +/- 1. 07, respectively. The most frequent dental disturbances were root malformation (52. 6 %) and agenesis (47. 4 %). Conclusions: According to our examination dental status of long-term survivors is worse than in controls. Hence proper oral hygiene for children cancer survivors (CCS) is critical.

40|$|Propolis, or {{bee glue}} {{is a natural}} wax-like {{resinous}} substance collected by bees from buds and exudates of the plants (Kuropatnicki et al, 2013). Honey bees used propolis as antibiotic, seal hole or cracks of its combs, and also protect it from insects (Bogdanov (2017). Propolis has been used since long time ago as traditional medicine due to its several biological properties, such as antibacterial (Sforcin et al, 2000), anti-inflamatory (Wang et al, 2014), and immunomodulatory (Sforcin, 2007). Among of its constituents, both flavonoid and non-flavonoid substances of propolis also showed anti-bacterial (Sabir, 2005, Sabir, 2010) and anti-inflammatory activities (Sabir et al, 2005). The chemical composition of propolis is very complex, depends on the collecting location, time, and plant source (Toreti et al, 2013). Commonly, the composition of propolis primarily consists of resinous (50 %), wax (30 %), essential and aromatics oils (10 %), bee pollen (5 %), and other substances (5 %) (Huang et al, 2014). Recently, propolis, an adhesive substance produced by honeybees has been drawn much attention due to its anti-inflammatory property.

40|$|The {{decision}} in Johnson v. Lake Drunmond Canal and Water Company (I 919. Va.) 99 S. E. 771, seems both unjust and unnecessary. It appears that in 1787 the Virginia legislature incorporated a canal company {{to erect a}} canal which should 2 ̆ 2 forever after 2 ̆ 2 be a public highway, free for transportation of goods and for travel on payment of the tolls imposed by the act of incorporation. In 1839 another act was passed authorizing the same company to construct an outlet from its canal to the Elizabeth river and granting it the power of eminent domain, provided, however, that the proprietors of abutting land should have free passage through the outlet. Prior {{to the construction of}} the outlet these lands either bordered on or were intersected by navigable creeks or streams reaching deep water and thus giving deep water access. The building of the outlet or canal completely destroyed these creeks or streams and the proviso of the Act of 1839 was inserted in order to give abutting proprietors deep water access through the canal in place of the access which was being destroyed. Soon thereafter the outlet was completed and the privilege of passage has been used by abutting proprietors, deep water access adding greatly to the value of the lands. In 1851 a railroad was given permission by the legislature to erect drawbridges across the outlet, but so as not to hinder, obstruct or delay passage of any craft on the canal; and if any such inconvenience resulted from the construction of the road, it was to be declared a nuisance and abated by the circuit court. In 1916 the latter portion of this Act was repealed and defendant canal company, who had succeeded the original canal company, was authorized by the legislature to abandon maintenance and operation of this portion of the canal or of so much of it as it deemed desirable.

40|$|Background: Propolis is {{a natural}} product of plant resins {{collected}} by honeybees from various plant sources. It {{is used as a}} remedy in folk medicine since ancient times because of its several biological and pharmacological properties. Recently, propolis has been used by dentist to treat various oral diseases. It was always mentioned as an anti-inflammatory agent. Cytokines are proteins that provide communication between cells and {{play a critical role in}} a wide variety of processes. It released from cells in an inflammatory process that active, mediate or potential actions of other cells or tissues. When dental pulp has inflammation, several pro-inflammatory cytokines including Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) was released by innate immune cells. Objective: To analyse the expression of IL- 6 on inflamed rat dental pulp tissue following application of propolis. Material and methods: Trigona sp. propolis was obtained from Luwu Regency, south Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Flavonoid and non-flavonoid extracts were purified from propolis using thin layer chromatography. The study was applied on 80 male Sprague Dawley rats, 10 – 12  weeks of age, divided randomly and equally into 5 groups. Group I, as negative control group was not conducted any treatment. At group II, III, IV and V. A Class I cavity (Black Classification) were made on the occlusal surface of right maxillary first molar. The dental pulp was perforated using dental explorer and allowed in the oral environment for 1  h, after that, Ethanolic Extract Propolis (EEP) (Group II), Extract Flavonoid-Propolis (EFP) (Group III), Extract Non-Flavonoid Propolis (ENFP) (Group IV), or Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) (Group V) were applied on dental pulp. All cavities were then filled with Glass Ionomer Cement as <b>permanent</b> <b>filling.</b> The rats being sacrificed in 6  h, 2  days, 4  days and 7  days. Sample biopsy were obtained, IL- 6 expression was detected by using immunohistochemistry method. Data was analyzed statistically using Freidman and Kruskal Wallis tests with significance level of P <  0. 05. Results: All agent showed IL- 6 expression in inflamed rat dental pulp tissue, and this expression was decreased with the longer of observation time periods. EEP more stronger to decreased IL- 6 expression on inflamed rat dental pulp tissue than other agent. There is significant difference (P <  0. 05) of IL- 6 expression between group I and other groups in 6  h and 2  days but not in 4 and 7  days time periods. Conclusion: Trigona sp. propolis from south Sulawesi, Indonesia could suppressed the expression of IL- 6 on inflamed rat dental pulp tissue...|$|E

It moved it into a new camp at Murfreesboro, Camp Garesché, named for Rosecrans' chief of staff killed at Stones River, where Palmer assembled his command and promised it a complete reorganization {{by the end of}} the month. Nine of the 12 company officers originally appointed by Rosecrans resigned February 27 and were not re-appointed. The regiment was expanded to 12 companies with the old companies broken up and the men redistributed.

Striking differences were observed. A 44 % reduction in decayed, missing, and filled deciduous teeth was found in 4 - 5 year-olds in the fluoridated compared with the non-fluoridated town and a 50 % reduction in decayed, missing, and <b>filled</b> <b>permanent</b> teeth was recorded for the 9 - 10 -year-olds. Larger percentage differences were found for the anterior teeth: a 65 % reduction in deciduous incisors and canines, and an 81 % reduction in permanent incisors and canines. Fluoridation of public water supplies in urban areas of Scotland would be a safe and effective way of dramatically improving dental health...|$|R
