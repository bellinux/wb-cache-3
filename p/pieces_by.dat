2500|$|<b>Piece</b> <b>by</b> <b>Piece</b> is {{illustrated}} {{as a concept}} record telling a single story, using themes of heartbreak, personal struggles, peace, and empowerment. The music of <b>Piece</b> <b>by</b> <b>Piece</b> consists of electropop, orchestral pop, power pop and electronic dance music, marking {{a departure from the}} predominant pop rock sound of her previous studio albums. <b>Piece</b> <b>by</b> <b>Piece</b> was released to positive reception from music critics, who applauded Clarkson's vocal performances. Criticism mainly targeted the album's production, as well as its belaboring on midtempo arrangements. <b>Piece</b> <b>by</b> <b>Piece</b> gave Clarkson a total of three Grammy Award nominations.

5|$|On the Confederate {{right flank}} {{a total of}} six {{batteries}} engaged the Federals, but they did so one-by-one instead of in unison, and each was consecutively cut to <b>pieces</b> <b>by</b> concentrated Union artillery fire. Moreover, they engaged the Union artillery later than the guns of the left flank, so the desired crossfire bombardment was never achieved.|$|E
5|$|Other notable piano <b>pieces</b> <b>by</b> Mendelssohn {{include his}} Variations sérieuses, Op. 54 (1841), the Rondo Capriccioso, {{the set of}} six Preludes and Fugues, Op. 35 (written between 1832 and 1837), and the Seven Characteristic Pieces, Op. 7 (1827).|$|E

5|$|Although rather solitary and introspective by nature, Elgar {{thrived in}} Worcester's musical circles. He {{played in the}} violins at the Worcester and Birmingham Festivals, and one great {{experience}} was to play Dvořák's Symphony No. 6 and Stabat Mater under the composer's baton. Elgar regularly played the bassoon in a wind quintet, alongside his brother Frank, an oboist (and conductor who ran his own wind band). Elgar arranged numerous <b>pieces</b> <b>by</b> Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and others for the quintet, honing his arranging and compositional skills.|$|E

Mercer was also a keen amateur painter himself and was also an excellent sportsman who represented Canada and the Canadian Army in shooting contests both at home and in Britain.|$|E

Tzara chaired the Committee for the Liberation of Nazım Hikmet, which issued petitions to national governments and commissioned works in honor of Hikmet (including musical <b>pieces</b> <b>by</b> Louis Durey and Serge Nigg). Hikmet was eventually released in July 1950, and publicly thanked Tzara during his subsequent visit to Paris.|$|E

5|$|Noted for {{publishing}} the biting satirical pieces and art chronicles of Tudor Arghezi, Seara was {{closely associated with}} the Romanian Symbolist movement. Through Arghezi, Bogdan-Pitești and other contributors, it campaigned in favor Symbolism and, after 1913, popularized modern art. Although paying tribute to political conservatism throughout its existence, Seara was also home to anti-establishment contributors, allies in the anti-Entente cause. The newspaper sympathized with the Social Democratic Party, regularly hosting opinion <b>pieces</b> <b>by</b> socialists and anarchists.|$|E

5|$|Singers {{and players}} admired Britten's conducting, and David Webster rated it highly enough {{to offer him}} the musical {{directorship}} of the Covent Garden Opera in 1952. Britten declined; he was not confident of his ability as a conductor and was reluctant to {{spend too much time}} performing rather than composing. As a conductor, Britten's repertory included Purcell, Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Schubert, and occasional less characteristic choices including Schumann's Scenes from Goethe's Faust; Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius and Introduction and Allegro; Holst's Egdon Heath and short <b>pieces</b> <b>by</b> Percy Grainger.|$|E
5|$|Ten objects, {{among them}} {{one of the}} inscribed rings, were stolen shortly after the find was made, and when the {{remaining}} objects were recovered, {{it was discovered that}} the other ring had been cut into at least four <b>pieces</b> <b>by</b> a Bucharest goldsmith, whereby one of the inscribed characters had become damaged to the point of illegibility. Fortunately, detailed drawings, a cast, and a photograph made by London's Arundel Society of the ring before it was damaged survive, {{and the nature of the}} lost character can be established with relative certainty.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} and artistic exhibits include a 15th-century ring, a 16th-century cross, and amber jewelry {{from the past}} four centuries, {{as well as a}} number of rosaries, cigarette holders, and decorative boxes. The missing amber artifacts that were dated to the Neolithic era have been reconstructed by archeologists. Selections of modern amber work are part of the collection, including <b>pieces</b> <b>by</b> the Lithuanian artists Horstas Taleikis, Dionyzas Varkalis, Jonas Urbonas, and others.|$|E

5|$|The lack {{of flight}} {{recorder}} {{data for the}} last six minutes of the flight added significant complexity to the investigation and was a major factor in its lengthy duration. The Transportation Safety Board team had to reconstruct the last six minutes of flight entirely from the physical evidence. As the aircraft was broken into 2 million <b>pieces</b> <b>by</b> the impact, this process was time-consuming and tedious. The investigation became the largest and most expensive transport accident investigation in Canadian history, costing C$57 million (US$48.5 million) over five years.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetry}} {{on earth}} mirrors the symmetric perfection of heaven. The purpose {{of art at}} this time—in architecture, the visual arts, and music—was not to create something entirely new, but to reflect this divine perfection, {{and in this way}} to praise God. We find such a symmetric outline in many <b>pieces</b> <b>by</b> Johann Sebastian Bach,19 but only in a few cases is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass. The parts Kyrie, Gloria and Credo are all designed with choral sections as the outer movements, framing an intimate center of theological significance.|$|E
