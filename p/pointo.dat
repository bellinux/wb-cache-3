The game was released exclusively in Japan on April 26, 1991. The title of the game references Lagrangian points, the five positions in space where a body of negligible mass could be placed which would then maintain its position relative to two existing massive bodies.|$|E

40|$|With {{advance in}} {{technology}} {{access to data}} especially 3 D point cloud data {{becomes more and more}} an everyday task. 3 D point clouds are usually captured with very expensive tools such as 3 D laser scanners or very time consuming methods such as photogrammetry. Most of the available softwares for 3 D point cloud processing are designed for experts and specialists in this field and are usually very large software packages containing variety of methods and tools. This results in softwares that are usually very expensive to acquire and also very difficult to use. Difficulty of use is caused by complicated user interfaces that is required to accommodate a large list of features. The aim of these complex softwares is to provide a powerful tool for a specific group of specialist. However they are not necessary required by the majority of the up coming average users of point clouds. In addition to complexity and high costs of these softwares they generally rely on expensive and modern hardware and only compatible with one specific operating system. Many point cloud customers are not point cloud processing experts or willing to spend the high acquisition costs of these expensive softwares and hardwares. In this paper we introduce a solution for low cost point cloud processing. Our approach is designed to accommodate the needs of the average point cloud user. To reduce the cost and complexity of software our approach focuses on one functionality at a time in contrast with most available softwares and tools that aim to solve as many problems as possible at the same time. Our simple and user oriented design improve the user experience and empower us to optimize our methods for creation of an efficient software. In this paper we introduce <b>Pointo</b> family as a series of connected softwares to provide easy to use tools with simple design for different point cloud processing requirements. PointoVIEWER and PointoCAD are introduced as the first components of the <b>Pointo</b> family to provide a fast and efficient visualization with the ability to add annotation and documentation to the point clouds...|$|E

Sports Physiol., Vol. 6, No. 1 pp 17 - 23, 2000. We {{evaluated}} {{changes in}} alveolar ventilation (VA) and dead-space ventilation (VD) in 11 patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and 6 control subjects during an ergometer exercise test. We also investigated {{the relations between}} these parameters and the lactate and respiratory compensation thresholds (LT. RCT). Respiratory gases were monitored during the exercise and blood samples were obtained at 1 -minute intervals for determinations of lactate and PaCO 2 levels. VA {{was determined by the}} modified alveolar gas equation. VA increased in a biphasic manner in relation to the increase in oxygen uptake (VO 2), and Vo 2 at the deflection point of the radio of VA to VO 2 was highly correlated with the LT(r= 0. 92). VD also increased in a biphasic manner in relation to the increase in VOs+ and VO 2 at the deflection point of the ratio of VD to VOs was correlated with VOw at the RCT (r= 0. 99). The slope of VD-VO 2 relation above the RCT point was gerater in patients with MI and it was inversely related to peak VO 2. Thus, the biphasic VA-VO 2 relation was related to lactate production of exercising muscle, while the biphasic VD-VO 2 relation was related to hyperventilation both in patients with MI and control subjects, and the enhanced response of VD above the RCT <b>pointo</b> in patients with MI was associated with lowered exercise tolerance and might be explained by hyperventilation and lower lung perfusion...|$|E
