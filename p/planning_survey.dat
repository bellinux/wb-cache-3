5000|$|In 1988 {{management}} of the hospital was officially transferred from the directors to a board of provincially appointed trustees. [...] The shift was an anticipated one, as the Report of the Mental Health <b>Planning</b> <b>Survey</b> of 1979 states: “What began as the sensible idea of using non-medical, trained administers for administrative tasks, has subtly become the use of untrained non-medical administrators, and a simultaneous denial of the psychiatrist's role in clinical leadership." [...] The shift had been happening from the early 1960s and has been argued {{to be one of}} the reasons for the 1969 committee's decision to downsize Riverview and decrease funding. The board, as far less experienced in psychiatry than the original managers who held doctorates and who were trained psychiatrists, were again replaced in 1992 by another board without trustees that was said to give a broader representation of concerns including those of consumers patients, businesses, and union and community agencies.|$|E

40|$|The {{annihilation}} {{of dark matter}} particles is expected to yield a broad radiation spectrum via the production of Standard Model particles in astrophysical environments. In particular, electrons and positrons from dark matter annihilation produce synchrotron radiation {{in the presence of}} magnetic fields. Galaxy clusters are the most massive collapsed structures in the universe, and are known to host ∼μG-scale magnetic fields. They are therefore ideal targets to search for, or to constrain the synchrotron signal from dark matter annihilation. In this work we use the expected sensitivities of several <b>planned</b> <b>surveys</b> from the next generation of radio telescopes to predict the constraints on dark matter annihilation models which will be achieved in the case of non-detections of diffuse radio emission from galaxy clusters. Specifically, we consider the Tier 1 <b>survey</b> <b>planned</b> for the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) at 120 MHz, the EMU <b>survey</b> <b>planned</b> for the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) at 1. 4 GHz, and <b>planned</b> <b>surveys</b> for APERTIF at 1. 4 GHz. We find that, for massive clusters and dark matter masses ≲ 100 GeV, the predicted limits on the annihilation cross section would rule out vanilla thermal relic models for even the shallow LOFAR Tier 1, ASKAP, and APERTIF surveys.
