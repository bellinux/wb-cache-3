The winning devices must {{also be able to}} continuously record and stream the 5 main vital signs: Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Oxygen Saturation, Respiratory Rate and Temperature.

Devices were sent to the University of California San Diego to be independently tested on patients during the winter and spring of 2015, and again in late 2016 at the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute (ACTRI) at UCSD. Although no team successfully met all the requirements of the grand prize, the competition was concluded in April 2017 when the XPRIZE Foundation awarded reduced prizes to the strongest performing teams. Most notably, Final Frontier Medical Devices was awarded US$2.6 million and Dynamical Biomarkers won US$1 million. A third team, Cloud DX, was named [...] "Bold Epic Innovator" [...] and awarded US$100,000 for achieving the main milestones of the competition while missing a crucial deadline. Earlier in 2016, some of the funds from the original prize purse were awarded to semi-finalist teams for hitting technology milestones.

40|$|BNFL Instruments ' TRU-D <b>Portable</b> <b>Package</b> monitor (PPM) was {{developed}} {{in response to a}} market need for a simple, highly maneuverable, accurate, reliable and inexpensive packet monitor. The instrument plays a major role at nuclear sites in performing a wide variety of plutonium measurement tasks, but is primarily being used as a portable instrument for criticality safety measurements of the fissile content of waste packages at the point of origin. Traditional packet monitoring methods used in operations and decommissioning have relied on methods such as gross gamma counting, which are subject to considerable variation, due to differences in the attenuation properties of waste matrix and source. The TRU-D <b>Portable</b> <b>Package</b> Monitor uses the total neutron counting method, which is far less sensitive to such biases. The system has been designed for rapid set-up and simple push button operation and can accept packages up to 30 cm in diameter and 50 cm in length with a maximum weight of 25 kg. The minimum detectable activity (MDA) is of the order of 0. 1 - 1 g Pu for a 10 minute measurement. Total measurement uncertainty (TMU) is typically less than +/- 40 % at the 95 % confidence level. Three applications are described in this paper, which demonstrate the versatility of this instrument. At nuclear sites in the United Kingdom, more than a dozen PPMs have been deployed in various waste management applications including provision of a “Threshold ” indication of Pu content for criticality safety control. In the USA at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS) a PPM is in use, also for criticality safety controls, for cumulative waste container loading estimates. The qualification work at RFETS established a PPM upper range limit of 500 g for Weapons Grade (WG) Pu Oxide. In th...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Real-time {{tele-immersion}} requires {{low latency}} and synchronized multi-camera capture. Prior high definition (HD) capture systems were bulky. We investigate {{the suitability of}} using flocks of smartphone cameras for tele-immersion. Smartphones integrate capture and streaming into a single <b>portable</b> <b>package.</b> However, they archive the captured video into a movie. Hence, we create a sequence of H. 264 movies and stream them. Capture delay is reduced by minimizing the number of frames in each movie segment. However, fewer frames reduces compression efficiency. Also, smartphone video encoders do not sacrifice video quality to lower the compression latency or the stream size. On an iPhone 4 S, our application that uses published APIs streams 1920 x 1080 videos at 16. 5 fps with a delay of 712 ms between a real-life event and displaying an uncompressed bitmap of this event on a local laptop.

In this paper we describe the architecture of the system and test its performances using both small earthquakes (M< 3) recorded at the ISNet, and a large event recorded in Japan, through a simulation mode. The results show that, when a dense seismic network is deployed in the fault area, PRESTo can produce reliable estimates of earthquake location and size within 5 - 6 seconds from the event origin. Each estimate is provided as a probability density function, with an uncertainty that typically decreases with time: a stable solution is generally reached within 10 seconds from the origin. Thanks to its fully probabilistic approach, PRESTo can be a powerful tool for end-users in addressing the trade-off problem of whether and when to init safety measures. The software makes use of widespread standards for real-time data input and output, and can be finely tuned to easily adapt it to different networks and seismogenic regions...|$|E

40|$|Portable and point-of-care biosensors {{are highly}} {{desirable}} in multiple fields including medical diagnosis, environmental monitoring and food quality control. Such systems {{need to be}} sensitive, robust, compact and user-friendly. Diffractometry has been demonstrated to possess these characteristics and has been used extensively in many different forms/versions that range from waveguides to particle-based self-assembled diffraction gratings. Diffraction measurements are usually performed in specifically-built optical setups that are relatively large, intricate and therefore immobile due to the requirement of multiple pieces of equipment (optical components, microscopes and computers). This not only introduces difficulties due to multiple alignment steps but also makes the system virtually impossible to use by an unskilled person. This {{is one reason why}} most biosensing schemes developed in academia do not leave the developers 2 ̆ 7 laboratory. A <b>portable</b> <b>package</b> that enables multiple modalities of optical analysis (including diffraction measurements and regular brightfield microscopy) with 2 ̆ 2 all 2 ̆ 2 of the computational and electronic peripherals built-in, would be extremely useful. ^ This dissertation reports on the development of an all-in-one portable system that serves as an advanced multi-modal imaging and analysis tool. This system performs imaging and diffraction measurements coincidently (on the same interrogation spot) by two illumination sources - white light and coherent light (diode laser) - arranged in an in-line format. The package accommodates all of the necessary optical components, such as lenses and beam-splitters, printed circuit boards and electronic components, a touch-screen display and an on-board computer that can be programmed to execute specific imaging tasks. The package is highly portable, versatile and measures only 21. 5 x 13. 5 x 14 cm^ 3. ^ We demonstrate the design and application of the portable system in the context of bead-based diffraction gratings where the grating is formed by self-assembly of microspheres or 2 ̆ 2 beads 2 ̆ 2 mediated by biomolecular recognition. In this scheme, molecule-coupled beads selectively bind to a microcontact 2 ̆ 2 printed 2 ̆ 2 template pattern that is composed of alternating lines. The binding of the beads forms a diffraction grating which produces a specific diffraction pattern when illuminated with a coherent light source. At the same time the chip surface needs to be interrogated using brightfield microscopy. For this purpose bead counting and diffraction measurement programs were developed and used with the images acquired by the system. Numerical simulations of the bead-based gratings are also performed to understand the underlying mechanism of diffraction. The measurements agree with the simulation predictions as well as demonstrate the unique capability of the device to perform imaging and diffractometry at the same spot on the chip. The unique design of the <b>portable</b> <b>package</b> and the analysis software not only significantly reduce the entire process of optical chip analysis to a few simple steps but also completely isolate the user from the underlying complexity of an engineering system. ...|$|E
