40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>toxins,</b> {{secondary}} metabolites {{that are}} not essential {{for the survival of}} the organism itself but are toxic to human health, are produced by many <b>plants.</b> <b>Plant</b> <b>toxins</b> can be present as inherent metabolites in daily foods such as potatoes, herbs and spices or in herbal preparations. <b>Plant</b> <b>toxins</b> can be present as contaminants in foods as a result of unintentionally co-harvested weeds, transfer from feed to products of animal origin, or as residue after application of <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> as natural pesticides. Incidents with <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> are reported in Europe, mainly as a result of mixing-up of plant species used in herbal remedies or similarities between edible crops and certain weeds. EU legislation on <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> in food, if existing at all, is scattered over different legal acts, such as acts on contaminants, flavourings and residues. Limits for <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> are, furthermore, mentioned in product specifications of approved novel foods and thus related to one specific plant product. It was concluded {{that there is a need}} for a more coherent legislation on <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> in food in the EU to ensure consumer health. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>toxins</b> are {{substances}} {{produced and}} secreted by plants {{to defend themselves}} against predators. In a broad sense, this includes all substances that have a toxic effect on targeted organisms, whether they are microbes, other plants, insects, or higher animals. <b>Plant</b> <b>toxins</b> have a diverse range of structures, from small organic molecules through to proteins. This review gives {{an overview of the}} various classes of <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> but focuses on an interesting class of protein-based <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> containing a cystine knot motif. This structural motif confers exceptional stability on proteins containing it and is associated {{with a wide range of}} biological activities. The biological activities and structural stability offer many potential applications in the pharmaceutical and agricultural fields.

5000|$|Cercospora melongenae overwinters in soil {{or plant}} debris as conidiophores which then can be {{dispersed}} {{to the plant}} by rain splash, irrigation water, wind or mechanical transport. The innoculum, conidia, enter through the stomata of the leaves where they germinate and produce more conidia on conidiophores. The conidia must have water or moisture {{in the form of}} heavy dew in order to germinate and therefore penetrate the leaf via. the stomata or other natural openings or wounds on the plant. Fungi in the genus Cercospora produce the <b>plant</b> <b>toxin</b> cercosporin, which causes the leaf spot appearance. Cercosporin is a photosensitizing perylenequione <b>plant</b> <b>toxin</b> that absorbs light energy and converts it into a highly activated state. This activated state then reacts with molecular oxygen to form activated oxygen, which in turn reacts with proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids causing damage or cell death.The fungal spores are not harmed by the production of this toxin because they produce pyridoxine which neutralizes the reaction. [...] While the toxin damages the host cells, conidia is produced and is able to infect the current host or spread to other susceptible hosts in the area.|$|E

5000|$|Poisonous animals, {{mushrooms}} and plants again cover {{a diversity of}} taxonomic groups. In many cases, poisonous animals derive their poison from the environment. This applies to classic marine poisons such as fugu (tetrodotoxin), ciguatera, and the several distinct types of shellfish poisons. In many cases the prime toxin producer is a dinoflagellate. Conversely, mushroom and <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> are produced by the organism itself. <b>Plant</b> <b>toxins</b> have long been recognised as poisons, but also as therapeutic agents, if used in the correct dose. A classic example is digitalis, long used as treatment for certain heart conditions. Nevertheless, some <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> have become [...] "popular" [...] as self-harm agents, used in suicides. Mushroom toxins include some lethal toxins that can cause painful, drawn out death.|$|R
5000|$|Research on herbivores {{supports}} {{the notion of}} a regulation pathway. <b>Plant</b> <b>toxin</b> concentration informs mammalian herbivore food choices, with herbivores moderating toxicity by capping daily plant intake to accommodate blood toxin concentrations. This mechanism exists across herbivore species and remains static in response to a range of plant toxins, even those that are evolutionarily novel. [...] Similarly, in laboratory conditions, mice have been shown to moderate administration of drugs regardless of dose per injection or the number of lever presses required.|$|E
50|$|The neurotoxin {{regulation}} hypothesis {{emphasizes the}} evolutionary biology of plant-human coevolution and maintains that secondary plant metabolites, including alkaloids like nicotine, morphine, and cocaine, are potent neurotoxins that evolved to deter and punish herbivore {{consumption of the}} plant soma not encourage/reward it. Researchers highlight that it is evolutionarily disadvantageous for plants to produce toxins that plant predators (e.g. humans) are attracted to, and that it runs contrary to evolutionary logic that plant predators (e.g. humans) would evolve neurobiological systems unprotected from <b>plant</b> <b>toxin</b> consumption.|$|E

50|$|Though the {{long-term}} health costs {{of drug use}} use are undeniable, proponents of the medicinal model of drug use suggest {{it is possible that}} regulated consumption of plant neurotoxins was selected for. In this regard, researchers have argued that the human brain evolved to control and regulate intake of psychoactive <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> in order to promote reproductive fitness. Broadly, theorists suggest that <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> were deliberately ingested by human ancestors to combat macroparasites (e.g. parasitic worms) and/or to ward off disease carrying vectors (e.g. mosquitos).|$|R

50|$|One {{reason for}} the {{pathogenic}} success of Cercospora zeae-maydis is {{the production of a}} <b>plant</b> <b>toxin</b> called cercosporin. All members of the Cercospora genus produce this light-activated toxin during infection. In the absence of light, cercosporin is inactive, but when light is present, the toxin is converted into its excited triplet state. Activated cercosporin reacts with oxygen molecules, generating active single oxygen radicals. Oxygen radicals react with plant cell lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, damaging and killing affected cells, and nutrients released during the cell rupture and death feed the Cercospora fungus. A study of mutant Cercospora lacking the gene responsible for cercosporin production demonstrates that, though unnecessary for infection, cercosporin increases the virulence of Cercospora fungi.|$|E
50|$|A {{subset of}} L-α-amino acids are {{ambiguous}} {{as to which}} of two ends is the α-carbon. In proteins a cysteine residue can form a disulfide bond with another cysteine residue, thus crosslinking the protein. Two crosslinked cysteines form a cystine molecule.Cysteine and methionine are generally produced by direct sulfurylation, but in some species they can be produced by transsulfuration, where the activated homoserine or serine is fused to a cysteine or homocysteine forming cystathionine.A similar compound is lanthionine, which {{can be seen as}} two alanine molecules joined via a thioether bond and is found in various organisms.Similarly, djenkolic acid, a <b>plant</b> <b>toxin</b> from jengkol beans, is composed of two cysteines connected by a methylene group.Diaminopimelic acid is both used as a bridge in petidoglycan and is used a precursor to lysine (via its decarboxylation).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Earlier {{models of}} plant-herbivore {{interactions}} relied on forms of functional response that related rates of ingestion by herbivores to mechanical or physical attributes such as bite size and rate. These models fail to predict {{a growing number}} of findings that implicate chemical toxins as important determinants of plant-herbivore dynamics. Specifically, considerable evidence suggests that toxins set upper limits on food intake for many species of herbivorous vertebrates. Herbivores feeding on toxin-containing plants must avoid saturating their detoxification systems, which often occurs before ingestion rates are limited by mechanical handling of food items. In light of the importance of <b>plant</b> <b>toxins,</b> a new approach is needed to link herbivores to their food base. We discuss necessary features of such an approach, note recent advances in herbivore functional response models that incorporate effects of <b>plant</b> <b>toxins,</b> and mention predictions that are consistent with observations in natural systems. Future ecological studies will need to address explicitly the importance of <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> in shaping <b>plant</b> and herbivore communities. </p...|$|R
50|$|As well as {{genes that}} produce toxins, other genes have been {{identified}} which help S. scabies to infect plants. A tomatinase enzyme, encoded by tomA which can degrade the antimicrobial saponin α-tomatine. The aerial growth of mutants lacking the gene is inhibited, but the mycelium is {{able to continue to}} grow. Nec1 is another protein that is required for virulence, which is secreted out of the bacteria. It is not clear how it leads to disease, but it may suppress the defense mechanisms that thaxtomin activates. Another gene cluster in the 87.22 strain is very similar to a cluster found in the Gram negative plant pathogens Pseudomonas syringae and Pectobacterium atrosepticum. The cluster produces coronafacic acid, part of the <b>plant</b> <b>toxin</b> coronatine which mimics the plant hormone jasmonate, contributing to virulence.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} toxins varies widely from plant to plant. As {{much as a}} 5:1 {{variation}} can be found between plants, and a given plant's toxicity depends on its age, where it is growing, and the local weather conditions. Additionally, within a given datura <b>plant,</b> <b>toxin</b> concentration varies by part and even from leaf to leaf. When the plant is younger, the ratio of scopolamine to atropine is about 3:1; after flowering, this ratio is reversed, {{with the amount of}} scopolamine continuing to decrease as the plant gets older. In traditional cultures, a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of Datura was critical to minimize harm. An individual datura seed contains about 0.1 mg of atropine, and the approximate fatal dose for adult humans is >10 mg atropine or >2-4 mg scopolamine.|$|E
50|$|Human {{and plant}} neurotoxin {{coevolution}} {{is evidenced by}} features of the xenobiotic defense network. Tobacco activates defense mechanisms which researchers suggests it is recognized as toxic not a reward. Nicotine activates bitter taste receptors in the mouth and gut. Ingesting 4-8 mg of nicotine causes burning of the mouth and throat, nausea, aversion, vomiting and diarrhea. In higher doses the effects are more robust and can result in weakness, confusion, dizziness, convulsions, and coma. If consumed in high enough amounts, acute nicotine toxicity can trigger failure of the respiratory system and induce death in human adults within minutes. First-time users of tobacco especially report a variety of unpleasant effects upon administration of nicotine, including nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal distress, headache, and sweating. This, when taken {{with the fact that}} nicotine is a <b>plant</b> <b>toxin</b> that evolved to deter herbivores, suggests instead that the human body naturally recognizes tobacco as a toxic substance, and not a reward.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Surgeons may {{be unaware}} of the ability of <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> to cause corneal damage. Therefore, corneal damage {{following}} intraocular surgery due to <b>plant</b> <b>toxins</b> may be misdiagnosed as postoperative infection. Case presentation A 74 -year-old man presented with hyperemia and reduced visual acuity in both eyes 60 weeks after uneventful cataract surgery. We observed extensive hyperemia and corneal stromal edema with Descemet 2 ̆ 019 s folds in both eyes. After obtaining a detailed patient history, we diagnosed plant toxin-induced corneal edema due to Asclepias physocarpa, which can induce corneal edema by inhibiting the Na + /K + ATPase activity of the corneal endothelium. Antimicrobial and steroid eye drops and an oral steroid were prescribed accordingly. Symptons began to improve on day 3 and had almost completely resolved by day 6. At 10 month, the patient had fully recovered without any sequelae. Conclusion The correct diagnosis was possible {{in the present case}} as symptoms were bilateral and the patient was able to report his potential exposure to <b>plant</b> <b>toxins.</b> However, if the symptoms had been unilateral and the patient had been unaware of these toxins, he may have undergone unnecessary surgical interventions to treat non-existent postoperative endophthalmitis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of <b>plant</b> <b>toxin</b> ricin and MLI binding subunits to liposomes containing monosialoganglioside (GM 1), bearing a terminal galactose residue, has been examined {{as a possible}} receptor model. For {{the first time we}} demonstrate that ricin B-chain but not ricin provokes liposome aggregation at 10 M% GM 1 concentration, whereas in the presence of either ricin A-chain or galactose the aggregation is inhibited. The B-subunit of <b>plant</b> <b>toxin</b> MLI from Viscum album has similar lectin specificity and activity but cannot aggregate GM 1 liposomes. The ability of the B-chain to aggregate liposomes adds a new crucial step in the toxin transmembrane penetration mechanism. We demonstrate here possible ricin B-chain interactions with membranes proceeding via two sites, namely (a) a galactose-binding domain and (b) a hydrophobic interchain domain. In close contact with two phospholipid bilayers, ricin B-chain may determine the geometry of the fusion site. These events can provoke A-chain translocation which follows membrane fusion...|$|E
