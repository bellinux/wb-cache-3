40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} ethical dilemmas and ethical difficulties experienced by <b>psychologists</b> <b>in</b> Sweden and South Africa. The study is a replication of previous studies conducted by Colnerud (1997) and Slack and Wassenaar (1999). A sample of 295 <b>psychologists</b> <b>in</b> Sweden and 312 <b>psychologists</b> <b>in</b> South Africa were asked to describe situations that they identified as ethically difficult. 53 <b>psychologists</b> <b>in</b> Sweden described 61 incidents and 21 <b>psychologists</b> <b>in</b> South Africa described 24 situations. This corresponds to a response rate of 20 % in Sweden and 8 % in South Africa. The reported dilemmas were categorized according to a qualitative content analysis developed by Pope and Vetter (1992). The contribution of this study is that the results confirm that confidentiality is a prominent ethical dilemma for <b>psychologists</b> <b>in</b> Sweden and South Africa. This finding is consistent with findings in comprehensive international research. Furthermore, the results indicate that <b>psychologists,</b> especially <b>in</b> Sweden, experience ethical problems due to weakened legitimacy when conducting assessments. The results are discussed taking into consideration the different contexts <b>in</b> which <b>psychologists</b> work, the application of different ethics codes and different levels of ethical awareness. The weaknesses of the study and the method used are also discussed...|$|R
