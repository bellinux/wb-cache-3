40|$|Lathyrus cicera L. is {{presented}} as a new record for the Flora of India. The new record is based on the specimens collected from the adjoining area of Tikri, a village of district Udhampur of Jammu and Kashmir State. Morphological description of the species and flowering and fruiting periods and ecological notes are presented here along with the illustrations of vegetative and floral parts and a scanned copy of Herbarium sheet of the species. The species is distinguished from other allied species on the basis of morphological characters of leaves, peduncle 1 - 3 cm long articulated near to the middle or towards apex, red flowers, <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>markings</b> on the surface of pods and dark brown to black seed...|$|E
500|$|The <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> bold <b>markings</b> {{does not}} in itself prove that an animal relies on camouflage.

40|$|Pavement markings, {{as a form}} {{of traffic}} control devices, {{play a crucial role in}} safely guiding drivers. Restriping {{pavement}} markings is an important task in the maintenance of traffic control devices. Every year state agencies spend a lot of money in maintaining pavement markings as the retroreflectivity or durability values <b>of</b> the <b>markings</b> fall below a minimum level. Currently, the most widely adopted method used to determine the <b>presence</b> conditions <b>of</b> pavement <b>markings</b> is by expert observation, a subjective technique that may not provide consistent and convinced results for agencies. Hence, a fast and accurate way to determine the <b>presence</b> conditions <b>of</b> pavement <b>markings</b> can lead to significant cost savings while ensuring driving safety. In this study, a systematic approach that can automatically determine the <b>presence</b> conditions <b>of</b> pavement <b>markings</b> using digital image processing techniques is presented. These techniques are used to correct the geometric deformity, detect colors <b>of</b> pavement <b>markings,</b> segment images, enhance images, detect edge lines <b>of</b> ideal pavement <b>markings,</b> and recognize the features <b>of</b> pavement <b>markings</b> appearing in the photographs. To better implement the aforementioned techniques, a software package has been developed by Graphic User Interface (GUI) as a platform to simultaneously evaluate the <b>presence</b> conditions <b>of</b> single or multiple pavement markings. The developed software package is able to do operations such as open files, calibrate camera calibration, clip, rotation, histogram display, and detection of edge lines <b>of</b> ideal pavement <b>markings.</b> The above system was tested and evaluated with the photograph datasets provided by the NTPEP Mississippi test deck. The empirical results (when compared with the manual method and expert observation) show that the developed system in this study is accurate and reliable. Additionally, the interactivity of the developed software package is satisfactory due to the feedback from ten volunteers. It is also concluded that the developed system, as an important reference, potentially helps agencies make a better decision in the maintenance <b>of</b> pavement <b>markings</b> with more accurate and speedy evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>presence</b> conditions <b>of</b> pavement <b>markings...</b>|$|R

40|$|Non-nuclear {{methods for}} the {{measurement}} of hot-mix asphalt (HMA) density offer {{the ability to take}} numerous density readings in {{a very short period of}} time, without the need for intensive licensing, training, and maintenance efforts common to nuclear gauges.

In this project, a number of field sites were used to evaluate the non-nuclear gauges in terms of ruggedness, accuracy, and precision. A thorough investigation of calibration methods was also performed.

40|$|AbstractPrevious European research, i. e. COST 331 and the IMPROVER {{projects}} {{had demonstrated}} that road markings greatly increase driver comfort during dry night time conditions. Nevertheless, they highlighted {{the need for}} additional research under wet and wet and rainy conditions. Building upon this research, the RAINVISION project has investigated {{over the last three years}} how road markings can influence driver behaviour under all nightime weather conditions (dry, wet and wet and rainy) and how different age groups and gender groups adapt their behaviour based on the visibility and retro-reflectivity <b>of</b> road <b>markings.</b> The project has carried out three different trials; i. e. a simulation trial in France, a track test trial in Austria and on-road trial in the United Kingdom in cooperation with local authorities. For the simulation and track test trials, more than 100 test subjects were recruited respectively according to three age groups (20 – 40, 41 – 60 and 61 + years) and took several trials during different conditions. For the on-road trials, 10 high-risk sites were selected in cooperation with Durham county and Type II marking materials were applied in these sections. The project subsequently monitored speed over a whole climatic cycle and undertook an accidentology analysis. The results of the study in general indicate that the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> enhanced road <b>markings</b> did significantly increase driver comfort, especially for older drivers. While there was an increase in driver speed, it was not seen as safety hazard as it was compensated by greater preview times. In fact in the UK trials, the results show that the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> enhanced road <b>markings</b> actually led to a decrease in speeds...|$|R
50|$|Horses {{with both}} the {{champagne}} gene and the dun gene are also well-recorded. The dun gene is responsible for flat, diluted coat colors and vivid primitive markings. Bay dun {{is thought to be}} the wildtype horse coat color. Dun does not affect skin or eye color, but dilutes red pigment to yellow and black pigment to slate gray. Champagne horses with the dun gene will have slightly further-diluted coats compared to non-dun champagnes, and will always exhibit striking primitive markings, such as a dorsal stripe and zebra-like stripes on the legs. Naming schemes are much the same as with champagne-cream combinations. Champagne-dun combinations retain their champagne eye and skin traits. The coats are distinguishable from non-champagne duns in that they are several shades lighter, black pigment is chocolate rather than slate, and they may exhibit a sheen. The coats are distinguishable from non-dun champagnes in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> primitive <b>markings</b> and a flatter tone.|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{analyses}} of the eight volcanic eruption plumes detected on Io by Voyager 1 are presented. Plumes were observed on the bright and dark limbs of the satellite corresponding to half of the surface and range from 10, 000 to 75 km in width and 280 to 70 km in height. Most plumes were observed to be umbrella-shaped, however one consists of a very diffuse cloud lacking columnar fountain characteristics. Plume sources are characterized by a dark central area, surrounded by a bright ring, {{which in turn is}} surrounded by a broad, diffuse region; the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> similar <b>markings</b> in regions not observed at the limb indicates additional volcanic activity on Io. No changes were detected in the sizes or intensities of the eruptions over the 6. 5 -day viewing period, however a change in the appearance of a region near one plume suggests a short-lived eruption between observations. Seven of the eight plumes are located within 30 deg of the equator, implying that equatorial surfaces are generally younger than those in the polar regions...|$|R

40|$|Road {{markings}} contribute greatly towards improving {{road safety}} standards. For some time now, manufacturers, researchers and road management authorities {{have been interested}} in the development of high-performance products in terms of durability, night-time retroreflection, visibility in wet conditions and more recently, skid resistance. To meet these functional requisites, the latest generation of products for road markings often contain mixtures of glass beads and aggregates, of varying quantities and types, which in many cases involves an appreciable alteration of the skid resistance parameters of road pavements (MTD, PTV), due to the partial saturation of the road surface micro- and macro-texture. This paper reports the results of intensive road monitoring of products with drop on materials for road marking, during which the characteristic road texture parameters were measured and compared, of both asphalt pavement and markings, using the most common international indexes (SFC, SN, IFI) to obtain the specific skid resistance coefficients for each of them. Crossed comparison of the different parameters determined the effect of saturation of the road pavement surface texture caused by the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> road <b>markings</b> with drop on materials, and also evaluated the decline of performance in terms of skid resistance...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{structural}} characteristics and periodicities <b>of</b> regular incremental <b>markings</b> in sheep enamel using fluorochrome injections for vital labeling of forming enamel and backscattered electron imaging in the scanning electron microscope. Microscopic analysis of mandibular first molars revealed the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> incremental <b>markings</b> with a daily periodicity (laminations) that indicated successive {{positions of the}} forming front of interprismatic enamel. In addition to the laminations, incremental markings with a sub-daily periodicity were discernible both in interprismatic enamel and in enamel prisms. Five sub-daily increments were present between two consecutive laminations. Backscattered electron imaging revealed that each sub-daily growth increment consisted of a broader and more highly mineralized band and a narrower and less mineralized band (line). The sub-daily markings in the prisms of sheep enamel morphologically resembled the (daily) prisms cross striations seen in primate enamel. Incremental markings with a supra-daily periodicity were not observed in sheep enamel. Based on the periodicity <b>of</b> the incremental <b>markings,</b> maximum mean daily apposition rates of 17. 0 µm in buccal enamel and of 13. 4 µm in lingual enamel were recorded. Enamel extension rates were also high, with maximum means of 180 µm/day and 217 µm/day in upper crown areas of buccal and lingual enamel, respectively. Values in more cervical crown portions were markedly lower. Our results are in accordance with previous findings in other ungulate species. Using the incremental markings present in primate enamel as a reference {{could result in a}} misinterpretation <b>of</b> the incremental <b>markings</b> in ungulate enamel. Thus, the sub-daily growth increments in the prisms of ungulate enamel might be mistaken as prism cross striations with a daily periodicity, and the laminations misidentified as striae of Retzius with a supra-daily periodicity. This would lead to a considerable overestimation of crown formation times in ungulate teeth...|$|R
50|$|The {{lowland anoa}} (Bubalus depressicornis) {{is a small}} bovid, {{standing}} barely over 90 cm at the shoulder. They are also known as anoa de Ilanura or anoa des plaines. It is most closely allied to the larger Asiatic buffaloes, showing the same reversal of {{the direction of the}} hair on their backs. The horns are peculiar for their upright direction and comparative straightness, although they have the same triangular section as in other buffaloes. White spots are sometimes present below the eyes, and there may be white markings on the legs and back; the absence or <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> these white <b>markings</b> may be indicative of distinct races. The horns of the cows are very small. The nearest allies of the anoa appear to be certain extinct buffaloes, the remains of which are found in the Siwalik Hills of northern India.

5|$|The <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> bold skin <b>markings</b> {{does not}} in itself prove that an animal relies on camouflage, as that depends on its behaviour. For example, {{although}} giraffes have a high contrast pattern that could be disruptive coloration, the adults are extremely conspicuous when in the open. Some authors have argued that adult giraffes are cryptic, since when standing among trees and bushes they are hard to see at even a few metres' distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves, even from lions, rather than on camouflage. A different explanation is implied {{by the fact that}} young giraffes are far more vulnerable to predation than adults: {{more than half of all}} giraffe calves die within a year, and giraffe mothers hide their calves, which spend much of the time lying down in cover while their mothers are away feeding. Since the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a mother nearby does not affect survival, it is argued that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged; this is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited.|$|R

For this, {{the first part of}} the paper analyzes the projective properties of two common generic shapes, planar right constant generalized cylinders (PRCGCs) and circular planar right generalized cylinders (circular PRGCs). The properties we analyze include new geometric invariant and quasi-invariant properties of the orthographic projection of the above shapes and a useful classification of their structural properties as functions of their pose. The second part of the paper describes an implemented system which detects and recovers PRCGCs and circular PRGCs from an intensity image in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> noise, surface <b>markings,</b> shadows and partial occlusion.

F. = 31. 736 Abstract We {{conducted}} a prospective study of 321 patients with cirrhosis {{of the liver}} and esophageal varices with no history of bleeding to see whether a comprehensive analysis of their clinical features and of the endoscopic appearances of their varices could help to identify those at highest risk for bleeding. Varices were classified endoscopically {{as suggested by the}} Japanese Research Society for Portal Hypertension. Patients were followed for 1 to 38 months (median, 23), during which 85 patients (26. 5 percent) bled. Multiple regression analysis (Cox's model) revealed that the risk of bleeding was significantly related to the patient's modified Child class (an index of liver dysfunction based on serum albumin concentration, bilirubin level, prothrombin time, and the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> ascites and encephalopathy), the size of the varices, and the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> red wale <b>markings</b> (longitudinal dilated venules resembling whip marks) on the varices. A prognostic index based on these variables was devised that enabled us to identify a subset of patients with a one-year incidence of bleeding exceeding 65 percent. The index was prospectively validated on an independent sample of 75 patients with varices and no history of bleeding. We conclude that our prognostic index, which identifies groups of patients with one-year probabilities of bleeding ranging from 6 to 76 percent, can be used to identify candidates for prophylactic treatment...|$|R
