5000|$|Utility is not {{directly}} measurable, so {{the true cost of}} living index only serves as a theoretical ideal, not a practical price index formula. However, more practical formulas can be evaluated based on their relationship to the true cost of living index. One of the most commonly used formulas for consumer price indices, the Laspeyres price index, compares the cost of what a consumer bought in one time period (q0) with how much it would have cost to buy the same set of goods and services in a later period. Since the utility from q0 in the first year should be equal to the utility from q0 in the next year, Laspeyres gives the upper bound for the true cost-of-living index. [...] Laspeyres only serves as an upper bound, because consumers could turn to substitute goods for those goods that have gotten more expensive and achieved the same level of utility from q0 for a lower cost. In contrast, a <b>Paasche</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> uses the cost of a set of goods purchased in one time period with the cost it would have taken to buy the same set of goods in an earlier time period. It can be shown that the Paasche is a lower bound for true cost of living index. Since upper and lower bounds of the true cost of living index can be found, respectively, through the Laspeyres and Paasche indices, the geometric average of the two, known as the Fisher price index, is a close approximation of the true cost of living index if the upper and lower bounds are not too far apart.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we measure the quality change which has {{occurred}} in U. S. steel imports during the 1969 - 74 VRA, using an index number method. Under this approach, the yearly changes in unit values is broken into three components: a quality-adjusted or pure price index; a quality index, which measures changes in the product mix; and a supplier index, which measures changes in the source of supply. We also derive a measure of welfare cost, which equals the inverse of a <b>Paasche</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> minus the inverse of an exact price index. Over the 1969 - 74 VRA period we find quality upgrading of 7. 4 percent in U. S. steel imports, which occurs most strongly in the first year. The welfare cost of quality change varies around one percent of import expenditure during 1970 - 73. This cost {{is at least as}} large as the conventional deadweight loss triangle, but smaller than the transfer of quota rents. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{breakdown}} of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates spurred the development of trade-weighted exchange rates(TWEXs). These indexes measure changes in the average foreign exchange value of a currency over time. The construction of a TWEX index requires numerous decisions. Producers of TWEXs are revisiting many of their construction decisions because, {{with the advent of}} the single currency in Europe, all TWEXs will have to be modified. In addition, countries adopting the single currency may find it useful to develop their own TWEXs, similar to those that exist for regions within the United States. All commonly-used TWEXs are based on either a Laspeyres or <b>Paasche</b> <b>price</b> <b>index.</b> In the present paper we argue that producers of TWEXs should consider using the chain approach for the construction of their indexes because of an issue that affects TWEXs based on either Laspeyres or Paasche price indexes - the choice of base period. We illustrate this problem and show how it leads to different measures of exchange rate changes. A chain index, which links together the exchange rates and trade weights from year-to-year, eliminates the needs for a base period. Foreign exchange...|$|E
40|$|The {{media and}} the public often make claims {{regarding}} the excessive cost increases {{in the development and}} production of major weapon systems such as fighter planes, submarines or tanks. The purpose of this research is in assessing the cost increase of such weapon systems during their procurement periods {{with the help of the}} <b>Paasche</b> <b>price</b> <b>index.</b> In contrast to other approaches, which focus upon either the specific situations of single weapon systems or cost increases relative to planned budgets, we compare several projects of military services and their cost increases over time to reveal generalisable trends. For this purpose, we used a framework model that allows for performance and cost comparisons. This paper primarily emphasises the cost perspective by calculating a Paasche index for each chosen project. As a background case for our analysis, we have used the acquisition projects for major weapon systems in Germany. However, the framework model that this study employs is universally applicable. In contrast to the public perception of cost increases, we could not find any clear trend that would indicate that modern weapon systems have a significantly higher (or lower) cos...|$|E
40|$|In some {{countries}} a <b>Paasche</b> <b>price</b> <b>index</b> based on unit values is compiled {{as a proxy}} for a true Paasche (or Laspeyres) price index on the basis of prices. This is for example the case in German foreign trade statistics. Unit values are average prices referring to a 'commodity number' (CN), that is an aggregate of (more or less homogeneous) commodities defined by a commodity classification. They are often easily available as free by-products of other statistics (foreign trade or wage statistics for example) and therefore less costly than true transaction prices of well-defined specific products as they are in general reported in price statistics. Changes in unit values between two points in time, however, do not only reflect a price movement but also changes in the quantities transacted. They are, in other words, affected by a structural component, the changing mix of commodities within CNs and therefore biased relative to genuine price indices. The focus of the paper is on explaining this bias. It is shown that amount and sign of the 'unit value bias' depends on the correlation between the change of quantities of the goods included in the CNs and their respective base period prices, while current period prices do not matter. This result is useful as it may help to define 'homogeneity' with respect to CNs and thus conditions under which unit values may be acceptable as (cost-effective) substitutes for prices...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, through {{review of the}} data {{obtained}} from reference material a successful attempt {{has been made to}} find out the inflation or increment of value of Indian mariculture products in the international market. No such attempts have been made earlier, therefore present study may be considered as a baseline. The percentage inflation in the export value of Indian mariculture products from 1996 to 1999 was 21. 77 %, from 1996 to 2002 it was inclined to 52. 64 % and from 1996 to 2005 it was just inclined to 56. 65 %. The export price of Indian mariculture products has increased from 1996 to 1999 by 21. 77 %, and from 1999 to 2002 by 30. 87 % which can be consider as good increment but from 2002 to 2005 it drastically declined to 4. 01 %, which is very poor increment price and harmful to the growth of mariculture farmers. The percentage inflation was determined using the <b>Paasche</b> <b>price</b> <b>index.</b> The Indian mariculture products export prices have shown a steady rise from 1996 to 2002 but from 2002 to 2005 the export price rise has declined drastically.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the theoretical properties of different price cap schemes {{that have been}} applied in the UK and the USA. The objective is to assess the consequences for price structures and welfare of different ways of defining the regulated price index. Chapter 2 surveys the literature on regulation under asymmetric information that is related to price caps. Chapter 3 presents a general analysis of five main types of price cap when the regulated firm sets linear tariffs. The schemes are the Tariff Basket (TB) scheme, the Fixed Weights (F) scheme, the Average Revenue (AR) scheme, the Average Revenue (Lagged) scheme, and the <b>Paasche</b> <b>Price</b> <b>Index</b> (PPI) scheme. The TB and PPI schemes generate efficient price structures in the long run, whereas prices are inefficient under the other schemes. In Chapter 4 the consequences of allowing freedom to set different prices, relative {{to the case of}} uniform prices, are analyzed. The conditions for price freedom to be desirable are derived for the case where the price level is not regulated. When the price level is regulated it is shown that AR regulation can cause welfare to be below the level that obtains without any regulation. Chapter 5 contains an analysis of the five price caps examined in Chapter 3 for the case where the firm sets a two-part tariff. The AR and PPI schemes are dominated, and the conditions under which TB, F and ARL are optimal are established. Chapter 6 explores some issues in the regulation of nonlinear tariffs by AR and TB price caps. Chapter 7 considers some extensions of the analysis. It is shown that when quality is a choice variable, the regulator is concerned about income distribution and there is demand growth the TB scheme can be adapted and retains its desirable properties. Chapter 8 contains conclusions and suggestions for future work...|$|E

40|$|In current practice, subaggregate chained volume {{measures}} (CVMs) {{are neither}} weighted nor additive. This paper derives and implements "weights" for weighted subaggregate CVMs to be additive (i. e., their sum equals aggregate CVM) because without weights, nonadditivity permits the nonsensical result that a subaggregate CVM could exceed aggregate CVM. The weights are ratios of subaggregate to aggregate chained price deflators that exceed, equal, or fall below 1 depending on relative prices. CVMs in current practice are additive {{in the special}} case of constant relative prices when all weights equal 1. If relative prices change, weights do not equal 1 and their use avoids nonadditivity and the above nonsensical result. Empirically, they have widespread implications because CVM is now implemented in over 40 countries. Application to actual GDP data shows significant distortions of GDP composition due to nonadditivity of subaggregate CVMs from ignoring relative price changes.
