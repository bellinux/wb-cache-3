40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to evaluate a method of maintaining stability of an air cushion vehicle and also to evaluate several concepts to brake and steer an ACLS-equipped vehicle. The investigation used a modified airboat equipped with an air cushion landing system. The <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> door stability concept was characterized by the ACLS pressure time histories. The <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> doors <b>vented</b> excess cavity and lobe pressures and consistently maintained vehicle heave and pitch stability. Braking concepts were characterized by the average deceleration of the vehicle. Reduced lobe flow and cavity venting braking concepts were evaluated in this program. The cavity venting concept demonstrated the best performance, producing decelerations on the test vehicle on the same order as moderate braking with conventional wheel brakes. Steering concepts were evaluated by recording the path taken while attempting to follow a prescribed maneuver. The steering concepts evaluated included using rudders only, using differential lobe flow, and using rudders combined with a lightly loaded, nonsteering center wheel. The latter concept {{proved to be the}} most accurate means of steering the vehicle on the ACLS, producing translational deviations which, while two to three times higher than those from conventional nose gear steering, were still felt to provide reasonably precise steering control for this type vehicle...|$|R
40|$|The {{biodiesel}} {{production process}} involves Class I flammables, corrosive chemicals, process tanks, and waste or extraneous by-product collection tanks. The regulatory requirement is that tanks {{be compatible with}} the product stored, but not specifically that they be stainless construction. Stainless is the most logical for the blending tank and since biodiesel has corrosive characteristics somewhat greater than diesel {{it is not a}} bad choice for storage and the waste product collection tank. The Class I flammable is methanol and the tank storing methanol must be built to UL 142 standards for a Class I flammable. A common practice currently used in biodiesel production is to use plastic IBC or totes for the methanol, but that is illegal as these containers are not listed for Class I liquids and do not have the proper safety mechanisms. Last fall a bio plant burned to the ground in Bakersfield, CA from a fire that originated from a static spark while transferring methanol into the tote. Comm 10 does not regulate process tanks, but since the process reaction involves heat, chemicals and a flammable liquid, the process tank needs to have adequate <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> and <b>venting</b> safeguards.

40|$|From {{a safety}} standpoint, {{regardless}} of plant or facility type, {{the most important}} pieces of equipment are the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> devices. The most critical characteristics of a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> device are its set pressure and the related relieving capacity. The Set Pressure of a <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> device is defined as that value of increasing inlet static pressure at which the discharge becomes continuous (ASME PTC 25 - 1994, Performance Test Codes). To preclude an unsafe overpressure situation, the set pressure of the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> device must not exceed the {{maximum allowable working pressure}} of the equipment or system being protected. Because of testing facility limitations, size or <b>pressure,</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valves intended for elevated temperature service are often set using ambient temperature air.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valve {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} devices used on the security of pipelines, since it is responsible to guarantee the integrity of the installations. Generally, the response and behavior of a relief valve during its transient is unknown by users, who employ simplified and static analysis to design the pipeline, further, the information provided by manufactures is limited. The flow-pressure, displacement-time and pressure –time relationships are an important external characteristic of the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valve and the hydraulic circuit. So, many engineers have been put an effort on this topic for its significant impact on the overall hydraulic system. Most of them are focused on the influences of the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> valves, their selections and applications. It is very important to select, size, locate properly and maintain the <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> systems to prevent or minimize the losses from major incidents.

40|$|The use of <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts {{has often}} been {{proposed}} {{as a means of}} reducing pressure fluctuations and of improving passenger comfort on board high-speed trains in tunnels. The recently opened rail-link between Mattstetten-Rothrist in Switzerland {{is one of the first}} rail projects where such shafts became an integral part of the project right from the design stage. The effectiveness of <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts has been proven during the commissioning phase of this 45 km long new rail-link. Several aerodynamic measurements were conducted in different tunnels with and without <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts and with different train types. One example is the double-track Emmequerung tunnel with a free cross-sectional area of Atunnel = 76 m 2 with two <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts (Ashaft = 12. 25 m 2). The same tunnel without any <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts would have required a larger free cross-sectional area of Atunnel = 105 m 2 in order to satisfy the project specific comfort criteria for various train types (∆ptrain < 1. 5 kPa within 4 s). In general, smaller tunnel cross-sections lead to reduced construction costs. Furthermore <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts can be combined with additional functions (egress path, smoke extraction, climate improvement, etc.). These advantages must be balanced with possible disadvantages (noise emissions, increased local air flows in the tunnel, etc.) and the limitations (ground overburden). The experience gained from the new Swiss rail-link shows that under certain conditions <b>pressure</b> <b>relief</b> shafts are effective and reasonable. 1...|$|R
