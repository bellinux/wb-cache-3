40|$|This Doctoral {{research}} {{investigates the}} role and potential of industrial design to confront product obsolescence in the consumer electronics sector. It investigates how design strategies can be developed to prolong the <b>lifespans</b> of <b>products</b> so to mitigate environmental impacts and contribute towards sustainable consumption. The predominant response by industry and policy makers to environmental problems associated with consumer electronics has been through improved energy efficiency and, more recently, strategies to manage end-of-life waste. However, the volume and speed in which consumer electronics are produced, consumed and made obsolete remains unprecedented. Such circumstances can easily override and negate the effectiveness of efficiency and waste management responses. Moreover, as the lifespan {{for many of these}} products, notably personal computers and mobile phones gets shorter many consumer electronics products are still in functional order when disposed of. Product design, technological change, expanding digital infrastructure, replacement verses repair costs, the migration of electronics into new product sectors, in addition to our seemingly insatiable appetite for new and novel goods all contribute to reducing <b>product</b> <b>lifespans.</b> This research investigates design strategies to prolong <b>product</b> <b>lifespans.</b> By investigating existing product features, user behaviours and societal factors lifespans strategies that can prolong product are identified. Three particular design strategies have been developed to explore this proposition - Piggybacking, Reassignment and Scripting. Piggybacking specifically addresses products that are vulnerable to obsolescence from step changes in technology, such as the migration to digital technologies; while a Reassignment strategy is appropriate for products that susceptible to rapid technological change. On the other hand, Scripting is a framework strategy that can guide user behaviour to circumvent premature obsolescence by designing in 'scripts' within the product. These three strategies offer a new direction and opportunity for product innovation to tackle obsolescence in technological product sectors. It is argued throughout this research that design practice can occur both formally and informally. Designers often establish the circumstances within a product that can lead to obsolescence, while it is the user who often determines actual product life. However, if a product can be adaptable for changing circumstances it is better able to avoid obsolescence. Industrial designers can enable user-adaptation of products through the design of open products. An open product delegates a role of design to the user thereby enabling a product to be adaptable to changing circumstances, prolonging its lifespan. This research contributes new knowledge about <b>product</b> <b>lifespans</b> and design practice. It demonstrates the importance of user behaviour in determining product life by documenting many informal examples of prolonged product life. It applies new design strategies that can lead to new design innovation...|$|R

Advancements have also been made on the nano level. Packaging that avails itself of nanotechnology can create barriers to gases, humidity or UV radiation. New technology also helps at making the product weigh less. Increasingly, biopolymers are used as the material basis for packaging, replacing fossil-based polymers. Yet, new packaging types tend to face issues like a higher price and hence, difficulties in competition with the cheaper fossil-based materials.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} two {{important}} practises in supply chain management, postponement and product perishability. In the first essay, we consider a retailer that replenishes its inventory {{by making a}} delivery request without specifying order quantity, then deciding the quantity when the delivery vehicle arrives after one period. A fixed cost is incurred whenever a delivery request is made. The new feature {{of this research is}} the postponement of ordering until one-period demand information is observed. We show that the optimal policy for delivery requests is of a threshold type. The optimal decision on ordering is more complex, there might be multiple order-up-to levels. Numerical studies show that the cost of an ordering policy that considers (at most) two order-up-to levels is close to the minimal, especially when the planning horizon is not too short. We also identify conditions under which a base-stock policy is optimal for ordering. To understand the effects of ordering postponement, we compare our model with the traditional model (Scarf 1960). We show that postponement leads to a lower cost and a higher threshold for making delivery requests. In the second essay, we consider a supply chain of a supplier and a retailer where the <b>product</b> <b>lifespan</b> is controllable and subject to investment. We derive the optimal order quantity and <b>product</b> <b>lifespan</b> decisions for several decentralized supply chain models, one assumes only the retailer may invest into the <b>product</b> <b>lifespan</b> and the other allows both parties to invest. Our analysis indicates that the investment opportunity creates significant benefits to the entire supply chain. Whenever a party, the retailer or the supplier, chooses to invest into <b>product</b> <b>lifespan,</b> both parties benefit yet her profit share within the supply chain decreases. Other relevant issues such as the impacts on channel coordination and pricing are also investigated.

Strategies and actions to improve product lifespans {{is just one}} of many contributions that design is investigating as a part of the SCP agenda. Drawing examples from the consumer electronics sector, this paper considers the likely effectiveness of <b>product</b> <b>lifespan</b> strategies to mitigate environmental and social impacts. It argues that behavioural and structural obstacles, which lay behind product obsolescence, can undermine design for <b>product</b> <b>lifespan</b> strategies. By shifting emphasis from design for product life to design for material life, many of these behavioural and structural obstacles could be avoided. The imperative shifts from prolonging product life to prolonging material life (the stuff from which products are made of), in the consumption production economy. This can be achieved, in part, by building new alliances with the growing de-manufacturing sector opening up new possibilities for design innovation. Material lifespan strategies are surveyed with specific reference to the consumer electronics sector. Design for material life could effectively tackle escalating consumption, especially in fast growing sectors such as consumer electronics goods...|$|E

On the other hand, businesses face pressure {{to succeed in the}} highly competed global market. This master's thesis aims to show, how businesses could manufacture or use longer lasting products and be profitable at the same time - the objective of this thesis is to find out, how business models could enable the extension of <b>product</b> <b>lifespans.</b> The literature review of this thesis presents the background of planned obsolescence, a phenomenon which has led people to ask, why products no longer last. Whether it is physical or technological obsolescence, consumers can or will not use products as long as they used to. Also previous research around the business model concept and sustainable business models is discussed. The reasoning behind what makes a business model a good unit for analyzing product life extension is explained in the methodology section. The empirical part of this thesis focuses especially on what the characteristics of such business models are that have made product life extension possible. This research is conducted as a multiple case study, in which altogether five different business models from different industries act as the case studies. The data is collected from multiple sources: two semi-structured interviews are conducted, and secondary data from e. g. company websites, newspapers and government institutions' websites is collected. The data is analyzed according to three business model features: value proposition, revenue model and customer interface. Afterwards the features of the case business models are compared to those of their competitors. The research indicates that there are numerous factors that influence the success of business models which extend <b>product</b> <b>lifespans.</b> On the basis of the case study it can be concluded that such factors as ageless and aesthetic product design, efficiency and experience in running a service supply chain, offering a service instead of a product (servitization), powerful brand stories, reuse and recycling of products and materials, and warranty as a quality promise can help companies in producing and using longer lasting products, as well as in profiting from them. Nevertheless, the suitability of these factors may be industry and even business specific. Moving to a more service-centered way of consumption could offer a solution to the environmental problems and scarcity of resources we are facing on the planet. Servitization seems to work especially for B 2 B types of companies, but product-service systems for consumers seem to be more difficult to achieve.

40|$|The {{unsustainable}} {{consumption and}} waste {{of natural resources}} is a legacy of modern times, born largely from the inappropriate marriage of excessive material durability with fleeting <b>product</b> <b>lifespans.</b> Waste management facilities throughout the European Union (EU) are overloaded with fully functioning domestic electronic products (DEPs). In many cases, waste of this nature can be seen as nothing more than a symptom of a failed relationship between the user and the product. This is because consumer desire is unstable; it continually evolves and adapts, whilst the DEPs deployed to both mediate and satisfy those desires remain relatively frozen in time. It is this incapacity for evolution and growth that renders most products incapable of both establishing and sustaining relationships with users. The waste this inconsistency generates is substantial, coming at increasing cost to manufacturers facing the policy-driven demands of the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive and, perhaps more importantly, the natural world. We must therefore begin to consider the emergent paradigm of emotionally durable design to propose new and alternative genres of DEPs that reduce the consumption and waste of resources by increasing the resilience of relationships established between consumers and their products; presenting a more expansive, holistic approach to design for durability, and more broadly, the lived experience of sustainability...|$|R

40|$|Sustainability {{has become}} a major concern of {{contemporary}} product design. Whether it 2 ̆ 7 s furniture, appliances, apparel, or technology designers of every field must now consider the ecological impact of the products that they create. Sustainability of material resources, impact and by products of manufacturing processes, energy using in production, <b>product</b> <b>lifespan,</b> and disposal are all things that must be carefully considered to maximize product sustainability. Strategies for reducing negative environmental impact include maximizing material usage, using recycled and or biodegradable materials, minimizing product weight and transportation, reducing energy consumption, and dematerialization. In more recent years the idea of increasing <b>product</b> <b>lifespan</b> has received a lot of attention from design theorists. This doesn 2 ̆ 7 t just mean making goods that can physically last a lifetime and have superior performance. The consumer must have an attachment to the object. This attachment comes from an emotional connection. Contemporary designers must find innovative ways of creating an emotional bond between product and consumer. How can mass produced goods achieve this goal? I believe the answer is involving the consumer in the design process in order to personalize and customize the products they buy. Made to order goods offer the customer the opportunity to co-design the products that they desire so that they suit particular needs and wants. Instead of selecting pre-manufactured goods from a store or website consumers can now personalize and customize an increasing number and range of products. Companies like Longchamp, Nike, Levis, Addidas, and Ralph Lauren are capitalizing on the fact that consumers want to personalize and customize the products they consume without having to lift a finger. By allowing customers to choose colors, sizes, styles, and even adding personalized logos these companies are capitalizing on the fact that consumers want customization. People become more invested and more attached to objects that they have spent effort in creating, allow for self-expression, and that are unique to the user. The consumer is allowed to be creative but this is only from a limited amount of choices available to them. My research involves taking the concept of customization further to make products that are completely unique to an individual. Nothing is more personal and individualized than the human fingerprint. I am exploring how the fingerprint can be abstracted and used as texture on the surface of furniture. By making objects that are personalized to the user it is my goal to deepen the connection between owner and object to increase <b>product</b> <b>lifespan...</b>|$|E

30|$|Implementation {{strategies}} {{toward the}} realization of sustainable consumption have become a top priority {{in the past two}} decades. A high importance has been placed on the aspects of using habits and recycling behaviors by researchers in an attempt to increase <b>product</b> <b>lifespans</b> and reduce waste (Bianchi and Birtwistle 2010; Birtwistle and Moore 2007). Sustainable apparel usage may include behaviors such as reducing laundry frequency, wearing old clothing in new ways, using clothing products longer (Tilikidou and Delistavrou 2004), or swapping clothes (Mont 2004). WRAP (2011) has also put forward a number of revenue generation opportunities for the apparel industry, such as sale of re-designed clothing items, services of teaching consumers to use old clothing to generate different looks, affordable services of clothing repair/alteration, as well as collection of pre-owned apparel items for new uses. Recycling calls for extending the life of products by reusing or redesigning, instead of disposing of them. However, the fast fashion strategy makes it possible for more apparel products to be produced, which make their way onto store shelves and are then disposed of by consumers in a much shorter period of time resulting in increased material output and waste volumes (Birtwistle and Moore 2007). Therefore, extending the lifespan of apparel goods becomes {{one of the most important}} ways to reduce apparel waste.|$|R

40|$|The short lifespans of {{consumer}} electronics products remains a relatively unattended problem {{compared to the}} many other environmental and social pressures that are highlighted in society today. Climate change, poverty and natural resource depletion and contamination are three in particular that require urgent action. However, the volume and speed in which consumer electronics are produced, consumed and made obsolete remains unprecedented. Since {{the advent of the}} mass-produced microprocessor and low-cost manufacturing, along with increasing affluence and aspiring ownership for more material goods, the consumption {{of consumer}} electronics has escalated dramatically. What were formerly described as ‘consumer durables’, are now often regarded as ‘consumables’. The lifespan for many of these products, notably personal computers and mobile phones, is getting shorter, with many still in functional order when disposed of. Product design, technological change, expanding digital infrastructure, replacement verses repair costs, the migration of electronics into new product sectors, in addition to our seemingly insatiable appetite for new and novel goods all contribute to reducing <b>product</b> <b>lifespans.</b> This research investigates the potential of Industrial Design to confront obsolescence in the consumer electronics sector.
