50|$|The Junior Warden’s Chair {{has been}} broken and a new top of a {{different}} style added on, containing a group of tools. The two columns supporting the back are unfluted and were Ionic columns, but the capitals are broken, whilst the upper parts have gone. The ornaments on the legs are of the <b>plumb</b> <b>rule</b> as in the W.M.’s chair.|$|E
50|$|Any {{number of}} clients may listen on a named port (a file) for messages. Ports and port routing are defined by <b>plumbing</b> <b>rules.</b> These rules are dynamic. Each {{listening}} program receives a copy of matching messages. For example, if the data /sys/lib/plumb/basic is plumbed with the standard rules, it {{is sent to the}} edit port. The port will write a copy of the message to each listener. In this case, all running editors will interpret this message as a file name, and open the file.|$|R

This report discusses (1) EPA's data on the rule's implementation; (2) what implementation of the rule suggests about the need for changes to the regulatory framework; and (3) the extent to which drinking water at schools and child care facilities is tested for lead. ...|$|R

50|$|The Worshipful Master’s chair has two Corinthian {{columns and}} is {{decorated}} with four plumb rules on the several faces of the legs, {{but it is also}} decorated with the square and compasses and on the back the open book of the sacred word, square and compasses and the level and <b>plumb</b> <b>rule.</b> Surmounting the columns were two globes, now gone, and at the back is the mark of a support for a lantern which is now removed. On the top of the ornament over the back is a Royal Crown which has been added on at a later date. This crown implies that the chair was in use for the Royal Arch Degree, or it may refer to the Lodge being a “Royal” Lodge.|$|E

60|$|Human labor, {{through all}} its forms, from the {{sharpening}} of a stake {{to the construction}} of a city or an epic, is one immense illustration of the perfect compensation of the universe. The absolute balance of Give and Take, the doctrine that everything has its price,--and if that price is not paid, not that thing but something else is obtained, and {{that it is impossible to}} get anything without its price,--is not less sublime in the columns of a ledger than in the budgets of states, in the laws of light and darkness, in all the action and reaction of nature. I cannot doubt that the high laws which each man sees implicated in those processes with which he is conversant, the stern ethics which sparkle on his chisel edge, which are measured out by his <b>plumb</b> and foot <b>rule,</b> which stand as manifest in the footing of the shop bill as in the history of a state,--do recommend to him his trade, and though seldom named, exalt his business to his imagination.|$|R
