40|$|Now a day’s dust {{pollution}} {{is the major}} environmental issue inside an opencast mine, which has various effects on human life. There {{are a number of}} fugitive sources, and activities which cause dust pollution inside an opencast mine eg. Drilling, transportation, blasting, crushing, conveying, overburden face, haul road etc. Among these dust, there are some toxic and carcinogenic dust which are when exposed to the workers that lead to different serious health effects like silicosis and lungs cancer. So measurement of these dust concentration is necessary to know the impact of various mining activity on the surrounding environment. From the above view, this current project mainly focuses on the dust sampling by using high volume dust sampler i. e. Envirotech APM 460 NL and Envirotech APM 550, measuring the personal dust exposure of different workmen at different mining sites by using <b>Personal</b> <b>Dust</b> <b>Sampler</b> (Model Arelco Ineris CIP 10), and characterization of the dust collected from the filter paper by using FTIR (Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy). For this purpose Lajkura Opencast Project was chosen which produces 30 MT of coal per year for convenience, because as it is a large opencast mine so better knowledge can be gained from this mine regarding the concentration and effects of the dust. The dust sampling and monitoring was conducted during the month of March 2016 to get a good assess of dust.

To meet emerging needs for precise measurements of RCS, from shorter sampling periods (< 4 h) and lower air concentrations, collaborative work was done to assess the differences between personal respirable samplers at higher flow rates. The performance of FSP 10, GK 2. 69, and CIP 10 R samplers were {{compared with that of}} the Safety In Mines <b>Personal</b> <b>Dust</b> <b>Sampler</b> (SIMPEDS) sampler as a reference, which is commonly used in the UK for the measurement of RCS. In addition, the performance of the FSP 10 and GK 2. 69 samplers were compared; at the nominal flow rates recommended by the manufacturers of 10 and 4. 2 l 27 min(- 1) and with flow rates proposed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of 11. 2 and 4. 4 l 27 min(- 1). Samplers were exposed to aerosols of ultrafine and medium grades of Arizona road dust (ARD) generated in a calm air chamber. All analyses for RCS in this study were performed at the Health and Safety Laboratory. The difference in flow rates for the GK 2. 69 is small and does not result in a substantial difference in collection efficiency for the dusts tested, while the performance of the FSP 10 at 11. 2 l 27 min(- 1) was more comparable with samples from the SIMPEDS. Conversely, the GK 2. 69 collected proportionately more crystalline silica in the respirable dust than other samplers, which then produced RCS results most comparable with the SIMPEDS. The CIP 10 R collected less ultrafine ARD than other samplers, as might be expected based on earlier performance evaluations. The higher flow rate for the FSP 10 should be an added advantage for task-specific sampling or when measuring air concentrations less than current occupational exposure limits...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} repeated {{measurements of}} inhalable flour dust, wheat allergens and a-amylase allergens in the bakery industry. A total of 571 full-shift <b>personal</b> <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> was collected. Wheat allergens and a-amylase allergens were measured in 449 and 507 samples, respectively, {{by the use}} of recently developed immunoassays. For all three measures of exposure, the main components of exposure variability were determined. Different grouping strategies for studying exposure-response relationships were compared. The specific job of a bakery worker was identified as the most important source of variability in inhalable flour dust concentrations. For exposure to wheat allergens, the job performed was also the most important source of variation, but type of bakery also explained some of the variability. For a-amylase allergen exposure, information on type of bakery was more important then job information. For exposure to inhalable dust and wheat allergens, a classification by job title would lead to sufficient contrast in average exposure levels. By contrast, a grouping strategy based on a combination of job and type of bakery appeared to be essential to obtain a useful classification of exposure to a-amylase allergens. © 1997 British Occupational Hygiene SocietyJ Published by Elsevier Science Lt...|$|R

40|$|Dust {{pollution}} {{is the most}} important environmental issue associated with any opencast mining activity. Drilling, blasting, loading, transportation, crushing, conveying, haul road and the exposed overburden face generate large quantities of fugitive dust. Silica is a potential carcinogen and its exposure to the workers may be detrimental to their health which may result in progress of silicosis and lung cancer. Prediction of dust concentration in and around the mine is essential to have an impact assessment of the mining activity over the surrounding environment. In the view of this, current project work focuses on the real time monitoring of dust level at different sources of the mine using DustTrak II, personal exposure of dust to different workers using <b>personal</b> <b>dust</b> <b>sampler,</b> characterization of dust collected from different locations using FT-IR and finally prediction of dust concentration at different locations of the mine and nearby areas using AERMOD view software. Lakhanpur opencast project, the largest opencast mine of MCL in the Ib valley area producing more than 15 MT of coal per annum, was chosen for study to have a better knowledge about the impact assessment due to dust from large opencast mines.

Methods Fifty workers were randomly selected from a cohort of 684 miners from 3 bituminous coalmines in Mpumalanga, South Africa. Peak expiratory efforts were measured prior to the commencement of the shift, {{and at the end of}} the shift on at least two occasions separated by at least 2 weeks, with full shift <b>personal</b> <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> being conducted on each occasion for each participant. Interviews were conducted, work histories were obtained and cumulative exposure estimates were constructed. Regression models examined the associations of cross-shift changes in PEFR with current and cumulative exposure, controlling for shift, smoking and past history of tuberculosis. Results There were marginal differences in cross-shift PEFR (ranging from 0. 1 to 2 L/min). Linear regression analyses showed no association between cross-shift change in PEFR and current or cumulative exposure. The specific shift worked by participants in the study showed no effect. Conclusions Our study showed no association between current respirable dust exposure and cross-shift changes in PEFR. There was a non-significant protective effect of cumulative dust exposure on the outcome, suggesting the presence of a “healthy worker survivor effect” in this data. Am. J. Ind.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{a large population}} of cotton textile weavers for reported respiratory symptoms relative to occupational factors, smoking, and exposure to dust. Cotton processing is known to produce a respiratory disease known as byssinosis particularly in the early processes of cotton spinning. Relatively {{little is known about}} the respiratory health of the cotton weavers who produce cloth from spun cotton. By the time cotton is woven many of the original contaminants have been removed. METHODS: 1295 operatives from a target population of 1428 were given an interviewer led respiratory questionnaire. The presence of upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms were sought and the work relatedness of these symptoms determined by a stem questionnaire design. Also occupational and demographic details were obtained and spirometry and <b>personal</b> <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> performed. RESULTS: Byssinosis was present in only four people (0. 3 %). Chronic bronchitis had a moderate overall prevalence of about 6 % and was related predominantly to smoking. There were several other work related respiratory symptoms (persistent cough 3. 9 %, chronic production of phlegm 3. 6 %, chest tightness 4. 8 %, wheezing 5. 4 %, and breathlessness 2. 3 %). All of these were predicted predominantly by smoking (either past or present), with no consistent independent effect of exposure to dust. Work related eye and nasal symptoms were more common (10. 4 % and 16. 9 % respectively). CONCLUSION: Byssinosis is a rare respiratory symptom in cotton weaving.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Two stonemasons working {{together}} in an environment with high concentrations of quartz pursued very different clinical courses; one died of rapidly progressive silicosis and the other developed hilar adenopathy and, later, early massive fibrosis. The exposures to quartz of these two men were investigated to allow comment on the pathogenesis of severe silicosis relative to concentrations of dust. METHODS: Estimates of exposure were based on previously taken <b>personal</b> <b>dust</b> <b>samples,</b> detailed lifetime occupational histories, and semiquantitative exposure modelling. RESULTS: One {{of the men who}} died had a 30 year exposure estimated to have averaged < 0. 1 mg/m 3, leading to hilar node fibrosis and calcification, followed by a five year exposure to about 2 mg/m 3 which proved fatal. Estimates of exposure tallied with postmortem measurement of lung burden, suggesting retention of all dust deposited in the lungs over his final period of work. The younger man, working from the start of his apprenticeship alongside the older one, had a six year exposure to about 1. 5 mg/m 3, which caused hilar node enlargement and subsequent calcification but minimal lung involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Exposures to relatively low concentrations of quartz may be capable of causing hilar node fibrosis, impairing the clearance of any quartz inhaled subsequently. The findings support the concept that destruction of the hilar nodes by silicotic fibrosis, impairing lung clearance, has an important pathogenic {{role in the development of}} massive fibrosis, and in men subsequently exposed to very high concentrations of respirable quartz, rapidly progressive silicosis...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Silica is {{a common}} silicon dioxide (SiO 2) that can be {{crystalline}} or non-crystalline (amorphous). Amorphous silica {{is considered to be}} less hazardous than crystalline silica. Three dominant crystalline polymorphs exist, with silica quartz being the most common. Exposure to respirable crystalline silica (quartz) causes silicosis, a lung scarring disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and quantify the silica exposure in respirable <b>dust</b> <b>personal</b> exposure <b>samples,</b> as well as in representative bulk samples which are large samples taken from the sources of airborne dust obtained from different mining and production plants involved in the production of titanium dioxide from beach sand. This is needed to determine the degree of risk of developing silicosis. Forty five workers employed in different mining and production plants participated in this study. Their eight-hour personal exposure to respirable particulate was determined. <b>Personal</b> respirable <b>dust</b> exposure <b>samples</b> and bulk samples were analyzed for silica by an accredited laboratory by means of X-ray diffraction based on NIOSH method 7500. Silica quartz was detected in <b>personal</b> respirable <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> and bulk <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> obtained from the mining and production plants, but amorphous silica was only detected in three personal exposure samples at the Slag plant and in the bulk sample obtained from the Roaster plant. All the silica quartz and amorphous silica concentrations in personal exposure samples were well below their respective exposure limits of 0. 1 mg/m 3 (quartz) and 3 mg/m 3 (amorphous). No significant differences were found between the silica quartz concentrations in personal respirable exposure samples obtained from the mining ponds and the production plants, although a practical significance was found between some mining and production area personal exposure samples. The non-significant differences found between exposure concentrations and a practical significance suggest the necessity of involving a larger sample group in future. Other studies done in non-mining industries showed that some workers were over exposed to respirable silica dust. Compared to these findings the results of the present study showed the opposite, with respirable silica dust levels being below the South African action level and OEL. Further research, involving more samples, spread over a longer period of time, would probably be able to show a clear trend as to how quartz structures and exposure profiles change from the mining to the various production processes. Overexposure to silica quartz anywhere at the mine and production processes is considered unlikely, with the risk of developing silicosis being low. Master...|$|R

The Obuasi gold mine is one of the world’s oldest and richest goldmines producing about eighty percent of Ghana’s gold output. The study was conducted to quantify personal exposure to respirable dust and silica for different underground mining occupations in the Obuasi mine. <b>Personal</b> respirable <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> were taken from a stratified sample of 125 (10 %) of the 1229 underground miners available for the study. All filter samples were analysed gravimetrically and 1 in 10 filters analysed for their silica content. The mean shift/daily concentration of the underground respirable dust was 0. 83 mg/m 3 (SD ± 0. 55) and a range of 0. 07 to 2. 86 mg/m 3 over a mean sampling time of 6 hours.

40|$|Purpose. Exposures {{to paper}} dust, {{classified}} as Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated (PNOR), {{in an industrial}} setting can cause irritation to the eyes, skin, throat and upper respiratory tract. An exposure assessment was conducted to evaluate the paper dust exposures in the coupon manufacturing facility during a normal production working period. Methods. Total and respirable <b>personal</b> <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> was performed according to NIOSH 0500 and 0600 methods. Six total <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> and seven respirable <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> were taken within the sampling areas where airborne paper dust was produced to evaluate the Time Weighted Average (TWA) of the exposed employees. Results. Results showed that the TWAs for total dust within the three sampling areas ranged from 0. 4 % to 4. 7 % of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) and 0. 5 % to 7. 1 % of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV), except sample RD- 4 in the Baler Room. TWAs for respirable dust within the Press Room and Collation Area ranged from 0. 8 % to 0. 9 % of the OSHA PEL for all samples and 1. 4 % to 1. 5 % of the ACGIH TLV. Descriptive statistics showed the sample standard deviation for both total and respirable dust to be below 1. 0. The coefficient of variation for TWAs of total dust in the Press Room was 32. 7 % while all other total dust and respirable dust coefficient of variations for TWA ranged from 1. 3 % to 3. 4 %. Conclusion. Exposures to paper dust ranged from 0. 4 % to 7. 1 % of either the OSHA PEL or ACGIH TLV with an exception of sample RD- 4 in the Baler Room which was 34 % of the OSHA PEL and 56. 7 % of the ACGIH TLV. Identical respirable dust data and variable total dust data in the Press Room and Collation Area suggest that the dust being generated is of a larger particle size and therefore affects the nose, throat, and upper lungs. The engineering and administrative controls present appeared to be adequate based on the sampling data. Respiratory Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) was not considered a requirement but should be permitted if requested. Present workplace practices also appeared adequate based on the sampling data...|$|R

A hypothetical cost comparison analysis of the PDM with the current MSHA-required coal mine <b>dust</b> <b>personal</b> <b>sampling</b> unit (CMDPSU) was conducted. Some simplifying assumptions were made to create hypothetical cases for analysis. This analysis was limited to respirable <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> of one designated operator (DO) and one designated area (DA) for one mechanized mining unit (MMU) which operated one shift per day. Only sampling intervals of the minimum sampling as required by federal regulations and continuous sampling were analyzed. This cost analysis from the company perspective is only one part of an overall cost/benefit analysis that should be conducted at a later date. In this analysis, company-associated costs were examined for both sampling systems. Results show that the PDM, while it has high initial costs of approximately $ 12, 600, may be a cost-effective sampling system for measuring coal mine respirable dust. The estimated present worth cost of conducting the minimum required <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> over a five-year life ranges from $ 5, 850 to $ 19, 000 for the CMDPSU, with the higher present worth cost including costs of potential violations incurred. For the PDM, the comparable present worth cost is $ 14, 900 to $ 19, 300, with the lower present worth cost representing a lower capital cost of $ 8, 150 per unit if more than 850 units are produced per year, while the higher present worth cost reflects the result with the higher $ 12, 600 capital cost...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{studying}} dust generation from blasthole drills {{developed a}} simple, quick fix that reduced respirable dust concentrations {{by more than}} 63 % at the dump point. This device, which requires almost no maintenance, is small and inexpensive, and it will help operators maintain compliance to the dust standard. The thought process was that a reduction of respirable dust {{at any of the}} multiple sources on the drill, in this case the dust collector dump point, should reduce the total respirable dust generated by the drill. The U. S. Mine Safety & Health Administration (MSHA) has a coal respirable dust standard of 2 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m 3) for an 8 -hour shift. MSHA and mine operators periodically collect <b>personal</b> <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> to determine compliance with this dust standard. Drill operators have one of the highest exposure levels to respirable dust. This has been proven through many reviews of the MSHA <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> database. Prior to 1987, the highwall driller at surface coal mines had the most severe exposure to respirable silica dust, a trend that continues today based on MSHA's respirable <b>dust</b> <b>sampling</b> database. A review of the MSHA database for the years 1985 through 1992 shows that 81 % of the respirable silica <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> taken exceeded the permissible exposure limit for the highwall drill operator at surface coal mines. A more recent review of the MSHA database, for the years 1996 through 2000, shows that only 31 % of the respirable silica <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> taken exceeded the respirable silica dust limit for the highwall driller at surface coal mines. This suggests a substantial improvement in preventing the exposure of silica dust to the highwall drill operator. The drill operator, however, still tops the list of job occupations that have the highest exposure to respirable silica dust Respirable dust {{has been shown to be}} harmful to human health, especially when silica is present in the dust. It causes a disease known as silicosis, which can occur in three levels: chronic silicosis, which occurs after 10 years of exposure; accelerated silicosis, which occurs between 5 and 10 years of exposure; and acute silicosis, which can occur within a few weeks to five years of very high exposure to silica dust. Respirable dust consists of the dust particle size fraction whose median diameter is 4 micrometers (m). The drilling machine generates high concentrations of respirable dust from several sources: drill table shroud leakage, dust leakage through the table bushing, dust discharge from the dust collector exhaust due to impaired filters, and dust entrained from the dust collector fines dumped onto the bench. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Lab (PRL) has been studying different methods to reduce respirable dust from these sources. During its testing, the institute identified a simple solution that reduces the amount of respirable dust generated at the collector dump point...|$|R

During 1998 more than 5600 mineworkers were certified with silicosis, a silica related lung disease. The objective of this research project is to describe the trend in respirable dust concentrations in four underground gold mines for the period 1999 to 2002. The mines under discussion are situated in the Klerksdorp area and they were selected because they are a typical representation of deep underground gold mines. Typical gold mines use the same method of ventilation distribution and have similar dust sources e. g. breaking, transporting and tipping of rock. They are all situated in the same geographical area and all make use of conventional mining methods. A total of 4645 previously collected <b>personal</b> respirable <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> were analysed for this research report making use of a central laboratory situated in the Klerksdorp area. The respirable <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> were collected by the Occupational Hygienists appointed on the mines for control purposes over the years 1999 to 2002. The arithmetic mean respirable dust concentrations for the four mines in discussion was 0, 39 mg/m 3 in 1999, 0, 33 mg/m 3 in 2000, 0, 30 mg/m 3 in 2001 and 0, 31 mg/m 3 in 2002 against the mine’s internal target of 0, 4 mg/m 3.

Eighteen exposures each lasting six hours were performed while carding unwashed and washed cottons from the three major growing regions of the United States. Elutriated dust was analysed gravimetrically and was comparable (0. 59 mg/m 3 +/- 0. 04) for all exposures. Spirometry was recorded before and after each exposure. California cotton resulted in a significantly smaller fall in FEV 1 than cotton of the same grade from Texas or Mississippi. All washed cottons resulted in reduced declines when compared with unwashed cottons. For 17 subjects breathing zone <b>personal</b> total <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> were analysed for airborne endotoxin and compared with the individual's pulmonary function response. A significant correlation between endotoxin exposure and acute decrease in FEV 1 was seen. The effect on FEV 1 per nanogram of airborne endotoxin was greater for Mississippi cotton than for cotton from the other regions.

40|$|After {{identification}} of a case of extrinsic allergic alveolitis due to exposure to wood dust at a sawmill, all employees at the sawmill where he worked were studied with an occupational, environmental, and symptom questionnaire, spirometry, skin prick tests, and serum specific IgG measurements. Ninety five of current and 14 of 17 ex-sawmill workers were studied. As a basis for comparison, a group of 58 workers from a nearby light engineering factory were also studied. Few women (6) were employed and they {{were excluded from the}} analysis. Workers at the sawmill were stratified into high and low exposure groups depending on their place of work. This division was supported both by their subjective assessment of the dustiness of their environment and the results of <b>personal</b> <b>dust</b> <b>samples.</b> There {{were no significant differences between}} the three groups in age, height, smoking habits, exposure to other causes of extrinsic allergic alveolitis, forced expiratory volume in one second, forced vital capacity, atopic state, or cutaneous reactivity to moulds. In the high exposure group the prevalence of work related cough and nasal and eye symptoms was higher than in the low exposure and comparison groups. The prevalence of work related wheeze was similar in both the high exposure and comparison groups, but was lower in the low exposure group. The prevalences of chronic bronchitis and symptomatic bronchial hyper-reactivity were similar in the high and low exposure groups but were lower in the comparison group. Serum concentrations of specific IgG against extracts of sawdust and Trichoderma koningii were significantly higher in the high exposure group than in the other two groups. The prevalence of symptoms suggestive of extrinsic allergic alveolitis was 4. 4 % in the high exposure group, greater than in the low exposure group (0 %), and the comparison group (1. 9 %). In conclusion extrinsic allergic alveolitis probably occurs in British sawmills, and among the exposed population its prevalence may be as high as that reported in Sweden. The allergen responsible is likely to be from mould growing on the wood and may be from Trichoderma koningii...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Allergens {{produced}} by domestic mites (DM) {{are among the}} most common allergic sensitizers and risk factors for asthma. To compare exposure levels between workplaces and living areas a new assay able to measure airborne DM antigen concentrations was developed. METHODS: At workplaces and in living areas, 213 floor <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> and 92 <b>personal</b> inhalable <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> were collected. For sensitive quantification of DM antigens, a new enzyme immunoassay (EIA) based on polyclonal antibodies to Dermatophagoides farinae extract was developed. Reactivity of five house dust mite and four storage mite species was tested. All <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> were tested with the new EIA and with the Der f 1 and Der p 1 -EIAs (Indoor Biotechnologies, UK) which detect major allergens from D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus by monoclonal antibodies. Samples below the detection limit in the DM-EIA were retested in an assay variant with a fluorogenic substrate (DM-FEIA). RESULTS: The newly developed DM-EIA detects antigens from all nine tested domestic mite species. It has a lower detection limit of 200 pg/ml of D. farinae protein, compared to 50 pg/ml for the DM-FEIA. DM antigens were detected by DM-EIA/FEIA in all floor dust and 80 (87 %) of airborne samples. Der f 1 was found in 133 (62 %) floor dust and in only 6 airborne samples, Der p 1 was found in 70 (33 %) of floor samples and in one airborne sample. Der f 1 and DM concentrations were highly correlated. DM-antigens were significantly higher in inhalable airborne samples from textile recycling, bed feather filling, feed production, grain storage and cattle stables in comparison to living areas. CONCLUSIONS: A new sensitive EIA directed at DM antigens was developed. DM antigen quantities were well correlated to Der f 1 values and were measurable in the majority (87 %) of airborne <b>dust</b> <b>samples.</b> Some workplaces had significantly higher DM antigen concentrations than living areas...|$|R

In response, the U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) used previously developed Helmet-CAM technology to design and engage in a behavioral/engineering cooperative intervention to initiate and enhance mine site conversations about the risks and potential occurrences of respirable silica dust exposures on the job as well as provide impetus and solutions for mitigating higher sources of dust. The study involved 48 workers from five mine sites, who agreed to participate between April 2015 and September 2016. Using the Helmet-CAM in this series of longitudinal interventions revealed several exposure trends in respirable silica dust sources and, in many cases, simple quick-fix strategies to reduce their sources. This paper focuses on several specific identified sources of dust that were elevated but could be reduced through basic engineering fixes, low-cost resources, and supportive communication from management to remind and engage workers in protective work practices.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Family {{members of}} {{laboratory}} animal workers {{are at risk}} of developing allergy to laboratory animals. Little is known about the spreading of laboratory animal allergens outside the animal facilities. OBJECTIVE: To assess the presence of laboratory animal allergens in dust collected from mattresses of laboratory animal workers and unexposed controls. METHODS: Mouse and rat urinary proteins were measured in <b>samples</b> of mattress <b>dust</b> collected by laboratory animal workers and unexposed controls. In addition, rat and mouse allergens were determined in extracts of hair-covering caps, used during laboratory animal work, to estimate spreading of allergen through dust captured on hair. Allergen concentrations on hair caps were compared with exposure measured by <b>personal</b> airborne <b>dust</b> <b>sampling.</b> RESULTS: Levels of rat urinary allergens (RUA) and mouse urinary allergens (MUA) and mouse urinary protein (MUP) 8, a specific pheromone-binding mouse allergen, were significantly higher in mattress samples of laboratory animal workers than in those of controls. Hair-covering caps used in animal facilities harboured large amounts of RUA and MUA, which correlated significantly with exposure measured by the personal sampling technique in the animal facility. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational laboratory animal allergens are detectable in mattress dust of laboratory animal workers. Transfer of allergens via uncovered hair of animal workers is likely contributing to this phenomenon. This study stresses the importance of using hair caps to prevent spreading of occupational allergen...|$|R
40|$|This study aims at {{estimating}} {{variability in}} exposure to respirable dust and assessing whether the a priori grouping by job team {{is appropriate for}} an exposure–response study on respiratory effects among workers in a manually operated coal mine in Tanzania. Furthermore, estimated exposure levels were used to calculate cumulative exposure. Full-shift <b>personal</b> respirable <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> (n = 204) were collected from 141 randomly chosen workers at underground and surface work sites. The geometric mean exposure for respirable dust varied from 0. 07 mg m 3 for office workers to 1. 96 mg m 3 for the development team. The analogous range of respirable quartz exposure was 0. 006 – 0. 073 mg m 3. Variance components were estimated using random effect models. For most job teams the within-worker variance component was considerably higher than the between-worker variance component. For respirable dust the estimated attenuation of the linear exposure–response relationship was low (5. 9 %) when group-ing by job team. Grouping by job team was considered appropriate for studying the association between current dust exposure and respiratory effects. Based on the estimated worker-specific mean exposure in the job teams, the arithmetic mean cumulative exposure for the 299 workers {{who participated in the}} epidemiological part of the study was 38. 1 mg · yr m 3 for respirable dust and 2. 0 mg · yr m 3 for quartz...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Background: Tailings dam {{workers are}} exposed to {{tailings}} dust that has a potential health risk due to the element contents in the dust. The extent of exposure of tailings dam workers is unknown. Consequently, the elements, level of exposure, the potential adverse effects to health, compliance to legislative requirements and {{the efficiency of the}} current control measures were investigated. Design and Method: During the trials, 69 <b>personal</b> <b>dust</b> <b>samples</b> were collected during three full production shifts from tailings dam workers in three different tailings dam environments. The field filters were weighed to calculate the total <b>dust</b> concentrations. Bulk <b>samples</b> and field filters were analysed using the 32 -element and particle size distribution scans. The between-dam, between-days and between-group variances were determined to assess the changes in exposure levels. Results: The tailings dam workers were not overexposed to tailings dust. Mean exposures were below the OEL for PNOC, measuring 0, 124 mg/m 3 (TD 1) 0, 366 mg/m 3 (TD 2) and 2, 956 mg/m 3 (TD 3). Three outliers in the data were present in TD 3 and exceeded the action level for PNOC. A major part of the particle size distribution consisted of inhalable sizes (>I 0 μm). Cyclone tailings dams have smaller particle sizes than spigot tailings dams, though 85 % of the particles in all tailings dams were larger than 10 μm. Some elements identified in the dust have potential respiratory health effects. No significant differences existed between the three tailings dams regarding tailings dust concentrations (p= 0, 527 on 5 % significant level and p= 0, 292 on 10 % significant level). There was, however, a significant difference on a 5 % significant level between the days (p= 0, 003 and p= 0, 006). The workers on the cyclone tailings dams had smaller exposures than workers on the spigot tailings dams, and the pipeline labourers were more exposed than the mudguards. The tailings dams did comply with legislative control measures. However, washing facilities for the cleaning of overalls due to elements in the dust, such as nickel, chromium and manganese need to be considered. Workers need to be educated in work practices and procedures, personal hygiene and symptoms that can be experienced after exposure. Engineering control measures such as water sprayers covering the entire tailings dam, the use of fixed or temporary windscreens in the area where work is done and covering of the roads on the tailings dam with gravel or water spray can be considered as dust suppressant controls. Conclusion: The study met the issues set out in chapter 1, hypotheses were rejected and accepted and future studies were suggested. Master...|$|R
