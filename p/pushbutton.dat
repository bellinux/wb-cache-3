5|$|Shadows Fall {{was formed}} in 1995 by guitarists Jonathan Donais and Matt Bachand, then good friends from the local music scene. Bachand had {{previously}} been {{a founding member of}} a death metal band and Donais a member of the metalcore band Aftershock. By 1996 the band had found a complete lineup with the addition of Damien McPherson (vocals), Mark Laliberte (bass), and David Germain (drums). Also in 1996, Adam Dutkiewicz performed live drums to fill in for Germain. By late 1996, the band recorded and released a demo titled Mourning a Dead World, of which only about 200 copies were produced. It consisted of the songs Lifeless, Suffer the Season, Fleshold, Forever Lost, A Souls Salvation, and Deadworld. McPherson decided to leave the band, and was replaced by Philip Labonte in 1997. Around the same time, bass guitarist Paul Romanko, formally of the hardcore band <b>Pushbutton</b> Warfare, was recruited as a permanent replacement for Laliberte, who had originally joined on a temporary basis. Now with a more solid lineup, the band released its first EP, To Ashes, with Dutkiewicz playing as a session drummer. The band's name, according to Bachand, comes from the title of a comic book published in the early 1990s.|$|E

25|$|A switch selects the Trigger Source. It {{can be an}} {{external}} input, one of the vertical channels of a dual or multiple-trace oscilloscope, or the AC line (mains) frequency. Another switch enables or disables Auto trigger mode, or selects single sweep, if provided in the oscilloscope. Either a spring-return switch position or a <b>pushbutton</b> arms single sweeps.|$|E
25|$|Dual flush toilets {{allow the}} user to select between a flush for urine or feces, saving a {{significant}} amount of water over conventional units. The flush handle on some of these toilets is pushed up for one kind of flush and down for the other. In other designs, a segmented flush <b>pushbutton</b> is used; pressing the smaller section releases less water.|$|E
25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} {{might have}} come into more common use {{as a means of}} attempting driver-to-driver communication by the mid-1970s, when cars began to come with headlight beam selectors located on the steering column—typically activated by pulling the turn signal stalk—rather than the previous foot-operated <b>pushbutton</b> switches. The signal stalk configuration was later wired to permit the momentary activation of the high beams regardless of whether the headlamp switch was turned on or off.|$|E
40|$|Campbell Pedestrian Safety systems {{produces}} <b>pushbuttons</b> for crosswalks. APS {{systems like}} those developed by Campbell give auditory cues to assist blind and vision impaired pedestrians to safely cross. The bodies of these <b>pushbuttons</b> {{are composed of}} two layers, housing the motor, circuitry, and a chamber where the button itself is depressed. Failure was observed when six <b>pushbuttons</b> in five locations stopped responding to touch. One failed in Kansas City, Kansas, while the five others failed within {{a few miles of}} each other in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region. Buttons were reportedly “packed” with a white powder, and others were heavy with water when received by Campbell. The nature of the failure was clearly corrosion, but a thorough analysis of where and how failure occurred would {{be the best way to}} prevent it in the future. Samples were disassembled and extensively photographed, with powders collected for analysis. Speculation was made about the causes of the corrosion and steps that could prevent it in the future...|$|R

25|$|The 1962 Valiant {{was given}} a {{completely}} new instrument cluster. Like that of the larger 1962 Plymouth models, the new Valiant cluster was highly regarded for its clean design and easy readability. A large round speedometer was placed at {{the left of the}} cluster, with separate round gauges for fuel level, engine temperature, and charging system condition (amperes) in a row {{to the right of the}} speedometer. Automatic transmission <b>pushbuttons</b> were in a column at the left edge of the panel, and heater <b>pushbuttons</b> were in a column at the right edge. A new shallower-dish steering wheel was also introduced.|$|R
25|$|Canon EF lenses, {{introduced}} in 1987, have electromagnetic diaphragms, {{eliminating the need}} for a mechanical linkage between the camera and the lens, and allowing automatic aperture control with the Canon TS-E tilt/shift lenses. Nikon PC-E perspective-control lenses, {{introduced in}} 2008, also have electromagnetic diaphragms. Automatic aperture control is provided with the newer Nikon digital SLR cameras; with some earlier cameras, the lenses offer preset aperture control by means of a <b>pushbutton</b> that controls the electromagnetic diaphragm.|$|E

25|$|Several {{factors were}} {{incorporated}} into the compact Nash Rambler's marketing mix that including making the most from the limited steel supplies during the Korean War, {{as well as the}} automaker selecting a strategy for profit maximization from the new Rambler line. The new Nash Rambler came only in a convertible body, a style that had a higher price in the marketplace and incorporating more standard features that make the open top models suitable more for leisure-type use than ordinary transportation. With a base price of $1,808 (equivalent to approximately $ in today's funds), the Nash Rambler was priced slightly lower than the base convertible models from its intended competition. To further increase the value to buyers, the Nash Rambler was well equipped compared to the competition and included numerous items as standard equipment such as whitewall tires, full wheel covers, electric clock, and even a <b>pushbutton</b> AM radio that were available at extra cost on all other cars at that time.|$|E

2500|$|Changes for the 1975 {{model year}} Gremlins {{included}} standard electronic ignition developed by Prestolite. All U.S. market Gremlins featured catalytic converters {{that required the}} use of unleaded regular-grade fuel. [...] "Unleaded Fuel Only" [...] warnings were placed by the fuel filler and on the fuel gauge. Gremlins with I6 engines and manual transmissions gained a new option, the electrically operated overdrive from Laycock de Normanville.

2500|$|For 1985, Grand Prix's now {{included}} a new checkerboard grille design, {{as well as}} an optional two tone paint scheme with a fading body stripe. The octagonal 'GP' logo also returned to the taillights. 1985 marked the last year for the flat rear deck panel in the interior, as by 1986 laws mandated cars to have a third brake light installed. New rectangular digital ETR stereo system options were introduced and replaced the dial <b>pushbutton</b> stereos. Some more rarer options specific for the 1985 Pontiac Grand Prix include a factory rear spoiler, rare aluminum turbo finned wheels, and a full size spare tire. The standard engine for 1985 was the [...] Buick built 3.8L V6 with a [...] Chevy 5.0L V8 optional. The 5.7L Olds Diesel V8 was dropped from the option list.

2500|$|The Teletouch <b>pushbutton</b> {{automatic}} transmission selector {{was an extremely}} complex feature. [...] It proved problematic {{in part because the}} steering wheel hub, where the pushbuttons were located, was the traditional location of the horn button. [...] Some drivers inadvertently shifted gears when they intended to sound the horn. [...] While the Edsel was fast, the location of the transmission pushbuttons was not conducive to street racing. There were also jokes among stoplight drag racers about the buttons: D for Drag, L for Leap, and R for Race (instead of Drive, Low and Reverse). [...] The control wires for Teletouch were also routed too close to the exhaust manifold, which often caused unpredictable movement of the selector mechanism and, in some cases, complete failure. The electrical design required drivers to shift from Park to Reverse to Neutral to Drive, in that order, to avoid overloading the Teletouch motor. The motor was also not powerful enough to bring the car out of Park while on a hill, so dealerships would instruct drivers to set the parking brake before pushing the Park button.|$|E
2500|$|For some lenses, {{including}} a few long telephotos, lenses mounted on bellows, and perspective-control and tilt/shift lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical, and automatic aperture control was not provided. [...] Many such lenses incorporated a feature {{known as a}} [...] "preset" [...] aperture, which allows the lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working aperture and full aperture without looking at the aperture control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working aperture for metering, return to full aperture for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset aperture controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens aperture rings, with one ring setting the aperture and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture. [...] Examples of lenses {{with this type of}} preset aperture control are the Nikon PC Nikkor 28mm 3.5 and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75mm 4.5. [...] The Nikon PC Micro-Nikkor 85mm 2.8D lens incorporates a mechanical <b>pushbutton</b> that sets working aperture when pressed and restores full aperture when pressed a second time.|$|E

50|$|The first Torqueflites {{provided}} three speeds forward plus reverse. Gear ratios were 2.45:1 in first, 1.45 in second, and 1.00 in third. The transmission {{was controlled}} {{by a series of}} <b>pushbuttons</b> located on the vehicle's dashboard. The buttons were generally at the extreme driver's side end of the dash, i.e., the left in left-hand drive vehicles, and the right in right-hand drive ones. However, this was not always the case; the 1962 Dodge Phoenix, a right-hand drive export model sold in Australia and South Africa, used the U.S. 1962 Plymouth Valiant instrument cluster assembly, into the left end of which were integrated the transmission <b>pushbuttons.</b> Button arrangement varied by vehicle model and year; sequence was Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Second, and First, from top to bottom with vertically arrayed buttons, from left to right with horizontally arrayed buttons, and clockwise starting at upper left with clustered buttons.|$|R
