40|$|AbstractIntroductionIn two solanezumab {{trials for}} mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, 27 % of {{patients}} had biomarker confirmation of amyloid status. Of these, approximately 25 % of mild patients and approximately 10 % of moderate patients were amyloid negative and, as a group, did not exhibit clinical progression typical of AD. This post-hoc analysis describes a statistical surrogate for amyloid status. MethodsQuantile regression {{was used to}} examine solanezumab treatment effects at fixed <b>percentiles</b> of varying degrees of clinical progression, with lowest <b>percentiles</b> (minimal progression atypical of AD) and higher <b>percentiles</b> acting as surrogates for amyloid negativity or positivity, respectively. ResultsIn mild patients, solanezumab treatment effect was greater in higher <b>percentiles</b> of progression and less in lowest <b>percentiles</b> (AD-atypical). In moderate patients, solanezumab did not show effects across most <b>percentiles.</b> DiscussionResults are compatible with design of the ongoing solanezumab EXPEDITION 3 trial that limits patients to those with mild AD dementia and evidence of amyloid pathology...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Physical {{therapists}} frequently use the 66 -item Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM- 66) {{with the}} Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) to examine gross motor function {{in children with}} cerebral palsy (CP). Until now, reference <b>percentiles</b> for this measure were not available. The {{aim of this study}} was to improve the clinical utility of this gross motor measure by developing cross-sectional reference <b>percentiles</b> for the GMFM- 66 within levels of the GMFCS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 1, 940 motor measurements from 650 children with CP were used to develop <b>percentiles.</b> These observations were taken from a subsample, stratified by age and GMFCS, of those in a longitudinal cohort study reported in 2002. A standard LMS (skewness-median-coefficient of variation) method was used to develop cross-sectional reference <b>percentiles.</b> RESULTS: Reference curves were created for the GMFM- 66 by age and GMFCS level, plotted at the 3 rd, 5 th, 10 th, 25 th, 50 th, 75 th, 90 th, 95 th, and 97 th <b>percentiles.</b> The variability of change in children 2 ̆ 7 s <b>percentiles</b> over a 1 -year interval also was investigated. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The reference <b>percentiles</b> extend the clinical utility of the GMFM- 66 and GMFCS by providing for appropriate normative interpretation of GMFM- 66 scores within GMFCS levels. When interpreting change in <b>percentiles</b> over time, therapists must carefully consider the large variability in change that is typical among children with CP. The use of <b>percentiles</b> should be supplemented by interpretation of the raw scores to understand change in function as well as relative standing...|$|R

40|$|In many {{simulation}} {{studies the}} performance of the modeled system is characterized only by mean values of the performance indices. However, the <b>percentiles</b> are more informative in summarizing the performance. Several simultaneous <b>percentiles,</b> presented for example {{in the form of the}} boxplot, provide the analyst with better understanding of the system's behaviour. The simultaneous estimation of several <b>percentiles</b> is a cumbersome task. The extended P 2 -algorithm proposed in this study significantly reduces the computation of the estimation.

40|$|Abstract—In networking, {{enterprise}} computing {{and many}} other areas the issue of adding <b>percentiles</b> of a performance metric, such as the response time, arises regularly. <b>Percentiles</b> cannot be added using the arithmetic sum, and surprisingly there are no known formulae that permit us to do so correctly. In this paper, we obtain an exact analytical expression for adding <b>percentiles</b> of random variables which can be represented {{by a series of}} generalized exponential stages (e. g., Erlang, hypoexponential and two-stage Coxian). We demonstrate the applicability of our results by an example in which we use our expressions in the Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the shortest ’percentile delay’ path.

Design and setting: Cross-sectional population-based study of 2. 53 million singleton live births of infants born in Australia between 1998 and 2007. Main outcome measures: Birthweight <b>percentiles</b> by gestational age and sex. Results: Between 1998 and 2007 women in Australia {{gave birth to}} 2, 539, 237 live singleton births. Of these, 2, 537, 627 had gestational age between 20 and 44 weeks and non-missing sex and birthweight.

Since the publication of the previous Australian birthweight <b>percentiles</b> in 1999, median birthweight for term babies has increased between 0 and 25 g for boys and between 5 and 45 g for girls. Conclusions: There has been only a small increase in birthweight <b>percentiles</b> for babies of both sexes and most gestational ages since 1991 - 1994.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the distribution of}} prices and consumer welfare change {{with the number of}} competitors in a model where consumers differ in the amount of price information they have.

We next provide a suffi cient condition for all price <b>percentiles</b> to decline. In such a situation, some <b>percentiles</b> fall more than others, which leads to asymmetric consumer welfare gains from increased competition.

40|$|An {{assessment}} of regional similarity in catchment stream response is often needed for accurate predictions in ungauged catchments. However, {{it is not}} clear whether similarity among catchments is preserved at all flow conditions. We address this question through the analysis of flow duration curves for 25 gauged catchments located across four river basins in the northeast United States. The coefficient of variation of streamflow <b>percentiles</b> is used as a measure of variability among catchments across flow conditions. Results show that similarity in catchment stream response is dynamic and highly dependent on flow conditions. Specifically, within each of the four basins, the coefficient of variation is high at low flow <b>percentiles</b> and gradually reduces for higher flow <b>percentiles.</b> Analysis of the inter-annual variation in streamflow <b>percentiles</b> shows a similar reduction in variability from low flow to high flow <b>percentiles.</b> Greater similarity in streamflows is observed during the winter and spring (wet) seasons compared to the summer and fall (dry) seasons. Results suggest that the spatial variability in streamflow at low flows is primarily controlled by the dominance of high evaporative demand during the warm period. On the other hand, spatial variability at high flows during the cold period is controlled by the increased dominance of precipitation input over evapotranspiration. By evaluating variability over the entire range of streamflow <b>percentiles,</b> this work explores the nature of hydrologic similarity from a seasonal perspective...|$|R
