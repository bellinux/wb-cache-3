As every year, the National Reference Laboratories are obliged to provide control data from each slaughterhouse. Similar to previous years, the control data received for 2013 are rather heterogeneous. This time a more detailed evaluation of all submitted data took place with focus on plausibility of the data. Where possible reported numbers were recalculated. Furthermore, the data were sorted and evaluated according to the applied chilling methods, types of poultry cuts {{as well as on}} over-the-limit cases and on imports from non-EU countries. JRC.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that each year more than 2 million people suffer from diarrheal diseases, resulting from the consumption of contaminated meat. Foodborne infections are most frequently caused by small Gram-negative rods Campylobacter. The hosts of these bacteria are mainly birds wherein {{they are part of}} the normal intestinal flora. During the commercial slaughter, there is a likelihood of contamination of carcasses by the bacteria found in the intestinal content. In Europe, up to 90 % of poultry flocks can be a reservoir of the pathogen. According to the European Food Safety Authority report from 2015, the number of reported and confirmed cases of human campylobacteriosis exceeds 200 thousands per year, and such trend remains at constant level for several years. The occurrence of growing antibiotic resistance in bacteria forces the limitation of antibiotic use in the animal production. Therefore, the European Union allows only using stringent preventive and hygienic treatment on farms. Achieving Campylobacter free chickens using these methods is possible, but difficult to implement and expensive. Utilization of bacterial viruses – bacteriophages, can be a path to provide the hygienic conditions of poultry production and food processing. Formulations applied in the food protection should contain strictly lytic bacteriophages, be non-pyrogenic and retain long lasting biological activity. Currently, on the market there are available commercial bacteriophage preparations for agricultural use, but neither includes phages against Campylobacter. However, papers on the application of bacteriophages against Campylobacter in chickens and poultry products were published in the last few years. In accordance with the estimates, 2 -logarithm reduction of Campylobacter in <b>poultry</b> <b>carcases</b> will contribute to the 30 -fold reduction in the incidence of campylobacteriosis in humans. Research on bacteriophages against Campylobacter have cognitive and economic importance. The paper presents current state of research on bacteriophages targeted against Campylobacter...|$|E

40|$|Food borne diseases, {{and more}} {{especially}} diarrheal diseases, {{are an important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} (WHO, 2007). Food borne diseases due to bacteria in the food usually manifest as episodes of gastro-intestinal disease (South African DVS, 2007). Most of food borne illnesses occurring annually are caused mainly by three bacteria; Campylobacter spp., nontyphoidal Salmonella serovars, and pathogenic Escherichia coli, including E. coli O 157 :H 7 (Zhao et al, 2001; Mead, 2004). The prevalence of food borne pathogens and epidemiological knowledge of the extent, sources, and causative factors that lead to food borne illness remain unknown {{in many parts of the}} world. In most developing countries data are not collected on such a basis that an assessment of the amount of illness or the causes can be made, but food borne illness is probably second only to malnutrition as the cause of death among children (Lund et al, 2000). In Mozambique the situation is similar to other developing countries. The risk of eating poultry meat from formal and informal small scale producers processed in the formal abattoirs and at informal points of slaughter is unknown. However, the diarrheal diseases remain an important cause of mortalities according to data from the Mozambique National Ministry of Health. The objective of the study were to investigate and describe the value chains for small scale poultry production in Maputo, indicating possible stages at which there was the risk of a hazard that would influence the final product and estimate the magnitude of this risk by using microbiological risk assessment in poultry meat. It included the informal and formal producers and processors. In the study area it was estimated that only 40 % of total poultry production was processed in the formally abattoirs. The remaining 47 % were sold live and 13 % processed by informal processors at point of sale if the customer asked for the fowl to be slaughtered. The method used was participatory risk analysis. The participants included state veterinary services, municipal health authorities, poultry farmers, poultry processors and vendors at live bird markets in Maputo. To quantify the magnitude and nature of the risks, microbiological risk assessment was used on water, equipment surfaces and hands of operatives (as a prerequisite to HACCP) and <b>poultry</b> <b>carcases</b> (at identified CCP’s during the slaughter and dressing of fowls). Samples of poultry carcasses, water and swabs from surfaces and hands of operatives, were taken from poultry farms, live bird markets and poultry abattoirs. The samples were sent for laboratory examination where the tests included E. coli and Coliform Count and Aerobic Plate Count to verify if the carcasses were produced in a hygienic manner and if the poultry processing was controlled adequately. The quality of the poultry carcasses collected from the three sectors was not satisfactory. Poultry meat from formal abattoirs was not found to be much safer than meat purchased at live bird markets and farms using informal slaughtering processes. To improve prerequisites, Hygiene Management Systems (HMS) and Hygiene Assessment Systems (HAS), using an appropriate audit system tailored to the type of processing (ie formal or informal) was proposed for all three value chains with a focus on critical control points.

40|$|During {{the course}} of the work {{reported}} in this thesis, more than 2, 000 samples and isolates from animals and from humans, were examined for the presence of intestinal thermophilic Campylobacter. This figure does not include samples and isolates examined during {{the course of}} experimental studies. Culture of either rectal swabs from pigs or cloacal swabs from poultry usually provides an accurate assessment of the prevalence of distal gastro-intestinal (G. I.) tract infection by C. coli and C. jejuni, provided that the swabs are kept at 4 °C and cultured within 6 hours. Cultures of isolates of C. jejuni can be preserved for at least 21 months if stored in FBP broth or PBS at - 70 °C. The major site of colonisation by C. coli in pigs, is the distal part of the G. I. tract and the proximal G. I tract in the case of C. jejuni. In poultry, the major sites of colonisation by both C. jejuni and C. coli are the distal ileum and the large intestine, especially the caeca. Surveys of pigs showed that 60 - 100 % of post weaning pigs are infected with C. coli. In neonates the rates of infection increase with age, and infected sows are the major source of infection for piglets. C. jejuni is rarely isolated from pigs. Twenty eight percent (28 %) of all poultry flocks examined were infected with intestinal thermophilic Campylobacter. In infected broiler flocks the rate of infection is almost 100 %, while in older birds lower rates were found. Of all the isolates examined, 86 % were C. jejuni and 14 % C. coli. All <b>poultry</b> <b>carcases</b> and edible viscera, derived from infected broiler flocks, are contaminated with Campylobacter. The levels of contamination of these products by both C. jejuni and C. coli are approximately 106 and 104 cfu per whole carcase and packet of edible viscera respectively. Poultry chilled products for sale in supermarkets were also heavily contaminated by these two species Campylobacter which remained viable for the 'shelf life' of the products (ten days). The prevalence of infection by intestinal thermophilic Campylobacter in gulls was 59 %, in ducks 29 %, and in rats 60 %. Infected sparrows were not detected. With the exception of an isolate from one pig, C. laridis is a species apparently host specific for sea birds, and isolates from gulls of what, on conventional taxonomic criteria, would be classified as C. coli are shown on more detailed examination to be C. laridis. The level of excretion in faeces of Campylobacter in most infected pigs is between 102 - 105 cfu/g, in poultry approximately 108 cfu/g, in rats 105 cfu/g, and in gulls 103 cfu/g. The infectivity of C. jejuni isolated from poultry for experimental chickens is in the region of 5 x 102 cfu and that of C. coli approximately 5 x 105. Both species of Campylobacter were a 100 to 1000 -fold less infective for rats. Infection in both chickens and rats was self-limiting and attempts to reinfect chickens with the same species or organism, were usually unsuccessful. C. laridis was not infective for either chickens or rats at dose rates of up to 109 organisms. Campylobacter infections are the most common notified human enteric infection in New Zealand with an annual incidence rate of 31 / 100, 000. Approximately 94 % of the human cases of campylobacteriosis are due to C. jejuni and 6 % to C. coli. People between 1 to 4, and 15 to 35 years of age are the most commonly affected, and patients who no longer have clinical signs of infection may shed up to 108 cfu of C. jejuni/g of faeces. By use of a bacterial restriction endonuclease DNA technique (BRENDA), up to 80 different types C. jejuni and C. coli were identified from 338 isolates from humans. One hundred and ninety four (61 %) of the 316 isolates of C. jejuni from humans had similar BRENDA patterns to isolates of C. jejuni from animals. Poultry appear to be the major source of C. jejuni, and possibly C. coli, for humans, while pigs apparently are an insignificant source of C. coli for humans. Rats can be infected with strains of C. jejuni which can infect poultry, humans and other animals. BRENDA types recovered from gulls and ducks were not similar to any of the isolates from humans or other animals examined. Some strains of C. jejuni and C. coli developed an in-vitro resistance to nalidixic acid. This is an important finding in relation to conventional taxonomic criteria for differentiating C. laridis from other intestinal thermophilic Campylobacter. Isolates of 'C. coli' from gulls are phenotypic variants of C. laridis which may be either resistant, or non resistant, to nalidixic acid. Only by determining whether or not, anaerobic growth in the presence of TMAO occurs, can C. coli be differentiated from C. laridis...|$|E
