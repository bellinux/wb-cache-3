5|$|In the meanwhile, the Singh haveli {{is under}} a debt to Chopra (Nagesh Kukunoor), a local factory owner. When Randhir {{requests}} him for more time to repay it, he is given an offer — pardoning the debt in exchange for Meera. Though initially set back by Chopra's offer, Randhir <b>prefers</b> <b>the</b> haveli to Meera.|$|E
5|$|In several passages, {{he gives}} proof of {{independent}} observation (XXXIV:38, 46, 63, XXXV:17, 20, 116 seq.). He <b>prefers</b> <b>the</b> marble Laocoön and his Sons {{in the palace}} of Titus (widely {{believed to be the}} statue that is now in the Vatican) to all the pictures and bronzes in the world (XXXVI:37). The statue is attributed by Pliny to three sculptors from the island of Rhodes: Agesander, Athenodoros (possibly son of Agesander) and Polydorus.|$|E

5000|$|In voting theory, the micromega rule holds that, when {{political}} parties choose electoral systems, [...] "the large <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> small and <b>the</b> small <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> large". The term [...] "micromega" [...] references Micromégas, a tale by Voltaire in which dwarfs and giants dialogue.|$|R
50|$|Consumption of peaches within China has {{increased}} with marked preferences, people in Shanghai <b>preferring</b> <b>the</b> sweet and juicy variety, while Beijing people <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> hard-flesh sourish variety. Canned peaches are also becoming popular in urban areas, yellow peaches being <b>the</b> <b>preferred</b> variety for canning.|$|R
5|$|Gadret rode {{both the}} Giro and the Tour in 2010, an {{arrangement}} {{which resulted in}} some controversy when he refused to grant Roche, the squad's leader for the race, his wheel after the Irishman had punctured at a particularly inopportune time. This coupled with Gadret's recuperation after the extremely difficult Giro, and his admission that he <b>prefers</b> <b>the</b> Italian Grand Tour in any event, led to speculation {{as to whether the}} two would both be named to the squad. He claimed he would ride only to support Roche, if he rode at all. Lavenu stated that Gadret's impressive Giro had grown his standing with the team, and that the feud between him and Roche had been forgotten, so he hoped Gadret would ride the Tour. Confident of his recovery abilities, Gadret did indeed start the Tour.|$|E
5|$|Gannon {{has also}} been called a 'tactical maverick' due to his unusual {{formations}}. These formations include 3–4–1–2, 4–3–2–1, 4–1–2–3, and his preferred set-up of 4–2–3–1. He has stated that he prefers formations that use four lines of players (as opposed to three lines in the classic 4–4–2) due to the added depth in defence and presence in midfield, and was inspired to use the formations by Carlo Ancelotti. He has also stated that he <b>prefers</b> <b>the</b> 4–3–3 formation to the 4–4–2 formation, and has criticised the way he perceives 4–4–2 to be 'ingrained in the culture' of English football. He {{is known to be}} extremely thorough and meticulous in preparing his players for games.|$|E
5|$|Show {{producers}} {{removed a}} sketch {{which would include}} a rape joke upon Carter's discovery of his daughter, Lois, with her secret family on the southern plantation. Unlike past requests to cut and/or alter jokes, this was not one imposed by the broadcast standards and practices; this was done on the writers' own accord. The sequence showing Peter's silent film star ancestor being stabbed in a card fight was omitted from television broadcasting to save time. Near {{the end of the}} episode, the Griffins are shown arguing over the quality of The Godfather; this scene is drawn from an actual argument that has taken place in the Family Guy writing room over its quality. MacFarlane <b>prefers</b> <b>The</b> 'Burbs and The Money Pit, both of which were received very poorly. Adolf Hitler talking to his wife about his annoyance at Peter Hitler was also removed from television broadcasting for timing purposes.|$|E

25|$|The gauche {{effect is}} very {{sensitive}} to solvent effects, due to the large difference in polarity of the two conformers. For example, 2,3-dinitro-2,3-dimetylbutane, which in the solid state exists only in the gauche conformation, <b>prefers</b> <b>the</b> gauche conformer in benzene solution by a ratio of 79:21, but in carbon tetrachloride it <b>prefers</b> <b>the</b> anti conformer by a ratio of 58:42. Another case is trans-1,2 difluorocyclohexane, which has a larger preference for the eq/eq conformer in more polar solvents.|$|E

The {{remainder of this}} article will use the Wp notation.|$|R

50|$|It is {{commonly}} {{found that people}} <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> sure option when the options are framed as gains (program A) and the risky option when they are framed as losses (program D), {{despite the fact that}} the expected values for all the programs are equivalent. This is in contrast to a normative point of view that would indicate that if respondents <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> sure option in the positive frame, they should also <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> sure option in the negative frame.|$|R
5000|$|The items {{could be}} divided in several ways: some {{divisions}} were equitable (e.g., giving each partner {{a value of}} 45), while other divisions were Pareto efficient (e.g., giving one partner 46 and another partner 75). The interesting question was whether people <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> equitable or the efficient division. The results showed that people <b>preferred</b> <b>the</b> more efficient division, but {{only as long as}} it was not [...] "too much" [...] unfair. A difference of 2-3 units of value was considered sufficiently small for most subjects, so they <b>preferred</b> <b>the</b> efficient allocation. But a difference of 20-30 units (such as in the 45:45 vs. 46:75 example) was perceived as too large: 51% <b>preferred</b> <b>the</b> 45:45 division.|$|R

25|$|Scelophysa trimeni is {{endemic to}} South Africa. This is unsurprising {{considering}} that 69% of all monkey beetle species {{can be found}} in South Africa, and of them 98% are endemic. S. trimeni <b>prefers</b> <b>the</b> sandy and coastal regions of Namaqualand, such as Knersvlakte and Port Nolloth, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Karma yoga is {{discussed}} in many other Hindu texts. For example, the section 11.20 of the Bhagavata Purana states {{that there are only}} three means to spiritual liberation: jnana yoga (knowledge), karma yoga (action) and bhakti yoga (devotion). Those who are of philosophical bent, <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> [...] "knowledge path". Those who are inclined to productive application of arts, skills and knowledge, <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> [...] "karma path". Those who prefer emotional connection, <b>prefer</b> <b>the</b> [...] "devotional path". These three paths overlap, with different relative emphasis.|$|R

25|$|The term {{analgesic}} nephropathy usually refers to damage induced by {{excessive use of}} combinations of these medications, specifically combinations that include phenacetin.
