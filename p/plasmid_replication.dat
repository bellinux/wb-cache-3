2500|$|Coiled-coil α helices {{are highly}} stable forms {{in which two}} or more helices wrap around {{each other in a}} [...] "supercoil" [...] structure. Coiled coils contain a highly {{characteristic}} sequence motif known as a heptad repeat, in which the motif repeats itself every seven residues along the sequence (amino acid residues, not DNA base-pairs). The first and especially the fourth residues (known as the a and d positions) are almost always hydrophobic; the fourth residue is typically leucine this gives rise to the name of the structural motif called a leucine zipper, which is a type of coiled-coil. These hydrophobic residues pack together in the interior of the helix bundle. In general, the fifth and seventh residues (the e and g positions) have opposing charges and form a salt bridge stabilized by electrostatic interactions. Fibrous proteins such as keratin or the [...] "stalks" [...] of myosin or kinesin often adopt coiled-coil structures, as do several dimerizing proteins. A pair of coiled-coils a four-helix bundle is a very common structural motif in proteins. For example, it occurs in human growth hormone and several varieties of cytochrome. The Rop protein, which promotes <b>plasmid</b> <b>replication</b> in bacteria, is an interesting case in which a single polypeptide forms a coiled-coil and two monomers assemble to form a four-helix bundle.|$|E

Minimal plasmids such as PFF1 are useful for studying the basic mechanisms of <b>plasmid</b> <b>replication</b> and copy number regulation, as there are less superfluous genetic elements which might affect the processes being studied. Several mutants of PFF1 which affect the copy number of the plasmid have been identified. Two such mutants, PFF1cop254D and PFF1cop271C, increase the copy number of PFF1 in E. coli from approximately 39-40 to about 501 and 113 plasmids per cell, respectively. An increase in copy number is useful for genetic engineering applications to increase the production yield of recombinant protein.|$|E

50|$|Most {{plasmids}} {{require a}} plasmid-encoded protein, usually called Rep, {{to separate the}} strands of DNA at the origin of replication (oriV) to initiate DNA replication. Rep binds to specific DNA sequences in oriV which are unique to a plasmid type. The synthesis of Rep protein is controlled in order to limit <b>plasmid</b> <b>replication</b> and therefore regulate copy number.In R1 plasmids RepA can be transcribed from two different promoters. It is made from the first promoter until the plasmid reaches its copy number, upon which the protein CopB represses this primary promoter. RepA expression is also regulated post-transcriptionally from the secondary promoter by an antisense RNA called CopA. CopA interacts with its RNA target in the RepA mRNA and forms a kissing complex and then a RNA-RNA duplex. The resultant double stranded RNA is cleaved by RNase III, preventing synthesis of RepA. The higher the concentration of the plasmid, the more CopA RNA is produced and the less RepA protein can be synthesized, increasing inhibition of <b>plasmid</b> <b>replication.</b>|$|E

40|$|Temperature-sensitive (Ts) mutant {{plasmids}} {{isolated from}} tetracycline resistance R plasmid pSC 101 were investigated for their segregation kinetics and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication. The results fit {{well with the}} hypothesis that multiple copies of a plasmid are distributed to daughter cells in a random fashion and are thus diluted out when {{a new round of}} <b>plasmid</b> DNA <b>replication</b> is blocked. When cells harboring type I mutant plasmids were grown at 43 degrees C in the absence of tetracycline, antibiotic-sensitive cells were segregated after a certain lag time. This lag most likely corresponds to a dilution of plasmids existing prior to the temperature shift. The synthesis of plasmid DNA in cells harboring type I mutant plasmids was almost completely blocked at 43 degrees C. It seems that these plasmids have mutations in the gene(s) necessary for <b>plasmid</b> DNA <b>replication.</b> Cells haboring a type II mutant plasmid exhibited neither segregation due to antibiotic sensitivity nor inhibition of <b>plasmid</b> DNA <b>replication</b> throughout cultivation at high temperature. It is likely that the type II mutant plasmid has a temperature-sensitive mutation in the tetracycline resistance gene. Antibiotic-sensitive cells haboring type III mutant plasmids appeared at high frequency after a certain lag time, and the plasmid DNA synthesis was partially suppressed at the nonpermissive temperature. They exhibited also a pleiotrophic phenotype, such as an increase of drug resistance level at 30 degrees C and a {{decrease in the number of}} plasmid genomes in a cell...|$|R

40|$|RNAII, an RNA species encoded by ColE 1 -type plasmids, {{serves as}} a primer for <b>plasmid</b> DNA <b>replication.</b> Previous work has shown that {{overproduction}} of RNAII transcribed by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase results in elevated plasmid copy number. To produce a plasmid in which the elevation of its copy number is inducible, we placed transcription of RNAII {{under the control of}} a bacteriophage T 7 late promoter regulated by IPTG-inducible T 7 RNA polymerase. During induction of T 7 RNA polymerase by IPTG, we found that RNAII was overexpressed, but that, surprisingly, this increase in RNAII did not result in elevation of plasmid copy number. These results suggest that RNAII transcribed by T 7 RNA polymerase does not function as a primer for <b>plasmid</b> DNA <b>replication.</b> Since RNAII function requires folding of its multiple stem-loop structures in a precise conformation and folding of RNAII can be influenced by its rate of transcription, the extremely rapid rate of travel of the T 7 RNA polymerase may preclude proper folding of RNAII during its elongation...|$|R
50|$|Rolling circle DNA {{replication}} is {{initiated by}} an initiator protein encoded by the plasmid or bacteriophage DNA, which nicks one strand of the double-stranded, circular DNA molecule {{at a site}} called the double-strand origin, or DSO. The initiator protein remains bound to the 5' phosphate end of the nicked strand, and the free 3' hydroxyl end is released {{to serve as a}} primer for DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase III. Using the unnicked strand as a template, replication proceeds around the circular DNA molecule, displacing the nicked strand as single-stranded DNA. Displacement of the nicked strand is carried out by a host-encoded helicase called PcrA (the abbreviation standing for plasmid copy reduced) {{in the presence of the}} <b>plasmid</b> <b>replication</b> initiation protein.|$|E
5000|$|Iteron plasmids, {{including}} F and RK2-related plasmids, have oriV regions containing multiple (~3-7) repeats of 17-22 bp iteron sequences.pSC101 {{represents a}} simple model of an iteron plasmid. Iteron plasmids control copy number through two combined methods, suitable for low copy number stringent plasmids. One method is control of RepA synthesis. RepA {{is the only}} plasmid-encoded protein required for replication in pSC101. RepA protein represses its own synthesis by binding to its own promoter region and blocking transcription of itself (transcriptional autoregulation). Thus, the more RepA is made, the more its synthesis is repressed, and subsequently limiting <b>plasmid</b> <b>replication.</b> The coupling hypothesis proposes that the second method is coupling of plasmids through the Rep protein and iteron sequences. When the plasmid concentration is high, RepA plasmids bound to iterons form dimers in between two plasmids, [...] "handcuffing" [...] them at the origin of replication and inhibiting replication.|$|E
50|$|In ColE1 derived plasmids, {{replication}} {{is primarily}} regulated {{through a small}} plasmid-encoded RNA called RNA I.A single promoter initiates replication in ColE1: the RNA II promoter. Interestingly, the RNA II transcript forms a stable RNA-DNA hybrid with the DNA template strand near the origin of replication, where it is then processed by RNaseH to produce the 3' OH primer that DNA polymerase I uses to initiate leading strand DNA synthesis. RNA I serves as a major plasmid-encoded inhibitor of this process whose concentration is proportional to plasmid copy number. RNA I is exactly complementary to the 5' end of the RNA II (because it is transcribed from the opposite strand of the same region of DNA as RNA II). RNA I and RNA II first form a weak interaction called a kissing complex. The kissing complex is stabilized by a protein called Rop (repressor of primer) and a double-stranded RNA-I/RNA-II RNA duxplex is formed. This altered shape prevents RNA II from hybridizing to the DNA and being processed from RNaseH to produce the primer necessary for initiation of <b>plasmid</b> <b>replication.</b> More RNA I is produced when the concentration of the plasmid is high, and high concentration of RNA I inhibits replication, resulting in regulation of copy number.|$|E
5000|$|Many bacteria, {{including}} E. coli, contain plasmids {{that each}} contain an origin of replication. These are {{separate from the}} origins of replication that are used by the bacteria to copy their genome and often function very differently. For example, the E. coli plasmid pBR322 uses a protein called Rop/Rom to regulate the number of plasmids that are within each bacterial cell [...] The most common origin of replication that is used in plasmids for genetic engineering is called pUC. This origin is derived from pBR322 but it contains two mutations. One single point mutation in the origin itself and another that deletes the Rop/Rom gene. This removes all the regulatory constraints on the <b>plasmids</b> <b>replication</b> and the bacteria then go from producing 30-40 plasmids per cell with pBR322 up to producing over 500 with pUC. This allows genetic engineers to produce large quantities of DNA for research purposes. Other origins of replication include pSC101 (derived from Salmonella, around 5 copies per cell), 15A origin (derived from p15A, 10-20 copies per cell) and Bacterial artificial chromosomes (1 copy per cell).|$|R

In addition the vetors carry the selection marker operational for selection of plasmid carrying bacteria and QMCF cells, bacterial ColE1 origin of replication, and cassette for expression of protein of interest.

Unlike in transient expression system, QMCF Technology enables to maintain episomally replicating QMCF plasmids inside the cells for up to 50 days thus providing an option for production phase of 2-3 weeks. Therefore, the production levels of QMCF Technology are higher (up to 1g/L). Another difference is the option of establishing expression cell banks within one week, which is not feasible with transient system. Compared to usage of stable cell line, QMCF technology is a rapid method leaving out time-consuming clone selection step during cell line development.|$|E
