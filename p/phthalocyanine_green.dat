For an azo dye concentration of 12 mg/L decolouration yields of 78 and 27 % were achieved, respectively, in SBR 2 and SBR 3. For the phthalocyanine dye, the decolouration yields decreased to 24 and 15 %, respectively.

5000|$|Approximately 25% of all {{artificial}} organic pigments are phthalocyanine derivatives. [...] Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) dyes {{are produced}} by introducing solubilizing groups, such as one or more sulfonic acid functions. These dyes find extensive use in various areas of textile dyeing (Direct dyes for cotton), for spin dyeing and in the paper industry. Direct blue 86 is the sodium salt of CuPc-sulfonic acid, whereas direct blue 199 is the quaternary ammonium salt of the CuPc-sulfonic acid. The quaternary ammonium salts of these sulfonic acids are used as solvent dyes because of their solubility in organic solvents, e.g. Solvent Blue 38 and Solvent Blue 48. The dye derived from cobalt phthalocyanine and an amine is Phthalogen Dye IBN. 1,3-Diiminoisoindolene, the intermediate formed during phthalocyanine manufacture, used in combination with a copper salt affords the dye GK 161. Phthalocyanine Blue BN is also used as a source material for manufacture of <b>Phthalocyanine</b> <b>Green</b> G.|$|E
30|$|The {{main object}} of this {{research}} is to provide aluminum pigment colored to the highest chroma by depositing <b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>green</b> G pigment on the surface of aluminum pigment, thereby improving the chroma and avoiding the issue of color fading and exfoliation inherent in conventionally pigment colored aluminum pigments. To achieve these objectives, a colorful pigment (<b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>green</b> G) with inherently high tinctorial strength and excellent fastness to different solvents, heat, light, weathering [15, 25] was chosen and adsorbed onto aluminum pigment having adsorption layer of inorganic acid radical with the green colorful pigment adhered to said adsorption layer. The <b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>green</b> G colored aluminum pigment was then coated with a polymer using radical polymerization, and its properties were investigated. The application of both techniques overcome the limitations of classical polymerization and corrosion inhibition methods and provides an efficient route for preparing colored aluminum pigment having excellent properties.|$|E

40|$|The main {{pigments}} in {{the painting}} by the Chilean artist Ignacio Gumucio were identified by using micro-Raman spectroscopy. Three works by the artist, two paintings with wooden stand and a wall painting were analyzed.

The blue color Raman bands corresponds to cooper <b>phthalocyanine.</b> In the <b>green</b> areas, the Raman signals were ascribed to the azopigment acetoacetic arylide and copper phthalocyanine; the green color is then {{the result of a}} combination of the yellow and blue pigments. Raman bands in the pink areas were assigned to the azopigment beta-naphthol. The dark green color in the Saludo paint is due to a chlorinated copper phthalocyanine pigment. Other materials in the artworks were also identified: rutile (TiO 2) in Saludo in white areas and calcite (CaCO 3) in Mental and Rio.

30|$|Polymer-encapsulated <b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>green</b> {{aluminum}} pigment {{was prepared}} via inorganic acid radical/radical polymerization route, and its properties were investigated by FT-IR, TGA, XPS, SEM, and TEM.

XPS results showed significant chemical shifts, and increase in binding energies to higher levels after raw aluminum pigment was phosphate coated and colored by <b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>green</b> pigment. TGA results suggest a marginal reduction in its thermal stability. Major absorbance peaks, such as aluminum phosphate (AlPO 4), different monomer units and CH 2 stretching vibration of <b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>green</b> G were highlighted in the FTIR spectra of the colored aluminum matrix.

The distribution patterns of total PCDD/Fs and 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted PCDD/Fs were elucidated in detail. The TEQ values of toxic PCDD/Fs in all chemicals were in the range of 5. 03 - 1379. 55 ng I-TEQ/kg. The contribution of OCDD and OCDF in <b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>green</b> was 75 % of the total TEQ. For chloranils, the maximum contribution of toxic PCDD/Fs was from 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted HxCDF and 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted HpCDF. The TEQ of HxCDF and HpCDF in chloranil- 1 was 90 % and in chloranil- 2 was 71 %. And the toxic contribution increased with the degree of chlorination for PCDFs. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|Although at {{a visual}} {{observation}} the green paints {{appear to have}} a similar hue and texture/morphology, thanks to a large number of point measurements collected across the painting surface, two different formulations have been pinpointed. On some of the green paints, XRF measured strong signals of chromium (Fig.  5 a), thus indicating both the possible use of chrome green or viridian (respectively Cr 2 O 3 and its hydrated form Cr 2 O 3 · 2 H 2 O) as well as Cr-based yellow in mixture with a blue. The hydrated form of chromium oxide (here indicated as green 1) has been conclusively identified thanks to UV–Vis-NIR reflection spectroscopy [18]. An example of UV–Vis-NIR profile recorded on green 1 areas is reported in Fig.  5 b in comparison with the reference compound. Another type of green, labelled as green 2, has been easily identified as <b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>green,</b> probably in mixture with anatase, by analyzing its vibrational and electronic spectral properties [25, 26]: in Fig.  5 c, d, examples of Raman and UV–Vis-NIR spectra collected on green 2 areas are compared with those from <b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>green</b> powder.

Besides these chemical shifts, copper phthalocyanine G; denoted as C.G 1 s and phosphate compounds, also denoted as N(PO 3) 2 p 3 were clearly shown in colored <b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>green</b> aluminum pigment (Fig.  2 b) which are conspicuously missing in “as received aluminum pigment”.|$|E

No significant difference {{can be seen}} in the TEM images of as received aluminum pigment (Fig.  3 g), PGAP (Fig.  3 h) and PAP (Fig.  3 i), except what appears to be a smooth layer on the surface of PAP probably due to the encapsulated polymer layer.|$|E

With {{low surface tension}} and high diffusivity of fluids in supercritical states, aggregated particles may be effectively wetted and swelled to form the primary constituent of the dispersing solution by volume. In this paper, the conditions of temperature and pressure are used to control the density of supercritical carbon dioxide subject to PGMEA as cosolvent for dispersing organic powder in a solution. As shown from measurement with a laser scattering particle analyzer, the average diameter of <b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>green</b> 36 with the haloid structure can be significantly reduced to 93. 5 nm; for aminoanthraquinone red containing and amino group (-NH 2) and phthalocyanine blue 15 : 6 with symmetry benzene and inner hydrogen bond, the mean particle sizes are 178. 5 and 188. 7 nm, respectively, using supercritical CO 2. Additionally, the transmittance of UV light is used to confirm the dispersing performance in this study. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{radiography}} {{performed on}} the painting There Is No Yes without a No—The Hermit (1985) by António Dacosta revealed one of his lost works. The last and only record of the lost painting is {{a black and white}} photograph taken during the exhibition L'Artiste du Mois at Centre Culturel Portugais de la Fondation Calouste Gulbenkian in Paris, 1985. The chromatic reconstruction of the artwork would be of extreme importance for its dissemination as it was conceived. For this purpose, portable x-ray fluorescence analyses were carried out directly on the paintings for preliminary elemental identification and to determine the most favorable sampling areas for μ-Raman and SEM–EDS evaluation. Cross sections were observed under optical microscope for better discernment of the chromatic layers used in each painting. In both artworks, titanium white (rutile), Mars red, Mars black, ultramarine blue, phthalocyanine blue and dioxazine violet were identified. Mars yellow and Mars black were found on superficial layers from the latest painting; <b>phthalocyanine</b> <b>green,</b> chrome-based green and cadmium red/orange was found on deeper layers, belonging to the hidden painting...|$|E
