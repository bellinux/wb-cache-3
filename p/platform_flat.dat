5000|$|A {{bucket seat}} is a seat {{contoured}} to hold one person, distinct from bench seats, which are <b>flat</b> <b>platforms</b> designed to seat multiple people. Bucket seats are standard in fast cars to keep drivers and other passengers in place when making sharp or quick turns.|$|R
2500|$|The socialite was {{influenced}} by minister Marty Angelo in jail, referring to a [...] "new beginning" [...] {{in an interview with}} talk-show host Larry King on June 28, 2007 (two days after her release) and quoting from Angelo's autobiography (Once Life Matters: A New Beginning). On June 9, Angelo unsuccessfully petitioned Sauer to let him serve the remainder of Hilton's sentence if the judge would release her to an alternative treatment program. Hilton told King during the interview that she had taken Adderall for ADHD since childhood. Due to her incarceration, The Simple Life finished its run {{at the end of its}} fifth season in July 2007. In early August, Hilton signed a licensing agreement with Antebi for a signature footwear line (Paris Hilton Footwear, featuring stilettos, <b>platforms,</b> <b>flats,</b> wedges and a sports collection) which was expected to reach stores in 2008. In mid-August, she introduced a line of tops, dresses, coats and jeans at the Kitson Boutique in Los Angeles. Hilton called the event [...] "a dream come true", describing the clothing line as [...] "fun, bright and flashy". In December 2007 she posed nude (covered with gold paint) to promote [...] "Rich Prosecco", a canned version of the Italian sparkling wine, traveling to Germany to appear in print ads for the wine.|$|R
50|$|A {{bucket seat}} is a {{separate}} seat with a contoured platform designed to accommodate one person, distinct from a bench seat that is a <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> designed to seat up to three people.

Charles Dunbar {{was regarded as a}} loyal and valued employee.|$|R
50|$|This cuckoo {{is found}} {{primarily}} in mangrove swamps and hammocks. It usually nests 2 - 3 m above {{water in a}} mangrove tree or in a fork of a tree above ground. The nest is a relatively <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> of twigs and leaves. The female lays 2-4 eggs with both adults sharing in feeding the young bird.|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of ultrathin {{layers of}} CdS nanocrystals from cadmium arachidate Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film templates {{has been investigated}} by means of scanning force and scanning electron microscopies (SEM). Consistently with previous Brewster angle microscopy investigations, low resolution electron micrographs reveal a flat film surface characterized by steps due to {{the difference in the}} number of precursor layers. Scanning force microscopy (SFM) allows one to get information on the mesoscopic and atomic film structure. While in the range 1 - 10 mu m the film appears to be formed by a series of <b>flat</b> <b>platforms,</b> often shaped like triangles and sometimes superorganized in larger needle-like structures, in the hundred nanometer scale an irregular granular structure appears. Finally, performing zooms onto <b>flat</b> <b>platforms,</b> the CdS hexagonal lattice appears, revealing a lattice periodicity of 0. 42 nm, in agreement with the bulk value.

30|$|The {{sedimentary}} facies of the Jialingjiang Formation changed obviously {{from west}} to east and was controlled by tectonics and sea level. Sedimentary stage of the TST mainly developed in open platform. During this stage, the eastern and {{central part of the}} basin developed oolitic shoal reservoirs. In the HST, the sedimentary range of restricted platform expanded with strong regression. The northeastern basin during this stage developed good-quality dolomitic reservoirs. Restricted <b>platform</b> dolomite <b>flats</b> and open <b>platform</b> oolitic shoal had algal dolomite and oolitic limestone with relatively well physical properties, and were the major hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir facies belt, which might be the next potential reservoir targets for exploration of the Jialingjiang Formation.|$|R
50|$|The {{soles of}} espadrilles may be <b>flat,</b> <b>platform,</b> or wedge shaped made of natural fiber. Uppers {{may be made}} from nearly any {{substance}} and may have open or closed toes, open or closed backs, and can be slip-on or tied to the ankle with laces. Thousands of varieties of espadrilles can be found, from inexpensive bargain brands to high priced designer brands.|$|R
50|$|Within only a {{short period}} of time a wide variety of special bodies was {{available}} from outside suppliers, with Ford approval for these being confirmed in many cases by their inclusion in the Ford Motor Company's official glossy brochures. Mobile shops, milk floats, ambulances, <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> trucks with generators or compressors and box vans, and the popular pick up trucks all appeared.|$|R

There may also be <b>flat</b> <b>platform</b> {{connected}} to it at the top; this is called the deck. Quarter pipes have [...] "transitions" [...] which is the size of the radius of the ramps riding surface.|$|R

2500|$|... the MinGW and Cygwin {{projects}} {{also provide}} {{such an environment}} based on the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), using a stand-alone header file set, to make linking against the Win32-specific DLLs simple. LCC-Win32 is a C compiler maintained by Jacob Navia, freeware for non-commercial use. Pelles C is a freeware C compiler maintained by Pelle Orinius. Free Pascal is a free software Object Pascal compiler that supports the Windows API. The MASM32 package is a mature project providing support for the Windows API under Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) by using custom made or converted headers and libraries from the <b>Platform</b> SDK. <b>Flat</b> assembler FASM allows building Windows programs without using an external linker, even when running on Linux.|$|R
30|$|Restricted {{platform}} facies {{corresponds to}} a carbonate depositional environment with little terrigenous material. This facies has slightly lower wave energy and relatively higher salinity comparing with the open platform facies. Slightly rise or fall of relative sea level would cause a large area of the platform subarial exposure, which results {{in the development of}} the restricted <b>platform</b> tidal <b>flat.</b> Carbonate grains are prone to occur penecontemporaneous dolomitization under the action of the surface water with high salinity and rich magnesium. The widespread development of tidal flat dolomite is a critical indicator of restricted platform environment in the study area. These facies are developed in the T 1 j 2, T 1 j 4, and T 1 j 5 lithologic sections.|$|R
50|$|The site {{originally}} sloped steeply from Ann Street down to Adelaide Street and was excavated {{to create}} a <b>flat</b> <b>platform.</b> The Ann Street facade is five storeys, with a further two storeys and a mezzanine located below pavement level. In the centre of this facade is a prominent arched portal. This entrance is faced in smooth sandstone and its simplified modern design, without mouldings or banding, contrasts with the external finishes of {{the remainder of the}} building.|$|R
5000|$|Huge {{pointers}} {{are essentially}} far pointers, but are (mostly) normalized {{every time they}} are modified so {{that they have the}} highest possible segment for that address. This is very slow but allows the pointer to point to multiple segments, and allows for accurate pointer comparisons, as if the <b>platform</b> were a <b>flat</b> memory model: It forbids the aliasing of memory as described above, so two huge pointers that reference the same memory location are always equal.|$|R
