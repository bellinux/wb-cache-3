40|$|A large {{percentage}} of patients with HIV/AIDS will develop dermatological complications. Consequently, all practising clinicians and pathologists in regions with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS must {{be familiar with the}} diverse cutaneous manifestations of the disease. This paper highlights the fact that biopsy material in this clinical context may occasionally reveal more than one pathological process. The potential spectrum includes two or more infections in a single skin biopsy (e. g., herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus infection), neoplastic lesions containing infective organisms (Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and cryptococcosis), dermatoses in association with neoplastic lesions (e. g., KS and interface dermatitis), or more than one dermatosis in a given specimen (e. g., <b>papulopruritic</b> <b>eruption</b> and nodular prurigo). Rare biopsies may even demonstrate triple pathology. The importance of careful examination of skin biopsies in this clinical context is emphasised. Failure to recognise an undiagnosed concomitant opportunistic infective pathogen could have potentially disastrous consequences for the patient...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: <b>Papulopruritic</b> <b>eruption</b> (PPE) {{occurs in}} {{people living with}} HIV in India. Understanding the risk factors {{associated}} with this disease may help decrease the prevalence of PPE. Methods: This study was a case-control study performed at the Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine, a tertiary care hospital in Chennai, India. Cases included HIV-positive, antiretroviral (ARV) therapy-na&#x 00 EF;ve adults experiencing a pruritic skin eruption for longer than one month, with evidence of multiple papular or nodular lesions and biopsy consistent with arthropod bite. Controls included HIV-positive, ARV-na&#x 00 EF;ve patients without active skin rash. Main outcome measures were CD 4 cell count, histology, and environmental exposures. We performed statistical analysis using Epi Info version 3. 5. 1 and SPSS version 11. 0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Categorical variables such as gender, urban versus rural residence, occupation, treatment history, CD 4 count, use of insect repellents, and environmental exposures were evaluated using the &#x 03 C 7; 2 test (or the Fisher exact test when an expected value for a category was less than 5). The t-test {{was used to evaluate}} differences in age and the duration since HIV diagnosis. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare non-normally distributed values such as CD 4 cell count. A p-value that was less than 0. 05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: Forty-one cases and 149 control subjects were included. Subjects with PPE had significantly lower CD 4 cell counts compared to controls (225. 5 cells/&#x 00 B 5;L vs. 425 cells/&#x 00 B 5;L; p= 0. 0001). Sixty-six percent of cases had a CD 4 cell count less than 350 cells/&#x 00 B 5;L. PPE cases were less likely to use mosquito repellent techniques (odds ratio 2. 81, CI = 1. 45 &#x 2013; 5. 45). Discussion: PPE may be an altered and exaggerated immune response to arthropod bites in HIV-positive patients. CD 4 cell count is significantly lower in patients with PPE, and therefore it may be considered a qualifying clinical finding for ARV initiation in resource-poor settings. Protective measures against mosquito bites appeared to be important in preventing PPE in subjects at risk...|$|E
