[...] In late October2016, the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo council unanimously voted {{in support of a}} second highway that would serve as an alternate evacuation route, tentatively called the East Clearwater Highway. [...] It would run east of Fort McMurray as an extension of Highway881 near Anzac, crossing the Clearwater River and connecting to a proposed segment of Highway686 before continuing north. [...] The project is estimated to cost $1.5billion, of which $5million was committed by council in 2016 for <b>pre-design</b> work. [...] The road would require provincial funding and the feasibility of its construction was assessed by Notley's government as part of a review of the wildfire evacuation process.|$|E

40|$|Most {{system-on-chip}} (SoC) design methodologies {{promote the}} reuse of <b>pre-designed</b> (hardware, software, and functional) components.

Hence, SoC design and validation involves component composition techniques to create hardware, software, and functional interface sub-systems by assembling basic interface components.

As time progresses beyond the <b>pre-design</b> phase, the CM's ability to effect cost savings diminishes. The agency CM can represent the owner by helping select the design and construction teams and managing the design (preventing scope creep), helping the owner stay within a predetermined budget with value engineering, cost-benefit analysis and best-value comparisons. The software-application field of construction collaboration technology has been developed to apply information technology to construction management.|$|E

5000|$|A CDBMS has two {{drawbacks}} {{in comparison}} to database alternatives. Unlike relational databases, {{which can be used}} in a wide variety of applications, a correlation database is designed specifically for analytical applications and does not provide transaction management features; it cannot be used for transactional processing. Second, because it indexes all data during the load process, the physical load speed of a CDBMS is slower than relational or column-oriented structures. However, because it eliminates the need for logical or physical <b>pre-design,</b> the overall [...] "time to use" [...] of a CDBMS is generally similar to or somewhat faster than alternative structures.|$|E

50|$|A {{property}} owner or {{real estate developer}} develops a program of their needs and select a site (often with an architect). The architect assembles a design team of consulting engineers and other experts to design the building and specify the building systems. Today contractors frequently participate on the design team by providing <b>pre-design</b> services such as providing estimations of the budget and scheduling requirements to improve {{the economy of the}} project. In other cases the general contractor is hired {{at the close of the}} design phase. The owner, architect, and general contractor work closely together to meet deadlines and budget. The general contractor works with subcontractors to ensure quality standards.|$|E
50|$|For {{analytical}} {{data warehouse}} applications, a CDBMS has several advantages over alternative database structures. First, because the database engine itself indexes all data and auto-generates its own schema {{on the fly}} while loading, it can be implemented quickly and is easy to update. There {{is no need for}} physical <b>pre-design</b> and no need to ever restructure the database. Second, a CDBMS enables creation and execution of complex queries such as associative queries ("show everything that is related to x") that are difficult if not impossible to model in SQL. The primary advantage of the CDBMS is that it is optimized for executing ad hoc queries - queries not anticipated during the data warehouse design phase.|$|E

In total, interns must complete 5600 hours of reported experience before attaining professional licensure.

The energy management model is <b>pre-designed</b> by using house construction and electronic devices’ location. The <b>pre-designed</b> model is simple to construct. However, the limitation of <b>pre-designed</b> model does not manage the temporary use of devices. In addition, people may use two different devices that are placed at the separated room at the same time. If the system controls the device only by space divided by the house construction, this simultaneous use is ignored.|$|R
