A <b>presumed</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> occurs where the transfer fails, {{and there is no reason}} to assume it was intended as an outright gift. With some relationships, such as property transfers between father and son and husband and wife, this presumption of advancement is applied by default, and requires strong evidence for it to be rebutted. Presumed resulting trusts do arise, however, in one of three situations: where it is a voluntary gift, where there is a contribution to purchase price, and where the presumption that it was an outright gift can be rebutted. Rules differ for transfers and gifts of personal property and land; while personal property is assumed by default to create a resulting trust, Section 60(3) of the Law of Property Act 1925 prevents the creation of automatic resulting trusts. It does not comment on presumed resulting trusts, and while later law has seemingly permitted such trusts, there is some disagreement.|$|E
2500|$|The last {{situation}} where a <b>presumed</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> is created {{is if the}} court can rebut the presumption of an outright gift. The general philosophy here was set out by James LJ in Fowkes v Pascoe, and is that the judge should base his decision on [...] " [...] story as to how I came to have , and judge that story {{with reference to the}} surrounding facts and circumstances". Where the property is money held in a joint bank account, the presumption {{is that it is a}} joint tenancy of that account. As such, when one dies the property is passed absolutely to the other, as in Marshall v Crutwell. This presumption can be rebutted in several situations. It will be rebutted when the account, while in the name of both the husband and wife, is used exclusively for the husband's personal use, as in Young v Sealey, or where the joint account exists solely so the husband can guarantee the wife's account, as in Anson v Anson. Tax avoidance (which is legal, as opposed to tax evasion) frequently involves transferring property to a family member to avoid tax. Where the family member refuses to transfer it back, the taxpayer can come to court and argue it was a resulting trust.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> in English law are trusts created where {{property}} is not properly disposed of. It {{comes from the}} Latin resultare, meaning to spring back, and was defined by Megarry VC as [...] "essentially a property concept; any property that a man does not effectually dispose of remains his own". These trusts come in two forms: [...] automatic <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts,</b> and <b>presumed</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts.</b> Automatic <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> arise from a [...] "gap" [...] in the equitable title of property. The equitable maxim [...] "equity abhors a vacuum" [...] is followed: it is against principle {{for a piece of}} property to have no owner. As such, the courts assign the property to somebody in a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> to avoid this becoming an issue. They occur in one of four situations: where there is no declaration of trust, where an express trust fails, where there is surplus property, or upon the dissolution of an unincorporated association. Rules differ depending on the situation and the type of original trust under dispute; failed charitable trusts, for example, have the property reapplied in a different way from other forms of trust.|$|R
5000|$|The name <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> {{comes from}} the Latin resultare, meaning to spring back. It was defined in Re Sick and Funeral Society of St John's Sunday School, Golcar, where Megarry VC stated that [...] "A <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> is {{essentially}} a property concept; any property that a man does not effectually dispose of remains his own". In Re Vandervell's Trusts (No 2), he divided them into two categories; <b>presumed</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts,</b> which are created by the presumed intention of the transferor of property, and automatic <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts,</b> which arise regardless of the transferor's intention whenever he has failed {{to dispose of the}} beneficial interest. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, in Westdeutsche Landesbank v Islington London Borough Council, disagreed with Megarry's classification. While he agreed there were two categories, he felt the dividing line was not based on intention, and the classes were [...] "where A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which is vested either in B alone or in the joint names of A and B" [...] and [...] "Where A transfers property to B on express trusts, but the trusts declared do not exhaust the whole beneficial interest", with both involving a presumption of intention. It is possible to argue that Quistclose trusts are also a category of <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts,</b> but their classification is the subject of much debate and remains ambiguous.|$|R
2500|$|Presumed {{resulting}} trusts do arise, however, in one {{of three}} situations; where it is a voluntary gift, where there is a contribution to purchase price, and where the presumption that it was an outright gift can be rebutted. Where a gift is voluntary, the assumption for personal property is that it creates a resulting trust on failure, as in Re Vinogradoff. For real property, Section 60(3) of the Law of Property Act 1925 prevents the creation of automatic resulting trusts, but does not comment on presumed trusts. In Hodgson v Marks, it is generally agreed that a <b>presumed</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> was created over a transfer of real property, although there is some dispute. Where a person contributed to the price of a piece of property, they are presumed to take an equivalent equitable interest in that property; this is the [...] "clearest form of presumed resulting trust", and was recognised by both Browne-Wilkinson in Westdeutsche Landesbank and Megarry in Vandervell (No. 2). These principles originated with Eyre CB's judgment in Dyer v Dyer, where he said that: [...] Thus, where a person contributes to the purchase of the property, they will receive an equivalent equitable interest in any resulting trust that arises. For trusts over homes, a distinct set of rules have arisen that do not apply to other land, because of the additional concerns. For example, while contributing to the mortgage will create an equitable interest, as in Lloyds Bank v Rosset, contributing to domestic expenses will not, as in Burns v Burns. It must also be demonstrated that the contribution was not made for any purpose other than acquiring an equitable interest; in Sekhon v Alissa, for example, a mother transferred a house into her daughter's name to avoid capital gains tax. The court ruled that this created a resulting trust; because tax avoidance was the main objective, the mother could not possibly have intended it to be an outright gift.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} nature of the <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> and its role in the law of restitution. Part One {{examines}} the situations in which <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> arise. Chapters I (Apparent Gifts) and II (Trusts Which Fail) concern the traditional categories of resulting trust; III (Quistclose trusts) and IV (Failure of Consideration) look at <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> which arise when property has been transferred for limited purposes which become incapable of fulfilment. It is concluded that all <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> operate on the same principle, arising when property is transferred to another and the provider of that property did not intend to benefit the recipient. The presumption of <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> is an inference of that lack of intention. The presumption of advancement is an inference that a gift was intended. The distinction between 'presumed' and 'automatic' <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> is rejected. Part Two explores the relationship between <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> and restitution. It is argued in chapter V (Restitution) that all <b>resulting</b> <b>trusts</b> reverse unjust enrichment. The restitutionary role of the <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> is considered by looking at (i) the types of unjust enrichment to which it responds, in chapters VI (Vitiated Intention), VII (Qualified Intention) and VIII (Mere Equities), and (ii) how it responds, in chapters IX (First- Measure Liability) and X (Fiduciary Obligations). Any defect in or qualification of the provider's intention to benefit the recipient, which gives the provider a right to restitution, should give rise to a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust,</b> so long as the property remains identifiable and the recipient has not obtained the unfettered beneficial ownership of that property before the right to restitution arises. This thesis concludes by looking at three areas affected by this view of resulting trusts: (i) the classification of trusts, (ii) proprietary restitution and (iii) defences to restitutionary claims. When trusts are organised by the events which give rise to them, the primary trust responding to unjust enrichment (by subtraction) is resulting...|$|R

These principles originated with Eyre CB's judgment in Dyer v Dyer, where he said that: [...] The clearest result of all the cases, without a single exception, is that the trust of a legal estate, whether freehold, copyhold or leasehold; whether taken in the names of the purchasers and others jointly, or in the names of other without that of the purchaser; whether in one name or several; whether jointly or successive - results to the man who advances the purchase money.

5000|$|A <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> (from the Latin 'resalire' meaning 'to jump back') is the {{creation}} of an implied trust by operation of law, where property is transferred to someone who pays nothing for it; and then is implied to have held the property for benefit of another person.

50|$|Accordingly, Westdeutsche {{argued that}} when it paid over the money a <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> arose immediately, because the bank plainly {{did not intend to}} make a gift.

The council contended that on traditional trust law principles there could be no <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> (and therefore no property right, and compound interest) because the council's conscience could not be affected when it could not know (before the judgment in Hazell) that the contract was void. A <b>resulting</b> <b>trust</b> needed to be linked to a deemed intention of the parties that money be held on trust, but there was none because the bank had intended the money to pass under a valid swap agreement (even though it did not turn out that way). It followed that compound interest could only begin accruing from the later date of the council's conscience being affected.|$|R
