The size principle was proposed by Elwood Henneman and his group in the 1960s as an explanation of the characteristic pattern with which individual motor neurons in a motor <b>pool</b> <b>fire.</b> The size principle stipulates that when the motor neurons of a motor <b>pool</b> <b>fire,</b> leading to the contraction of a terminal muscle fiber, the motor units containing the smallest motor neurons fire first. As excitatory signaling increases, larger motor neurons are subsequently recruited and contraction strength increases. Further, this differential recruitment of motor neurons occurs in instances of both increasing and decreasing contraction strength. As contraction strength is increased, the smallest motor units fire first and are also the last to stop firing as the contraction strength decreases.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{describes}} an experimental and theoretical inves-tigation of extinction limit of diesel <b>pool</b> <b>fires</b> suppressed by water mist. A downward-directed nozzle produced a fine water spray over small-scale opposed diesel <b>pool</b> <b>fires.</b> The fire extinction limit is obtained from minimum nozzle injection pressure or maximum fire size {{when the fire}} extinguishment took place. For the conditions tested, {{it is observed that}} there are two distinct regions in the relationship between the injection pressure and fire size, i. e., a fire suppression region and a fire intensification region. The transition of the two regions is dependent on the effective water flux and the plume-spray thrust ratio. It is also revealed that the fuel surface cooling is the dominant mechanism for diesel <b>pool</b> <b>fires</b> at extinction limit in the tests. The failure to cause fire extinction is mainly due to the insufficient water flux applied to remove enough heat from the fuel surface...|$|R

Stable ignition and combustion of both fuels was achieved with a spark {{at the end of}} the last the fuel spray for all injection strategy cases except for the single injection of large fuel quantities. The average rate of heat release and work output increased and the work variability decreased for both fuels with multiple injections of fuel for both engine loads.

Single injections of E 85 led to <b>pool</b> <b>fires</b> on the piston surface which were the only source of soot formation. <b>Pool</b> <b>fires</b> persisted after the end of conditions favourable to soot oxidation. For E 10 the source of soot formation was a combination of <b>pool</b> <b>fires</b> and gas phase soot formation at 3. 6 bar while at 5 bar <b>pool</b> <b>fires</b> were the only source.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} study of suppression of <b>pool</b> <b>fires</b> in enclosed spaces using water mist. The main objective of the present study is to understand the mechanisms responsible for the suppression of <b>pool</b> <b>fires</b> using water mists. Experiments were conducted in a large compartment with n-heptane <b>pool</b> <b>fires</b> of different heat release rates. The temperature variations in the compartment were measured using K-type thermocouples fixed at two locations. A multi gas analyzer was used to measure gas concentrations. The test results indicate that the water mist suppresses the diffusion flame in an enclosed space mainly through evaporating cooling and oxygen displacement by water vapors, resulting in inefficient combustion. The fire suppression time decreases with a decrease in droplet diameter. It is much easier to suppress a larger fire due to faster rates of evaporation of water droplets and therefore, the total mist requirement decreases with an increase in the fire size. The results of this study can find application in the design of water mist based fire fighting systems for indoor fires...|$|R

The authors propose that baroclinic vorticity generation is primarily responsible for production of rotational motion at small scale and that amalgamation is responsible for the production of large-scale rotational structures from the myriad of small-scale structures. Numerical simulations show that vortical structures having time-mean definitions can be resolved with a Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach.
