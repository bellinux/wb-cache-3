5000|$|The [...] "12 o'clock" [...] is a {{very high}} wheelie, past the normal balance point of the motorcycle. A {{variation}} {{of this is the}} [...] "coaster", in which the bike is balanced without the acting force of the motor, that is, with the <b>clutch</b> <b>pulled</b> in. The motorcycle is pulled so far back beyond the balance point of the wheel that the rider must constantly ride the rear brake to keep his machine from falling over backwards, causing him to slow down. A rider can <b>pull</b> in the <b>clutch</b> to create the effect of a wheelie with no engine noise. Conversely, some riders will <b>pull</b> in the <b>clutch</b> and peg the engine on its rev-limiter, called a [...] "rev-limiter coaster".|$|R

50|$|Some 1950s-era James {{motorcycles}} {{were built}} using Villiers engines that utilized a preselector gearbox. Press the gear pedal down to select 1st gear, then <b>pull</b> in the <b>clutch</b> lever {{and on its}} return the gear engaged and drove forward, press the gear pedal again to select 2nd gear and it will engage only after the lever has been pulled in again.|$|R
50|$|Previously, {{motorcycles}} with a non-primary {{starting system}} used the {{transmission input shaft}} and clutch hub to connect the kick-start lever to crankshaft. It was thus necessary for the rider to first put the transmission into neutral, and then {{to engage the clutch}} before the starting the engine by pushing down on the kick-start lever. With its primary starting system, the YA-1 engine is equipped with a mechanism in which the primary driven gear is turned by means of a kick idling gear and kick pinion. This enables the rider to simply <b>pull</b> the <b>clutch</b> lever on the handlebar (i.e., disengage the clutch) and then to kick-start engine, regardless of whether the transmission is in neutral or in (any) gear. This mechanism is now the established kick start system for motorcycles worldwide.|$|R
5000|$|To {{achieve a}} good start the rider needed to hold the {{throttle}} wide open and begin feathering the clutch {{as fast as possible}} while keeping the rpm between 10,000 and 11,000 rpm. If the tachometer dropped below 10,000 RPMs the rider needed to <b>pull</b> the <b>clutch</b> in, rev the motor and begin the process again. If the clutch was engaged too quickly the engine could [...] "bog" [...] or even stall {{while the rest of the}} starting field rode away. Even with the lightest of riders, the MT125R required slipping the clutch for 40 or more feet. The rewards for a successful launch were full throttle with quick shifts (approximately every 1,000 rpm) up through the six gears. At the end of sixth gear the hard-working 123 cc engine would be pulling along a straight stretch between 110 and 120 mph.|$|R
40|$|A rotary {{stepping}} device {{includes a}} rotatable shaft which {{is driven by}} means of a coiled spring clutch which is alternately tightened to grip and rotate the shaft and released to return it to a resting position. An actuator formed of a memory metal is used to <b>pull</b> the spring <b>clutch</b> to tighten it and rotate the shaft. The actuator is activated by heating it above its critical temperature and is returned to an elongated configuration by means of the force of the spring cloth...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the company}} was founded in 1938, wooden toys have been a {{trademark}} of HABA. The company became known in particular for its construction blocks, which up until now have been {{an integral part of}} the product range. Over the decades the product range has expanded: first incorporating other wooden toys such as <b>pulling</b> figures, vehicles, <b>clutching</b> toys and a complex upgradeable ball track system, followed later by the first society games. Which is how in 1986 the most famous HABA game “The Orchard” was created. The connections with the closely related Wehrfritz company were also taken advantage of in the upcoming development and production of children’s furniture -all made in a child friendly way using only the finest woods.|$|R
50|$|Episode 4 -- The {{seemingly}} benign Uncle Harry welcomes Mel and Jay {{into his}} home. But Mel is wary; {{she has seen}} him before - at EmbroGen. She pleads with Jay to leave, but Jay ignores her and steps into Harry’s <b>clutches,</b> <b>pulling</b> her in after him. Once inside, Uncle Harry is soon laying on the tea and biscuits and telling Jay all about his father Marshall’s ‘evil’ plan. Although he is relieved when Uncle Harry assures him {{that he is not}} a clone but rather the original blueprint, Jay is horrified when he discovers that he is a ‘chimera’ - someone with twice the number of genes and two complete sets of DNA. Mel is still suspicious of Uncle Harry and can only look on in horror as Jay willingly hands over his precious memory stick full of the genetic code to cloning.|$|R
5000|$|Used in watches, the keyless {{work are}} the gears that wind the {{mainspring}} when the crown is turned, {{and when the}} crown is pulled out allow the hands to be set. The term originated because, before the modern form of keyless work was invented by the French watchmaker Adrien Philippe in 1843, watches were wound and set by inserting a separate key into holes {{in the back and}} turning it. [...] The core of the keyless mechanism is a gear on the watch's winding stem, the clutch (or castle wheel in Britain), with two sets of axial gear teeth on it, which slides in and out. When the stem is pushed in, a lever slides the clutch out, and the outer set of teeth engages a small wheel train which turns the mainspring arbor, winding the mainspring. When the stem is <b>pulled</b> out, the <b>clutch</b> slides in, and the inner teeth engage another wheel, which turns the hour wheel in the motion work, turning the watch's hands.|$|R

5000|$|Cobblestone {{was one of}} {{the more}} {{lopsided}} maps there was at the major. Na'Vi were huge favorites to win against Liquid and 88% of Valve's [...] "Pick'Em" [...] predictions chose Na'Vi to win. Liquid started off with a 5-0 lead before Na'Vi would get on the board. The 4 round deficit for Na'Vi soon turned into a 9-round deficit as Liquid went on a streak. The score soon became 10-2 but Liquid would pick up two more rounds. In the 15th round, Na'Vi were limited but turned the situation into a 2 vs 4 and then a 1 vs 3 against s1mple. s1mple isolated Edward, then Zeus, then seized to <b>pull</b> off the <b>clutch</b> with just 1 health point left.

Edward had 18 kills for Na'Vi. GuardiaN had only three kills in the first half on his best personal map; although he did get 7 more kills, it seemed too little and too late.|$|R
50|$|TSM chose Train as its map pick. NiP {{started with}} an early 3-0 lead. In the first gun round, dupreeh went {{aggressive}} {{into the upper}} part of the B bombsite and tacked on a lot of damage onto GeT_RiGhT and cajunb was able to finish him off.

50|$|Luminosity chose Mirage, the {{map that}} put the team on the {{international}} scene. However, it did not bode well at the start for the Brazilians. Na'Vi won the pistol round {{and then the next}} five rounds to take a 6-0 lead. In the seventh round, LG executed towards the A bombsite. Edward found coldzera shortly after and flamie followed up on TACO after the bomb was planted. fnx traded flamie but Zeus took down fer and LG needed to defend the bomb in a 2 vs 4. FalleN traded Zeus and the found GuardiaN attempting to run into the site. seized picked off FalleN and that left fnx in a 1 vs 2. fnx was known for his clutches on LG {{and he was able to}} <b>pull</b> off another <b>clutch</b> by taking down seized and Edward and LG took its first grand final round ever. In the next round, LG had a man advantage. Edward killed fnx but coldzera was able to trade quickly and pick up the bomb. seized found coldzera with about twenty seconds remaining, leaving him and FalleN in a 1 vs 1. Both players were low on health as FalleN had 11 hp and seized had 9. FalleN got the bomb down with just one second remaining and then peeked out at just the right time to find seized. LG took the ninth round and made it 6-3. In the tenth round, fer found Edward peeking midway through the round but GuardiaN just about picked off fer to make it a 4 vs 4. seized found fnx at the B bombsite and Zeus killed coldzera attempting to trick Na'Vi. flamie killed FalleN and was immediately killed by TACO, but TACO could not win the 1 vs 3 and Na'Vi picked up a seventh round. Na'Vi would go on to eleven rounds and had a chance to pick up twelve with LG on a limited buy. However, LG was able to overwhelm the CIS team and make it a 4-11 deficit. LG started off the second half strong by winning the pistol round and the expected anti-economy rounds to make it 11-7. Na'Vi nearly took the 19th round, but GuardiaN accidentally killing seized and coldzera shutting a couple of players down gave LG the round. LG made it 10-11 but Na'Vi was able to withstand the bomb retake from LG and win the round, making it 12-10 under flamie's two kills. LG was able to reset Na'Vi the next round and soon LG tied the game. LG finally took the lead at 13-12 extended it to 14-12. Na'Vi had inferior rifles in the 27th round, but GuardiaN's two kills and Zeus being able to clutch against TACO kept Na'Vi in the game. LG took a timeout, but Na'Vi was able to get to 15 rounds first. In the last round of regulation, flamie took down LG's captain early but fnx evens it out by killing flamie. Na'Vi was ready for an A bombsite execute with no LG members directly on the site and Na'Vi seemed likely to take the round. However, as the execution took place, fer peeked to find a running GuardiaN. Zeus attempted to trade but fer hid and ran through his own smoke and coldzera came in time to kill Zeus. The bomb was planted but seized and Edward were left in a 2 vs 4. seized sprayed down fnx but was immediately traded by fer. Edward found fer but was sniped by coldzera as he was attempting to get away. TACO defused the bomb and LG forced overtime. Na'Vi won the first round of overtime under Zeus's triple kill and LG won the second round under fer's double kill. In the third round, Zeus found fer early. With about fifteen seconds left, Na'Vi rushed to the A bombsite, but flamie was taken down by FalleN. GuardiaN was able to plant the bomb just in time. fnx took down seized but was immediately traded by Zeus. GuardiaN missed a shot on coldzera and was punished right after. coldzera then found Zeus, leaving Edward in a 1 vs 3. However, like fnx for LG, Edward was known for his clutches on Na'Vi. Edward took down coldzera. TACO was defusing the bomb and needed less than one second left, but Edward purposely missed FalleN to take down TACO. FalleN traded Edward, but Edward taking down FalleN meant that there was no time left for LG and Edward was able to clutch the round. The teams switched sides and in the fourth round LG was able to take the B bombsite in twenty seconds, forcing the three remaining Na'Vi members to fall back and save their weapons. They were only able to save two after LG ran after flamie. LG came with another fast execute, this time in about 25 seconds, and LG was able to get to map point first. In the last round of the first overtime, FalleN found seized trying to peek while jumping at the B bombsite. However, GuardiaN was prepared and traded FalleN to make it a 4 vs 4 again. With about 25 seconds left, LG ran into the A bombsite. coldzera found flamie quickly but was traded by a hidden Zeus. Zeus had a chance to take down more LG players but fnx was able to trade him out. Edward tried to deny TACO from planting the bomb, but he killed him after the bomb was planted. GuardiaN missed a crucial shot on fnx and was taken down by the said LG player and Edward was left in another clutch situation. He shot down fnx but was taken down to 11 HP and fer was able to peek out right after and LG took the first game 19-17. Zeus had a massive 31 kills for Na'Vi and Edward had 29, but coldzera's 37 and fer's 30 bested Na'Vi. Meanwhile, GuardiaN, who was named the second best player of 2015 behind olofmeister, struggled with 19 kills and 27 deaths.|$|R
