EducationIt is {{well known}} that {{learners}} do not perform well in <b>physical</b> <b>science.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate how learners interpret the role of photographs and other illustrative devices in <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> and whether learners are able to identify <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> concepts that they think are embedded in the photographs found in grade 12 <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> textbooks. The study focused on photographs found in <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> textbooks as it is clear that photographs are explicitly used in <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> textbooks as pedagogical resources.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the factors associated with high school learners’ poor performance in <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> in the Libode District in the Eastern Cape. The research also meant to answer the following research objectives on factors associated with high school learners’ poor performance in <b>physical</b> <b>science.</b> The first research objective was based on determining the school related factors that cause poor performance in <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> in the Libode District, while the second research objective was based on determining the home related factors that caused poor performance in <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> in the Libode district. The third research objective was based on ascertaining the skills and competencies of both <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> educators and <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> learners to improve performance while the fourth objective was based on suggesting strategies that could improve performance of both the <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> learners and educators. Research objectives three and four were addressed as recommendation. The study employed a qualitative as well as a quantitative approach. Six public high schools in the Libode District participated in this study. The identities of all the respondents were protected accordingly. Upon analysis of the results, several school related and home related factors respectively were identified as causing poor performance in <b>physical</b> <b>science.</b> No single factor was accountable for the poor performance in <b>physical</b> <b>science.</b> Recommendations for improvement in the areas identified were provided as well as areas for further research.

40|$|M. Ed. The {{goal of this}} {{research}} study was to provide psycho-educational guidelines that will facilitate a positive experience of <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> for grade 10 learners. The stakeholders in {{this research}} study were grade 10 <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> learners and grade 10 <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> educators. A positive experience of <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> is important for various reasons. One reason {{is that there is}} a declining interest in learners pursuing scientific careers (Lepkowska, 1996 : 33). The main reason for this is that learners do not feel they are able to master the subject. They often do not understand what they are being taught in class and how it is applicable to their lives. Learners therefore experience a “love/hate” relationship with the subject – when they do well in the subject they like it and when they achieve poorly, they hate it. This complex relationship is often misunderstood by <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> educators. Educators often do not realise how they can change learners’ experience of the subject. It was one of the main aims of this research study to provide educators with practical guidelines on how to facilitate a positive experience of <b>physical</b> <b>science.</b> Three main themes were identified during the research: 1. Grade 10 learners’ experience of <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> is related to the psychosocial characteristics of the learner and his/her interaction with the environment. 2. Grade 10 learners’ experience of <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> is related to the method of instruction or the teaching method thereof in the classroom. 3. Grade 10 learners’ experience of <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> is related to the educators’ attitude, words and actions towards learners during the teaching of <b>physical</b> <b>science.</b> These three themes can be further substantiated by the following categories: • The feedback loop between the learners’ ability to understand <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> and their self-image in the presence of other learners. • Learners experience a love-hate relationship with <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> influenced by their ability to understand the subject. • Implementing practical activities such as experiments, practical assignments and attending science outings makes the subject more interesting, fun and able to understand. • Group activities in learning about <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> adds to the experience of it being fun and enable learners to learn more about others. • <b>Physical</b> <b>science</b> taught by relating its meaning in the learners "real life" is more interesting and easier to understand. • A context created where learners feel "comfortable with the teacher" promotes the approachability of the educator. • Disrespectful practices demonstrated by educators, lead to a negative experience of <b>physical</b> <b>science.</b> • Educators verbalising work pressure and showing stress related to the teaching of <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> increase the pressure and stress learners experience about the subject. Recommendations that could assist learners’ achievement in <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> should focus on facilitating a positive experience of the subject. It should takethe themes and categories of this study into consideration. Some important recommendations are: • Further research is required to find appropriate ways to enable educators and curriculum designers to successfully build systematic understanding of science through everyday knowledge and interests of learners. • The current <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> curriculum is national or universal but it should be locally defined. The curriculum should respond to local interests and needs. Science education will then be of immediate use to the learners and promote concept development that is more effective. It will also result in greater achievement of “critical outcomes” like problem solving, critical thinking, application of knowledge and teamwork. • Further research is needed to explain the negative correlation between learners’ attitude and perceptions towards <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> and their achievement in the subject. • The context of the <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> classroom has to be investigated to identify what the nature and style of teaching and activities are that engage learners in <b>physical</b> <b>science.</b> • More research is needed to examine instructional strategies in the classroom for improving all learners’ experience of <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> and achievement in science. The researcher experienced the research as very fulfilling and challenging. She realised that there are numerous possibilities within the <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> classroom where educators can influence their learners’ achievement...|$|R

60|$|Thus, to come, at last, to {{the really}} {{important}} part of all this discussion, if the belief in a God is essential to morality, <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> offers no obstacle thereto; if the belief in immortality is essential to morality, <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> has no more to say against the probability of that doctrine than the most ordinary experience has, and it effectually closes the mouths of those who pretend to refute it by objections deduced from merely physical data. Finally, if {{the belief in the}} uncausedness of volition is essential to morality, the student of <b>physical</b> <b>science</b> has no more to say against that absurdity than the logical philosopher or theologian. <b>Physical</b> <b>science,</b> I repeat, did not invent determinism, and the deterministic doctrine would stand on just as firm a foundation as it does if there were no <b>physical</b> <b>science.</b> Let any one who doubts this read Jonathan Edwards, whose demonstrations are derived wholly from philosophy and theology.|$|R
