5|$|Ebert was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for Maxivision 48, in which the movie <b>projector</b> runs at 48 frames per second, {{as compared to the}} usual 24 frames per second. He was opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their <b>projector</b> bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see. Ebert was skeptical of the recent resurgence of 3D effects in film, which he found unrealistic and distracting.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} announcement, the exhibits, seating and wiring were {{dismantled}} or removed. Some {{of the signs}} and paintings were recovered by the RASC, which had a permanent workspace located within the facility, and are now {{on display at the}} E.C. Carr Astronomical Observatory in Blue Mountain, Ontario and at David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill, Ontario. The original Zeiss-Jena <b>projector</b> was bought as a museum piece by York University for the sum of $1, subsequently dismantled, and placed into storage. More recently, the University has offered the mothballed <b>projector</b> to other planetaria seeking parts to repair their existing electro-mechanical planetarium projectors.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Projector,</b> 2.5inchmore {{commonly}} known as the Northover Projectorwas an ad hoc anti-tank weapon used by the British Army and Home Guard during the Second World War. With a German invasion of Great Britain seeming likely after the defeat in the Battle of France, most available weaponry was diverted to the regular British Army, leaving the Home Guard short on supplies, particularly anti-tank weaponry. The Northover <b>Projector</b> was designed by a Home Guard officer named Robert Harry Northover to act as a makeshift anti-tank weapon, and was put into production in 1940 following a demonstration to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|Given these shortcomings, any modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons. One such weapon was the Northover <b>Projector,</b> the invention of Major Robert Harry Northover. Northover, {{an officer in the}} Home Guard, designed it to be an easily manufactured and cheap anti-tank weapon, costing just under £10 to produce, excluding the required tripod. The Major wrote directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, with his design and arranged for Churchill to attend a demonstration of the Northover <b>Projector.</b> The Prime Minister approved of the weapon and gave it his personal endorsement, ordering in October 1940 that the weapon be mass-produced {{on a scale of one}} for every Home Guard platoon.|$|E

When the film <b>projector</b> stops working, Lisa mentions that Thomas Edison invented the <b>projector</b> and many other inventions. Homer decides {{to learn more about}} Edison and eventually idolizes him. In an attempt to follow his footsteps, he quits his job at the power plant to become an inventor.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{were made}} to the {{original}} planetarium <b>projector</b> over the years, allowing for special effects that could show close-up displays of specific planets, and the Sun and Moon projectors could replicate the experience of a solar or lunar eclipse.|$|E
50|$|Large scale image <b>projectors</b> {{have been}} pioneered by {{manufacturers}} Pani, Hardware Xenon and PIGI. These <b>projectors</b> are usually described as scenic <b>projectors,</b> and project light through photographic or inkjet media, unlike video <b>projectors</b> that reflect light off of LCD or DMD (digital micro mirror, {{sometimes referred to}} as DLP) devices. Despite advancements in video technology, still image <b>projectors</b> are still capable of many times the luminous output of video projection devices. Scenic <b>projectors</b> sometimes utilize roll based projection media, which allows quick access to hundreds of images and the creation of scrolling imagery, as well as rotating imagery.|$|R
50|$|<b>Projectors</b> used in {{projection}} clocks {{are similar}} to other <b>projectors,</b> and use the same optical principles. They usually use lenses although some <b>projectors</b> use the principle of shadow theater, vector or raster scanning.|$|R
50|$|Unlike LCD or DLP <b>projectors,</b> CRT <b>projectors</b> are {{somewhat}} prone to burn-in. This {{can lead to}} issues in brightness uniformity on <b>projectors</b> that frequently use both a full 4:3 and widescreen aspect ratio.|$|R
5|$|Later in 1941, more {{sophisticated}} weapons were made {{available such as}} the Blacker Bombard anti-tank weapon, the Northover <b>Projector</b> (a black-powder mortar), and the Smith Gun (a small artillery gun that could be towed by a private motorcar).|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film <b>projector.</b> In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the <b>projector</b> lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E

50|$|Different markets {{exist for}} screens {{targeted}} {{for use with}} digital <b>projectors,</b> movie <b>projectors,</b> overhead <b>projectors</b> and slide <b>projectors,</b> although the basic idea {{for each of them}} is very much the same: front projection screens work on diffusely reflecting the light projected on to them, whereas back projection screens work by diffusely transmitting the light through them.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Projector,</b> Infantry, Anti Tank (PIAT) Mk I was a British man-portable {{anti-tank}} weapon {{developed during the}} Second World War.

5|$|The Theatre outpaced 362 other Pepsi Refresh entrants, and was {{in first}} place {{by the middle of}} April. The RTC {{attributed}} its success in the contest to its use of social networking services, notably Facebook. The group considered moving to a digital <b>projector</b> with the forthcoming grant to replace the existing <b>projector,</b> an expected cost of $100,000. By late May, the group had won the April competition and was waiting for the Pepsi funds, before tendering a down payment on the Theatre, initially planned for June10. The closing date of the sale was pushed back to allow time to finalize the deal. In mid-June, the Playback Theatre planned a benefit for the RTC in which improv actors would perform skits based on audience members' stories of experiences they had at the Theatre.|$|E
5|$|The planetarium <b>projector</b> was a -long dumbbell-shaped object, with -diameter spheres {{attached}} at {{each end}} representing the night sky for {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres.

Scarcely a generation has passed since educators have gone from 16 -mm <b>projectors,</b> slide <b>projectors,</b> overhead <b>projectors,</b> and opaque <b>projectors</b> to video players, DVD players, computers, and power-point presentations in the classroom.

50|$|The first large-format slide <b>projectors</b> {{were built}} {{in the middle of the}} 20th century as {{background}} <b>projectors</b> for theaters and opera houses.

In good cooperation with the technician Ing. Ludwig Pani, they realized the first large format projections as an integrated part of their artwork.|$|R
5000|$|... 3LCD <b>projectors</b> {{can have}} higher color light output than single-chip DLP <b>projectors.</b> This is because 3LCD <b>projectors</b> mix and project the light beams {{from all three}} colors to form each {{individual}} pixel's color, while single-chip DLP <b>projectors</b> create colors by projecting them in sequence {{one at a time}} and rely on human color perception to mix and interpret the correct colors for each pixel.|$|R
