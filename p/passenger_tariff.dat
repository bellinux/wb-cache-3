50|$|Passenger {{service was}} {{abandoned}} in 1932 and the railway operated solely as a freight line, {{with the exception}} of offering passenger carriage in the line's cabooses. This situation lasted until the 1960s, with the parent company reportedly having forgotten to formally abandon the <b>passenger</b> <b>tariff.</b> The electrification was dismantled after this point except in Modesto, where a city ordinance prohibited the operation of steam locomotives. The railway therefore retained 2.1 miles of electrification within Modesto, and the railway's two steeplecab electric locomotives. Outside Modesto, all freight traffic was now steam hauled. Additional steam locomotives were borrowed from the Western Pacific when needed. In 1940, a former Sierra Railroad steam engine was acquired.|$|E

40|$|The Volga {{transport}} for 10 years (1923 - 1934) {{was influenced}} by all those changes which happened in the national economy of the country during the periods of the New Economic Policy and its transition to the forced industrialization. Since 1923 attempts of its delivery to concession {{in connection with the}} project of creation of the Volga-Don-Azov Sea hydraulic engineering constructions by means of the Western firms and banks took place. In 1929 those attempts ended without any results. Most likely, threat of outflow from the USSR of scarce currency in the form of profits of concessionaires was the main cause. That threat moved promises of foreign firms to significantly modernize and expand the Volga transport with all its coastal infrastructure, and also to promote creation of “new freights” in a zone of operations of the Volga fleet. Up to its reorganization in 1934 the Volga fleet constantly experienced the financial and technical difficulties caused by wear of watercrafts, low tariffs for a cargo transportation, etc. However, these low tariffs allowed the large new enterprises and constructions of the first five-year plans period to reduce their transport expenses. It favorably affected the process of industrialization of the Volga region and other ones. Losses on freight transportation were offset by the Volga water transport due to passenger traffic by increasing the high efficiency of passenger capacity of ships, an intensification of a passenger traffic and increase of a <b>passenger</b> <b>tariff...</b>|$|E
50|$|The Air Traffic Conference of America, a body {{within the}} Air Transport Association of America (ATA), {{was founded in}} 1945 to publish <b>passenger</b> <b>tariffs</b> (fares). In 1958 it assumed {{publication}} of freight tariffs, formerly produced by Air Cargo, Inc., and in 1965 the group divested from ATA as an independent company, Airline Tariff Publishers, Inc. It was reorganized and took its current name in 1975. ATPCO celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2015.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Passenger</b> <b>tariffs</b> (except for {{travelling}} in the stateroom, {{sleeping and}} VIP-cars) are {{approved by the}} State, represented by the Federal Tariff Service with social orientation of its traffic operations below cost. Passenger fare {{is divided into two}} components: «ticket» (which includes the cost of transport infrastructure, locomotive traction and the Station component) and «reserved seat» (service of transport company, which is the owner of the car). Since 2003, the flexible schedule tariffs (FST) to travel on long-distance trains is used: ...|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of capitalization, the state succeeded in {{transforming}} subsidies {{in the order of}} $10 million annually to the former ENFE into income through taxes and fees of about $2.5 million. The private companies met their investment commitments. In addition, the average train speed increased; less derailment occurred and the cost of freight transportation was reduced. However, <b>passenger</b> <b>tariffs</b> were raised, in part because they were previously subsidized. At the same time, the coverage of the rail system was reduced by closing several unproductive branches, which Were returned by the private companies to the State. In fact, 3692 km were transferred to private enterprises in 1997 and in 2011 they operated 1954 km, that is 47.1% less.|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} fare between Palmerston and Pine Creek was initially charged {{at a rate}} of 4d per mile for first class and 3d per mile for second class, relatively expensive given the passenger accommodations on the trains were criticised as being more suited to livestock than paying <b>passengers.</b> Similarly, <b>tariffs</b> for transport of heavy goods and machinery by rail to Pine Creek were seen by many as being set too high to promote growth of the mining industry even before the line opened, despite this being a major reason for its construction.|$|R

50|$|Airline {{reservation}} systems incorporate airline schedules, fare <b>tariffs,</b> <b>passenger</b> {{reservations and}} ticket records. An airline's direct distribution works {{within their own}} reservation system, as well as pushing out information to the GDS. The second type of direct distribution channel are consumers who use the internet or mobile applications {{to make their own}} reservations. Travel agencies and other indirect distribution channels access the same GDS as those accessed by the airline reservation systems, and all messaging is transmitted by a standardized messaging system that functions on two types of messaging that transmit on SITA's high level network (HLN). These messaging types are called Type A EDIFACT format for real time interactive communication and Type B TTY for informational and booking type of messages. Message construction standards set by IATA and ICAO, are global, and apply to more than air transportation. Since airline reservation systems are business critical applications, and they are functionally quite complex, the operation of an in-house airline reservation system is relatively expensive.|$|R
