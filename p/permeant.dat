40|$|Transdermal drug {{delivery}} offers many advantages over traditional drug administration {{methods such as}} injections and oral delivery, including increased patient compliance, and avoiding first-pass effects. However, due to the low skin permeability, transdermal {{drug delivery}} is currently limited to {{only a handful of}} drugs that are hydrophobic and of low molecular weight. The pharmaceutical relevance of many molecules that are excluded from this category, such as proteins, peptides, and DNA, has stimulated the investigation of various skin permeation enhancement methods, among which ultrasound represents a promising skin permeation enhancer. Previous work by our group has shown that ultrasound at a frequency of 20 kHz significantly enhances transdermal transport of drugs, a phenomenon referred to as Low-Frequency Sonophoresis (LFS). The objective of this thesis was to develop a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of low-frequency sonophoresis (LFS) with an emphasis on the transdermal transport of hydrophilic <b>permeants.</b> An important goal was to utilize this mechanistic understanding to develop guidelines for the rational design of clinical LFS systems. With this in mind, a transport theory was developed to characterize the skin porous pathway of hydrophilic <b>permeants,</b> and to account for the effects of convection during LFS. Through a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of transdermal transport of hydrophilic <b>permeants</b> in both the presence {{and in the absence of}} ultrasound, I demonstrated that skin transport of hydrophilic <b>permeants</b> can be described adequately with a skin porous-pathway model. (cont.) The theory developed can be used not only to predict the rate of drug penetration across the skin, but also to characterize the effect of various ultrasound conditions on the skin microscopic transport properties (the effective pore radius and the ratio of porosity to tortuosity of the skin porous pathway), thus enabling the optimization of the ultrasound conditions for the rational design of LFS drug delivery systems. In addition, the theory can potentially be utilized to characterize the effects of other skin permeation enhancers, such as chemical enhancers (for example, water) and iontophoresis, on the skin porous pathway. Based on two-photon microscopy imaging of the 3 D-distribution of hydrophilic probes in the skin, the relevance of the intercellular and the intracellular domains for the transport of hydrophilic <b>permeants</b> was inferred. Results suggest that LFS causes the formation of localized transport regions on the skin, and that within each localized transport region, the distribution of the skin pathway of hydrophilic <b>permeants</b> is a function of the skin depth. Specifically, in the superficial region of the skin, the pathway is both intercellular and intracellular, while in the deeper regions of the skin, the pathway is primarily intercellular. This inhomogeneous 3 D-distribution of the hydrophilic probe in the skin during LFS suggests heterogeneity in the nature of the skin permeabilization mechanisms by LFS, which could possibly be attributed to the cavitation mechanism [...] . by Hua Tang.

Dynamical mechanical analysis indicated that the glass transition temperature of the PU’s were respectively 118, 95, and − 40 °C. Whereas the ethylene glycol and 1, 10 -decanediol materials exhibited a glass–rubber transition, the silicone containing PU showed rubber characteristics over the temperature 0 – 180 °C. The PALS measurements on the silicone-based PU’s showed significantly larger voids dimensions than the other PU’s. Void collapse is observed to occur on the time scale of the oPs measurements. The permeation of dioctyl phthalate, 2 -ethylhexylbenzyl phthalate, nonylphenol ethoxylate, isopropyl myristate, and oleic acid into a polyurethane matrix was measured gravimetrically. The silicone containing material at low temperatures exhibits relative simple permeation behavior however deviations from simple Fickian-type behavior are observed at higher temperature. Surprisingly, the ethylene glycol and 1, 10 -decanediol exhibited no significant absorption {{over a period of}} 5 months with the exception being nonylphenol ethoxylate. A comparison of the void sizes with the molecular dimensions for the lowest energy conformations of the <b>permeants</b> obtained using theoretical calculations indicate that for the silicone-based material the diffusion cross section for the <b>permeants</b> is larger than the available void size.

50|$|The {{process of}} {{permeation}} involves {{the diffusion of}} molecules, called the <b>permeant,</b> through a membrane or interface. Permeation works through diffusion; the <b>permeant</b> will move from high concentration to low concentration across the interface. A material can be semipermeable, {{with the presence of}} a semipermeable membrane. Only molecules or ions with certain properties will be able to diffuse across such a membrane. This is a very important mechanism in biology where fluids inside a blood vessel need to be regulated and controlled. Permeation can occur through most materials including metals, ceramics and polymers. However, the permeability of metals is much lower than that of ceramics and polymers due to their crystal structure and porosity. Permeation is something that must be regarded highly in various polymer applications, due to their high permeability. Permeability depends on the temperature of the interaction as well as the characteristics of both the polymer and the <b>permeant</b> component. Through the process of sorption, molecules of the <b>permeant</b> can be either absorbed or desorbed at the interface. The permeation of a material can be measured through numerous methods that quantify the permeability of a substance through a specific material.|$|E

From permeation studies found in the scientific literature lag times, diffusion coefficients or permeation rates towards organic chemicals could not derived because of the slow diffusion process of the <b>permeants</b> in PET. Knowledge about lag times or diffusion coefficients for different <b>permeants,</b> however, is essential for the evaluation of the barrier properties of PET films towards organic contaminants, e. g. mineral oil hydrocarbons.

40|$|Gap {{junctions}} {{represent a}} ubiquitous and {{integral part of}} multicellular organisms, providing the only conduit for direct exchange of nutrients, messengers and ions between neighboring cells. However, {{at the molecular level}} we have limited knowledge of their endogenous <b>permeants</b> and selectivity features. By probing the accessibility of systematically substituted cysteine residues to thiol blockers (a technique called SCAM), we have identified the pore-lining residues of a gap junction channel composed of Cx 32. Analysis of 45 sites in perfused Xenopus oocyte pairs defined M 3 as the major pore-lining helix, with M 2 (open state) or M 1 (closed state) also contributing to the wider cytoplasmic opening of the channel. Additional mapping of a close association between M 3 and M 4 allowed the helices of the low resolution map (Unger et al., 1999. Science. 283 : 1176 – 1180) to be tentatively assigned to the connexin transmembrane domains. Contrary to previous conceptions of the gap junction channel, the residues lining the pore are largely hydrophobic. This indicates that the selective permeabilities of this unique channel class may result from novel mechanisms, including complex van der Waals interactions of <b>permeants</b> with the pore wall, rather than mechanisms involving fixed charges or chelation chemistry as reported for other ion channels...|$|R
40|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} are inherently impermeable to hydrophobic compounds, {{due to the}} synergistic activity of the permeability barrier imposed by the outer membrane and energy dependent efflux systems. The gram-negative, enteric pathogen Vibrio cholerae appears to be deficient in both these activities; the outer membrane is not an effective barrier to hydrophobic <b>permeants,</b> presumably due {{to the presence of}} exposed phospholipids on the outer leaflet of the outer membrane, and efflux systems are at best only partially active. When V. cholerae was grown in the presence of bile, entry of hydrophobic compounds into the cells was significantly reduced. No difference was detected in the extent of exposed phospholipids on the outer leaflet of the outer membrane between cells grown in {{the presence or absence of}} bile. However, in the presence of energy uncouplers, uptake of hydrophobic probes was comparable between cells grown in the presence or absence of bile, indicating that energy-dependent efflux processes may be involved in restricting the entry of hydrophobic <b>permeants</b> into bile grown cells. Indeed, an efflux system(s) is essential for survival of V. cholerae in the presence of bile.

It was concluded that generic penetration modulation was not a realistic goal. Investigations into skin surface sampling techniques highlighted the difficulties of minimising variability, and comparison of in vitro tape stripping with published in vivo data for a clobetasol propionate cream demonstrated the significance of formulation inhomogeneity. Determination of orally administered doxycycline in the stratum corneum using in vivo skin surface biopsies suggested that {{it was unlikely that}} this technique could be of value for most orally administered drugs. Evaporative loss of volatile <b>permeants,</b> such as fragrances, during skin penetration studies makes it impossible to achieve full mass balance. Direct capture of evaporating material was occlusive and significantly affected the amount that permeated through the skin membranes. A simple novel method was therefore developed to allow estimation of evaporative loss under the experimental conditions. Pre-study skin water permeability coefficient (Kp) is frequently used as a membrane integrity check and it is generally assumed that skin of higher water permeability will be of higher permeability for subsequently applied compounds, regardless of differing physiochemical properties.

40|$|AbstractThe open state(s) of gap {{junction}} channels {{is evident from}} their permeation by small ions {{in response to an}} applied intercellular (transjunctional/transchannel) voltage gradient. That an open channel allows variable amounts of current to transit from cell-to-cell {{in the face of a}} constant intercellular voltage difference indicates channel open/closing can be complete or partial. The physiological significance of such open state options is, arguably, the main concern of junctional regulation. Because {{gap junction}}s are permeable to many substances, it is sensible to inquire whether and how each open state influences the intercellular diffusion of molecules as valuable as, but less readily detected than current-carrying ions. Presumably, structural changes perceived as shifts in channel conductivity would significantly alter the transjunctional diffusion of molecules whose limiting diameter approximates the pore's limiting diameter. Moreover, changes in junctional permeability to some molecules might occur without evident changes in conductivity, either at macroscopic or single channel level. Open gap junction channels allow the exchange of cytoplasmic <b>permeants</b> between contacting cells by simple diffusion. The identity of such <b>permeants,</b> and the functional circumstances and consequences of their junctional exchange presently constitute the most urgent (and demanding) themes of the field. Here, we consider the necessity for regulating this exchange, the possible mechanism(s) and structural elements likely involved in such regulation, and how regulatory phenomena could be perceived as changes in chemical vs. electrical coupling; an overall reflection on our collective knowledge of junctional communication is then applied to suggest new avenues of research.
