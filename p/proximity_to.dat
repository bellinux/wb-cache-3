5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, war between Britain and Germany {{began to seem}} likely. Ramsgate's {{location}} on both the English Channel and North Sea and its <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> the Thames Estuary, its large port facilities, and its close <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> RAF Manston made it a likely target for heavy aerial bombing and as a landing site for any German invasion of Britain. With this in mind the town's borough engineer and surveyor, R. D.

40|$|Three {{types of}} <b>proximity</b> are argued <b>to</b> {{be present in}} the {{research}} material in this paper. First, put simply, geographic <b>proximity</b> refers <b>to</b> two entities being physically next to each other. Second, cultural <b>proximity</b> refers <b>to</b> two entities being relationally close to one another, with geographic proximity often not being required. Third, network <b>proximity</b> refers <b>to</b> two entities being associated through or with a third entity, again with geographic proximity often not being required. Geographies of links between entities [...] people, enterprises, places, etc [...] trace networks of relations. Geographic proximity remains crucial, but the relational spaces of geographic networks that selectively connect entities in different ways around the world are just as important. In this paper some elements from actor-network theory are used to approach the investigation of multiple proximities. The argument is exemplified through a recent case study of the restructuring of transport logistics of newsprint manufactured in Australia. ...|$|R

5|$|Scarborough's {{climate is}} {{moderate}} for Canada {{due to its}} southerly location within the country and its <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> Lake Ontario. It has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb), with warm, humid summers and generally cold winters. Mean temperature and precipitation tends to be slightly lower than the downtown core or south Etobicoke for instance, {{due in part to}} the weather station being farther from the moderating influence of the lake and also because of its more northeast location. Conditions vary based on <b>proximity</b> <b>to</b> the lake, with fog more common in the south and areas close to the lake noticeably cooler on hot summer days.|$|E

30|$|Sixteen {{rainfall}} datasets {{were used}} for the multiple regression.
