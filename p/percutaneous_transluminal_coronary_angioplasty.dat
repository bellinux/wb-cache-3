40|$|Background: In {{the past}} decade, {{a number of}} cohort studies studies {{have been carried out}} to {{investigate}} the relationship between the insertion/deletion polymorphism of the gene encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme and risk of restenosis after <b>percutaneous</b> <b>transluminal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angioplasties</b> in patients.

We therefore performed a meta-analysis of the published studies to clarify this inconsistency and to establish a comprehensive picture of the relationship between ACE I/D polymorphism and post-PTCA restenosis risk. Methods: Databases including Pubmed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, EBSCO, Cochrane Library databases and CNKI were searched to find relevant studies.

We report the data of the year 2001 and give an overview of the development of coronary interventions since 1992, when the first data collection was performed. Methods and Results Questionnaires were distributed to delegates of the individual national societies of cardiology represented in the European Society of Cardiology. These were completed by the local institutions and operators and showed that 1, 806, 238 angiograms and 617, 176 <b>percutaneous</b> <b>transluminal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angioplasties</b> (PTCAs) were performed in 2001.

In this study, we assess whether the outcome of OPCAB surgery is affected in such patients. METHODS: We retrospectively compared perioperative parameters in 66 OPCAB patients (group A) with LMD and 216 OPCAB patients without (group B) LMD. The patients were operated in the time frame between 2002 and 2007. LMD {{was defined as a}} stenosis > 50 %. RESULTS: Patients in group A had a higher EuroSCORE (logistic: 3. 7 +/- 0. 1 vs 6. 3 +/- 0. 3, p= 0. 027), increased coronary artery disease (CAD) family history (p= 0. 015) and cerebrovascular accidents (p= 0. 027), increased history of congestive heart failure (p= 0. 013), more urgent surgery (p= 0. 008), previous <b>percutaneous</b> <b>transluminal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>angioplasties</b> (PTCAs) (p= 0. 05) and previous stent implantation (p= 0. 023). An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted more frequently in the LMD group preoperatively (p= 0. 004). There were two conversions to on-pump during OPCAB surgery. There were no differences in the postoperative outcomes in the LMD group A versus group B, such as cardiac-related events, neurological deficits, cardiac enzyme course, arrhythmias, blood loss, infections and renal failure.

In Chapter 2, an review is given of the pharmacological agents that have been tested in the animal model and postangioplasty patients. In Chapter 3 and 4, the methodological problems in the assessment of elastic recoil, stretch and balloon-artery ratio and the role of elastic recoil as a cause of luminal narrowing using quantitative methods are discussed. The 453 patients described in Chapter 3, represents the patients that were enrolled in the Thoraxcenter, in one of three following pharmacological restenosis prevention trials: 1) CARPORT (Coronary Artery Restenosis Prevention On Repeated Thromboxane-antagonism), 2) MERCATOR (Multicenter European Research trial with Cilazapril after <b>Angioplasty</b> to prevent <b>Transluminal</b> <b>coronary</b> Obstruction and Restenosis) or 3) PARK (Post Angioplasty Restenosis prevention with Ketanserin)). In Chapter 4 angiographic risk factors, including stretch and elastic recoil, for long term luminal narrowing (6 months) after a successful angioplasty procedure were investigated. To obtain independent predictors of a significant Joss in minimal luminal diameter (MLD) - loss ::: 0. 72 mm - a multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to 595 lesions with balloon measurements. Patients described in this chapter were enrolled in the CARPORT trial. In Chapter 5 and 6 the role of an "unwanted'' and "therapeutic" type of dissection during and after <b>percutaneous</b> <b>transluminal</b> <b>coronary</b> balloon <b>angioplasty</b> are discussed. In Chapter 5, the role of qualitative and quantitative lesion morphology, in addition to clinical patient characteristics, in prediction of patients at high risk for major cardiac procedural or in-hospital cardiac events, was investigated.

25|$|Laboratory {{evidence}} of increased inflammation combined with demographic features (male sex, age {{less than six}} months or greater than eight years) and incomplete response to IVIG therapy create a profile of a high-risk patient with Kawasaki disease. The likelihood that an aneurysm will resolve appears to be determined in large measure by its initial size, in which the smaller aneurysms have a greater likelihood of regression. Other factors are positively associated with the regression of aneurysms, including being younger than a year old at the onset of Kawasaki disease, fusiform rather than saccular aneurysm morphology, and an aneurysm location in a distal coronary segment. The highest rate of progression to stenosis occurs among those who develop large aneurysms. The worst prognosis occurs in children with giant aneurysms.

Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. ResultsThe 10 -year survival was 71. 0 % for PTCA and 73. 5 % for CABG (p = 0. 18). At 10 years, the PTCA group had substantially higher subsequent revascularization rates than the CABG group (76. 8 % vs. 20. 3 %, p < 0. 001), but angina rates for the 2 groups were similar. In the subgroup of patients with no treated diabetes, survival rates were nearly identical by randomization (PTCA 77. 0 % vs. CABG 77. 3 %, p = 0. 59). In the subgroup with treated diabetes, the CABG assigned group had higher survival than the PTCA assigned group (PTCA 45. 5 % vs. CABG 57. 8 %, p = 0. 025).

40|$|Atherosclerotic {{cardiovascular}} disease {{remains one of}} the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized world. Treatment is basically aimed at palliation and consists of either pharmacological intervention or revascularization. The frrst significant advances in the latter were largely surgical [!].

40|$|Ischemic {{heart disease}} (IHD) has now assumed a global dimension. It still {{remains one of}} the major health {{problems}} not only in the advanced countries, but also, is becoming a serious health issue in the developing and the economically weaker countries. Apart from other factors, changing economic scenario, stress and strain in daily life as well as altered dietary habits in the populations appear responsible for the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The treatment modalities, invasive, non-invasive and pharmacological are economically no dearer, even to population of affluent countries. Likewise, treatment costs of serious cardiovascular diseases are becoming difficult to be borne by population of the developing nations. Prevention of IHD would be a better way to protect the population from physical and economic disaster. The current article comprehensively describes the relation between oxidative stress and cardiac disease, explains the direct effect of reactive oxygen species on cardiac function and projects how the use of vitamin E can be of benefit in the prevention of IHD with concluding remarks highlighting the need for inclusion of a fruit and vegetable rich diet and regular exercise to keep the dearer heart active and healthy.

The study group was subdivided according to whether the collateral vessels were sufficient (n =  17) or insufficient (n =  37) to prevent ECG signs of myocardial ischaemia during PTCA. Washout collaterometry—an angiographic washout method—was carried out simultaneously; after injection of radiographic contrast medium into the collateral receiving vessel followed immediately by vascular occlusion, the number of heart beats was counted until approximately half the length of the epicardial vessel was cleared of contrast.  RESULTS—The collateral flow index was higher (0. 28  (0. 09) v 0. 12  (0. 07); p <  0. 0001) and the contrast washout time shorter (8. 0  (2. 9) v 17. 5  (6. 7) heart beats; p <  0. 0001) in patients with sufficient versus insufficient collaterals. There was an inverse correlation between contrast washout time and collateral flow index (r =  0. 72, p <  0. 0001). Washout of contrast distal to the occluded vessel within 11  heart beats correctly determined sufficient and insufficient collaterals with 88 % sensitivity and 81 % specificity.  CONCLUSIONS—Washout collaterometry is a new radiographic contrast washout method based on the inverse relation between collateral flow and the time to clearance of radiographic dye injected into the ipsilateral vessel during PTCA. It appears to be an accurate method of characterising coronary collateral vessels.    Keywords: coronary artery disease; collateral circulation; coronary angiograph...|$|R
