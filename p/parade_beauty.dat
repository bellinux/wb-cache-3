50|$|In retrospect {{the bowl}} faced {{numerous}} challenges {{that may have}} been insurmountable. It was created just a single year before other Division II bowl games were merged into the division's new playoff format, leaving the Pelican Bowl in an isolated position starting with the 1974 season. Also in 1974, since the bowl was based in Louisiana, it was quickly overshadowed by the new Bayou Classic with its heated rivalry game, battle of the bands, <b>parade,</b> <b>beauty</b> pageant, and other such events that soon made it the biggest spectacle in black college football; by the standards that the Bayou Classic had set for entertainment, the Pelican Bowl almost seemed anticlimactic, despite being for a bigger prize (the black national title). It did not help the Pelican Bowl's prospects that the SWAC largely ran the bowl by itself, with little support from the MEAC. Both conferences, though similar in that they represented Division II black schools, were very different in other regards, with different experiences, and moving at different paces. The SWAC consisted largely of Deep South schools, created in 1920 out of necessity while facing the brunt of the Jim Crow era; SWAC schools (other than the notable exception of Grambling) were still struggling to recruit with the Southeastern Conference now integrated. The MEAC, on the other hand, was formed by East Coast schools in the post-segregation world of 1970, during a time when many of its member schools were now regularly scheduling predominantly white teams; it had already had some time to adapt to new recruiting strategies, since the neighboring Atlantic Coast Conference had begun integrating four years before the SEC had. Years later, when the Heritage Bowl was created (in 1991), it too seemed to have been viewed differently by the two conferences, as the MEAC champions showed a much higher tendency to forgo their bowl bid in favor of NCAA playoff invitations. By 2015, however, both leagues appeared equally cooperative and supportive of the new Celebration Bowl.|$|E

50|$|A <b>beauty</b> <b>parade</b> is {{a synonym}} for a formal {{presentation}} given to a panel {{in response to a}} request for tender.

5000|$|During the Cold War, the United States {{government}} strengthened {{social control}} over public spaces {{to go against}} queer visibility and solidify the stability of heterosexual families.

A number of Chinese-American leaders organized the Chinese New Year Festival parade in Chinatown, including art shows, street dances, martial arts, music, and a fashion show. In 1954, the <b>parade</b> added <b>beauty</b> queens to this annual ritual. By 1958, the group of beauty queens had been formally expanded into the pageant of [...] "Miss Chinatown U.S.A", which became a huge attraction across the country. By emphasizing traditional Confucian gender norms, the New Year <b>parade</b> used the <b>beauty</b> pageant to produce an image of exotic and obedient ethnic womanhood, and to promote gender hierarchy within Chinatown society in order to reverse their image as threatening figures of [...] "sexual and gendered deviance". Consequently, the Asian American queer community had to keep silent in this social-political environment.|$|R

It contained, as its subtitle suggests ("The World's Loveliest Girls"), pictures of attractive models who had the [...] "girl-next-door" [...] look. <b>Beauty</b> <b>Parade</b> also began the photo-story format that would be repeated by other Harrison publications. Using the facilities of Quigley Publishing surreptitiously at night, Harrison used the photos from his Hollywood visit to paste together his galleries. When he was caught and fired on Christmas Eve, 1941, his sisters Edith and Helen rallied around him and raised several thousand dollars in capital, $400 of it from his favorite niece, Marjorie, who would later become a central figure in his most famous enterprise.|$|R

2500|$|Having {{learned from}} Quigley {{what he could}} get away with legally, Harrison struck out on his own with a series of non-pornographic [...] "cheesecake" [...] magazines. His first was <b>Beauty</b> <b>Parade</b> (1941–1956), started in October 1941.

Harrison had great success with <b>Beauty</b> <b>Parade</b> and five sister magazines, but their circulation declined in the post-war years. Harrison had a distaste for full nudity and refused to follow the trend of magazines such as Playboy. By early 1952 his accountant told him that he was broke.|$|R
50|$|Every January, Sincelejo {{opens the}} holiday for Fiestas del dulce nombre de Jesús (The {{party of the}} sweet name of Jesus) which takes place on January 20. The festival begins {{a few days earlier}} and {{includes}} a number of <b>parades,</b> a <b>beauty</b> contest, and several days of bullfighting within a temporary wooden circular structure similar to a stadium named Corraleja. This is why the holiday is also called Las Fiestas de Corraleja. On January 20, 1980, a combination of overcrowding and panic caused the bullring's wooden bleachers to collapse, killing 222 persons, although some estimates place the death toll at almost 400. This tragedy put traditional Corraleja on hiatus. In 1999 the municipality authorized the construction of the wooden structure renewing the bullfighting.|$|R

In 1941, Moran helped the magazine publisher, Robert Harrison, to launch a new men's magazine called <b>Beauty</b> <b>Parade,</b> and he later contributed pin-ups to other Harrison magazines such as Flirt, Wink and Giggles.|$|R
5000|$|Critics had {{described}} the original pageant as a <b>parade</b> of <b>beauty</b> with no brains. Former pageant manager Yomi Onanuga {{told an interviewer}} in 2006: [...] "We are tired of seeing girls on stage after two weeks in camp, and having much fun, all we see is that they ask them questions and they win. Two months after, somebody asks her the same question, she cannot answer, and people begin to ask, Where did she get her crown from?". English Literature student Ibinabo Fiberesima was unable to name the vice-chancellor of the University of Ibadan which she attended. Fiberesima has claimed in numerous interviews and on her former website that she had competed in 1997, but this statement is questionable because no contest was held from 1994 to 1998; she had actually been a contestant in 1991, finishing second behind Bibiana Ohio.|$|R

Several other community events are held throughout the year. In early May, the city's sizable Mexican community celebrates Cinco de Mayo in Wright Park with live music, folk dance performances, and traditional Mexican cuisine. To celebrate Independence Day, the city holds its Old-Fashioned Fourth of July which includes a fireworks display and children's activities at Boot Hill.

2500|$|The one Harrison men's {{magazine}} that {{differed from the}} <b>Beauty</b> <b>Parade</b> format was Whisper, started in April 1946. It began as a clone of <b>Beauty</b> <b>Parade,</b> but became more explicit, violent and blatantly sexual. In 1953 Harrison was arrested for staging a Whisper photo shoot at a New Jersey golf course. It starred Page as a prisoner being tortured by models dressed in skimpy Ku Klux Klan-like costumes. But the old format of suggested nudity and sex was not working in the 1950s {{as it did in}} the '40s. During the heyday of his cheesecake magazines, Harrison moved with his sister Helen from their two-bedroom apartment into a nine-bedroom suite at the Parc Vendôme. Harrison became a fixture on the New York nightclub scene and was portrayed as a playboy in society columns. He indulged in his trademark proclivity toward all things white—Cadillacs, tailored suits from Sulka, cashmere polo coats and hats. He was often photographed in the company of Broadway or Hollywood starlets. But the circulation of his magazines declined in the post-war years. By early 1952 his accountant told him that he was broke. In addition to rival imitators, Harrison [...] "could not compete with the new celebrity focused men’s magazine, Playboy, whose first issue, released in 1953, featured a full color centerfold of Marilyn Monroe." [...] But Harrison had an aversion to real nudity and never went the route of Playboy. Instead, he returned to his New York Graphic roots. Thus Whisper would morph a third time in the 1950s to imitate the most audacious of Harrison's periodicals.|$|R
