40|$|Surgical site {{infection}} (SSI) is {{a common}} complication of surgery and {{a major cause of}} morbidity, mortality and health care costs. Several patient and perioperative care related factors play a role in SSI, which above all {{is the result of a}} complex process. Timing of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) is a <b>process</b> <b>indicator</b> that has been described extensively. However, the optimal timing remains controversial. A large SSI reduction was initially shown for administration of AP within two hours before incision. Later the optimal timing seemed to be 30 - 60 minutes or the final 30 minutes before incision. Recently, it has been shown that there is no significant association between timing and SSI. This controversy is reflected in several guidelines with dissimilar advice.

We apply a landscape ecology theory, supported by exploratory and confirmatory statistical techniques, to empirically test landscape metrics for reporting Montreal <b>Process</b> <b>Indicator</b> 1. 1 e in continuous dry eucalypt forests of sub-tropical Queensland, Australia. Target biota examined included: the Yellow-bellied Glider (Petaurus australis); the diversity of nectar and sap feeding glider species including P. australis, the Sugar Glider P. breviceps, the Squirrel Glider P. norfolcensis, and the Feathertail Glider Acrobates pygmaeus; six diurnal forest birds species; total diurnal bird species diversity; and the density of nectar-feeding diurnal bird species. Two scales of influence were considered: the stand-scale (2 ha), and a series of radial landscape extents (500 m - 2 km; 78 - 1250 ha) surrounding each fauna transect. For all biota, stand-scale structural and compositional attributes were found to be more influential than landscape metrics. For the Yellow-bellied Glider, the proportion of trace habitats with a residual element of old spotted-gum/ironbark eucalypt trees was a significant landscape metric at the 2 km landscape extent. This is a measure of habitat loss rather than habitat fragmentation. For the diversity of nectar and sap feeding glider species, the proportion of trace habitats with a high coefficient of variation in patch size at the 750 m extent was a significant landscape metric. None of the landscape metrics tested was important for diurnal forest birds. We conclude that no single landscape metric adequately captures the response of the region 2 ̆ 7 s forest biota per se.

40|$|There are {{two basic}} types of coal mine gases: gas from demethanation of coal deposits, and {{ventilation}} gas; containing combustible ingredients (mainly methane, CH 4). Effective use of these gases is an important technical and ecological issue (greenhouse gas emissions), mainly due {{to the presence of}} methane in these gases. Serious difficulties in this area (e. g. using them as the fuel for internal combustion (IC) engine) occur mainly in relation to the ventilation gas, whereas the gas from demethanation of coal deposits can be used directly as the fuel for internal combustion engines. The proposed solution of this problem shows that the simple mixing of these two gases (without supplying of oxygen from ambient air) is the effective way to producing the gaseous combustible mixture, which can be used for the fueling of internal combustion gas engines. To evaluate the energy usefulness of this way produced combustible mixture the <b>process</b> <b>indicator</b> has been proposed, which expresses the share of the chemical energy supplied with the ventilation gas, in the whole chemical energy of the produced fuel combustible mixture.

Methods: Data were retrospectively audited from 300 acute stroke patient records regarding allied health care. Compliance with each of 20 indicators of allied health care quality was established. The influence of various demographic and stroke-related variables on each performance indicator was examined. We undertook a series of analyses using univariate logistic regression models to establish the influence of these variables on care quality. Results: Patient age had a significant correlation with only one <b>process</b> <b>indicator</b> (early mobilization). Seven variables, including stroke severity and level of dependence, were associated with patient age.

40|$|Objective: Indicator {{scores are}} {{increasingly}} {{used to compare}} quality of care for diabetes patients etween general practices. Patient characteristics, such as age, gender and presence of other chronic diseases, {{are known to be}} associated with the care process. We studied to which extent patient characteristics influence quality indicator scores for diabetes care at general practice level. Methods: We included 10, 832 patients with diabetes mellitus from 62 general practices participating in NIVEL’s Primary Care Database in 2011. A set of 14 quality indicators was used including both process and intermediate outcome scores; i. e. HbA 1 c, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, body mass index, kidney function and smoking status. Based on multilevel logistic regression models we assessed the variation of quality indicator scores between practices with and without taking patient characteristics (age, gender and comorbidity) into account. Per practice, it was determined whether or not corrections for patient characteristics (case-mix correction) resulted in a relevant change of indicator scores (> 2 % decrease or increase of the indicator score at practice level). Results: Corrections for patient characteristics did not significantly reduce the over-all variation of indicator scores between general practices. However, for individual practices, correction for case-mix resulted in relevant changes. In 18 % - 45 % (median 26 %) of the practices, case-mix correction resulted in a change of <b>process</b> <b>indicator</b> scores of more than 2 %. For example, the largest increase for the HbA 1 c <b>process</b> <b>indicator</b> score in a practice was 5. 7 % (increase from 72. 3 % to 78. 1 %). For the intermediate outcome indicators, 34 % - 66 % (median 52 %) of the practices had a relevant change in indicator scores. For example, for systolic blood pressure the largest increase of the intermediate outcome indicator score in a practice was 9. 9 % (increase from 32. 1 % to 42. 1 %). Conclusions: At general practice level, indicator scores for the quality of diabetes care are influenced by characteristics of the patient population. For a fair and valid comparison of scores between general practices, a correction for the composition of the patient population is necessary. (aut. ref. ...|$|E

To allow comparison across MNH programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a core set of essential <b>process</b> <b>indicators</b> is needed. Although such a core set is available for emergency obstetric care (EmOC), the 'EmOC signal functions', a similar approach is currently missing for MNH routine care evaluation. We describe a strategy for identifying core <b>process</b> <b>indicators</b> for routine care and illustrate their usefulness in a field example. We first developed an indicator selection strategy by combining epidemiological and programmatic aspects relevant to MNH in LMICs. We then identified routine care <b>process</b> <b>indicators</b> meeting our selection criteria by reviewing existing quality of care assessment protocols. We grouped these indicators into three categories based on their main function in addressing risk factors of maternal or neonatal complications. We then tested this indicator set in a study assessing MNH quality of clinical care in 33 health facilities in Malawi. Our strategy identified 51 routine care processes: 23 related to initial patient risk assessment, 17 to risk monitoring, 11 to risk prevention. During the clinical performance assessment a total of 82 cases were observed. Birth attendants' adherence to clinical standards was lowest in relation to risk monitoring processes. In relation to major complications, routine care processes addressing fetal and newborn distress were performed relatively consistently, but there were major gaps in the performance of routine care processes addressing bleeding, infection, and pre-eclampsia risks. The identified set of <b>process</b> <b>indicators</b> could identify major gaps in the quality of obstetric and neonatal care provided during the intra- and immediate postpartum period. We hope our suggested indicators for essential routine care processes will contribute to streamlining MNH program evaluations in LMICs...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} quality schooling {{as defined}} by constructivist criteria, and it identifies and exemplifies <b>process</b> <b>indicators</b> of quality schooling. The framework for presenting and operationalizing the <b>process</b> <b>indicators</b> is based on Eisner 2 ̆ 7 s five dimensions of schooling: intentional, structural, curricular, pedagogical, and evaluative. This study focuses on how students learn and construct meaning through {{the goals of the}} school, the organization of the school, its curriculum, its pedagogy, and its program evaluation. ^ Three Blue Ribbon public high schools in Connecticut are studied and from their stories, examples of <b>process</b> <b>indicators</b> of quality schooling are identified. Themes and theme indicators have also emerged from the data. Elite, in-depth interviews, classroom observations, and a review of school documents provide the data, answer the research questions, and convey the essences of the high schools included in this study. The results of this study will inform school improvement initiatives and program evaluations. ^ Some of the more significant findings of this study are the identification of the following process indicators: concerning the intentional dimension—institutional mastery, mental models, and a shared vision; concerning the structural dimension—organizational scheme, ability to build capacity, and use of time; concerning the curricular dimension—curriculum planning, content of the curriculum, opportunities to learn, and curriculum oriented towards the future; concerning the pedagogical dimension—a variety of teaching strategies and settings, accommodation of student learning styles, student engagement, teaching as a naturalistic endeavor, the art of teaching, and teaching as a personal statement; and concerning the evaluative dimension—functions of educational evaluation, content of the evaluations, quality of the evaluation reports, and a shift from evaluation to assessment. ^ Future research may want to examine more fully the relationship among the identified <b>process</b> <b>indicators.</b> Researchers may want to examine the relevancy of these <b>process</b> <b>indicators</b> to other types of high schools, e. g. virtual, alternative, charter, and magnet schools, or to elementary and middle school settings. Still other researchers may want to further explore the relationship between <b>process</b> <b>indicators</b> and student achievement. Finally, another avenue for future research is the impact of school size and school finance on quality schooling. ...|$|R
