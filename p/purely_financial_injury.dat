5000|$|Human capital {{efficiency}} {{describes the}} type and level of individual(s) required {{to participate in the}} process. While human capital costs can be partially captured in <b>purely</b> <b>financial</b> terms, intangible opportunity costs must also be captured. In other words, if the program relies too heavily on senior executive time and focus, it may represent more than just <b>purely</b> <b>financial</b> costs (salary, benefits, and other overhead). An organization must also recognize the intangible costs of the loss of executive time and focus on other strategic objectives such as growth, profitability, talent retention, and customer loyalty.|$|R

50|$|A recent {{empirical}} {{study has}} examined {{the degree to which}} European incumbent firms emphasize on strategic and financial objectives. Results show that 54% of European parent firms invest primarily for strategic reasons, yet with financial concerns, 33% invest primarily for financial reasons with strategic concerns and 13% invest <b>purely</b> <b>financial.</b> None invest solely for strategic rationals. In comparison with an American study, results show significant differences in investment styles. In fact, 50% of US parent firms invest primarily strategic with financial concerns, 20% financial with strategic concerns, 15% <b>purely</b> <b>financial</b> and 15% <b>purely</b> strategic. As a rule, incumbent firms, whether European or American, invest primarily for strategic reasons.|$|R

40|$|Mergers are the {{combining}} {{of two or}} more {{firms to}} create synergies. These synergies may come from various sources such as operational synergies come from economies of scale or financial synergies come from increased value of securities of the firm. There are vast amount of studies analysing operational synergies of mergers. This study analyses the financial ones. This way the dynamics of <b>purely</b> <b>financial</b> synergies can be revealed. <b>Purely</b> <b>financial</b> synergies can be transformed into financial instruments such as securitization. While analysing financial synergies the puzzle of distribution of financial synergies between claimholders is investigated. Previous literature on mergers showed that bondholders may gain more than existing shareholders of the merging firms. This may become rather controversial. A merger may be synergistic but it {{does not necessarily mean that}} shareholders' wealth will increase. Managers and/or shareholders are the parties making the merger decision. If managers are acting to the best interest of shareholders then they would try to increase shareholders' wealth. To solve this problem first the dynamics of mergers were analysed and then new strategies developed and demonstrated to transfer the financial synergies to the shareholders.
