40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of the skin preservation type against shrinkage temperature of leather. The material used in this study was the skin of pufferfish (Arothon reticularis) that have been preserved by salting, formaldehyde and <b>pickling</b> and also <b>raw</b> <b>skin</b> as a reference. The method used to measure the shrinkage temperature was thermal analysis using Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) that operated from 4 °C up to 440 °C with nitrogen stream. DSC measurement results showed that shrinkage temperature of puffer fish preserved with formaldehyde was higher than salting and pickling, which is 63. 64 °C; 47. 95 °C; 57. 37 oC respectively. The advantage of using formaldehyde compared to others preservation technique was not only can protect the skin from damage by microorganisms, but also can create a bond with the collagen. ...|$|R

40|$|What {{the present}} paper deals with, of chiefly the researching-results {{concerning}} the properties of shark-skin put under the tanning process. ""I. Effect of liming on the fish-skin. The amount of the nitrogenous compounds dissolved out into the lime-water from the shark-skin in the liming, increased in parallel with the time of liming, with no relation with the volume of lime-water. The amount of ammonia-N and amide-N dissolved out from the shark-skin was about two {{times as much as}} that from the cattle hide. The contents of amide-N and diamino-N in the limed shark-skin were less than those of <b>raw</b> <b>skin,</b> while the contents of mono amino-Nshowed increasing tendency. ""The detection of almost every kind of amino acid was possible in the lime-water used for liming. In general, the amino acids in the shark-skin dissolved out faster than those in the cattle-hide. Glycine, aspartic acid and alanine were apt to become free from the skin. The release existence of proline and hydroxyproline suggesting the decomposition of collagen was obserbed revealed in case of the shark-skin on the 7 th and 10 th day in the liming, while in case of the cattle-hide it was marked on the 17 th day weakly. The contents of hydroxyproline and arginine in the shark-skin decreased and those in the lime-water increased gradually, after the 7 th day. Accordingly, it was clarified that the liming of shark-skin should be kept in the peried from 7 to 10 days at about 23 °C. Before the occurrence of rapid decrease in the contents of hydroxyproline in the limed skin collagen, no change the hydrothermal shrinking temperature (Ts) could be observed. Ts. of limed skin and that of delimed skin were observed to be not so high as that of <b>raw</b> <b>skin,</b> but Ts. of leather was always considerably higher than that of <b>raw</b> <b>skin.</b> From the above mentioned resalts it was presumed that the liming process should haveconsiderable effects on the skin, namely, the removal of unavilable protein; the swell and exposure of collagen; the increase of reactivity of skin to tan agent and the elevation of Ts. of leather. In addition, it was confirmed that the day sneeded for the liming of shark-skin were far shorter than those for cattle hide. ""II. Changes of lipid in fish-skin. The changes in the contents of lipid in the skin under the tanning process, especially the pickling process, were studied, mainly, with blue-fin-tuna-skin having much lipid. Lipid contents in the skin under the liming process decreased in parallel with the time of liming. Only about 15...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a new method for creating self-adaptive seeds for spatial-based skin segmentation. From the seeds, the ‘skinness’ is propagated either using the <b>raw</b> <b>skin</b> probability obtained from a global skin color model or using the probability computed in the DSPF space. Our extensive experimental study demonstrated that the DSPF domain is less sensitive to the method’s parameters and outperforms all of the investigated methods both for the ECU and HGR data sets, except for our earlier face-based adaptation [11]. The raw probability domain is much more sensitive, which {{makes it difficult to}} tune; however, in some cases (for the ECU set), it delivered better results than the DSPF and also it is much less time consuming. Overall, we found it worth being reported as well.|$|R
50|$|This {{treatment}} {{works in}} many ways. First, shampooing cleans {{the area of}} any contaminants, remove a lot of loose hair and scabs, and the rubbing stimulates the circulation. The neem is an antifungal agent, and works to eliminate the bacteria that cause the infection. It soothes the irritation in the area, and its greasiness provides the ideal environment for the <b>raw</b> <b>skin</b> to heal and grow new hair. It also helps to soften and lift the scabs. The new hair cannot grow in until those scabs are removed from the surface, {{but they are very}} painful to pick and remove, and most horses are intolerant of this procedure. After the neem has soaked into these scabs they will come away much more freely, and soon new hair will grow through.|$|R
