25|$|Multiple {{solar cells}} in an {{integrated}} group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a solar <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>panel</b> or solar photovoltaic module. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor wafers. Solar cells are usually connected in series and parallel circuits or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual power boxes are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs (maximum power point trackers) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt diodes can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Solar {{power is}} {{one of the fastest growing}} sources of {{renewable}} power in the world today. The word “photovoltaic ” is a combination of two words “photo”, meaning light, and “voltaic”, meaning electricity. Therefore photovoltaic technology, the scientific term used to describe solar energy, involves the generation of electricity from light. During the last years rapidly increased the number of photovoltaic sources in Slovak republic. By the increasing numbers of photovoltaic sources also increased the numbers of installed <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>panels</b> in Slovak republic. <b>Photovoltaic</b> <b>panels</b> contents valuable materials. These valuable materials will become interesting at the life end of <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>panels</b> [8]...|$|R
