(a) This visitor starts a tutorial video by pushing a kickable from pause to play. (b) Another visitor scrubs through a different video. (c) This visitor assembles a water molecule by moving a red hydrogen atom towards a blue oxygen atom. We introduce the concept of tangibles that users manipulate with their feet. We call them kickables. Unlike traditional tangibles, kickables allow for very large interaction surfaces as kickables reside on the ground. The main benefit of kickables over other foot-based modalities (e. g., foot touch), is their strong affordance, which we validate in two user studies. This affordance makes kickables well-suited for walkup installations, such as tradeshows or museum exhibits. We present a custom design as well as five sets of standard kickables to help application designers create kickable applications faster. Each set supports multiple standard controls, such as <b>push</b> <b>buttons,</b> <b>switches,</b> dials, and sliders.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the deacclimatization of the {{cutaneous}} thermal sensations of tropical indigenes residing in temperate climates. Tropical indigenes (n= 13) who were born and raised in tropics but had resided in Japan for 5 ??? 61 months participated in this study, along with temperate indigenes (n= 11). Their cutaneous thermal thresholds for warm, cool, hot, and cold sensations were measured in 12 body regions using a thermal stimulator controlled by a Peltier element and a <b>push</b> <b>button</b> <b>switch.</b> Subjects pressed the button-switch as soon as they perceived a feeling of being ???slightly warm???, ???slightly cool???, ???hot???, or ???cold??? from a neutral thermal state. Our results showed that: (1) among the tropical indigenes, no significant relationship was found between the duration of their stay in Japan and their cutaneous thermal thresholds; (2) the tropical indigenes were, on average, 3. 3, 3. 5, 4. 2, and 7. 3 ??C less sensitive to warm, hot, cool, and cold sensations, respectively, than the temperate indigenes (P< 0. 05); and (3) the inter-threshold sensory zones between cutaneous warmth and coolness, and hot and cold sensations were wider among the tropical indigenes than among the temperate indigenes. It was concluded that the nature of the heat acclimatization of the cutaneous thermal thresholds for the tropical indigenes was retained despite their residence in a temperate climate for up to 61 months, indicating that they had more blunted perceptions of both warming and cooling than the temperate indigene...|$|E

The sensor includes a sensor module and a data acquisition module, both {{of which can be}} operated independently of one another or in combination with one another. The sensor module includes a housing containing the mirror, an LED assembly for illuminating the mirror and an optical detector assembly for detecting light scattered off of the mirror by dust or other particles collected thereon.

A <b>push</b> <b>button</b> <b>switch</b> is also mounted on the housing which permits manual initiation of a measurement.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis presents {{a model of the}} complete Electro Discharge Machining (EDM) system and the design and implementation of a digital controller for the servomotor control and the gap voltage and current pulse power generator. A Matlab/Simulink simulation is used to investigate the EDM system model behaviour and based on the simulation results, a compensated EDM control system is designed. Simulation studies were also earned out to predict the material removal rate of a steel workpiece in mm 3 /min. The control software of the EDM control process and servo system control was performed mainly in software with minimal hardware implementation. The control hardware consists of an eZdsp, userinterface device and analogue signal processing and interfacing circuit. The eZdsp communicates with the user-interface device by sending the information/instruction to the LCD screen while the user-interface device uses <b>push</b> <b>button</b> <b>switches</b> to communicate with the eZdsp. It is shown that one DSP microcontroller can be used to provide the control functions for the EDM system. The experimental studies of the Electro Discharge Machining process using a copper electrode, a graphite electrode and steel workpiece materials are presented in tabular and graphical forms. The analysis of the experimental results show that the material removal rate is influenced by the process parameters such as the gap current Igap• gap voltage V arc. pulse on-time Ion, and sparking frequency F, as well as the material properties of the electrode and the workpiece. Comparison studies between simulation and experimental results show reasonable agreement. Further improvement was made to the EDM process model based on the comparison studies. As a result, the predicted material removal rate using the improved EDM process model shows better agreement with experimental results...|$|R

40|$|Oaky Creek Coal Mine uses Jiffy Drive Conveyors {{to extend}} the {{production}} and development conveyor systems underground temporarily whilst waiting for permanent conveyor systems to be manufactured. The existing Jiffy Drive starters are enclosed in a flameproof enclosure that conformed to AS 3800 which was needed when located in ERZ (Explosive Risk Zone) designated areas. Additionally an Austdac control panel had to be mounted separately to the starting panel in a NERZ (Non Explosive Risk Zone) as it was not located in a flameproof enclosure. Due their age and changes in mining technology Oaky Creek Coal {{decided it was time}} to overhaul one of their Jiffy Drive Conveyor starting panels named JD 21 into an IP 56, 316 stainless steel enclosure that also incorporated the Austdac control system. Because of the high standard of work and vast industry experience Comlek was chosen to overhaul the design, manufacture and factory acceptance test (FAT) JD 21. With JD 21 in this configuration it will result a modern, reliable product that does not require constant maintenance to ensure that it conforms to the flameproof standard. The main objective for the project is to design a new enclosure for JD 21 that segregates the incoming mains circuit breaker and the control system out of 316 stainless steel. As a part of the new design JD 21 will make use of a PLC that will reduce the number of components required in the control circuit.
