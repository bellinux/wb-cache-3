50|$|A <b>prompt</b> is a cue or {{assistance}} {{to encourage the}} desired response from an individual. <b>Prompts</b> are often categorized into a <b>prompt</b> hierarchy from most intrusive to least intrusive. There is some controversy about what is considered most intrusive: physically intrusive versus hardest <b>prompt</b> to fade (i.e., verbal). In a faultless learning approach, <b>prompts</b> are given in a most-to-least sequence and faded systematically to ensure the individual experiences {{a high level of}} success. There may be instances in which a least-to-most <b>prompt</b> method is preferred. <b>Prompts</b> are faded systematically and as quickly as possible to avoid <b>prompt</b> dependency. The goal of teaching using <b>prompts</b> would be to fade <b>prompts</b> towards independence, so that no <b>prompts</b> are needed for the individual to perform the desired behavior.|$|R
30|$|Significant {{but only}} small {{differences}} across <b>prompts</b> accord well with Weigle (2011), which we reviewed above.

40|$|Using <b>prompts</b> to {{initiate}} behavior {{seems to be}} effective when employed {{as a component of}} a classroom behavior management system. <b>Prompts</b> can remind or guide an individual to perform a desired behavior. In the research, there are 7 different types of <b>prompts,</b> as well as 6 rules to follow when administering <b>prompts.</b> The seven different types of <b>prompts</b> are: 1) verbal, 2) written, 3) material, 4) imitative, 5) physical, 6) pictorial, and 7) gestural. The six rules are: 1) timing is everything, 2) select a location that facilitates good timing, 3) <b>prompts</b> should be specific, 4) the <b>prompt</b> should guide the behavior, 5) <b>prompts</b> should remind people of consequences, and 6) reinforce responding to the <b>prompt.</b> For the poster session we provided a scenario displaying a written <b>prompt</b> in the classroom setting. The research recommends using the system of least <b>prompts.</b> Using <b>prompts</b> in a classroom seems to improve appropriate behaviors and desired responses...|$|R

In the present study, an adapted alternating treatments design was used to compare the effects of using visual (textual) and echoic <b>prompts</b> on acquisition of intraverbal responses (answering questions) by 2 children with autism.

30|$|Because we are {{interested}} in students’ interactions with the tutorial dialogues, it is useful to look at the time spent on <b>prompts</b> and answer correctness for each <b>prompt</b> type. We had expected to find some differences in the distributions of mean <b>prompt</b> reflection times for the different <b>prompt</b> types but this was not the case. While a conceptual <b>prompt</b> may not require the student to read the problem statement or spend time reflecting on their solution, this is expected behaviour when interacting with a reflective <b>prompt</b> for example. The distributions of correct and incorrect answers for reflective <b>prompts</b> are marginally and significantly different, respectively (see Table  2). While these findings are not surprising, it is interesting that this is the only <b>prompt</b> type with differences between the two groups.|$|R
