40|$|Introduction: The {{discovery}} of penicillin, {{in the late}} 1920 s, revolutionized science and brought medicine into the modern era. Since then, many other antibiotics appeared on the market. Nowadays, {{one of the biggest}} problems in medicine is the indiscriminated use of antibiotics, which has led to the emergence of resistant bacteria. In this context, an appropriate use of antibiotics is essential to the maintenance of their own effectiveness. There are very few studies on antibiotic prescription from <b>Paediatric</b> Emergency <b>Services</b> in Portugal. Objective: Characterize oral antibiotics prescription in our <b>Paediatric</b> Emergency <b>Service</b> Unit. Material and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records from Alert ® computer database of children who attended the <b>Paediatric</b> Emergency <b>Service</b> Unit a randomly chosen day a month (a total of 30 days), from January 2008 to June 2010. Results: During the study period, 4317 children (meaning 144 children/day) were observed in the <b>Paediatric</b> Emergency <b>Service</b> Unit. Oral antibiotics were prescribed to 400 children (9, 3 %). The amoxicillin was the most prescribed antibiotic and acute otitis media was the most common diagnosis. Discussion: We concluded that there is a good balance in the prescription of oral antibiotics in our <b>Paediatric</b> Emergency <b>Service</b> Unit. Nonetheless, we propose some actions to improve oral antibiotic prescription...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{psychiatric}} morbidity is common amongst paediatric patients, {{little is known}} about the availability of CAMH <b>paediatric</b> liaison <b>services.</b> Method: We surveyed all Trusts with specialist CAMH <b>services</b> and <b>paediatric</b> units in Greater London, enquiring about the nature of liaison that CAMHS provide. Results: We found that although liaison paediatric work was common, dedicated <b>paediatric</b> liaison <b>services</b> were provided by only a minority of specialist multidisciplinary CAMHS. Their work involved most aspects of child psychopathology, and included emergencies and children with joint physical and psychiatric problems. About 2 / 3 of paediatricians were satisfied with CAMHS liaison services, but virtually all desired to see them developed further. There were few indications of co-ordination between specialist multidisciplinary CAMHS and other <b>paediatric</b> psychosocial support <b>services...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, a rapid {{increase}} {{has been observed}} {{in the number of}} dentists due to establishment of a number of dental colleges in Pakistan. Very few of these institutions have Paediatric Dentistry Department. Similarly, no postgraduate Paediatric Dentistry training program exists in the two major provinces of the country. The objectives of this study were to map the pattern of <b>paediatric</b> dentistry <b>services</b> provided by the clinicians in teaching institutions and private practices. A cross-sectional study was conducted at dental departments of academic institutions and selected dental practices in Karachi. There was a statistically significant difference in preferences, selection of dental materials and pattern of <b>paediatric</b> dentistry <b>services</b> provided by the teaching dentists compared to the private practitioners.

40|$|Clostridium difficile is {{recognised}} worldwide as {{the main}} cause of infectious bacterial antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in hospitals and other healthcare settings. The aim {{of this study was to}} first survey C. difficile prevalence during the summer of 2014 at the Central University Hospital of Asturias (Spain). By typing the isolates obtained, it was then possible to compare the ribotype distribution at the Spanish hospital with results from the St Luc University Hospital in Belgium over the same period. The prevalence of positive cases reported in Spain and Belgium was 12. 3 % and 9. 3 % respectively. The main PCR-ribotypes previously described in Europe were found in both hospitals, including 078, 014, 012, 020 and 002. In the Spanish hospital, most of the C. difficile-positive samples were referred from oncology, acute care and general medicine services. In the Belgian hospital the majority of positive samples were referred from the <b>paediatric</b> <b>service.</b> However, a high percentage of isolates from this service were non-toxigenic. This study finds that the presence and detection of C. difficile in <b>paediatric</b> and oncology <b>services</b> requires further investigation. Peer reviewe...|$|R
