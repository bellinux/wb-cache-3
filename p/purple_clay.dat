30|$|The profile near Sinapovska River (SR- 1) {{includes}} about 5 [*]m of sandstones {{with three}} layers of about 0.5 [*]m of green to <b>purple</b> aleuritic <b>clays,</b> followed by 5 – 10 [*]m of cross-bedded sands (for details see Ivanov et al. 2007 c). Leaf imprints and pollen {{have been found in}} the clay layers. The sedimentological analysis of the flora-bearing sediments (Ivanov et al. 2007 c) explains the conditions for the accummulation of sediments and for the preservation of the fossil material. Good preservation of plant debris is related to the relatively rapid sedimentation (accumulation) rate of the alluvial clay material in which they were deposited. This material underwent significant compaction due to the pressure of the overlying sediments. But the high sedimentation rate is inappropriate for the accumulation of sufficient pollen, which is why the established pollen complexes are comparatively pure.|$|R

Samples of clays {{were collected from}} three locations in Nigeria and experimental tests were carried out as regards their physical and bulk properties. From the experimental findings {{it was discovered that}} Ire <b>clay</b> (golden), Ire (<b>purple)</b> and Erusu <b>clay</b> showed appreciable moisture contents ranges from 1. 20 %- 4. 26 %. Also for the chemical composition, all the samples fall under Aluminosilicate type of clay because of their high value of Aluminum Oxide and Silicon Oxide. Lastly, the suitability of these clays for better casting quality were determined, as well as recommendation for its various uses in moulding operation was also considered...|$|R
40|$|The use of clay {{materials}} {{for the production of}} emulsion paints was investigated. Two types of clay: White tinged with <b>Purple</b> and Smooth <b>clay</b> (WSP) and Grey Brown and Coarse clay (GBC), were used for the production of Emulsion Clay Paints (ECP). Conventional Chemical pigmented Paint (CP) was also produced as a control. Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy, (AAS) was used to determine the chemical composition of the clay and the concentration of heavy metals on the paints produced. Total organic content (TOC) and quality control tests were also carried out on the paints. The results of the analysis on the two clay types showed that they contained (45. 26 and 47. 370) % of silicon oxide and (38. 26 and 35. 72) % of aluminum oxide respectively. ECP has TOC values of (0. 34 - 0. 52) % while CP has TOC value of (0. 29 - 0. 31). The cost per litre of CP was (N 262. 17) while that of ECP was (N 111. 64), which is about 50 % lesser. 1...|$|R

40|$|Ancient outwash accumulations, {{deposited}} in Pleistocene with complicated sedimentary characteristics, are {{discovered in the}} midstream valley of Dadu River, Southwestern China. Their sedimentation characteristics are investigated for gaining a deep insight into the dependency of Paleoclimate changes in this area. This is achieved by means of detailed site investigation, sampling and laboratory tests (grain size distribution and Electron Spin Resonance dating tests) for two representative outwash accumulations. Based on the present study, several main conclusions are drown out as follows: 1) The accumulations are composed mainly of coarse soils (coarse fraction is over 50 %) and very coarse soils (coarse fraction is about 20 %– 35 %, and very coarse fraction is over 55 %); 2) The coarse soils are sub-rounded well-sorted and sub-stratified to well-stratified, while the very coarse soils exhibit sub-rounded to sub-angular and poorly-sorted; 3) The accumulations are postulated to have been intermittently {{deposited in}} three time periods. This is evidenced by two layers of weathered/residual <b>clay,</b> <b>purple</b> to brick red in color; and 4) It is inferred that {{the temperature in the}} study area increased over three time periods, i. e., 280 ka B.

40|$|Abstract—Chinese tea {{culture is}} rich in content with a long history, and as an ancient Chinese {{philosophical}} thought, the tea-culture-based “teaism ” spirit is also keeping pace with the times under development and innovation. Tea set is an important content of Chinese teaism, and as a traditional tea set, the <b>purple</b> <b>clay</b> teapot has its own unique and irreplaceable characteristics: (1) The iron-rich <b>purple</b> <b>clay</b> material will generate numerous pores in the firing process, which enables the tea set possessed of both heat and freshness retaining properties and ensures that the tea or foam in <b>purple</b> <b>clay</b> teapot would not go bad after days of storage. This is the advantage that metal container, porcelain and other ceramics do not have. (2) Upon natural weathering and artificial selection, the <b>purple</b> <b>clay</b> teapot has possessed strong plasticity, which ensures that all <b>purple</b> <b>clay</b> teapots, no matter plain geometrical ones or fancy ones, are able to excellently represent the authors ’ thoughts and unique aesthetic appreciation. Pottery makers in Yixing had made further development based on the shape of bronze and porcelain wares, while masterpieces of masters including Gong Chun, Shi Dabin, Chen Mingyuan, Chen Hongshou, Yang Pengnian, Shao Daheng, Gu Jingzhou and so on {{from generation to generation}} had made the purply clay teapot, a practical utensil, possessed of art taste and ornamental value. (3) The participation of literati in the style design and inscription decoration of <b>purple</b> <b>clay</b> teapot makes the teapot possess dense cultural flavor and bear more profound cultural content as well as connotation of Chinese traditional culture and ethnic art culture essence. However, the <b>purple</b> <b>clay</b> teapot with inscription decoration also possesses the unique characteristics of cultural carrier and ideological connotation.

40|$|The Eastern Aysen Region of Patagonian Chile from 45 °- 47 °S is characterised by Jurassic and Cretaceous silicic {{volcanic}} and volcaniclastic terrestrial rocks which outcrop on {{the eastern}} slopes of the Andes, In the Puerto Ibánez area, 46 ° 10 'S 72 ° 00 'W, the Jurassic rocks have been mapped at 1 : 50, 000 scale to determine new information on their stratigraphic relationships, The Late Jurassic Ibánez Formation rests on strongly deformed pelitic schists of probable Palaeozoic age, and reaches a maximum thickness in excess of 1000 m within the area studied, Calc-alkaline silicic tuffs and ignimbrites dominate the Ibánez Formation. Extrusive lavas are less common, but areas of dacitic to rhyolitic lavas and domes occur, as do minor andesitic lavas and pyroclastic rocks. Ignimbrites {{in this area are}} generally 5 - 20 m thick, although some units show ponding in excess of 100 m. Most are massive units, with simple cooling features, and columnar jointing is rare. Intercalated with the tuffs and ignimbrites are fluvial deposits, mass flow deposits and laminated pelites, as well as breccias, lithic tuffs and other volcaniclastic units, Ibánez Formation rocks are moderately deformed by normal, oblique and reverse block faulting, although folding is rare. Locally below the upper contact with the marine sediments of the Lower Cretaceous Coyhaique Group, Ibánez Formation rocks are weathered to a distinctive <b>purple</b> <b>clay</b> and deeply eroded. Infilling this apparent palaeotopography are later Ibánez Formation andesitic lavas, some pyroclastics and a rhyolitic dome, with all in turn overlain by the Lower Cretaceous Coyhaique Group and/or the Divisadero Formation. The Coyhaique Group in the Ibánez area consists of the Katterfeld Formation of blackshales and the Apeleg Formation of tidal shelf, beach and deltaic sandstones, although outcrop is patchy and both formations are absent in some areas. Both formations of the Coyhaique Group are shown to rest unconformably on the Ibánez Formation, and show gradational internal contacts {{with each other and with}} the overlying Divisadero Formation. The Divisadero Formation is dominantly a floodplain volcaniclastic sandstone unit with basal deltaic and redbed sequences, followed by a main body of thick tuffaceous sandstones with intercalated calc-alkaline rhyolitic tuffs and ignimbrites. Measured sections from the Puerto Ibánez Quadrangle, Cerro Montreal and Cerro Divisadero are presented to demonstrate the distal nature of the Puerto Ibánez outcrops of Divisadero Formation units when compared with those exposed in the Coyhaique region, Stratigraphically above the Divisadero Formation are coeval Plateau Basalts and the peralkaline rhyolite lavas of the Cerro Pico Rojo dome complex, both of which are of uncertain age and may date from the late Cretaceous to Tertiary, although a Miocene age is most likely. The Mesozoic calc-alkaline silicic volcanic units and the Coyhaique group are intruded by calc-alkaline granodiorites and a mixed population of minor hypabyssal intrusions of dominantly calc alkaline affinity, although alkaline and peralkaline rocks also occur. Geochemical data for all mapped igneous formations are presented, and radiometric Ar-Ar analyses for representative samples of the Ibánez Formation, Divisadero Formation and the granodioritic intrusive rocks are presented. The Ibánez Formation, although still included as part of the huge silicic Chon Aike Province erupted in the Middle Jurassic, is confirmed to be significantly younger than the main Chon Aike Province and to have a closer affinity to volcanic arc activity on the Pacific rim of Gondwana than to earlier within-plate silicic magmatism of the continental interior. The granodiorites are shown to be of mid Cretaceous Albian-Turonian age, while dating of the Divisadero Formation at Cerro Divisadero proved to be inconclusiv...|$|E
