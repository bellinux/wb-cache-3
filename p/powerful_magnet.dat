500|$|In the triplet form, [...] {{molecules}} are paramagnetic. That is, they impart {{magnetic character}} to oxygen {{when it is}} {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field, because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule, and the negative exchange energy between neighboring [...] molecules. Liquid oxygen is so magnetic that, in laboratory demonstrations, a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a <b>powerful</b> <b>magnet.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An {{electromagnet}} {{is a type}} of magnet {{in which}} the magnetic field is produced by an electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current is turned off. Electromagnets usually consist {{of a large number of}} closely spaced turns of wire that create the magnetic field. [...] The wire turns are often wound around a magnetic core made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material such as iron; the magnetic core concentrates the magnetic flux and makes a more <b>powerful</b> <b>magnet.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Currently most {{samples are}} {{examined}} {{in a solution}} in water, but methods are being developed to also work with solid samples. Data collection relies on placing the sample inside a <b>powerful</b> <b>magnet,</b> sending radio frequency signals through the sample, and measuring the absorption of those signals. Depending on the environment of atoms within the protein, the nuclei of individual atoms will absorb different frequencies of radio signals. [...] Furthermore, the absorption signals of different nuclei may be perturbed by adjacent nuclei. [...] This information {{can be used to}} determine the distance between nuclei. [...] These distances in turn can be used to determine the overall structure of the protein.|$|E

60|$|It {{was very}} simple. When the {{curtains}} were closed Leo {{came forward and}} concealed himself under the table. He had a <b>powerful</b> <b>magnet,</b> and wherever he pushed the magnet under the table the bit of metal {{on top of the}} table was sure to follow.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time since I had known Theodore Watling, however, I saw him in the shadow of another individual; a man who, like a <b>powerful</b> <b>magnet,</b> {{continually}} drew our glances.

The various experiments {{which have been}} made with <b>powerful</b> <b>magnets</b> upon such metals, as copper, silver, and generally those substances not magnetic, prove this point; for the substances experimented upon, if electrical conductors, must have acquired this state; and yet no evidence of attractive or repulsive powers has been observed. I have placed copper and silver discs, very delicately suspended on torsion balances in vacuo near to the poles of very <b>powerful</b> <b>magnets,</b> yet {{have not been able}} to observe the least attractive or repulsive force.|$|R

60|$|The {{explanation}} was simple. Under the stool Carl had a <b>powerful</b> <b>magnet</b> {{connected with the}} electric current which served the mansion with lights.

A {{soft iron}} {{cylinder}} was then covered with paper {{at the middle}} part, and the twisted portion of the above compound wire coiled as a spiral around it, the connexion with the galvanometer still being made at the ends A and B. The iron cylinder was then brought {{in contact with the}} poles of a <b>powerful</b> <b>magnet</b> capable of raising thirty pounds; yet no signs of electricity appeared at the galvanometer.

6000|$|... 148. These {{favourable}} results {{led me to}} {{hope that}} the direct magneto-electric induction of the earth might be rendered sensible; and I ultimately succeeded in obtaining the effect in several ways. When the helix just referred to (141. 6.) {{was placed in the}} magnetic dip, but without any cylinder of iron or steel, and was then inverted, a feeble action at the needle was observed. Inverting the helix ten or twelve times, and at such periods that the deflecting forces exerted by the currents of electricity produced in it should be added to the momentum of the needle (39.), the latter was soon made to vibrate through an arc of 80° or 90°. Here, therefore, currents of electricity were produced by the direct inductive power of the earth's magnetism, without the use of any ferruginous matter, and upon a metal not capable of exhibiting any of the ordinary magnetic phenomena. The experiment in everything represents the effects produced by bringing the same helix to one or both poles of any <b>powerful</b> <b>magnet</b> (50.).|$|E
6000|$|... 87. The {{galvanometer}} {{was roughly}} made, yet sufficiently delicate in its indications. The wire was of copper covered with silk, and made sixteen or eighteen convolutions. Two sewing-needles were magnetized and fixed on to a stem of dried grass parallel to each other, but in opposite directions, {{and about half}} an inch apart; this system was suspended by a fibre of unspun silk, so that the lower needle should be between the convolutions of the multiplier, and the upper above them. The latter was by much the most <b>powerful</b> <b>magnet,</b> and gave terrestrial direction to the whole; fig. 8. represents {{the direction of the}} wire and of the needles when the instrument was placed in the magnetic meridian: the ends of the wires are marked A and B for convenient reference hereafter. The letters S and N designate the south and north ends of the needle when affected merely by terrestrial magnetism; the end N is therefore the marked pole (44.). The whole instrument was protected by a glass jar, and stood, as to position and distance relative to the large magnet, under the same circumstances as before (45.).|$|E
50|$|Another risk {{of these}} <b>powerful</b> <b>magnets</b> {{is that if}} more than one magnet is ingested, they can pinch soft tissues in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract.

25|$|Because the {{intensity}} of nuclear magnetic resonance signals and, hence, {{the sensitivity of the}} technique depends on the strength of the magnetic field the technique has also advanced over the decades with the development of more <b>powerful</b> <b>magnets.</b> Advances made in audio-visual technology have also improved the signal-generation and processing capabilities of newer instruments.|$|R
50|$|MRI is a newer {{technique}} used to diagnose spondylolysis and is favorable {{for a few}} reasons. The MRI is much more accurate than the x-ray and also does not use radiation.

60|$|There is, in lovers, {{a certain}} infatuation of egotism; {{they will have}} a witness of their happiness, cost that witness what it may. Paulina had {{forbidden}} letters, yet Dr. Bretton wrote; she had resolved against correspondence, yet she answered, were it only to chide. She showed me these letters; with something of the spoiled child's wilfulness, and of the heiress's imperiousness, she made me read them. As I read Graham's, I scarce wondered at her exaction, and understood her pride: they were fine letters--manly and fond--modest and gallant. Hers must have appeared to him beautiful. They had not been written to show her talents; still less, I think, to express her love. On the contrary, it appeared that she had proposed to herself the task of hiding that feeling, and bridling her lover's ardour. But how could such letters serve such a purpose? Graham was become dear as her life; he drew her like a <b>powerful</b> <b>magnet.</b> For her there was influence unspeakable in all he uttered, wrote, thought, or looked. With this unconfessed confession, her letters glowed; it kindled them, from greeting to adieu.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{its power}} to produce magnetism," [...] {{continued}} Sam, [...] "was shown by Lord Lindsay's huge electro-magnet. This magnet, you must know, {{is nothing but a}} bit of ordinary metal until it is electrified, when it becomes a most <b>powerful</b> <b>magnet.</b> But the instant the current is cut off from it, it ceases to be a magnet. If you understood much about electricity," [...] said Sam, looking round on his rapt audience, [...] "I might tell you that it is upon this power of making a piece of iron a magnet or not at pleasure, that depend the Morse and Digne telegraph instruments; but as you don't understand, I won't perplex you further. Well, when a piece of sheet copper was passed between the poles of Lord Lindsay's giant magnet, it was as difficult to move {{as if it had been}} sticking in cheese--though it was in reality touching nothing!--influenced only by attraction."

A knowledge of these and other deep things, and of the laws that govern them, has enabled Sir William Thomson and Mr Cromwell F.

50|$|Few {{materials}} {{can be made}} to magnetically levitate stably above the magnetic field from a permanent magnet.

Strongly diamagnetic materials, however, can levitate above <b>powerful</b> <b>magnets.</b>|$|R

50|$|If a <b>powerful</b> <b>magnet</b> (such as a supermagnet) {{is covered}} with a layer of water (that is thin {{compared}} to the diameter of the magnet) then the field of the magnet significantly repels the water.
