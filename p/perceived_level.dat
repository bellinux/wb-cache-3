25|$|Very {{generally}} speaking ethno-racial relations {{can be arranged}} on an axis between the two extremes of European and Amerindian cultural and biological heritage, this is a remnant of the colonial Spanish caste system which categorized individuals according to their <b>perceived</b> <b>level</b> of biological mixture between the two groups. Additionally the presence of considerable portions of the population with partly African and Asian heritage further complicates the situation. Even though it still arranges persons along the line between indigenous and European, in practice the classificatory system is no longer biologically based, but rather mixes socio-cultural traits with phenotypical traits, and classification is largely fluid, allowing individuals to move between categories and define their ethnic and racial identities situationally.|$|E

[...] When research {{participants were asked to}} evaluate a person's facial attractiveness and perceived ambition based on an online dating profile, amount of time permitted for processing and reporting an evaluation of the target produced a difference in impression formation. Spontaneous evaluations relied on physical attractiveness almost exclusively, whereas deliberate evaluations weighed both types of information. Although deliberate evaluations used the information provided on both physical attractiveness and ambition of each target, the particular impact of each kind of information appeared to depend on the consistency between the two. A significant effect of attractiveness on deliberate evaluations was found only when perceived ambition was consistent with the <b>perceived</b> <b>level</b> of attractiveness.

2500|$|The {{realism of}} the viewing {{experience}} in a planetarium depends significantly on the dynamic range of the image, i.e., the contrast between dark and light. This {{can be a challenge}} in any domed projection environment, because a bright image projected {{on one side of the}} dome will tend to reflect light across to the opposite side, [...] "lifting" [...] the black level there and so making the whole image look less realistic. Since traditional planetarium shows consisted mainly of small points of light (i.e., stars) on a black background, this was not a significant issue, but it became an issue as digital projection systems started to fill large portions of the dome with bright objects (e.g., large images of the sun in context). For this reason, modern planetarium domes are often not painted white but rather a mid grey colour, reducing reflection to perhaps 35-50%. This increases the <b>perceived</b> <b>level</b> of contrast.|$|E
40|$|For decades, higher {{education}} institutions have been increasingly reliant upon part-time faculty. As the role of part-time faculty {{in colleges and universities}} has evolved and gained prominence, it is increasingly important to gain a deeper understanding of their perceptions of job involvement considered as potential predictor of turnover and absenteeism. There are very few studies focusing on part-time faculty. Available research tends to be concerned with inequality in terms of income, benefits, working conditions, and opportunities for career advancement compared to full-time faculty, while perceptions of how distributive justice among part-time faculty members might be associated with their <b>perceived</b> <b>levels</b> of job involvement remain comparatively neglected. This study focused on exploring relationships between job involvement and other job-related variables, including <b>perceived</b> <b>levels</b> of distributive justice; whether or not part-time work status was voluntary or involuntary, or the position was primary or non-primary. <b>Perceived</b> <b>levels</b> of overqualified underemployment and perception of empowerment were also considered. The study population was drawn from an existing database. The target population of the study was 165 part-time faculty members in the continuing education field at {{higher education}} institutions in the United States. OLS regression, ANOVA, and path analysis were utilized to explore the relationships between job involvement and the other job-related variables among part-time faculty in the study. The analyses revealed that whether or not part-time work was voluntary, and the position was primary or non-primary did not significantly influence levels of job involvement. Furthermore, perceived distributive justice did not affect part-time faculty job involvement significantly. <b>Levels</b> of <b>perceived</b> distributive justice among part-time faculty members only influenced job involvement through empowerment. Empowering part-time faculty appears to be an essential element in efforts to enhance <b>perceived</b> <b>levels</b> of job involvement among part-time faculty...|$|R

Ultimately, when participants were led to believe their level of depletion was lower than their true state of depletion, they performed much better on a difficult working memory task.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the degree and frequency to which school counselors 2 ̆ 7 utilized accountability measures and deliberate practice {{and their impact on}} <b>perceived</b> <b>levels</b> of counselor self-efficacy, as well as, <b>perceived</b> <b>levels</b> of student academic success. This study attempted to answer several critical questions regarding school counselor accountability and deliberate practice. It assessed the relationship between receipt of formal training in the American School Counseling Association Model (ASCA) or another counseling model and likelihood of using ASCA principles, the relationship between years of work experience and use of accountability measures and deliberate practice, the relationship between use of accountability measures and deliberate practice on <b>perceived</b> <b>levels</b> of counselor self-efficacy, and the relationship between use of accountability measures and deliberate practice on <b>perceived</b> <b>levels</b> of student academic success; that {{is the degree to which}} counselors 2 ̆ 7 believe their services impact students 2 ̆ 7 outcomes. This study included a national sample of 1, 084 currently practicing school counselors who were members of ASCA and responded to a web-based survey on school counselor practices. Three of the four hypotheses were either partially or fully supported and one hypothesis was unsupported by the findings. The first hypothesis was fully supported in that participants who received formal ASCA training were found to be more likely to implement ASCA principles (accountability measures and deliberate practice) on a regular basis. The second hypothesis was unsupported by the findings, which indicated years of accumulative school counseling experience would be positively associated with use of ASCA principles. The third hypothesis was partially supported in that, years of work experience and use of accountability measures would be positively associated with increased <b>levels</b> of <b>perceived</b> self-efficacy, while deliberate practice was found to have no relationship with <b>perceived</b> <b>levels</b> of self-efficacy. The fourth hypothesis was fully supported by the findings in that an inverse relationship was found between years of work experience and student outcomes and a positive relationship existed between use of accountability measures and deliberate practice and student outcomes. Limitations to this study include lack of generalizability, self-reporting, and missing data. The findings of this study can only be generalized to working school counselors who work at the K- 12 level. Additionally, self-reporting was a limitation due to bias and missing data is a limitation due to participants agreeing to participate, starting the survey, but failing to complete the entire survey. Suggestions for future research include conducting other national surveys that incorporate questions asking participants how long they have been following a national counseling framework and if they believe utilizing these ASCA principles improves their work performance. Other future suggestions included conducting studies on the best way to train counselors to use ASCA principles in order to enhance their work performance. Lastly, future studies need to be conducted in order to determine which interventions elicit the most positive outcomes for students to achieve academic excellence. This study also provided contributions to the field of counseling. Results of this study provide insight for working school counselors, counselor education programs, and professional associations regarding the beliefs of school counselors pertaining to the impact that utilizing accountability measures and deliberate practice have on <b>perceived</b> <b>levels</b> of counselor self-efficacy, as well as, <b>perceived</b> <b>levels</b> of student outcomes...|$|R
