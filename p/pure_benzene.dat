In the <b>pure</b> <b>benzene</b> discharge, the emission spectra of benzene are seen at the beginning, and they decrease, then the emission spectra of CH(431. 42 nm), C 2 (468. 02 nm, 516. 52 nm), Hα(656. 28 nm) and Hβ(486. 13 nm), which are regarded as the fragments of benzene, are observed, {{so that it is}} judged that benzene is decomposed by electron impact in the DC glow discharge. In the nitrogen-benzene mixture discharge, the emission spectra of CN(787. 27, 918. 95 nm, etc.) are observed with those of the fragments of benzene and those of nitrogen excited molecules and ions. The emission intensity of CH reaches its maximum first, then the emission intensity of Hα and CN reach their maxima. Therefore, it is likely that benzene is decomposed into CH and other by-product first, then H and CN is created. It is found that the temporal variation of the emission intensity ratio of the first negative (0, 0) band to the second positive (0, 0) band of nitrogen ions and excited molecules, which infers electron mean energy, qualitatively agrees well with that of the decomposition rate of benzene...|$|E

Overall {{it was found}} that the best microfabrication techniques for small scale processes were laser ablation, the LIGA process, soft lithography, and anisotropic wet chemical etching, roughly in ascending order of effectiveness. One of the few viable bonding techniques was found to be diffusion bonding followed by microlamination, whereas many coating methods [...] such as solgel coating, modified anodic oxidation, and electrophoretic deposition [...] were effective in μTAS integration. The high surface area to volume ratio of microreactors enables precise control of the temperature of the reactor along its axial dimension. Taking advantage of this feature in the design of microreactors leads to better control of complex reaction networks and generates more valuable effluent streams.

40|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared {{techniques have}} been applied {{in order to determine}} the optical constants of several liquid and thin-film solid systems over infrared frequencies. In the far infrared region, dispersive interferometry has been employed leading to the derivation of both real and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index in one experiment. As an extension to this, a method has been devised for the analysis of ‘full interferograms' involving multiple internal reflections that inevitably arise for normal transmission through thin parallel specimens. A program has been written which constrcts a theoretical complex insertion loss for the system understudy and then performs an iteration on estimated values for absorption coefficient and refractive index. Results are presented for several liquids analysed using this technique. The bandshapes of <b>pure</b> acetonitrile and <b>benzene</b> have been studied in the far infrared region of the spectrum. This was as a consequence of claims in the literature [83, 84] that discernable structure in such bandshapes indicated the presence of long-ranged order in molecular liquids. Bandshapes have been produced using both non-dispersive and dispersive transmission, and spectra from both experiments have been averaged. These are presented together with the standard deviation on the mean. It is concluded that there is no evidence for real structure above the level of the noise in the spectra. The collision-induced spectrum of iodine in benzene has been studied in the far infrared region. Subsequent analysis has been done in both the frequency domain and the time domain in order to examine the nature of the intermolecular interactions and the time evolution of the relaxation processes. Experimental intensity and second moment data have been found to agree well with those predicted by a theory based only on classical electrostatic forces of attraction. Spectra have been modelled using two approaches for solving the generalised Langevin equation. The fits were found to be reasonable and the fitted parameters have been used to study the interactions involved in the system. A mid infrared study of Langmuir-Blodgett films has been undertaken, involving layers of w-tricosenoic acid on a silicon substrate. Anomalies in the carbonyl intensities for the first few layers have been attributed to the partially polarised nature of the incident radiation, and have been used to study the orientation of the fatty acid molecules relative to the substrate surface.

A less extensive extraction study of iron(III) by tetra-n-heptylammonium chloride (THACl) in nitrobenzene-benzene mixtures was also performed. In addition, a brief study was made of the degree of aggregation of both amine salts in benzene. The results of the extraction study using TOAHCl are interpreted in terms of a phenomenological thermodynamic model which includes the solvation of the primary extracted species by nitrobenzene and by additional TOAHCl molecules in the organic phase. This extraction system was found to be metal concentration independent. It is postulated that the organic phase contains the following metal species: TOAHFeCl 4 •TOAHCl, TOAHFeCl 4 •(TOAHCl) 2, (TOAH+ + FeCl 4) solvated, and TOAHFeC 14 •nøN 02, where n was found to be ca. 3. 0. The thermodynamic quantities, ΔG°, ΔH°, and Δ 5 °, were calculated from the various equilibrium constants and are discussed in terms of molecular interactions. The extraction study carried out using THACl was found not to fit the extraction model proposed for TOAHCl and provided little information because of gross non-ideality of the organic solutions of this salt. On a qualitative basis, the results suggest that the nitrobenzene solvation observed in the TOAHCl system may be due to cation solvation only. The aggregation studies demonstrated that TOAHCl exists as an equilibrium monomer and dimer mixture in dilute solutions (≤ 0. 05 molar) in benzene, while the THACl is very highly aggregated even in dilute benzene solutions (0. 01 M) ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{carotenoid}} {{has been}} {{isolated from the}} chicken retina. It is proposed to call this galloxanthin, from GaUus, the generic name of the fowl, and the suffix-xanthin, which designates carotenoid alcohols or xanthophylls. This substance is interesting physiologically, as a new member {{of a series of}} carotenoid pigments which act as color filters for cone vision in the chicken (Wald and Zussman, 1938). It has an interest also for carotenoid chemistry, since its absorption spectrum lies in a wavelength region wherc with one curious exceptionL-natural carotenoids have not previously been found. Properties Partition. [...] GaUoxanthin is non-saponifiable, and displays no acidic properties. When partitioned between petrol ether and 90 per cent methanol, it goes almost entirely into the lower, alcohol layer (hypophasic). In partition between petrol ether and 80 per cent methanol, it is distributed about equally in both phases. This behavior is characteristic of xanthophylls. Adsorption. [...] Galloxanthin is adsorbed very strongly from its solutions in petrol ether by calcium carbonate. This is another common xanthophyll property. The pigment when purified is adsorbed {{at the top of a}} column of calcium carbonate, and scarcely moves downward on prolonged washing with petrol ether. It does descend slowly on washing with <b>pure</b> <b>benzene</b> (CnH 6). In extracts of chicken retinas, galloxanthin is found mixed with astaxanthin, leaf xanthophylls, and a carotene. In the chromatogram on calcium carbonate, galloxanthin is adsorbed just below astaxanthin and above lutein. It cannot easily be separated from either pigment. All three carotenoids appear to form stereoisomeric sets (cf. Zechmeister, 1944), possibly as a result of extraction procedures, which overlap on the chromatogram. * This investigation was supported in part by the Office of Naval Research, Medical Sciences Division. I wish to acknowledge the skillful assistance of Mr. Paul K. Bro,qa with these experiments. 1 A carotenoid having an absorption spectrum in the same region as that of galloxanthin has recently been found in an artificially induced mutant of the yeast Rhodotorul...|$|E
40|$|Kanda {{has used}} several methods for purifying Cypridina luciferin (1 - 3), {{from the last}} of which he has {{reported}} a crystalline product. His method (2) when repeated with 10 gin. lots concentrated the luciferin from 15 to 30 times. His last method (3) was less successful {{because most of the}} luciferin was extracted from the final benzene solution or oxidized, by the recommended washing with "large amounts " of water. By making use of this extractability of luciferin from benzene solutions or residues by 0. 5 ~ hydrochloric acid instead of water, particularly in the presence of small amounts of ethyl alcohol, and the 10 or 20 to 1 distribution ratio of luciferin between N-butyl alcohol and the acid, preparations 200 or 300 times as active as the initial dry Cypridina were obtained. Results were similar when the luciferin was precipitated from the dilute acid solutions, alcohol free, with an excess of flavianic acid. However, losses from oxidation and incomplete separations were large. Also, although Kanda considered the benzene solubility as good support for his suggestion that luciferin is a phospholipid, it would go into benzene only under limited conditions and much of the behavior indicated that other materials present played an important part both in the transfer into and out of benzene. 1 1 For instance when a benzene solution was shaken with an equal volume of HCI, no alcohol being present, {{less than half of the}} luciferin transferred to the HC 1 during a few minutes of shaking. However, when once in the HC 1 no appreciable quantities have ever been found to transfer back from it into <b>pure</b> <b>benzene.</b> On the other hand although luciferin is extracted much more slowly from the original powder by alcohol than by water, when once extracted the greater solubility in any of the lower alcohols compared with benzene, ether, or aqueous solutions is the most striking solubility characteristic up to any degree of purity so far obtained...|$|E
