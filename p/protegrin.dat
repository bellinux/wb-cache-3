Three were {{identified}} biochemically and {{rest of them}} were deduced from DNA sequences.The protegrins are synthesized from quadiripartite genes as 147 to 149 amino acid precursursors with a cathelin-like propiece. <b>Protegrin</b> sequence is similar to certain prodefensins and tachyplesins, antibiotic peptides derived from the horseshoe crab. Protegrin-1 that consists of 18 amino acids, six of which are arginine residues, forms two antiparallel β-sheets with a β-turn. Protegrin-2 is missing two carboxy terminal amino acids. So, Protegrin-2 is shorter than Protegrin-1 and it has one less positive charge. Protegrin-3 substitutes a glycine for an arginine at position 4 and it also has one less positive charge. Protegrin-4 substitutes a phenylalanine for a valine at position 14 and sequences are different in the β-turn. This difference makes protegrin-4 less polar than others and less positively charged. Protegrin-5 substitutes a proline for an arginine with one less positive charge.|$|E

40|$|The {{interactions}} of the membrane-active peptides alamethicin and <b>protegrin</b> with lipid bilayers are studied. The {{influence of the}} bilayer composition on the orientation transition of alamethicin is studied using oriented circular dichroism. The makeup of the headgroup region of the bilayer is altered while {{the composition of the}} hydrocarbon chains remains constant. When a smaller lipid headgroup is added to the bilayer, the insertion transition shifts to higher peptide concentrations. This can be explained as a reduction of the energy cost of adsorbing the peptide in the bilayer due to the smaller lipid headgroup. The {{interactions of}} the beta-sheet peptide <b>protegrin</b> with model membranes are studied by oriented circular dichroism and lamellar x-ray diffraction. A transition between two states with distinct oriented circular dichroism spectra is observed which {{is a function of the}} peptide concentration and hydration.

We assessed the biological role of <b>protegrins</b> and other elastase-activated polypeptides in the microbicidal activity of neutrophil secretions and inflammatory fluids. When stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), neutrophils generated stable microbicidal activity against both Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes under normal-salt conditions and in the presence of 0 to 10 % serum. The generation of these antimicrobial substances was dependent on neutrophil elastase, since it was inhibited by 1 mM N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val chloromethyl ketone when it was present during activation, but not when this inhibitor was added afterwards. However, elastase-dependent activation of proprotegrins to <b>protegrins</b> in PMA-stimulated neutrophils was not inhibited by the presence of 1 to 2 % serum. Porcine neutrophils also released antibacterial activity during phagocytosis of latex beads, and this too was dependent in large part on elastase-activated polypeptides, including <b>protegrins.</b> Moreover, <b>protegrins</b> were found at bactericidal concentrations in cell-free abscess fluid from naturally infected pigs. Taken together, these studies show that <b>protegrins</b> and other elastase-activated polypeptides are important stable antibacterial factors in porcine neutrophil secretions.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins that constitute a {{first line of}} defense against invading pathogens in the innate immune systems of countless plant and animal species. Their mechanism of action relies to a large extent on selectively disrupting the cell membranes of bacteria, which makes them promising therapeutic agents in the fight against infectious pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. However, AMPs also exhibit toxicity towards mammalian cells, which presents a significant bottleneck in the development of AMPs for antibiotic treatment in humans. Thus, before the full potential of AMPs as therapeutic agents can be unlocked, their fundamental mechanism of action must be understood in order to identify targets for mutation that can improve activity and ameliorate toxic effects. To this end, we carry out computer simulations and modeling studies {{in order to understand the}} interactions of <b>protegrin,</b> a particularly potent and well-studied AMP, with lipid bilayers that mimic the compositions of bacterial and mammalian cell membranes. In particular, we attempt to connect molecular-level thermodynamic information to biologically relevant membrane association equilibria; we elucidate the ion transport characteristics of <b>protegrin</b> pores, and show how the atomistic structure leads to experimentally observed conductance behavior; we provide multi-scale models that can quantitatively link the structure of <b>protegrin</b> and <b>protegrin</b> pores to the leakage of potassium ions from bacterial cells, which appears to be an essential element in the bactericidal mechanism of action of protegrin; finally, we investigate the structure of <b>protegrin</b> pores using molecular dynamics simulations with atomistic resolution. Our work reveals this link for the first time, and provides a united, quantitative connection between molecular-level structural and thermodynamic information and mesoscopic, measurable quantities.

To determine the minimal structure responsible for protegrin-mediated activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, we synthesized 15 <b>protegrin</b> variants and tested them against two well-characterized gonococcal strains. The MICs of PG- 1 were 0. 61 microM (1. 31 microg/ml) for the serum-sensitive strain F 62 and 0. 98 microM (2. 11 microg/ml) for the serum-resistant strain FA 19. Six amino acid residues (Arg 1, Gly 2, Gly 3, Arg 4, Gly 17, and Arg 18) and either disulfide bond could be deleted from PG- 1 without impairing its potency against strain F 62. In contrast, only Gly 17 and Arg 18 could be removed without decreasing its activity against FA 19. <b>Protegrin</b> congener 64 a (PC- 64 a; LTYCRRRFCVTV), a variant of PG- 1 with 12 amino acid residues and one disulfide bond, displayed MICs of 0. 45 microM (0. 68 microg/ml) for strain F 62 and 1. 37 microM (2. 07 microg/ml) for strain FA 19, which approximated those of intact PG- 1. Serum-sensitive sac- 1 + and sac- 3 + transformants of N. gonorrhoeae FA 19 and two FA 19 derivatives with truncated lipooligosaccharide structures were more susceptible to PG- 1 and variants with altered disulfide structures.

Methods The PG- 1 sensitivity/resistance and PG- 1 binding properties of P. aeruginosa and B. cepacia were assessed using radial diffusion assays, radioiodinated PG- 1, and surface plasmon resonance (BiaCore). Results The six P. aeruginosa strains examined were very sensitive to PG- 1, exhibiting minimal active concentrations from 0. 0625 – 0. 5 μg/ml in radial diffusion assays.

Protegrin- 1 (PG- 1) is composed of 18 amino acids with a high content of basic residues and two disulfide bonds. Here we focused on the stability of PG- 1 at the amphipathic interface in lipid bilayers and on the details of the peptide-membrane interactions. We simulated all-atom models of the PG- 1 monomer with explicit water and lipid bilayers composed of both homogeneous POPC (palmitoyl-oleyl-phosphatidylcholine) lipids and a mixture of POPC/POPG (palmitoyl-oleyl-phosphatidylglycerol) (4 : 1) lipids. We observed that local thinning of the lipid bilayers mediated by the peptide is enhanced in the lipid bilayer containing POPG, consistent with experimental results of selective membrane targeting. The β-hairpin motif of PG- 1 is conserved in both lipid settings, whereas it is highly bent in aqueous solution. The conformational dynamics of PG- 1, especially the highly charged β-hairpin turn region, are found to be mostly responsible for disturbing the membrane. Even though the eventual membrane disruption requires PG- 1 oligomers, our simulations clearly show the first step of the monomeric effects.

Two of these mutants were also sensitive to IB- 367 (16 and 128 times more sensitive than the wild type). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profiles of the PM- and protegrin-sensitive mutants demonstrated marked differences in both the lipid A and O-antigen regions, while the PM-sensitive mutants appeared to have alterations of either lipid A or O antigen. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry analysis of the wild-type and PM-sensitive mutant lipid A showed species {{with one or two}} aminoarabinose groups, while lipid A from the PM- and protegrin-sensitive mutants was devoid of aminoarabinose.

40|$|Abstract: Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs) are naturally-occurring {{molecules that}} exhibit strong antibiotic properties against numerous infectious bacterial strains. Because of their unique mechanism of action, {{they have been}} touted as a potential source for novel antibiotic drugs. We present a summary of computational investigations in our lab aimed at understanding this unique mechanism of action, in particular the development of models that provide a quantitative connection between molecular-level biophysical phenomena and relevant biological effects. Our work is focused on protegrins, a potent class of AMPs that attack bacteria by associating with the bacterial membrane and forming transmembrane pores that facilitate the unrestricted transport of ions. Using fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we have computed the thermodynamics of peptide-membrane association and insertion, as well as peptide aggregation. We also present a multi-scale analysis of the ion transport properties of <b>protegrin</b> pores, ranging from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to mesoscale continuum models of single-pore electrodiffusion to models of transient ion transport from bacterial cells. Overall, this work provides a quantitative mechanistic description of the mechanism of action of <b>protegrin</b> antimicrobial peptides across multiple length and time scales...|$|E
40|$|Cathelicidins {{constitute}} {{a family of}} mammalian antimicrobial peptides that are synthesized in the bone marrow as prepropeptides, stored in neutrophil granules as propeptides, and released as active, mature peptides upon neutrophil degranulation. We investigated the developmental expression of two porcine cathe-licidins, PR- 39 and <b>protegrin.</b> Both cathelicidins were expressed constitutively in the bone marrow of all pigs {{at all of the}} ages tested. Peripheral blood neutrophils from young pigs expressed PR- 39 and <b>protegrin</b> mRNA, which were not detectable at 42 days of age. At earlier ages, expression of PR- 39 mRNA was detected in the kidney and liver and several lymphoid organs, including the thymus, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes, but disappeared at 4 weeks of age. These data provide the first evidence of cathelicidin gene expression in peripheral leukocytes and may indicate a role for these antimicrobial peptides in the development of host defense mechanisms. Biological organisms have evolved many strategies to defend against pathogens, but clearly {{one of the oldest and}} most conserved mechanism of host defense is the elaboration of antimicrobial peptides (4, 9). These natural antibiotics are produced by a diverse array of cells and species in both th...|$|E
40|$|AbstractElectron {{microscopy}} and {{atomic force microscopy}} {{images of}} cholesterol-dependent cytolysins and related proteins that form large pores in lipid membranes have revealed the presence of incomplete rings, or arcs. Some evidence indicates that these arcs are inserted into the membrane and induce membrane leakage, but other experiments seem to refute that. Could such pores, only partially lined by protein, be kinetically and thermodynamically stable? How would the lipids be structured in such a pore? Using the antimicrobial peptide protegrin- 1 as a model, we test the stability of pores only partially lined by peptide using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in POPC and POPE/POPG membranes. The data show that, whereas pure lipid pores close rapidly, pores partially lined by <b>protegrin</b> arcs are stable for at least 300  ns. Estimates of the thermodynamic stability of these arcs using line tension data and implicit solvent calculations show that these arcs can be marginally stable in both zwitterionic and anionic membranes. Arcs provide {{an explanation for the}} observed ion selectivity in <b>protegrin</b> electrophysiology experiments and could possibly be involved in other membrane permeabilization processes where lipids are thought to participate, such as those induced by antimicrobial peptides and colicins, as well as the Bax apoptotic pore...|$|E
40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} {{are important}} elements of host defence because of their direct antimicrobial activity and modulatory role in innate immune response. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine whether porcine peptides PR- 39, <b>protegrins</b> (PGs) and low molecular weight extract (LMWE) are able to influence the neutrophil response during bone graft implantation in rabbits. The study was conducted on 10 White New Zealand rabbits and neutrophil activity was assayed on the basis of elastase, myeloperoxidase, and alkaline phosphatase release as well as free radical generation. Our study showed that PR- 39 and PGs inhibited enzyme release from neutrophils except for elastase, which is essential in the first phase of injury. Superoxide and nitric oxide generation under the influence of PR- 39 and PGs were also decreased. Moreover, we found that unlike separated peptides PR- 39 and PGs, LMWE acts proinflammatorily, intensifying the neutrophil secretory response and free radical generation. These results should be taken into account in treatment with natural antimicrobial peptides. The increased neutrophil responses in the first phase of inflammation during surgery may be useful in prevention of infection, but LMWE should not be used in conditions in which excessive neutrophil response is injurious...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTransmembrane pores {{induced by}} {{amphiphilic}} peptides, including melittin, are often modeled with the barrel-stave model after the alamethicin pore. We examine this assumption on melittin by using two methods, oriented circular dichroism (OCD) for detecting {{the orientation of}} melittin helix and neutron scattering for detecting transmembrane pores. OCD spectra of melittin were systematically measured. Melittin can orient either perpendicularly or parallel to a lipid bilayer, depending on the physical condition and {{the composition of the}} bilayer. Transmembrane pores were detected when the helices oriented perpendicularly to the plane of the bilayers, not when the helices oriented parallel to the bilayers. The evidence that led to the barrel-stave model for alamethicin and that to the toroidal model for magainin were reviewed. The properties of melittin pores are closely similar to that of magainin but unlike that of alamethicin. We conclude that, among naturally produced peptides that we have investigated, only alamethicin conforms to the barrel-stave model. Other peptides, including magainins, melittin and <b>protegrins,</b> all appear to induce transmembrane pores that conform to the toroidal model in which the lipid monolayer bends continuously through the pore so that the water core is lined by both the peptides and the lipid headgroups...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Qualitative and {{quantitative}} mass spectrometric studies of biomolecules for example proteins, peptides, or lipids contained in biological samples like physiologic fluids {{are very important}} for many fields of science such as medicine, veterinary medicine, biology, biochem-istry, molecular biology, or environmental sciences. In the last two decades, MALDI TOF MS — matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry, {{proved to be an}} especially conve-nient tool for these analyses. The main advantages of this method are its rapidity and high sensitivity which is particularly appreciated in the case of studies of complex biological specimen. A major challenge for many researchers is to maximize this sensitivity, among others, by appropriate procedures of sample preparation for the measurement. The objective of this work was to optimize these procedures, selecting the optimal matrix and optimum proportions of the sample and the matrix solution in a mixture of both solutions, aiming at the achievement of the maximum intensity of ion current. In this respect, five low molecular mass cathelicidins were studied: prophenin- 2, <b>protegrins</b> 1 – 3, PR- 39. All of them were obtained directly from the porcine blood. As a result of studies, the authors determined such experimental conditions when the intensity of investigated ionic current had the highest value...|$|R
