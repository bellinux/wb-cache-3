The method is to perform the usual calculations for a current life table using the schedule of rates obtained by subtracting the age-specific death rate for the cause to be eliminated from the corresponding death rate for all causes. When the risk <b>of</b> <b>death</b> {{for the cause of}} interest is not too large, the life table produced is comparable to that obtained from the theoretical development of Chiang [1968], involving the recalculation <b>of</b> the conditional <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in each age group to remove the effect of a particular risk <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> The mean value theorem for integrals provides the basis for the approximation; therefore, the approximation will be better with shorter age bands. This application of the theorem is equivalent to assuming exponential survivorship within each age band. For causes <b>of</b> <b>death</b> that are not too common and utilizing five year age bands, the method provides a good approximation to Chiang's approach to the recalculating <b>of</b> the conditional <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> An example is provided that demonstrates very reasonable approximation of the revised, age-specific <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and subsequently calculated age-specific life expectancies. *This research was completed under an Intergovernmental Personnel Act appointment while MJS was on leave from the Department of Biostatistics...|$|R

As a starting point a reference <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> premature <b>death</b> is arbitrarily chosen and two measures of estimating the value of life saving are constructed based on the willingness {{to pay for the}} reduction in the casualty rate. These two measures are derived from the comparison <b>of</b> the <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> premature <b>death</b> before and after the reduction in the casualty rate to the corresponding reference probability.

Finally, we empirically tested both measures {{in the case of the}} Rion-Antirion suspension bridge which will connect the Western part of Greece through the Rion-Antirion sea strait with the region of Patras and consequently with Athens, providing a faster and more efficient service for the passage of the sea strait than the existing obsolete ferry system.

40|$|Objectives: This report {{presents}} period life tables by age, race, and sex for the United States {{based on}} age-specific death rates in 2005. The tables presented {{are based on}} a newly revised methodology. For comparability, all life tables from the year 2000 forward have been re-estimated using the revised methodology and are presented in the "Technical Notes" section. Methods: Data used to prepare the 2005 life tables are 2005 final mortality statistics, July 1, 2005 population estimates based on the 2000 decennial census, and 2005 Medicare data for ages 66 - 100. The methods used to estimate mortality for ages 0 - 65 were the same as those used in annual life tables from 1997 through 2004. The methodology to estimate mortality for the population aged 66 and over was revised in three ways: Medicare data were used to supplement vital statistics and census data starting at age 66 rather than 85, as was done from 1997 through 2004; <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> based on current Medicare data rather than rates <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> based on noncurrent Medicare data were used; and the smoothing and extrapolation <b>of</b> the <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> for ages 66 and over were performed using a nonlinear least squares model rather than a linear model of the rate of change <b>of</b> the <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> for ages 85 and over. Results: In 2005, the overall expectation of life at birth was 77. 4 years, representing a decline of 0. 1 years from life expectancy in 2004. From 2004 to 2005, life expectancy at birth remained the same for males (74. 9), females (79. 9), the white population (77. 9), white males (75. 4), white females (80. 4), the black population (72. 8), and black males (69. 3). Life expectancy at birth increased for black females (from 76. 0 to 76. 1). Life expectancy estimates based on the revised methodology are slightly lower than those based on the previous methodology. For 2005, life expectancy at birth based on the revised methodology was lower by 0. 4 years for the total population. " - p. 1 by Elizabeth Arias, Ph. D.; Brian L. Rostron, Ph.
