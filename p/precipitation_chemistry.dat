This is the initial work indicating the usefulness of a strontium and permanganate precipitation process as applied to the Hanford River Protection Project. Precipitations with both ferric and ferrous iron were shown {{to be at least}} two orders of magnitude less filterable than a 0. 1 gpm/ft target average flux that was desired at the time. A precipitate from a strontium nitrate strike alone was found to filter easily and to make the desired average flux. Other chemistries tested included precipitant of lanthanum(III), nickel (II), calcium (II), and a redox chemistry using sodium permanganate. Of these chemistries a strontium and permanganate strike including calcium provided the highest filter flux compared to the other chemistries. It showed the most promise in lanthanide removal as well. This work provides a promising direction for further work to achieve both acceptable filterability and decontamination for Envelope C wastes to be treated by the Hanford River Protection Project.

Both events are unique without any similar events in terms of dispersion pattern during the more than 2 years of the entire Freja operation, and these events are found during the main phase of major magnetic storms (peak Dst is − 144 nT and − 105 nT).

Changes of the seasonal distribution pattern of the precipitation amounts and a general increase of the air temperature have likely produced an increased weathering which increased the concentration of many inlake solutes and drove the lakes toward more buffered conditions.

Bioindicator species abundances were related to multiple environmental variables to exploit their use as environmental and paleoenvironmental indicators. We collected and analyzed water and surface sediment samples from 63 waterbodies located along a broad trophic state gradient and steep gradients of altitude (~ 0 - 1 560 m. a. s. l.) and precipitation (~ 400 - 3 200 mm/y), from NW Yucatán Peninsula (Mexico) to southern Guatemala. We related 14 limnological variables to relative abundances of 282 diatom species, 66 chironomid morphospecies, 51 species of cladocerans, 29 non-marine ostracode species and six freshwater calanoid copepods. Multivariate statistics indicated that bicarbonate is the strongest driver of chironomid and copepod distribution. Trophic state is the second most important factor that determines chironomid distribution. Conductivity, which is related to the precipitation gradient and marine influence on the Yucatán Peninsula, is the main variable that shapes diatom, ostracode and cladoceran communities.

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{approach was}} taken to examine and test a variety of hypotheses that had been presented or postulated in the literature concerning mercury biogeochemistry in lakes. These hypotheses included: (1) mercury contamination in fish increases with increasing sulphate deposition; (2) mercury exposure in persons eating fish increases with increasing sulphate deposition; (3) mercury contamination in fish is unrelated to natural (non-anthropogenic) Hg sources. These hypotheses were all shown to be false for Ontario lakes, predominantly of the Canadian Shield. Also examined was the spatial association of lake water chemistry with sulphate deposition across Ontario. It was determined that morphometric characteristics of the lakes, as well as watershed buffering capacity, together explained more of the spatial variation in lake water chemistry than did patterns of sulphate deposition across the province. Once these confounding influences were removed, the water chemistry variables most closely reflecting patterns of sulphate deposition were dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and sulphate ion concentration ((SO 42 -)), not pH or alkalinity. Aluminum ion concentration ((Al-)), which is postulated to increase in lakes {{as a result of}} acidic deposition, had no discernible relationship to sulphate deposition. Based on the results of empirical analyses, including path analysis (causal modelling), a complex hypothesis explaining the interrelationships of <b>precipitation,</b> water <b>chemistry,</b> geochemistry, and fish mercury contamination was postulated. Of particular note concerning this model were the following: (1) fish mercury and human mercury exposure decrease as sulphate deposition increases; (2) DOC, not pH or alkalinity, is the water chemistry variable most significantly related to sulphate deposition; (3) DOC, not pH, is the water chemistry variable most significantly associated with fish mercury contamination; (4) causal modelling provided empirical evidence supporting the simultaneous influence of 3 different mechanisms postulated in the literature to control or influence mercury accumulation in freshwater fish...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Travertine {{terracing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} eye-catching phenomena in limestone caves and around hydrothermal springs, but remains fairly poorly understood. The interactions between water <b>chemistry,</b> <b>precipitation</b> kinetics, topography, hydrodynamics, carbon dioxide degassing, biology, erosion and sedimentation constitute a complex, dynamic pattern formation process. The processes can be described and modeled at a range of abstraction levels. At the detailed level concerning the physical and chemical mechanisms responsible for precipitation localization at rims, a single explanation is probably insufficient. Instead, a multitude of effects are likely to contribute, of varying importance depending on scale, flux and other parameters. Travertine terracing is undoubtedly among the most spectacular geological phenomena on Earth. Ranging in vertical scale from millimetres to tens of metres, travertine terraces form intricate, delicate patterns as well as imposing waterfalls. Such ter-races are common not only in limestone caves and around hot springs, but also in streams and rivers in limestone terrain (Pentecost 2005, 59 – 66).
