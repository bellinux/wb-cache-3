5|$|As a wanted criminal, Anarky's {{methods and}} goals were {{described}} as leaving him with little logistical support amongst the heroic community, or the <b>public</b> <b>at</b> <b>large,</b> relegating him to underground operation.

5|$|The oldest writers, Dominicus Lampsonius and Karel van Mander, {{attached}} {{themselves to}} his most evident side, to the subject; their conception of Bosch, inventor of fantastic pieces of devilry and of infernal scenes, which prevails today (1937) in the <b>public</b> <b>at</b> <b>large,</b> and prevailed with historians {{until the last}} quarter of the 19th century.|$|E

His son, Daniel, was born with severe autism; he has lived {{most of his life}} at the Allegheny Valley School, an {{institution}} specializing in intellectual developmental disabilities.

5|$|Despite {{this general}} {{support for the}} concept of wind power in the <b>public</b> <b>at</b> <b>large,</b> local {{opposition}} often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects. For example, there are concerns that some installations can negatively affect TV and radio reception and Doppler weather radar, as well as produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values. Potential broadcast-reception solutions include predictive interference modeling {{as a component of}} site selection. A study of 50,000 home sales near wind turbines found no statistical evidence that prices were affected.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{this period of}} {{unanimous}} passion for Bashō's poems came to an end. Masaoka Shiki, arguably Bashō's most famous critic, tore down the long-standing orthodoxy with his bold and candid objections to Bashō's style. However, Shiki was also instrumental in making Bashō's poetry accessible in English, and to leading intellectuals and the Japanese <b>public</b> <b>at</b> <b>large.</b> He invented the term haiku (replacing hokku) {{to refer to the}} freestanding 5-7-5 form which he considered the most artistic and desirable part of the haikai no renga.|$|E

40|$|Public sector reforms often {{focus on}} high impact {{agencies}} {{in order to}} restore trust in government and in public administration. Using an in-person survey on citizens’ attitudes towards public services, we test what public agencies contribute to citizens’ general image of government. It is shown that general measures of satisfaction with the functioning of public services contain {{more than just an}} evaluation of bureaucratic encounters. Political factors influence this assessment. Specific evaluations of service quality can differ substantially from attitudes towards <b>public</b> services <b>at</b> <b>large.</b> Therefore, low trust in government, a negative attitude towards <b>public</b> administration <b>at</b> <b>large</b> and a positive image of many specific public services may coexist...|$|R

5|$|One art {{historian}} suggests {{the painting was}} influenced by the works of Rosa Bonheur and Gustave Courbet, while another believes it was informed by those of the satirists William Hogarth and Honoré Daumier. The painting's humorous content contributed to its popularity among critics, collectors and the <b>public</b> <b>at</b> <b>large,</b> which led to Predić painting two replicas in 1918 and 1922. By 1890, the original was owned by the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains.|$|E
5|$|Parizeau's stance created {{opposition}} in the sovereignty movement, which coalesced around Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard. A popular and charismatic figure, Bouchard had come close to death from necrotizing fasciitis and lost his left leg. His recovery, and subsequent public appearances on crutches, provided a rallying point for sovereigntists and the <b>public</b> <b>at</b> <b>large.</b> Bouchard thought a proposal lacking a partnership would doom the project among soft nationalists (such as himself) who worried about the economic consequences of separation.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006 Ofcom {{commissioned}} research among {{residents of}} the London boroughs of Hackney, Haringey and Lambeth, finding that about 24 percent of all adults aged 14 or older living within the three London boroughs listen to pirate radio stations. The research found that 37 percent of students aged 14–24 and 41 percent of the African-Caribbean community listened to pirate radio. The development and promotion of grass-roots talent, the urban music scene and minority community groups were identified as key drivers for pirate radio. According to the research both pirate radio listeners and those running pirate radio stations thought that licensed broadcasters failed to cater sufficiently {{for the needs of}} the <b>public</b> <b>at</b> <b>large.</b> Pirate radio was regarded as the best place to hear new music and particularly urban music. Furthermore, pirate radio stations were appreciated for their local relevance by providing information and advertisements about local community events, businesses and club nights.|$|E

5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that the applicant seeks to represent, standing {{can be categorized}} as either private or public standing. Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an applicant who seeks to represent {{the interest}}s of a larger group or the <b>public</b> <b>at</b> <b>large</b> must establish {{he or she has}} public or representative standing. Where private standing is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist: (1) the applicant must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as, to date, no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights, and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further.|$|E

On the other hand, if the Judge allowed it to proceed it would undermine the State's permitting law, which was intended for <b>public</b> safety <b>at</b> <b>large</b> commercial events.
