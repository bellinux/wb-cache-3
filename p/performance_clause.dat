500|$|After {{averaging}} 17points {{per game}} as a rookie and more than 22per game in his second season, Howard became a free agent when the Bullets made some salary cap transactions. The Bullets offered Howard an $89million contract, but the Miami Heat outbid them with a seven-year deal estimated to be worth [...] $98 to $101million. However, according to the NBA league office, the Heat miscalculated their available salary under the salary cap by excluding performance bonuses for Tim Hardaway and P. J. Brown and failing {{to account for the}} impact of renegotiating Alonzo Mourning's contract before coming to terms with Howard. The league rejected the contract on July 31 because Howard's $9million for the 1996–97 season placed the Heat over the cap. Howard then re-signed with the Bullets on August 5. He became the first player in NBA history to sign a contract worth more than $100million; his seven-year contract was worth $105million. The league ruled on August 5 that the Bullets could re-sign Howard after having renounced his rights on July 15 to free up cap room to sign Tracy Murray and Lorenzo Williams if they forfeited their 1997 NBA draft first-round selection rights. The Bullets were not limited by the cap because they were re-signing their own player. The Heat pursued legal remedy in Florida state courts, seeking acknowledgment of the prior validity and superiority of their earlier contract.

[...] Meanwhile, the Heat's contract was protected by a temporary injunction in Florida state court, which forbade any newer contract by Howard from abrogating his Miami contract. The Heat eventually dropped their case but the team, especially head coach Pat Riley, continued to vehemently claim that their case of wrongdoing in the form of erroneous rulings by the league had been very solid. If the Heat had pursued arbitration and had been found guilty of violating the salary cap, the team could have been fined $5million and Heat coach Riley could have been suspended for the season.

40|$|Specific {{performance}} {{is a central}} contractual remedy but, in Anglo-American law, generally is subordinate to damages. The familiar rule is that courts will not award specific performance when damages provide adequate relief. Despite rich theoretical discussions of {{the relative merits of}} specific performance and damages as contract remedies, little is known about parties’ treatment of the remedy in their contracts. We study 2, 347 contracts of public corporations to quantify {{the presence or absence of}} specific <b>performance</b> <b>clauses</b> in several types of contracts (clauses that convey the parties’ intent that the court award specific performance in the event of breach). Although a majority of contracts do not refer to specific performance, substantial variation exists in the rates of including specific <b>performance</b> <b>clauses.</b> These clauses appear in some contracts of every type, but their incidence varies widely: high rates of specific <b>performance</b> <b>clauses</b> are found in the area of corporate combinations through merger (53. 4 percent) and assets sales (45. 1 percent) but much lower rates are observed in loan agreements. It appears, therefore, that treatment of specific performance in sophisticated corporate contracts is more complex than existing theories of contractual remedies allow. We also present results on the associations among contractual acceptance of five default dispute resolution rules: specific <b>performance</b> <b>clauses,</b> arbitration clauses, jury trial waiver clauses, litigation forum clauses, and attorney fees clauses.

40|$|Although Pay for Success (PFS) {{contracts}} {{have received}} widespread {{attention in the}} United States and abroad, there is nothing fundamentally new about governments paying for outcomes. <b>Performance</b> <b>clauses</b> in construction contracts are common, and the Department of Defense has procured services using performance-based contracting for years. Many {{state and local governments}} now use <b>performance</b> <b>clauses</b> in their procurement of human services, for example by providing bonuses to contractors administering job training programs based upon the number of clients who obtain and/or retain jobs.   What makes recent PFS initiatives distinctive is that they are focused not simply on creating additional financial incentives for contractors to produce better outcomes, but more broadly on overcoming the wide set of barriers that are hindering the pace of social innovation. For sure, these barriers include a lack of performance focus and outcome measurement, but they also include political constraints that prevent government from investing in prevention, the inability of nonprofits to access the capital needed to expand operations, and insufficient capacity to develop rapid and rigorous evidence about what works. In some of these new models, the amount of performance risk shifted from taxpayers to those on the hook for producing the outcomes is much greater than under traditional performance contracts, requiring the participation of socially-minded investors to make the projects feasible.   The social impact bond (SIB) is one of the new approaches to financing social innovation. Under the most common SIB model, the government contracts with a private-sector intermediary to obtain social services. The government pays the intermediary entirely or almost entirely based upon achievement of performance targets. Performance is rigorously measured by comparing the outcomes of individuals referred to the service provider relative to the outcomes of a comparison or control group. If the intermediary fails to achieve the minimum performance target, the government does not pay. Payments typically rise for performance that exceeds the minimum target, up to an agreed-upon maximum payment level. Payments are funded at least partially by the cost savings to government achieved through the improvement in outcomes.   The intermediary obtains operating funds by raising capital from independent commercial or philanthropic investors who provide up-front capital in exchange for a share of the government payments that become available if the performance targets are met. The intermediary uses these operating funds to contract with service providers to deliver the interventions necessary to meet the performance targets.   For the past two years, the Harvard Kennedy School’s Social Impact Bond Technical Assistance Lab has provided pro bono technical assistance to several state and local governments as they have developed SIB initiatives. This hands-on involvement informs our research on how governments can foster social innovation and improve the results they obtain with their social spending.   This article describes some of the lessons we have learned about SIBs from our work, focusing in particular on topics where our thinking has changed since our initial analysis of the model. It also describes what we see as the key unanswered questions {{about the future of the}} SIB model...|$|R

There was a general lack of knowledge of the different methods of ADR available.

40|$|The {{last few}} decades have seen {{unprecedented}} levels of change both {{in the production of}} building materials and in the ways they are deployed in building. Despite rigorous debates about materials in architecture from very different areas of theory and practice – ranging from the new materialists’ critique of the concept of matter to ecological concerns with embodied energy and life cycle analysis of building materials – {{the extent to which these}} developments might demand more adequate conceptualisations of materials remains unexplored. The position this research takes is that building materials cannot be assumed to be nothing more than particular instances of matter in general – whether matter is understood in its classical philosophical hylomorphic relation to form, or as the physical substances of science. Here, the architectural specification – a document usually considered to be merely ‘technical’ and therefore outside theoretical enquiry – provides descriptions of building materials drawn from inside architectural practice. It yields a number of types of description – from ‘naming’ to the ‘recipe’ to performance – and the differences between these ‘forms of clause’ and the degree to which each is contained by or exceeds the notion of hylomorphic matter are shown to involve radically different conceptualisations of materials. Moreover, the specification makes visible the changing historical and industrial contexts that constitute its format and content. Part I sets out this variation and constructs a typology of forms of clause, and Part II studies two of them in detail. The key philosophical move derives from Gilbert Simondon’s work on individuation in so far as materials are considered not as substances or as matter (as already individuated individuals) but in terms of the dynamic processes through which they are constituted (individuation). First, process-based clauses provide found descriptions of form taking in terms of such operations, and expand Simondon’s account of the preparations which set up the possibility of individuation in a technical object to include statutory, social and other operations in addition to the physical ones he describes. Second, the <b>performance</b> <b>clause</b> requires us to understand how specific use (excluded by Simondon in his accounts of technical systems) might itself become preparatory in the new industrial conditions of performance-engineered materials. Part III takes up Simondon’s ‘complete system’ of individuation and understands the variety of forms of clause as evidence of a variety of ‘systems of material’ which necessarily include the full range of the preparations which make possible the specific deployment of any given material in building. Furthermore, what is constituted in any individuating system is not so much an individual as the possibility of a transductive mediation between hitherto disparate realities. It is, in particular, the possibilities of new mediations that are produced in industry – between a terrorist threat and a piece of glass – in addition to more familiar ones – between a notion of form and a lump of clay for example, that demand attention and new conceptualisations. For Simondon, transduction is also a process of thought which derives problems and resolutions from within a domain rather than seeking a principle from elsewhere. If we are to understand how concepts emerge from applied practices and their productions, and not just from philosophy and science, then the transductive method has applications well beyond the question of building materials that is put into motion via the architectural specification in the process of this research...|$|E

The case allowed students to understand how clearly written contracts play a deciding&# 13; role in the success of business partnerships. Students practiced negotiation skills while discussing the&# 13; <b>performance</b> <b>clauses</b> of the contract and considering effective amendments to that contract with the&# 13; purpose of extending a business relationship. Approach: The author interviewed a project manager&# 13; working for a preferred implementation vendor which had a contract with a large hospital provider in&# 13; Colorado and California. The purpose of the interview and the case study focused on contract law,&# 13; contract management, enterprise risk management and negotiation skills. The case study is based on&# 13; class room use with practical, real-life contract management scenarios. Results: The team projects&# 13; submitted for this case study in case management highlighted the receptivity of students in&# 13; understanding the benefit of preserving business relationships, avoiding litigation and carefully&# 13; wording the specifics of complex contracts.

The participants consisted of 21 first-year English-speaking learners of Chinese. Both grammaticality judgment (GJ) and oral production (OP) tests were used. Study 1 reports that only attributive wh-questions posed more difficulty to the participants than object wh-questions in OP test at the beginning stage, and adverbial wh-questions and object wh-questions were not found to be significantly different to the participants as reported in some L 1 and L 2 studies. This author attributed this to the different syntactic mechanism that L 2 learners of movement language and learners of in-situ language go through. The initial stage of participants 2 ̆ 7 grammar did not display a clear presence of [+wh] feature strength, and the development of the [-wh] feature strength in learners 2 ̆ 7 L 2 grammar was not linear, but U-shaped. Study 2 reveals that learners 2 ̆ 7 performance on indirect questions and wh-questions in object complements was not as good as their performance on simple wh-questions at the end of first year learning. For indirect questions, the initial stage of participants 2 ̆ 7 L 2 grammar showed an obvious L 1 influence, the embedded [+wh]. For wh-questions in complements, it did not show an L 1 influence, the matrix [+wh], but an embedded [+wh], which is non-target like but resembles wide-scope wh-questions with an embedded [+wh] in Malay and Madurese. Learners 2 ̆ 7 performance on simple wh-questions patterned together with that in matrix clauses of wh-questions in complements, which was better than their <b>performance</b> on embedded <b>clauses</b> of the two types of complex wh-questions.

In this paper we examined changes over the course of development in weighting of acoustic cues at the suprasegmental level. Specifically, we tested English-learning 4 -month-olds’ <b>performance</b> on a <b>clause</b> segmentation task when each of three acoustic cues to clausal units was neutralized and contrasted it with performance on a Baseline condition where no cues were manipulated. Comparison with the reported performance of 6 -month-olds on the same task (Seidl, 2007) reveals that 4 -month-olds weight prosodic cues to clausal boundaries differently than 6 -month-olds, relying more heavily on all three correlates of clausal boundaries (pause, pitch and vowel duration) than 6 -month-olds do, who rely primarily on pitch. We interpret this as evidence that 4 -month-olds use a holistic processing strategy, while 6 -month-olds may already be able to attend separately to isolated cues in the input stream and may, furthermore, be able to exploit a language-specific cue weighting. Thus, in a way similar to that in other cognitive domains, infants begin as holistic auditory scene processors and are only later able to process individual auditory cues...|$|R

We {{point out that the}} selection of the proposing partner is essential for the <b>performance</b> of the <b>clause.</b> Moreover, if partners negotiate for the advantage of being the chooser, then buy-sell clauses result in an ex post efficient outcome. Such endogenous selection is consistent with how buy-sell clauses are drafted in practice.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} still largely unexamined impact of {{multiple}} and conflicting incentives on a manager’s accounting choice as identified by Fields, Lys and Vincent (2001). Using a 2 x 2, between subjects, factorial design, two experiments were conducted using {{a sample of}} 116 Chief Financial Officers (hereinafter, CFOs) from a population of the top 700 companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. The study examines and tests hypotheses relating to incentives {{from each of the}} three classifications used by Fields et al. (2001) : asset pricing, explicit contracting, and implicit contracting (the incentive to influence third parties such as customers, suppliers and employees). Insights were drawn from the disciplines of psychology and management to begin to form an understanding of this complex trade-off decision, and to assist in the development of hypotheses regarding this trade-off. Contrary to expectations based on the volume of financial accounting evidence on the importance of the asset pricing incentive, managers chose to avoid a debt covenant violation rather than meet their asset pricing benchmark when these incentives were in direct conflict. Given a conflict between a <b>performance</b> pricing <b>clause</b> and an implicit contracting incentive to protect their firm’s competitive position in imminent price negotiations, managers again prioritised the explicit contracting incentive. The study also contributes important survey evidence on the attitudes and perceptions of Australian CFOs regarding performance measures reported to stakeholders and the importance of meeting their expectations. This survey partially replicates that of Graham, Harvey and Rajgopal (2005) and as a consequence, offers an interesting comparison of the opinions of CFOs in Australia and the USA. Consistent with the counsel of Chan, Faff and Ramsay (2005), the survey results indicate that it may well be “imprudent to blindly extrapolate US findings to small market settings”. Conditional analysis of the survey responses finds that the characteristics that differentiate the Australian market from the US market (for example firm size and materials industry membership) are associated with differences in opinion between the CFOs in each setting. This study contributes primary evidence on the unexamined area of accounting choice under conflict. Such evidence is novel in that it is achieved with a lesser utilized methodology in response to the observation in Fields, et al. (2001) that research in accounting choice has exhausted certain techniques and would benefit from a fresh approach. Importantly, the theory developed in this thesis draws together insights from multiple disciplines to begin to develop a unified framework for the understanding and evaluation of choices made to satisfy multiple stakeholders. Further, the study contributes valuable insights on the attitudes of Australian CFOs towards performance measures and benchmarks and how these attitudes differ from those in the USA...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{few studies}} that have {{evaluated}} syntax in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have yielded conflicting findings: some suggest that once matched on mental age, ASD and typically developing controls do not differ for grammar, while others report that morphosyntactic deficits are independent of cognitive skills in ASD. There {{is a need for}} a better understanding of syntax in ASD and its relation to, or dissociation from, nonverbal abilities. Aims Syntax in ASD was assessed by evaluating subject and object relative clause comprehension in adolescents and adults diagnosed with ASD with a performance IQ within the normal range, and with or without a history of language delay. Methods & Procedures Twenty-eight participants with ASD (mean age 21. 8) and 28 age-matched controls (mean age 22. 07) were required to point to a character designated by relative clauses that varied in syntactic complexity. Outcomes & Results Scores indicate that participants with ASD regardless of the language development history perform significantly worse than age-matched controls with object relative clauses. In addition, participants with ASD with a history of language delay (diagnosed with high-functioning autism in the DSM-IV-TR) perform worse on subject relatives than ASD participants without language delay (diagnosed with Asperger syndrome in the DSM-IV-TR), suggesting that these two groups do not have equivalent linguistic abilities. Performance IQ has a positive impact on the success of the task for the population with ASD. Conclusions & Implications This study reveals subtle grammatical difficulties remaining in adult individuals with ASD within normal IQ range as compared with age-matched peers. Even {{in the absence of a}} history of language delay in childhood, the results suggest that a slight deficit may nevertheless be present and go undetected by standardized language assessments. Both groups with and without language delay have a similar global <b>performance</b> on relative <b>clause</b> comprehension; however, the study also indicates that the participants with reported language delay show more difficulty with subject relatives than the participants without language delay, suggesting the presence of differences in linguistic abilities between these subgroups of ASD...|$|R
40|$|The {{most notable}} feature of Broca 2 ̆ 7 s aphasia is 2 ̆ 2 agrammatic 2 ̆ 2 speech production, with loss of fluency and {{constriction}} of vocabulary. In addition, some Broca 2 ̆ 7 s aphasics {{have been found}} to exhibit difficulties in sentence comprehension, though the source of their comprehension problems remains controversial. One theory of agrammatism identifies impairment of the syntactic component, predicting errors both in comprehension and production. If there is a central syntactic deficit, then Broca 2 ̆ 7 s aphasics patients would be expected to perform poorly on sentences in which the correct interpretation hinges on a full syntactic analysis, independent of variations in other task demands. They would also be expected to yield a different pattern of errors than Wernicke 2 ̆ 7 s aphasics on sentences with complex syntactic structure. ^ To investigate these predictions the present study tested Serbo-Croatian speaking aphasics (seven Broca-type aphasics with agrammatic output; five Wernicke-type aphasics). The test sentences were semantically reversible relative clauses, which were administered in three different experimental tasks; grammaticality judgments, sentence-picture matching, and judgments of semantic anomaly. Because it minimizes nonsyntactic processing demands, the grammaticality judgment task was expected to provide the most accurate measure of syntactic competence. The sentence-picture matching task was used to provide a basis for cross-task comparison and for comparison with results of previous studies. Judgments on the semantic anomaly task also served for cross-task comparison and as a control for subjects 2 ̆ 7 semantic comprehension of the sentences. ^ The results showed that non-fluent aphasics can process complex syntactic structures, as evidenced by their <b>performance</b> with relative <b>clauses</b> on the grammaticality judgment task. Their rate of successful performance was considerably lower on the other tasks, however. The pattern of errors by Broca-type aphasics closely resembled the pattern displayed by Wernicke-type aphasics and normal subjects. These findings are interpreted as support for the view that comprehension deficits in agrammatism reflect varying degrees of loss of processing ability, but sparing of syntactic knowledge. Although use of grammatical knowledge is impaired in some tasks, it can be exploited successfully in tasks that minimize processing load. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of American jurisdictions {{do not allow}} punitive damages for breach of contract unless the breach constitutes an independent tort. Increasingly, courts and commentators have relied on the theory of 2 ̆ 2 efficient breach 2 ̆ 2 to explain the rule against punitive damages in contracts. In this Article, Professor Dodge argues that economic efficiency supports a different rule-one allowing punitive damages for any willful breach of contract. Willful breaches fall into two categories: those that are 2 ̆ 2 opportunistic 2 ̆ 2 {{and those that are}} 2 ̆ 2 efficient. 2 ̆ 2 An 2 ̆ 2 opportunistic 2 ̆ 2 breach does not increase the size of the economic pie; the breaching party gains simply by capturing a larger share of the pie {{at the expense of the}} nonbreaching party. An 2 ̆ 2 efficient 2 ̆ 2 breach, by contrast, increases the size of the pie, allowing the breaching party to compensate the nonbreaching party and still come out ahead. Deterring opportunistic breaches with the threat of punitive damages is efficient because such breaches by definition do not increase societal wealth. Thus, punitive damages should be routinely available in cases of opportunistic breach, such as pretextual termination, stonewalling, and bad faith refusal to pay a debt. Efficiency also supports extending liability for punitive damages to those breaches that are, in theory, 2 ̆ 2 efficient. 2 ̆ 2 The threat of punitive damages will not require inefficient performance because the potentially breaching party may negotiate with the other party for a release. Relying on Calabresi and Melamed 2 ̆ 7 s distinction between 2 ̆ 2 property rules 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 liability rules, 2 ̆ 2 Professor Dodge shows that requiring the potentially breaching party to negotiate for a release is more efficient than allowing her to breach and pay damages because the transaction costs of negotiation, while not negligible, are generally lower than the assessment costs of litigation. He also explains why other forms of 2 ̆ 2 property rule 2 ̆ 2 protection, like specific <b>performance</b> and penalty <b>clauses,</b> are insufficient to ensure that negotiation occurs before breach...|$|R
