Forward and reverse subtractions were performed, subtraction-enriched products were cloned, and clones were sequenced from both of the resulting libraries. When 27 of these genes were screened by semi-quantitative RT-PCR to identify candidates for differential expression based generally on 2 -fold changes in expression, one encoding FK 506 -binding protein 5 was <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> up-regulated in response to seasonal change, another encoding the mitochondrial solute carrier 25 member 25 (ATP-Mg/Pi carrier) was similarly classified with seasonal change and low temperature shift, and the one encoding the 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein was <b>provisionally</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> down-regulated with low temperature shift.

When first seen (14 Jan. 1970) he had an enormous corneal abscess and ulceration, occupying two-thirds of the corneal surface; this {{was accompanied by a}} hypopyon and severe iritis with posterior synechiae. He was admitted to hospital and, after an abortive attempt to dilate the pupil, was treated with ampicillin 500 mg B-hourly, Neosporin (Burroughs Wellcome and Co.) eyedrops 2 -hourly, and atropine eyedrops three times daily. In hospital the ulcer began to heal from the edges, but the centre became ectatic and on 22 Jan. 1970 a conjunctival flap was placed over the ulcer.

40|$|Harnessing chemosynthetic {{symbionts}} is {{a recurring}} evolutionary strategy. Eukaryotes from six phyla {{as well as}} one archaeon have acquired chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. In contrast to this broad host diversity, known bacterial partners apparently belong to two classes of bacteria - the Gamma- and Epsilonproteobacteria. Here, we characterize the intracellular endosymbionts of the mouthless catenulid flatworm genus Paracatenula as chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing Alphaproteobacteria. The symbionts of Paracatenula galateia are <b>provisionally</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> "Candidatus Riegeria galateiae" based on 16 S ribosomal RNA sequencing confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization together with functional gene and sulfur metabolite evidence. 16 S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis shows that all 16 Paracatenula species examined harbor host species-specific intracellular Candidatus Riegeria bacteria that form a monophyletic group within the order Rhodospirillales. Comparing host and symbiont phylogenies reveals strict cocladogenesis and points to vertical transmission of the symbionts. Between 33 % and 50 % of the body volume of the various worm species is composed of bacterial symbionts, by far the highest proportion among all known endosymbiotic associations between bacteria and metazoans. This symbiosis, which likely originated more than 500 Mya during the early evolution of flatworms, is the oldest known animal-chemoautotrophic bacteria association.

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) dramatically changed {{our perception of}} the diversity and evolutionary history of microbes involved in nitrification. In this study, a moderately thermophilic (46 °C) ammonia-oxidizing enrichment culture, which had been seeded with biomass from a hot spring, was screened for ammonia oxidizers. Although gene sequences for crenarchaeotal 16 S rRNA and two subunits of the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA and amoB) were detected via PCR, no hints for known ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were obtained. Comparative sequence analyses of these gene fragments demonstrated {{the presence of a}} single operational taxonomic unit and thus enabled the assignment of the amoA and amoB sequences to the respective 16 S rRNA phylotype, which belongs to the widely distributed group I. 1 b (soil group) of the Crenarchaeota. Catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD) –FISH combined with microautoradiography (MAR) demonstrated metabolic activity of this archaeon in the presence of ammonium. This finding was corroborated by the detection of amoA gene transcripts in the enrichment.

Here we investigated these sprout-like microbial aggregates by the rRNA approach and detailed microscopy. Based on fluorescence in situ hybridization and ultrastructural analysis, the sprout-like formations are morphologically highly organized, and their core consists of a member of a novel deep-branching lineage in the bacterial phylum Nitrospirae. This organism displays an interesting cellular ultrastructure with different kinds of cytoplasmic inclusions and is embedded in a thick extracellular matrix, which contributes to the stability and shape of the aggregates.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) of the phylum Thaumarchaeota {{and the high}} abundance of archaeal ammonia monooxygenase subunit A encoding gene sequences in many environments have extended our perception of nitrifying microbial communities. Moreover, AOA are the only aerobic ammonia oxidizers known to be active in geothermal environments. Molecular data indicate that in many globally distributed terrestrial high-temperature habits a thaumarchaeotal lineage within the Nitrosopumilus cluster (also called "marine" group I. 1 a) thrives, but these microbes have neither been isolated from these systems nor functionally characterized in situ yet. In this study, {{we report on the}} enrichment and genomic characterization of a representative of this lineage from a thermal spring in Kamchatka. This thaumarchaeote, <b>provisionally</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> "Candidatus Nitrosotenuis uzonensis", is a moderately thermophilic, non-halophilic, chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizer. The nearly complete genome sequence (assembled into a single scaffold) of this AOA confirmed the presence of the typical thaumarchaeotal pathways for ammonia oxidation and carbon fixation, and indicated its ability to produce coenzyme F 420 and to chemotactically react to its environment. Interestingly, like members of the genus Nitrosoarchaeum, "Candidatus N. uzonensis" also possesses a putative artubulin-encoding gene. Genome comparisons to related AOA with available genome sequences confirmed that the newly cultured AOA has an average nucleotide identity far below the species threshold and revealed a substantial degree of genomic plasticity with unique genomic regions in "Ca.

We have now generated a mAb to XCR 1, a chemokine receptor which is specifically expressed on CD 8 + DCs and a subpopulation of double negative DCs in the spleen. Using this antibody, we have determined that only XCR 1 +CD 8 + (around 80 % of CD 8 + DCs) and their probable precursors, XCR 1 +CD 8 − DCs, efficiently take up cellular material and excel in antigen cross-presentation. In lymph nodes (LNs) and peripheral tissues, XCR 1 + DCs largely, but not fully, correspond to CD 103 +CD 11 b− DCs. Most importantly, we demonstrate that XCR 1 + DCs in the spleen, LNs, and peripheral tissues are dependent on the growth factor Flt 3 ligand and are selectively absent in Batf 3 -deficient animals. These results provide evidence that expression of XCR 1 throughout the body defines the Batf 3 -dependent lineage of DCs with a special capacity to cross-present antigen.

The latest type objects are <b>provisionally</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> early L types. We plot our sources on Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams overlaid with theoretical pre-main-sequence isochrones. The majority of our objects lie close to or above the 1 -Myr isochrone, leading to an average cluster age that is < 1 Myr. We find 38 sources lie at or below the hydrogen-burning limit (0. 075 M ⊙). 10 sources potentially have masses below the deuterium-burning limit (0. 012 M⊙). We use a Monte Carlo approach to model the observed luminosity function {{with a variety of}} cluster age and mass distributions. The lowest χ 2 values are produced by an age distribution centred at 1 Myr, with a mass function that declines at substellar masses according to an Mα power law in the range α = 0. 3 - 0. 6.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the properties of soils in the fog belt area of the Oregon Coast Range. Soils in the study were chosen to include only those belonging to Andepts or to andic subgroups. Samples were collected from eleven sites that were formed mostly from colluvial deposits of basaltic rocks, sedimentary rocks, and alluvium derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The soils studied were characterized chemically and physically, and the mineralogy of the very fine sand and clay size fractions was determined. The eleven soils were classified on the assumption that Andisol is added in the Soil Taxonomy as the 11 th order. Based on the low degree of profile differentiation shown by profile morphology, it was concluded that all of the soils studied are in an early stage of development. The soil structure is mostly granular in the surface and fine subangular blocky in the subsoil. Field texture and laboratory analyses indicate low percentage clay compared to silt throughout the profiles. Surface layers are mostly dark colored. All the soils have low bulk density, high water holding capacity at high suction (15 bar), high CEC, high organic carbon, high pH in NaF, high variable charge, and high phosphorus retention -all of which indicate a high proportion of amorphous materials in the clay fraction. Based on the mineralogy of the very fine sand fraction and field site observations, it was concluded that basaltic and volcaniclastic rocks were the major sources of the parent materials that have weathered to produce a dominance of amorphous materials in the soils studied. Chloritic intergrade dominates the crystalline clay size components of all the soils with minor amounts of smectite, mica, gibbsite, chlorite, halloysite, and kaolinite.

40|$|When {{present during}} the whole infective cycle, the lysosomotropic drug, chloroquine, {{inhibited}} cytopathic changes and production of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in Vero cells. This inhibition decreased when the drug was added from 1 h to 4 h after infection. Chloroquine had no direct effect on the virus nor on viral adsorption and internalization. Electron microscopy showed that, {{in the presence of}} the drug, the virions were retained in large vacuoles having a lysosomal appearance. This inhibition was fully reversible, ven when the drug was removed as late as 72 h after infection. The results upport the hypothesis that ASFV enters the cells by adsorptive endocytosis and not by fusion with the plasma membrane. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is an enveloped DNA virus <b>provisionally</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> a member of the family Iridoviridae (Matthews, 1982) and whose pathway of penetration i to cells has not yet been established. Enveloped viruses may enter cells by fusion with the plasma membrane (e. g. Sendai virus; Poste & Pasternak, 1978). However, in the case of other groups of enveloped viruses, such as toga-, orthomyxo- and rhabdoviruses, the virions are first internalized by endocytosis and fusion occurs later with the m mbranes ofendocytic vacuoles (for reviews, see Dales, 1973; Helenius et al., 1980 b; Marsh, 1984). The fusion activity is triggered by an acidic environment (pH 5 to 6) and this process can be inhibited by lysosomotropic substances which raise the pH of endosomes and lysosomes (Marsh et al., 1983), such as weak bases like chloroquine, ammonium chloride and amantadine (Ohkuma & Poole, 1978). The use of these inhibitors is a convenient way to confirm that penetration ccurs intracellularly and not by fusion with the plasma membrane. The present work was undertaken to determine the effect of chloroquine on the infection f Vero cells by ASFV and to establish whether acidic endocytic vacuoles were involved in the infection...|$|R
40|$|We present {{near-infrared}} long slit and multi-slit {{spectra of}} low mass brown dwarf {{candidates in the}} Orion Nebula Cluster. The long slit data were observed in the H- & K-bands using NIRI on the Gemini North Telescope. The multi-object spectroscopic observations were made using IRIS 2 on the Anglo Australian Telescope at H-band. We develop a spectral typing scheme based on optically calibrated, near infrared spectra of young sources in the Taurus and IC 348 star forming regions with spectral types M 3. 0 to M 9. 5. We apply our spectral typing scheme to 52 sources, including previously published UKIRT and GNIRS spectra. 40 objects show strong water absorption with spectral types of M 3 to >M 9. 5. The latest type objects are <b>provisionally</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> early L types. We plot our sources on H-R diagrams overlaid with theoretical pre-main-sequence isochrones. The majority of our objects lie close to or above the 1 Myr isochrone, leading to an average cluster age that is < 1 Myr. We find 38 sources lie at or below the hydrogen burning limit (0. 075 Msun). 10 sources potentially have masses below the deuterium burning limit (0. 012 Msun). We use a Monte Carlo approach to model the observed luminosity function {{with a variety of}} cluster age and mass distributions. The lowest chi^ 2 values are produced by an age distribution centred at 1 Myr, with a mass function that declines at sub-stellar masses according to an M^alpha power law in the range alpha= 0. 3 to 0. 6. We find that truncating the mass function at 0. 012 Msun produces luminosity functions that are starved of the faintest magnitudes, even when using bimodal age populations that contain 10 Myr old sources. The results of these Monte Carlo simulations therefore support the existence of a planetary mass population in the ONC.

40|$|Background : Hepatitis G Virus (HGV) /GB Virus-C (GBV-C) is a newly {{discovered}} RNA virus. Nucleotide sequence comparison and phylogenetic {{studies of the}} 52 ̆ 7 untranslated region (52 ̆ 7 UTR) within the viral genome have identified at least three different types which have <b>provisionally</b> been <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> type 1 (West African origin), type 2 (North American origin) and type 3 (Asian origin). Methods and Results : The products of RT-PCR were sequenced by using blood donors and patients infected with HGV/GBV-C in Australia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands to investigate the genotype distribution {{in this area of}} the world. All the Australian isolates showed strong sequence homology with type 2, while the Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands sequences were more closely related, but differ from type 3, which has previously been reported from isolates studied within Asia. Conclusions : Phylogenetic analysis suggests that these latter sequences are either a new HGV/GBV-C Pacific type or a subtype of the Asian type RNA virus. Isolates homologous with type 1 were not identified in these population groups...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial DNA {{polymerase}} III (family C DNA polymerase), {{the principal}} chromosomal replicative enzyme, {{is known to}} occur {{in at least three}} distinct forms which have <b>provisionally</b> been <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> class I (Escherichia coli DNA pol C-type), class II (Bacillus subtilis DNA pol C-type) and class III (cyanobacteria DNA pol C-type). We have identified two family C DNA polymerase sequences in the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima. One DNA polymerase consisting of 842 amino acid residues and having a molecular weight of 97 213 belongs to class I. The other one, consisting of 1367 amino acid residues and having a molecular weight of 155 361, is a member of class II. Comparative sequence analyses suggest that the class II DNA polymerase is the principal DNA replicative enzyme of the microbe and that the class I DNA polymerase may be functionally inactive. A phylogenetic analysis using the class II enzyme indicates that T. maritima is closely related to the low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, in particular to Clostridium acetobutylicum, and mycoplasmas. These results are in conflict with 16 S rRNA-based phylogenies, which placed T. maritima as one of the deepest branches of the bacterial tree...|$|R
