The law also provides a mechanism for compulsory licensing and a collective rights management.|$|E

5000|$|The DGGB {{continues}} to be instrumental in working to improve directors’ terms, conditions and remuneration. In 1987, they established The Directors & <b>Producers</b> <b>Rights</b> Society (DPRS) and initiated the TV directors’ rights strike in 2000, creating an industry-wide alliance of the Guild, BECTU and the DPRS, which has brought about new residual block payment agreements with the main UK TV broadcasters and production companies and an industry-wide Directors Forum and has generated contract advice guides and a [...] "code of practice" [...] guideline for directors in television drama and non-fiction programming. Through specific motion picture, television, theatre, and radio groups, the Guild has produced model contracts, guides and provides advice across all live and recorded media. In 2008 the DPRS became the Directors UK, now the foremost industrial negotiating body for British recorded media directors.|$|E

50|$|Usually, a Broadway {{production}} option {{gives the}} <b>producer</b> first-class <b>rights.</b> This typically means a production in New York and possibly London. It can {{also include a}} first-class touring production. Other rights, such as rights to perform the work in other places around the world, {{are not included in}} first-class rights. It is also possible to get commercial use rights, which would give the <b>producer</b> <b>rights</b> to cast albums and merchandise that comes from the production. Subsidiary rights can also be negotiated. If a producer holds part of an author’s subsidiary rights, this would mean the producer would have a share in the profits from all amateur productions, television versions, or movie versions of this production. These rights typically only last for {{a certain period of time}} that is negotiated.|$|R

40|$|This Position Statement {{responds}} to the Communication of 10 January 2017 by which the European Commission launched a public consultation on the future legal framework for data-driven markets that emerge {{in the course of}} the current digitization of industrial production and the advent of smart products in which sensors are embedded. In particular, the Position Statement comments the Commission’s ideas on a possible future data <b>producer’s</b> <b>right</b> as a means of promoting access to data. While the Max Plank Institute agrees that there are indeed instances where there is a need to “unlock data”, it rejects a data <b>producer’s</b> <b>right.</b> Rather, the Institute recommends considering more targeted data access rights that would specifically react to situations in which a manufacturer of smart products would otherwise try to reserve related markets for itself. The Max Planck Institute thereby takes inspiration from the data portability right that has already been implemented as part of the Basic Data Protection Regulation. Moreover, general principles on the design of data access regimes are developed. In sum, the Max Planck Institute favours a sector-specific approach to the introduction of a general data access right or a generally applicable data access regime. Sector-specific rules are especially needed for answering more concrete questions such as regarding the person entitled to claim access or the one of whether a data holder should be remunerated for granting access to data...|$|R

5000|$|The {{notion of}} the ‘old moral economy’ is a fitting example of such conceptions. E. P. Thompson, in his work on 18th century England, {{described}} a society where [...] "notions of common well being, often supported by paternalistic traditional authorities, imposed some limits on the free operations of the market". Farmers were then not allowed to manipulate prices by withholding their products to wait for price increases. The actions of the middlemen were always considered legally suspect, were severely restricted and the poor were provided opportunities to buy staple foods in small parcels. Fair trade was already seen {{as a way to}} address market failures; although the concept mainly revolved around consumer, rather than <b>producer,</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R

40|$|From 10 January to 26 April 2017 the European Commission {{carried out}} a public {{consultation}} on Building a European Data Economy. The key legal question of the initiative is how access and use rights in industrial data, as a digital resource, should be defined and allocated {{in order to achieve}} the objectives of the EU data-driven economy. The present analysis focuses on the proposals for new rights in industrial data, and takes a methodological perspective of designing a regulatory intervention. The overall argument is that the ‘intervention logic’ behind the proposals for a data <b>producer’s</b> <b>right</b> does not appear straightforward, and that keeping the scenario of non-intervention by such rights might not be the least optimal option among the possible ‘ways forward’...|$|R

40|$|The German Federal Constitutional Court has {{delivered}} an important decision {{with regards to}} the permissibility of sampling which is widely used in hip hop and electronic music. With this decision, the Court ended a dispute that has been ongoing for almost 20 years. Furthermore, the Court has applied a fundamental rights discourse between the countervailing rights of the original authors and those of the new works using samples from the original works. The preceding courts found that sampling would constitute an infringement of the phonogram <b>producer</b> <b>rights</b> (Section 85 of the German Author’s Rights Act) where the samples could have been created independently. The German Constitutional Court, however, disagreed: By holding that sampling was a form of art protected by the fundamental right of artistic freedom and may outweigh the exploitation interest of the phonogram producer would only be impaired to a minimal extent by samplin...|$|R
