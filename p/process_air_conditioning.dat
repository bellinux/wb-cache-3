Although valuable, these steady-state tests do not accurately simulate the operation of mobile air conditioners. To allow transient testing of mobile <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems for use in model development and component selection, a heavily instrumented test facility was built. The test facility can accept any prototype or production mobile <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems.

40|$|AbstractSolar Air Heating Collectors {{have still}} a very small share of 0. 8 % of the nominal {{installed}} capacity in the solar heating and cooling market (151. 7 GWth) [1]. Although constituting a niche market, the potential of those kind of collectors to provide heat for industrial processes, processing food, room heating, <b>air</b> preheating, drying <b>processes</b> or <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> could be significant. However, the technical potentials of the various technological solutions {{are not easy to}} compare. Such a comparison would be important for different interest groups: end consumers (cost/kWh), technicians (efficiency, long time durability), planers and designers (amortization time) and politicians (CO 2 savings, national energy autonomy). In order to certify or rate technological variants it is necessary to have a standardized procedure for characterization based on scientific results. Important achievements were made in this respect within the last three years in Germany.

40|$|Sensor {{failure and}} bias are {{harmful to the}} <b>process</b> control of <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems, {{resulting}} in poor control of the indoor environment and waste of energy. A strategy is developed for the flow sensor fault detection and validation of variable air volume (VAV) terminals in <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems. Principal component analysis (PCA) models at both system and terminal levels are built and employed in the strategy. Sensor faults are detected using both the T 2 statistic and square prediction error (SPE) and isolated using the SPE contribution plot. As the reliability and sensitivity of fault isolation may be affected by multiple faults at the system level, a terminal level PCA model is designed to further examine the suspicious terminals. The faulty sensor is reconstructed after it is isolated by the strategy, and the FDD strategy repeats using the recovered measurements until no further fault can be detected. Thus, the sensitivity and robustness of the FDD strategy is enhanced significantly. The sensor fault detection and validation strategy, {{as well as the}} sensor reconstruction strategy for fault tolerant control, are evaluated by simulation and field tests.

The hybrid <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system contains two indirect evaporative coolers with internal baffle, one is utilized to pre-cool the air inlet to the desiccant wheel and the other is utilized to pre-cool the supply air inlet to the room. The effects of the inlet conditions of the <b>process</b> and reactivation <b>air</b> and working air ratio on the thermal performance of the hybrid <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system have been analyzed. The results of this study show that in the hybrid <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system for using the indirect evaporative cooler with internal baffle as a pre-cooling unit, the supply air temperature reduced by 21 % and the coefficient of performance improved by 71 % as compared to previous designs of the hybrid <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> system at the same inlet conditions. For increasing <b>process</b> <b>air</b> inlet temperature from 25  °C to 45  °C, supply air temperature increases from 12. 7  °C to 14. 2  °C, thermal COP increases from 1. 87 to 2. 84, and supply air relative humidity increases from 76. 7 % to 77. 4 %. Also, for increasing the reactivation air inlet temperature from 70  °C to 110  °C, supply air temperature dropped from 15. 9  °C to 10. 9  °C, supply air relative humidity dropped from 82. 7 % to 71. 8 %, and thermal COP dropped from 4. 5 to 1. 7.
