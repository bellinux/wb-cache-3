5|$|Since 1 January 2002, the {{national}} central banks (NCBs) and the ECB have issued euro banknotes on a joint basis. Euro banknotes do not show which central bank issued them. Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept euro banknotes <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>circulation</b> by other Eurosystem members and these banknotes are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of {{the total value of}} banknotes issued by the Eurosystem. In practice, the ECB's banknotes are <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>circulation</b> by the NCBs, thereby incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the ECB. The other 92% of euro banknotes are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares of the ECB capital key, calculated using national share of European Union (EU) population and national share of EU GDP, equally weighted.|$|E
