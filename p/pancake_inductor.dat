40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} a bi-objective optimization problem characterized by coupled field analysis. The optimal design of a <b>pancake</b> <b>inductor</b> for the controlled heating of a graphite disk is considered as the benchmark problem. The case study is related to the design of industrial applications of the induction heating of graphite disk. Design/methodology/approach - The expected goal of the optimization process is twofold: to improve temperature uniformity in the disk and also electrical efficiency of the inductor. The solution of the relevant bi-objective optimization problem is based on multiphysics field analysis. Specifically, the direct problem is solved as a magnetic and thermal coupled problem by means of finite elements; a mesh-inspired definition of thermal uniformity is proposed. In turn, the Pareto front trading off electrical efficiency and thermal uniformity is identified exploiting evolutionary computing. Findings - By varying the problem targets, different Pareto fronts are identified trading off thermal uniformity and electrical efficiency of the induction-heating device. Practical implications - These results suggest how to improve the design of this kind of device for the epitaxial growth of silicon wafer; the advantage of using a magnetic concentrator placed close to the inductor axis is pointed out. Originality/value - The coupling of a multiphysics direct problem with a multiobjective inverse problem is presented as a benchmark problem and accordingly solved. The benchmark provides a simple analysis problem that allows testing various optimization algorithms in a comparative way...|$|E
