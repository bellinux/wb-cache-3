5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of <b>parasitic</b> <b>worm</b> have been {{recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E
2500|$|In their Parasite Immunology {{article on}} worms and viral infections, Dr. Kamal et al. {{explain why some}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>worms</b> {{aggravate}} the immune response. [...] Because <b>parasitic</b> <b>worms</b> often induce Th2 cells and lead to suppressed Th1 cells, problems arise when Th1 cells are needed. [...] Such cases occur with viral diseases. [...] Several examples of viral infections worsened by <b>parasitic</b> <b>worms</b> are described below.|$|R
25|$|<b>Parasitic</b> <b>worms</b> {{have been}} used as a medical {{treatment}} for various diseases, particularly those involving an overactive immune response. As humans have evolved with <b>parasitic</b> <b>worms,</b> proponents argue they are needed for a healthy immune system. Scientists are looking for a connection between the prevention and control of <b>parasitic</b> <b>worms</b> and the increase in allergies such as hay-fever in developed countries. <b>Parasitic</b> <b>worms</b> may be able to damp down the immune system of their host, making it easier for them to live in the intestine without coming under attack. This may be one mechanism for their proposed medicinal effect.|$|R
2500|$|Worms {{may also}} be called helminths, {{particularly}} in medical terminology when referring to <b>parasitic</b> <b>worms,</b> especially the Nematoda (roundworms) and Cestoda (tapeworms). Hence [...] "helminthology" [...] {{is the study of}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>worms.</b> When a human or an animal, such as a dog or horse, is said to [...] "have worms", it means that it is infested with <b>parasitic</b> <b>worms,</b> typically roundworms or tapeworms. Deworming is a method to kill off the worms that have infected a human or animal by giving anthelmintic drugs.|$|R
5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} in this genus include the widespread fluke Prosthogonimus ovatus(which {{lives in the}} oviducts of birds), the <b>parasitic</b> <b>worm</b> Plagiorchis elegans, the larvae of parasitic flies, the feather mite Metanalges elongatus, and hard ticks of the genera Haemaphysalis and Ixodes. During the reintroduction of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season, enteritis and ill health in pre-release birds was due to bacteria of a pathogenic Campylobacter species. Subsequently, microbiology tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find {{the source of the}} bacteria in their environment.|$|E
5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the <b>parasitic</b> <b>worm</b> Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style {{is such that}} few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii {{has been found in}} polar bears, and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E

25|$|There is {{no clear}} {{consensus}} on the taxonomy of helminths; it {{is more of a}} commonly used term to describe certain worms with superficial similarities. These are flatworms (platyhelminthes), namely cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes), and roundworms or nemathelminths (nematodes) – both of these are <b>parasitic</b> <b>worm</b> types – and the annelida, which are not parasitic or at the most ectoparasites like the leeches.|$|E

25|$|Wild boars {{are known}} to host at least 20 {{different}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>worm</b> species, with maximum infections occurring in summer. Young animals are vulnerable to helminths like Metastrongylus, which are consumed by boars through earthworms, and cause death by parasitising the lungs. Wild boar also carry parasites known to infect humans, including Gastrodiscoides, Trichinella spiralis, Taenia solium, and Balantidium coli. Wild boar in southern regions are frequently infested with ticks (Dermacentor, Rhipicephalus, and Hyalomma) and hog lice. The species also suffers from blood-sucking flies, which it escapes by bathing frequently or hiding in dense shrubs.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of hemozoin in other blood-feeding organisms {{is not as}} well-studied as in Plasmodium. However, studies on Schistosoma mansoni have revealed that this <b>parasitic</b> <b>worm</b> produces large amounts of hemozoin during its growth in the human bloodstream. Although {{the shapes of the}} crystals are different from those produced by malaria parasites, chemical analysis of the pigment showed that it is made of hemozoin. In a similar manner, the crystals formed in the gut of the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus during digestion of the blood meal also have a unique shape, but are composed of hemozoin. Hz formation in R. prolixus midgut occurs at physiologically relevant physico-chemical conditions and lipids {{play an important role in}} heme biocrystallization. Autocatalytic heme crystallization to Hz is revealed to be an inefficient process and this conversion is further reduced as the Hz concentration increases.|$|E
25|$|Fasciolosis (also {{known as}} fascioliasis, fasciolasis, {{distomatosis}} and liver rot) is a <b>parasitic</b> <b>worm</b> infection {{caused by the}} common liver fluke Fasciola hepatica {{as well as by}} Fasciola gigantica. The disease is a plant-borne trematode zoonosis, and is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD). It affects humans, but its main host is ruminants such as cattle and sheep. The disease progresses through four distinct phases; an initial incubation phase of between a few days up to three months with little or no symptoms; an invasive or acute phase which may manifest with: fever, malaise, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, urticaria, anemia, jaundice, and respiratory symptoms. The disease later progresses to a latent phase with less symptoms and ultimately into a chronic or obstructive phase months to years later. In the chronic state the disease causes inflammation of the bile ducts, gall bladder and may cause gall stones as well as fibrosis. While chronic inflammation is connected to increased cancer rates, it is unclear whether fasciolosis is associated with increased cancer risk.|$|E

500|$|In {{classical}} Greece, Aristotle (384 – 322 BC) {{commented on}} the colour-changing abilities of the octopus, both for camouflage and for signalling, in his Historia animalium: [...] "The octopus... seeks its prey by so changing its colour as to render it like the colour of the stones adjacent to it; it does so also when alarmed." [...] Aristotle noted that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm and suggested it might be used in sexual reproduction. This claim was widely disbelieved until the 19th century. It was described in 1829 by the French zoologist Georges Cuvier, who supposed {{it to be a}} <b>parasitic</b> <b>worm,</b> naming it as a new species, Hectocotylus octopodis. Other zoologists thought it a spermatophore; the German zoologist Heinrich Müller believed it was [...] "designed" [...] to detach during copulation. In 1856 the Danish zoologist Japetus Steenstrup demonstrated that it is used to transfer sperm, and only rarely detaches.|$|E
