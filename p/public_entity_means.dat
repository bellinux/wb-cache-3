In some public institutions compliance with the regulatory framework has been limited to mere establishment of Supply Chain Management Units. Some of these units are not compliant with the National Treasury guidelines and are not properly staffed with personnel with the required skills and qualifications. Staff employed in Supply Chain Management units are either not provided with the required training {{in order to fulfill}} their employment obligations or do not see self-development in Supply Chain Management as of great importance. Supply Chain Management Policies do not evolve from within the institutions but more copies of the guidelines provided by the National Treasury. Staff do not get involved in policy development processes. This is a non-conclusive case study of the Eastern Cape Department of Roads of Public Works which is aimed at establishing the extent the department has complied with prescribed guidelines pertaining to establishment of Supply Chain Management, training of personnel and the development of policies and procedures on Supply Chain Management...|$|R

40|$|The {{degree to}} which a country’s <b>public</b> <b>entities</b> observe basic {{principles}} of good corporate governance is an increasingly important factor for attracting investment capital, maintaining economic stability and encouraging growth. Zimbabwe is faced with the challenge of restructuring for greater efficiency and creating an investment-friendly environment, therefore practicing good corporate governance in <b>public</b> <b>entities</b> is crucial for success and economic growth. As business <b>entities,</b> <b>public</b> <b>entities</b> need to be managed effectively by a competent board, which is able to construct and implement strategies that are {{in the best interests of}} the entity and all stakeholders. This study focuses on the corporate governance initiatives, laws and regulations aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of boards of <b>public</b> <b>entities</b> in Zimbabwe. The key question addressed is whether or not the corporate governance initiatives and legal and regulatory reforms in Zimbabwe are sufficient to enable boards of <b>public</b> <b>entities</b> to effectively discharge their duties and meet internationally accepted corporate governance standards. A comparative analysis of Zimbabwe’s <b>public</b> <b>entities</b> corporate governance framework to that of South Africa (a developing country like Zimbabwe) and Australia (a developed country with similar common law heritage) is also conducted. Recommendations are made on how best to enhance the effectiveness of boards of <b>public</b> <b>entities</b> in order to promote good corporate governance practices in Zimbabwean <b>public</b> <b>entities.</b> The research established that the existing corporate governance framework has not been effective in improving the effectiveness of Zimbabwe <b>public</b> <b>entity</b> boards due to lack of commitment and consistency, political interference, weak enforcement mechanisms, corruption and general disregard for the rule of law. The research found that South Africa and Australia have performed better than Zimbabwe in terms of creating conducive environments for boards of <b>public</b> <b>entities</b> to effectively discharge their duties. To improve the effectiveness of <b>public</b> <b>entity</b> boards, it was found that boards should be properly empowered, government intervention should be minimised, board appointment processes should be transparent and merit-based, boards should be properly composed, board remuneration should be fair and performance related, the performance of the board should be regularly evaluated and effective enforcement mechanisms should be put in place.

40|$|The South African {{government}} {{like most}} governments {{around the world}} create <b>public</b> <b>entities</b> to perform functions on its behalf and achieve particular objectives ranging from facilitating investments, delivering services or providing goods and advice. These <b>public</b> <b>entities</b> receive annual funding either {{whole or in part}} from the national fiscus and report to parliament through their respective Ministries. In the 2005 / 6 financial year government funded Umalusi 7, 69 million rands through direct transfer payments from the Department of Education, excluding any indirect payments from other governmental structures. Many <b>public</b> <b>entities,</b> about three hundred and thirty odd or so in South Africa, were promulgated to ensure and improve service delivery to the nation. However, they were not intended to be seen as an extension of their reporting departments. This research work evaluates the effectiveness of Umalusi in the education regulatory system and seeks to find ways to improve <b>public</b> <b>entity</b> effectiveness using the South African Excellence Model (SAEM) as the base tool to measure organisational effectiveness. A brief conclusion to this study is that Umalusi as a <b>public</b> <b>entity,</b> is adequately meeting its intended purpose. This is confirmed through its annual reports having never received a qualified audit since its inception. This research triangulates the results of the South African Excellence Model, the Questionnaire to senior education officials and the Auditors' Reports to confirm that Umalusi is effective as a <b>public</b> <b>entity</b> in the South African regulatory system.
