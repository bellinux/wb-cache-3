40|$|Important {{nursery grounds}} for <b>Patagonian</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Macruronus magellanicus) are located {{mainly in the}} Northwest Patagonian Inner Sea (42 ºS- 44 ºS), from which {{juvenile}} must to disperse or migrate offshore, then along the Chilean coast either northward or southward. The objective {{of this paper was}} to estimate northward spring juvenile migration of the <b>Patagonian</b> <b>grenadier</b> from nursery to feeding areas, which are located near Talcahuano (35 º 00 ’S- 37 º 10 ’S). Length-frequency data (LFD) were obtained from an acoustic survey carried out in November 1999, which covered from 35 ºS to 47 ºS. Generalized linear model was used to describe the presence of juvenile per latitude and depth, and to infer the origin and displacement of juveniles. Subsequently, LFD data were grouped according to latitudinal strata. Grouped LFD were decomposed into normal component groups, from which mean, standard deviation and proportion were estimated from the mixed LFD. The average length of the identified groups were sorted from south to north, and linked to compute significant increment in fish length and age per kilometers. The length increment per time was not due to growth, rather they was due to spatial displacement of juvenile from southern nursery grounds to northern feeding areas. Although homing to feeding areas and/or high residency (partial migration) have been postulated, it seems that recruitment of juveniles to northern feeding areas are origintaed from NPIS nurseries. The West Wind Drift Current seems to be the main drive for dispersion of <b>Patagonian</b> <b>grenadier</b> to recruit northward in open waters along the continental shelf...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The diet of jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) off southern-central Chile is {{described}} to examine potential biases in {{the determination of}} their main prey. Specimens were collected from catches using different fishing gear (jigging, trawl and purse-seine), from July 2003 to January 2004, and from December 2005 to October 2006. The stomach contents were analyzed in terms of frequency of occurrence, number, and weight of prey items and the diet composition was analyzed using Detrended Correspon-dence Analysis. In the industrial purse-seine fleet for jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi), the dominant prey of D. gigas was T. murphyi. In the industrial mid-trawl fishery for <b>Patagonian</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Macruronus magellanicus), the dominant species in the diet of D. gigas was M. magell-anicus. Similarly, Chilean hake (Merluccius gayi) was the main prey in the diet of D. gigas obtained in the industrial trawl fishery for Chilean hake; and, in both artisanal fish-eries (purse-seine for small pelagics and jigging), small pelagic fish and D. gigas were the main prey in the stomach contents of D. gigas. Cannibalism in D. gigas varied between different fleets and probably is related to stress behavior during fishing. The Detrended Correspondence Analysis ordination showed that the main prey in the diet of D. gigas {{is associated with the}} target species of the respective fishery. Consequently, biases are associated with fishing gear, leading to an overestimate in the occurrence of the target species in the diet. We recommend analyzing samples from jigging taken {{at the same time and}} place where the trawl and purse-seine fleets are operating to avoid this problem, and the application of new tools like stable isotope, heavy metal, and fatty acid signature analyses...|$|E
40|$|Peale s dolphin, Lagenorhynchus australis, is {{a common}} but little known species from {{southern}} South America. A {{review of the literature}} produced several observations ol feeding behaviour, but only four reports on the examination of stomach contents of this species, all lour weie hom the east coast of the continent in the southern South Atlantic. The seven animals sampled had fed on Aí gentine shiim p (Pleoticus muelleri), small octopus, three species of squid (Loligo gahi; Illex argentinus)., kingklip fish (Genypterus blacodes), Aí gentine hake (M erluccius hubbsi) and southern cod (Salilota australis). These species are common in the waters of the Patagonian shelf. W e report on further observations on dolphin feeding during regular shore-based studies along the central Strait of Magellan and on nine specimens lrom Tierra del Fuego, seven from the northeastern Atlantic coast and two young animals from the northeastern coast ol the Beagle Channel. All nine animals probably died incidentally in shore-based nets set for Patagonian blenny (Eleginops maclovinus). W e found al least 15 taxa represented in the stomach contents; eight species of fish, three of cephalopods, one bivalve m ollusc, two crustaceans and one species of salp. The salps had been taken by the youngest dolphins, which also had milk in their stom achs. U te most important prey species were bottom fish: hagfish (Myxine australis), southern cod (Salilota australis) and <b>Patagonian</b> <b>grenadier</b> (M acruronus magellanicus), followed by the red octopus (Enteroctopus megalocyathus) and Patagonian squid (L. gahi.). Hie rem aining species, among others Sprattus fuegensis and Illex argentinus, were marginal or perhaps items ingested by the other actual prey species. The feeding ecology of Peale’s dolphin off northeastern Tierra del Fuego seems to be associated with demersal and bottom species captured in or near kelp beds...|$|E

North American Association of Fisheries Economists (NAAFE), Corvallis, 2017. While rights-based management is generally purported enhance economic efficiency in fisheries and reduce over-capitalization, {{the social and}} economic outcomes due to this regulatory regime are less comprehensively understood. Relatively recently, industrialized and export-oriented Latin American fisheries began adopting individual transferable quota (ITQ) regimes to recover collapsed fish stocks. While these programs tend to follow standard, Western approaches to ITQ design and implementation, Argentina experimented with a new design model by interjecting social and ecological objectives into ITQ design through the creation of Artisanal and Social Quota reserves and through determining initial allocation based on historical vessel landings, employment, at-sea and on-land production, investment, historical landings across species, and record of fishery violations. In 2010, Argentina established ITQs for four commercially important and export-oriented fisheries: Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), <b>Patagonian</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Macruronus magellanicus), Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), and southern blue whiting (Micromesistius australis). The first part of this study, to be presented, is a comprehensive institutional analysis of the ITQ fishery management program in Argentina to preliminarily evaluate how configurations of rights-based managed influence social, economic, and ecological outcomes in regulated fisheries. This paper analyzes legislative documents and government data on program design, vessel landings, and participation in the ITQ program from 2000 - 2016, to evaluate how program design, specifically initial allocation and trading restrictions, potentially influences fishery outcomes. The results of this study are broadly applicable to understanding how the design of rights-based management regimes influence compliance behavior, social equity, and economic efficiency outcomes in developing country fisheries...|$|E
