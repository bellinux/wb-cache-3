50|$|By 1914 Perry & Co {{specialized}} in steel pens and <b>pen</b> <b>holders,</b> cycle chains, free wheels, hubs, bells and cycle accessories, stationers' sundries, gold pens, solitaires, studs, sleeve links, tobacconists' and drapers' sundries and had 2,000 employees.|$|E
50|$|The plotter fed a roll {{of paper}} with {{perforated}} edges over a drum with matching sprockets at the sides. The drum could move the paper forward and backward (the X-axis). A <b>pen</b> <b>holder</b> slid horizontally over the paper (the Y-axis). Both the drum and the <b>pen</b> <b>holder</b> were controlled by stepper motors. Commands included lowering the pen down to write and raising it up, and moving the drum or the <b>pen</b> <b>holder</b> one step of 1/100 in in either direction. There were also commands to move the drum and pen together one step in the four diagonal directions.|$|R

50|$|The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Gordon Brown, on {{his first}} visit to President Barack Obama in the White House in March 2009, gave the President a gift of a <b>pen</b> <b>holder</b> made from the wood of Gannet, {{reflecting}} her role in Victorian anti-slavery efforts. This gift was reciprocated with 25 DVDs of classic US feature films.|$|R
50|$|Earlier to {{this period}} the {{practice}} was to draw colourful paintings on wood on household furniture such as ceilings, bedsteads, doors and windows, palanquins and so forth. Internally this art form was called, kar-i-qulamdan as it was made as <b>pen</b> <b>holders</b> {{and a few other}} personal trinkets. Another term used for the art was kar-i-munaqqash as it was crafted on smoothly finished surfaces created using paper pulp or on layers of polished paper. Even treated and stretched skin was used for the purpose. Starting with decorating jackets of books, the art covered many items of that period such as tables, table ware, bangles, lamp stands, cups, plaques, panels, screens and cabinets.|$|E
50|$|The Eagle Pencil Company {{founded in}} the 1800s in Yonkers, New York on John Street. After 5 years, Daniel Berozlzheimer’s son Henry {{purchased}} the city’s first iron framed building for the new factory. The company produced pens, pencils, <b>pen</b> <b>holders</b> and erasers. In 1897, the London branch confirmed the policy of selling manufactured goods with high quality. Over the years, the company changed focus and goods. In 1952, Margros Ltd was founded by Mr. P.G.Hooley, who invented Powdered Colour and sold it directly to schools. Business grew such that the owners were unable to finance operations adequately, and the company was sold to Eagle Pencil Company in 1967.|$|E
50|$|The oblique dip pen was {{designed}} for writing the pointed pen styles of the mid 19th to the early 20th century such as Spencerian Script, although oblique <b>pen</b> <b>holders</b> {{can be used for}} earlier styles of pointed penmanship such as the copperplate scripts of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the name suggests, the nib holder holds the nib at an oblique angle of around 55° pointing to the right hand side of the penman. This feature helps greatly in achieving the steep angle required for writing certain scripts, but more importantly, it prevents the right hand nib tine from dragging on the paper as can be experienced when using a straight nib holder with a straight nib for this purpose.|$|E
40|$|Impaired hand motor {{function}} {{resulting from}} neurological, psychiatric or orthopaedic disorders affects patients of all ages. Existing hand function assessment methods, e. g. rating scales, accelerometers and electromyographical devices, are often time-consuming to administer, subjective in interpretation and/or expensive. Graphonomic tests are gaining popularity {{as a way}} of avoiding these drawbacks while relating directly to writing and drawing. Here we present a computerized Extended Drawing Test (EDT), which improves on an earlier Drawing Test for stroke patients in three ways. First, it assesses isolated proximal arm movement using a graphics pen in a puck-like <b>pen</b> <b>holder,</b> and in addition combined arm and finger dexterity in movements using a normal writing grip. Secondly, we calibrated our test against 186 healthy subjects (3 � 70 years), finding significant age- and handedness-related differences in both speed and accuracy of drawing. Thirdly, to simplify assessment we devised an overall performance measure using a variant of Fitts� Law combining speed and accuracy, which we found to be age-independent for healthy subjects above 3 years of age. This result enables us to provide age-independent performance norms using both hands, with and without the <b>pen</b> <b>holder.</b> These norms may assist quantification of specific arm dysfunction by comparing patient performance with the healthy norms, and also by comparing within-patient performance in the dominant and non-dominant hands with and without the <b>pen</b> <b>holder.</b> Using our freely available software, this new test will allow clinicians to rapidly assess arm and hand function across a wide range of patient categories and ages...|$|R

5000|$|During 1973 {{the wartime}} [...] "Hairy Mary" [...] working dress uniforms were {{replaced}} for all ranks with the 1972 pattern No 2 uniforms. Made of a smooth woollen and man-made fibre mix material the jacket was a loose blouson design with a front zip fastener and epaulettes.

50|$|Today, {{flight jackets}} are usually {{associated}} with the MA-1, a now-obsolete U.S. military jacket, which is mostly found in sage green. It is made with flight silk nylon and usually has a blaze orange lining, with the specification tag in the pocket, though earlier models had a sage-green lining and the specification tag on the neck area. It has two slanted flap pockets on the front, two inner pockets, and a zipped pocket with <b>pen</b> <b>holders</b> on the left sleeve. The lighter weight version of the MA-1 {{is known as the}} L-2B flight jacket, which in turn, replaced both the original L2 and L2A jackets, which all three differentiate from the MA-1 as they have snap-down epaulets and no inside pockets. The military flight jackets currently used today are the CWU-45P (for colder weather) and the CWU-36P (for warmer weather); both are made from Nomex.|$|E
50|$|Clipboards can be {{constructed}} {{from a variety of}} material, including but not limited to, aluminum, PVC, polypropylene, High Impact Polystyrene, Foamex and even wood. Clipboards generally come in two different designs—single or folding. Single clipboards are the more traditional type and consist of a single piece of rigid material and some sort of fixing mechanism along the top. Folding clipboards are usually constructed from a single piece of flexible PVC with two rigid materials enclosed within. A folding hinge connects the two sections to allow the front to be folded over the content to provide protection and often to allow some sort of promotional print or instructions. Folding clipboards also provide additional benefits because of the extra space available, allowing the incorporation of <b>pen</b> <b>holders</b> and pockets for storage. The arrival of the microprocessor and Internet age gave rise to high-tech variants of the traditional clipboard, the first being the Ferranti Market Research Terminal that retained a clip, to hold A4 paper sheets (looking like a large clipboard) but recording answers to questions in its electronic memory.|$|E
5000|$|When completed, {{it was the}} world's tallest marble-clad building, being {{sheathed}} {{entirely with}} 43,000 slabs of Italian Carrara marble. The marble used was thinner than previously attempted in cladding a building; this quickly {{proved to be a}} mistake. On December 25, 1973, during construction a 350-pound marble slab detached from the façade and penetrated the roof of the nearby Prudential Center. [...] In 1985, inspection found numerous cracks and bowing in the marble cladding of the building. To alleviate the problem, stainless steel straps were added to hold the marble in place. [...] Later, from 1990 to 1992, the entire building was refaced with Mount Airy white granite at an estimated cost of over $80 million. (Amoco was reluctant to divulge the actual amount, but it was well over half the original price of the building, without adjustment for inflation.) Two-thirds of the discarded marble was crushed and used as landscaping decoration at Amoco's refinery in Whiting, Indiana, one-sixth was donated to Governors State University, in University Park, Illinois, and one-sixth donated to Regalo, a division of Lashcon Inc. Under a grant from the Illinois Department of Rehabilitative Services, Regalo's 25 handicapped workers carved the discarded marble into a variety of specialty items such as corporate gifts and mementos including desk clocks and <b>pen</b> <b>holders.</b> The building's facade now somewhat resembles that of the former World Trade Center due to the upward flow of the columns.|$|E
50|$|Compasses {{are used}} for drawing circles or arc {{segments}} of circles. One form has two straight legs joined by a hinge; one leg has a sharp pivot point and the other has a holder for a technical pen or pencil. Another form, the beam compass, has the pivot point and <b>pen</b> <b>holder</b> joined by a trammel bar, useful when drawing very large radius arcs. Often a circle template is used instead of a compass when predefined circle sizes are required.|$|R

5000|$|In 1998, {{when the}} Delhi {{government}} launched the Bhagidari campaign, asking its citizens {{to participate in}} civic initiatives, the conservationist, Anita Ahuja and her IIT-alumna husband Shalabh rose to the challenge and launched Conserve. With a seed grant from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the duo began advocating waste management through seminars and workshops. Conserve started {{in the living room}} of some of Anita Ahuja's friends who were taking up issues like sewage and garbage. In synergy with the local Resident Welfare Associations (RWA), the Ahujas would also collect the waste of several colonies in a park and then segregate it. Wet kitchen waste would be converted into compost while dry refuse like polythene bags would be put aside. That project didn't quite work but led her to the idea of doing something about plastic bags. Over the next two years Ahuja experimented with recycling the bags. She tried weaving them together to create a tarpaulin-like covering for the shacks of slum dwellers. Another time she tried pasting pieces of the polyethylene onto canvas and cardboard. She saw that a thicker fabric could be used to make bric-a-brac like <b>pen</b> <b>holders</b> and file folders, and realized she'd finally found a successful recipe when her homemade products were popular at a fair at the U.S. embassy in New Delhi. She decided to venture into accessories. Ahuja’s project has created employment for scores of underprivileged people and also become a solution for solving the problem of plastic waste.The range has now been extended to creating footwear, cushions, jewellery, lamps, boxes and books.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited President Barack Obama {{and gave}} him the {{original}} framed commissioning papers for Resolute and an ornamental <b>pen</b> <b>holder</b> made from the timbers of HMS Gannet. HMS Gannet was not a sister ship to the Resolute, as has been widely reported. Her only connection with Resolute was that the Gannet was launched from the Chatham Dockyard, which was the same dockyard where Resolute was decommissioned. Gannet was launched in 1878 long after the cross Atlantic slave trade was made illegal, and also many years after the American Civil War. Therefore, she was not used in anti-slavery work in connection to these markets. She did, however, patrol the Mediterranean Sea and prevented slave trade there.|$|R

50|$|Doctors Thomas Maghee and John Eugene Osborne took {{possession}} of Parrott's body after his death, {{to study the}} outlaw's brain for clues to his criminality. The top of Parrott's skull was crudely sawn off, and the cap was presented to 15-year-old Lillian Heath, then a medical assistant to Maghee. Heath became the first female doctor in Wyoming and {{is said to have}} used the cap as an ash tray, a <b>pen</b> <b>holder</b> and a doorstop. A death mask was also created of Parrott's face, and skin from his thighs and chest was removed. The skin, including the dead man's nipples, was sent to a tannery in Denver, where it was made into a pair of shoes and a medical bag. They were kept by Osborne, who wore the shoes to his inaugural ball after being elected as the first Democratic Governor of the State of Wyoming. Parrott's dismembered body was stored in a whiskey barrel filled with a salt solution for about a year, while the experiments continued, until he was buried in the yard behind Maghee's office.|$|R

50|$|Negative priming is an {{implicit}} memory effect in which prior {{exposure to a}} stimulus unfavorably influences {{the response to the}} same stimulus. It falls under the category of priming, which refers to the change in the response towards a stimulus due to a subconscious memory effect. Negative priming describes the slow and error-prone reaction to a stimulus that is previously ignored. For example, a subject may be imagined trying to pick a red pen from a <b>pen</b> <b>holder.</b> The red <b>pen</b> becomes the target of attention, so the subject responds by moving their hand towards it. At this time, they mentally block out all other pens as distractors to aid in closing in on just the red pen. After repeatedly picking the red pen over the others, switching to the blue pen results in a momentary delay picking the pen out (however, there is a decline in the negative priming effect when {{there is more than one}} nontarget item that is selected against). The slow reaction due to the change of the distractor stimulus to target stimulus is called the negative priming effect.|$|R

Left: a radio, haptic feedback rabbit, maze, and presence-aware <b>pen</b> <b>holder.</b> Center: touch-sensitive toys. Right: custom neon signs. 3 D printers offer extraordinary flexibility for prototyping {{the shape and}} mechanical function of objects. We investigate how 3 D models can be modified to facilitate the creation of interactive objects offering dynamic input and output. We introduce a general technique to support rapidly prototyping interactivity by removing interior material from 3 D models to form internal pipes. We describe the design space of pipes for interaction design, where variables include openings, path constraints, topologies, and inserted media. We then present PipeDream, a tool for routing internal pipes through 3 D mod-els, integrated within a 3 D modeling program. We use two distinct routing algorithms. The first has users define pipes’ terminals and uses path routing and physics-based simulation to minimize pipe bending energy, allowing easy insertion of media post-print. The second lets users supply a desired in-ternal shape to which it fits a pipe route: for this we describe a graph-routing algorithm.
