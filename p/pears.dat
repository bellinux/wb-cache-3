5|$|In April 1939 Britten and <b>Pears</b> {{sailed to}} North America, going first to Canada {{and then to}} New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, {{including}} the difficult position of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success that Frank Bridge had enjoyed in the US; the departure of Auden and his friend Christopher Isherwood to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten's music in the English press; and under-rehearsed and inadequate performances. Britten and <b>Pears</b> consummated their relationship and from then until Britten's death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives. When the Second World War began, Britten and <b>Pears</b> turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and {{were told that they}} should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors. <b>Pears</b> was inclined to disregard the advice and go back to England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy's counsel and persuaded <b>Pears</b> to do the same.|$|E

5|$|In May 1943 Britten {{made his}} {{debut in the}} Decca studios, {{accompanying}} Sophie Wyss in five of his arrangements of French folk songs. The following January he and <b>Pears</b> recorded together, in Britten's arrangements of British folk songs, and the following day, in duet with Curzon he recorded his Introduction and Rondo alla burlesca and Mazurka elegiaca. In May 1944 he conducted the Boyd Neel string orchestra, Dennis Brain and <b>Pears</b> in the first recording of the Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings, which has frequently been reissued, most recently on CD.|$|E

5|$|The coyote {{feeds on}} a variety of {{different}} produce, including blackberries, blueberries, peaches, <b>pears,</b> apples, prickly <b>pears,</b> chapotes, persimmons, peanuts, watermelons, cantaloupes, and carrots. During the winter and early spring, the coyote eats large quantities of grass, such as green wheat blades. It sometimes eats unusual items such as cotton cake, soybean meal, domestic animal droppings, beans, and cultivated grain such as corn, wheat, and sorghum.|$|E
5|$|As for fruit trees, mangos {{and oranges}} {{are the most}} populous. Prickly <b>pears,</b> flamboyants, and {{colourful}} bougainvilleas brighten the scenery of hotels and camps on the island. Various organizations {{have contributed to the}} deforestation of the island.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. <b>Pears</b> said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told <b>Pears</b> that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E

5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and <b>pears.</b> Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E

5|$|In {{the section}} on sweets, David {{comments}} that throughout the Mediterranean countries, the more complicated sweets are very often bought from pâtisseries; the few recipes she gives are for simple, traditional sweets made at home, such as torrijas (also called pain perdu) and cold orange soufflé. The jams, chutneys and preserves section includes preserved melon alongside more familiar fruits such as <b>pears</b> and plums.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>PEAR</b> {{package is}} {{distributed}} as a gzipped tar file. Each archive consists of source code written in PHP, [...] Many <b>PEAR</b> packages can readily {{be used by}} developers as ordinary third party code via simple include statements in PHP. More elegantly, the <b>PEAR</b> package manager which comes with PHP by default {{may be used to}} install <b>PEAR</b> packages so that the extra functionality provided by the package appears as an integrated part of the PHP installation. Unlike the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) archives, , <b>PEAR</b> packages do not have implicit dependencies so that a package's placement in the <b>PEAR</b> package tree does not relate to code dependencies. Rather, <b>PEAR</b> packages must explicitly declare all dependencies on other <b>PEAR</b> packages.|$|R
40|$|Stemphylium vesicarium (teleomorph: Pleospora herbarum) is {{the causal}} agent of brown spot disease in <b>pear.</b> The species is {{also able to}} cause disease in asparagus, onion and other crops. Saprophytic growth of the fungus on plant debris is common. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate whether isolates of S. vesicarium from different hosts can be pathogenic to <b>pear.</b> More than hundred isolates of Stemphylium spp. were obtained from infected <b>pear</b> fruits, dead <b>pear</b> leaves, dead grass leaves present in <b>pear</b> orchard lawns as well as from necrotic leaf parts of asparagus and onion. Only isolates originating from <b>pear</b> orchards, including isolates from dead grass leaves, were pathogenic on <b>pear</b> leaves or fruits in bioassays. Non-pathogenic isolates were also present in <b>pear</b> orchards. Stemphylium vesicarium from asparagus or onion, with one exception, were not pathogenic to <b>pear.</b> Analysis of the genetic variation between isolates using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) showed significant concordance with host plants. Isolates from asparagus or onion belonged to clusters separate from the cluster with isolates from <b>pear</b> or grass leaves collected in <b>pear</b> orchards. Multilocus sequencing of a subset of isolates showed that such isolates were similar to S. vesicarium...|$|R

5|$|Wolves {{supplement}} their diet with {{fruit and vegetable}} matter. They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, blueberries and cowberry. Other fruits include nightshade, apples and <b>pears.</b> They readily visit melon fields during the summer months. A well-fed wolf stores fat under the skin, around the heart, intestines, kidneys, and bone marrow, particularly during the autumn and winter.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pear</b> suckers (Cacopsylla sp. or <b>pear</b> psylla) {{are widely}} {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} pest in <b>pear</b> orchards. Sustainable control of <b>pear</b> psylla relies on their natural suppression by beneficial arthropods and a well-tuned integration of crop protection treatments. Predatory bugs (Anthocoris sp.) are efficient predators of <b>pear</b> suckers, playing a crucial role in the control of <b>pear</b> psylla summer generations. However, their poor presence early and late in the season and their high mobility makes it difficult for growers to build up persistent predatory bug populations in their orchards to efficiently control <b>pear</b> psylla the whole season. Therefore, we investigated alternative natural enemies which potentially play an important role in the suppression of <b>pear</b> psylla, especially during early spring and autumn. To this end, a large-scale monitoring study was executed comprising extensive samplings throughout the year in fourteen <b>pear</b> orchards, and comparing psylla as well as beneficial fauna population developments between organic and IPM <b>pear</b> orchards. Organic orchards clearly displayed a lower <b>pear</b> psylla pressure correlating with higher proportions of specific predator populations, in particularly velvet mite (Trombidiidae) and spider (Araneae) populations. In addition, predation of C. pyri was verified by PCR-based gut content analysis. The outcome was analyzed in light of different treatment schedules, providing insights in potential side-effects of crop protection treatments on the composition of beneficial fauna in <b>pear</b> orchards...|$|R
5|$|As {{a pianist}} and {{conductor}} in other composers' music, Britten made many recordings for Decca. Among his studio collaborations with <b>Pears</b> are sets of Schubert's Winterreise and Die schöne Müllerin, Schumann's Dichterliebe, and songs by Haydn, Mozart, Bridge, Ireland, Holst, Tippett and Richard Rodney Bennett. Other soloists whom Britten accompanied on record were Ferrier, Rostropovich and Vishnevskaya. As a conductor he recorded {{a wide range}} of composers, from Purcell to Grainger. Among his best-known Decca recordings are Purcell's The Fairy-Queen, Bach's Brandenburg concertos, Cantata 151, Cantata 102 and St John Passion, Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius and Mozart's last two symphonies.|$|E
5|$|Awarded a {{scholarship}} to Oxford, Williams read Greats (pure Classics followed by Ancient History and philosophy) at Balliol. Among his influences at Oxford were WS Watt, R Meiggs, RM Hare, Elizabeth Anscombe, Eric Dodds, Eduard Fraenkel, David <b>Pears</b> and Gilbert Ryle. He shone {{in the first part}} of the course, the pure classics (being particularly fond of writing Latin verses in the style of Ovid) and graduated in 1951 with a congratulatory first in the second part of the course and a prize fellowship at All Souls.|$|E
5|$|Britten died of {{congestive}} heart failure on 4 December 1976. His funeral service was held at Aldeburgh Parish Church three days later, and he was buried in its churchyard, with a gravestone carved by Reynolds Stone. The authorities at Westminster Abbey had offered burial there, but Britten had {{made it clear that he}} wished his grave to be side by side with that, in due course, of <b>Pears.</b> A memorial service was held at the Abbey on 10 March 1977, at which the congregation was headed by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins of}} this variety are uncertain. [...] "Bon Chrétien" [...] (Good Christian) {{is named after}} Francis of Paola, a holy man whom King Louis XI of France had called to his deathbed as a healer in 1483. Francis offered the king a <b>pear</b> seed from his native Calabria with {{instructions}} to plant and care. Hence the <b>pear</b> tree was called [...] "Good Christian". The Williams <b>pear</b> is thought to date from 1765 to 1770 from the yard of an Aldermaston, England, schoolmaster named Mr. Stair or Mr. Wheeler, giving rise to the now-obscure synonyms 'Aldermaston' <b>pear</b> and 'Stairs' <b>pear.</b> A nurseryman named Williams later acquired the variety, and after introducing it {{to the rest of}} England, the <b>pear</b> became known as the Williams <b>Pear.</b> However, the <b>pear's</b> full name is Williams' Bon Chretien, or [...] "Williams' good Christian." ...|$|R
