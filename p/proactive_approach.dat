This integration enables IT service visualization to show upstream and downstream impacts. This aids in faster issue recognition and resolution.|$|E
25|$|Several factors {{should be}} {{considered}} in the development of intervention strategies. These include, but are not limited to: developmental level of the child, comorbid disabilities, environmental changes, motivating factors, and coaching strategies. It is also recommended that strategies should take a <b>proactive</b> <b>approach</b> in managing behaviour or skill deficits (when possible), rather than adopt a reactive approach. For example, an awareness of where a student may have difficulty throughout {{the course of the day}} can aid the teacher in planning to avoid these situations or in planning to accommodate the needs of the student.|$|E

25|$|Despite growing {{dissatisfaction with}} the privately owned dairy enterprises, the early {{factories}} of the dairy industry encouraged a <b>proactive</b> <b>approach</b> from farmers to improve the yield {{and quality of the}} region's milk products. The agricultural and dairy success of the area was directly linked to the community's ability to lobby for land to be set aside for the Boonah Showgrounds in order to hold an Agricultural show to showcase the district's produce and reinforce community spirit. The designer and manager of the creamery, Samuel Dover, was the first secretary of the newly formed Fassifern and Dugandan Pastoral and Agricultural Show Society. The first Boonah Show was held in 1898.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} Connecticut {{has taken a}} <b>proactive</b> <b>approach</b> to {{preserving}} railway right-of-ways. Since the 1970s, Connecticut Department of Transportation policy has been to acquire abandoned rail lines for preservation. This {{has contributed to the}} majority of railroad mileage in Connecticut to be publicly owned, between the state and Amtrak. Today, this policy continues; the State will purchase any RoW that shows future potential for transportation, when the property becomes available. CDOT has subsequently transferred 60 miles of RoW to the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for use in rail trails, and CDEEP itself has independently obtained another 50 miles (22 of which are used for the Valley Railroad). A provision of this transfer is that CDOT is allowed to retake ownership of a right-of-way when needed for transportation purposes. Because of this, Connecticut is one of the only states where railbanked corridors have a reasonable chance of reactivation (should there be a need to), where elsewhere local opposition from trail users and property abutters would be able to directly influence a municipally-owned right-of-way.|$|E
40|$|Major {{conservation}} efforts in human-dominated systems, such as farmland, {{have focused on}} the establishment of subsidies and compensation promoting low-impact management practices to reverse the impacts of conservation threats in the short term (reactive approaches). In this study, we discuss how a different way of framing conservation policy (<b>proactive</b> <b>approaches)</b> could lead to fundamentally different long-term conservation outcomes. We define <b>proactive</b> <b>approaches</b> as those not necessarily including measures directly addressing the threats affecting biodiversity, but promoting transitions from current scenarios in which species are threatened to new states in which the threat is no longer present. We illustrate reactive and <b>proactive</b> <b>approaches</b> using as a case study two contrasting conservation frameworks for a vulnerable farmland bird, the Montagu's harrier (Circus pygargus) in northeastern Spain. This example shows that reactive approaches can lead to ¿conservation traps,¿ which we defined as situations where the application of biologically focused actions in response to conservation problems results in an unsustainable need to perpetuate the implementation of those actions. Our aim is to offer a fresh perspective on biodiversity conservation in human-dominated systems and to stimulate alternative, more holistic approaches in conservation promoting transitions to new states not requiring long-term active and costly conservation action.

500|$|Four {{engineers}} responded: Edward Serrell, Samuel Keefer, Charles Ellet, Jr., and John Augustus Roebling. [...] All submitted {{designs for}} a suspension bridge. [...] At {{the time of}} the bidding, Ellet and Roebling were acknowledged as masters of suspension bridge building in America. [...] Roebling submitted two designs, a conservative single-deck suspension bridge and a double-decked version, both with meticulous calculations and drawings. [...] Instead of relying solely on submissions, Charles Ellet, Jr. took a <b>proactive</b> <b>approach.</b> [...] When he got wind of the project in 1845, he wrote to Charles B. Stuart, chief engineer of the Great Western Railway, boldly proclaiming that he could build a bridge for any likely purpose across the Niagara. [...] After the charters had been obtained, Ellet helped Stuart to sell the bridge companies' stock and offered to buy US$30,000 worth of stock himself. [...] His efforts earned him the $190,000 bridge contract on November 9, 1847.|$|E

40|$|During {{the first}} months, the 2014 {{outbreak}} of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa was characterised by inadequate intervention capacities. In this paper, we investigate (1) the influence of limited but dynamic intervention capacities and their effect on the effective reproduction number, and (2) the effects of proactive versus reactive intervention approaches. We use a transmission model extended with dynamical intervention capacities. Taking into account a bandwidth for potential over- and under-reporting in reported Ebola virus disease cases, the model is used to generate ensembles of plausible scenarios. Next, it is used for testing the effectiveness of more <b>proactive</b> <b>approaches</b> in extending intervention capacities across these scenarios. We show that reactive approaches in extending intervention capacities can lead to continued under-capacity, and, consequently, to an increase of the effective reproduction number and to accelerated EBOV transmission. <b>Proactive</b> <b>approaches,</b> which take deployment delays, doubling times of diseases, and potential under-reporting {{of the number of}} cases into account, help in limiting the total number of cases and deaths if the effective reproduction number in isolation is lower than the effective reproduction number outside of isolation. If the effective reproduction number in isolation is higher, proactive intervention policies still outperform reactive intervention policies. Policy Analysi...|$|R
