30|$|Typically, {{hydrocarbon}} production networks have several fluid routing alternatives that are applied by {{opening and closing}} on–off valves. This usually sends the wells’ fluids through a specific <b>pipeline,</b> <b>pump</b> or compressor, or to a particular separator, among other requirements. This paper presents a general methodology to compute all fluid routing configurations of a production network using a graph representation of it. The particular implementation case discussed in this paper involves interacting with a preexisting steady-state computational model of the production network. The method starts by extracting from the model the name list of elements in the network and their type. Equipment (wells, separators, junctions, pumps, compressors, valves, etc.) is tagged as nodes and pipes (flowlines, connectors) are tagged as edges. The nodes are further classified by type: sources (wells), internals (e.g., junctions) or sinks (separators). The start and end element of each edge is recorded. This process yields a network connectivity list. A depth-first search is executed from each source to each sink. The search keeps track of the edges that must be active in each path and honors (if any) pre-specified edge directions. All paths for one source node in one component are combined to form all feasible edge combinations for that source node, and these combinations are again combined for all the source nodes in each component. This is repeated for all graph components. The unique combinations are stored and reported at the end. The method has been tried in a production network with seven wells representing a typical subsea production system in the North Sea where the wells {{have the option to}} produce (through two flowlines) to two separators on the platform. The production network model was available in a commercial software; thus, there was no access to the code or the underlying equations. The model was controlled from an external computational routine using automation. The graph was extracted from the model, all operating configurations of the network were computed (2187), and then each one was applied (by enabling or disabling flowlines) and evaluated in the commercial software. This allowed to identify routing configurations that provided maximum total oil production or maximum total gas production. There were only 306 configurations that yielded a total oil production close (within 10 %) to the maximum recorded oil production. The input data of the production system model are given in the appendix for verification and benchmarking by a third party. Details about the implementation are provided.|$|E
40|$|Technical BriefTechnical Brief 2 : Mechanical seals {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of {{industrial}} applications, sealing gases in a compressor or sealing liquids in a pump. Reliability, longevity, emission control and safety are now more important than ever. This purpose sounds simple, but designing mechanical seal components and selecting the most appropriate materials is a real challenge, especially when sealing fluids under harsh operating conditions. This paper describes two applications using a unique sealing solution, an engineered seal design and a specific sliding face diamond material. In the first case, the end-user in Venezuela is using Multiphase Pumping Technology to transfer a mixture of crude oil and gas in a single pipeline without separation. The installed seals have to handle a mixture of crude oil, formation water, solids and natural gas. Previously, no mechanical seals were available for such conditions and consequently engineered seals have been developed for this purpose. The pumped fluid does not provide the required stable liquid lubrication film for their mechanical seal faces. Another challenge is the presence of abrasive particles. So the selection of the seal face materials is important. Extremely robust face materials are required to avoid unacceptable deformations and to minimize abrasive wear which may result in a mechanical seal failure. Multiple seal arrangements available today can handle multiphase fluids, using hard/hard face materials in combination with a complex auxiliary/flush system, but have only limited capabilities with regard to poor lubrication and necessary cooling, when handling crude oil with high viscosity and natural gas. In this specific application described in this paper, a sophisticated Single Mechanical Seal has been used successfully over many years. However, due to changing oil well conditions, the lifetime of their mechanical seals was reduced dramatically. To solve this problem, a slurry seal design in combination with the diamond seal face material, well-known for its ultimate hardness, was installed. Seal faces with diamond surfaces offer outstanding abrasive resistance due to their unique hardness similar to natural stone and, at the same time provide considerably improved dry running performance due to their low friction coefficient. In the second case, the end-user in Brazil is using High Pressure Pipeline Pumps for the transportation of the heavy crude oil. In case of high pressures, high speed and abrasive particles, which is typical in crude oil applications, their mechanical seals need special attention. Extremely hard and strong face materials are required to avoid unacceptable deformations and to minimise abrasive wear which may result in high leakage. State of the art hard/hard face material combinations cannot handle crude oil with high viscosity and have limited capabilities with regard to poor lubrication associated with the necessary cooling. In both applications, in a multiphase twin screw pump and in a centrifugal <b>pipeline</b> <b>pump,</b> engineered mechanical seals with diamond seal face material solved the problem and are used successfully since the start-up of the pumps. This new sealing technology offers significant benefits to the end-user...|$|E
