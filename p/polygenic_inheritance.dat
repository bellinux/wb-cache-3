25|$|In {{classical}} genetics, if genes A and B are mutated, {{and each}} mutation by itself produces a unique phenotype {{but the two}} mutations together show the same phenotype as the gene A mutation, then gene A is epistatic and gene B is hypostatic. For example, the gene for total baldness is epistatic to the gene for brown hair. In this sense, epistasis can be contrasted with genetic dominance, which is an interaction between alleles at the same gene locus. As the study of genetics developed, and {{with the advent of}} molecular biology, epistasis started to be studied in relation to Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) and <b>polygenic</b> <b>inheritance.</b>|$|E

40|$|There is a {{large group}} of {{disorders}} characterized by non-cranial vascular malformations and a dysregulated growth, of which the prototype may be Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS). The aetiology of KTS and vascular malformations-dysregulated growth (VM-DG) syndromes resembling KTS is obscure, but <b>polygenic</b> paradominant <b>inheritance</b> involving mutations or polymorphisms in two or more genes simultaneously, of which one (or more) are involved in (lymph) angiogenesis and the other(s) in growth regulation has been proposed for KTS and related VM-DG entities. This provides an explanation for the variability of the VM-DG syndromes through the numerous possible combinations of mutated genes involved. We report on three monozygotic female twins who are discordant for a VM-DG syndrome resembling KTS. We suggest that our observation is consistent with the concept of <b>polygenic</b> paradominant <b>inheritance</b> involving two or more genes. We discuss the published observations in twins discordant for other disorders associated with disturbed growth regulation such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Silver-Russell syndrome, and the occurrence in cousins with KTS and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which are best explained by an imprinting disturbance. We propose that, similarly, disturbed imprinting plays a role in the pathogenesis of VM-DG syndromes in general, and suggest the same may hold for KTS in sensu strictu or Proteus syndrome. Further studies to investigate imprinting status in VM-DG syndromes, including KTS and Proteus syndrome, are warranted. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserve...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formula to predict expected response to one generation of truncation selection for a dichotomous trait under <b>polygenic</b> additive <b>inheritance.</b> The derivation {{relies on the}} threshold liability concept and on the normality assumption of the joint distribution of additive genetic values and their predictors used as selection criteria. This formula accounts for asymmetry of response when both the prevalence of the trait and the selection rate differ from 1 / 2 via a bivariate normal integral term. The relationship with the classical formula R = ipσ(G) is explained with a Taylor expansion about a zero value of the correlation factor. Properties are illustrated with an example of sire selection based on progeny test performance which shows a departure from usual predictions up to 15 - 20 % at low (0. 05) or high (0. 95) selection rates.

50|$|Thus, due to {{the nature}} of {{polygenic}} traits, inheritance will not follow the same pattern as a simple monohybrid or dihybrid cross. <b>Polygenic</b> <b>inheritance</b> can be explained as Mendelian inheritance at many loci, resulting in a trait which is normally-distributed. If n is the number of involved loci, then the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b)2n will give the frequency of distribution of all n allele combinations. For a sufficiently high values of n, this binomial distribution will begin to resemble a normal distribution. From this viewpoint, a disease state will become apparent at one of the tails of the distribution, past some threshold value. Disease states of increasing severity will be expected the further one goes past the threshold and away from the mean.|$|E

The Punnett square is a tabular summary of possible combinations of maternal alleles with paternal alleles. These tables can be used to examine the genotypic outcome probabilities of the offspring of a single trait (allele), or when crossing multiple traits from the parents.

It is important to understand the terms [...] "heterozygous", [...] "homozygous", [...] "double heterozygote" [...] (or homozygote), [...] "dominant allele" [...] and [...] "recessive allele" [...] when using the Punnett square method.

The overwhelming majority of these disorders are due to an isolated developmental defect, but on occasion the condition is genetically inherited [5, 6].

40|$|The {{classical}} <b>polygenic</b> {{theory of}} <b>inheritance</b> postulates {{a large number}} of genes with small, and essentially similar, effects. We propose instead a model with genes of gradually decreasing effects. The resulting phenotypic distribution is not normal; if the gene effects are geometrically decreasing, it can be triangular. The joint distribution of parent and offspring genic value is calculated. The most readily testable difference between the two models is that, in the decreasing-effect model, the variance of the offspring distribution from given parents depends on the parents' genic values. The more the parents deviate from the mean, the smaller the variance of the offspring should be. In the equal-effect model the offspring variance is independent of the parents' genic values...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Non-stationary {{function}} optimization {{has proved}} a difficult area for Genetic Algorithms.

This paper describes a haploid GA that appears to have this property, through the use of <b>Polygenic</b> <b>Inheritance.</b> <b>Polygenic</b> <b>inheritance</b> differs from most implementations of GAs in that several genes contribute to each phenotypic trait. Two non-stationary function optimization problems from the literature are described, and a number of comparisons performed.

The second effect, the intraperitoneal extravascular leukocyte response to small doses of endotoxin, also was found to follow characteristic patterns of <b>polygenic</b> <b>inheritance.</b> As estimated from an analysis of the variance of mice of the F 1 and F 2 generations, the degree of genetic determination is approximately 54 % for the neutrophil response and 82 % for the monuclear response...|$|E
40|$|The finite {{polygenic}} model approximates <b>polygenic</b> <b>inheritance</b> by postulating that {{a quantitative}} trait {{is determined by}} n independent, additive loci. The 3 (n) possible genotypes for each person in this model limit its applicability. CANNINGS, THOMPSON, and SKOLNICK suggested a simplified, nongenetic version of the model involving only 2 n + 1 genotypes per person. This article shows that this hypergeometric polygenic model also approximates <b>polygenic</b> <b>inheritance</b> well. In particular, for noninbred pedigrees, trait means, variances, covariances, and marginal distributions match those of the ordinary finite polygenic model. Furthermore as n -> &, the trait values within a pedigree collectively tend toward multivariate normality. The implications of these results for likelihood evaluation under the polygenic threshold and mixed models of inheritance are discussed.

40|$|The {{influence}} of genetic {{factors in the}} development of schizophrenia has been convincingly demonstrated by family, twin, and adoption studies. The statistical construct of heritability is generally used for estimating the liability due to genetic factors. Heritability estimates for schizophrenia are reported to be between 60 and 80 %. Due to the technical achievements in whole genome-wide association studies, dissection of the underlying genetic factors was intensified recently, resulting in the conclusion that schizophrenia is essentially a polygenic, complex disorder. Most likely more than 100 genes, each with small effect size, contribute to disease risk. A most recent multi-stage genome-wide association study (Ripke et al. in Nat Genet 2013) identified 22 risk loci and estimated that 8, 300 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms contributed to the risk accounting collectively for 32 % in liability. In addition to this <b>polygenic,</b> complex <b>inheritance,</b> there is also strong indication that in some patients a deletion or insertion of a larger chromosomal region [so-called copy number variation (CNV) ] might {{play a crucial role in}} pathogenesis. This could be specifically important in sporadic cases with schizophrenia, since a higher frequency of de novo mutations has been associated with these CNVs.
