5|$|New villages appeared, {{consisting}} of timber houses built {{side by side}} in equal parcels of land. For instance, the scarcely inhabited forests of the Western Carpathians (in present-day Slovakia) developed a network of settlements under Béla IV. Huts disappeared, and new rural houses {{consisting of}} a living room, a kitchen and a pantry were built. The most advanced agricultural techniques, including asymmetric heavy <b>ploughs,</b> also spread throughout the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|On a {{domestic}} scale, the spade, fork, and hoe are {{the tools of}} choice while on commercial farms a range of mechanical equipment is available. Besides tractors, these include <b>ploughs,</b> harrows, drills, transplanters, cultivators, irrigation equipment, and harvesters. New techniques are changing the cultivation procedures involved in growing vegetables with computer monitoring systems, GPS locators, and self-steer programs for driverless machines giving economic benefits.|$|E
5|$|Early {{improvement}} {{was carried out}} with the traditional tools, but new technology was increasingly important. Lighter <b>ploughs</b> were adopted, including from 1763 James Small's cast iron and curved mould board. It was first adopted in the south-east and spread to {{rest of the country}} in the 1770s. From 1788 Andrew Meikle's automated threshing mill speeded up {{a vital part of the}} harvesting process. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ploughing</b> {{includes}} tilling of soil, intercultural <b>ploughing</b> {{and summer}} <b>ploughing.</b> <b>Ploughing</b> uproots weeds, {{causing them to}} die. In summer <b>ploughing</b> is done during deep summers. Summer <b>ploughing</b> also helps in killing pests.|$|R
40|$|A {{long-term}} {{experiment was}} established to examine the crop yield and the weed infestation, focussed on Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), as effect of different intensity of primary tillage (mouldboard <b>plough</b> deep or shallow, double-layer <b>plough,</b> chisel <b>plough)</b> in combination with or without stubble tillage. The most effective ways to keep the infestation of C. arvense at a low level were deep mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> {{and the use of}} a double-layer <b>plough.</b> After the experiment had run seven years, the thistle biomass was < 2 g DM m- 2 in these treatments, compared to 23 – 26 g DM m- 2 in the treatments with chisel <b>ploughing</b> or shallow <b>ploughing.</b> In all treatments, stubble tillage in addition to primary tillage significantly reduced the thistle biomass by 30 – 80 %. A high density of lucerne/grass re-growth occurred in the chisel <b>plough</b> treatment. The soil seed bank of thistles ranged between 220 (deep <b>plough)</b> and 6, 400 seeds m- 2 (chisel <b>plough)</b> in the sixth year of the experiment. Stubble tillage is essential if the chisel <b>plough</b> or shallow <b>ploughing</b> is used for conservation tillage in organic farming. The double-layer <b>plough</b> can control C. arvense comparable to deep <b>ploughing...</b>|$|R
40|$|In two {{long-term}} experiments (started in 1978) on day loam soils {{each with}} four randomized blocks, four different <b>ploughing</b> depths had been compared during a fifteen year period on sites previously <b>ploughed</b> {{to a depth}} of ab out 25 cm. During the whole experimental period, fertilizing, crop residue management and other treatments had been equal for all <b>ploughing</b> depths. Deep <b>ploughing</b> had resulted in a few percent higher accumulated yields than shallow <b>ploughing,</b> probably because of higher weed infestation (Elymus repens, (L.) Gould) for shallow <b>ploughing.</b> In two treatments (mouldboard <b>ploughing</b> to about 31 cm and 16 cm) an investigation was made in 1993 on bulk soil properties and penetration resistance and on concentration and total amount of organic matter and nitrogen. Depending on the <b>ploughing</b> depth used, sampling was done in two layers for deep <b>ploughing</b> and three layers for shallow <b>ploughing.</b> The first layer from the ground surface to present <b>ploughing</b> depth and the second layer (shallow <b>ploughing)</b> from present to previous <b>ploughing</b> depth. The bottom layer is a shallow transition layer between topsoil and subsoil. Bulk density and degree of compactness were higher and porosity lower in deeper layers. There was a <b>plough</b> pan in both treatments but at different depths.

During the Lim era, Mari was divided into four provinces in addition to the capital, the provincial seats were located at Terqa, Saggaratum, Qattunan and Tuttul.

5|$|Ploughshare, triangular-shaped: Triangular-shaped stone ploughshares {{are found}} at the sites of Majiabang culture dated to 3500 BC around Lake Tai. Ploughshares have also been {{discovered}} at the nearby Liangzhu and Maqiao sites roughly dated to the same period. David R. Harris says this indicates that more intensive cultivation in fixed, probably bunded, fields had developed by this time. According to Mu Yongkang and Song Zhaolin's classification and methods of use, the triangular plough assumed many kinds and were the departure from the Hemudu and Luojiajiao spade, with the Songze small plough in mid-process.

By heating together tin and copper, which were in abundance in the area, the Beaker culture people made bronze, and later iron from iron ores. The development of iron smelting allowed the construction of better <b>ploughs,</b> advancing agriculture (for instance, with Celtic fields), {{as well as the}} production of more effective weapons.|$|E

Large numbers were raised in Wales and herded on foot to be fattened in England for selling in English markets. On Welsh farms they were used to pull <b>ploughs</b> and sometimes wagons during the nineteenth century, and were the prized possessions by which a man's wealth could be estimated.

5|$|At Christmas 1085, William {{ordered the}} {{compilation}} {{of a survey}} of the landholdings held by himself and by his vassals throughout the kingdom, organised by counties. It resulted in a work now known as the Domesday Book. The listing for each county gives the holdings of each landholder, grouped by owners. The listings describe the holding, who owned the land before the Conquest, its value, what the tax assessment was, and usually the number of peasants, <b>ploughs,</b> and any other resources the holding had. Towns were listed separately. All the English counties south of the River Tees and River Ribble are included, and the whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086, when the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that William received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the Salisbury Oath, a renewal of their oaths of allegiance. William's exact motivation in ordering the survey is unclear, but it probably had several purposes, such as making a record of feudal obligations and justifying increased taxation.|$|E
5|$|Atherton, {{along with}} {{neighbouring}} Shakerley, {{was associated with}} coal mining and nail manufacture. Alexander Naylor was taxed on his goods in 1332, showing the industry was present for at least 600years. Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal, iron was brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Spain. A variety of nails were made, lath nails, slate nails, thatching nails and sparrowbills. The nail smithies manufactured <b>ploughs</b> and scythes; their products were taken by pack horse to be sold in Manchester, Denbigh, Clitheroe and Kendal. The nail industry developed into the manufacture of nuts and bolts. Thomas Blakemore {{was the first in}} 1843 and by 1853 there were eight makers of nuts and bolts including James Prestwich and Robert Parker. Some manufacturers of nuts and bolts made spindles and flyers for spinning machinery. Collier Brook Bolt Works on Bag Lane dating from 1856 survives and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E

5|$|In the {{smelting}} {{process of}} using huge bellows driven by waterwheels, {{massive amounts of}} charcoal {{were used in the}} production process, leading {{to a wide range of}} deforestation in northern China. However, by the end of the 11th century the Chinese discovered that using bituminous coke could replace the role of charcoal, hence many acres of forested land in northern China were spared from the steel and iron industry with this switch of resources. Iron and steel of this period were used to mass-produce <b>ploughs,</b> hammers, needles, pins, nails for ships, musical cymbals, chains for suspension bridges, Buddhist statues, and other routine items for an indigenous mass market. Iron was also a necessary manufacturing component for the production processes of salt and copper. Many newly constructed canals linked the major iron and steel production centers to the capital city's main market. This was also extended to trade with the outside world, which greatly expanded with the high level of Chinese maritime activity abroad during the Southern Song period.|$|E
25|$|Early steel <b>ploughs,</b> {{like those}} for {{thousands}} of years prior, were walking <b>ploughs,</b> directed by the ploughman holding onto handles {{on either side of the}} plough. The steel <b>ploughs</b> were so much easier to draw through the soil that the constant adjustments of the blade to react to roots or clods was no longer necessary, as the plough could easily cut through them. Consequently, it was not long after that the first riding <b>ploughs</b> appeared. On these, wheels kept the plough at an adjustable level above the ground, while the ploughman sat on a seat; whereas, with earlier <b>ploughs</b> the ploughman would have had to walk. Direction was now controlled mostly through the draught team, with levers allowing fine adjustments. This led very quickly to riding <b>ploughs</b> with multiple mouldboards, dramatically increasing ploughing performance.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. If basal-water {{discharge}} {{and pressure}} are sufficiently high, a soft-bedded glacier will slip over its bed by <b>ploughing,</b> {{the process in}} which particles that span the ice–bed interface are dragged across the bed surface. Results of laboratory experiments indicate that resistance to <b>ploughing</b> can decrease with increasing <b>ploughing</b> velocity (velocity weakening). During <b>ploughing</b> at various velocities (15 – 400 ma– 1), till was compacted in front of idealized particles, causing pore pressures there that were orders of magnitude higher than the ambient value. This excess pore pressure locally weakened the till in shear, thereby decreasing <b>ploughing</b> resistance {{by a factor of}} 3. 0 – 6. 6 with a six-fold increase in <b>ploughing</b> velocity. Characteristic timescales of pore-pressure diffusion and compaction down-glacier from <b>ploughing</b> particles depend on till diffusivity, <b>ploughing</b> velocity and sizes of <b>ploughing</b> particles. These timescales accurately predict the ranges of these variables over which excess pore pressure and velocity weakening occurred. Existing <b>ploughing</b> models do not account for velocity weakening. A new <b>ploughing</b> model with no adjustable parameters predicts <b>ploughing</b> resistance to no worse than 38 % but requires that excess pore pressures be measured. Velocity weakening by this mechanism may affect fast glacier flow, sediment transport by bed deformation and basal seismicity. 1...|$|R

Three soil treatments, normal <b>ploughing,</b> light <b>ploughing</b> and no <b>ploughing,</b> were applied in four kinds of crop. Carabid beetles were sampled weekly using pitfall traps. Soil <b>ploughing</b> increases the abundance of the dominant species, Pterostichus melanarius. Species richness significantly depended on the crop type.

25|$|These <b>ploughs</b> {{date back}} to the days of the steam engine and the horse.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of soil tillage depth is {{of special interest}} in organic farming. However, shallow <b>ploughing</b> often results in higher weed abundances in comparison to deep <b>ploughing.</b> Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate whether the high weed suppressive ability of spring and winter pea-cereal intercrops can compensate for the higher weed growth in shallow <b>ploughing</b> compared to deep <b>ploughing</b> in organic farming. Peas and cereals were grown as sole crops and intercrops under shallow and deep <b>ploughing</b> in experiments on a sandy loam soil in Northern Germany in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Semi-leafless spring peas-oats, semi-leafless winter peas-triticale and regular-leaf type winter peas-triticale intercrops were examined. At harvest, weed shoot biomass in semi-leafless spring and winter pea sole crops under deep <b>ploughing</b> were slightly higher than those of the corresponding intercrops under shallow <b>ploughing.</b> Whereas weed shoot biomass in semi-leafless winter peas-triticale intercrops under deep <b>ploughing</b> was comparable to shallow <b>ploughing,</b> the cultivation of spring peas-oats intercrops under shallow <b>ploughing</b> led to a significantly higher weed growth than did deep <b>ploughing.</b> The regular-leaf type winter pea grown as a sole crop, or an intercrop with triticale, showed a higher weed suppressive ability than the semi-leafless peas. The tillage system had no significant influence on the weed infestation of sole and intercropped regular-leaf type winter peas. Semi-leafless spring peas-oats and winter peas-triticale intercrops could compensate for weed infestation differences under shallow <b>ploughing</b> compared to the corresponding pea sole crops under deep <b>ploughing.</b> Due to the high weed suppressive ability of regular-leaf type winter peas, shallow <b>ploughing</b> and deep <b>ploughing,</b> as well as sole cropping and intercropping, led to comparable weed infestation...|$|R

25|$|The {{advent of}} the mobile steam engine allowed steam power {{to be applied to}} {{ploughing}} from about 1850. In Europe, soil conditions were often too soft to support the weight of heavy traction engines. Instead, counterbalanced, wheeled <b>ploughs,</b> known as balance <b>ploughs,</b> were drawn by cables across the fields by pairs of ploughing engines on opposite field edges, or by a single engine drawing directly towards it at one end and drawing away from it via a pulley at the other end. The balance plough had two sets of <b>ploughs</b> facing each other, arranged so when one was in the ground, the other set was lifted into the air. When pulled in one direction, the trailing <b>ploughs</b> were lowered onto the ground by the tension on the cable. When the plough reached the edge of the field, the other engine pulled the opposite cable, and the plough tilted (balanced), putting the other set of shares into the ground, and the plough worked back across the field.|$|E

Local parallel sliced method divides the cutting tool into several slices that are perpendicular to the tool axis along the local coordinate system. On each layer, the removal chip area is dividing into <b>ploughing</b> zone and shearing zone by the minimum chip thickness. <b>Ploughing</b> zone is the area as chip thickness {{is less than the}} minimum chip thickness.
