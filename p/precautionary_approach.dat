Inspired by “The {{worth of}} a songbird” by Funtowicz and Ravetz (1994) {{we use the}} value of a wildflower as symbol of the {{complexity}} of evaluating environmental qualities and risks. We critically discuss the application of cost-benefit analysis in evaluating environmental impacts of adoption of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We argue that costbenefit analysis should be supplemented with other methods, such as processes for assessing uncertainty, accommodation of scientific disagreements, and integration of stakeholders’ interests and perspectives. A more inclusive perspective is to develop <b>precautionary</b> <b>approaches</b> that recognize the multidimensional nature of environmental qualities and risks, such as irreplaceability, irreversibility, uncertainty and complexity. <b>Precautionary</b> <b>approaches</b> can contribute to develop a stronger environmental responsibility within the framework of rational self-interest.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>precautionary</b> <b>approaches</b> to managing possible health risks mobile telecommunications (MT) technology may cause or exacerbate public concerns. In contrast, <b>precautionary</b> <b>approaches</b> to managing such risks in the UK have been framed as a way of reducing public concerns. This article presents evidence from a series of focus groups about publics ‟ understandings of the actions taken and advice given about potential MT health risks by the UK government. Eight focus groups were conducted with members of the public that varied in their age, their awareness and concern about mast siting, and the self-reported level of mobile phone use. From the analyses a complex picture emerged in which publics‟ understandings were not primarily framed in terms of precautionary action and advice either provoking concern or providing reassurance. People made sense of precaution by drawing upon a range of evidence from their understandings of costs and benefits of the technology, as well as the institutional context in which MT health risks were managed. For some of those involved in protesting against mast siting, precaution was seen as confirming existing concern. Further systematic exploration of the contexts within which different responses to precaution emerge i...|$|R

2500|$|The Fishery Manager's Guidebook {{issued in}} 2009 by the FAO of the United Nations, advises that the <b>precautionary</b> <b>approach</b> or {{principle}} {{should be applied}} when [...] "ecosystem resilience and human impact (including reversibility) are difficult to forecast and hard to distinguish from natural changes." [...] The precautionary principle suggests that when an action risks harm, {{it should not be}} proceeded with until it can be scientifically proven to be safe. Historically fishery managers have applied this principle the other way round; fishing activities have not been curtailed [...] until it has been proven that they have already damaged existing ecosystems. In a paper published in 2007, Shertzer and Prager suggested that there can be significant benefits to stock biomass and fishery yield if management is stricter and more prompt. This is supported by recent work on the management of North Sea fisheries in accordance with ranges of acceptable fishing, where fishing {{at the top of the}} [...] "acceptable" [...] ranges is many times more risky than fishing near the bottom, but delivers only 20% more yield.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{topic for}} studies of STS and globalization are the ways “global” institutions create {{and attempt to}} implement health guidelines and safety standards to address risks associated with new technologies. In the following discussion this topic is examined through {{a case study of}} the activities of the World Health Organization’s Electric and Magnetic Field Project (WHO EMF Project). EMF exposures are associated with telecommunications and electrical infrastructure, most notably high voltage power-lines, radio and cell towers and the use of mobile telephones. The controversy over setting international safety standards and health guidelines has simmered for a number of decades. The mainstream “regulatory science” position has been that it is unlikely EMF’s constitute a significant health risk and therefore minimal regulatory intervention or significant precautionary considerations are required. A small but persistent stream of scientific studies nevertheless have continued to raise significant health concerns and have led to calls for regulators to build stronger <b>precautionary</b> <b>approaches</b> into EMF standards and guidelines. The WHO EMF project was established in 1996 in an attempt to discourage this situation leading to different nation states adopting strong <b>precautionary</b> <b>approaches</b> and developing a diversity of national EMF safety standards and health guidelines. In the following discussion I will explore the history of the WHO EMF Project and the strategies it has used to pursue its goal of global harmonization of EMF science, safety standards and guidelines. Three important strategies used by the WHO EMF Project have involved: appeals to technological determinism, developing bespoke models for sound science, and setting the boundaries between science and policy to attempt to exclude their opponents from the policy making arena...|$|R

40|$|With {{focus on}} {{biodiversity}} {{as a key}} element of sustainability, this paper contributes to the discussion of how to improve the knowledge basis for application of <b>precautionary</b> <b>approaches</b> in policies for biodiversity protection. From the perspectives of strong sustainability, precaution and ecological economics, currently proposed sustainable development indicators (SDI) are generally not sufficiently sensitive or adequate in terms of detecting environmental problems, in particular with regard to critical ecosystem trends and thresholds. The new Nature Index for Norway, currently being elaborated, is a highly promising effort to “make nature visible ” in order to reach the attention of policy makers and improve the basis for biodiversity protection. An important challenge is to ensure that appropriate “early warnings ” for biodiversity loss also are made available. This paper discusses how the Nature Index can be supplemented with the best available information on early warnings from the involved scientific experts...|$|R

40|$|The precautionary {{principle}} (PP) only represents {{a new approach}} to managing uncertainty in so far that it requires proponents of an activity or substance to provide evidence that the activity/substance is harmless, as opposed to the more traditional "trial and error" approach that has instead placed the burden of proof that something is harmful on its opponents. This article critiques the PP as a policy making tool for managing uncertainty, focusing on the epistemological problems it raises, before then using the International Whaling Commission's experience with <b>precautionary</b> <b>approaches</b> to wildlife management to demonstrate the principle's limits and weaknesses when applied in a highly politicised policymaking environment. The article concludes that while the PP offers some benefits for managing uncertainty, its vagueness and openness to broad interpretation can also result in its application creating, rather than limiting, risks and uncertainty.

Historical examples and existing scholarly analyses of environmental assurance bonding are reviewed, and the resulting lessons are situated within the larger debate over economic cost-benefit balancing and <b>precautionary</b> <b>approaches</b> to environmental law and policy. In particular, the paper argues that environmental assurance bonding displays the virtue of symmetric humility, paying due heed to the dynamism and complexity both of sociolegal systems such as markets and of biophysical systems such as aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The {{enactment}} of ocean-related legal and policy instruments {{and the establishment}} of ocean-mandated institutions driven by the United Nations in the past 30 years have not succeeded in protecting the oceans and their resources as the continuing depletion of ocean resources and deterioration of marine ecosystems attest. It is assumed that the overall system of ocean governance is plagued by problems characterised by a sectoral approach towards management and uncoordinated proliferation of legal and policy instruments as well as institutional organisations. This thesis utilises principles of international law as analytical tools to argue that their introduction in the legal and institutional frameworks for ocean governance can contribute to reducing these governance problems. These principles are cooperation, integration, ecosystem and <b>precautionary</b> <b>approaches.</b> The selected principles of international law were chosen because all of them are compatible with the notion that ocean problems are interrelated and multi-dimensional in their nature. It is argued that the negative effects of the governance problems can be reduced if the interrelated and multi-dimensional nature of the oceans is recognised through the inclusion of the principles of international law within the text of ocean-related legal and policy instruments and in the practice of ocean-mandated institutions. It is concluded that the inclusion of the above-referred principles in several of the ocean-related policy and legal instruments and in the practice of some institutions contributed to a shift in paradigm in ocean governance from a prevalence of sectoral views and uncoordinated proliferation of legal and policy instruments and institutions to a more holistic approach in ocean management. The thesis gives particular consideration to linkages (or their absence) among sectoral management initiatives from a legal and institutional perspective. The results suggest that despite the shift to a more holistic approach in ocean management, there still remain problems due to the prevalence of a dichotomy in ocean governance between the widespread approach towards single use and sectoral management and new approaches that support more integrated, cooperating, ecosystem and <b>precautionary</b> <b>approaches</b> towards ocean governance. This thesis also offers suggestions on how some of the persisting governance problems can be overcome...|$|R
