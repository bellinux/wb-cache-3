5|$|Ruthenium is a {{component}} of mixed-metal oxide (MMO) anodes used for cathodic protection of underground and submerged structures, and for electrolytic cells for such processes as generating chlorine from salt water. The fluorescence of some ruthenium complexes is quenched by oxygen, finding use in optode sensors for oxygen. Ruthenium red, 6+, is a biological stain used to stain <b>polyanionic</b> molecules such as pectin and nucleic acids for light microscopy and electron microscopy. The beta-decaying isotope 106 of ruthenium is used in radiotherapy of eye tumors, mainly malignant melanomas of the uvea. Ruthenium-centered complexes are being researched for possible anticancer properties. Compared with platinum complexes, those of ruthenium show greater resistance to hydrolysis and more selective action on tumors.|$|E

5000|$|Normally, joint cartilages have {{proteoglycan}} complexes, {{which are}} proteins with side chains made of glycosaminoglycans such as keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate attached to strands of hyaluronic acid. The glycosaminoglycan side chains are <b>polyanionic,</b> which causes adjacent side chains to push each other away {{and create a}} [...] "bottle brush", where hyaluronic acid is the stem and the side chains are the bristles.

5000|$|This feature {{requires}} {{the orientation of}} cationic -hydrophilic on one side, and hydrophobic residues {{on the other side}} of the helix. The attachment of fluorescent group on one head of the molecule confers contrast properties.A new strategy to enhance the cellular up-take capacity of CPP is based on association of polycationic and <b>polyanionic</b> domains that are separated by a linker. Cellular association of polycationic residues (polyarginine) with negatively charged membrane cells is effectively blocked by the presence of <b>polyanionic</b> residue (poly-glutamic acid) and the linker, which confer the proper distance between these two charged residues in order to maximize their interaction. These peptides adopt hairpin structure, confirmed by overhauser effect correlation for proton-proton proximities of the two charged moieties.At this stage only the linker is exposed to protease hydrolysis in vivo applications. The linker hydrolysis occur and the two charged fragments experience more conformational freedom. In the absence of linker, the cationic peptide can interact more efficient with the target cell and cellular uptake occurs before proteolysis. This strategy found applications in labeling tumor cells in vivo. Tumor cells were marked in minutes.Linker degradation can be predicted by the amount of D-aminoacids (the unnatural isomer) incorporated in the peptide chain, this restricts in vivo proteolysis to the central linker.|$|E

50|$|Biological cell {{membranes}} and cell walls are <b>polyanionic</b> surfaces. This {{has important implications}} for the transport of ions, in particular because {{it has been shown that}} different membranes preferentially bind different ions. Both Mg2+ and Ca2+ regularly stabilize membranes by the cross-linking of carboxylated and phosphorylated head groups of lipids. However, the envelope membrane of E. coli has also been shown to bind Na+, K+, Mn2+ and Fe3+. The transport of ions is dependent on both the concentration gradient of the ion and the electric potential (ΔΨ) across the membrane, which will be affected by the charge on the membrane surface. For example, the specific binding of Mg2+ to the chloroplast envelope has been implicated in a loss of photosynthetic efficiency by the blockage of K+ uptake and the subsequent acidification of the chloroplast stroma.|$|E
50|$|Raymond and {{coworkers}} developed a supramolecular host M4L6 (4 gallium ions and 6 ligands for each complex) that self-assembles via metal-ligand interaction in aqueous solution. This container molecule is <b>polyanionic</b> and thus its tetrahedron-shaped cavity {{is capable of}} encapsulating and stabilizing a cationic molecule. Consequently, encapsulated molecule can be easily protonated as a resulting carbocation from protonation is stabilized by the surrounding anions. Raymond utilized this property to perform acid-catalyzed Nazarov cyclization. The catalyst accelerates the reaction by over one million fold, making it the most efficient supramolecular catalyst to date. It was proposed that such a high catalytic activity does not arise just from the increased basicity of the encapsulated substrate {{but also from the}} constrictive binding that stabilize the transition state of the cyclization. Unfortunately, this catalyst has a problem with product inhibition. To by pass that problem, the product of the cyclization reaction could be reacted with a dienophile transforming it into a Diels-Alder adduct that no longer fits inside the catalyst cavity.|$|E

The approximate genome sequence of Z. marina is 202.3 Mb and encodes approximately 20450 protein-coding genes (of which 86,6% are supported by trancriptome data). The assembled genome was found to consist {{of large numbers of}} repeat elements accounting for 63% of the assembled genome. The researchers revealed key adaptations at the molecular biological level that have occurred during evolution of Z. marina, an angiosperm that has adopted a marine lifestyle. Genome analysis revealed that Z. marina lost the entire repertoire of stomatal genes, genes involved in volatile compound biosynthesis and signaling (such as ethylene and terpenoids) as well as genes for ultraviolet protection and phytochromes used for far-red sensing. Besides these gene losses, also gene gain events have been described, mostly involving the adjustment to full salinity and ion homeostasis. Also macro-algae like cell wall components (low-methylated <b>polyanionic</b> pectins and sulfated galatans) have been described, unique for Z. marina compared to other angiosperms.|$|E
50|$|Water-based {{drilling}} mud most commonly consists of bentonite clay (gel) with additives such as barium sulfate (barite), calcium carbonate (chalk) or hematite. Various thickeners {{are used to}} influence the viscosity of the fluid, e.g. xanthan gum, guar gum, glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, <b>polyanionic</b> cellulose (PAC), or starch. In turn, deflocculants are used to reduce viscosity of clay-based muds; anionic polyelectrolytes (e.g. acrylates, polyphosphates, lignosulfonates (Lig) or tannic acid derivates such as Quebracho) are frequently used. Red mud was the name for a Quebracho-based mixture, named after {{the color of the}} red tannic acid salts; it was commonly used in the 1940s to 1950s, then was made obsolete when lignosulfonates became available. Other components are added to provide various specific functional characteristics as listed above. Some other common additives include lubricants, shale inhibitors, fluid loss additives (to control loss of drilling fluids into permeable formations). A weighting agent such as barite is added to increase the overall density of the drilling fluid so that sufficient bottom hole pressure can be maintained thereby preventing an unwanted (and often dangerous) influx of formation fluids.|$|E
50|$|Soil, {{consisting}} of <b>polyanionic</b> clays and silicates, generally has a net anionic charge. Consequently, ammonium (NH4+) binds tightly {{to the soil}} but nitrate ions (NO3−) do not. Because nitrate is more mobile, it leaches into groundwater supplies through agricultural runoff. Wildlife such as amphibians, freshwater fish, and insects are sensitive to nitrate levels, and {{have been known to}} cause death and developmental anomalies in affected species. In addition, because they easily leach into groundwater, contributing to eutrophication, a process in which large algal blooms reduce oxygen levels in bodies of water and lead to death in oxygen-consuming creatures due to anoxia. Nitrification is also thought to contribute to the formation of photochemical smog, ground level ozone, acid rain, changes in species diversity, and other undesirable processes. In addition, nitrification inhibitors have also been shown to suppress the oxidation of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, to CO2. Both nitrapyrin and acetylene are shown to be especially strong suppressors of both processes, although the modes of action distinguishing them are unclear.|$|E
5000|$|Intercalation as a {{mechanism}} of interaction between cationic, planar, polycyclic aromatic systems of the correct size (on {{the order of a}} base pair) was first proposed by Leonard Lerman in 1961.

The ligand displaces a sodium and/or magnesium cation present in the [...] "condensation cloud" [...] of such cations that surrounds DNA (to partially balance the sum of the negative charges carried by each phosphate oxygen), thus forming a weak electrostatic association with the outer surface of DNA. From this position, the ligand diffuses along the surface of the DNA and may slide into the hydrophobic environment found between two base pairs that may transiently [...] "open" [...] to form an intercalation site, allowing the ethidium to move away from the hydrophilic (aqueous) environment surrounding the DNA and into the intercalation site. The base pairs transiently form such openings due to energy absorbed during collisions with solvent molecules.|$|E

40|$|Partial {{digestion}} of {{polygalacturonic acid}} with polygalacturonase isolated from Rhizopus stolonifer produces {{a mixture of}} α- 1, 4 -d-galacturonide oligomers which act to elicit casbene synthetase activity in castor bean (Ricinus communis L). These oligomers were separated by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE Sephadex A- 25 into discrete sizes and their degrees of polymerization were analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. A minimum degree of polymerization of nine units appears to be required for elicitor activity; trideca-α- 1, 4 -d-galacturonide was the most active of the oligomers tested. Methyl-esterification of the carboxylate groups greatly diminishes the elicitor activity of the oligomers, a finding which suggests a requirement for the <b>polyanionic</b> character of the oligomers for full activity.
