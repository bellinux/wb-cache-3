50|$|Many IVTs {{result from}} the {{combination}} of a CVT with a planetary gear system which enforces an IVT output shaft rotation speed which is equal to the difference between two other speeds within the IVT. This IVT configuration uses its CVT as a continuously variable regulator (CVR) of the rotation speed of any one of the three rotators of the planetary gear system (PGS). If two of the PGS rotator speeds are the input and output of the CVR, there is a setting of the CVR that results in the IVT output speed of zero. The maximum output/input ratio can be chosen from infinite practical possibilities through selection of additional input or output <b>gear,</b> <b>pulley</b> or sprocket sizes without affecting the zero output or the continuity of the whole system. The IVT is always engaged, even during its zero output adjustment.|$|R

40|$|This {{work was}} aimed at the design, {{construction}} and performance evaluation of a groundnut oil clarifier. The oil clarifier consists of two cylindrical tanks. The first tank {{was connected to the}} stirrer, bevel <b>gear,</b> <b>pulley</b> and motor while the second tank has a heating element and is insulated with a lagging material (rock wool). The machine was designed to clarify groundnut oil in order to improve its edible quality there by reducing its Free Fatty Acid, phospholipids, waxes, gums and some metal compound content in the oil and also eliminate the drudgery and constraints associated with the crude/traditional clarification methods. The performance of the machine was evaluated for the stirring, settling and heating time of the oil and the optimum operating conditions of rotational speed of the shaft and stirrer by degumming and neutralizing the crude groundnut oil with water and neutralizing reagents in the first tank after which is then transferred into the second tank via pump and pipe connections for heating so as to evaporate the available water to the required moisture content for safe storage. The test showed that the maximum efficiency of the clarifier was obtained using the sodium hydroxide reagent for neutralization and oil recovery which were 81. 4 % and 93. 41 % on the average respectively...|$|R
