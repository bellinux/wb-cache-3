30|$|Our {{results show}} that {{increasing}} the precursor pulse and <b>purge</b> <b>times</b> is {{an effective way to}} suppress the formation of hazy regions in the ALD coatings. The knife coated with 140  nm Al 2 O 3 ALD film (Fig.  3 c), where a 1  s TMA pulse and 4  s nitrogen purge (bottom) was used, showed no visible hazy regions in the coating (note that the colored areas {{at the tip of the}} knives are artifacts of edge diffraction, which produces dispersion according to wavelength, along with the chromatic aberration of the lens used in making the image; these are present even in the absence of a coating, as seen in Fig.  3 a). EDS analysis, shown in the second column of Table  1, revealed the presence of aluminum across the surface of the knife, indicating complete coverage by the Al 2 O 3 ALD film. Our results indicate that longer pulse and <b>purge</b> <b>times</b> are required for complex 3 D objects, particularly near supports, to allow the precursors and by-products adequate time to diffuse to all portions of the object. Understanding the precursor reaction and transport, tortuous diffusion paths and ALD chamber flow dynamics around complex objects is critical and an area of ongoing study [41 – 43].

30|$|The {{effect of}} CO 2 plasma <b>purge</b> <b>time</b> on the GPC {{is shown in}} Fig.  2 b. As {{in the case of}} BTBAS <b>purge</b> <b>time</b> dependency, GPC values are found to remain {{constant}} when CO 2 <b>purge</b> <b>time</b> is varied between 0.5 and 3 [*]s. Thus, it can be concluded that the applied <b>purge</b> <b>time</b> of both precursors has a negligible impact on the GPC of our SiO 2 thin films. This differs from an earlier reported PEALD process with SAM. 24, one kindred aminosilanes of BTBAS, and O 2 plasma [9], where purge steps with a <b>purge</b> <b>time</b> shorter than 2 [*]s were found to {{have a significant effect on}} film growth. Here, the independence between our applied precursor <b>purge</b> <b>time</b> and the GPC could be assigned to the effective removal of residual precursors and byproducts which could partially benefit from the reaction chamber design using the cross-flow. Such configuration makes the gas exchange time between precursor pulses relatively short. Nevertheless, the stickiness of precursors cannot be ruled out. Based on the results shown in Fig.  2 a, by using BTBAS pulse/purge time of 0.3 [*]s/ 3 [*]s and CO 2 plasma exposure/purge time of 3 [*]s/ 2 [*]s, the highest deposition speed during the saturated growth is 50 [*]nm/h. This implies that by applying a high plasma power and using BTBAS pulse/purge time of 0.1 [*]s/ 0.5 [*]s and CO 2 plasma exposure/purge time of 3 [*]s/ 0.5 [*]s, a deposition speed of up to 100 [*]nm/h is achievable.|$|E

Specifically, the electrochemical performance of three types of electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction, based respectively on a hollow core mesoporous shell carbon (HCMSC), an ultrasonic spray pyrolysis mesoporous carbon (USPMC) and a graphene reduced oxide (GRO) were compared. These catalysts were then evaluated electrochemically in a three-electrode one-compartment cell, using a 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution as electrolyte, an auxiliary electrode and a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray scattering (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out in order to understand chemical-physical phenomenon, and electrochemical tests were conducted via linear sweet voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV).

50|$|In a prototypical ALD process, a {{substrate}} {{is exposed}} to two reactants A and B in a sequential, non-overlapping way. In contrast to other techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), where thin film growth proceeds on a steady-state fashion, in ALD each reactant reacts with the surface in a self-limited way: the reactant molecules can react only with {{a finite number of}} reactive sites on the surface. Once all those sites have been consumed in the reactor, the growth stops. The remaining reactant molecules are flushed away and only then reactant B is inserted into the reactor.

Full-cycle ALD simulations reveal that the depositions of nano-thin-films in ALD are in essence the chemisorption of the gaseous species and the conversion of surface species.

Thermal desorption is a technique used in the recovery of sampled airborne organic compounds from solid adsorbent trapping media. There are several advantages of this technique over solvent desorption: 1) absence of the toxic solvent; 2) greater concentration of the sample; 3) higher detection sensitivity. Most organic compounds are known to be unstable at high temperatures. The thermal stability of the organic compounds is an important parameter that must be determined before considering a thermal desorption process. Two major variables, which affect the desorption <b>purge</b> <b>time</b> when organic compounds are desorbed from a charcoal tube by thermal means, are the temperature and carrier gas flow rate. In this study, a modified gas chromatograph apparatus was used to measure the 1, 3 -butadiene desorption <b>purge</b> <b>time</b> under various desorption conditions. The thermal stability of 1, 3 -butadiene at various temperatures was also investigated by measuring the percent recovery.
