500|$|The {{entertainment}} news site Mandatory said Partridge was [...] "a fascinatingly layered and fully realised creation {{of years of}} storytelling and a fundamentally contemptible prick — he feels like a living, breathing person, but a living, breathing <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want to strangle." [...] The Telegraph credited Partridge with influencing [...] "awkward" [...] sitcoms such as The Inbetweeners, Nighty Night and Peep Show, and wrote: [...] "Never has one actor so completely inhabited a sitcom character. We believe Partridge is real, from his side-parted hair down to his tasseled sports-casual loafers." [...] In 2014, Guardian writer Stuart Heritage described Partridge as [...] "one of the greatest and most beloved comic creations {{of the last few}} decades." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{spoke with}} Larry King on CNN, {{supporting}} the It Gets Better Project and The Trevor Project, {{a non-profit organization}} providing crisis and suicide prevention for LGBT youth, {{in light of the}} high profile suicides committed in Fall, 2010. She stated: [...] "(I was) one of those kids... holding everything inside... internalizing everything. And that really can affect you, and feeling helpless and hopeless, and finding that <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can trust, that adult, like I did later on in life, that I felt comfortable and safe to tell my issues, my worries, my pains, my aches to. This is what the Trevor Project is really all about. And they have a 24-hour hotline... There's someone there that you can speak with 24 hours that will be there for you." [...] She made an official It Gets Better video which was released on December 1, 2010.|$|E
500|$|... "Siempre Tú" [...] was {{composed}} by Muñiz in Los Angeles {{along with its}} producers Nico Stadi and Mike Green. It was recorded {{in the same city}} at the Pulse Music Group Studios. The idea of the song came to Muñiz after he started to say phrases [...] "like when you think about your girlfriend" [...] accompanied by a piano and an electric guitar. In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song with which you can tell a <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> miss her, that you are always thinking about her and longing to be with her. This was the idea of the track". Stan and Muñiz were linked by producer Gabriel Huiban, who previously worked with the latter. [...] "Siempre Tú" [...] was released worldwide on 21 April 2017 through Warner Music Mexico. The accompanying cover artwork shows Muñiz sitting on a chair looking off in the far distance against a backdrop of a street with tall buildings.|$|E

500|$|After marrying and {{becoming}} a father, Miller put aside his music career to be a fireman in Amarillo, Texas. A fireman by day, he performed at night. Miller said that as a fireman he saw only two fires, one in a [...] "chicken coop" [...] and another he [...] "slept through," [...] after which the department [...] "suggested that... seek other employment." [...] Miller met Ray Price, and {{became a member of}} his Cherokee Cowboys. He returned to Nashville and wrote [...] "Invitation to the Blues," [...] which was covered by Rex Allen and later by Ray Price, whose recording was a number three hit on country charts. Miller then signed with Tree Publishing on a salary of $50 a week. He wrote: [...] "Half a Mind" [...] for Ernest Tubb, [...] "That's the Way I Feel" [...] for Faron Young; and his first number one, [...] "Billy Bayou," [...] which along with [...] "Home" [...] was recorded by Jim Reeves. Miller became one of the biggest songwriters of the 1950s; however, Bill Anderson would later remark that [...] "Roger was the most talented, and least disciplined, <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could imagine," [...] citing the attempts of Miller's Tree Publishing boss, Buddy Killen to force him to finish a piece. He was known to give away lines, inciting many Nashville songwriters to follow him around since, according to Killen, [...] "everything he said was a potential song." ...|$|E
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

After her husband was murdered Mary professed {{not to have any}} {{knowledge}} on why her husband was shot to death, practically on the front steps of their home. She stated to the press that she was convinced that her husband's murder was not [...] "one of those gangland slayings". She would later say that William was a [...] "quiet man", a [...] "fine husband" [...] and a [...] "wonderful father, and that he (wasn't) the type of <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would associate with gangsters." [...] Contrary to statements made by his wife, FBI documents report that O'Sullivan had a reputation as a [...] "tough guy" [...] and a prosperous loanshark because he was a close associate of Stephen Flemmi and Frank Salemme.|$|E

So what I do is say, [...] "yes it is rotten food, let us sing a song", making sure that that particular chanson has a few vowels in it that require her to open her mouth! During which I pop the spoon in and I have won the argument.

2500|$|... "Everything to Me", the album's fourth {{track and}} {{official}} first single, reunited Monica with producer Missy Elliott {{and saw the}} pair basically reprising the formula of previous successes such as [...] "So Gone" [...] (2003) and [...] "A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me)" [...] (2006). A musical ode to all things good in life, written by singer Jazmine Sullivan, the retro ballad contains a prominent sample of the Deniece Williams' 1981 recording [...] "Silly." [...] Released to rave reviews among critics, who noted it the album's [...] "standout track — as solid as a brick house; great singing, great lyrics, great production, just a great all-around song," [...] "Everything to Me" [...] became the singer's most-successful release in years. Elliott also contributed [...] "If You Were My Man", {{one of the few}} up tempo songs on Still Standing, which Monica described as the song, who was most out of her character. Originally titled [...] "Betcha", the track samples Evelyn [...] "Champagne" [...] King's 1982 record [...] "Betcha She Don't Love You", featuring heavy elements of 1980's music, and garnered a mixed response by critics, whose reviews of the song alternated between [...] "blemish," [...] "brainless," [...] and [...] "funky". [...] "Mirror", the sixth track produced by Jim Jonsin, was recorded late into the production of the album. A song about self-acceptance, Monica noted the composition one of her personal standouts on the album: [...] "Its basically about being able to look at yourself in the mirror and be completely happy with the <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are," [...] she said. [...] "Having no shame or feeling pain again, and I am at that place in my life." ...|$|E

5000|$|The band re-released their single Spirit on October 15, 2014, via Bandcamp. Spirit {{features}} vocals from Nora Patterson of Royal Teeth.

6000|$|... 'And {{exactly to}} the kind of <b>person</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wanted, a man who will take a pride, {{although}} merely a tenant, in not permitting his poor neighbours to feel the want of a landlord. You will never guess: Lord Mildmay!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Please, sir,' said Bradshaw complainingly, 'I can't {{open the}} door.'
