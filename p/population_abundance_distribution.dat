We also study the effect of internal fluctuations on the long-time dynamics for the different models that have been widely used in the literature, such as the theta-logistic and Savageau models. In particular, we determine the conditions for population extinction and calculate the mean time to extinction. If the population does not become extinct, we obtain analytical expressions for the <b>population</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>distribution.</b> Our theoretical results are based on WKB theory and the probability generating function formalism and are verified by numerical simulations.

40|$|Within {{the field}} of spatial ecology, it is {{important}} to study animal movements in order to better understand population dynamics. Dispersal is a nonlinear process through which different behavioral mechanisms could affect movement patterns. One of the most common approaches to analyzing the trajectories of organisms within patches is to use random-walk models to describe movement features. These models express individual movements within a specific area in terms of random-walk parameters in an effort to relate movement patterns to the distributions of organisms in space. However, only using the movement trajectories of individuals to predict the spatial spread of animal populations may not fit the complex distribution of individuals across heterogeneous environments. When we empirically tested the results from a random-walk model (a residence index) used to predict the spatial equilibrium distribution of individuals, we found that the index severely underestimated the spatial spread of dispersing individuals. We believe this is because random-walk models only account for the effects of environmental conditions on individual movements, completely overlooking the crucial influence of behavior changes over time. In the future, both aspects should be accounted for when predicting general rules of (meta) <b>population</b> <b>abundance,</b> <b>distribution,</b> and dynamics from patterns of animal movements. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

A total of 242 individuals of seahorses were sighted in the 11 transects surveyed in summer 2011. Hippocampus guttulatus (n = 225) were 14 times more abundant than H. hippocampus (17). The mean abundance of H. guttulatus {{for all the}} pooled sites was 0. 018 m- 2 (SE ± 0. 003) ranging from a maximum of 0. 035 (SE ± 0. 007) to a minimum of 0. 008 (SE ± 0. 002). The size structure of long-snouted seahorse shows a population ranging from 7 to 14 cm (SL) with a peak at 10 cm (TL). Juveniles (96. 0 ± 8. 0 mm) represent a significant fraction of the population, accounting more than 21 % of the sighted individuals. In Mar Piccolo, H. guttulatus is able to shelter both in monotonous habitats, including the algal beds, and diversified ones, such as the rich filter-feeder communities that colonize hard substrates. By contrast, H. hippocampus is mainly associated with habitats of low complexity. Today, the Mar Piccolo di Taranto {{is among the most}} heavily polluted water bodies in South Italy, with trace metals, hydrocarbons, pesticides and organic wastes affecting both biotic and abiotic matrices. However, despite the high level of degradation, the presence of a large mussel farm has avoided the impact of towed fishing gears, and eutrophication of water bodies has ensured a high trophic level that supports large crustacean populations, potential prey for seahorses...|$|E

While there are many important lessons to learn from the past, we believe that we cannot rely on past forest conditions to provide us with blueprints for future management. To respond to this uncertainty, managers will be challenged to integrate adaptation strategies into plans in response to changing climates. Adaptive strategies include resistance options, resilience options, response options, and realignment options. Our objectives are to present ideas that could be useful in developing plans under changing climates that could be applicable to forests with Mediterranean climates. We believe that managing for species persistence at the broad ecoregion scale is the most appropriate goal when considering the effects of changing climates. Such a goal relaxes expectations that current species ranges will remain constant, or that <b>population</b> <b>abundances,</b> <b>distribution,</b> species compositions and dominances should remain stable.

Bioinformatics, 25 (16), 2020 - 2027 Sponsorship: BBSRC MeTRO project and the EU project UNICELLSYS (FP 7 -Health- 201142) Motivation: Distribution analysis {{is one of the}} most basic forms of statistical analysis. Thanks to improved analytical methods, accurate and extensive quantitative measurements can now be made of the mRNA, protein and metabolite from biological systems. Here, we report a large-scale analysis of the population abundance distributions of the transcriptomes, proteomes and metabolomes from varied biological systems. Results: We compared the observed empirical distributions with a number of distributions: power law, lognormal, loglogistic, loggamma, right Pareto-lognormal (PLN) and double PLN (dPLN). The best-fit for mRNA, protein and metabolite population abundance distributions was found to be the dPLN. This distribution behaves like a lognormal distribution around the centre, and like a power law distribution in the tails. To better understand the cause of this observed distribution, we explored a simple stochastic model based on geometric Brownian motion. The distribution indicates that multiplicative effects are causally dominant in biological systems. We speculate that these effects arise from chemical reactions: the central-limit theorem then explains the central lognormal, and a number of possible mechanisms could explain the long tails: positive feedback, network topology, etc. Many of the components in the central lognormal parts of the empirical distributions are unidentified and/or have unknown function. This indicates that much more biology awaits discovery. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Catch {{per unit of}} effort, area-swept biomass estimates, and age and length {{compositions}} for 12 commercially important west coast groundfishes are presented to illustrate trends over the lO-year period. We discuss the precision, accuracy, and statistical significance of observed trends in abundance estimates. The influence of water temperature {{on the distribution of}} groundfishes is also briefly examined. Abundance estimates of canary rockfish, Sebastes pinniger, and yellowtail rockfish, S. Jlavidus, declined during the study period; greater declines were observed in Pacific ocean perch, S. alutus, lingcod, Ophiodon elongatus, and arrowtooth flounder, Atheresthes stomias. Biomass estimates of Pacific hake, Merluccius productus, and English, rex, and Dover soles (Pleuronectes vetulus, Errex zachirus, and Microstomus pacificus) increased, while bocaccio, S. paucispinis, and chilipepper, S. goodei, were stable. Sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, biomass estimates increased markedly from 1977 to 1980 and declined moderately thereafter. Precision was lowest for rockfishes, lingcod, and sablefish; it was highest for flatfishes because they were uniformly distributed. The accuracy of survey estimates could be gauged only for yellowtail and canary rockfish and sablefish. All fishery-based analyses produced much larger estimates of abundance than bottom trawl surveys-indicative of the true catchability of survey trawls. Population trends from all analyses compared well except in canary rockfish, the species that presents the greatest challenge to obtaining reasonable precision and one that casts doubts on the usefulness of bottom trawl surveys for estimating its abundance.

Taylor's power law (Taylor 1961 : Nature, 189 : 732 -) is well {{recognized as one of the}} fundamental models in population ecology. A fundamental property of biological populations, which Taylor's power law reveals, is the near universal heterogeneity of <b>population</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>distribution</b> in habitat. Obviously, the heterogeneity also exists at the community level, where not only the {{distributions of}} population abundances but also the proportions of the species composition in the community are often heterogeneous. Nevertheless, existing community diversity indexes such as Shannon index and Simpson index can only measure "local" or "static" diversity in the sense that they are computed for each habitat at a specific time point, and the indexes alone do not reflect the diversity changes. In this note, I propose to extend the application scope of Taylor's power law to the studies of human microbial communities, specifically, the community heterogeneity at both population and community levels. I further suggested that population dispersion models such as Taylor (1980 : Nature, 286, 53 -), which is known to generate population distribution patterns consistent with the power law, should also be very useful for analyzing the distribution patterns of human microbes within the human body. Overall, I hope that the approach to human microbial community with the power law offers an example that ecological theories can play an important role in the emerging medical ecology, which aims at studying the ecology of human microbiome and its implications to human diseases and health, as well as in personalized medicine...|$|E

40|$|The pillar coral, Dendrogyra cylindrus, {{has been}} {{commonly}} described as widely distributed, but rare throughout its geographical {{range in the}} Caribbean. Having recently been listed as Threatened under the US Endangered Species Act, an understanding of population status is needed to promote species conservation and population recovery. Previous to this study {{the status of the}} pillar coral population in the state waters of Florida, U. S. A, was relatively unknown primarily due to few colonies being recorded and no comprehensive summary of <b>population</b> <b>abundance,</b> <b>distribution</b> or health being completed. Along with various environmental and anthropogenic factors affecting the pillar coral population on the Florida Reef Tract (FRT), it appears that reproductive limitations may also be contributing to species decline and limiting population recovery as evidenced by the lack of reported juvenile D. cylindrus colonies reported on the Florida Reef Tract (FRT) in the past 17 years. The factors contributing to this phenomenon are currently unknown, however are suspected to be derived from the pillar corals reproductive biology. Being described as a gonochoric, broadcast spawner, sexual reproduction relies on the synchronous release of gametes from colonies of separate sexes, and with low adult colony densities reported for the pillar coral on the FRT, gamete concentrations from both sexes may be too low for fertilization to occur. In 2014 submissions of pillar coral locations from the scientific and lay community were compiled and 610 D. cylindrus colonies along Florida Reef Tract were identified (Lunz et al. 2016). In my study, I describe the population structure of D. cylindrus for the southeast Florida region of the FRT which includes 65 of the total 610 colonies. For each of the 65 colonies, colony depth, demographic, and condition data were recorded including size (length, width, and height), percent of recent mortality, and presence and severity of disease and bleaching. Out of all locations identified in this region, about 50 % contained only a single colony of D. cylindrus and the maximum number of colonies per site was 14. Throughout the duration of the study, devastating losses of live tissue were observed following the bleaching and disease events impacting the Florida Reef Tract in 2014, 2015, and 2016 and the status of the southeast Florida population of pillar coral is at serious risk of local extinction. To investigate the ability of colonies of D. cylindrus to sexually reproduce (referred to as sexual reproduction potential) tissue samples were collected from 95 colonies within 15 sites along the FRT and were prepared for histological analysis. The sex of each colony, sizes of gametes in mature developmental stages, the abundance of gametes per cm 2 of tissue, and sex ratios for locations on the FRT were reported. All tissue samples from male and female colonies contained gametes that were ≥ 90 % mature; however sex ratios were found to be skewed in all locations, deviating significantly from the 1 : 1 ratio expected for typical resource allocation in random mating. Hermaphroditic colonies of D. cylindrus are described for the first time throughout its geographical range in this study and comparisons to gonochoristic colonies confirmed that these hermaphrodites are sexually reproductive individuals. Results from this effort provide a more thorough understanding of the reproductive biology of D. cylindrus and essential data for the support of future conservation management and restoration strategies for this FRT population and comparative data for other Caribbean populations...|$|E
40|$|The Tangled Nature Model of {{biological}} and cultural evolution features interacting agents which compete for limited resources and reproduce in an error prone fashion {{and at a}} rate depending on the `tangle' of interactions they maintain with others. The set of interactions linking a TNM individual to others is key to its reproductive success and arguably constitutes its most important property. Yet, in many studies, the interactions of an individual and those of its mutated off-spring are unrelated, a rather unrealistic feature corresponding to a point mutation turning a giraffe into an elephant. To bring out the structural and dynamical effects of trait inheritance, we introduce and numerically analyze a family of TNM models where a positive integer K parametrises correlations between the interactions of an agent and those of its mutated offspring. For K= 1 a single point mutation randomizes all the interactions, while increasing K up {{to the length of}} the genome ensures an increasing level of trait inheritance. We show that the distribution of the interactions generated by our rule is nearly independent of the value of K. Changing K strengthens the core structure of the ecology, leads to <b>population</b> <b>abundance</b> <b>distributions</b> which are better approximated by log-normal probability densities and increases the probability that a species extant at time t_ w is also extant at a later time t. In particular, survival probabilities are shown to decay as powers of the ratio t/t_ w, similarity to the pure aging behaviour approximately describing glassy systems of physical origin. Increasing the value of K decreases the numerical value of the decay exponent of the power law, which is a clear quantitative dynamical effect of trait inheritance.

Humpback resightings and residency were comparatively higher in 1995 than in other years. Furthermore, minke whale resightings occurred in an area of heavy vessel activity in 1995. Reactions by individual cetaceans appeared to depend on the type of industrial activity. [...] Resightings of individually identified animals between years suggested long-term effects of industrial activity on cetaceans.

First, the spectral energy distribution in the mid-ultraviolet range 2000 < λ < 2400 ˚A exceeds observation by ∼ 0. 6 mag. Most of that excess is due to metal-poor main sequence stars. Second, the models do not reproduce metal-sensitive optical absorption features that arise mainly from red giant stars. Third, {{the strength of a}} Ca II index sensitive to hot stars does not jibe with the predicted number of A-type horizontal branch stars. The number of metal poor stars in galaxies is at least a factor of two less than predicted by the Simple model, exactly similar to the “G Dwarf problem ” in the solar cylinder. Observations at larger radii in local group galaxies indicate that the paucity of metal poor stars applies globally, rather than only in the nuclei. Because of the dominance of metal rich stars, primordial galaxies will have a plentiful dust supply early in their star formation history, and thus will probably have weak Lyα emission, as is apparently observed. We confirm that early-type galaxies cannot have been formed exclusively from mergers of small all-stellar subsystems, a result already established by dynamical simulations.

Most CEMP stars are enriched in $s$-elements (CEMP-$s$ stars), {{and some of these}} are also enriched in $r$-elements (CEMP-$s/r$ stars). One formation scenario proposed for CEMP stars invokes wind mass transfer in the past from a TP-AGB primary star to a less massive companion star which is presently observed. We generate low-metallicity populations of binary stars to reproduce the observed CEMP-star fraction. In addition, we aim to constrain our wind mass-transfer model and investigate under which conditions our synthetic <b>populations</b> reproduce observed <b>abundance</b> <b>distributions.</b> We compare the CEMP fractions and the <b>abundance</b> <b>distributions</b> determined from our synthetic populations with observations. Several physical parameters of the binary stellar population of the halo are uncertain, e. g. the initial mass function, the mass-ratio and orbital-period distributions, and the binary fraction. We vary the assumptions in our model about these parameters, as well as the wind mass-transfer process, and study the consequent variations of our synthetic CEMP population. The CEMP fractions calculated in our synthetic populations vary between 7 % and 17 %, a range consistent with the CEMP fractions among very metal-poor stars recently derived from the SDSS/SEGUE data sample. The results of our comparison between the modelled and observed <b>abundance</b> <b>distributions</b> are different for CEMP-$s/r$ stars and for CEMP-$s$ stars.

Methods Carabids were sampled using pitfall-traps in 188 ﬁelds of winter cereals and oilseed rape in three agricultural areas of western France contrasting in their spatial heterogeneity. We summarized landscape composition in the current and previous years in a multi-scale perspective, using buffers of increasing size around sampling locations. Results Both species were more abundant in oilseed rape, and in landscapes with a higher proportion of oilseed rape in the previous year. P. cupreus abundance was negatively inﬂuenced by oilseed rape proportion in the current year landscape in winter cereals and positively by winter cereal proportion in oilseed rape. A. dorsalis was globally impacted at ﬁner scales than P. cupreus.

Results of studies dealing with scale issues in marine benthic communities suggest that variability is concentrated at small spatial scales (from tens of centimetres to few metres) and that spatial patterns of variation are consistent across ecosystems characterized by contrasting physical and biotic conditions, but this has not been formally tested. Here we quantified the {{variability in}} the distribution of intertidal rocky shore communities at a range of spatial scales, from tens of centimetres to thousands of kilometres, both in the NE Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and tested whether the observed patterns differed between the two basins. We focused on canopy-forming macroalgae and associated understorey assemblages in the low intertidal, and on the distribution of Patella limpets at mid intertidal levels. Our results highlight that patterns of spatial variation, at each scale investigated, were consistent between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, suggesting that similar ecological processes operate in these regions. In contrast with former studies, variability in canopy cover, species richness and limpet abundance was equally distributed among spatial scales, possibly reflecting the fingerprint of multiple processes. Variability in community structure of low intertidal assemblages, instead, peaked at the largest scale, suggesting that oceanographic processes and climatic gradients may be important. We conclude that formal comparisons of variability across scales nested in contrasting systems are needed, before any generalization on patterns and processes can be made...|$|R
40|$|Large mammal faunas in {{tropical}} forest landscapes are widely affected by habitat fragmentation and hunting, yet the environmental determinants of their patterns of abundance remain poorly understood at large spatial scales. We analysed <b>population</b> <b>abundance</b> and biomass of 31 species of medium to large-bodied mammal species at 38 Atlantic forest sites (including three islands, 26 forest fragments and six continuous forest sites) {{as related to}} forest type, level of hunting pressure and forest fragment size using ANCOVAs. We also derived a novel measure of mammal conservation importance for each site based on a "Mammalian Conservation Priority index" (MPi) which incorporates information on species richness, <b>population</b> <b>abundance,</b> body size <b>distribution,</b> conservation status, and forest patch area. Mammal abundance was affected by hunting pressure, whereas mammalian biomass of which was largely driven by ungulates, was significantly influenced by both forest type and hunting pressure. The MPi index, when separated into its two main components (i. e. site forest area and species-based conservation index Ci), ordered sites along a gradient of management priorities that balances species-focused and habitat-focused conservation actions. Areas with the highest conservation priority were located in semi-deciduous forest fragments, followed by lowland forests. Many of these fragments, which are often embedded within large private landholdings including biofuel and citrus or coffee crops, cattle ranches and pulpwood plantations, could be used not only to comply with environmental legislation, but also enhance the prospects for biodiversity conservation, and reduce edge effects and hunting. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The western North Atlantic {{population}} of the northern right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) was severely depleted by whaling over the last century. Despite over fifty years of protection, fewer than four hundred individuals are believed {{to exist in the}} North Atlantic. Relatively {{little is known about the}} diving behavior, respiratory physiology, or diel activity of these whales, although such information could be useful in predicting <b>population</b> <b>abundance</b> and <b>distribution</b> in relation to food or environmental variables. Dive behavior data can be collected visually, but collection is limited to daylight hours, calm weather, and fortuitous encounters with study animals. Satellite-monitored radio tags offer the opportunity to collect data on individual whales' diving behavior continuously, over long distances and periods of time, and at relatively low cost. Thirteen North Atlantic right whales were tagged and monitored in the Gulf of Maine between 1989 and 1991. One male was tagged in 1989; two adult males, six adult females (two with calves) and one juvenile were tagged in 1990; one adult female (with a calf) and two juveniles were tagged in 1991. The duration of monitoring for the whales varied from < 1 day to 43 days. Characteristics of the radio tags were different over each year in order to evaluate different attachment mechanisms and methods of collecting and summarizing data for dive duration, dive frequency, and time submerged. These data were then used to describe the dive behavior and to predict aspects of the respiratory physiology for these whales. The number of dives, their duration, and the time submerged varied considerably among individual whales and between years. Over all, the whales spent 79...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequently}} observed {{positive relationship}} between fish <b>population</b> <b>abundance</b> and spatial <b>distribution</b> suggests that changes in distribution can be indicative of trends in abundance. If contractions in spatial distribution precede declines in spawning stock biomass (SSB), spatial distribution reference points could complement the SSB reference points that are commonly used in marine conservation biology and fisheries management. When relevant spatial distribution information is integrated into fisheries management and recovery plans, risks and uncertainties associated with a plan {{based solely on the}} SSB criterion would be reduced. To assess the added value of spatial distribution data, we examine the relationship between SSB and four metrics of spatial distribution intended to reflect changes in population range, concentration, and density for 10 demersal populations (9 species) inhabiting the Scotian Shelf, Northwest Atlantic. Our primary purpose is to assess their potential to serve as indices of SSB, using fisheries independent survey data. We find that metrics of density offer the best correlate of spawner biomass. A decline in the frequency of encountering high density areas is associated with, and in a few cases preceded by, rapid declines in SSB in 6 of 10 populations. Density-based indices have considerable potential to serve both as an indicator of SSB and as spatially based reference points in fisheries management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Red Sea and Gulf of Suez are {{characterized}} by their unique diversity of fish and invertebrate species. This study aimed to investigate the status {{of one of the}} most economically important bivalve species in the Gulf of Suez, the pearl oyster Pinctada radiata stock for the proper management of its <b>populations.</b> <b>Abundance</b> and <b>distribution</b> patterns of the species were studied by conducting a survey, using an underwater visual census technique, at which SCUBA diving were used to investigate the deep areas, while snorkeling were used at the shallower areas. The results showed a scattered distribution pattern of the species with very high population in El Gimsha Bay (northwestern Red Sea). The bay is characterized by a robust oyster population with very high densities (average 164 shell/m at the sea grass habitat), abundance (9. 84 million 2 shells) and biomass (4. 29 kg/m). Most of the population was recorded at depths from 4 to 6 m. Spatial 2 distribution of the oyster was correlated to the substrate type and it was found that the sea grass habitat is the favorite for P. radiata. During the survey a sample of 650 specimens were collected for further population structure studies. Size frequency distribution analysis indicated that the life span of the oyster is about 5 years and the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) estimates were: L = 10. 31 cm shell length (DVM) and 4 K = 0. 34 yearG. The instantaneous total, natural and fishing mortality coefficients were 0. 565, 0. 31 and 1 0. 255 respectively and the exploitation rate was 0. 452. In conclusion, pearl oyster stock in Gimsha Bay is healthy and keeping the fishing activity at safe rate will not affect the natural population...|$|R
40|$|Aim Adaptive trait {{continua}} are axes of covariation {{observed in}} multivariate trait data {{for a given}} taxonomic group. These continua quantify and summarize life-history variation at the inter-specific level in multi-specific assemblages. Here we examine whether trait continua can provide a useful framework to link life-history variation with demographic and evolutionary processes in species richness gradients. Taking an altitudinal species richness gradient for Mediterranean butterflies as a study case, we examined a suite of traits (larval diet breadth, adult phenology, dispersal capacity and wing length) and species-specific habitat measures (temperature and aridity breadth). We tested whether traits and species-specific habitat measures tend to co-vary, whether they are phylogenetically conserved, and whether {{they are able to}} explain species distributions and spatial genetic variation in a large number of butterfly assemblages. Location Catalonia, Spain. Methods We formulated predictions associated with species richness gradients and adaptive trait continua. We applied principal components analyses (PCAs), structural equation modelling and phylogenetic generalized least squares models. Results We found that traits and species-specific habitat measures covaried along a main PCA axis, ranging from multivoltine trophic generalists with high dispersal capacity to univoltine (i. e. one generation per year), trophic specialist species with low dispersal capacity. This trait continuum was closely associated with the observed distributions along the altitudinal gradient and predicted inter-specific differences in patterns of spatial genetic variability (FST and genetic distances), population responses to the impacts of global change and local turnover dynamics. Main conclusions The adaptive trait continuum of Mediterranean butterflies provides an integrative and mechanistic framework to: (1) analyse geographical gradients in species richness, (2) explain inter-specific differences in <b>population</b> <b>abundances,</b> spatial <b>distributions</b> and demographic trends, (3) explain inter-specific differences in patterns of genetic variation (FST and genetic distances), and (4) study specialistgeneralist life-history transitions frequently involved in butterfly diversification processes. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{last several}} years have seen an {{increased}} interest {{in the use of}} remote sensing to identify the location of penguin colonies in Antarctica, and the estimation of the abundance of breeding pairs contained therein. High-resolution (sub-meter) commercial satellite imagery (e. g., Worldview- 1, Quickbird) is capable of colony detection and abundance estimation for both large and small colonies, and has already been used in a continental-scale survey of Adélie penguins. Medium-resolution Landsat imagery has been used successfully to detect the presence of breeding penguins, but has not been used previously for abundance estimation nor evaluated in terms of its minimum colony size detection threshold. We report on the first comprehensive analysis of the performance of these two methods for both detection and abundance estimation, identify the sensor-specific failure modes that can lead to both false positives and false negatives, and compare the abundance estimates of each method over multiple spatial scales. We find that errors of omission using Landsat imagery are low for colonies larger than ∼ 10, 000 breeding pairs. Both high-resolution and Landsat imagery can be used to obtain unbiased estimates of abundance, and while Landsat-derived abundance estimates have high variance for individual breeding colonies relative to estimates derived from high-resolution imagery, this difference declines as the spatial domain of interest is increased. At the continental scale, abundance estimates using the two methods are roughly equivalent. Our comparison of these two methods represents a bridge between the more developed high-resolution imagery, which can be expensive to obtain, and the medium-resolution Landsat- 7 record, which is freely available; this comparison of methodologies represents an essential step towards integration of these disparate sources of data for regional assessments of Adélie <b>population</b> <b>abundance</b> and <b>distribution...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper draws {{together}} {{the themes of}} papers on procellariiform biology contained within this special issue of the Papers and Proceedings ofthe Royal Society ofTasmania which {{is a tribute to}} Irynej Skira. The role of these birds as generalised biomonitors of marine ecosystem health as well as their important interactions with commercial fisheries and human societies are major considerations. Seabird conservation faces challenges from introduced pest loss of habitat to urban development, marine pollution and climate and oceanographic changes. Studies are hampered by the difficulties of dealing with birds in remote areas (that are therefore expensive to study), a paucity of funds and problems of overlapping national and international jurisdictions in their individual home ranges or on their migration routes. There is a real need for long-term studies ofseabirds because they have delayed breeding systems, a slow rate ofreproduction, long life-spans and high adult survival. Such knowledge is important in understanding their population dynamics, the effects of changing climate, the impacts of commercial fishing, pollution, breeding habitat loss and the harvesting of chicks. The value of the long-term studies of Shorttailed Shearwaters, Puffinus tenuirostris on Fisher Island, Tasmania, is considered {{in the light of the}} importance of research investment in basic curiosity-driven research. Neglect of long-term studies and the diminishing role of local scientific journals in the dissemination of baseline data on which to build generalities are the result of changing priorities of government and other funding agencies towards shortterm output-based assessment models. Our present inability to answer the basic question of what determines seabird <b>population</b> <b>abundance</b> and <b>distribution</b> highlights a lack of fundamental population data in Austral seabird research. This must be addressed so that a mixture of comparative, experimental and modelling studies can be mobilised to complement descriptive studies...|$|R

The species <b>abundance</b> <b>distribution</b> {{is one of the most}} ubiquitous patterns in nature and many models have been proposed to explain the mechanisms that generate this pattern. While there have been numerous comparisons of species <b>abundance</b> <b>distribution</b> models, most of these comparisons only use a small subset of available models, focus on a single ecosystem or taxonomic group, and fail to use the most appropriate statistical methods. This makes it difficult to draw general conclusions about which, if any, models provide the best empirical fit to species <b>abundance</b> <b>distributions.</b> I compiled data from the literature to significantly expand the available data for underrepresented taxonomic groups, and combined this with other macroecological datasets to perform comprehensive model comparisons for the species <b>abundance</b> <b>distribution.</b> A multiple model comparison showed that most available models for the species <b>abundance</b> <b>distribution</b> fit the data equivalently well across a diverse array of ecosystems and taxonomic groups. In addition, a targeted comparison of the species <b>abundance</b> <b>distribution</b> predicted by a major ecological theory, the unified neutral theory of biodiversity (neutral theory), against a non-neutral model of species abundance, demonstrates that it is difficult to distinguish between these two classes of theory based on patterns in the species <b>abundance</b> <b>distribution.</b> In concert, these studies call into question the potential for using the species <b>abundance</b> <b>distribution</b> to infer the processes operating in ecological systems...|$|R
