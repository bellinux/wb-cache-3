5|$|Metformin has an oral {{bioavailability}} of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and {{is absorbed}} slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within {{one to three}} hours of taking immediate-release metformin and four to eight hours with extended-release formulations. The <b>plasma</b> <b>protein</b> binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000l after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached {{in one or two}} days.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid has low <b>plasma</b> <b>protein</b> binding (approximately 31%, {{but highly}} variable) and an {{apparent}} volume of distribution at steady state of around 40–50liters. Peak serum concentrations (Cmax) are reached {{one to two}} hours after administration of the drug. Linezolid is readily distributed to all tissues in the body apart from bone matrix and white adipose tissue. Notably, the concentration of linezolid in the epithelial lining fluid of the lower respiratory tract is at least equal to, and often higher than, that achieved in serum (some authors have reported bronchial fluid concentrations up to four times higher than serum concentrations), which may account for its efficacy in treating pneumonia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations vary; peak CSF concentrations are lower than serum ones, due to slow diffusion across the blood–brain barrier, and trough concentrations in the CSF are higher for the same reason. The average half-life is three hours in children, four hours in teenagers, and five hours in adults.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, gastric decontamination {{is unlikely to}} be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, gastric lavage or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning. The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations. Ipecac-induced vomiting is not recommended. As activated charcoal does not adsorb glycols, it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption. It is only used {{in the presence of a}} toxic dose of another poison or drug. Patients with significant poisoning often present in a critical condition. In this situation stabilization of the patient including airway management with intubation should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination. Patients presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with sodium bicarbonate and anticonvulsives such as a benzodiazepine respectively. Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen hypocalcemia by increasing the <b>plasma</b> <b>protein</b> binding of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage. Intubation and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with hypotension require treatment with intravenous fluids and possibly vasopressors.|$|E
40|$|A {{new system}} is {{described}} {{for studying the}} control of protein synthesis. In a monolayer culture of chick embryo liver cells, <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins</b> are synthesized for three days at in vivo rates. The <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins</b> are secreted into the culture medium and without concentration are detected there simply and sensitively by a modified Laurell electronimmunoassay. Secretion of the newly synthesized <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins</b> occurs within 30 min of their synthesis. Thus, rates of synthesis of the <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins</b> can be followed readily from rates of their accumulation in the culture medium. This system has the following advantages {{for the study of}} protein synthesis: cells {{do not have to be}} disrupted for the assay; the cell population can be followed over several days; it is not necessary to label the proteins radioactively; and turnover of <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins</b> is negligible and need not be taken into account. The usefulness of the system is illustrated by a number of findings. The spectrum of <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins</b> synthesized in culture changed qualitatively and quantitatively. Albumin synthesis steadily decreased with culture time and stopped at the third day, whereas the synthesis of some new <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins</b> ("adult") was induced. These qualitative changes suggest differential gene expression in culture and a special control of albumin synthesis in vivo, different from the synthesis of the other <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins.</b> Quantitative changes in the rates of synthesis of specific <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins</b> suggest a competition among their messenger RNAs for components of the translational machinery.

Alpha1 acid glycoprotein is the most variable of these proteins inter-individually, especially in cancer patients and is therefore the main determinant of docetaxel's plasma binding variability.

40|$|Advances in {{quantitative}} proteomics have {{facilitated the}} measurement of large-scale protein quantification, which represents net changes in protein synthesis and breakdown. However, measuring the rate of protein synthesis {{is the only way}} to determine the translational rate of gene transcripts. Here, we report a technique to measure the rate of incorporation of amino acids from ingested protein labeled with stable isotope into individual <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins.</b> This approach involves three steps: 1) production of stable isotope-labeled milk whey protein, oral administration of this intrinsically labeled protein, and subsequent collection of blood samples; 2) fractionation of the plasma and separation of the individual <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins</b> by a combination of anion exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography and gel electrophoresis; and 3) identification of individual <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins</b> by tandem mass spectrometry and measurement of stable isotopic enrichment of these proteins by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Other investigators have found <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins</b> in brain parenchyma and suggested that blood-brain barrier dysfunction might be a primary factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's dementia. These studies were performed on formol-fixed brains of patients with Alzheimer's dementia. In the present study we investigated both frozen and formol-fixed brain tissues. The influence of post-mortem delay, prolonged formol fixation and differences in clinical course on detection of <b>plasma</b> <b>proteins</b> by immunocytochemical techniques was also studied.

25|$|Drowsiness, dissociation, and psychosis-like effects (e.g., hallucinations, delirium) are {{reported}} in patients treated with ketamine starting at circulating concentrations of around 50 to 200ng/mL (210–841nM), while analgesia begins at levels of approximately 100 to 200ng/mL (421–841nM). The typical intravenous antidepressant dosage of ketamine used to treat depression is low and results in maximal plasma concentrations of 70 to 200ng/mL (294–841nM). Circulating concentrations of around 2,000 to 3,000ng/mL (8,413–12,620nM) are employed during anesthesia, and patients may start to awaken once levels of ketamine have decreased to about 500 to 1,000ng/mL (2,103–4,207nM).

Using a nasal pool-device, the nasal mucosa of 10 allergic individuals, without current disease, was sequentially exposed to saline and histamine (40 and 400 microg ml(- 1)). Nasal lavage fluid and blood-levels of albumin (69 kD) and alpha 2 -macroglobulin (720 kD) were determined. Histamine produced concentration-dependent exudation of albumin and alpha 2 -macroglobulin.
