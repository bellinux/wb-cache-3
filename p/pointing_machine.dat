500|$|The student {{sculptures of}} both Moore and Hepworth {{followed}} the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism {{and the influence}} of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a [...] "pointing machine", a technique called [...] "pointing". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the <b>pointing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|From 1911-14 he was {{employed}} at the workshop of La Maison Greber, learning traditional techniques of reproducing sculpture in stone with pointing machines known as [...] "mise aux point". [...] In 1915, he eschewed the purely classical methods of sculpture {{which consisted of}} copying from plaster models and enlarging with a <b>pointing</b> <b>machine.</b> [...] He began using the technique of [...] "taille directe", or direct carving. [...] He referred to this method of carving as “pure sculpture.” [...] Inspired by modernism, de Creeft destroyed all his previous casts, molds, and clay pieces. [...] When he had destroyed all but two pieces, his friend Julio de Diego came to visit him. [...] They took the remaining two sculptures outside to the traffic circle surrounding the Arc de Triomphe and placed bets on which car would hit which sculpture.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pointing</b> <b>machine</b> is {{used for}} making {{one-to-one}} copies of existing sculptures and to reproduce models made of plaster, modeling clay or modeling wax in materials like stone or wood. It {{is not possible to}} use a <b>pointing</b> <b>machine</b> to produce enlarged or reduced copies; the traditional instruments for this are a set of calipers or a three-dimensional version of the pantograph. However, there is also a special version of the <b>pointing</b> <b>machine</b> that was used for mirroring, enlargements or reduced carving.|$|E

40|$|<b>Point</b> <b>machines</b> {{are the key}} {{actuator}} used in railways {{to provide}} a means of moving a switch blade from one position to the other. Failure in the point actuator has {{a significant effect on}} train operations. Condition monitoring systems for <b>point</b> <b>machines</b> have been therefore implemented in some railways, but these condition monitoring systems have limitations for detecting incipient faults. Furthermore, the majority of condition monitoring systems which are currently in use cannot diagnose faults. The ability to diagnose faults is useful to maintenance staff who need to fix problems immediately. This thesis proposes a methodology to detect and diagnose incipient faults using an advanced algorithm. In the main body of this thesis the author considers a new approach using Wavelet Transforms and Support vector machines for fault detection and diagnosis for railway electrical AC <b>point</b> <b>machines</b> operated in Japan. The approach is further enhanced with more data sets collected from railway electrical DC <b>point</b> <b>machines</b> operated in Great Britain. Furthermore, a method to express the qualitative features of healthy and faulty waveforms was proposed to test the transferability of the specific algorithm parameters from one instance of a <b>point</b> <b>machine</b> to another, which is tested on railway electrical DC <b>point</b> <b>machines</b> used in Great Britain. Finally, an approach based on Wavelet Transforms and Neural networks is used to predict the drive force when the <b>point</b> <b>machine</b> is operating. The approach was tested using electrical DC <b>point</b> <b>machines</b> operated in Great Britain. It is shown through the use of laboratory experimentation that the proposed methods have potential to be used in a real railway system...|$|R

40|$|A <b>point</b> <b>machine’s</b> gap is an {{important}} indication of its healthy status. An edge detection algorithm is proposed to measure and calculate a <b>point</b> <b>machine’s</b> gap from the gap image captured by CCD plane arrays. This algorithm integrates adaptive wavelet-based image denoising, locally adaptive image binarization, and mathematical morphology technologies. The adaptive wavelet-based image denoising obtains not only an optimal denoising threshold, but also unblurred edges. Locally adaptive image binarization {{has the advantage of}} overcoming the local intensity variation in gap images. Mathematical morphology may suppress speckle spots caused by reflective metal surfaces in <b>point</b> <b>machines.</b> The subjective and objective evaluations of the proposed method are presented by using <b>point</b> <b>machine</b> gap images from a railway corporation in China.

50|$|In visual art, copying {{the works}} of the masters is a {{standard}} way that students learn to paint and sculpt. In sculpture, copies have often been made using devices such as the <b>pointing</b> <b>machine,</b> the pantograph or, more recently, computer guided router systems that scan a model and can produce it in a variety of materials and in any desired size. Another way of copying three-dimensional works is by lost-wax casting and other forms of molding and casting.|$|E
50|$|Sculptures can be carved via {{either the}} direct or the {{indirect}} carving method. Indirect carving {{is a way}} of carving by using an accurate clay, wax or plaster model, which is then copied {{with the use of a}} compass or proportional dividers or a <b>pointing</b> <b>machine.</b> The direct carving method {{is a way of}} carving in a more intuitive way, without first making an elaborate model. Sometimes a sketch on paper or a rough clay draft is made.|$|E
50|$|To {{transfer}} {{measuring points}} from {{a model to}} a block of stone or wood, the sculptor usually takes three reference points on both model and block. By using these points a sculpture can be measured accurately, for the three directions of measuring - width, height and depth - are thus defined. These three measuring points are traditionally used by sculptors to copy a sculpture with calipers, but this was simplified significantly with {{the invention of the}} <b>pointing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E

40|$|A Bayes <b>Point</b> <b>machine</b> is {{a binary}} {{classifier}} that approximates the Bayes-optimal classifier by estimating {{the mean of}} the posterior distribution of classifier parameters. Past Bayes <b>Point</b> <b>machines</b> have overcome the intractability of this goal by using message passing techniques that approximate the posterior of the classifier parameters as a Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we investigate alternative message passing approaches that do not rely on Gaussian approximation. To make this possible, we introduce a new computational shortcut based on linear multiplechoice knapsack problems that reduces the complexity of approximating Bayes Point belief propagation messages from exponential to linear in the number of data features.

50|$|Master carvers {{then used}} the durable plaster {{cast as a}} {{measuring}} tool, covering {{the surface of the}} plaster cast with hundreds of pencil marks and metal pins, or points, which served as registration marks for a <b>pointing</b> <b>machine.</b> The <b>pointing</b> <b>machine</b> was moved repeatedly from the points on the plaster cast to corresponding areas on a block of marble to guide the carver's tools as he translated the composition into marble. The tool would then be moved, over and over again, hundreds of times, from the points on the plaster to the corresponding locations on the block of marble. Each time, the tool would measure the depth and location on the marble block, creating a three-dimensional guide that helped the marble carver replicate the artist's original form more quickly and with greater ease. When creating the finished marble versions, fine details including the cross and locket, and the chains were finalised, and differ slightly between the different marble versions. The Smithsonian American Art Museum holds the original 1843 pointed-plaster mold that served as the model for the marble versions of the Greek Slave, along with numerous other smaller casts from Powers' studio.|$|E
50|$|To {{better control}} {{the end result}} of the {{finished}} sculpture, sculptors have increasingly taken to making a detailed model and then reproducing it, on the same scale or enlarged, in stone. Particularly in the 19th century, sculptors would follow a specific procedure: first a wax or clay model was made, of which a plaster cast was taken, which in its turn served as the model to be copied in stone with the use of calipers or a <b>pointing</b> <b>machine.</b> This is called the indirect method of carving.|$|E
50|$|In {{using the}} <b>pointing</b> <b>machine,</b> the {{sculptor}} mounts or glues three metal rivets, {{that correspond to}} each other, on both model and block of stone or wood. To these basic points, a (usually wooden) T-shaped support is hooked up, the cross. On this crosswood, the actual pointing device is attached. The sculptor sets the device by moving {{the arms of the}} tool so that the point of the needle just touches the point to be measured on the model (for instance, the nose of a bust). The needle is set at a right angle to the surface that is measured and the stop is tightened.The sculptor then takes the whole cross, <b>pointing</b> <b>machine</b> and all, to the block of stone or wood and sets it up on the identical, corresponding basic points. The needle that defines the measuring point can slide. By subsequently carving or drilling carefully until the needle touches the stop, the sculptor can place their measuring point exactly in the block.By thus copying several dozens or hundreds of points, an accurate copy can be carved. The quality of the copy will still depend on the skill of the sculptor, however, because these points are only the basis for the final sculpture.|$|E

40|$|We mount eight {{pressure}} sensors {{on a computer}} mouse and collect mouse pressure signals from subjects who fill out web forms containing usability bugs. This approach {{is based on a}} hypothesis that subjects tend to apply excess pressure to the mouse after encountering frustrating events. We then train a Bayes <b>Point</b> <b>Machine</b> in an attempt to classify two regions of each user's behavior: mouse pressure where the form-filling process is proceeding smoothly, and mouse pressure following a usability bug. Di#erent from current popular classifiers such as the Support Vector <b>Machine,</b> the Bayes <b>Point</b> <b>Machine</b> is a new classification technique rooted in the Bayesian theory.

40|$|Support Vector Machines {{choose the}} {{hypothesis}} {{corresponding to the}} centre of the largest possible hypersphere which can be inscribed in version space.

50|$|The work {{begins with}} the {{selection}} of a stone for carving. The artist may carve in the direct way, by carving without a model. Or the sculptor may begin with a clearly defined model to be copied in stone. Frequently the sculptor would begin by forming a model in clay or wax, and then copying this in stone by measuring with calipers or a <b>pointing</b> <b>machine.</b> Some artists use the stone itself as inspiration; the Renaissance artist Michelangelo claimed that his job was to free the human form trapped inside the block.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes a {{blank block}} of plaster itself was carved to produce {{mock-ups}} or first drafts of sculptures (usually relief sculptures) that would ultimately be sculpted in stone, by measuring exactly from the cast, for example {{by using a}} <b>pointing</b> <b>machine.</b> These are still described as plaster casts. Examples of these by John Flaxman {{may be found in}} the central rotunda of the library at University College London, and elsewhere in the University's collections. It may also describe a finished original sculpture made out of plaster, though these are rarer.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} {{of this method}} are that {{the end result is}} very controllable and that the chance of making irreparable mistakes is reduced drastically. In addition, the process is much faster when carving difficult sculptures, because the search for the right shape is done during the modelling process instead of during the carving itself, thus making it much easier to adjust it or make changes. Finally, using this method, much or all of the work can be done by assistant sculptors, increasing productivity. The dis{{advantages of}} using the <b>pointing</b> <b>machine</b> are a great loss of directness and the risk of loss of expression.|$|E
