40|$|SUMMARY Zinc {{absorption}} {{was measured}} in 37 children with malnutrition using the oral zinc tolerance test (22 - 5 mg elementary zinc) and the results {{compared with those of}} a group of healthy control subjects. The increase in plasma zinc was significantly lower in patients with marasmic kwashiorkor than in the control group. The zinc tolerance test was, however, normal in marasmic patients. We conclude that zinc deficiency occurs in some types of <b>protein</b> energy <b>malnutrition,</b> and that malabsorption may aggravate zinc deficiency. It is reasonable to give higher doses of zinc than are usually recommended during oral zinc supplementation in patients with <b>protein</b> energy <b>malnutrition.</b> <b>Protein</b> energy <b>malnutrition</b> is still an important problem {{in many parts of the}} world.

25|$|Hookworm {{infection}} {{is generally considered}} to be asymptomatic, but as Norman Stoll described in 1962, hookworm {{infection is}} an extremely dangerous infection because its damage is “silent and insidious.” There are general symptoms that an individual may experience soon after infection. Ground-itch, which is an allergic reaction at the site of parasitic penetration and entry, is common in patients infected with N. americanus. Additionally, cough and pneumonitis may result as the larvae begin to break into the alveoli and travel up the trachea. Then once the larvae reach the small intestine of the host and begin to mature, the infected individual will suffer from diarrhea and other gastrointestinal discomfort. However, the “silent and insidious” symptoms referred to by Stoll are related to chronic, heavy-intensity hookworm infections. Major morbidity associated with hookworm infection is caused by intestinal blood loss, iron deficiency anemia, and <b>protein</b> <b>malnutrition.</b> They result mainly from adult hookworms in the small intestine ingesting blood, rupturing erythrocytes, and degrading hemoglobin in the host. This long-term blood loss can manifest itself physically through facial and peripheral edema; eosinophilia and pica caused by iron deficiency anemia are also experienced by some hookworm-infected patients. Recently, more attention has been given to other important outcomes of hookworm infection that play a large role in public health. It is now widely accepted that children who suffer from chronic hookworm infection can suffer from growth retardation as well as intellectual and cognitive impairments. Additionally, recent research has focused on the potential of adverse maternal-fetal outcomes when the mother is infected with hookworm during pregnancy.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Protein</b> energy <b>malnutrition</b> is {{commonly}} associated with immune dysfunctions and {{is a major factor}} in susceptibility to infectious diseases. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the impact of <b>protein</b> energy <b>malnutrition</b> on the capacity of monocytes and macrophages to upregulate arginase, an enzyme associated with immunosuppression and increased pathogen replication. RESULTS: Our results show that monocytes and macrophages are significantly increased in the bone marrow and blood of mice fed on a protein low diet. No alteration in the capacity of bone marrow derived macrophages isolated from malnourished mice to phagocytose particles, to produce the microbicidal molecule nitric oxide and to kill intracellular Leishmania parasites was detected. However, macrophages and monocytes from malnourished mice express significantly more arginase both in vitro and in vivo. Using an experimental model of visceral leishmaniasis, we show that following <b>protein</b> energy <b>malnutrition,</b> the increased parasite burden measured in the spleen of these mice coincided with increased arginase activity and that macrophages provide a more permissive environment for parasite growth. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results identify a novel mechanism in <b>protein</b> energy <b>malnutrition</b> that might contributes to increased susceptibility to infectious diseases by upregulating arginase activity in myeloid cells...|$|R

We found a positive correlation between bone age and arm fat area in control boys and between bone age and height for age in boys with <b>protein</b> energy <b>malnutrition.</b> The finding that rehabilitated children were shorter than the control group but had similar bone age at follow up suggests that genetic or prenatal factors were important in their later poor growth, and this suggestion is supported by their smaller birth size and the smaller size of their mothers...|$|R
