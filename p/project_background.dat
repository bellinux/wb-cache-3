It is rational way of make the specific project above others emphasizing the attention of participation of most active candidate of a team. It is because someone important within the company wants to see it. The result should be that the resources and equipment are made available to you to ensure your project happens.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Our paper {{proposes a}} vision-based hand gesture {{recognition}} system. It is implemented in a camera-projector system {{to achieve an}} augmented reality tool. In this configuration the main {{problem is that the}} hand surface reflects the <b>projected</b> <b>background,</b> thus we apply a robust hand segmentation method. Hand localizing is based on a background subtraction method, which adapts to the changes of the <b>projected</b> <b>background.</b> Hand poses are described by a method based on modified Fourier descriptors, which involves distance metric for the nearest neighbor classification. The proposed classification method is compared to other feature extraction methods. We also conducted tests on several users. Finally, the recognition efficiency is improved by the recognition probabilities of the consecutive detected gestures by maximum likelihood approach. ...|$|R
50|$|The film makes {{extensive}} use of the Introvision process, a variation of front projection that allows realistic three-dimensional interaction of foreground characters with <b>projected</b> <b>backgrounds</b> without the heavy cost of traditional bluescreen effects. The technique was also used in the films Outland, Megaforce, Army of Darkness and Andrew Davis' later film, The Fugitive.|$|R
5000|$|Humans are {{estimated}} to have approximately 20,000 protein-coding genes, which account for about 1.5% of DNA in the human genome. The primary goal of the ENCODE project {{is to determine the}} role of the remaining component of the genome, much of which was traditionally regarded as [...] "junk." [...] The activity and expression of protein-coding genes can be modulated by the regulome - a variety of DNA elements, such as the promoter, transcriptional regulatory sequences, and regions of chromatin structure and histone modification. It is thought that changes in the regulation of gene activity can disrupt protein production and cell processes and result in disease (ENCODE <b>Project</b> <b>Background).</b> Determining the location of these regulatory elements and how they influence gene transcription could reveal links between variations in the expression of certain genes and the development of disease.|$|E
50|$|CoMET {{services}} {{applied to}} evaluate the actual composition of a site’s subsurface {{are part of a}} complete geotechnical engineering service. For purposes of short-term economy, however, some owners select a firm not associated with the geotechnical engineer of record to provide these and all other CoMET services. This approach precludes the geotechnical engineer of record from providing a complete service. It also aggravates risk, because the individuals engaged to evaluate actual subsurface conditions are not “briefed” by the geotechnical engineer of record before they go to the project site and seldom communicate with the geotechnical engineer of record when they discern differences, in large part because the firm associated with the geotechnical engineer of record is regarded as a competitor of the firm employing the field representatives. In some cases, the field representatives in question lack the specific <b>project</b> <b>background</b> information and/or the education and training required to discern those differences.|$|E

50|$|The film is infamous among Basques for its misunderstandings of Basque customs, {{such as the}} use of the xistera (a {{device of}} the jai alai sport) as a weapon or {{shouting}} irrintzi ululations as meaningful communication.Other commentators, though, have noted the well staged action scenes, the absorbing story, and the excellent cinematography.

50|$|Many effects set-ups {{consisted}} of miniature Kong models being animated frame-by-frame {{in front of}} a rear-screen <b>projected</b> <b>background</b> plate—of either still or live-action elements. As time progressed during animation—when using moving footage as a background—animators might neglect to advance the projected image (on the rear screen) to the next frame as they concentrated on Kong's movements, spoiling the illusion that the animated model and the plate coexisted in reality, requiring time-consuming (and expensive) re-takes.|$|R
