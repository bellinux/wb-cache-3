5|$|The bowl {{earned the}} right to select these teams via its multimillion-dollar <b>payout</b> system, which {{guarantees}} {{a certain amount of money}} to the participating conferences. Before 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl (then known as the Peach Bowl) matched the No.5 team in the SEC versus the No.3 team in the ACC. After the bowl increased its <b>payout</b> to $2.8million per squad, it then was given the second pick from the ACC, with the Gator Bowl dropping to third. After 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl has steadily increased its payouts in order to keep pace with the trend across college football. In the 2009 game, the ACC and SEC split a <b>payout</b> of $6.02 million, with the ACC receiving more because it offered an earlier selection.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the investor reaction to {{information on the}} final value of dividend <b>payouts</b> for companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, using the event study methodology. Our research shows that investor reaction is positive for irregular <b>payouts</b> and both the initiation of {{and the increase in}} <b>payouts,</b> while negative for the resumption and of and decreases in <b>payouts.</b> The magnitude of the reaction is also higher for the initiation of <b>payouts</b> than either the increases in, or irregular <b>payouts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{literature}} {{has estimated that}} the 2003 dividend tax cut caused a large increase in aggregate dividend <b>payouts,</b> which would imply that dividend taxation creates large efficiency costs relative {{to the amount of}} revenue raised. I document that dividend <b>payouts</b> by real estate investment trusts also rose sharply following the tax cut, even though REIT dividends did not qualify for the cut. Using REITs as a control group in a simple difference-in-differences framework produces small and statistically insignificant estimates of the effect of the tax cut on aggregate dividend <b>payouts.</b> I further document that the ratio of dividend <b>payouts</b> to corporate earnings changed little after the tax cut, and that the ratio of dividend <b>payouts</b> to share repurchases fell dramatically. These facts suggest that contemporaneous increases in earnings and investor demand for <b>payouts</b> drove the observed increases in aggregate dividend <b>payouts,</b> with at most a modest role for the tax cut.

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 17, 544 firms from 28 {{countries}} we explore how creditors influence dividend <b>payouts</b> in various disclosure regimes. Poorly-protected creditors do not restrict the practice by firms in opaque regimes of using large dividend <b>payouts</b> to build reputation capital, and place few restrictions on dividend <b>payouts</b> in transparent regimes. In intermediate disclosure regimes creditors place large restrictions on dividend <b>payouts.</b> Dividend <b>payouts</b> are always largest in transparent regimes. Our findings say that the disclosure standards versions of the outcome and substitution agency models of dividends are not mutually-exclusive, and are as effective under weak as they are under strong creditor rights...|$|R
5|$|The 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl was a postseason college {{football}} match between the Georgia Bulldogs and the Virginia Tech Hokies at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. The University of Georgia represented the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and Virginia Tech represented the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in the competition. The game {{was the final}} competition of the 2006 football season for each team and resulted in a 31–24 Georgia victory, even though spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by three points. In exchange {{for the right to}} pick the first ACC team after the Bowl Championship Series selections, bowl representatives paid US$3.25million to the ACC, while the SEC, whose fifth team was selected, received $2.4million. The combined $5.65million <b>payout</b> was the seventh-largest among all {{college football}} bowl games, and the fourth-largest non-BCS bowl game <b>payout.</b>|$|E
5|$|A row {{broke out}} on 1 March 2007 when it emerged that the Government were paying {{compensation}} {{to the company}} for the 159,000 culled turkeys while laid-off workers were receiving nothing. At £3.75 each for hens and £3.53 for toms, the <b>payout</b> was then estimated at between £537,000 and £570,000. In the event, though, the actual compensation bill came out at £589,356.89. The crisis cost Bernard Matthews at least £20m in lost sales and costs.|$|E
5|$|By 1882, {{a romance}} had sprung up between Margaret and lodger Thomas Higgins. The pair married in October of that year.

30|$|The {{disbursement}} of SSS <b>payouts</b> is fuss-free for recipients, as the Singapore {{government has}} been giving out ad hoc or regular cash transfers to Singaporeans since (at least) 2008, and thus has efficient systems in place {{that can be used}} to disburse new types of cash transfers. The government credits the <b>payouts</b> to bank accounts that most Singaporeans have already registered with the government. Those who do not have a registered bank account will receive a cheque that is mailed to their registered residential address. If the cheque is not encashed or banked in within 6  months, the government will credit the <b>payouts</b> into the individuals’ defined contribution accounts, which are withdrawable within a year. The set-up for determining eligibility and disbursing <b>payouts</b> suggests that Singaporeans who are eligible for the SSS <b>payouts</b> will almost certainly receive their <b>payouts.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{document}} {{a significant}} {{inverse relationship between}} a firm’s dividend <b>payouts</b> and reliance on bank loan financing. Banks limit dividend <b>payouts</b> to shareholders {{in order to protect}} the integrity of their senior claims on the firm’s assets. Moreover, dividend <b>payouts</b> decline in the presence of monitoring by relationship banks, which acts as an effective governance mechanism, thereby reducing the gains from pre-committing to costly dividend <b>payouts.</b> Bank monitoring and corporate governance (insider stake and institutional block holdings) are complementary mechanisms to resolve firm agency problems, both reducing the firm’s reliance on dividend policy. ...|$|R

The results confirm that the UEFA <b>payouts</b> have a statistically significant effect at the league-level depending on which competitive balance measure and league sample is used. However, the UEFA <b>payouts</b> had no statistically significant effect on individual clubs’ average annual payroll or the clubs’ qualification for the Champions League in the following season...|$|R
5|$|Due to {{revenue-sharing}} agreements among Big East schools, Virginia Tech's selection by the Gator Bowl {{resulted in}} a payment of $1.7 million less than {{if it had been}} selected by a BCS bowl game.

5|$|In {{choosing}} the SEC opponent, the Chick-fil-A Bowl selection committee {{had the right}} to select the first SEC school after the Bowl Championship Series, Cotton Bowl Classic, Capital One Bowl, and Outback Bowl made their selections. Just as in the ACC, the selection committee could not select an SEC team with two more losses than the highest available team. The bowl earned the right to select these teams via its multimillion-dollar <b>payout</b> system, which guarantees {{a certain amount of money}} to the participating conferences. Prior to 2006, the Chick-fil-A Bowl (then known as the Peach Bowl) matched the No.5 team in the SEC versus the No.3 team in the ACC. After the bowl increased its <b>payout</b> to $2.8million per squad, it then was given the second pick from the ACC, with the Gator Bowl dropping to third.|$|E

40|$|We study whether more asymmetrically timely {{earnings}} constrain <b>payouts</b> {{to shareholders}} {{in the presence}} of bad news. Our goal is to provide evidence on the ex post contracting benefits of accounting conservatism. We distinguish between cash flow asymmetric timeliness and accrual asymmetric timeliness to examine how each relates to asymmetric sensitivity of shareholder <b>payouts.</b> We find that only the asymmetric timeliness of cash flows is significantly related to the asymmetric sensitivity of shareholder <b>payouts.</b> Other measures of conservatism (earnings skewness and accumulated nonoperating accruals) are also not significantly related to the sensitivity of shareholder <b>payouts</b> given bad news. These results suggest that accounting policies do not significantly constrain shareholder distributions conditional on news that does not affect cash flows...|$|R

5|$|Thanks to its {{appearance}} in the Orange Bowl and a revenue-sharing agreement with other Big East schools, Virginia Tech earned $3.981 million for playing in the 1996 Orange Bowl. $3.5 million of that total came directly from the bowl, while the remaining $481,000 came from the revenue-sharing pool generated by all the Big East teams that participated in bowl games.
