In Australian waters, this ray has been assessed as of Least Concern. Although it is caught (and discarded) by prawn trawlers, this mortality has been reduced by the mandatory installation of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs). Furthermore, a portion of its Australian range lies within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

The study aims at identifying farmer’s decision {{rules and the}} socio-economic determinants of organic resource dynamics. Decision rules study and socio-economic determinants of organic resource dynamics allowed quantification of their impact on these organic resource dynamics. The main results of the investigations reveal that principal decision rules are edicted and managed by local authorities. These decision rules concern collective management {{and access to the}} cultivated land, grazing land, and homestead and to the bush. Farmers have also a diversity of individual rules covering production, consumption, marketing and relations between themselves. Survey of a sample of one hundred farmers selected for their representativity allowed to quantify relations between farm needs and their organic resource use. These relations permitted developing empirical statistical models (needs of land to cultivate, food grains needs, cash needs, fuel wood needs) depending on farming system. Fuel wood needs were established with survey measured data. These needs expressed in kilogramme consumed wood <b>per</b> <b>day</b> <b>per</b> <b>person</b> were established for the dry season (0. 97 kg <b>per</b> <b>person</b> and <b>per</b> <b>day)</b> and for the wet season (1. 36 kg <b>per</b> <b>person</b> and <b>per</b> <b>day).</b> Average fuel wood consumption <b>per</b> <b>person</b> and <b>per</b> <b>day</b> has an exponential decay when the household size increases. When land is available, land need for cultivation mainly depends on labour availability. Food grain needs is constant (180 kg <b>per</b> <b>person</b> and <b>per</b> year).

Of the 1051 responses to the survey, drawn randomly from households between Bundaberg and Cairns, 87 % indicated they had taken a trip to one beach (“most preferred beach”), 73 % undertook {{a trip to a}} second beach (“second most preferred beach”), 30 % undertook a trip to an island, and 42 % undertook a fishing/boating/sailing trip over the last two years. Probit models were used to represent the choice to take a recreation activity, while count data models (zero truncated negative binomial models) were used to model the zero truncated positive integer count data. Average values <b>per</b> <b>person</b> <b>per</b> trip <b>per</b> <b>day</b> were estimated at $ 35 for beaches, $ 331 for Islands, and $ 183 for fishing, boating and sailing activities (although the value for the latter group is not significant). Additional information about how variation within population groups may affect the demand for recreation activities has been gained by trailing the use of quantile regression models to estimate recreation values as well as the more standard count data models. The results are likely to represent the lower value of recreation activities because travel time and location investment costs have not been included in the analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn {{order to}} assess the impact of an {{anthropogenic}} climate change on the transmission of malaria, an integrated assessment model has been developed. In this integrated model, the direct effects of a change in temperature and precipitation on the transmission potential of a mosquito population are assessed by means of the vectorial capacity (defined as the number of potentially infective contacts inflicted by the mosquito population <b>per</b> infectious <b>person</b> <b>per</b> <b>day)</b> and the related critical mosquito density (the minimum number of mosquitoes needed to maintain malaria at an endemic level). The simulation results indicate a worldwide increase of potential malaria risk and an extension of the areas conductive to malaria transmission. In non-malarious areas the risk of introduction of malaria associated with imported cases of malaria increases to some extent as a result of the increasing importance of modern transport systems (e. g. air travel) in introducing malaria into receptive areas. However, sound interpretation of the change in malaria risk as simulated must be performed within the framework of local conditions and socio-economic developments...|$|R

The relationship between the deprivation area and antibiotic use (items <b>per</b> 1000 <b>persons</b> <b>per</b> <b>day)</b> was stratified according to the patient's age and sex and the antibiotic class dispensed. A multivariate Poisson regression model was used to formally test the associations.   Approximately 12 million prescription items during 2010 - 2012 were assessed.

Three scenarios were defined: using microalgal biofilms: (1) as a post-treatment; (2) as a second stage of wastewater treatment, after a first stage in which COD is removed by activated sludge; and (3) in a symbiotic microalgal/heterotrophic system.
