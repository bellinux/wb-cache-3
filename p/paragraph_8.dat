The canon is till the reign of Artaxerxes as mentioned by Josephus above in Against Apion (Book 1, <b>Paragraph</b> <b>8).</b> For a long time, following this date, the divine inspiration of Esther, the Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes was often under scrutiny. According to Gerald A.

The territory claimed by Russia in the submission is {{a large portion of the}} Arctic within its sector, extending to but not beyond the geographic North Pole. One of the arguments was a statement that Lomonosov Ridge, an underwater mountain ridge passing near the Pole, and Mendeleev Ridge on the Russian side of the Pole are extensions of the Eurasian continent.

I want to elaborate two general points {{about the nature of}} argument quality and argument evaluation. First, like Tindale, I believe that argument analysis and evaluation must take into account the audience in the argumentation process and must acknowledge that arguments are characteristically (if not always) less than certain demonstra-tions of the claims they support. The construction of arguments is a bilateral process, whether thought of rhetorically in the roles of a speaker and an audience or dialectically in the roles of two interlocutors. And it is most useful to think of those arguments as stronger or weaker, as more or less convincing, rather than as certain or worthless. But {{it seems to me that}} two straightforward implications of these ideas is that the stance from which an audience (or critic) receives an argu...|$|R

For the purposes of the present discussion I wish to identify three seminal themes in Newbigin's papers as orientation points for my own reflections. Since these themes are further elaborated in Newbigin's major book, The Gospel in a Pluralist Society, I will refer to this work as well. (References to the latter work will be identified with the abbreviation, GPS). [2] I. Newbigin asserts that modern secular ideology, rooted {{in the spirit of the}} Enlightenment, affirms the myth of the neutrality of the public domain. Religion (and religious freedom) is deemed to belong to the private sphere. Religious choice and the expression of religious views can be tolerated as long as they do not impinge directly on (i. e., seek to control) what happens in the public square. (See "What Kind [...] ., " <b>paragraphs</b> <b>8</b> and 20; "Can a Modern [...] ., " pp. 1 and 2). [3] It is indisputable that this secular worldview has had an immense impact on education. While modern secular society leaves room for certain religiously-motivated educational choices in the private domain, formal education (schooling) is deemed to be something which must advance the public interest. Since religion is a matter of private opinion, it cannot be allowed to control wha...|$|R

5000|$|NSAM-273 {{consists}} of 10 <b>paragraphs</b> of which <b>8</b> are identical with the Bundy draft of 21 November. Paragraph 4 and 7 had been changed. Paragraph 4 is more emphatic than Bundy's draft. It exhorts [...] "unity {{of support for}} established U.S. policy in South Vietnam" [...] and places [...] "particular importance" [...] on avoiding criticism of other U.S. government officials and agencies. This was an attempt by Johnson to stifle policy disputes in Washington among his chief advisers and in Saigon between Ambassador Lodge and General Harkins. The changes in Paragraph 7 of Bundy's draft are related to prosecution of the war. Bundy had said {{that there should be}} a detailed plan by South Vietnam for taking action against North Vietnam. NSAM-273 as adopted is more specific, detailing the purposes of planning -- but not confining such planning to action by South Vietnam, implying that the U.S. would assist and participate in covert action in North Vietnam. [...] The strengthening of this paragraph seems to have been at the behest of the U.S. military which believed that many of South Vietnam's problems originated in North Vietnam and that action should be taken against the North. The most discussed part of NSAM 273 is Paragraph 2 which affirmed the withdrawal called for in NSAM 263. stating [...] "The objectives of the United States with respect to the withdrawal of U. S. military personnel remain as stated in the White House statement of October 2, 1963." [...] (The White House statement of 2 October, among other things, declared the intention to withdraw 1,000 soldiers from Vietnam by end of the 1963. Paragraph 5 reflects that long-standing U.S. opinion that the military and pacification efforts of South Vietnam should be focused on the Mekong Delta where the situation is [...] "critical." [...] Paragraph 6 says that aid to the new South Vietnamese government should be maintained at least at levels provided to the previous Diem government. <b>Paragraphs</b> <b>8</b> and 9 deal with U.S. plans in neighboring Laos and Cambodia.
