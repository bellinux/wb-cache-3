25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of computer networks, {{there has been a}} persistent need for client systems which can boot appropriate software images, with appropriate configuration parameters, both retrieved at boot time from one or more network servers. This goal requires a client to use a set of pre-boot services, based on industry standard network protocols. Additionally, the Network Bootstrap Program (NBP) which is initially downloaded and run must be built using a client firmware layer (at the device to be bootstrapped via PXE) providing a hardware independent standardized way to interact with the surrounding network booting environment. In this case the availability and subjection to standards are a key factor required to guarantee the network boot <b>process</b> <b>system</b> interoperability.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>process</b> <b>system</b> is a {{specialized}} system of processes. [...] Processes {{are composed of}} processes. [...] Complex processes {{are made up of}} several processes that are in turn made up of several processes. [...] This results in an overall structural hierarchy of abstraction. [...] If the <b>process</b> <b>system</b> is studied hierarchically, it is easier to understand and manage; therefore, process architecture requires the ability to consider process systems hierarchically. Graphical modeling of process architectures is considered by dualistic Petri nets. Mathematical consideration of process architectures may be found in CCS and the π-calculus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of a <b>process</b> <b>system,</b> or its architecture, {{can be viewed as}} a dualistic relationship of its infrastructure and suprastructure. [...] The infrastructure describes a process system's component parts and their interactions. [...] The suprastructure considers the super system of which the <b>process</b> <b>system</b> is a part. [...] (Suprastructure should not be confused with superstructure, which is actually part of the infrastructure built for (external) support.) [...] As one traverses the process architecture from one level of abstraction to the next, infrastructure becomes the basis for suprastructure and vice versa as one looks within a system or without.|$|E

Explosion at Sonatrach LNG {{liquefaction}} facility. 27 killed, 56 injured, three LNG trains destroyed, {{a marine}} berth was damaged and 2004 production was down 76 {{percent for the}} year. Total loss was US$900 million. A steam boiler {{that was part of}} an LNG liquefaction train exploded triggering a massive hydrocarbon gas explosion. The explosion occurred where propane and ethane refrigeration storage were located. Site distribution of the units caused a domino effect of explosions. It remains unclear if LNG or LNG vapour, or other hydrocarbon gases forming part of the liquefaction process initiated the explosions. One report, of the US Government Team Site Inspection of the Sonatrach Skikda LNG Plant in Skikda, Algeria, March 12–16, 2004, has cited it was a leak of hydrocarbons from the refrigerant (liquefaction) <b>process</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{complementary}} observable {{aspect of}} the first law is about heat transfer. Adynamic transfer of energy as heat can be measured empirically by changes in the surroundings {{of the system of}} interest by calorimetry. This again requires the existence of adiabatic enclosure of the entire <b>process,</b> <b>system</b> and surroundings, though the separating wall between the surroundings and the system is thermally conductive or radiatively permeable, not adiabatic. A calorimeter can rely on measurement of sensible heat, which requires the existence of thermometers and measurement of temperature change in bodies of known sensible heat capacity under specified conditions; or it can rely on the measurement of latent heat, through measurement of masses of material that change phase, at temperatures fixed by the occurrence of phase changes under specified conditions in bodies of known latent heat of phase change. The calorimeter can be calibrated by adiabatically doing externally determined work on it. The most accurate method is by passing an electric current from outside through a resistance inside the calorimeter. The calibration allows comparison of calorimetric measurement of quantity of heat transferred with quantity of energy transferred as work. According to one textbook, [...] "The most common device for measuring [...] is an adiabatic bomb calorimeter." [...] According to another textbook, [...] "Calorimetry is widely used in present day laboratories." [...] According to one opinion, [...] "Most thermodynamic data come from calorimetry..." [...] According to another opinion, [...] "The most common method of measuring [...] "heat" [...] is with a calorimeter." ...|$|E

50|$|A modular process skid is a <b>process</b> <b>system</b> {{contained}} within a frame {{that allows the}} <b>process</b> <b>system</b> to be easily transported. Individual skids can contain complete process systems and multiple process skids can be combined to create larger process systems or entire portable plants. They are sometimes called “a system in a box.” An example of a multi-skid <b>process</b> <b>system</b> might include a raw materials skid, a utilities skid and a processing unit which work in tandem.|$|E
50|$|Skid process systems {{provide a}} plethora of {{advantages}} to traditional stick built construction process systems. The main advantage is quality control. Because only one party {{will be responsible for}} the construction and build of the skid process unit, there is a higher level of responsibility and quality control. With stick build methods of construction, there are many different levels of building before the final process unit is complete, making it difficult to determine which party is responsible for an error. Skid process systems are fully tested before being sent out; therefore they are ready to be used immediately upon delivery. Lastly, the skid <b>process</b> <b>system</b> allows for efficient use of space. A skid <b>process</b> <b>system</b> fits into a set frame; meaning space is efficiently used to house all of the parts of the <b>process</b> <b>system,</b> and the skid <b>process</b> <b>system</b> can be moved to another location if it ever becomes necessary.|$|E

To design a complex <b>process</b> <b>system,</b> such as a sophisticated hardware component or a major project, the process architect must first define the problem space. Since the problem space is itself a <b>process</b> <b>system,</b> dPNs can be used for its modeling. Abstract dPNs that are yet to be implemented are specified {{within the context of the}} problem space. These constructs define the solution space within its context network. It is now up to the process architect to traverse down the hierarchical abstraction dimension, proposing new process designs for the solution space in an iterative manner until specifying the actual implementation in the specific implementation language.|$|E
