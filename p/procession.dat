5|$|All the {{criminal}} proceedings against him were canceled and {{the charges of}} blasphemy were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn <b>procession</b> to Eleusis (for {{the celebration of the}} Eleusinian Mysteries) by land {{for the first time since}} the Spartans had occupied Decelea. The <b>procession</b> had been replaced by a journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional <b>procession.</b> His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of land and sea (strategos autokrator).|$|E
5|$|His triumph {{included}} a long <b>procession</b> of captives including {{the wife of}} Arminius, Thusnelda, and her three-year-old son, among others of the defeated German tribes. The <b>procession</b> displayed replicas of mountains, rivers, and battles; and the war was considered closed.|$|E
50|$|Records also {{indicate}} that relics were employed during outdoor penitential <b>processions.</b> These include Rogation Day <b>processions</b> designed to promote the fertility of the land by blessing them. They also appeared in <b>processions</b> designed to ward off a particular threat; for instance, at his council at Bath, King Æthelred ordered <b>processions</b> involving relics to counter the Viking threat.|$|R
50|$|Guilds {{from many}} {{different}} professions would {{take part in the}} <b>processions</b> that took place {{over the course of the}} festival. Artisan <b>processions</b> were not introduced into these festivals until 1582 and with the incorporation of an elaborate guild structure emerging in the seventeenth century, it became even more entrenched. The next two <b>processions</b> after that were limited strictly to guilds participating in <b>processions.</b> All the guilds that participated and created their own <b>processions</b> were depicted through miniatures in the Surname. A variety of guilds and groups were depicted in the Surnames.|$|R
50|$|In early 1950s too {{district}} administration kept refusing Madhe-Sahaba <b>processions</b> and counter <b>processions</b> and courts upheld such stands.|$|R
5|$|The most {{important}} festival to Athena in Athens was the Lesser Panathenaea, held annually, which {{was open to}} both sexes. Men and women were apparently not segregated during the <b>procession</b> leading the animals sacrificed to the altar, the festival's most religiously-significant part. Metics, both men and women, also had role in the Panathenaic <b>procession,</b> though it was subordinate {{to the role of}} the Athenians. In the <b>procession,</b> young noble girls (kanephoroi) carried sacred baskets. The girls were required to be virgins; to prevent a candidate from being selected was, according to Pomeroy, to question her good name. The sister of Harmodius was reportedly rejected as a kanephoros by the sons of Peisistratos, precipitating his assassination of Hipparchus.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} {{tradition}} (started in 1987) is Dunster by Candlelight {{which takes place}} every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns its back on the present and lights its streets with candles. To {{mark the beginning of}} the festival on Friday at 5 pm, there is the Lantern Lighting <b>Procession</b> that starts on the Steep and continues through the village until all the lanterns in the streets have been lit. The <b>procession</b> of children and their families is accompanied by colourful stilt walkers in costumes who put up the lanterns.|$|E
5|$|Ahmedabad observes a {{wide range}} of festivals. Popular {{celebrations}} and observances include Uttarayan, an annual kite-flying day on 14 and 15 January. Nine nights of Navratri are celebrated with people performing Garba, the most popular folk dance of Gujarat, at venues across the city. The festival of lights, Deepavali, is celebrated with the lighting of lamps in every house, decorating the floors with rangoli, and the lighting of firecrackers. The annual Rath Yatra <b>procession</b> on the Ashadh-sud-bij date of the Hindu calendar at the Jagannath Temple and the <b>procession</b> of Tajia during the Muslim holy month of Muharram are important events.|$|E
40|$|This report works its {{way from}} anthropological and sociological {{theories}} on <b>processions</b> and rituals, and uses literature to explain and illustrate rituals and <b>processions</b> within Hinduism. Through examples, it is understood how complex and diverse Hindu rituals and <b>processions</b> are. The report narrows down on two case studies, one where field work was conducted through personal interviews and participant and observatory work on the Jaipur Elephant Festival, India, the other a historical analysis {{of a series of}} Hindu-political <b>processions</b> during the 90 s throughout India. The cases emphasize the different meanings and consequences of <b>processions</b> and rituals, where one proves to be an invented tradition, where the other proves to be advocating violence, while identity creation in both cases is an important aspect of the <b>processions...</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{account of}} its {{location}} and size the Graben was particularly suitable for festival <b>processions.</b> Fronleichnamsprozessionen (<b>processions</b> {{on the occasion}} of the Feast of Corpus Christi) are first mentioned in 1438, but probably took place even earlier. With the arrival of Protestantism, these <b>processions</b> played a particularly important role in the demonstration of Catholic faith. During the era of Emperor Charles VI, daily masses were held at the Pestsäule. In the 18th century <b>processions</b> took place nearly every week, but this was curtailed by Empress Maria Theresa. Finally, Emperor Joseph II forbade all <b>processions</b> save the Corpus Christi.|$|R

5|$|At State {{funerals}} the heralds {{once again}} {{take their place}} {{at the front of}} the royal <b>procession</b> as it enters the place of worship. Historically during the <b>procession</b> of royal funerals (usually of the Sovereign) the heralds would carry a piece of armour, representing the various marks of chivalry. These included the helm and crest, spurs, gauntlet, target (shield of arms), sword and a literal 'coat of arms' (a heraldic surcoat). This <b>procession</b> of chivalry was an integral part of the heraldic royal funeral. One of the most solemn role for the heralds during a royal funeral is the reading of the full list of the styles and titles of the deceased. On 9 April 2002, Garter King of Arms Peter Gwynn-Jones read out the full styles and 437 titles of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother at the end of her funeral service at Westminster Abbey.|$|E

40|$|Egyptian <b>processions</b> were performed, and {{acquired}} meaning, {{in a religious}} context. Funeral <b>processions,</b> for example, symbolized the deceased’s transition into the hereafter. The most important <b>processions,</b> however, were the <b>processions</b> of deities that {{took place during the}} major feasts, especially those feasts that recurred annually. The deity left his or her sanctuary on these occasions and thus provided the only opportunities for a wider public to have more or less immediate contact with the deity’s image, although in most cases it still remained hidden within a shrine. These <b>processions</b> often involved the journey of the principal deity of the town to visit other gods, not uncommonly “deceased” ancestor gods who were buried within the temple’s vicinity. The “wedding” of a god and his divine consort provided yet another occasion for a feast for which <b>processions</b> were performed...|$|R
5|$|Bethlehem celebrates festivals {{related to}} saints and prophets {{associated}} with Palestinian folklore. One such festival is the annual Feast of Saint George (al-Khadr) on 5–6 May. During the celebrations, Greek Orthodox Christians {{from the city}} march in <b>procession</b> to {{the nearby town of}} al-Khader to baptize newborns in the waters around the Monastery of St. George and sacrifice a sheep in ritual.

5|$|Devotees {{visit the}} temple {{to attend the}} daily pujas and make their offerings. Booths are erected outside {{for the sale of}} food, drink, brassware, pottery, cloth and holy images. On the {{penultimate}} day of the festival there is a <b>procession,</b> when the image of the goddess is placed upon a huge wooden chariot and pulled around the temple by devotees. On {{the final day of the}} festival, two large chariots are drawn by the devotees to the Deduru oya, a local river for the thirtham ("holy bath") ceremony when the images are dipped into the river. At the same time thousands of devotees also jump into the river. After the holy bath, the <b>procession</b> goes back to the temple along a route through Chilaw, accompanied by traditional Nadeswaram and Thavil musicians. The <b>procession</b> then passes the Ayyanayake and Kali temples prior to entering the main temple.|$|E

5000|$|Baldinucci’s preaching was simple, {{vivid and}} dramatic. He {{organized}} <b>processions</b> which would start from various {{areas of the}} country to the place where he was holding the mission. Many of the people in these <b>processions</b> would wear crowns of thorns and scourge themselves. Given the size of these <b>processions,</b> Baldinucci often employed a number of laymen (whom he called deputati) to help manage the crowd. Many of these [...] "deputati" [...] were drawn from the people he thought might otherwise be tempted to disrupt the <b>processions.</b>|$|R

5|$|In the 18thcentury it was {{the custom}} for the wealthy in Poulton to bury their dead at night, {{following}} a lamp-lit <b>procession</b> through town. This tradition lasted until 1810. In 1732, during the <b>procession</b> preceding the funeral of Geoffrey Hornby, strong winds caused sparks to fly from the lighted tapers carried by mourners. The buildings {{on the west side}} of the market place, low cottages with thatched roofs, caught fire and were destroyed. After local fund-raising the houses were eventually replaced with brick buildings with tile roofs.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the standard-bearer of the Mrkojevići clan, a Muslim, walked next to {{the cross}} with a flag in his left and a knife in his right hand, ready to use it if anyone {{attempted}} to take the cross. The clan especially feared that the participants from Krajina might try to recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in the <b>procession</b> dropped as their religious and political leaders disapproved of their participation in it. After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and the <b>procession</b> was not held between 1959 and 1984.|$|E
