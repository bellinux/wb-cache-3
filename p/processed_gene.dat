40|$|Like many {{clinical}} diagnostic laboratories, we undertake routine {{investigation of}} cancer-predisposed individuals by high-throughput sequencing of patient DNA {{that has been}} target-enriched for genes associated with hereditary cancer. Accurate diagnosis using such reagents requires alertness against rare nonpathogenic variants that may interfere with variant calling. In a cohort of 2042 such cases, we identified five that initially appeared to be carriers of a 95 -bp deletion of SMAD 4 intron 6. More detailed analysis indicated that these individuals all carried one copy of a SMAD 4 <b>processed</b> <b>gene.</b> Because of its interference with diagnostic analysis, we characterized this <b>processed</b> <b>gene</b> in detail. Whole genome sequencing and confirmatory Sanger sequencing of junction PCR products were used to show that {{in each of the}} five cases, the SMAD 4 <b>processed</b> <b>gene</b> was integrated at the same position on chromosome 9, located within the last intron of the SCAI gene. This rare polymorphic <b>processed</b> <b>gene</b> therefore reflects the occurrence of a single ancestral retrotransposition event. Compared to the reference SMAD 4 mRNA sequence NM_ 005359. 5 ([URL] the 5 ′ and 3 ′ UTR regions of the <b>processed</b> <b>gene</b> are both truncated, but its open reading frame is unaltered. Our experience leads us to advocate the use of an RNA-seq aligner, as part of diagnostic assay quality assurance, since this allows their recognition in a comparatively facile automated fashion...|$|E
40|$|We show herein the {{transcription}} of a <b>processed</b> <b>gene</b> that originated from a spliced transcript. Recently, we isolated {{the human and}} murine homologues of the yeast chromatin protein, SPT 4. The Supt 4 h gene is spliced normally from five exons encoded by chromosome 11. Here we show that a related sequence on chromosome 10 encodes Supt 4 h 2, a processed intronless gene (with a polyA tail and a tandemly-duplicated 13 bp insertion site in the genome) with a different 5 ' control region. Both the spliced gene, Supt 4 h, and the <b>processed</b> <b>gene,</b> Supt 4 h 2, are expressed in each of four tissues we examined. Supt 4 h 2 encodes a 117 amino acid protein nearly identical to the Supt 4 h gene product with only one amino acid difference, indicating extreme conservation of this expressed <b>processed</b> <b>gene</b> with the spliced gene over evolutionary time.

40|$|To {{solve the}} Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) with {{different}} varieties and small batches, a modified meta-heuristic algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed in which gene encoding {{is divided into}} process encoding and machine encoding, {{and according to the}} encoding mode, the machine gene fragment is connected with the <b>process</b> <b>gene</b> fragment and can be changed with the alteration of <b>process</b> <b>genes.</b> In order to get the global optimal solutions, the crossover and mutation operation of the <b>process</b> <b>gene</b> fragment and machine gene fragment are carried out respectively.

Meanwhile, a judgment condition of the crossover point quantity is introduced to speed up the population evolution and as an important interaction bridge between the current machine and alternative machines in the incidence matrix, a novel mutation operation of machine genes is proposed to achieve the replacement of manufacturing machines. The benchmark test shows the correctness of proposed algorithm and the case simulation proves the proposed algorithm has better performance compared with existing algorithms...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{modeling}} overlapping biological processes.

A key feature of our approach is that we allow genes to participate in multiple processes, thus providing a more biologically plausible model for the <b>process</b> of <b>gene</b> regulation. We present algorithms to learn each model automatically from data, using only genomewide measurements of gene expression as input. We compare our results to those obtained by other approaches and show that significant benefits can be gained by modeling both the organization of genes into overlapping cellular processes and the regulatory programs of these processes. Moreover, our method successfully grouped genes known to function together, recovered many regulatory relationships that are known in the literature, and suggested novel hypotheses regarding the regulatory role of previously uncharacterized proteins.

Most prior work on gene retrocopy discovery compared copies in reference genome assemblies to their source genes. Here, we explore gene retrocopy insertion polymorphisms (GRIPs) that are present in the germlines of individual humans, mice, and chimpanzees, and we identify novel gene retrocopy insertions in cancerous somatic tissues that are absent from patient-matched non-cancer genomes. Results: Through analysis of whole-genome sequence data, we found evidence for 48 GRIPs in the genomes of one or more humans sequenced as part of the 1, 000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas, but which were not in the human reference assembly. Similarly, we found evidence for 755 GRIPs at distinct locations in one or more of 17 inbred mouse strains but which were not in the mouse reference assembly, and 19 GRIPs across a cohort of 10 chimpanzee genomes, which were not in the chimpanzee reference genome assembly.
