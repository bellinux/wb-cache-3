50|$|The {{numerous}} small railway {{companies in}} the area would eventually combine. The Aberdeen Railway operated in a loose arrangement with the SMJR and the SCR, with a common <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>locomotives</b> and rolling stock, but in 1856 that arrangement came to an end, when the Aberdeen Railway and the Scottish Midland Junction Railway merged to form the Scottish North Eastern Railway. For the time being the Scottish Central Railway went its own way. The A&FR lease transferred to the SNER. The new company concentrated its traffic from Aberdeen to the south via Forfar, and the line into Arbroath fell into disuse. Its track was lifted in 1857.|$|R
50|$|The {{maintenance}} facility {{worked in}} tandem with the Joncherolles depot at Villetaneuse to maintain the steam locomotives on the suburban network serving Paris-Nord. In the final years of steam service, a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> 141 TC <b>locomotives</b> were used, with two locomotives specifically assigned one each to Joncherolles and the other to Beaumont. In 1968, the <b>pool</b> <b>locomotives</b> <b>of</b> the two depots pulled 264 daily trains for a monthly service distance of between 240,000 and 265,000 km. In 1967, they covered 2,838,000 km.|$|R
5000|$|Since the Illinois Central {{purchase}} in 1998 CN {{has been}} increasingly focused on running a [...] "scheduled freight railroad/railway." [...] This {{has resulted in}} improved shipper relations, as well as reduced the need for maintaining <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> surplus <b>locomotives</b> and freight cars. CN has also undertaken a rationalization of its existing track network by removing double track sections in some areas and extending passing sidings in other areas.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were initially}} {{selected from the}} Classes 33-400, 35-000 and 35-200, but by December 1989 some Class 33-000 locomotives also began to serve one or more tours of duty in Zambia.

5000|$|EWS usually used Class 37s in pairs, for freight workings. Additionally EWS {{used the}} Class 37s on railtours or charter hire to train {{operating}} companies. For example, in 2005 Arriva Trains wales used 37/4 haulage on the Rhymney valley line, from a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> four <b>locomotives,</b> these locomotives being 37405 (EWS livery), 37425 (BR Large Logo), 37411 (BR green livery), 37419 (EW&S livery), This loco replaced 37408 [...] "Loch Rannoch" [...] which {{was involved in}} a collision with parked stock at Rhymney sidings, which was suspected to be caused by vandals. 37408 suffered from severe extensive damage and was written off at Toton TMD with its power unit removed and used to revive 37422. Its body was later scrapped at European Metal Recycling, Kingsbury, Warwickshire.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> Class 35-000 <b>locomotives</b> {{allocated}} by the Railways {{for hire}} to ZR included the locomotives annotated [...] "Zambia" [...] in the [...] "allocation" [...] {{column in the}} table. The first Class 35-000 units to serve in Zambia were on hire by May 1980. They served there {{for less than a}} year, being employed on road work as well as shunting. By the end of March 1981 the last Class 35-000 unit to remain there was no. 35-064 which was due to return to South Africa as soon as the last of ZR’s new Krupp-built diesel locomotives, no. 0-210, was delivered.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1985 {{twelve of}} the {{remaining}} Class 25/3 locomotives were designated as 25/9, the intention being that they would operate on traffic won for the Industrial Minerals Division of Railfreight that included salt for road gritting from the ICI mine at Winsford. The locos were selected from the available <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> Class 25 <b>locomotives</b> in March 1985 with the expectation of three more years of service before 10,000 running hours since last Works attention would be reached and their maintenance would be concentrated at Carlisle Kingmoor depot. At that point the expected cascade of motive power on BR as a whole would see them replaced by Class 31 locomotives. However, the traffic they were designated for was not captured and in due course the sub-class were withdrawn {{along with the other}} members.|$|R
50|$|Today {{the line}} is served by Arriva CrossCountry (Deutsche Bahn) Voyager {{services}} from Aberdeen to Penzance and their Class 170 Nottingham to Cardiff Central service, together with the London Midland Hereford to Birmingham New Street Class 170 local passenger service. The line is also a major freight route, featuring in particular, a weekday rolled steel slab train from the North East, routed via Gloucester to South Wales, where the steel slab is further rolled and coiled, returning the following day, for finishing into various manufacturers sheet requirements. On the return journey, these freight trains, as all loaded freight trains on the route, require banking assistance on the infamous Lickey Incline, a service which is undertaken by the freight company EWS (now DB Cargo), with one <b>of</b> their dedicated <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> Class 66 <b>locomotives,</b> dutifully waiting on call at Bromsgrove.|$|R
