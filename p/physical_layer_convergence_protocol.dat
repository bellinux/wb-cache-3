The OFDM <b>physical</b> <b>layer</b> specifies PPDU (PLCP protocol data unit) frame format that consists of PLCP (<b>Physical</b> <b>Layer</b> <b>Convergence</b> Procedure) preamble, the PLCP header, PSDU, Tail bits and Pad bits. The PLCP preamble is the major component for synchronization, and it consists of 10 "Short" OFDM symbols and 2 "Long" OFDM symbols. This project focuses on researching robust synchronization methods for 802. 1 la OFDM systems using the PLCP "Short" and "Long" training symbols. Monte Carol simulations are applied to evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed methods of synchronization in AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel and indoor residential channel using JTC (Joint Technical Committee) wireless channel model...|$|R
30|$|Other {{possible}} PHY optimizations are preamble {{and data}} switching. They are explained {{in detail in}} [22]. In short, preamble switching occurs when a new frame arrives {{at the time that}} the receiver node is still receiving the preamble and <b>physical</b> <b>layer</b> <b>convergence</b> procedure (PCLP) header of an earlier frame. The new frame can be picked and locked onto by the receiver node if it has sufficiently higher power to be heard above the earlier one. Data switching refers to the capture of a new incoming frame during the frame body reception process of another one. The result of applying these techniques on top of SDDV level 7 is depicted in part (c) of Figure 13. It can be observed that in the CAM PSR plot, a darker red area has appeared around the diagonal. This means that the CAM PSR for a node’s most direct neighbors has reached very high values. This is a desirable VANET communication characteristic. Therefore, we define the adoption of preamble and data switching as the last key characteristic of SDDV (level 8).|$|R
30|$|The frame {{structure}} has the PLCP {{protocol data unit}} (PPDU) that consists of <b>physical</b> <b>layer</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>protocol</b> (PLCP) preamble, PLCP header, and PHY service data unit. The PLCP preamble has two distinct parts: a unique synchronization sequence and a channel estimation sequence. It helps the receiver in timing synchronization, carrier-offset recovery, and channel estimation. In our proposed MU-synchronization, TX 0 with 0 shift starts to transmit a PPDU first based on its local timer and the other nodes, i.e. TX 1, TX 2, RX 0, RX 1, and RX 2, start {{to listen to the}} synchronization sequence of TX 0 for the synchronization with their local timers. The transmitters, TX 1 and TX 2, start to transmit their PPDUs with their shifted TFCs after the synchronization. Then, the TX-RX pairs can communicate synchronously.|$|E
30|$|IEEE 802.11 ac {{is also in}} {{the process}} of {{collecting}} specific proposals and its ratification for MU-MIMO inclusion. In particular, the recently available amendment [18] has proposed some modifications on <b>physical</b> <b>layer</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>protocol</b> (PLCP) header and control packets format. PLCP header will indicate the mode of transmission (SU-MIMO or MU-MIMO) while control packet will indicate the group of receivers selected for MU-MIMO transmission by assigning common group identity. As major modification is required at the MAC layer to smooth operating rules in widen channels during variable network condition, IEEE 802.11 ac is on the process to modify the control packets format on {{such a way that it}} could indicate traffic types, packet length, supported bandwidth, and padding sequences. The very high throughput (VHT) control field will be present in a control wrapper frame and explicit sounding and compressed matrix feedback will be used.|$|E
40|$|Wireless mobile ad hoc {{stations}} have limited battery capacity. Hence, ad hoc routing protocols {{ought to be}} energy conservative. However, The simulation studies carried out for table-driven and on-demand ad hoc routing protocols fall short of examining essential power-based performance metrics, such as average node and network lifetime, energy-based protocol fairness, average dissipated energy per protocol, and standard deviation of the energy dissipated by each individual node. In this paper, we present a thorough energy-based performance study of poweraware routing protocols for wireless mobile ad hoc networks. Our energy consumption model {{is based on a}} detailed implementation of the IEEE 802. 11 <b>physical</b> <b>layer</b> <b>convergence</b> <b>protocol</b> (PLCP) and medium access control (MAC) sublayers.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of current Internet usage is data retrieval and information exchange. As a result, the focus has been shifted from the current location-based system to an Information-Centric system, where information can be cached and accessed from anywhere within the network {{rather than from the}} end hosts only. To support this functionality, data must be uniquely identified regardless of the location. Current research efforts in the area of Information-Centric Networks presume the existence of a <b>Convergence</b> <b>Layer</b> <b>protocol</b> that facilitates the functionalities of forwarding, while data caching takes place on a higher-plane. Therefore, this paper proposes a <b>convergence</b> <b>layer</b> <b>protocol,</b> based on the Location/ID Separation Protocol which uses two numbering spaces for data.

Therefore, it does not address issues like routing or congestion control. It was originally designed to support “long-haul” transmission in an interplanetary network; its design is based on experiences with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP).

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} closed-loop, dynamic rate {{adaptation}} algorithm {{that can be}} implemented in all IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g compliant wireless local area networks. Our proposed algorithm is a culmination of the best attributes of the transmitter-based Auto-Rate Fall-back (ARF) and the Receiver-based Auto-Rate (RBAR) control mechanisms with additional practical features to facilitate multipath fading channel sensing and feedback control signalling. Unlike ARF, our technique supports real-time feedback information beyond frame acknowledgments {{through the use of}} reserved bits in the SERVICE field of the <b>Physical</b> <b>Layer</b> <b>Convergence</b> <b>Protocol</b> (PLCP) header. Unlike RBAR, no modification of the medium-access control (MAC) frame format is necessary for feedback control since the initial channel state information is conveyed via these same reserved bits. Our proposed scheme is transparent in the sense that devices using our technique can co-exist with other 802. 11 -compliant devices in the same basic service area. By combining RTS/CTS handshake with data fragmentation, we differentiate data loss (and reduction in goodput) due to MAC collision from data corruption due to bad physical channel state and poor rate selection. The goodput gains of our approach, when compared to ARF and RBAR, are measured via simulation for various traffic load conditions in stationary and non-stationary multipath fading channel models.

To date, little {{work has been done}} in evaluating the effectiveness and performance of the available DTN protocols when they are applied to an interplanetary Internet, especially in presence of a long link disruption. In this paper, we present an experimental investigation of the DTN architecture with a Bundle Protocol (BP) running over TCP-based <b>convergence</b> <b>layer</b> (TCPCL) <b>protocol</b> in a simulated cislunar communication environment characterized by a long link disruption. The intent of this work is to investigate the effectiveness of the TCPCL-based DTN protocol in coping with long link disruptions, through realistic file transfer experiments using a PC-based test-bed. The experiment results show that the DTN protocol is effective in handling a long link disruption experienced in data transmission accompanied by a cislunar link delay and a high BER. The performance of the DTN is most adversely affected by link disruption time in comparison to the effect of link delay and BER. For the transmissions with a very long link disruption of hours, the variations in goodput are nominal with respect to the change in cislunar link delay. </p...|$|R
