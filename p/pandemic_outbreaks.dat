40|$|<b>Pandemic</b> <b>outbreaks</b> are {{unpredictable}} as {{to their}} virus strain, transmissibility, and impact on our quality of life. Hence, the decision support models for mitigation of <b>pandemic</b> <b>outbreaks</b> must be user-friendly and operational, and also incorporate valid estimates of disease transmissibility and severity. This dissertation research is aimed at 1) reviewing the existing pandemic simulation models to identify their implementation gaps with regard to usability and operability, and suggesting research remedies, 2) increasing operability of simulation models by calibrating them via an epidemiological model that estimates infection probabilities using viral shedding profiles of concurrent pandemic and seasonal influenza, and 3) developing a testing strategy for the state laboratories, with their limited capacities, to improve their ability to estimate evolving transmissibility parameters. Our review of literature (Aim 1) indicates the need to continue model enhancements in critical areas including updating of epidemiological data during a pandemic, smooth handling of large demographical databases, incorporation of a broader spectrum of social-behavioral aspects, and improvement of computational efficiency and accessibility. As regards the ease of calibration (Aim 2), we demonstrate that the simulation models, when driven by the infection probabilities obtained from our epidemiological model, accurately reproduce the disease transmissibility parameters. Assuming the availability of sufficient disease reporting infrastructure and strong compliance by both infected population and healthcare providers, our testing strategy (Aim 3) adequately supports characterization of real-time epidemiological parameters. Future research on this topic will be aimed at integrating the laboratory testing strategy with our modeling and simulation approach to develop dynamic mitigation strategies for <b>pandemic</b> <b>outbreaks...</b>|$|E

40|$|SummaryTransmission of avian {{influenza}} virus into human populations {{has the potential}} to cause <b>pandemic</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> A major determinant of species tropism is the identity of amino acid 627 in the PB 2 subunit of the heterotrimeric influenza polymerase; glutamic acid predominates in avian PB 2, whereas lysine occupies this position in human isolates. We show that a dominant inhibitory activity in human cells potently and selectively restricts the function of polymerases containing an avian-like PB 2 with glutamic acid at residue 627. Restricted polymerases fail to assemble into ribonucleoprotein complexes, resulting in decreased genome transcription, replication, and virus production without any significant effect on relative viral infectivity. Understanding the molecular basis of this species-specific restriction should provide strategies to prevent and treat {{avian influenza}} outbreaks in humans...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Preventive {{measures}} {{are essential to}} limit the spread of new viruses; their uptake is key to their success. However, the vaccination uptake in <b>pandemic</b> <b>outbreaks</b> is often low. We aim to elicit how disease and vaccination characteristics determine preferences {{of the general public}} for new pandemic vaccinations. METHODS: In an internet-based discrete choice experiment (DCE) a representative sample of 536 participants (49 % participation rate) from the Dutch population was asked for their preference for vaccination programs in hypothetical communicable disease outbreaks. We used scenarios based on two disease characteristics (susceptibility to and severity of the disease) and five vaccination program characteristics (effectiveness, safety, advice regarding vaccination, media attention, and out-of-pocket costs). The DCE design was based on a literature review, expert interviews and focus group discussions. A panel latent class logit model was used to estimate which trade-offs individuals were willing to make. RESULTS: All above mentioned characteristics proved to influence respondents' preferences for vaccination. Preference heterogeneity was substantial. Females who stated that they were never in favor of vaccination made different trade-offs than males who stated that they were (possibly) willing to get vaccinated. As expected, respondents preferred and were willing to pay more for more effective vaccines, especially if the outbreak was more serious (€ 6 -€ 39 for a 10 % more effective vaccine). Changes in effectiveness, out-of-pocket costs and in the body that advises the vaccine all substantially influenced the predicted uptake. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that various disease and vaccination program characteristics influence respondents' preferences for pandemic vaccination programs. Agencies responsible for preventive measures during pandemics can use the knowledge that out-of-pocket costs and the way advice is given affect vaccination uptake to improve their plans for future <b>pandemic</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> The preference heterogeneity shows that information regarding vaccination needs to be targeted differently depending on gender and willingness to get vaccinated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Pandemic {{diseases}} are extremely infectious disease outbreaks. Pandemic viruses can easily spread worldwide within months, or weeks, and to cause infections in all age groups. There {{is a need}} for appropriate control measures to hinder the spread of such infectious diseases. One of the most effective ways of controlling the spread of infectious diseases is early detection of its onset at pointsof-entry to decrease introduction and spread of the pandemic. Observation of spatial and non-spatial patterns of disease spread necessitates good analysis and visualization of data related to such <b>pandemic</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> In this project, modeling the available real-life data into time-and collocation based sequence of events to observe patterns for disease spread, has been done since it is the pre-requisite for the visualization of such data.

40|$|Public health {{officials}} are increasingly recognizing {{the need to}} develop disease-forecasting systems to respond to epidemic and <b>pandemic</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> For instance, simple epidemic models relying on a small number of parameters can {{play an important role in}} characterizing epidemic growth and generating short-term epidemic forecasts.

40|$|Background: To present {{preparedness}} planning for an influenza pandemic for two nursing subunits: nursing services {{in hospitals and}} schools of nursing in universities. Discussion: The preparedness plan is modeled on a modified Haddon matrix, a logical approach to identify measures appropriate for the pre-event, event, and postevent phases of an influenza pandemic. For the pre-event phase, {{the objective is to}} ensure preparedness for the potential <b>pandemic</b> <b>outbreak</b> through training, communication, surveillance, infection control, and vaccination. Once the <b>pandemic</b> <b>outbreak</b> is declared, the aim is to implement effective measures to ensure a rapid and appropriate response. For the postevent phase, the plan is focused on the restoration of core functions, vigilance for a second or possibly more waves of the pandemic, and psychosocial support to staff and students. Conclusion: Measures required to prepare for, respond to, and manage the consequences of influenza pandemic are identified. This planning indicates the need to balance a logical approach with contextual perspectives and the importance for nursing leaders to develop plans for subunits of larger entities. © 2006 Sigma Theta Tau International. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Background It remains {{important}} {{to develop the}} next generation of influenza vaccines that can provide protection against vaccine mismatched strains and to be prepared for potential <b>pandemic</b> <b>outbreaks.</b> To achieve this, the understanding of the immunological parameters that medi-ate such broad protection is crucial.

Results We demonstrate that the heterosubtypic protection against H 5 N 1 induced by MM adju-vanted vaccine is partially mediated by antibodies.

Here, we describe the difference in predicted RNA secondary structure stability that exists between avian, swine and human coding regions.
