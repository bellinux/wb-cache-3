The data for regional retention of labeled PMN and the A-V differences observed for unlabeled cells both fit the equation Y = A + Be-cx (where A + B = 100), which showed that PMN accumulate in the lung as blood flow is reduced. We conclude that a dynamic equilibrium exists between the circulating and marginating pools of leukocytes in the lung and that blood flow <b>primarily</b> <b>effects</b> <b>the</b> reentry of cells into the circulating pool so that the marginating pool of PMN within the lung accumulates cells when blood flow is reduced below 7 ml/min per g...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{successful}} use of vasopressin {{in the management}} of hypotension in association with severe right ventricular (RV) failure in two patients with advanced idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.

After the use of vaso-pressin in both patients, cardiovascular variables improved without untoward effect on RV function, and provided rescue therapy for systemic hypotension in this setting. Vasopressin, a direct vasopressor acting via V 1 receptors on the vascular endothelium, has been shown to cause pulmonary vasodilatation experimentally and in animal models of pulmonary hyper-tension. Its synthetic analogue, terlipressin, has been shown to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance in humans with cirrhosis.

Verapamil produced a 20 % decline in pulmonary vascular resistance and a 27 % decrease in mean pulmonary arterial pressure without significant changes in systemic vascular resistance. One patient who received verapamil 480 mg orally daily for three months showed sustained haemodynamic and clinical improvement. Concomitant with its beneficial <b>effects</b> on <b>the</b> <b>pulmonary</b> circulation, however, verapamil produced a pronounced decrease in right ventricular stroke work index (42 %) and increase in right ventricular filling pressure (50 %), indicating a direct depressant <b>effect</b> of <b>the</b> drug on right ventricular function.

In conclusion, although verapamil appears to exert preferential vasodilator <b>effects</b> on <b>the</b> <b>pulmonary</b> circulation, its negative inotropic effects may be particularly detrimental to patients with primary pulmonary hypertension who have pre-existing right ventricular dysfunction; hence, treatment with verapamil is not recommended in such cases...|$|R

40|$|Background. The acute {{administration}} of vasodilator drugs {{to patients with}} primary pulmonary hypertension has been advocated to identify those with reversible <b>pulmonary</b> vasoconstriction.

The purine nucleoside adenosine was infused into <b>the</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery in seven patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (baseline pulmonary vascular resis-tance [PVR], 442 - 1, 295 dyne/cm/sec- 5) to determine its effect on PVR.

Here we investigated <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of genetic deletion of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 on hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension in mice by measuring pulmonary hemodynamics and pulmonary vascular remodeling before and after 2 weeks of hypoxia. In wild-type mice, hypoxia increased right ventricular pressure and pulmonary vascular remodeling. These effects of hypoxia were attenuated in the tryptophan hydroxylase 1 –/–mice. Hypoxia increased right ventricular hypertrophy in both wild-type and tryptophan hydroxylase 1 –/–mice suggesting that in vivo peripheral serotonin has a differential <b>effect</b> on <b>the</b> <b>pulmonary</b> vasculature and right ventricular hypertrophy. Contractile responses to serotonin were increased in pulmonary arteries from tryptophan hydroxylase 1 –/–mice. Hypoxia increased serotonin-mediated contraction in vessels from the wild-type mice, but this was not further increased by hypoxia in the tryptophan hydroxylase 1 –/–mice. In conclusion, these results indicate that tryptophan hydroxylase 1 and peripheral serotonin play an essential role in the development of hypoxia-induced elevations in pulmonary pressures and hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling.

We decided to explore {{the possibility of a}} definitive RVAD in <b>the</b> <b>pulmonary</b> circulation in <b>the</b> situation of univentricular heart. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test in this situation if a pulsatile or non-pulsatile device had different effects on pulmonary vascular reactivity. Methods: A univentricular circulation was created into five pigs and their circulation was maintained with either or continuous flow by means of a roller pump or a pulsatile flow with a pneumatically driven assist device (Medos®). Insufflation pressure in the device was set at 150 mmHg or 300 mmHg. Adaptation of <b>the</b> <b>pulmonary</b> vasculature was evaluated by continuous pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring and its response to non-pharmacologic stimuli after 120 minutes support. Results: The PAP is more than 35 mm Hg when the insufflation pressure is 300 mm Hg but with 150 mm Hg, the PAP is 20 mm Hg. The continuous flow assistance shows the same results.

50|$|The {{symptoms}} {{of heart failure}} are largely determined by {{which side of the}} heart fails.
