40|$|Context: Little {{is known}} about Libyan {{disability}} and rehabilitation services. Objectives: To describe workforce characteristics of the only functioning disability rehabilitation service in 2012 Libya. This was the Benghazi Rehabilitation and Handicap Center. The focus of the case study was the physical disability services including amputee care. Method: Organizational case study involving site visit, self-report workforce survey, and review of relevant policy, government and peak agency reports relevant to disability services. Results: The case study revealed that disability regulations in Libya focussed on social security entitlements and impairment focussed treatment. Community based rehabilitation or initiatives for social inclusion and participation were scant, creating problems for people requiring long term rehabilitation in the community. The center workforce continued to function in spite of conflict and in difficult circumstances. While expatriate staff left in the 2011 conflict, local staff retention was high. These workers were mono-lingual, had longevity of tenure, {{and a lack of}} qualification mobility. Some such as therapists and <b>prosthetic</b> <b>technicians,</b> had highly specialised skills requiring center facilities. The case study revealed: escalating patient demand; bed-block; and problems in supplies, capital and equipment maintenance. There were opportunities to increase capacity through: clinical and administrative staff training; development of inpatient facilities for women; discharge options for long-term male inpatients; and coordinated information systems. Of 232 eligible, n= 72 staff, who participated in the survey (mean age was 39. 4 years; n= 40 males). Most therapists/ <b>prosthetic</b> <b>technicians</b> were male; most nurses/ administrative workers were female (p=. 0001).

40|$|International audienceRapid Manufacturing (RM) is an {{emerging}} {{technology that is}} set to revolutionise how products are manufactured. Past research has centred on processes, materials and costing, neglecting the vital issue of how the implementation of this new technology will affect the skills of workers. This work aims to evaluate how the skills of professionals {{working in the field}} of prosthetics are likely to be affected by the introduction of RM. Currently a highly skilled, manual process, this paper explores the hypothesis that the manufacture of prosthetic sockets would change fundamentally with the introduction of RM technology. This was evaluated through the use of the Job Characteristics Model, which assesses the skills change and job satisfaction implications of applying new technology to traditional manufacturing processes. Conclusions showed that RM would {{have a significant impact on}} job roles in the prosthetics industry. Analysis found a positive outlook for the prosthetist, with the new technology increasing computer-based skills, and traditional prosthetic skills continuing to be used. The <b>prosthetic</b> <b>technician</b> bears the major impact, deskilled by the, loss of many of the craft skills. However, the new role may appeal to the younger generation, and lowered skill requirements may help increase prosthetics services worldwide...|$|E
40|$|Para establecer consideraciones importantes sobre el dise?o de las pr?tesis dentales parciales removibles se presentan algunos criterios respecto a la {{necesidad}} de considerar lo que sucede en las articulaciones temporo-mandibulares (ATM), cuando el caso por resolver es unilateral o cuando es bilateral. Se debe recordar que el sistema estomatogn?tico cumple con 32 funciones dentro {{de las cuales}} las ligadas con la masticaci?n, la digesti?n oral y la fonoarticulaci?n cambian rotundamente si hay la carencia de los dientes posteriores. Pero esta carencia tambi?n compromete dos funciones generales de mucha importancia para la persona: el equilibrio y la alteraci?n auditiva. Por ello formular y confeccionar las pr?tesis dentales removibles no es algo tan simple que lo pueda hacer un simple dentista y menos un mec?nico dental sin la direcci?n de un profesional. Como la tarea es muy compleja, este es el primero de varios art?culos mediante los cuales se tratar? de reorientar el tratamiento rehabilitador del subsistema masticatorio como parte del sistema estomatogn?tico. Partial {{dental prosthesis}} {{is a very important}} field of dental rehabilitation process that usually is not well understood, mainly because it involves the repercussion on more than 10 of the 32 functions performed by the stomatognatic system. In order to fit several very important considerations about partial removable dental prosthesis design, some discernment about the need to consider factors that could affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) are presented, particularly when the lack of teeth is unilateral or bilateral. It is necessary to take on account that stomatognatic system performs the mastication, the oral carbohydrate digestion, the vocalization and other functions that could change drastically when there are no sufficient posterior teeth. But this lack also affects two general functions: the dynamic balance and the listening capability. All of those factors are very important to formulate and to produce high quality removable dental prosthesis; therefore, this kind of work couldn?t be performed by a simple dentist or by a dental <b>prosthetic</b> <b>technician</b> without a professional guidance. Since {{this is a very important}} and complex assignment, this paper is the first of a four assay being oriented to improve the rehabilitation treatment of the masticatory system as a part of the stomatognatic system...|$|E

40|$|Partial hand {{amputation}} {{is perhaps}} the most frequent amputation level, worldwide. Although its annual incidence in western countries is roughly 1 : 18000 inhabitants, the treatments of partial hand amputations have modestly progressed so far. We have identified three main limitation factors to this progress: (i) the wide range of anatomical and functional presentations which makes difficult to find standardized and scalable solutions, (ii) the technological complexity in replacing the motor and sensory function of a lost digit in the size of a digit and (iii) the fact that a partial hand can be functionally successful mostly when it restores a lost opposition movement, i. e. the ability to oppose the thumb against the fingers while providing enough grasping force and aperture width. This paper presents an overview of the existing surgical and technological solutions for treating partial hand amputations, and is specifically targeted to (biomedical) engineers. We critically highlighted the advantages, limitations and open challenges. Remarkably, current fitting procedures rely on manual approaches by skilled <b>prosthetic</b> <b>technicians</b> rather than on modern engineering methods. Hence the objective of this work is to comprehensively but concisely overview the field in order to inspire engineers to develop new systems and procedures able to address current open issues...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of fitting and making prosthetic limbs using current techniques leaves {{little room for}} innovative research and design. Though market leaders are consistently producing more advanced components, <b>prosthetic</b> <b>technicians</b> are using traditional techniques to fabricate prosthetic limbs. New material and design technologies could enable progressive solutions to historic barriers such as fabrication time and cost. Increasing the amputee’s accessibility to, and enjoyment of exercise may help to advocate and improve their physical and mental health. Design research was used to develop a functional 3 D printed swimming prosthesis for lower limb amputees {{with the use of}} 3 D scanning, parametric software and Fused Deposition Modelling. Using digital technologies has the potential to provide a platform for cost effective specialty prosthetic limbs, enabling and enriching recreational sport for amputees. Prototypes were developed with a unilateral trans-tibial amputee using an iterative process involving material testing and user testing. These prototypes allowed him to walk independently to the pool and produced positive effects on his swimming, including a recreated anthropometric symmetry. As advances in data collection and additive manufacturing continue to be made {{we will be able to}} more closely cater to the individual’s needs whilst challenging the status quo in prosthesis craft...|$|R
40|$|Prosthetic socket liners {{provide both}} {{suspension}} and stability, {{and they do}} so best when they cover the remaining limb without breaks in the liner surface. This full coverage conflicts {{with the need to}} acquire myoelectric signals directly from the skin. Early solutions to this problem include windows in the liner and metal electrodes piercing and thereby weakening the liner. Windows compromise the integrity of the liner and often lead to discomfort {{at the edge of the}} window. Metal electrodes require attachment of external wires after donning. Another alternative is to mount cased electrodes in molded silicone receptacles. This may result in a proper seal, but it requires repeated removal of the electrode from the liner. The problems identified above can be addressed by passing the myoelectric signals directly though the liner with flexible Conductive Inserts. This approach allows metal electrodes in the outer socket to acquire the myoelectric signals as if they were in direct contact with the skin with no wires attached to the liner. LTI has developed Conductive Inserts that not only pass myoelectric signals through the liner but also allow for misalignment when the liner is inserted into the socket. These Inserts can be installed by <b>prosthetic</b> <b>technicians</b> in a commercial liner, or they can be built into a custom liner. With Inserts installed, a liner is a separate part that can be easily removed for cleaning...|$|R
40|$|This thesis named: "Problems of {{usage of}} {{prosthetic}} aids for children" {{focuses on the}} nursing care specifics of the child patient after an amputation. The Amputation is defined as removal of the peripheral portion of the body with an interruption of a bone and the soft tissues which allows subsequent prosthetic solution. Prosthesis is externally applied aid, which replace missing or underdeveloped part of a limb eventually the whole limb. The aim of the Prosthetic centers is to offer to its clients the exact prosthetic solution which could fully replace the function of a missing limb and allow the child to live full life without any limitations. The intention of the thesis was to summarize the problematic of {{the upper and lower}} limbs amputation into one publication and also to focus this thesis on children and prosthetic aids for them. The reason is that in Czech literature there is no complex information which focuses on specifics for children. The list of synoptic distribution of the types of prosthetic aids was created based on the level of amputation. A large part of this thesis deals with the nursing care, including rehabilitation after amputation and prosthetic solutions. The possibility of the children´s active life with prosthetic aids was mentioned, also how they coped with the loss of a limb. And then the specifics of the nursing care and the attitude of the nursing staff to children and their parents were mentioned too. In the research part of the thesis three aims were set: Find out the limitations or the changes in the family´s life style which has child with prosthesis and the limitations in child´s active life with prosthesis. Ascertain the specifics and the lacks of the nursing care during preparation of children for the prosthetic aid. Based on these following aims the research questions were set: How was the life style of the family with child with prosthetic aid affected? What are the limitations in child´s active life with prosthesis? What are the specifics of the nursing care during preparation of the child for the prosthetic aid? The empirical part of my thesis was processed with qualitative data analysis using technique of the unstructured in-depth interviews. The first research group consisted of seven respondents. Five out of them were parents of the children without the limb and two out of them were children without the limb itself, who were old enough to give us the trustworthy information. The information from the <b>prosthetic</b> <b>technicians</b> was followed with these interviews. The <b>prosthetic</b> <b>technicians</b> clarified us the questions which resulted from reaching the respondents who cannot have all theoretical knowledge regarding the issue. We hope that the results from this thesis will be benefit not only for the medical staff {{to improve the quality of}} the nursing care, but also for the respondents who can find the information which was missing till this time...|$|R
40|$|In Sierra Leone, West Africa, {{there are}} many people with disabilities in need of {{rehabilitation}} services after a long civil war. Purpose: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of prosthetic and orthotic service delivery in Sierra Leone from the local staff’s perspective. Method: Fifteen <b>prosthetic</b> and orthotic <b>technicians</b> working at all the rehabilitation centres providing prosthetic and orthotic services in Sierra Leone were interviewed. The interviews were transcribed and subjected to latent content analysis. Results: One main theme emerged: sense of inability to deliver high-quality prosthetic and orthotic services. This main theme was generated from eight sub-themes: Desire for professional development; appraisals of work satisfaction and norms; patients neglected by family; limited access to the prosthetic and orthotic services available; problems with materials and machines; low public awareness concerning disabilities; marginalisation in society and low priority on the part of government. Conclusions: The findings illustrated traditional beliefs about the causes of disability and that the public’s attitude needs to change to include and value people with disabilities. Support from international organisations was considered necessary as well as educating more prosthetic and orthotic staff to a higher level...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Madagascar is {{the fourth}} biggest island {{and one of the}} poorest {{countries}} in the world, with more than 75 % of the 24 million inhabitants living under poverty line. The health care system in the country is under development, as well as the field of rehabilitation services and the area of prosthetic and orthotic services in specific. There is very limited published research concerning rehabilitation services for people with physical disability in Madagascar. AIM The aim {{of this study was to}} describe and explore the rehabilitation services in Madagascar, with a focus on prosthetic and orthotic services, from the perspective of local rehabilitation staff. METHOD Eight staff members from two rehabilitation centres in Madagascar were interviewed, including one medical doctor, two <b>prosthetic</b> and orthotic <b>technicians,</b> two physiotherapists, one nurse, one social worker, and, one shoemaker. One centre was public and the other centre was run by a nongovernmental organization. Interviews were conducted in English with interpreter to Malagasy. A semi-structured interview guide was used. The data were analysed by using manifest content analysis. RESULTS Three main categories emerged from the analysis: i) Financial situation, distance, attitudes and lack of knowledge stops people from getting rehabilitation service. Dissemination of information about physical disabilities and rehabilitation services were needed to increase the awareness of people in general. There was also a need of more rehabilitation centres with staff to increase the access to rehabilitation services. Many persons with disability could not afford rehabilitation service, and the available financial assistance was not enough to support all who needed the services. However, all people with disability that were coming to the rehabilitation centres were treated equally; ii) Materials, equipment and level of knowledge among staff affect the rehabilitation services. The available materials and equipment differed a lot between the two rehabilitation centres. Further education for the staff was required to improve the quality of rehabilitation service. Appearance and information given by the staff affected acceptance of the assistive devices. Mobility skills were depending on the assistive device, type of disability, and the attitude of the individual patient; iii) Collaboration and communication need to be improved to give a more efficient rehabilitation service. Multidisciplinary approach contributed to good outcome for the patients. Collaboration with, and sponsorship from, nongovernment organizations could increase the quality of rehabilitation service. Furthermore, communication between different professions needed to be improved. An increased collaboration between rehabilitation centres and the Ministry of Health was needed. Finally, community based rehabilitation programs and mobility teams facilitated follow-up services. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION In order to improve rehabilitation services in Madagascar a combination of measures including increased availability to rehabilitation services and increased financial assistance to people with disability is required. Sustainable economic and material supply chains for rehabilitation centres, and, opportunities for the rehabilitation staff to receive professional relevant basic and continuous training is also required. It was highlighted that awareness and knowledge concerning the needs of persons with disability and the existing rehabilitation service should be increased both among politicians and among the general public in Madagascar...|$|R
