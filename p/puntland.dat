5|$|In October 2014, Federal Government {{officials}} {{signed an}} agreement in Garowe with <b>Puntland,</b> which said that the Federal and <b>Puntland</b> authorities will work to form an integrated national army. In April 2015, another bilateral treaty stipulated that <b>Puntland</b> would contribute 3,000 troops to the Somali National Army. In May 2015, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and {{the heads of the}} <b>Puntland,</b> Jubaland and Interim South West Administrations signed a seven-point agreement in Garowe authorizing the immediate deployment of 3,000 troops from <b>Puntland</b> for the Somali National Army. The leaders also agreed to integrate soldiers from the other regional states into the SNA.|$|E
5|$|Eventually the {{leadership}} of the SRRC and the TNG were reconciled, and the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was formed in 2004 by Somali politicians in Nairobi. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed from <b>Puntland</b> was elected as President. The TFG later moved its temporary headquarters to Baidoa. President Yusuf requested that the African Union deploy military forces in Somalia. However, as the AU lacked the resources to do so, Yusuf brought in his own militia from <b>Puntland.</b> Along with the U.S. funding the ARPCT coalition, this alarmed many in south-central Somalia, and recruits flocked to the ascendant Islamic Courts Union (ICU).|$|E
5|$|Bosaso in {{relatively}} stable autonomous <b>Puntland</b> {{emerged as a}} regional hub and major port. A small fishing village prior to {{the fall of the}} state, Bosaso developed a lucrative import/export trade of U.S. $15 million per year out of its port during the 1990s. The population grew in eight years from 5,000 to 150,000, sustained by public services provided on a competitive basis by private enterprise, and court systems, schools and a university founded by the local community.|$|E

5|$|In December 2006, Ethiopian troops entered Somalia {{to assist}} the TFG against the {{advancing}} Islamic Courts Union, initially winning the Battle of Baidoa. On 28 December 2006, the allied forces recaptured the capital from the ICU. The offensive helped the TFG solidify its rule. Ethiopian and TFG forces forced the ICU from Ras Kamboni between 7–12 January 2007. They were assisted by at least two U.S. air strikes. On 8 January 2007, {{for the first time}} since taking office, President Ahmed entered Mogadishu from Baidoa as the TFG moved its base to the national capital. President Ahmed brought his <b>Puntland</b> army chief with him, and Abdullahi Ali Omar became Somali chief of army on 10 February 2007.|$|E
5|$|Somalia, from 1991 to 2006, {{is cited}} as a {{real-world}} example of a stateless society and legal system. Since the fall of Siad Barre's government in January 1991, {{there had been no}} central government in Somalia until the establishment of the Transitional National Government and its successor the Transitional Federal Government. Large areas of the country such as <b>Puntland,</b> Somaliland and Galmudug were internationally unrecognized and administered as autonomous regions of Somalia. The remaining areas, including the capital Mogadishu, were divided into smaller territories ruled by competing faction leaders. In many areas, there were no formal regulations or licensing requirements for businesses and individuals.|$|E
5|$|The SAF was {{initially}} {{made up of}} the Army, Navy, Air Force and Police Force. In the post-independence period, it grew to become among the larger militaries in Africa. Due to Barre's increasing reliance on his own clans, repressive policies, and the Somali Rebellion, the military had by 1988 begun to disintegrate. By the time President Siad Barre fled in 1991, the armed forces had dissolved. As of January 2014, the security sector is overseen by the Federal Government of Somalia's Ministry of Defence, Ministry of National Security, and Ministry of Interior and Federalism. The Somaliland, <b>Puntland</b> and Galmudug regional governments maintain their own security and police forces.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, U.S. diplomats {{spoke with}} the TFG's Ambassador to Ethiopia. Among the topics of {{conversation}} were Somali security forces, and Ambassador Abdulkarim Farah said that the TFG had trained nearly 7,000 militia in Baledogle who were now patrolling throughout Somalia, from Kismayo to <b>Puntland.</b> Another 3,500 militia were undergoing training. Farah said that on May 18 he planned to his hometown of Beledweyne to establish a militia training camp there, at the instruction of President Yusuf. Farah estimated that approximately 60 per cent of the militia were Darod, 30 per cent were Hawiye, and the remaining 10 per cent were from other clans; the majority of security forces in Mogadishu were Darod. He said that the TFG had not sought to exclude Darod from the militia, and attributed the imbalance to Hawiye having primarily supported the Council of Islamic Courts (CIC).|$|E
25|$|Tertiary {{education}} in Somalia refers to education offered on completion of secondary education. Teacher education, for convenience, is grouped under this category. Tertiary {{education in}} the context of <b>Puntland</b> thus includes university education, instruction offered through diploma–level institutions such as community and teacher colleges. The <b>Puntland</b> region currently counts five major universities: <b>Puntland</b> State University in Garowe, <b>Puntland</b> State University in Galkayo, Bosaso College in Bosaso, Mogadishu University <b>Puntland</b> Branch in Bosaso, and East Africa University in Bosaso, Galkayo and Garowe.|$|E

25|$|<b>Puntland</b> has {{the lowest}} rate of poverty in Somalia, with 27%, {{compared}} to 50% in Somaliland and 57% in Mogadishu. Experts believe {{this is because of}} higher consumption and higher labour force participation. Households in <b>Puntland</b> consume a higher quantity per capita per item and more items per household. The lower rate of poverty {{does not appear to be}} driven by household size, as the average in <b>Puntland</b> is 5.2, compared to 5.7 in Somaliland and 4.5 in Mogadishu. <b>Puntland</b> is doing better in various important indicators of well-being. For instance, the literacy rate in <b>Puntland</b> is 64% compared to the national average of 55%. Additionally, households in <b>Puntland</b> also outperform the average in other educational outcomes such as enrolment and educational attainment. 70% of households in <b>Puntland</b> have access to improved water sources compared to the national average of 58%. Therefore, Puntland’s higher performance on non-monetary indicators of well-being are inline with its lower rate of poverty.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Puntland</b> {{government}} {{established a}} <b>Puntland</b> Disaster Management and Rescue committee to oversee local relief {{efforts in the}} wake of the cylone. <b>Puntland</b> Maritime Police Force units and government rescue teams were also deployed to the impacted areas. PMPF troops assisted in the transportation of emergency supplies, including blankets, tents, non-perishable food items and medicines. Accessibility to the most affected areas was slowed by flash floods and the collapse of a bridge linking Bosaso with the administrative capital Garowe. Government rescue teams consequently utilized donkey carts to reach remote localities. The <b>Puntland</b> Highway Authority (PHA) also established an alternative land route for trucks transporting relief materials. In total, the <b>Puntland</b> government sent 32 trucks carrying supplies to the affected areas.|$|E
