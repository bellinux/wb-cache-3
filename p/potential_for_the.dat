5|$|Octaphenylrhodocene, , is {{the first}} rhodocene {{derivative}} to be isolated at room temperature. Its olive green crystals decompose rapidly in solution, and within minutes in air, demonstrating a dramatically greater air sensitivity than the analogous cobalt complex, although it is significantly more stable than rhodocene itself. This difference is attributed to the relatively lower stability of the rhodium(II) state {{as compared to the}} cobalt(II) state. The reduction <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> + cation (measured in dimethylformamide relative the ferrocenium / ferrocene couple) is −1.44V, consistent with the greater thermodynamic stabilisation of the rhodocene by the C5HPh4 ligand compared with the C5H5 or C5Me5 ligands. Cobaltocene is a useful one-electron reducing agent in the research laboratory as it is soluble in non-polar organic solvents, and its redox couple is sufficiently well behaved that it may be used as an internal standard in cyclic voltammetry. No substituted rhodocene yet prepared has demonstrated sufficient stability to be used in a similar way.|$|E

5|$|On November6, 2015, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west coast}} of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean. Only sporadic convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—accompanied the system as it traveled west for the next ten days. As it reached the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November17, westerly winds associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone spurred the development of an area of low pressure and extensive convection. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> system to develop into {{a tropical}} cyclone; however, persistent wind shear inhibited this system from consolidating before it reached Central America. The system emerged over the Pacific Ocean near Nicaragua on November21; once back over water, convection blossomed near the low's center.

5|$|People have {{struggled}} to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia. Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life. The cultivation of semi-arid regions encourages erosion of soil {{and is one of}} the causes of increased desertification. Desert farming is possible with the aid of irrigation and the Imperial Valley in California provides an example of how previously barren land can be made productive by the import of water from an outside source. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts, especially across the Sahara Desert, and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt, gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara. Some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts and the uninterrupted sunlight gives <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> capture of large quantities of solar energy.|$|E
