5|$|At present, {{the continents}} of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have {{produced}} several scenarios {{about how this}} will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes <b>preferentially</b> subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains <b>preferentially</b> subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 and HIV-2 {{appear to}} package their RNA differently. HIV-1 will bind to any {{appropriate}} RNA. HIV-2 will <b>preferentially</b> bind to the mRNA {{that was used}} to create the Gag protein itself.|$|E
5|$|In {{tropical}} Sargassum and Turbinaria {{species that}} are often <b>preferentially</b> consumed by herbivorous fishes and echinoids, there is a relatively low level of phenolics and tannins.|$|E
5|$|Vacancy-di-interstitial pairs {{have been}} also produced, though by {{electron}} irradiation {{and through a}} different mechanism: Individual interstitials migrate during the irradiation and aggregate to form di-interstitials; this process occurs <b>preferentially</b> near the lattice vacancies.|$|E
5|$|Vitamin E is the {{collective}} {{name for a}} set of eight related tocopherols and tocotrienols, which are fat-soluble vitamins with antioxidant properties. Of these, α-tocopherol has been most studied as it has the highest bioavailability, with the body <b>preferentially</b> absorbing and metabolising this form.|$|E
5|$|After production, the fermium must be {{separated}} from other actinides and from lanthanide fission products. This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are <b>preferentially</b> eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{species such}} as Gnathamitermes tubiformans have {{seasonal}} food habits. For example, they may <b>preferentially</b> consume Red three-awn (Aristida longiseta) during the summer, Buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides) from May to August, and blue grama Bouteloua gracilis during spring, summer and autumn. Colonies of G.tubiformans consume less food in spring than they do during autumn when their feeding activity is high.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women <b>preferentially,</b> and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|In around 1 {{percent of}} infections, {{poliovirus}} spreads along certain nerve fiber pathways, <b>preferentially</b> replicating in and destroying motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex. This {{leads to the}} development of paralytic poliomyelitis, the various forms of which (spinal, bulbar, and bulbospinal) vary only with the amount of neuronal damage and inflammation that occurs, and the region of the CNS affected.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the choughs {{include the}} {{peregrine}} falcon, golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl, while the common raven will take nestlings. In northern Spain, red-billed choughs <b>preferentially</b> nest near lesser kestrel colonies; the falcon, which eats only insects, provides {{a degree of}} protection against larger predators, and the chough benefits {{in terms of a}} higher breeding success. The red-billed chough is occasionally parasitised by the great spotted cuckoo, a brood parasite for which the Eurasian magpie is the primary host.|$|E
5|$|Sarus cranes <b>preferentially</b> use {{wetlands}} or uncultivated patches amid flooded {{rice paddies}} (locally called khet-taavadi) for nesting in India. Breeding pairs are territorial and prefer to forage in natural wetlands, though wet crops like rice and wheat are also frequented. In south-western Uttar Pradesh, sarus cranes {{were found in}} wetlands of all sizes with larger number in larger wetlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{content of}} MFGM in dairy {{products}} {{varies depending on}} the processing involved. During dairy processing such as churning or decreaming, the MFGM is disrupted and <b>preferentially</b> distributed into aqueous phases such as buttermilk, butter serum, or certain type of whey. Thus {{they can be a}} good source of MFGM for addition into food products.|$|E
5|$|This {{characteristic}} {{is employed}} in analytical techniques using EDTA as a ligand. EDTA <b>preferentially</b> forms octahedral complexes– thus absorbing other cations such as Al3+ which might interfere – for example, in the solvent extraction {{of a complex}} formed between Be2+ and acetylacetone. Beryllium(II) readily forms complexes with strong donating ligands such as phosphine oxides and arsine oxides. There have been extensive studies of these complexes which show {{the stability of the}} O-Be bond.|$|E
5|$|To inhibit corrosion, {{at least}} 11% {{chromium}} {{is added to}} steel so that a hard oxide forms on the metal surface; {{this is known as}} stainless steel. Tungsten slows the formation of cementite, keeping carbon in the iron matrix and allowing martensite to <b>preferentially</b> form at slower quench rates, resulting in high speed steel. On the other hand, sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus are considered contaminants that make steel more brittle and are removed from the steel melt during processing.|$|E
5|$|Although cheetahs and leopards <b>preferentially</b> prey {{on smaller}} animals than those hunted by spotted hyenas, hyenas will steal their kills when the {{opportunity}} presents itself. Cheetahs are usually easily intimidated by hyenas, and put up little resistance, while leopards, particularly males, may stand up to hyenas. There are records of some male leopards preying on hyenas. Hyenas are nonetheless dangerous opponents for leopards; {{there is at least}} one record of a young adult male leopard dying from a septicemia infection caused by wounds inflicted by a spotted hyena. There is also a case of two spotted hyenas killing and eating a young leopard in Timbavati Game Reserve, after a young hyena was killed by the leopard.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many of the}} afore-mentioned inhibitors {{share the}} same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), {{it has been shown}} that some of these drugs <b>preferentially</b> access {{distinct}} Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their post-translational modification. Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study has shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide isoform specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.|$|E
5|$|An {{indication}} of the army's high esteem for barbarian-born troops is that {{they appear to have}} been <b>preferentially</b> recruited to the elite units of the late imperial era's armies. In the auxilia palatina infantry regiments, the proportion of barbarians in the ranks appears to have numbered anywhere between a third and a half of effectives (compared to a quarter in the army as a whole). From the late 3rd century onwards, barbarian recruitment became crucial to the army's continued existence, by providing a much-needed source of first-rate recruits.|$|E
5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. It {{has been found that}} encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae <b>preferentially</b> settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded in their ability to swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1968, {{his father}} John S. McCain Jr. was named {{commander}} of all U.S. {{forces in the}} Vietnam theater, and the North Vietnamese offered McCain early release {{because they wanted to}} appear merciful for propaganda purposes, and also to show other POWs that elite prisoners were willing to be treated <b>preferentially.</b> McCain refused repatriation unless every man taken in before him was also released. Such early release was prohibited by the POWs' interpretation of the military Code of Conduct which states in Article III: “I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy”. To prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda, officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured.|$|E
5|$|Like other elements, {{a variety}} of {{processes}} alter the relative abundance of calcium isotopes. The best studied of these processes is the mass-dependent fractionation of calcium isotopes that accompanies the precipitation of calcium minerals such as calcite, aragonite and apatite from solution. Lighter isotopes are <b>preferentially</b> incorporated into these minerals, leaving the surrounding solution enriched in heavier isotopes at a magnitude of roughly 0.025% per atomic mass unit (amu) at room temperature. Mass-dependent differences in calcium isotope composition are conventionally expressed by the ratio of two isotopes (usually 44Ca/40Ca) in a sample compared to the same ratio in a standard reference material. 44Ca/40Ca varies by about 1% among common earth materials.|$|E
5|$|Nutria were {{introduced}} into coastal marshes from South America in the mid-1900s, and their population has since exploded into the millions. They cause serious damage to coastal marshes and may dig burrows in levees. Hence, Louisiana {{has had a}} bounty to try to reduce nutria numbers. Large American alligators, however, feed heavily on nutria, so American alligators may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them spreading east into the Everglades. Since hunting and trapping <b>preferentially</b> take the large American alligators that {{are the most important}} in eating nutria, some changes in harvesting may be needed to capitalize on their ability to control nutria.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis is {{a disease}} of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is {{believed}} to be present on the surface of most or all human cells. Therefore, receptor expression does not explain why poliovirus <b>preferentially</b> infects certain tissues. This suggests that tissue tropism is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the type I interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication. In mice expressing CD155 (through genetic engineering) but lacking the type I interferon receptor, poliovirus not only replicates in an expanded repertoire of tissue types, but these mice are also able to be infected orally with the virus.|$|E
5|$|The New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) {{is a major}} visitor and {{pollinator}} of Banksia verticillata. These birds {{can travel}} 15m (50ft) between inflorescences in a feeding session, and <b>preferentially</b> choose flower spikes with partly opened flowers. Other honeyeater species observed, the white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris nigra) and western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus), visit this species to a much lesser extent. The brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta) has also been recorded as a visitor. Small mammals are not major pollinators, although bush rats (Rattus fuscipes) and house mice (Mus musculus) have been recorded. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) visit flower spikes but are not effective pollinators.|$|E
5|$|The eight living pelican {{species were}} {{traditionally}} {{divided into two}} groups, one containing four ground-nesters with mainly white adult plumage (Australian, Dalmatian, great white, and American white pelicans), and one containing four grey or brown plumaged species which nest <b>preferentially</b> either in trees (pink-backed, spot-billed and brown pelicans), or on sea rocks (Peruvian pelican). The largely marine brown and Peruvian pelicans, formerly considered conspecific, are sometimes separated from the others by placement in the subgenus Leptopelicanus but in fact species with both sorts of appearance and nesting behavior are found in either.|$|E
5|$|The {{first factor}} {{determining}} optimal defense is risk: {{how likely is}} it that a plant or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is also related to the plant apparency hypothesis, which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores. Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses. Unapparent plants, such as short-lived plants of early successional stages, on the other hand, <b>preferentially</b> invest in small amounts of qualitative toxins that are effective against {{all but the most}} specialized herbivores.|$|E
5|$|The hydroid Hydractinia angusta has a mutualistic {{relationship}} with the scallop. A study showed that its larvae <b>preferentially</b> settled {{in the vicinity of}} other epibionts, usually on scallop shells, and that the scallop larvae were deterred from settling in the vicinity of colonies of the hydroid. It is surmised that the hydroid benefits from a solid substrate on which to live, and although the scallop benefits from the protection from predators provided by the stinging cells of the hydroid, it is disadvantaged by the failure of its larvae to establish themselves in their preferred location, on the shells of mature scallops.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough's predators {{include the}} {{peregrine}} falcon, golden eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl, while the common raven will take nestlings. In northern Spain, red-billed choughs <b>preferentially</b> nest near lesser kestrel colonies. This small insectivorous falcon is better at detecting a predator and more vigorous in defence than its corvid neighbours. The breeding {{success of the}} red-billed chough {{in the vicinity of}} the kestrels was found to be much higher than that of birds elsewhere, with a lower percentage of nest failures (16% near the falcon, 65% elsewhere).|$|E
5|$|The wasps <b>preferentially</b> {{hunt for}} female cicadas {{because they have}} more {{consumable}} tissue, but male cicadas are easier to locate, which explains the systemic bias towards male kills. They chiefly hunt for Tibicen duryi, Tibicen dealbata and Tibicen parallela. Cicada killers are capable of thermoregulation, which allows them to hunt for cicadas during the day, when the cicadas are most prominent. The species is mostly harmless to humans. Some males when emerging early fly into the trees to feed on sap, and the species {{has been known to}} feed on nectar.|$|E
5|$|This {{increased}} severity {{has been}} attributed to the circumstances of the First World War. In civilian life, natural selection favours a mild strain. Those who get very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, <b>preferentially</b> spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).|$|E
5|$|Though the Pacific {{electric}} ray will feed at any hour, it responds to prey {{much more quickly}} at night than during the day. Most prey captures occur in darkness or turbid conditions, when its eyes are largely useless. Instead, it relies on electroreception via its ampullae of Lorenzini to locate food. Experiments in the field have shown that it will attack artificially generated electric fields and conductive metal electrodes. Mechanical sensory cues, detected via the lateral line, also play an important role: this species has been observed <b>preferentially</b> attacking faster-moving prey even if a closer food item was available.|$|E
5|$|Under each foreleg, the {{sea otter}} has a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest. In this pouch (<b>preferentially</b> the left one), the animal stores {{collected}} food {{to bring to}} the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. There, the sea otter eats while floating on its back, using its forepaws to tear food apart and bring it to its mouth. It can chew and swallow small mussels with their shells, whereas large mussel shells may be twisted apart. It uses its lower incisor teeth to access the meat in shellfish.|$|E
5|$|Other {{formations}} {{were also}} formed but were mostly eroded following uplift from the Laramide orogeny which started around 70million years ago (mya). This event created the Rocky Mountains {{far to the}} east and helped to close the sea that covered the area. A large part of western North America started to stretch itself into the nearby Basin and Range topography around 15mya. While not part of this region, the greater Bryce area was stretched into the High Plateaus by the same forces. Uplift of the Colorado Plateaus and the opening of the Gulf of California by 5mya changed the drainage of the Colorado River and its tributaries, including the Paria River, which is eroding headward in between two plateaus adjacent to the park. The uplift caused the formation of vertical joints which were later <b>preferentially</b> eroded to form the free-standing pinnacles called hoodoos, badlands, and monoliths we see today.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox virus <b>preferentially</b> attacks skin cells, {{causing the}} {{characteristic}} pimples (called macules) {{associated with the}} disease. A rash develops on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appear. Typically the macules first appear on the forehead, then rapidly spread to the whole face, proximal portions of extremities, the trunk, and lastly to distal portions of extremities. The process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours, after which no new lesions appear. At this point variola major infection can take several very different courses, resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification: ordinary, modified, malignant (or flat), and hemorrhagic. Historically, smallpox has an overall fatality rate of about 30 percent; however, the malignant and hemorrhagic forms are usually fatal.|$|E
5|$|The diving reflex is a {{response}} to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes. It optimises respiration by <b>preferentially</b> distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, which allows extended periods underwater. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins and muskrats), and also exists in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. The diving reflex is triggered by chilling the face and holding the breath. The cardiovascular system constricts peripheral blood vessels, slows the pulse rate, redirects blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, releases red blood cells stored in the spleen, and, in humans, causes heart rhythm irregularities. Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but apnea, slowed pulse rate, and vasoconstriction are shared with terrestrial mammals.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reaction}} of the host tree is traced to the adult wasp and occurs after 10 to 14 days. A phytotoxic secretion of the wasp impairs metabolism in the shoots and needles, causing loss of water balance. The result is brown coloration of the needles and leaf drop. As with many other wood pests, fine resin drops in wasp boreholes {{are found in the}} central trunk. Attacked pines tend to develop flagging. Tip dieback begins with the needles becoming chlorotic and changing from green to yellowish-red, finally turning completely brown over a three- to six-month period. The wasp bores 1/8- to 3/8-inch-diameter holes in the tree. Unstressed trees may be attacked uniformly along the main stem, while trees with low osmotic phloem pressure are <b>preferentially</b> attacked, with denser clusters of boreholes.|$|E
5|$|When {{targeting}} livestock, {{the spotted}} hyena primarily preys upon cattle, sheep and goats, though hyenas {{in the southern}} parts of Ethiopia's Tigray region <b>preferentially</b> target donkeys. Reports of livestock damage are often not substantiated, and hyenas observed scavenging on a carcass may be mistaken for having killed the animal. The {{rate at which the}} species targets livestock may depend on a number of factors, including stock keeping practices, the availability of wild prey and human-associated sources of organic material, such as rubbish. Surplus killing has been recorded in South Africa's eastern Cape Province. Attacks on stock tend to be fewer in areas where livestock is coralled by thorn fences and where domestic dogs are present. One study in northern Kenya revealed that 90% of all cases of livestock predation by hyenas occurred in areas outside the protection of thorn fences.|$|E
