During this period, over 45 000 serum samples from 2833 hold-ings were examined using the hemagglutination in-hibition test (HI). The presence of HI antibodies was detected in 8 breeder geese holdings (7 positive for H 5 and 1 positive for H 7 AIV) and in 1 breeder duck holding (H 5 -positive), which represented 0. 32 % of all investigated holdings. All seropositive flocks were examined by real time RT-PCR with negative results, which substantiated the AI-free status of Poland.

Currently, it remains a major threat in countries with poor <b>poultry</b> <b>surveillance</b> and no efficient control measures. As S.

Forty-five proteins were screened out, and their functions were implicated in molecular biosynthesis and degradation, transport, metabolism, regulation, cell wall synthesis and antibiotic resistance, environmental adaptation, or putative functions. In addition, 11 of these 45 genes were assessed for their differential expression by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), revealing that 9 of 11 genes were upregulated to dif-ferent degrees under in vivo conditions, especially the regulator of virulence determinants, phoQ. Then, four in vivo-induced proteins (ShdA, PhoQ, Cse 3, and PbpC) were tested for their immunoreactivity in 28 clinical serum samples from chickens in-fected with S. Pullorum. The rate of detection of antibodies against ShdA reached 82 % and was the highest among these proteins. ShdA is a host colonization factor known to be upregulated in vivo and related to the persistence of S. Typhimurium in the intes-tine.

Methods The H 7 RRT PCRs amplified within the (i) HA 2 and (ii) cleavage site CS {{regions of the}} haemagglutinin gene. Both were validated against 65 H 7 AIVs, 57 non-H 7 AIVs and 259 poultry swabs in comparison to M gene (AI generic) RRT PCR and virus isolation (VI). An additional 38 swabs and 20 tissue specimens extended validation against M gene RRT PCR. Results Both H 7 RRT PCRs amplified all 61 Eurasian lineage H 7 AIVs and none of 57 non-H 7 AIVs. A total of 297 poultry swabs {{were used to determine}} diagnostic sensitivity and specificity relative to M gene RRT PCR, sensitivity was 95 center dot 4 % and 64 center dot 6 % for the HA 2 and CS RRT PCRs respectively, and specificity 97 center dot 9 % and 99 center dot 6 % respectively. The H 7 HA 2 RRT PCR was more sensitive than VI. This was emphasized by analysis of 37 swabs from turkeys infected experimentally with HPAI H 7 N 1 virus sampled at 24 hours post-inoculation and LPAI H 7 N 1 chicken infections sampled at 40 - 64 hours.

To date, <b>poultry</b> <b>surveillance</b> in Vietnam has focused on detection of influenza H 5 viruses, and there is limited understanding of influenza H 9 epidemiology and transmission dynamics. We determined prevalence and diversity of influenza A viruses in chickens from live bird markets (LBM) of 7 northern Vietnamese provinces, using pooled oropharyngeal swabs collected from October to December 2014. Screening by real time RT-PCR revealed 1207 / 4900 (24. 6 %) of pooled swabs to be influenza A virus positive; overall prevalence estimates after accounting for pooling (5 swabs/pools) were 5. 8 % (CI 5. 4 – 6. 0). Subtyping was performed on 468 pooled swabs with M gene Ct< 26. No influenza H 7 was detected; 422 (90. 1 %) were H 9 positive; and 22 (4. 7 %) were H 5 positive. There was no evidence was of interaction between H 9 and H 5 virus detection rates. We sequenced 17 whole genomes of A/H 9 N 2, 2 of A/H 5 N 6, and 11 partial genomes. All H 9 N 2 viruses had internal genes that clustered with genotype 57 and were closely related to Chinese human isolates of A/H 7 N 9 and A/H 10 N 8. Using a nucleotide divergence cutoff of 98 %, we identified 9 distinct H 9 genotypes.

40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) virus poses a significant economic disease burden to the poultry sector of Vietnam, {{and is a}} credible threat for emergence of novel zoonotic viruses. This thesis examines the molecular evolution and epidemiology of HPAI A(H 5) viruses in Vietnam identified through the national <b>poultry</b> <b>surveillance</b> system. The investigations comprised analysis of detection rates and geographic distribution of A(H 5) clade variants from samples collected in live bird markets (LBMs); comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequences of viruses collected from 2012 to 2015; development of laboratory protocols for production of reference chicken antisera; and in-depth antigenic characterisations of contemporary A(H 5 N 1) isolates. The ï¬ndings underscored the high prevalence and widespread distribution of HPAI A(H 5) virus within apparently healthy poultry sampled in LBMs and the difficulties in designing appropriate and effective disease management strategies. Whole genome analysis revealed significant diversification and reassortment of A(H 5) viruses, with substantial in-situ evolution of clade 1 and 2. 3. 4 viruses between 2010 and 2012 and lineage replacements involving clade 2. 3. 2. 1 and 2. 3. 4. 4 viruses during 2014 - 2015. Antigenic analysis of contemporary A(H 5 N 1) clade variants using chicken antisera produced at the National Center for Veterinary Diagnostics (NCVD) proved to be feasible and reproducible, and recapitulated similar patterns of clade clustering as ferret antisera. Antigenic relationships between existing poultry vaccines and circulating field viruses also appeared aligned with in-vivo vaccine challenge studies, in terms of protection profiles. Given the co-circulation of multiple, antigenically distinct clade variants, {{there is a great}} need for vaccine strategies capable of inducing broadly cross-reactive immunity. If traditional inactivated vaccines are used, bivalent or trivalent formulations may be required. The results strongly suggest that antigenic data could ultimately be used as a surrogate (or as a precursor) to challenge studies that take time and resources to conduct, thus potentially enabling more rapid assessments and decisions about poultry vaccine selection by Vietnamese animal health authorities. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A crucial goal of {{infectious}} disease surveillance {{is the early}} detection of epidemics, which is essential for disease control. In China, the current surveillance system is based on confirmed case reports. In rural China, it is not practical for health units to perform laboratory tests to confirm disease and {{people are more likely}} to get 'old' and emerging infectious diseases due to poor living conditions and closer contacts with wild animals and <b>poultry.</b> Syndromic <b>surveillance,</b> which collects non-specific syndromes before diagnosis, has great advantages in promoting the early detection of epidemics and reducing the necessities of disease confirmation. It will be especially effective for surveillance in resource poor settings. Methods/Design This is a field experimental study. The experimental tool is an innovative electronic surveillance system, combining syndromic surveillance with the existing case report surveillance in four selected counties in China. In the added syndromic surveillance, three types of data are collected including patients' major symptoms from health clinics, pharmaceutical sales from pharmacies and absenteeism information from primary school. In order to evaluate the early warning capability of the new added syndromic surveillance, the timelines and validity of the alert signals will be analyzed in comparison with the traditional case reporting system. The acceptability, feasibility and economic evaluation of the whole integrated surveillance system will be conducted in a before and after study design. Discussions Although syndromic surveillance system has mostly been established in developed areas, there are opportunities and advantages of developing it in rural China. The project will contribute to knowledge, experience and evidence on the establishment of an integrated surveillance system, which aims to provide early warning of disease epidemics in developing countries. </p...|$|R

Its distribution is largely widespread over Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe. Since 1978, it has frequently been reported in Madagascar. Studies described a high seroprevalence level of the virus in humans in different areas of the island and a human fatal case of WNV infection was reported in 2011. Despite these reports, the epidemiology of WNV in Madagascar, in particular, viral circulation remains unclear. To explore the transmission of WNV in two rural human populations of Madagascar, we investigated local mosquitoes and poultry for evidence of current infections, and determined seroprevalence of candidate sentinel species among the local poultry. These 2 areas are close to lakes where domestic birds, migratory wild birds and humans coexist. Serological analysis revealed WNV antibodies in domestic birds (duck, chicken, goose, turkey and guinea fowl) sampled in both districts (Antsalova 29. 4 % and Mitsinjo 16. 7 %).

40|$|It {{is unknown}} how the current Asian origin highly {{pathogenic}} avian influenza H 5 viruses arrived, but these viruses are now poised to become endemic in North America.

Active <b>surveillance</b> of live wild birds is likely {{the best way to}} determine the true distribution of these viruses. We also suggest that sampling be focused on regions with the greatest risk for poultry losses and attempt to define the mechanisms of transfer to enhance biosecurity. Responding to the recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in North America requires an efficient plan with clear objectives and potential management outcomes. Background The original United States interagency strategic plan for detection of Asian highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 avian influ-enza was developed nearly a decade ago, with focus on the early detection of an exotic virus [1]. The current out-breaks of HPAI H 5 N 8 and H 5 N 2, caused by foreign origin viruses, have very quickly become widely distributed within North America, thus negating the need for early detection at the broad scale. Two new avian influenza sur-veillance and monitoring documents have been recently released that address early detection at local and regional scales. One focuses on detection of HPAI in waterfowl in high priority watersheds and the spread of viruses to new areas of concern [2]. The other encompasses a strategy for early detection of avian influenza viruses of significance in wild birds in general, and encourages sampling of areas with high poultry density [3]. We propose taking these plans a step further by suggesting a 2 -tiered surveillance strategy focusing on waterfowl and bridge species in the vicinity of poultry operations. This 2 -step sampling design would address the mechanism(s) of virus transfer and pro-vide data that can inform management actions that minimize the impact of these viruses on domestic poultry.

We analyzed 506 avian specimens collected from poultry in live bird markets and backyard flocks to identify influenza A viruses. Virus isolation-positive specimens (n = 50) were subtyped and their coding-complete genomes were sequenced. The most frequently identified subtypes among LPAI isolates were H 9 N 2, H 11 N 3, H 4 N 6, and H 1 N 1. Less frequently detected subtypes included H 1 N 3, H 2 N 4, H 3 N 2, H 3 N 6, H 3 N 8, H 4 N 2, H 5 N 2, H 6 N 1, H 6 N 7, and H 7 N 9. Gene sequences were compared to publicly available sequences using phylogenetic inference approaches. Among the 14 subtypes identified, the majority of viral gene segments were most closely related to poultry or wild bird viruses commonly found in Southeast Asia, Europe, and/or northern Africa. LPAI subtypes were distributed over several geographic locations in Bangladesh, and surface and internal protein gene segments clustered phylogenetically with a diverse number of viral subtypes suggesting extensive reassortment among these LPAI viruses. H 9 N 2 subtype viruses differed from other LPAI subtypes because genes from these viruses consistently clustered together, indicating this subtype is enzootic in Bangladesh. The H 9 N 2 strains identified in Bangladesh were phylogenetically and antigenically related to previous human-derived H 9 N 2 viruses detected in Bangladesh representing a potential source for human infection. In contrast, the circulating LPAI H 5 N 2 and H 7 N 9 viruses were both phylogenetically and antigenically unrelated to H 5 viruses identified previously in humans in Bangladesh and H 7 N 9 strains isolated from humans in China. In Bangladesh, domestic poultry sold in live bird markets carried {{a wide range of}} LPAI virus subtypes and a high diversity of genotypes.

40|$|Abstract Introduction More than 70 {{outbreaks}} {{of the highly}} pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H 5 N 1 {{have been reported in}} poultry in the western and north-eastern parts of India. Therefore, in view of the recent HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks in <b>poultry,</b> active AI <b>surveillance</b> encompassing wild, resident, migratory birds and poultry was undertaken during 2009 – 2011 in the State of West Bengal. Methods A total of 5722 samples were collected from West Bengal; 3522 samples (2906 fecal droppings[*]+[*] 616 other environmental samples) were from migratory birds and 2200 samples [1604 tracheal, cloacal swabs, environmental samples, tissue samples[*]+[*] 596 blood (serum) ] were from domestic ducks and poultry. All tracheal, cloacal and environmental samples were processed for virus isolation. Virus isolates were detected using hemagglutination assay and identified using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partial region of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes was done. Intravenous pathogenicity index assays were performed in chickens to assess pathogenicity of AI virus isolates. Serum samples were tested for detection of antibodies against AI viruses using HI assay. Results A total of 57 AI H 9 N 2, 15 AI H 4 N 6 and 15 Newcastle Disease (NDV) viruses were isolated from chickens, from both backyard and wet poultry markets; AI H 4 N 6 viruses were isolated from backyard chickens and domestic ducks. Characterization of AI H 9 N 2 and H 4 N 6 viruses revealed that they were of low pathogenicity. Domestic ducks were positive for antibodies against H 5 and H 7 viruses while chickens were positive for presence of antibodies against AI H 9 N 2 and NDV. Conclusions In the current scenario of HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks in West Bengal, this report shows presence of low pathogenic AI H 9 N 2 and H 4 N 6 viruses in chickens and domestic ducks during the period 2009 – 2011. This is the first report of isolation of H 4 N 6 from India. Antibodies against AI H 5 and H 7 in ducks highlight the probable role of domestic ducks in the transmission of AI viruses. Human infections of H 9 N 2 have been reported from China and Hong Kong. This necessitates implementation of prevention and control measures to limit the spread of AI viruses. </p...|$|R

Selection {{of the best}} method of emergency mass depopulation needs to maximize human health and safety while minimizing disease spread and animal welfare concerns. The method used must be compatible with species, age, housing type, and disposal options. Research has shown differences in gassing and foam depopulation procedures when comparing time to and consistency of time to brain death. An overall goal of this project {{was to find a}} way to evaluate the welfare of the poultry subjected to a depopulation treatment. During depopulation, the time to unconsciousness needs to be evaluated to determine when the birds are no longer aware of their surroundings or feeling any pain. This study consisted of two experiments to evaluate the efficacy of mass depopulation methods. Experiment 1 was conducted as a proof of concept for the use of the alpha/delta (A/D) ratio in evaluating the time to loss of consciousness in poultry. Experiment 2 was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of two mass depopulation methods on turkeys. The methods that were tested were carbon dioxide (CO 2) gassing and water based foam. In Experiment 1, the use of the alpha/delta ratio was evaluated as a method to analyze poultry time to unconsciousness using layer hens. Experiment 1 tested the use of the alpha/delta ratio under controlled anesthesia and the resulting unconsciousness. This study was done as a proof of concept for application to subsequent studies. The results of this study indicate that there is a consistent suppression pattern in the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness. The alpha/delta ratio was suppressed by the effects of the isoflurane as the bird began to lose consciousness. The layer hens were found to become unconscious an average of 278 seconds after the start of the treatment with a standard deviation of 113 seconds. This concept was then used to evaluate the time to loss of consciousness in turkeys during depopulation in Experiment 2. The purpose of Experiment 2 was to evaluate the efficacy of two different treatments used for depopulating market age turkeys. This experiment was conducted using a randomized block design with commercial male turkeys exposed to one of two randomly selected depopulation treatments; either 100 % CO 2 gas or water based foam with ambient air. The time to unconsciousness, terminal convulsions, brain death, and cardiac relaxation were recorded for each bird. The time to unconsciousness and brain death were evaluated using the EEG signals recorded from a wireless transmitter surgically implanted into the brain of the bird. Motion cessation was determined through analysis of data recorded from an accelerometer attached to the turkey's leg during depopulation. Cardiac relaxation was evaluated through analysis of the ECG data recorded via wired electrode pads attached to the wing and legs. Being able to determine the point of unconsciousness allows for better evaluation of the effectiveness of different depopulation methods. Critical times for physiological events were extracted from the EEG, ECG, and accelerometer data and were compiled in Excel and statistical analysis was performed using SAS. The data subsets were not normally distributed and thus a non-parametric statistical analysis was conducted on each data subset in SAS. A Wilcoxon Exact test was used to analyze the treatment-dependent data sets. All tests were conducted at the 5 % (α = 0. 05) significance level. There was a statistically significant difference in the time to brain death between the two methods. Water based foam was the fastest treatment with respect to brain death (μ = 190 sec). The CO 2 gas was significantly slower (μ = 242 sec). Water based foam resulted in faster (μ = 64 sec) time to unconsciousness than CO 2 gas (μ = 90 sec). The time to terminal convulsions of the birds showed that there was no statistically significant difference in the time to motion cessation for water based foam (μ= 166 sec) and CO 2 gassing (μ= 174 sec). The time difference for cardiac relaxation for water based foam (μ= 208 sec) and the CO 2 gas (μ= 242 sec) are not statistically significant. The results of this experiment show that water based foam is more effective at causing brain death than the CO 2 gas. Though not statistically significant, water based foam caused unconsciousness, cardiac relaxation and motion cessation faster than CO 2 gas. The times to brain death and unconsciousness for water based foam were also more consistent, with less variation from the mean compared to CO 2 gas. When comparing water based foam and CO 2 gas, there are other qualitative advantages to the use of the water based foam including responder safety and emotional welfare as well as compatibility with carcass composting. This information may also play a role in how agencies such as the USDA and organizations such as AVMA evaluate water based foam for mass emergency depopulation of poultry.
