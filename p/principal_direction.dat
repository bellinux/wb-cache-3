60|$|Sadness {{fell over}} the once happy family of Millbank after the {{departure}} of Coningsby from Hellingsley. When the first pang was over, Edith had found some solace in the sympathy of her aunt, who had always appreciated and admired Coningsby; {{but it was a}} sympathy which aspired only to soften sorrow, and not to create hope. But Lady Wallinger, though she lengthened her visit for the sake of her niece, in time quitted them; and then the name of Coningsby was never heard by Edith. Her brother, shortly after the sorrowful and abrupt departure of his friend, had gone to the factories, where he remained, and of which, in future, it was intended that he should assume the <b>principal</b> <b>direction.</b> Mr. Millbank himself, sustained at first by the society of his friend Sir Joseph, to whom he was attached, and occupied with daily reports from his establishment and the transaction of the affairs with his numerous and busy constituents, was for a while scarcely conscious of the alteration which had taken place in the demeanour of his daughter. But when they were once more alone together, it was impossible any longer to be blind to the great change. That happy and equable gaiety of spirit, which seemed to spring from an innocent enjoyment of existence, and which had ever distinguished Edith, was wanting. Her sunny glance was gone. She was not indeed always moody and dispirited, but she was fitful, unequal in her tone. That temper whose sweetness had been a domestic proverb had become a little uncertain. Not that her affection for her father was diminished, but there were snatches of unusual irritability which momentarily escaped her, followed by bursts of tenderness that were the creatures of compunction. And often, after some hasty word, she would throw her arms round her father's neck with the fondness of remorse. She pursued her usual avocations, for she had really too well-regulated a mind, she was in truth a person of too strong an intellect, to neglect any source of occupation and distraction. Her flowers, her pencil, and her books supplied her with these; and music soothed, and at times beguiled, her agitated thoughts. But there was no joy in the house, and in time Mr. Millbank felt it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Autonomous {{navigation}} in unknown but wellstructured environments (e. g., parking lots) is {{a common}} task for human drivers and an important goal for autonomous vehicles. In such environments, the vehicles must obey the standard conventions of driving (e. g., passing oncoming vehicles on the correct side), but often lack a map {{that can be used}} to guide path planning in an appropriate way. The robots must therefore rely on features of the environment to drive in a safe and predictable way. In this work, we focus on detecting one of such features, the <b>principal</b> <b>directions</b> of the environment. We propose a Markov-random-field (MRF) model for estimating the maximum-likelihood field of <b>principal</b> <b>directions,</b> given the local linear features extracted from the vehicle’s sensor data, and show that the method leads to robust estimates of <b>principal</b> <b>directions</b> in complex real-life driving environments. We also demonstrate how the computed <b>principal</b> <b>directions</b> can be used to guide a path-planning algorithm, leading to the generation of significantly improved trajectories. I...|$|R

25|$|In general, the eigenvectors and {{eigenvalues}} of {{the shape}} operator at each point determine the directions {{in which the}} surface bends at each point.

5000|$|In the {{differential}} geometry of surfaces in three dimensions, umbilics or umbilical points are points on a surface that are locally spherical.

5000|$|Given the <b>principal</b> <b>direction</b> of {{diffusion}} at each {{location in}} the volume, {{it is possible to}} estimate the global pathways of diffusion through a process known as tractography. However, due to the relatively low resolution of diffusion MRI, many of these pathways may cross, kiss or fan at a single location. In this situation, the single <b>principal</b> <b>direction</b> of the diffusion tensor is not an appropriate model for the local diffusion distribution. The most common solution to this problem is to estimate multiple directions of local diffusion using more complex models. These include mixtures of diffusion tensors, Q-ball imaging, diffusion spectrum imaging [...] and fiber orientation distribution functions, which typically require HARDI acquisition with a large number of gradient directions. As with the diffusion tensor, volumes valued with these complex models require special treatment when applying image computing methods, such as registration [...] and segmentation.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{algebraic}} {{classification of}} the Weyl tensor in arbitrary dimension n is recovered {{by means of}} the <b>principal</b> <b>directions</b> of its " superenergy " tensor. This point of view can be helpful in order to compute the Weyl aligned null directions explicitly, and permits to obtain the algebraic type of the Weyl tensor by computing the principal eigenvalue of rank- 2 symmetric future tensors. The algebraic types compatible with states of intrinsic gravitational radiation can then be explored. The underlying ideas are general, so that a classification of arbitrary tensors in general dimension can be achieved. The Petrov classification (e. g. [31, 24, 5]) of 4 -dimensional spacetimes can be reformulated by using the <b>principal</b> <b>directions</b> of the Bel-Robinson tensor. These are the causal vectors whose contraction with the Bel-Robinson tensor vanishes. The underlying ideas go back to [4, 5, 12, 21], are implicit in [24] and were fully exploited in [6] by using spinors. The result follows because the <b>principal</b> <b>directions</b> of the Bel-Robinson tensor coincide with the <b>principal</b> null <b>directions</b> of the Weyl tensor.
