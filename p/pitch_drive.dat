50|$|One {{proposed}} {{method of}} achieving a diametric drive, or possibly a disjunction drive, which was {{studied in the}} BPP was called the <b>pitch</b> <b>drive.</b> This {{has been described as}} involving a hypothetical disjoint field which would eliminate the need for the field to be generated on the spacecraft itself.|$|E

5000|$|After {{funding for}} {{research}} ended, the Project's founder and manager, Marc G. Millis, {{was supported by}} NASA to complete the documentation of results. The culmination of that work is the book, Frontiers of Propulsion Science, {{which was published in}} February 2009, by the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). Chapter 3 (Prerequisites for Space Drive Science) provides refinements and deeper explanation of the following hypothetical [...] "space drive" [...] propulsion methods: diametric drive, <b>pitch</b> <b>drive,</b> bias drive, disjunction drive, and three variations of differential sails.|$|E
50|$|One {{specific}} proposal {{for such a}} <b>pitch</b> <b>drive</b> was called the bias drive. According to this proposal, {{if it were possible}} to locally alter the value of the gravitational constant G in front of and behind the craft, one could create a bias drive. While the gravitational constant is a fundamental physical constant in general relativity, the Brans-Dicke theory of gravitation does in a sense allow for a locally varying gravitational constant, so the notion of a locally varying gravitational constant has been seriously discussed in mainstream physics. It has been claimed that one problem with the concept of a bias drive was that it might create a singularity in the field's gradient located inside the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|We {{undertook}} {{a detailed analysis}} of population spike rate and LFP power in the Zebra finch auditory system. Utilizing the full range of Zebra finch vocalizations and dual-hemisphere multielectrode recordings from auditory neurons, we used encoder models to show how intuitive acoustic features such as amplitude, spectral shape and <b>pitch</b> <b>drive</b> the spike rate of individual neurons and LFP power on electrodes. Using ensemble decoding approaches, we show that these acoustic features can be successfully decoded from the population spike rate vector and the power spectra of the multielectrode LFP with comparable performance. In addition we found that adding pairwise spike synchrony to the spike rate decoder boosts performance above that of the population spike rate alone, or LFP power spectra. We also found that decoder performance grows quickly with the addition of more neurons, but there is notable redundancy in the population code. Finally, we demonstrate that LFP power on an electrode can be well predicted by population spike rate and spike synchrony. High frequency LFP power (80 - 190 Hz) integrates neural activity spatially over a distance of up to 250 microns, while low frequency LFP power (0 - 30 Hz) can integrate neural activity originating up to 800 microns away from the recording electrode. To understand how an auditory system processes complex sounds, it is essential to understand how the temporal envelope of sounds, i. e. the time-varying amplitude, is encoded by neural activity. We studied the temporal envelope of Zebra finch vocalizations, and show that it exhibits modulations in the 0 - 30 Hz range, similar to human speech. We then built linear filter models to predict 0 - 30 Hz LFP activity from the temporal envelopes of vocalizations, achieving surprisingly high performance for electrodes near thalamorecipient areas of Zebra finch auditory cortex. We then show that there are two spatially-distinct subnetworks that resonate at different frequency bands, one subnetwork that resonates around 19 Hz, and another subnetwork that resonates at 14 Hz. These two subnetworks are present in every anatomical region. Finally we show that we can improve predictive performance with recurrent neural network models...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOuter-arm dynein is {{the main}} engine {{providing}} the motive force in cilia. Using three-dimensional tracking microscopy, we found that contrary to previous reports Tetrahymena ciliary three-headed outer-arm dynein (αβγ) as well as proteolytically generated two-headed (βγ) and one-headed (α) subparticles showed clockwise rotation of each sliding microtubule around its longitudinal axis in microtubule corkscrewing assays. By measuring the rotational pitch {{as a function of}} ATP concentration, we also found that the microtubule corkscrewing pitch is independent of ATP concentration, except at low ATP concentrations where the pitch generated by both three-headed αβγ and one-headed α exhibited significantly longer pitch. In contrast, the <b>pitch</b> <b>driven</b> by two-headed βγ did not display this sensitivity. In the assays on lawns containing mixtures of α and βγ at various ratios, the corkscrewing pitch increased dramatically in a nonlinear fashion as the ratio of α in the mixture increased. Even small proportions of α-subparticle could significantly increase the corkscrewing pitch of the mixture. Our data show that torque generation does not require the three-headed outer-arm dynein (αβγ) but is an intrinsic property of the subparticles of axonemal dyneins and also suggest that each subparticle may have distinct mechanical properties...|$|R
