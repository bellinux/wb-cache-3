[...] He came to wider prominence {{in the context of}} the Peaceful Revolution which was followed by German reunification, formally in October 1990. [...] During the second half of the 1980s he had been establishing contacts with underground opposition groups, and after the wall was breached in November 1989 he was able to become a Round Table expert witness on Stasi files. [...] He was also a member of the [...] "Normannenstraße Citizens Committee". He was tasked, together with , with ensuring the <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>files</b> at the Stasi national centre in Normannenstraße as the Stasi operation itself was dissolved. During a period of rapid change, the occupation in January 1990 by concerned citizens (taking their queue from similar actions in Erfurt, Lepizig and Rostock) of the building housing the archives, thwarted a more extensive destruction of the evidence. In March 1990 Wolle and Mitter, using their access to the files, published a first edition of Stasi reports and instructions. 200,000 copies were printed within a few days and by July 1990 250,000 had been produced. [...] The question of what to do with the Stasi archives had become pressing very quickly because of the extent and nature of government surveillance over citizens in East Germany between 1949 and 1989: in March 1990 a more structured approach to the archives began to emerge. Stefan Wolle served as a member of what became known as the Stasi Records Agency ("Bundesbeauftragter für die Stasi-Unterlagen" [...] / BStU / [...] "Gauck commission") between March 1990 and February 1991.|$|E

[...] Fixity checking {{is the process of}} verifying that a digital object has not been altered or corrupted. During transfer, a repository may run a fixity check to ensure a transmitted file has not been altered en route. Within the repository, fixity checking is used to ensure that digital files have not been affected by data rot or other digital preservation dangers. By itself, fixity checking does not ensure the <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> a digital <b>file.</b> Instead, it allows a repository to identify which corrupted files to replace with a clean copy from the producer or from a backup.|$|R
40|$|Since {{its release}} in mid 1993, Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) {{has become a}} widely used {{standard}} for electronic document distribution worldwide in many institutional settings. Much of its popularity comes from its ability to faithfully encode both the text and the visual appearance of source documents, preserving their fonts, formatting, colors, and graphics. PDF files can be viewed, navigated, and printed with a free Adobe Acrobat Reader, available on all major computing platforms. PDF has many applications and is commonly used to publish government, public, and academic documents. Many of the electronic journals and other digital resources acquired by libraries are published in PDF format. As libraries grow more dependent on electronic resources, they need to consider how they can preserve these resources for the long term. Many libraries retain back runs of print journals that are over 100 years old, and which are still consulted by researchers. No digital technology has lasted nearly that long, and many data formats have already become obsolete and not easily readable in a much shorter time period. This document discusses ways that libraries can plan for the <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> electronic journals and other digital resources in PDF format. After a brief discussion <b>of</b> the <b>file</b> specifications and the future plans for PDF, the article focuses on issues related to <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> PDF <b>files...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the choice}} <b>of</b> <b>file</b> formats for <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> text documents, {{there is a}} {{potential}} trade-off between preserving the integrity and usability of documents.

These formats are then compared with Markdown, a relatively new so-called lightweight markup language. It is concluded that no single format is optimal with respect to the trade-off problem, when it comes to preserving typical documents in a modern environment, with more or less complex formatting and document structure. Therefore, the feasiblity of using two or more formats for <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> a single document (e. g. PDF/A combined with Markdown and/or Office OpenXML) is discussed.
