40|$|Nowadays, biker like {{to spend}} their time with the nature such as visiting {{waterfall}} or camping in a jungle where the electric power is not available. This situation have made new technology to be developed such as powerbank and <b>portable</b> <b>lamp.</b> One of the new tachnology {{that have been developed}} is electrical portable water kettle. This device help people to boil the water without using fire as the heater. In this thesis, the portable DC water kettle suitable for motorcycle is designed, developed and tested. This device use 12 v, 5 a battery as it power supply which is directly connect to the source. The reason for choosing this type of battery is because it commonly use by the motorcycle in Malaysia. The kanthal 26 AWG is used as it heating element while the mechanical thermostate will sense the boiled water. The device has been tasted with different length of heating element which are 15 cm, 30 cm and 50 cm corrensponding to resistance value 2. 6 ohm, 5. 0 ohm and 8. 3 ohm respectively. The kanthal is connected to the thermostate by using copper wire. This device can boil 500 ml of water at one times. The device also equiped with autooff sensor to cut the power supply when the water reach at it boiling point. Experiment conducted shows that the most optimal condition is achieved when the device uses kanthal 26 AWG, with resistance is at 5. 0 ohm.

In 1865, Joseph Oldham established a millwright general engineering shop and by 1887 this company was manufacturing machinery for the hat-making industry. Another important industry in the area was coal mining and shortly after 1887 the company began making machinery and equipment for this industry, which included miners' <b>portable</b> <b>lamps.</b> Up to this time, miners had always used the safety lamp devised in 1815 by Sir Humphry Davy (1778–1829) but this new battery-powered Davy lamp eventually replaced the traditional safety lamp.|$|R
5000|$|Today, Hutchinson attracts study {{mainly for}} his {{photographs}} of dancers. As one source points out, “he developed {{a fascination with}} dancers as subjects, cultivating enduring relationships with Anna Pavlova, Adolph Bolm, Ruth Page, and the Pavley-Oukrainsky dance troupe.” Among his most widely reproduced works {{is a series of}} photographs of Anna Pavlova made during 1915 in Chicago during production of the film, “The Dumb Girl of Portici.” [...] While Hutchinson was not the only photographer of the period attracted to dance, his work is distinguished from the product of contemporaries by its lighting. Unlike Arnold Genthe and Maurice Goldberg, for example, Hutchinson rejected one source natural light in his images, relying instead on <b>portable</b> <b>lamps</b> placed in multiple locations.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this program {{was to develop a}} ballast system for plug-in CFLs (compact {{fluorescent}} lamps) that will directly replace standard metal shell, medium base incandescent lampholders (such as Levition No. 6098) for use with <b>portable</b> <b>lamp</b> fixtures, such as floor, table and desk lamps. A secondary goal was to identify a plug-in CFL that is optimized for use with this ballast. This Plug-in CFL Ballastin-a-Socket system will allow fixture manufacturers to easily manufacture CFL-based high-efficacy portable fixtures that provide residential and commercial consumers with attractive, cost-effective, and energy-efficient fixtures for use wherever portable incandescent fixtures are used today. The advantages of this proposed system over existing CFL solutions are that the fixtures can only be used with high-efficacy CFLs, and they will be more attractive and will have lower life-cycle costs than screw-in or adapter-based CFL retrofit solutions. These features should greatly increase the penetration of CFL's into the North American market. Our work has shown that using integrated circuits it is quite feasible to produce a lamp-fixture ballast of a size comparable to the current Edison-screw 3 -way incandescent fixtures. As for price points for BIAS-based fixtures, end-users polled by the Lighting Research Institute at RPI indicated that they would pay as much as an additional $ 10 for a lamp containing such a ballast. The ballast has been optimized to run with a 26 W amalgam triple biax lamp in the base-down position, yet can accept non-amalgam versions of the lamp. With a few part alterations, the ballast can be produced to support 32 W lamps as well. The ballast uses GE's existing L-Comp[1] power topology in the circuit so that the integrated circuit design would be a design that could possibly be used by other CFL and EFL products with minor modifications. This gives added value by reducing cost and size of not only the BIAS, but also possibly other integral CFL and future dimmable integral and plug-in versions of the EFL products...|$|E
50|$|Modern {{inverters}} for <b>portable</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> do {{not rely}} on electromechanical and electromagnetic vibrating switching contacts to produce the required current interruptions in the transformer’s primary winding that are {{required in order to}} produce the induced high voltages in the transformer's secondary winding, as occurs in Ruhmkorff coils; instead, the primary circuit of the transformer is switched by means of one or two transistors oscillating at frequencies of tens or even hundreds of thousand cycles per second, which results in smaller and lighter devices having a very good efficiency in lumens/watt for a given battery consumption or a longer battery charge life for a given light flux when compared with incandescent lamps. Additionally, such high frequencies virtually eliminates the stroboscopic effect which is very noticeable in those cases when tubes are powered by means of low frequency alternating or pulsating currents as happens when regular 50 or 60 Hz AC mains are used as power source. Transistorized devices are also silent, unlike true Ruhmkorff coils, which make its characteristic buzzing noises when in action, even if they are contained in closed casings or boxes. Indeed, the principle of modern fluorescent <b>portable</b> <b>lamps</b> or lanterns remains the same as in Dumas and Benoit's original mining electric lamp.|$|R

50|$|The T-18's chassis and {{suspension}} was improved {{from the}} T-16 {{by the addition}} of an extra support roller and an independent vertical spring suspension. The 300 mm track of the T-16 was transferred over to the T-18, with some improvements. The engine, a vertical, four-cylinder MS engine, was designed and improved upon by Alexander Mikulin. The engine was capable of a maximum of 35 horsepower. The MS engine was combined with the PSC transmission in one unit rather than being in two separate housings. The PSC transmission gave the tank four forward speeds and one reverse speed. The engine-transmission compartment in the back let air in via holes drilled in the rear plate. This improved protection, but also led to the engine overheating. Electrical equipment included a 6-volt battery, magneto and dynamo, which fed the lamp, horn, rear light, light distribution panel and two <b>portable</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R

50|$|The smallest, often {{portable}} {{photovoltaic systems}} are called pico solar PV systems, or pico solar. They mostly combine a rechargeable battery and charge controller, {{with a very}} small PV panel. The panel's nominal capacity {{is just a few}} watt-peak (1-10 Wp) and its area less than a tenth of a square meter, or one square foot, in size. A large range of different applications can be solar powered such as music players, fans, <b>portable</b> <b>lamps,</b> security lights, solar lighting kits, solar lanterns and street light (see below), phone chargers, radios, or even small, seven-inch LCD televisions, that run on less than ten watts. As it is the case for power generation from pico hydro, pico PV systems are useful in small, rural communities that require only a small amount of electricity. Since the efficiency of many appliances have improved considerably, in particular due to the usage of LED lights and efficient rechargeable batteries, pico solar has become an affordable alternative, especially in the developing world. The metric prefix pico- stands for a trillionth to indicate the smallness of the system's electric power.|$|R

The applied methodology uses the chi-square distribution, in order to obtain the number of devices to be used and test duration. A supervisory failure electronic circuit was constructed to determine life-time of the LED devices. The circuit is a multiplexer and PIC microcontroller based. Multiplexers increase the inputs in which LED's are recorded, i. e. are part of the circuit that selects the device; the PIC is programmed to determine the life-time in hours and to determine exactly which device failed. This provides a reliability analysis tool that allows performance studies of LED's. This technology could be easily extended to other electronic devices in order to improve their qualit...|$|R

5000|$|This lamp {{could be}} {{considered}} as a predecessor of modern fluorescent lanterns, because, as in the [...] "Ruhmkorff lamp", modern <b>portable</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> use an inverter (oscillator + step-up transformer) to convert low voltage DC current from dry cells or storage batteries into AC or even pulsating current at a voltage high enough as to ionize the gas in the fluorescent tube and thus power it at the required nominal level. Modern <b>portable</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> contains neither nitrogen, nor C02, nor uranium glass; instead a modern fluorescent tube is filled with argon at a very low pressure, along with a few milligrams of mercury. The lamp electrodes usually consists of a double or triply coiled tungsten wire covered with substances, such as alkaline metal oxides, that readily emits free electrons, aiding the ionization of the gas and thereby initiating and sustaining the electric arc. The inner walls of the tube are coated with a thin layer of fluorescent substances, which, when they are excited by the 253.7 nm line of UV radiation from a mercury arc, emits visible light, usually in the range of 6500K (daylight) colour temperature. The spectral characteristics (coloration) of such a light depends entirely on the chemical nature of those [...] "phosphors".|$|R
