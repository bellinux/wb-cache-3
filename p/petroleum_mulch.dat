40|$|The {{effects of}} {{petroleum}} mulches on the emergence and yield of tomatoes were {{studied at the}} Farmington Field Station, Greenville Field Station, North Logan, and the greenhouse. The mulches were applied as surface overlays above the seed or incorporating before plantin. Seedling emergence and yields were measured. Data recorded from trials conducted under cool weather conditions indicated that <b>petroleum</b> <b>mulch</b> overlays can be effective in increasing seedling emergence. The increased seedling emergence with <b>petroleum</b> <b>mulch</b> is due to increased soil temperature, less moisture loss from the surface, and a minimum of soil crust formation...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 <b>Petroleum</b> <b>mulch</b> applied on {{the soil}} surface over a row of planted seeds {{promotes}} a more rapid and a more uniform germination of seeds, enhances elongation of seedlings {{and in some cases}} increases the yield of the crop. The beneficial effects of <b>petroleum</b> <b>mulch</b> have usually been attributed to increased soil temperatures below the mulch. Some reports have pointed out that evaporation of soil water is reduced {{as a result of the}} mulch application. An experimental arrangement was designed so that changes in soil temperature and soil water content of mulched and unmulched soil, subjected to the same radiation load could be measured under controlled conditions. Soil at a pre-determined water content was packed into boxes with inside dimensions of 4. 0 x 40. 0 x 48. 0 cm. A ten cm wide band of mulch was applied to one side of the slab leaving 30 cm of bare soil. The soil was subjected to a temperature cycle by turning on infra-red heat lamps at 8 : 00 A. M., increasing the energy output at hourly intervals with a variable transformer until 2 : 00 P. M. and then decreasing the energy output until the lights were turned off at 8 : 00 P. M. Soil temperatures were measured at two-hour intervals with calibrated thermistors inserted into the soil slab. Soil water content changes at selected points were measured at regular intervals with a collimated gamma-beam, movable in a vertical as well as a horizontal direction. The heat flux into the soil was measured with heat flux discs. It was observed that an application of <b>petroleum</b> <b>mulch,</b> changes the temperature and water regime of a soil. The mulch covered soil was about 5 Â°C warmer than the bare soil at the time the soil temperatures attained their maximum value. At all other times the temperature difference between mulched and bare soil was smaller. The bare soil rapidly lost water in the upper four centimeters. The mulch covered soil lost water in the upper cm of soil but gained water at depths below this zone. This gain in water was observed in the zone where seedlings are normally placed, indicating that the beneficial effect of <b>petroleum</b> <b>mulch</b> on germination and seedling growth must be attributed to improved soil water conditions as well as to improved soil temperature conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>petroleum</b> <b>mulches</b> on plant {{response}} to herbicides were {{studied at the}} Farmington Field Station. The herbicides were applied to the soil preemergent and by incorporation at one-half, normal and double the recommended rates with asphalt overlay. The herbicides and crops used were : Atrazine and Ramrod on sweet corn, PEBC and Diphenamid on tomatoes and EPTC and Trifluralin on snap beans. Germination, overall crop rating, grass and broad leafed weed control and yields were measured. Data recorded from these trials showed that herbicides are as effective under the asphalt when compared to plots with herbicide but no asphalt. Considering all herbicides and conditions, overall crop growth and weed control were not increased or decreased by the asphalt mulch. Germination and yield were not affected by the interaction of herbicides with the asphalt overlay on the three crops...|$|R
