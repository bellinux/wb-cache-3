Hoosiers also helped Abraham Lincoln win the presidency in the 1860 election and {{voted in favor}} of his re-election in 1864. Although Lincoln won only 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country's <b>popular</b> vote in <b>the</b> U.S. presidential election in 1860, he earned Indiana's 13 electoral votes with 51.09 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> its popular vote, compared to Stephen Douglas's 42.44 percent, John Breckenridge's 4.52 percent, and John Bell's 1.95 percent.

5|$|However, {{because of}} {{political}} infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley {{was no match for}} Grant, who won in a landslide. Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes, and received 55.8 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> vote nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both house of Congress.

5|$|In 1968, Richard Nixon, the United States Republican Party nominee, won {{the presidential}} election, {{defeating}} Democrat Hubert Humphrey by seven-tenths of a <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> vote. Nixon appointed H. R. Haldeman as his Chief of Staff; this position granted Haldeman {{a relatively large}} degree {{of control over the}} activities of the presidential administration. Haldeman had first worked for Nixon in 1956, during Nixon's successful bid for the vice-presidency under Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|E

As of early October, Rice had spent nearly $120,000 on his re-election campaign, the second-highest level of spending among all Colorado House of Representatives candidates. Rice's re-election bid was endorsed by the Denver Post, and he ultimately won with 54 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> vote.|$|E

5|$|The Greenbackers {{nominated}} Weaver {{for president}} in 1880, but he received only 3.3 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> vote. After several more attempts at elected office, he was again elected to the House in 1884 and 1886. In Congress, he worked for expansion of the money supply and {{for the opening of}} Indian Territory to white settlement. As the Greenback Party fell apart, a new anti-big business third party, the People's Party ("Populists"), arose. Weaver helped to organize the party and was their nominee {{for president in}} 1892. This time he was more successful and gained 8.5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> vote and won five states, but still fell far short of victory. The Populists merged with the Democrats {{by the end of the}} 19th century, and Weaver went with them, promoting the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896, 1900, and 1908. After serving as mayor of his home town, Colfax, Iowa, Weaver retired from his pursuit of elective office. He died in Iowa in 1912. Most of Weaver's political goals remained unfulfilled at his death, but many came to pass in the following decades.|$|E

After NES data are reweighted to correct for turnout and vote choice errors, macropartisanship {{is found to be}} more stable, to be less sensitive to short-term political conditions, and to have shifted more in the Republican direction in the early 1980 s. <b>The</b> strength <b>of</b> partisanship also declined a bit more in the 1970 s and rebounded a bit less in recent years than the uncorrected NES data indicate.

Three Liberal incumbents, as well as NDP leader Lorraine Michael, successfully held their seats. Notably, however, Liberal leader Gerry Reid was not reelected in his own district.

Tyler predicted the Whigs would easily take Virginia; he was embarrassed when he was proved wrong, but was consoled by an overall victory—Harrison and Tyler won by an electoral vote of 234–60 and with 53 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> vote. Van Buren took only seven scattered states out of 26. The Whigs gained control of both houses of Congress.|$|E

Many voters decided the NSDAP was capable of restoring order, quelling civil unrest and improving Germany's international reputation.

McCain delivered his concession speech at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona at about 11:20 pm EST. In the end, McCain won 173 electoral college votes to Obama's 365, reflecting McCain's failure to win the key battleground states of Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and the Democratic Party's upset victories in traditional Republican strongholds such as Virginia, North Carolina, and Indiana.

After the longest {{convention}} in the party's history, the divided Republicans chose another Ohioan, Representative James A. Garfield, as their standard-bearer. The Democratic Party chose General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania as their nominee. The dominance {{of the two major}} parties began to fray as an upstart left-wing party, the Greenback Party, nominated another Civil War general for president, Iowa Congressman James B. Weaver. In a campaign fought mainly over issues of Civil War loyalties, tariffs, and Chinese immigration, Garfield and Hancock each took just over 48 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> vote. Weaver and two other minor candidates, Neal Dow and John W. Phelps, together made up the remaining percentage.

In the fall of 2009 Danielle Smith was elected as leader and by December the Wildrose was leading provincial opinion polls ahead of both the governing PCs and the opposition Liberals.

He dropped out in July 1992 amid controversy, but re-entered in October, participating {{in all three}} presidential debates. Despite an aggressive use of campaign infomercials on prime time network television, his polling numbers never fully recovered from his initial exit. On Election Day, Perot appeared on every state ballot {{as a result of}} the earlier draft efforts.

Federal prosecution of the Klan, a strong economy, debt reduction, lowered tariffs, repeal of the income tax, and civil service reforms helped Grant defeat Greeley. Grant won 56 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> vote and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66. A majority of African Americans in the South voted for Grant, while Democratic opposition remained mostly peaceful. Grant lost in six former slave states that wanted to see an end to Reconstruction. In 1873 Wilson suffered a stroke; never fully recovering, he died in office on November 22, 1875. With Wilson's loss, Grant relied on Fish's guidance more than ever.|$|E

Willkie received 45 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> vote to Roosevelt's 55 percent. The president received 27.2 million votes to Willkie's 22.3 million, and won 449 to 82 in the Electoral College.
