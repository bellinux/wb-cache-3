40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we want to}} explore the {{prospects}} for a physics of information. In the first chapter we will summarise the present situation. Chapter 2 demonstrates the present limitations of information processing. Chapter 3 suggests, that these practical limitations might be traced back to limitations in the underlying theoretical concepts. Chapter 4 suggests a more physics oriented way of defining concepts like “program ” or “complexity”. Chapter 5 explores, whether the concepts discussed in chapter 4 {{can be applied to the}} processing of <b>physical</b> <b>messages,</b> for instance video images. In a first step in chapter 5. 1 we note a difference between messages in information theory and <b>physical</b> <b>messages</b> – <b>physical</b> <b>messages</b> can always be finite. In chapter 5. 2 we note, that messages can be considered vectors and that already this very simple statement is leading to relevant practical consequences, leading to a new type of OTP cipher. Chapter 5. 3 discusses some general mathematical properties of vector spaces and creates a connection between the mathematical concepts and the physical observables (measurement). In chapter 5. 4 we try to gain first hints, of how the mathematical structure of the visible world might be used in order to calculate the description of an image to mathematical precision. 1) Information Theory and Physics: the present situatio...|$|R

40|$|In {{message passing}} environments, the message send time is {{dominated}} by overheads that are relatively independent of the message size. Therefore, fine-grained applications (such as Time-Warp simulators) suffer high overheads because of frequent communication. In this paper, we investigate the optimization of the communication subsystem of Time-Warp simulators using dynamic message aggregation. Under this scheme, Time-Warp messages with the same destination LP, occuring in close temporal proximity are dynamically aggregated and sent as a single <b>physical</b> <b>message.</b> Several aggregation strategies that attempt to minimize the communication overhead without harming {{the progress of the}} simulation (because of messages being delayed) are developed.

The concurrency may be viewed at the logical level in the application {{rather than at the}} <b>physical</b> <b>message</b> communication level. The concurrency has a direct relationship to the message delivery performance in the underlying computation such as asynchronism in message delivery protocols. The paper quantitatively analyzes how the application level concurrency influences the execution of the application. The analysis is based on methods for representing concurrency and deriving measures of concurrency from the representations. System level execution models based on ISIS, x-Kernel and our causal broadcast communication system are used as case studies in the analysis.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{overview}} of the AMIS (Automated Methods for Integrating Systems) project approach to systems integration. The objective of the AMIS project is to reduce the cost and time for software integration by devising methods, algorithms, and tools by which activities of a systems engineer can be automated. The motivation for this work is to reduce the expense of integration efforts where traditional standards-based approaches are inappropriate or ineffective, e. g., where {{the time it takes to}} develop a standard is longer than the life of the integration problem. The anticipated benefits of this project include: improving interface/service specifications, improving knowledge capture for existing software systems and standards, reducing the time and cost of systems integration projects, identifying the unsolved problems, and providing knowledge for new toolkits. The AMIS approach is based on the idea that the published interface specifications for a software system can be abstracted into an understanding of the roles in the business processes the system was built to support. Those roles can be formalized into specifications and models for interactions in which each element will be associated with the corresponding business action/entity/property notion. When an engineer devises new processes, software may be able to match existing role definitions for component systems and implement those roles along with any needed choreography and process-specific wrappers that transform the <b>physical</b> <b>message</b> sequences on the basis of equivalent business notions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To motivate {{individuals}} {{to adhere to}} a regular physical activity regime, guidelines must be supplemented with persuasive messages that are disseminated widely. While substantial research has examined effective strategies for disseminating <b>physical</b> activity <b>messages,</b> {{there has been no}} systematic effort to examine optimal message content. This paper reviews studies that evaluate the effectiveness of three approaches for constructing <b>physical</b> activity <b>messages</b> including tailoring messages to suit individual characteristics of message recipients (message tailoring), framing messages in terms of gains versus losses (message framing), and targeting messages to affect change in self-efficacy (i. e., a theoretical determinant of behavior change). Methods We searched the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE and CINAHL databases up to July 2008. Relevant reference lists also were searched. We included intervention trials, field experiments, and laboratory-based studies that aimed to test the efficacy or effectiveness of tailored messages, framed messages and self-efficacy change messages among healthy adults. We used a descriptive approach to analyze emerging patterns in research findings. Based on this evidence we made recommendations for practice and future research. Results Twenty-two studies were identified. Twelve studies evaluated message tailoring. In 10 of these studies, tailored messages resulted in greater physical activity than a control message. Six studies evaluated framed messages. Five of these studies demonstrated that gain-framed messages lead to stronger intentions to be active compared to a control message. Moreover, a gain-frame advantage was evident in three of the four studies that assessed physical activity. Four studies evaluated self-efficacy change messages. The two studies that used an experimental design provide a clear indication that individuals' beliefs can be affected by messages that incorporate types of information known to be determinants of self-efficacy. Overall, strong evidence to support definitive recommendations for optimal message content and structure was lacking. Conclusions Additional research testing the optimal content of messages used to supplement physical activity guidelines is needed. Tailored messages, gain-framed messages, and self-efficacy change messages hold promise as strategies for constructing <b>physical</b> activity <b>messages</b> and should be a focus of future research. </p...|$|R
