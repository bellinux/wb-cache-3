5|$|The {{implementation}} of a uniform civil code for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985–86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim {{woman who had been}} divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (<b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged that the fundamental right of equality for all citizens irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing the issue as a prime example of the poor {{implementation of}} Fundamental Rights.|$|E

However, he was himself inactive politically, and later stated that he had grown disillusioned with politics.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{examine how the}} <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> creditors' <b>rights</b> {{influence}} {{the way in which}} foreign bank entry affects the access to credit of firms. Using a sample of more than 6000 firms in 22 transition countries I find that as bankruptcy proceedings become more inefficient foreign bank entry is more likely to crowd-out small and opaque firms. Conversely, as the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> creditors' <b>rights</b> improve, the positive association between foreign banks and firms' credit constraints diminishes. These results are robust to controls for endogeneity of foreign banks. The interaction of foreign banks and the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> creditors <b>rights</b> would explain the disparity of results obtained by previous studies: In countries with an adequate <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> creditor <b>rights</b> foreign bank entry may benefit all firms; By contrast, in countries with weak <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> creditor <b>rights</b> foreign bank entry is likely to result in a credit crunch.

500|$|An {{effect of}} the Civil War and {{resulting}} Commonwealth of England, particularly the [...] "liberal" [...] values and feelings it stirred up, was the continuous modernisation and improvement of the common law courts, something that reduced the interference of the Lord Chancellor in common law matters, except in areas where they had wildly divergent principles and law. Under Charles II, for the first time, there was a type of common law appeal where {{the nature of the}} evidence in the initial trial was taken into account, which reduced the {{need to go to the}} Court of Chancery. As a result, the nature of the Court of Chancery changed; rather than being a major corrective system for the common law, it became primarily concerned with the administration and <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> as opposed to the common law courts, which were mainly concerned with the remedy and retribution of problems. This was further enforced by the Statute of Frauds, which confirmed Chancery principles across the board, allowing people to receive the same treatment in the common law courts as they did in the Chancery.|$|E
500|$|The Hindu and Muslim {{communities}} in India were treated differently {{by the government}} in that separate types of concessions were made for each community in order to accommodate their separate religious laws and regulations. The case of Shah Bano begun in 1985 was one such example of Rajiv Gandhi attempting to make [...] "concessions" [...] for the Muslim community to in turn secure support for the Congress. Shah Bano, a 73-year-old Muslim woman, was divorced by her husband after forty-three years of marriage. According to the Sharia or Muslim Law, her husband was not required to pay her alimony. Shah Bano challenged this decision in the Supreme Court, which ultimately ruled in her favour and ordered her husband to pay her a monthly maintenance allowance. This caused chaos amongst the Muslim clerics who denounced the judgement and suggested that their religion, Islam was under attack in the country. In a fear of losing overall Muslim support, Rajiv succumbed to the pressures of the Conservative Moulvis from Muslims community and his own party and backed the Muslim Women (<b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> on Divorce) Bill which restricts alimony for Muslim Women only for 90 days after divorce. This caused an outcry from Muslim feminists and Hindu nationalists who found the appeasement of Muslim males by the Congress for political purposes wrong and opportunistic.|$|E

In 1986, the Parliament of India passed The Muslim Women (<b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> on Divorce) Act 1986, which nullified the Supreme Court's judgment in the Shah Bano case. The Act diluted the Supreme Court judgment and allowed maintenance payments to divorced women only {{during the period of}} Iddah, or until 90 days after the divorce, according to the provisions of Islamic law.

It therefore disabuses the notion of psyche as uniquely human and throws into question the power differential that permits the sacrifice of animal objectification. Denying animals their full status as psychological beings is understood as a belief that abets animal exploitation.
