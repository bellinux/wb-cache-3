Tunicate 1 (Tu 1) is a dominant <b>pod</b> <b>corn</b> mutation in which kernels are completely enclosed in leaflike glumes.

Both genes are further duplicated, accounting for classical derivative alleles isolated by recombination, and Tu 1 transgenes interact with these derivative alleles in a dose-dependent manner. In young ear primordia, TU 1 proteins are nuclearly localized in specific cells {{at the base of}} spikelet pair meristems. Tu 1 branch determination defects resemble those in ramosa mutants, which encode regulatory proteins expressed in these same cells, accounting for synergism in double mutants discovered almost 100 years ago.

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the uranium concentrations in different vegetable foodstuffs and grown in agricultural soils, which are then consumed by the residents of the village of Cunha Baixa (Portugal),—located in an former uranium mining area. This study was conducted to address concerns expressed by the local farmers as well as to provide data for uranium-related health risk assessments for the area.

Twenty-onesamples of 7 feedstuffs from agricultural and food industry by-products consisted of corn straw, potatostraw, rice straw, cocoa pod, sago waste, rice bran, soybean curd residue were evaluated by an in vitro gasproduction and nutrient degradability. The feedstuffs varied greatly in their crude protein (CP), neutraldetergent fiber (NDF) and non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) contents. Crude protein ranged from 1. 5 to 21. 8 %,NDF from 31. 6 to 71. 1 % and NFC from 1. 5 to 50. 8 %. Among the seven feedstuffs, soybean curd residuehad the highest CP content, on the other hand it had the lowest NDF content. Dry matter (DM) and organicmatter (OM) degradability were highest (P< 0. 01) in soybean curd residue among the feedstuffs. The CH 4 production was significantly higher (P< 0. 01) in rice straw, cocoa <b>pod</b> and <b>corn</b> straw as compared to sagowaste.

Considerable has been made in developing genetic linkage maps of chickpea, cowpea, and soybean, while much remains to be done in pigeonpea, beans, lentil, and fieldpea. Preliminary identification of molecular markers resistance to insects in soybean, chickpea, mungbean, fieldpea, and cowpea has been reported. However, no distinct advantage has been observed by using assisted selection resistance to insect pests over the conventional approach, and in most cases, the epistatic are also quite high. Thus, a new paradigm approach may be required to combine conventional approaches and marker-assisted selection in such way as to create systems better than either approach.
