She graduated senior high school and entered technical school in Tokyo. She received fluticasone (400 μg daily) but exacerbation continued after she became an office clerk. She returned Kurashiki in October 2001 but had wheeze and asthma exacerbations. She was admitted to our hospital for evaluation and treatment of bronchial asthma on August 2, 2002. After admission, her symptoms subsided within some days. She was treated with montelukast and <b>perilla</b> <b>seed</b> oil-rich supplementation. The number of eosinophils decreased, decrease was observed in leukotriene (LT) B 4 generation and in LTC 4 generation, and pulmonary function improved following montelukast and <b>perilla</b> <b>seed</b> oil-rich supplementation for 4 weeks. The patient had no exacerbation under treatment and was discharged from the hospital on September 2, 2002. For some patients with persistent asthma, inhaled corticosteroids may fail to achieve adequate control possibly because corticosteroids do not completely inhibit the synthesis and release of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) in the lung. Montelukast blocks the interaction of cysLTs with their receptor and resulting downstream events and <b>perilla</b> <b>seed</b> oil-rich diet suppresses LT generation. Combination therapy with montelukast and <b>perilla</b> <b>seed</b> oil-rich diet {{is more effective than}} montelukast or <b>perilla</b> <b>seed</b> oil-rich diet alone because of additive effects of montelukast with <b>perilla</b> <b>seed</b> oil-rich diet.

Previous reports on RNA-seq of <b>perilla</b> <b>seed</b> had identified fatty acid (FA) and triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis genes, but the underlying mechanism of ALA biosynthesis and its regulation {{still need to be}} further explored. So we conducted Illumina RNA-sequencing in seven temporal developmental stages of perilla seeds. Sequencing generated a total of 127 million clean reads, containing 15. 88 Gb of valid data. The de novo assembly of sequence reads yielded 64, 156 unigenes with an average length of 777 bp. A total of 39, 760 unigenes were annotated and 11, 693 unigenes were found to be differentially expressed in all samples. According to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, 486 unigenes were annotated in the “lipid metabolism” pathway. Of these, 150 unigenes were found to be involved in fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis and triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly in perilla seeds. A coexpression analysis showed that a total of 104 genes were highly coexpressed (r > 0. 95). The coexpression network could be divided into two main subnetworks showing over expression in the medium or earlier and late phases, respectively. In order to identify the putative regulatory genes, a transcription factor (TF) analysis was performed. This led to the identification of 45 gene families, mainly including the AP 2 -EREBP, bHLH, MYB, and NAC families, etc. After coexpression analysis of TFs with highly expression of FAD 2 and FAD 3 genes, 162 TFs were found to be significantly associated with two FAD genes (r > 0. 95). Those TFs were predicted to be the key regulatory factors in ALA biosynthesis in <b>perilla</b> <b>seed.</b> The qRT-PCR analysis also verified the relevance of expression pattern between two FAD genes and partial candidate TFs. Although {{it has been reported that}} some TFs are involved in seed development, more direct evidence is still needed to verify their function. However, these findings can provide clues to reveal the possible molecular mechanisms of ALA biosynthesis and its regulation in <b>perilla</b> <b>seed...</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{its natural}} state, the yield of perilla is not high. If the stem is cut about 5 cm {{above ground level}} in summer, a new stalk grows and it {{produces}} more fruit. Leaves can be harvested from the stem that cut off in summer, {{as well as from}} the new stalk and its branches, throughout summer and autumn. The seeds are harvested in autumn when the fruits are ripe. To collect <b>perilla</b> <b>seeds,</b> the whole plant is harvested and the seeds are beat out of the plant, before being spread for sun drying.|$|R

40|$|N- 3 fatty acids, such as fish oil, {{have been}} {{reported}} to have some beneficial effects in patients with bronchial asthma by suppressing leukocyte function, followed by reduction of the need for pharmacologic agents. To examine the effects of dietary supplementation with <b>perilla</b> <b>seed</b> oil rich in α-linolenic acid (ALA), 23 patients with　asthma took corn oil rich in linoleic acid (LA) for the former two weeks, <b>perilla</b> <b>seed</b> oil for the later two weeks. The asthmatic patients were classified into two groups by the changes of the generation of leukotrienes B 4 (LTB 4), C 4 (LTC 4), and B 5 (LTB 5) during the two courses of dietary modification: one was sensitive to dietary modification, and the other was insensitive to dietary supplementation. We compared the two groups in clinical characteristics. Significant differences were observed in peak flow (PEF), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1. 0), IgE, sex, obesity index (OI), concentration of serum total cholesterol, albumin, low density lipoprotein {LDL) -cholesterol, β-lipoprotein and phospholipids between two groups. This study indicated that these factors influence the generation of LTB 4, C 4 and B 5 of asthmatic patients in dietary supplementation. 気道への炎症性白血球の集合が気管支喘息の病態に関わっている。魚油などのn- 3 系脂肪酸が白血球の機能を抑制することにより気管支喘息患者に良好な効果をもたらし,薬剤の必要性を減じたとの報告がなされている｡α-リレノン酸を豊富に含有するエゴマ油食の効果を調べるため,気管支喘息患者 23 名に 2 コースの食事-リノール酸の豊富なコーン油食を 2 週間摂取後,エゴマ油食を 2 週間-を摂取してもらった｡喘息患者は 2 コースの食事間のロイコトリエンB 4 (LTB 4),CA(LTC 4),B 5 (LTB 5) の変化から 2 群- 1 群は食事に対し感受性のある群,もう 1 つは感受性の無い群-に分類した｡我々はこの 2 群を臨床的に検討したところ,ピークフロー(PEF), 1 秒量(FEV 10),IgE,性別,肥満率(OⅠ),血清総コレステロール,アルブミン,低比重リポ蛋白(LDL) -コレステロール,β-リポ蛋白,リン脂質において 2 群間に有意差が認められた｡今回の研究から,これらの因子が,喘息患者において,LTB 4,LTC 4,LTB 5 の産生に対する食事療法の効果に影響を及ぼしていることが示唆された...|$|E

40|$|Perilla or Nga-Kee-Mon (Perilla frutescens) seed {{has long}} been known as a rich source of α-linolenic acid (18 : 3, n- 3). It is widely {{cultivated}} throughout Thailand. However, there are no data on the variation of lipid and fatty acid compositions among crops from different regions. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the compositions of lipids and fatty acids in Thai <b>perilla</b> <b>seed</b> grown at different locations. Two different perilla seeds were harvested from Maehongsorn and Chiang Mai districts, and one commercial perilla was purchased from local market. Seeds were ground, lipid was extracted with chloroform: methanol (2 : 1, v/v) and its composition determined by Iatroscan (TLC/FID). Fatty acid composition was analyzed with GLC using standard methods. Lipid content was between 34 - 36 % (w/w). Triacylglycerol was a predominant lipid in <b>perilla</b> <b>seed</b> (97 % of total lipids), and a minor component was phytosterol (3 % of total lipids). The ratio of saturates: monounsaturates: polyunsaturates was approximately 1 : 1 : 8. Most predominant fatty acid was α-linolenic acid (18 : 3, n- 3) (55 - 60 % of total fatty acid). Seeds from Maehongsorn district had the highest concentration of α-linolenic acid, and commercial perilla had the lowest (P< 0. 05). Other two predominant fatty acids were linoleic acid (18 : 2, n- 6) (18 - 22 % of total fatty acid) and oleic acid (18 : 1) (11 - 13 % of total fatty acid). The results showed that the compositions of lipids and fatty acids in Thai perilla seeds varied significantly among samples from different locations...|$|E
