5|$|In about 1840, L. decemlineata {{adopted the}} {{cultivated}} potato into its host range and it rapidly became a most destructive pest of potato crops. They are today {{considered to be}} the most important insect defoliator of potatoes. They may also cause significant damage to tomato and eggplant crops with both adults and larvae feeding on the plant's foliage. Larvae may defoliate <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> resulting in yield losses of up to 100% if the damage occurs prior to tuber formation. Larvae may consume 40cm2 of potato leaves during the entire larval stage, but adults are capable of consuming 10cm2 of foliage per day.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} beetle have evolved {{immunity}} to insecticides. For example, the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a destructive pest of <b>potato</b> <b>plants.</b> Its hosts include {{other members of}} the Solanaceae, such as nightshade, tomato, eggplant and capsicum, as well as the potato. Different populations have between them developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide. The Colorado potato beetle was evaluated as a tool of entomological warfare during World War II, the idea being to use the beetle and its larvae to damage the crops of enemy nations. Germany tested its Colorado potato beetle weaponisation program south of Frankfurt, releasing 54,000 beetles.|$|E
25|$|Insects that {{commonly}} transmit potato diseases {{or damage}} the plants include the Colorado potato beetle, the potato tuber moth, the {{green peach aphid}} (Myzus persicae), the potato aphid, beet leafhoppers, thrips, and mites. The potato cyst nematode is a microscopic worm that thrives on the roots, thus causing the <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> to wilt. Since its eggs can survive in the soil for several years, crop rotation is recommended.|$|E

25|$|The potato was {{introduced}} to Ireland as a garden crop of the gentry. By the late 17th century, it had become widespread as a supplementary rather than a principal food because the main diet still revolved around butter, milk, and grain products. However, {{in the first two}} decades of the 18th century, it became a base food of the poor, especially in winter. Furthermore, a disproportionate share of the potatoes grown in Ireland were of a single variety, the Irish Lumper. The expansion of the economy between 1760 and 1815 saw the potato make inroads into the diet of the people and become a staple food year round for farmers. The large dependency on this single crop, and the lack of genetic variability among the <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> in Ireland, were two of the reasons why the emergence of Phytophthora infestans had such devastating effects in Ireland and less severe effects elsewhere in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Potato</b> <b>plants</b> are {{herbaceous}} perennials that grow about [...] high, depending on variety, with the leaves dying back after flowering, fruiting and tuber formation. They bear white, pink, red, blue, or purple flowers with yellow stamens. In general, the tubers of varieties with white flowers have white skins, while those of varieties with colored flowers {{tend to have}} pinkish skins. Potatoes are mostly cross-pollinated by insects such as bumblebees, which carry pollen from other <b>potato</b> <b>plants,</b> though {{a substantial amount of}} self-fertilizing occurs as well. Tubers form in response to decreasing day length, although this tendency has been minimized in commercial varieties.|$|E

2500|$|After flowering, <b>potato</b> <b>plants</b> produce {{small green}} fruits that {{resemble}} green cherry tomatoes, each containing about 300 seeds.

New varieties grown from seed can be propagated vegetatively by planting tubers, pieces of tubers cut to include at least one or two eyes, or cuttings, a practice used in greenhouses for the production of healthy seed tubers. Plants propagated from tubers are clones of the parent, whereas those propagated from seed produce a range of different varieties.|$|E

40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi (AMF) and Trichoderma spp. are {{soil microorganisms}} that increase growth and improve a/biotic stress resistance of numerous crop plants. So far, most studies on potato were conducted under greenhouse or in vitro conditions and few reported on results within the field. Therefore, the {{objective was to}} investigate the impact on potato yield of the co-inoculation of R. irregularis MUCL 41833 and T. harzianum MUCL 29707 applied to a cover crop (i. e. Medicago sativa) preceding <b>potato</b> <b>planting</b> or to <b>potato</b> at <b>planting.</b> Two macroplot trials were set up over two growing seasons with the cultivars Sarpo Mira and Bionta, respectively. In both trials, individual subplots were arranged in a randomized complete block design replicated four times. Microbial inoculants were entrapped in alginate beads. Four treatments were considered: inoculum applied to the cover crop preceding <b>potato</b> <b>planting</b> (I+CC+), inoculum applied on <b>potato</b> at <b>planting</b> and absence of a preceding cover crop â€“ i. e. bare soil â€“ (I+CCâˆ’), no inoculum applied either at cover crop preceding <b>potato</b> <b>planting</b> or on <b>potato</b> at <b>planting</b> (Iâˆ’CC+), no inoculum applied on <b>potato</b> at <b>planting</b> and absence of a preceding cover crop â€“ i. e. bare soil â€“ (Iâˆ’CCâˆ’). Potato yield (i. e. tuber weight, size and number) was evaluated in both trials. Potato root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and abundance of Trichoderma harzianum in soil were evaluated in trial 2. In both trials, the most advantageous strategy to increase potato tuber weight was by inoculating the cover crop. For cultivar Sarpo Mira (trial 1) inoculation increased significantly (P 30 mm long. Total root colonization by AMF and% arbuscules in potato roots was increased significantly (P < 0. 001) following inoculation but seemed not influenced by cover crop alone (i. e. without inoculation).
