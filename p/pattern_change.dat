To help modify their sense of entitlement and self-centeredness schema, the strategy is to help them identify how to utilize their unique talents and to help others for reasons other than their own personal gain. This is not so much to change their self-perception of their [...] "entitlement" [...] feeling but more to help them empathize with others. Another type of treatment would be temperament change. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy may be effective in treating NPD, but therapists must recognize the patient's traits and use caution in tearing down narcissistic defenses too quickly. Anger, rage, impulsivity, and impatience can be worked on with skill training. Therapy may not be effective because patients may receive feedback poorly and defensively. Anxiety disorders and somatoform dysfunctions are prevalent but the most common would be depression.|$|E

50|$|A {{well known}} {{characteristic}} of {{most members of}} the Nannostomus genus is the body color <b>pattern</b> <b>change</b> which occurs in these fish between night and day. Newly lit specimens can look dramatically different from those that have been under lighting for a few minutes. Typically, the longitudinal stripes are replaced by patches that run dorsoventrally. The physiological basis of these changes is understood in that they are known to be controlled by the melatonin system acting upon different types of melatonin receptors in melanphores located in the fish's skin. See also Nannostomus trifasciatus for additional information. However, N. anduzei does not show this characteristic; instead, at night, it is reported simply to become much paler in color, with very little evidence of horizontal stripes, and the red on the fins fading almost to nothing.|$|E

Previously, the stripes used to go around to underneath the jersey sleeves.

Although the white jerseys of the Minnesota Vikings at the time also had a similar striping pattern and continued as such (as well as the throwbacks the New England Patriots wore in the Thanksgiving game against the Detroit Lions in 2002, though the Patriots later wore the same throwbacks in 2009 with truncated stripes and in 2010 became their official alternate uniform), the Colts and most college teams with this striping pattern did not make this adjustment.|$|E

50|$|The {{climate of}} {{seasonal}} forests is typically {{controlled by a}} system called the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) located near the equator and created by the convergence of the trade winds from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The position of these bands vary seasonally, moving north in the northern summer and south in the northern winter, and ultimately controlling the wet and dry seasons in the tropics.These regions appear to have experienced strong warming, at a mean rate of 0.26 degrees Celsius per decade, which coincides with a global rise in temperature resulting from the anthropocentric inputs of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Studies have also found that precipitation has declined and tropical Asia has experienced an increase in dry season intensity whereas Amazonian has no significant <b>pattern</b> <b>change</b> in precipitation or dry season. Additionally, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events drive the inter-annual climatic variability in temperature and precipitation and result in drought and increased intensity of the dry season. As anthropogenic warming increases the intensity and frequency of ENSO will increase, rendering tropical rainforest regions susceptible to stress and increased mortality of trees and other plants.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to discussion of the reasonableness of sometimes seemingly innocent assumptions used in theoretical trade models that the direction of trade is both predetermined for each good for each country and fixed. Here, we provide computational evidence as to the reasonableness of this assumption. We consider a simple three-country, three-good, pure-exchange model with CES preferences. We compute free trade competitive equilibria, three-country non-cooperative Nash equilibria, and customs union equilibria for randomized parameterizations, and find that trade <b>patterns</b> <b>change</b> in around 35 % of the cases between free trade and customs union equilibria. In three-country Nash and customs unions comparisons trade <b>patterns</b> <b>change</b> roughly 40 % of the time. We evaluate alternative cases, including with different numbers of randomizations in the parameter space. Results remain robust, reinforcing our conclusion that the assumption of unchanged trade <b>pattern</b> <b>changes,</b> common in theoretical analysis, does not have firm numerical support in the cases we consider. ...|$|R

In {{this paper}} {{conceptual}} design study of modified CANDLE burn-up scheme based 400 MWt small long life Pb-Bi Cooled Fast Reactors with natural Uranium as Fuel Cycle Input has been performed. In this study the reactor cores are subdivided into 10 parts with equal volume in the axial directions. The natural uranium is initially put in region 1, after one cycle of 10 years of burn-up it is shifted to region 2 {{and the region}} 1 is filled by fresh natural uranium fuel. This concept is basically applied to all regions, i. e. shifted the core of I’th region into I+ 1 region {{after the end of}} 10 years burn-up cycle. For small reactor core, it is important to apply high breeding material, so that high volume fraction of 60 % fuel volume fraction nitride fuel is applied. The effective multiplication factor initially at 1. 005 but then continuously increases during 10 years of burn-up. The peak power density initially about 307 W/cc but then continuously decreases to 268 at the end of 10 years burn-up cycle.

The difference of the distribution orientation leads to the separation of the spatial pattern of banking industry, and the change of the distribution orientation leads to the change of spatial pattern. The degree of spatial <b>pattern</b> <b>change</b> is subject to the degree of change of distribution orientation, and the scale of bank resources in the regions, which supports the distribution orientation variation. Based on these theoretical frameworks, some indicators were designed to analyze the <b>pattern</b> <b>change</b> of China's banking industry and its effects since 1995 under the change of the distribution orientation. This paper finds that the orientation of economic benefit maximization driven by market causes the banking industry to concentrate in economically developed regions.
