5|$|The embryos {{probably}} represented near-hatchlings. While {{the skeletal}} features {{were similar to}} those of the adults, the body proportions were very dissimilar. The head was big with a short snout and very large orbits, whose diameter amounts 39% of the entire skull length. The neck was short, contrasting to the very long neck in the adults. Girdle bones and caudals were relatively tiny. The forelimbs were of equal length to the hindlimbs, indicating that newly hatched Massospondylus were quadrupedal, unlike the bipedal adults. The discovery of hatching footprints with manus impressions confirmed their quadrupedality. These impressions show that the hand was not pronated, with palm faces facing each other and the thumb facing forwards. The unpronated manus and the big head indicate that an effective locomotion was not possible for newly hatched Massospondylus. Notably, the near-hatchings had no teeth, suggesting they had no way of feeding themselves. Based on the lack of teeth and the ineffective locomotion, scientists speculate that <b>postnatal</b> <b>care</b> might have been necessary. This is further supported by evidence that the hatchings remained at the nest sites until they had doubled in size.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{necessary}} elements in an obstetric system of home confinements is well-organized <b>postnatal</b> home <b>care.</b> In The Netherlands home care assistants assist midwives during home delivery, they care for the new mother {{as well as the}} newborn baby, instruct the family on infant health care and carry out household duties. The growing demand for <b>postnatal</b> home <b>care</b> is difficult to meet; this has resulted in a short supply of the most popular day care programme and a level of provision which does not result in adequate services. This study acknowledges the patient perspective of maternity home care in order to contribute to its organization. The majority (79 %) of service centres were willing to participate. A total of 1812 (81 %) women who recently gave birth to a child responded to a postal questionnaire addressing the quality of care according to five dimensions: availability, continuity, interpersonal relationships, outcome and assistant's expertise. Almost one-third of the new mothers rated the availability as inadequate while the assistant's expertise was rated positively. <b>Postnatal</b> maternity home <b>care</b> is personalized, small-scale, and recognizes childbirth as a life event.

25|$|Early {{regulation}} {{and training of}} midwives had begun in the early 1900s. In 1911, New York City opened the first municipally sponsored American midwifery school called the Bellevue Hospital School for Midwives. Sara Josephine Baker played {{a prominent role in}} establishing the school. The school mostly enrolled Italian, German, Polish, and Hungarian immigrants and provided them with eight months of training in prenatal care, <b>postnatal</b> <b>care,</b> and deliveries. Additionally, the deliveries attended by midwives trained by Bellevue had lower maternal and infant mortality rates than citywide statistics.|$|E

25|$|In most poorer countries, health care—ranging {{from basic}} {{pharmaceuticals}} and <b>postnatal</b> <b>care</b> to costly multidrug therapies—remains very limited. Market forces drive private pharmaceutical companies, and many developed country government research programs, {{to focus on}} drugs needed in their environment, not necessarily those of the poorer countries. This is generating a growing controversy between rich and poorer nations over such issues as intellectual property rights, as some developing countries make their own copies, not always with permission, of drugs under patent protection. Developing countries also are less willing to make microbial samples available to companies that will make commercial vaccines from them, which may be too costly for the country that provided the sample.|$|E

The aim {{of this study is to}} compare Pakistan’s under-five mortality, neonatal mortality, and <b>postnatal</b> newborn <b>care</b> rates with those of other countries. Neonatal mortality rates and <b>postnatal</b> newborn <b>care</b> rates from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) of nine low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) from Asia and Africa were analyzed. Pakistan’s maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) policies and programs, which have been implemented in the country since 1990, were also analyzed. The results highlighted that <b>postnatal</b> newborn <b>care</b> in Pakistan was higher compared with the rest of countries, yet its neonatal mortality remained the worst. In Zimbabwe, both mortality rates have been increasing, whereas the neonatal mortality rates in Nepal and Afghanistan remained unchanged. An analysis of Pakistan’s MNCH programs showed that there is no nationwide policy on neonatal health. There were only a few programs concerning the health of newborns, and those were limited in scale. Pakistan’s example shows that increased coverage of neonatal care without ensuring quality is unlikely to improve neonatal survival rates. It is suggested that Pakistan needs a comprehensive policy on neonatal health similar to other countries, and its effective programs need to be scaled up, in order to obtain better neonatal health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in genomic technologies now enable a reunion of molecular and evolutionary biology. Researchers investigating naturally living animal populations are thus increasingly able to capitalize upon genomic technologies to connect molecular findings with multiple levels of biological organization. Using this vertical {{approach in the}} laboratory, epigenetic gene regulation has emerged as an important mechanism integrating genotype and phenotype. To connect phenotype to population fitness, however, this same vertical approach must now be applied to naturally living populations. A major obstacle to studying epigenetics in noninvasive samples is tissue specificity of epigenetic marks. Here, using the mouse as a proof‐of‐principle model, we present the first known attempt to validate an epigenetic assay for use in noninvasive samples. Specifically, we compare DNA methylation of the NGFI‐A (nerve growth factor‐inducible protein A) binding site in the promoter of the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr 3 c 1) gene between central (hippocampal) and peripheral noninvasive (fecal) tissues in juvenile Balb/c mice that had received varying levels of <b>postnatal</b> maternal <b>care.</b> Our results indicate that while hippocampal DNA methylation profiles correspond to maternal behavior, fecal DNA methylation levels do not. Moreover, concordance in methylation levels between these tissues within individuals only emerges after accounting {{for the effects of}} <b>postnatal</b> maternal <b>care.</b> Thus, although these findings may be specific to the Nr 3 c 1 gene, we urge caution when interpreting DNA methylation patterns from noninvasive tissues, and offer suggestions for further research in this field.

2500|$|Four {{elements}} {{are essential to}} maternal death prevention, according to UNFPA. First, prenatal care. It is recommended that expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits to check and monitor the health of mother and fetus. Second, skilled birth attendance with emergency backup such as doctors, nurses and midwives who have the skills to manage normal deliveries and recognize the onset of complications. Third, emergency obstetric care to address the major causes of maternal death which are hemorrhage, sepsis, unsafe abortion, hypertensive disorders and obstructed labour. Lastly, <b>postnatal</b> <b>care</b> which is the six weeks following delivery. During this time bleeding, sepsis and hypertensive disorders can occur and newborns are extremely vulnerable {{in the immediate aftermath}} of birth. Therefore, follow-up visits by a health worker to assess the health of both mother and child in the postnatal period is strongly recommended.|$|E
2500|$|PCE is very {{difficult}} to study because of a variety of factors that may confound the results: pre- and <b>postnatal</b> <b>care</b> may be poor; the pregnant mother and child may be malnourished; the amount of cocaine a mother takes can vary; she may take a variety of drugs during pregnancy in addition to cocaine; measurements for detecting deficits may not be sensitive enough; and results that are found may only last a short time. Studies differ in how they define heavy or light cocaine use during pregnancy, and the time period of exposure during pregnancy on which they focus (e.g. first, second, or third trimester. Drug use by mothers puts children at high risk for exposure to toxic or otherwise dangerous environments, and PCE does not present much risk beyond these risk factors. PCE is clustered with other risk factors to the child, such as physical abuse and neglect, domestic violence, and prenatal exposure to other substances. Such environmental factors are known to adversely affect children in the same areas being studied with respect to PCE.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: It {{is known}} that mother/child deaths can be {{prevented}} by having safe births and taking routine <b>postnatal</b> home <b>care.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate safety of births and <b>postnatal</b> home <b>care</b> visits of mothers having 0 - 11 month babies in the Center of Aydin. Methods: A cross-sectional design was used to study a group of 806 mothers. Multistage sampling method was used. Health stations was taken as cluster units. One rural-one urban health station from ten health-centers was selected by random sampling method. Safety of births, type of births, complications after births, home visits by health personel at postpartum period were asked. Results: Unsafe births was 6, 0 % in Aydin. It was found that family income, mother?s age/occupation/educational level, social security, number of children, father?s occupation/educational level and household size, effects the safety of births. 59, 9 % of women were visited by widwives at the postpartum period and mean number of visits were 2, 0 &# 177; 1, 7. At this period 9, 4 % of women had complications, and these complications were two times greater at unsafe births. Conclusion: Although Aydin is in the west part of Turkey, unsafe births and inadequate postpartum home visits are seen. In order to prevent these problems, health centers must take more active role.
