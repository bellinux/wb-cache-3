5|$|Concerns {{continued}} to be raised over fresh <b>plots</b> to liberate Edward, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got {{at least as far}} as breaking into the prison within the castle. As a result of these threats, Edward was moved around to other locations in secret for a period, before returning to permanent custody at the castle in the late summer of 1327. The political situation remained unstable, and new <b>plots</b> appear to have been formed to free him.|$|E

5|$|In meteorology, station {{models are}} {{symbolic}} illustrations showing the weather occurring {{at a given}} reporting station. Meteorologists created the station model to fit a number of weather elements into a small space on weather maps. This allows map users to analyze patterns in atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed & direction, cloud cover, precipitation, and other parameters. The most common station <b>plots</b> depict surface weather observations although upper air <b>plots</b> at various mandatory levels are also frequently depicted.|$|E
5|$|Judgment Day {{provided}} {{the culmination of}} various scripted <b>plots</b> and storylines. A month before the event, several professional wrestling matches and scripted <b>plots</b> were played out on WWE programming (Raw, Friday Night SmackDown!, and ECW on Sci Fi) to create feuds between various wrestlers, casting them as villains and heroes. Raw, SmackDown, and ECW were also the names of WWE's televised brands– a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a specific program, thus each brand promoted distinct matches.|$|E
5|$|The Country Wife is more neatly {{constructed}} {{than most}} Restoration comedies, but {{is typical of}} its time and place in having three sources and three <b>plots.</b> The separate <b>plots</b> are interlinked but distinct, each projecting a sharply different mood.

50|$|A carpet <b>plot</b> is {{any of a}} few {{different}} {{specific types}} of <b>plot.</b> The more common <b>plot</b> {{referred to as a}} carpet <b>plot</b> is one that illustrates the interaction between two or more independent variables and one or more dependent variables in a two-dimensional <b>plot.</b> Besides the ability to incorporate more variables, another feature that distinguishes a carpet <b>plot</b> from an equivalent contour <b>plot</b> or 3D surface <b>plot</b> is that a carpet <b>plot</b> can be used to more accurately interpolate data points. A conventional carpet <b>plot</b> can capture the interaction of up to three independent variables and three dependent variables and still be easily read and interpolated.|$|R

It is used to assess autocorrelation and cyclic structure. The spectral power function is a smoothed Fourier transform of the autocovariance function. An equi-spaced time series is one in which the distance between adjacent points is constant. The spectral estimate (also called power) at a given frequency for a single discrete time series x t is...|$|R

5|$|The <b>plots</b> shown {{of image}} impedance, {{attenuation}} and phase change are the <b>plots</b> of a low-pass prototype filter section. The prototype has a cut-off frequency of ωc = 1 rad/s and a nominal impedance R0 = 1 Ω. This {{is produced by}} a filter half-section where L = 1 henry and C = 1 farad. This prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values. The low-pass prototype can also be transformed into high-pass, band-pass or band-stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations.|$|E

5000|$|In {{electrical}} engineering and control theory, a Bode <b>plot</b> [...] is a graph {{of the frequency}} response of a system. It is usually {{a combination of a}} Bode magnitude <b>plot,</b> expressing the magnitude (usually in decibels) of the frequency response, and a Bode phase <b>plot,</b> expressing the phase shift. Both quantities are <b>plotted</b> against a horizontal axis proportional to the logarithm of frequency. Given that the decibel is itself a logarithmic scale, the Bode amplitude <b>plot</b> is log-log <b>plot,</b> whereas the Bode phase <b>plot</b> is a lin-log <b>plot.</b>|$|R

40|$|Parallel <b>plot</b> is a {{relatively}} new type of <b>plot</b> in comparison to scatter <b>plot.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} find out the effectiveness of parallel <b>plot</b> visualization in comparison to the scatter <b>plot</b> for novice users. Comparison through literature shows that parallel and scatter <b>plot</b> visualization techniques offer similar visualization features. A study was conducted based on the parallel <b>plot</b> in Parallel Coordinate for the Qur’an (PaCQ) interface using a relational model, Goals Operators Methods and Selection Rules (GOMS) analysis and user performance evaluation. Based on the GOMS analysis, the subtasks and operation time involved in exploring data in scatter <b>plot</b> exceeds the subtasks and operation time in parallel <b>plot</b> in relation to the PaCQ interface developed for novice user even though, earlier studies found that scatter <b>plot</b> is easier to use. The GOMS analysis shows that the average time taken to complete tasks for the parallel <b>plot</b> is shorter then the scatter <b>plot.</b> A user performance evaluation shows no significant difference in the scores of interpreting the parallel <b>plot</b> within three levels of educational level of novice users. These findings provide evidences that the parallel <b>plot</b> is more effective for PaCQ designed for novice users...|$|R
