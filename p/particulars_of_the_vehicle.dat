40|$|This {{dissertation}} reports {{an evaluation}} study which {{was done with}} an educational programme for Automotive Service Technicians which was adapted for South African conditions and derived from a programme used internationally, and originally developed in Schweinfurt, Germany in 2005. The programme was designed to answer to particular problems experienced during automotive driveline-component installations. Since the inception of this programme, ZF Germany had been training representatives from their different subsidiaries over {{the world on the}} essential elements of automotive driveline installation protocol. The representatives were trained to adapt the core programme in accordance with the <b>particulars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> populations in each respective country, and the researcher has performed this task The aim of this research was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} one particular module known as “Guidelines to clutch replacement” with regard to bringing about the desired changes in knowledge, attitude and behaviour within the trainees. Previous anecdotal feedback from the industry had suggested that the programme had been helpful in the reduction of installation errors, but the extent of the successes and failures of the programme had been unknown until this study. The training department at ZF South Africa was tasked to design further training modules based on the findings of the module under study in order to establish the successes and failures of the core concept for improvement of successive programmes. The approach for this programme evaluation was utilization-focused which allowed the researcher to choose from and combine a variety of data collection strategies over the complete range of summative and formative evaluation approaches. However, in keeping with the stated aim of this study, this study had been limited to a summative inquiry by employing a quantitative data collection strategy at the hand of a quasi-experimental research design. This research report presents the findings of a one-day intervention programme that was offered to Automotive Service Technicians in the Gauteng area. The conceptual framework that was adopted for the research was based on the four level evaluation framework of Kirkpatrick (1998) with the first three levels having been empirically tested and the fourth level discussed on the basis of empirical information. Findings suggest that although the levels of knowledge-acquisition could not to be considered as high, behaviour modification had indeed been observed to be in alignment with the clutch-installation-protocol and almost all the respondents had adopted the protocol as their preferred way of executing clutch installations. In addition, most respondents found the programme to be pleasant and of a high utility value. Certain problems with the programme became evident, such as the pace having been too fast; printed hand-outs were not considered to have high utility value, and sensitivity to personal and cultural differences were found to be lacking. The low levels recorded for knowledge acquisition may be language related which possibly relates to the fast pace of the course. The research findings suggest that the course should be spread over two days instead of one day and be augmented with practical demonstrations and re-designed printed hand-outs. In order to effectively measure level four of the Kirkpatrick framework, criteria of concern should be negotiated with participating organisations in order to provide relative data for answering research questions on this level. Procedures for collecting data over the course of several years need to be established and agreed upon by all stakeholders for such data to be reliable and valid in the inclusion of a time-series study. Regarding a relatively simple programme such as the programme under study with programme objectives that have a predominant procedural-knowledge focus, the Kirkpatrick framework has been found to be effective and its procedures may be applied in other industry-based training programmes. An added academic contribution to the previous one is that the Kirkpatrick framework as utilised in this study has shown that the framework offers a high utility value for fast-paced short courses where contact time with trainees are limited and evaluation designs need to fit in with the practical limitations. The high utility value of the Kirkpatrick framework became evident in the findings of this study where transfer of learning had evidently taken place regardless of possible learning problems such as language barriers.

The {{expansion is}}coupled with a related increase in <b>the</b> demands <b>of</b> power and design. Now, this is goodarena of engineering opportunities and challenges. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> challenges faced, isdeveloping fault tolerant systems, which increases the overall automotive and passengersafety. The development in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> automotive electronics {{has led to the}} innovationof some very sophisticated technology. However, with increasing sophistication intechnology also rises the requirement to develop fault tolerant solutions. As one of many steps towards developing a fault tolerant system, this thesis presents anexhaustive fault analysis. The modeling and fault analysis is carried out for a vehicle withfour in-wheel motors. The primary goal is to collect as many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible failuremodes that could occur in a vehicle. A database of possible failure modes is retrievedfrom <b>the</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Dynamics research group at KTH. Now with further inputs to thisdatabase the individual faults are factored with respect to change in parameters <b>of</b> vehicleperformance. <b>The</b> factored faults are grouped with respect to similar outputcharacterization. The fault groups are modeled and integrated into a vehicle model developed earlier inMatlab/Simulink. All the fault groups are simulated under specific conditions and theresults are obtained. <b>The</b> dynamic behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> under such fault conditions isanalyzed. Further, in <b>particular</b> <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> with electronic stabilitycontrol (ESC) under the fault conditions is tested.

Also included is a compensator coupled across the integrator, in a feed-forward loop, for receiving <b>the</b> angular rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> and outputting compensated angular rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> A summer combines the non-compensated attitudes and the compensated angular rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> to <b>vehicle</b> to form estimated vehicle attitudes for controlling the instrument with respect to the line-of-sight reference. The compensator is configured to provide error compensation to the instrument free-of any feedback loop that uses an error signal. The compensator may include a transfer function providing a fixed gain to the received angular rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> <b>The</b> compensator may, alternatively, include a is transfer function providing a variable gain as a function of frequency to operate on the received angular rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Vehicle {{collision}} sensor system and reporting accident to police is an electronic device {{installed in a}} vehicle to inform police man in case of accident to track <b>the</b> <b>vehicle’s</b> location. This system works using pressure sensor, GPS and GSM technology. These technology embedded together to sense <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> collision and indicate <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> or locate <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> accident in order {{to solve the problem}} immediately (as soon as possible). For doing so AT 89 S 52 microcontroller is interfaced serially to a GSM modem, GPS receiver, and pressure sensor. A GSM modem is used to send the position (Latitude and Longitude) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> <b>the</b> plate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> and <b>the</b> SMS text from the accident place. The GPS modem will continuously give the data (longitude and latitude) and Load sensor senses <b>the</b> collision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> against obstacles and input to microcontroller. As load sensor senses the collision, the GSM start to send <b>the</b> plate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> text message and <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> in terms <b>of</b> latitude and longitude in real time...|$|R
