25|$|At {{the launch}} of the Ninety Land Rover had insisted that there would not be a 2.5-litre {{development}} of the <b>petrol</b> <b>engine.</b> However, buyer demand and economics made the change inevitable. The larger <b>petrol</b> <b>engine</b> was launched in 1985 (having been developed under the codename 'Project Harrier') and, like its 2.25-litre predecessor it had much in common with the diesel engine. The block was identical, as were most ancillary parts. The key difference was that the <b>petrol</b> <b>engine</b> retained its timing chain, since it lacked the need to drive an injector pump. The cylinder head was adapted to use unleaded fuel. As before, the engine was smooth and refined, and provided the Land Rover with adequate road performance. However, as fuel prices rose and diesel engines improved sales of the petrol engines fell, especially in Europe. It remained a popular option in Africa and other areas where fuel prices or the simplicity of the engine made it an attractive option. It remained available until 1994; although by this time sales had dwindled to almost nothing {{in the face of a}} new generation of refined diesel engines. By this time buyers were limited to those with specific reasons to buy petrol-engined vehicles- for example several police forces in the UK bought fleets of 2.5 petrol Defenders in the mid-1990s because a diesel-engined vehicles would have caused maintenance and logistical problems when operated alongside the fleet of standard patrol cars, all of which were petrol fuelled.|$|E
