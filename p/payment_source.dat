5000|$|The {{foundations}} of the APT tax proposal - a small, uniform tax on all economic transactions - involve simplification, base broadening, reductions in marginal tax rates, the elimination of tax and information returns and the automatic collection of tax revenues at the <b>payment</b> <b>source.</b> The APT approach would extend the tax base from income, consumption and wealth to all transactions. Proponents regard it as a revenue neutral transactions tax, whose tax base is primarily made up of financial transactions. The APT tax extends the tax reform ideas of John Maynard Keynes, James Tobin [...] and Lawrence Summers, [...] to their logical conclusion, namely to tax the broadest possible tax base at the lowest possible tax rate. The goal to significantly improve economic efficiency, enhance stability in financial markets, and reduce to a minimum the costs of tax administration (assessment, collection,and compliance costs). There is disagreement over whether the tax is progressive, with the debate primarily centered on whether the volume of taxed transactions rise disproportionately with a person's income and net worth. Simulations of the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances [...] demonstrate that high income and wealthy individuals undertake a disproportionate volume of transactions since they own {{a disproportionate share of}} financial assets that have relatively high turnover rates. However, since the APT tax has not yet been adopted, some argue that one can not predict whether the tax will be progressive or not.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE. This study {{examines}} conversion to Medicaid as a <b>payment</b> <b>source</b> among {{a cohort of}} newly admitted nursing home residents. DATA SOURCE. The longitudinal data used came from regular assessments of residents in the National Health Corporation's 43 for-profit nursing homes in Missouri, Kentucky, South Carolina, and Tennessee. This information system tracked all residents who were discharged, providing a comprehensive record that may have spanned multiple admissions. STUDY DESIGN. Using survival analysis methods, Cox regression, and survival trees, we contrasted the effect of state, initial <b>payment</b> <b>source,</b> education, age, and functional status on the rate of spend-down to Medicaid. DATA EXTRACTION METHODS. New-admission cohorts were created by linking an admission record for a newly admitted resident with all subsequent assessments and follow-up records to ascertain the precise dates of any <b>payment</b> <b>source</b> changes and other discharge transitions. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. For the 1, 849 individuals who were admitted as self-payers and who {{were still in the}} nursing {{home at the end of}} one year, there is a 19 percent probability of converting to Medicaid. All analytic methods revealed that education, age, and state of residence were predictive of spend-down among residents who were admitted as self-payers. CONCLUSIONS. Our results confirm the effect of education as an SES indicator and state as a proxy for Medicaid policy on spend-down.

MethodsA total of 99, 508 HF admissions from 244 sites between January 2005 and September 2009 were analyzed. Patients were grouped on the basis of payer status (private/health maintenance organization, no insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid) with private/health maintenance organization as the reference group. ResultsThe no-insurance group was less likely to receive evidence-based beta-blockers (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0. 73; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 62 to 0. 86), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (OR: 0. 59; 95 % CI: 0. 50 to 0. 70), or anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (OR: 0. 73; 95 % CI: 0. 61 to 0. 87). Similarly, the Medicaid group was less likely to receive evidence-based beta-blockers (OR: 0. 86; 95 % CI: 0. 78 to 0. 95) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (OR: 0. 86; 95 % CI: 0. 78 to 0. 96). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers were prescribed less frequently in the Medicare group (OR: 0. 89; 95 % CI: 0. 81 to 0. 98).

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Lower {{physical}} and social functioning in pregnancy {{has been linked to}} an increased risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight infants, butt few studies have examined racial differences in pregnant women&# 8217;s perception of their functioning. Even fewer studies have elucidated the demographic and clinical factors contributing to racial differences in functioning. Our objective was to determine whether there are racial differences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in early pregnancy; and if so, to identify the contributions of socio-demographic characteristics, depression symptoms, social support and clinical factors to these differences. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Cross-sectional study of 175 women in early pregnancy attending prenatal clinics in urban setting. In multivariate analysis, we assessed the independent relation of black race (compared to white) to HRQoL scores from the eight domains of the Medical Outcomes (SF- 36) Survey: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, Vitality, General Health, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health. We compared socio-demographic and clinical factors and depression symptoms between black and white women and assessed the relative importance of these factors in explaining racial differences in {{physical and}} social functioning. 				 				 					 						Results 					Black women comprised 59 % of the sample; white women comprised 41 %. Before adjustment, black women had scores that were 14 points lower in Physical Function and Bodily Pain, 8 points lower in General Health, 4 points lower in Vitality and 7 points lower in Social Functioning. After adjustment for depression symptoms, social support and clinical factors, black women still had HRQoL scores that were 4 to 10 points lower than white women, but the differences were no longer statistically significant.
