40|$|Abstract. The {{economic}} development process in Malta (as {{in all other}} countries) has been characterised by a gradual decline in the agricultural sector. The switch from subsistence farming to commercial farming in order to compensate for this decline was hastened in the post-war period, the period under analysis, due to pressures of a shrinking labour force and the contraction of agricultural land. Malta's agricultural production has been largely dominated by animal husbandry. The decline in the goat population since the early fifties was attributable to increases in forage costs and government legislation to promote cow's milk. <b>Poultry</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbit</b> meat were largely marketed between non-commercial breeders and consumers.

50|$|Overcoming poor {{management}} was more difficult. Local party, state, and cooperative organizations were admonished to manage animal husbandry more efficiently, and cooperative members were requested {{to care for}} collectively owned livestock {{as if it were}} their own. In addition, more concrete measures to improve the management and the productivity of animal husbandry were adopted in the late 1980s. The individual livestock holdings of workers, employees, and citizens were increased to eight head per household in major towns, sixteen head in smaller towns, and twenty-five head in rural areas; households were allowed to dispose of surplus produce through the cooperative trade network and through the state procurement system. Auxiliary farms run by factories, offices, and schools were established to raise additional pigs, <b>poultry,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits,</b> as well as to grow some vegetables. Family contracts concluded on a voluntary basis with cooperatives or with state farms were reported by the government to increase high-quality output, to lower production expenses, and to enhance production efficiency.|$|E

An advice center was set up for pregnant women of which only 26 opted for an abortion, which was legal in special cases, after consultation. Another 460 women brought on their pregnancies without problems, their children not showing any sign of malformation or pathologies. Herwig von Zwehl (Technical Director of ICMESA) and Paolo Paoletti (director of production at ICMESA) were arrested.

40|$|Pleuromutilins (tiamulin and valnemulin) are {{antimicrobial}} agents {{that are used}} mainly in veterinary medicine, especially for swine {{and to a lesser}} extent for <b>poultry</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits.</b> In pigs, tiamulin and valnemulin are used to treat swine dysentery, spirochaete-associated diarrhoea, porcine proliferative enteropathy, enzootic pneumonia and other infections where Mycoplasma is involved. There are concerns about the reported increases in the MICs of tiamulin and valnemulin for porcine Brachyspira hyodysenteriae isolates from different European countries, as only a limited number of antimicrobials are available for the treatment of swine dysentery where resistance to these antimicrobials is already common and widespread. The loss of pleuromutilins as effective tools to treat swine dysentery because of further increases in resistance or as a consequence of restrictions would present a considerable threat to pig health, welfare and productivity. In humans, only one product containing pleuromutilins (retapamulin) is authorized currently for topical use; however, products for oral and intravenous administration to humans with serious multidrug-resistant skin infections and respiratory infections, including those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are being developed.

40|$|Replacing {{red meat}} and {{processed}} red meat for white meat, fish, legumes or eggs {{is associated with}} lower risk of incidence of metabolic syndrome. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Few studies have assessed the association between consumption of red meat (RM) and processed red meats (PRM) and the incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and results have been inconsistent. We investigated associations between total consumption of meat and its subtypes and incident MetS and estimated the effect of substituting RM or PRM for alternative protein-rich foods. METHODS: We analyzed 1868 participants (55 - 80 years-old) recruited into the PREDIMED study who had no MetS at baseline and were followed for a median of 3. 2 years. MetS was defined using updated harmonized criteria. Anthropometric variables, dietary habits, and blood biochemistry were determined at baseline and yearly thereafter. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of MetS were estimated for the two upper tertiles (versus the lowest one) of mean consumption of meat and its subtypes during the follow-up as exposure. RESULTS: Comparing the highest vs the lowest tertile of consumption, we observed {{an increased risk of}} MetS incidence, with HRs of 1. 23 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 03 - 1. 45) and 1. 46 (CI: 1. 22 - 1. 74) for total meat and pooled RM and PRM, respectively. Compared with participants in the lowest tertile, those in the highest tertile of <b>poultry</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbit</b> consumption had a lower risk of MetS incidence. The risk of MetS was lower when one-serving/day of RM or PRM was replaced by legumes, <b>poultry</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbit,</b> fish or eggs. CONCLUSION: RM and PRM consumption was associated with higher risk of MetS. Replacing RM or PRM with other protein-rich foods related to a lower risk of MetS and should, therefore, be encouraged.

40|$|Ammonia {{concentrations}} and airflow {{rates are}} the main parameters needed to determine ammonia emissions from animal houses. It is possible to classify their measurement methods into two main groups according to the sampling frequency: semi-continuous and daily average measurements. In the first method, ammonia concentrations and airflow rates are monitored during a certain period and instant emission rates are calculated. When using daily average methods, 24 -h average ammonia concentrations and airflow rates are {{used to determine the}} average daily emission rate. As less information is used in the second method, an error may be expected. The aim of this work was to determine the nature and magnitude of this error. Three databases containing data from semi-continuous ammonia emissions measurements from different animal houses (pigs, <b>poultry</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits)</b> in three European countries (Denmark, The Netherlands and Spain) were used to characterise this error. An average systematic deviation between methods of 1. 5 % was found. The magnitude of this bias was directly related to the daily variation of ammonia concentration and airflow rate. The magnitude of this bias, and also the random component of the error, were modelled. The developed model adequately described variation in bias in the studied dataset (R 2 = 0. 85) and {{can be used as a}} tool to decide which type of measurement methods can be used...|$|E
40|$|Contamination of {{food and}} feed with mycotoxins is a {{worldwide}} problem. At present, acute mycotoxicosis caused by high doses is rare in humans and animals. Ingestion of low to moderate amounts of Fusarium mycotoxins is common and generally does not result in obvious intoxication. However, these low amounts may impair intestinal health, immune function and/or pathogen fitness, resulting in altered host pathogen interactions and thus a different outcome of infection. This review summarizes {{the current state of}} knowledge about the impact of Fusarium mycotoxin exposure on human and animal host susceptibility to infectious diseases. On the one hand, exposure to deoxynivalenol and other Fusarium mycotoxins generally exacerbates infections with parasites, bacteria and viruses across a wide range of animal host species. Well-known examples include coccidiosis in poultry, salmonellosis in pigs and mice, colibacillosis in pigs, necrotic enteritis in poultry, enteric septicemia of catfish, swine respiratory disease, aspergillosis in <b>poultry</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits,</b> reovirus infection in mice and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus infection in pigs. However, on the other hand, T- 2 toxin has been shown to markedly decrease the colonization capacity of Salmonella in the pig intestine. Although the impact of the exposure of humans to Fusarium toxins on infectious diseases is less well known, extrapolation from animal models suggests possible exacerbation of, for instance, colibacillosis and salmonellosis in humans, as well...|$|E
40|$|Coccidiosis, an {{intestinal}} plasmodium infection, {{is a major}} {{infectious disease}} in <b>poultry</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits.</b> Eleven different coccidiostats are licensed in the EU {{for the prevention of}} coccidiosis in these animal species. According to their chemical nature and main biological activity, these compounds can be grouped as ionophoric (monensin, lasalocid sodium, salinomycin, narasin, maduramicin and semduramicin) or non-ionophoric (robenidine, decoquinate, nicarbazin, diclazuril, and halofuginone) substances. Coccidiostats are used as feed additives, mixed upon request into the compounded feed. During the technical process of commercial feed production, cross-contamination of feed batches can result in the exposure of non-target animals and induce adverse health effects in these animals due to a specific sensitivity of mammalian species as compared to poultry. Residue formation in edible tissues of non-target species may result in unexpected human exposure through the consumption of animal products. This review presents recent risk assessments performed by the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The health risk to non-target species that would result from the consumption of cross-contaminated feed with coccidostats at levels of 2, 5 or 10 % was found to be negligible for most animal species with the exception of salinomycin and monensin in horses because of the particular sensitivity for which toxicity may occur when cross-contamination exceeds 2 % and 5 % respectively. Kinetic data and tissue analyses showed that residues of coccidiostats may occur in the liver and eggs in some cases. However, the level of residues of each coccidiostat in edible animal tissues remained sufficiently low that the aggregate exposure of consumers would not exceed the established acceptable daily intake (ADI) of each coccidiostat. It could be concluded that technical cross-contamination of animal feeds would not be expected to adversely affect the health of consumers...|$|E

30|$|These anti-pigeon {{measures}} {{occurred during}} {{the emergence of a}} wide-reaching, hygienist conception of the modern city in the twentieth century in Europe and the United States (Hodak 1999; Leblanc 2003), that is, ‘orderly and sanitized, with nature subdued and compartmentalized’ (Jerolmack 2008 : 72). This hygienism was explained as a reaction to the massive arrival of animals and to ever-growing cities with proportionately increased city dweller requirements in terms of consumption of animal products {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. Entire herds of animals were brought to the city daily, crammed together in the streets, to be slaughtered and quartered, often in open sheds. The exhibition of bloody carcasses on the butchers’ façades; the boom of tanneries; the multiplication of horses, dogs, and cats, and thus, the omnipresence of manure, excrement, and urine; the development of maggots; smells of industrial processing of animal products; and the violent sight of animal mistreatment resulted in the creation and intensification of an olfactory and sonic world (Baratay 2009). The unceasing coming and going of animals provoked chaotic traffic, especially on market days, and exhausted animals and hastily trained drivers caused increasingly more incidents. <b>Poultry</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits</b> were raised in humble families’ households, whereas cows and goats, which were kept in the numerous urban barns, wandered around daily to provide people with fresh milk (Baratay, 2009). Complaints, increased conflicts between animal users and others in their neighborhood, as well as growing attention to sanitary and hygienist concerns forced municipalities to intervene (Baratay, 1998). Programs of urban renovation were launched at the end of the nineteenth century, which cleaned up the city and pushed slaughterhouses to the fringes. This redevelopment of the urban landscape not only included larger streets and squares but also vegetation, instead of animals, as a structuring element of urban space, as well in an aesthetic aim to clean up the air (Leblanc 2003).|$|E
40|$|Probiotic requirements, {{such as the}} {{capability}} for tolerance to gastric acid and biles, the ability to inhibit pathogenic ba- cteria and {{to adhere to the}} intestinal epithelilum of host animals, were used for the evaluation of lactic acid bacteria as probiotic use. These lactic acid bacteria to be evaluated were isolated from some commercial dairy products, pickled mustard, and the digestive tracts of porcine, <b>poultry</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits.</b> It was found that lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products were less tolerant to the acidity of pH 2. 0 buffer and gastic juice in comparison to those bacteria isolat- ed from animal intestines. For antibiotic resistance, there were no significant difference among strains from various sources. Resistance to multiple antibiotics were observed for most of the bacterial strains. For epithelium adsorption capability, it was found that lactic acid strains isolated from animal sources possess better adsorption capability although host specificity was not observed. On the pathogenic bacteria inhi- bition study, it was found that lactic acid from dairy product were able to inhibit most of the pathegonic bacteria tested. In conclusion, a strain called L. fermentun R 6, was able {{to be used as a}} feed supplements for continuous feeding use. Schematic representation for plasmid profile of lactic acid ba- cteria using bioimage analysis system shows that for lactic acid bacteria isolated from animals and pickled mustard there were several plasmids with sizes ranging from 1 kb to 50 kb, while for lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products, these was only one kind of plasmid with size of 24 - 25 kb. In the future, however, in combination with the results for genomic DNA polymorphism analysis, the probiotic characterisit- ics for lactic acid bacteria may able be correlated to the data of the DNA finger printing. 以做為生菌劑應具有的重要條件，如耐酸能力，耐膽鹽能力，對腸內病原 菌的拮抗性及吸附於宿主腸道上皮細胞之能力等，評估由乳製品，酸菜， 豬、雞、兔之胃腸道等不同來源的乳酸菌做為生菌劑的可行性。以耐酸性 試驗而言，由乳製品分離之菌株對pH 2. 0 之緩衝液或胃液的耐酸性，比較 由動物腸道分離者，明顯為差；而對膽鹽耐受性最佳之 4 株菌亦為由動物 來源分離者，表現最差的 3 株乳酸菌則分離自乳製品；對抗生素之抗性， 各種不同來源乳酸菌之間無明顯差異，由乳製品、酸菜、動物腸道等各種 來源分離之菌株中，都發現有能抗多種抗生素者；吸附性則以由動物腸道 分離者表現較佳，但由試驗結果，並未發現由動物腸道分離之乳酸菌有宿 主特異性；抑菌作用之試驗結果，由乳製品分離之乳酸菌，能抑制大多數 受測病源菌，而其它來源乳酸菌則否。綜合以上各試驗結果，由兔腸道內 容物分離之乳酸菌 L. fermentum R 6 其耐酸性，抑菌性，膽鹽耐受力和 對於抗生素的抗性等性質均佳，雖然對動物腸道上皮細胞不具吸附能力， 仍可將其發展為連續性投予的生菌劑。將乳酸菌之質體抽出，經膠體電泳 並照像後，以影像處理系統分析照片中之質體圖譜。觀察各乳酸菌之質體 圖譜，由動物和酸菜所分離出的乳酸菌質體較多，而由乳製品分離出之乳 酸菌則僅有一個質體。質體多者，其各項特性試驗結果彼此不同，而其特 性與只有一個質體的乳酸菌之特性也無特殊差異。由這些結果，目前仍無 法由圖譜看出乳酸菌質體與特性間的關連。這些圖譜，可再配合應用脈衝 式電泳所得染色體圖譜(Genomic DNA polymorphism) 的分析，則可依這些 圖譜，確認同一乳酸菌菌種的特定菌株，並了解其做為生菌劑之可行性...|$|E
40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of animal products (eggs, milk and meat) is the reflect {{of both the}} tissue fatty acid biosynthesis and the fatty acid composition of ingested lipids. This relationship is stronger in monogastrics (pigs, <b>poultry</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbits)</b> than in ruminants, where dietary fatty acids are hydrogenated in the rumen. There is an increasing recognition of {{the health benefits of}} polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), because these fatty acids are essential for humans. In addition, the ratio n- 6 /n- 3 fatty acids in the human diet is important. This ratio by far exceeds the recommended value of 5. Therefore, inclusion of fish meals, or n- 3 PUFA rich oils, or linseed in animal diets is a valid means of meeting consumer demand for animal products that are nutritionally beneficial. The studies that are undertaken on animals mainly use diets supplemented with linseed, as a source of n- 3 fatty acids. The use of linseed diets generally leads to an increased n- 3 fatty acid content in animal products (egg, meat, milk) in ruminants and monogastrics. Recent studies have also demonstrated that neither the processing nor the cooking affects the PUFA content of pork meat or meat products. The ability of unsaturated fatty acids, especially those with more than two double bonds, to rapidly oxidise, is important in regulating the shelf life of animal products (rancidity and colour deterioration); however, a good way to avoid such problems is to use antioxidant products (such as vitamin E) in the diet. Some studies also show that {{it is not necessary to}} feed animals with linseed-supplemented diets for a long time to have the highest increase in PUFA content of the products. So, short-term diet manipulation can be a practical reality for industry. As the market for n- 3 PUFA enriched products is today limited in most countries, other studies must be undertaken to develop this kind of production...|$|E

The present review summarises the knowledge on muscle fibre characteristics and ontogenesis in these species. Myofibre ontogenesis begins very early during embryonic life, with the appearance of two or three successive waves of myoblasts which constitute the origin of the different types of muscle fibres. In small animals (rodents <b>and</b> <b>poultry),</b> a primary <b>and</b> a secondary generation of fibres arise respectively during the embryonic and foetal stages of development.

This occurs during foetal life (bovines, ovines, pigs <b>and</b> <b>poultry)</b> or during the first postnatal month in <b>rabbits.</b> Contractile <b>and</b> metabolic differentiation proceed by steps in parallel to myogenesis and are partially linked to each other. In bovines and ovines, the main events occur during foetal life, whereas they occur soon after birth in the pig, <b>poultry</b> <b>and</b> <b>rabbit,</b> but some plasticity remains later in life in all species.
