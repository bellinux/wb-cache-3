40|$|Photo-interpretation is the {{technique}} of stereoscopic observation of air photograph in which natural and artificial focuses appear evident. The <b>photographic</b> <b>reading</b> acknowledges them and photographic analysis classifies and interrelates them, translating common features of different facts into the drawn up models or patterns. The photographic interpretation integrates elements belonging to reading and analyzing, elaborating them in function of interpretation criteria and {{by means of an}} inductive-deductive evaluation gets to the inference of facts not registered themselves in the photographic picture. This technique that came up to an elevate technical and methodical development during the second world war, is essential to this kind of studies. Afterwards, the authors state the advantages obtained on applying this technique in the zone of Villa Cerro de Montevideo, recommending its application in a big scale.

40|$|Vilém Flusser {{describes}} a printed {{image as a}} "significant surface," a plane to be scanned and navigated, and enabling disclosure of meaning. This paper concerns the process of re-mapping the image via a haptic relationship of folding, cutting and tearing. The reading of a significant surface with territorial, divisive spatial actions. Activating this haptic relationship we create interventions that provide a reconnection with the real {{as opposed to the}} space simulated within the image. A cut, fold or tear creates a material border, intimating what Barthes, in "Pleasure of the Text" calls a site representative of a surface's obedience and simultaneously the scar of an actions aesthetic agitation. These are spaces colonised by the hand. As Hito Steyerl points out "discipline is the index of conflict" an epistemological and/or aesthetic innovation through the cut, the fold or tear is a means to destabilise an image's imposed hierarchical authority. Like John Heartfield’s "dialectical problems of form," actions against the surface of an image are instigated to deliberately depose its order and to strategically breach the language of <b>photographic</b> <b>reading,</b> imposing a complex territorial dialogue between the real and representational...|$|E

40|$|Historical maps {{displayed}} in power-related settings {{have often been}} considered from a critical, representational perspective and have been researched {{with regard to their}} predictive, ideological content. With the recent emergence of a postrepresentational approach to cartography, a call for contextual creative research on maps ‘‘in the wild’’ has emerged. The consideration of pervasive digital cartography has increased attention toward aspects such as context-specific design, display formats, and areas. Common people encounter these digital ‘‘cartifacts,’’ as well as more traditional ones, within the everyday urban environment (mainly as part of city wallscapes). Photography could be used to profitably research ‘‘mapscapes’’ as they are perceived, lived, and felt. The <b>photographic</b> selective <b>reading</b> of cartographic signs on urban surfaces, beyond being a means of playfully engaging the material spatialities of maps, could also serve as a tool for generating map theorization. A photo essay based on cartographic encounters in Istanbul in 2010 is provided here as an example of creative exchange between map studies and visual methodologie...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{provides}} a critical appraisal of photo elicitation as a methodological tool for understanding what E. P. Thompson conceives as history from below. The discussion argues that <b>reading</b> <b>photographic</b> representations {{of other cultures}} is often structured within the flow and contestation of power. To study such representation, Manyozo contends, a scholar should construct a conversation among the circuits of culture within which such photographs were taken, were exchanged and are being made sense of. In conclusion, the chapter argues that reading ethnographic photography is a convergence of {{the experiences of the}} photographer, those photographed, the scholars reading the images and the sociocultural context in which the reading is made...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{what the}} {{processes}} of <b>reading</b> <b>photographic</b> images and literary texts share in common. A number of seminal theoretical texts published since the 1960 s are {{used to examine the}} problematic from three different angles: authority, social convention, and narrativity. These texts by theorists like Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, Mikhail Bakhtin, Wolfgang Iser or Stanley Fish are confronted with artistic works and with each other, and thereby help to renegotiate persistent problems in traditional epistemological distinctions between media like the sequential text and the still image. The primary sources are Julio Cortázar’s short story ‘Las babas del diablo’ (1959), Michelangelo Antonioni’s film 'Blowup' (1966), James Agee’s and Walker Evans’ 'Let Us Now Praise Famous Men' (1941), as well as artistic photographs by Duane Michals, Jeff Wall and Cindy Sherman...|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} of an electron from a metal nanostructure under illumination and its 					subsequent acceleration in a plasmonic field forms a platform to extend these 					phenomena to deposited nanoparticles, {{which can be}} studied by state-of-the-art 					confocal microscopy combined with femtosecond optical excitation. The emitted 					and accelerated electrons leave defect tracks in the immersion oil, which can be 					revealed by thermoluminescence. These <b>photographic</b> tracks are <b>read</b> out with the 					confocal microscope and have a maximum length of about 80 μm, which corresponds 					to a kinetic energy of about 100 keV. This energy {{is consistent with the}} energy 					provided by the intense laser pulse combined with plasmonic local field 					enhancement. The results are discussed {{within the context of the}} rescattering 					model by which electrons acquire more energy. The visualization of electron 					tracks originating from plasmonic field enhancement around a gold nanoparticle 					opens a new way to study with confocal microscopy both the plasmonic properties 					of metal nano objects as well as high energy electron interaction with 					matter...|$|R
40|$|African {{photography}} {{has emerged}} as a significant focus of research and scholarship over the last twenty years, the result of a growing interest in postcolonial societies and cultures and a turn towards visual evidence across the humanities and social sciences. At the same time, many rich and fascinating photographic collections have come to light. This volume explores the complex theoretical and practical issues involved in the study of African photographic archives, based on case studies drawn from across the continent dating from the 19 th century to the present day. Chapters consider what constitutes an archive, from the familiar mission and state archives to more local, vernacular and personal accumulations of photographs; the importance of a critical and reflexive engagement with photographic collections; and the question of where and what is 'Africa', as constructed in the <b>photographic</b> archive. Essential <b>reading</b> for all researchers working with photographic archives, this book consolidates current thinking on the topic and sets the agenda for future research in this field...|$|R
40|$|We {{live in a}} {{world that}} has been seduced by the image. In our {{predominantly}} visual culture we are accustomed to relying on photographs for a myriad of diverse functions, which contribute to and inform the way we see the world around us. Through its images and associated actions, photography has transformed the way the world is discovered, remembered, chronicled and disseminated. This research is motivated by the apparent effect that photography has on our understanding of reality. It concentrates on the photographic practice associated with documentary photography. The practical work pulls apart images, recontextualising and manipulating ‘documentary photographs’ that are sourced from a variety of publications, but most significantly from National Geographic magazines. The aim is to question the status of the photograph as a ‘documentary’ tool intended to record reality by suggesting that it simultaneously contributes to creating that reality. The creative outcomes of this research investigate the uncertainties of visual perception. The way we see and <b>read</b> <b>photographic</b> images is influenced by a variety of factors that are largely beyond our control, not least our own personal preconceptions and expectations that we unwittingly project onto everything we see. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This essay {{considers}} {{the history of}} photography in fiction, concentrat-ing on issues of genre. Starting with a survey of nineteenth-century novels which included physical photographs, the essay moves to twentieth-century novels, dis-cussing {{ways in which the}} generic rules of written narratives influence the relation-ship between word and image and the fictiveness of photographs within novels. Unlike earlier writers, who used photographs for illustration of place, postmodern novelists frequently use photographs as documentation, both in support of and in opposition to the written narrative. The last section of the essay uses W. G. Sebald’s The Emigrants, an especially complicated novel which combines fiction and nonfic-tion, biography and autobiography, as a case study. “Photography is a record of what we see, or a revelation of what we cannot see, a glimpse of what was previously invisible. ” W. J. T. Mitchell, What Do Pictures Want? “Memory heals the scars of time. Photography documents the wounds. ” Michael Ignatieff, The Russian Album The ontological status of photographs has always been ambiguous, their referential power confusing, and their identity vexed. When they appear within works of literature, the situation becomes even more complex because the way we <b>read</b> <b>photographic</b> images has always been influenced by generic rules that govern written narratives. When photographs ar...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{exquisite}} densitometers for {{the measurement of}} the photographic densities of plates and films, but they are too expensive for us and the authors tried with success to construct a simple densitometer by using an ordinary Duboscq-color-imeter. The principle {{is the same as}} when a Duboscq-colorimeter is used for the comparison of two liquids. In our case oue liquid is replaced by a photographic plate and the intensities of the light pencils transmitted through the plate and the standard liquid are matched with each other and the <b>photographic</b> intensity is <b>read</b> from the depth of the standard liquid, for which, after many trials, a suspension of carbon black of a moderate particle size was used with a small quantity of polyvinylalcohol as a stabilizer. As a yellow light filtered only by a solution of K_ 2 Cr_ 2 O_ 7 was used, which was not exactly monochromatic, it was necessary for us to use a carbon black of a moderatetsize, otherwise the color tones of the two light pencils compared do not matchor the suspension is too unstable. The area of the photographic, plate compared was some 0. 8 mm^ 2. The accuracy of the instrument was ascertained to be the same order as that of the ordinary Duboscq-colorimeter...|$|R
5000|$|The pigeons carried {{two kinds}} of despatch: {{official}} and private, {{both of which are}} later described in detail. The service was put into operation for the transmission of information from the Delegation to Paris and was opened to the public in early November. The private despatches were sent only when an official despatch was being sent, since the latter would have absolute priority. However, the introduction of the Dagron microfilms eased any problems there might have been in claims for transport since their volumetric requirements were very small. For example: one tube sent during January contained 21 microfilms, of which 6 were official despatches and 15 were private, while a later tube contained 16 private despatches and 2 official ones. In order to improve the chances of the despatches successfully reaching Paris, the same despatch was sent by several pigeons, one official despatch being repeated 35 times and the later private despatches were repeated on average 22 times. The records show that from 7 January to the end, 61 tubes were sent off, containing 246 official and 671 private despatches. The practice was to send off the despatches not only by pigeons of the same release but also of successive releases until Paris signaled the arrival of those despatches. When the pigeon reached its particular loft in Paris, its arrival was announced by a bell in the trap in the loft. Immediately, a watchman relieved it of its tube which was taken to the Central Telegraph Office where the content was carefully unpacked and placed between two thin sheets of glass. The photographs are said to have been projected by magic lantern on to a screen where the enlargement could be easily read and written down by a team of clerks. This would certainly be true for the microfilms, but the earlier despatches on <b>photographic</b> paper were <b>read</b> through microscopes. The transcribed messages were written out on forms (telegraph forms for private messages, with or without the special annotation [...] "pigeon") and so delivered. The interval between sending a private message and its receipt by the addressee depended on many factors: the density of telegraphic traffic to and from the sender's town, the time taken to register the message, to pass it to the printers where it was assembled with its 3000 companions into a single page, and then to assemble the pages into nines or twelves or sixteens. During the four months of the siege, 150,000 official and 1 million private communications were carried into Paris by this method.|$|R
