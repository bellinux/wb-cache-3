5|$|Filming started {{shortly before}} 7.00pm, and ended at around 8.30pm; Griffin left the {{building}} 10 minutes later. Audience members inside the studios used their mobile <b>phones</b> <b>to</b> relay live information about the recording's progress. James Lyons, political correspondent for the Daily Mirror, wrote that {{the mood in the}} studio turned from anger to mockery of Griffin.|$|E
5|$|On the microeconomic scale, {{companies}} have used telecommunications {{to help build}} global business empires. This is self-evident {{in the case of}} online retailer Amazon.com but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer Walmart has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors. In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In Bangladesh's Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular <b>phones</b> <b>to</b> speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In Côte d'Ivoire, coffee growers share mobile <b>phones</b> <b>to</b> follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the best price.|$|E
5|$|The Route55 freeway, {{like many}} other {{highways}} in New Jersey, once had solar-powered emergency call boxes every mile (about 1.6km); {{the use of the}} call boxes became limited due to the increasing popularity of cell <b>phones.</b> <b>To</b> save on maintenance costs, NJDOT removed these call boxes in 2005.|$|E

5|$|The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus {{received}} positive reviews, with critics {{regarding their}} improved design, specifications, camera, and battery life as being improvements over previous iPhone models. However, {{aspects of the}} design of iPhone 6 were also panned, including plastic strips on {{the rear of the}} device for its antenna that disrupted the otherwise metal exterior, and the screen resolution of the standard-sized iPhone 6 being lower than other devices in its class. Pre-orders of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus exceeded four million within its first 24 hours of availability—an Apple record. More than ten million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices were sold in the first three days, another Apple record. During its lifespan, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sold 220 million in total, {{making it one of the}} most successful <b>phones</b> <b>to</b> date.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, hybrid HMM/ANN {{systems are}} used to model context {{dependent}} <b>phones.</b> In order <b>to</b> {{reduce the number of}} parameters as well as to better catch the dynamics of the phonetic segments, we combine (context dependent) diphone models with context independent phone models. Transitions from <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> <b>phone</b> are modeled as generalized context dependent distributions while phonetic units are context independent models trained on the less coarticulated middle part of each phone. Words are thus modeled as a sequence of probability distributions alternatively representing the middle part of the phonemes and the transitions from <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> <b>phone.</b> A single neural network is used to estimate both context independent phone probabilities and generalized context dependent diphone (<b>phone</b> <b>to</b> <b>phone</b> transition) probabilities. Resulting systems are compared to classical context independent phone-based HMM/ANN systems with the same number of parameters. The Phonebook isolated word database has been used [...] ...|$|R
