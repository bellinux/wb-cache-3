5|$|The {{oxidation}} state +5 {{can be produced}} by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten sodium nitrite. Manganate (VI) salts can be produced by dissolving Mn compounds, such as manganese dioxide, in molten alkali while exposed to air. Permanganate (+7 {{oxidation state}}) compounds are purple, and can give glass a violet color. <b>Potassium</b> <b>permanganate,</b> sodium permanganate, and barium permanganate are all potent oxidizers. <b>Potassium</b> <b>permanganate,</b> also called Condy's crystals, is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties; it {{is used as a}} topical medicine (for example, in the treatment of fish diseases). Solutions of <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> were among the first stains and fixatives {{to be used in the}} preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{hydrochloric}} acid (fuming {{hydrochloric acid}}) forms acidic mists. Both the mist and the solution have a corrosive effect on human tissue, {{with the potential}} to damage respiratory organs, eyes, skin, and intestines irreversibly. Upon mixing hydrochloric acid with common oxidizing chemicals, such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach, NaClO) or <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> (KMnO4), the toxic gas chlorine is produced.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} be {{produced}} by oxidising the ephedrine analogue 4-methylephedrine using <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> dissolved in sulfuric acid. Because 4-methylephedrine can be obtained in a specific enantiomeric form, mephedrone consisting of only one enantiomer can be produced. The danger associated with this method is it may cause manganese poisoning if the product is not correctly purified.|$|E
5|$|Potassium {{compounds}} {{are often}} used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition. Potassium hydroxide {{is a very strong}} base, and is used to control the pH of various substances. Potassium nitrate and <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> {{are often used}} as powerful oxidising agents. Potassium superoxide is used in breathing masks, as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and oxygen gas. Pure potassium metal is not often used, but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors.|$|E
25|$|China fully {{participates in}} the DEA's Operations TOPAZ and PURPLE, which are {{international}} monitoring initiatives that target acetic anhydride and <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate,</b> respectively. Acetic anhydride is used to synthesize morphine base into heroin, and <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> is used as an oxidizer in cocaine production. Both chemicals are targeted {{because they are the}} chemicals most often preferred, and most widely used, by illicit drug manufacturers. However, the effectiveness of Operation PURPLE has been declining recently, since participant nations are exporting significant amounts of <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> to non-participant countries.|$|E
25|$|In histology, <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> {{was used}} as a {{bleaching}} agent.|$|E
25|$|In clandestine laboratories, synthesizing methcathinone using <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> is {{considered}} undesirable {{because of the}} low yields and the high toxicity of this oxidant, however, if done in a proper laboratory using the proper procedures <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> can be a high-yielding reactant. A method that yields more methcathinone is oxidizing (pseudo)ephedrine with chromium (VI) compounds.|$|E
25|$|Oxidative {{cleavage}} of olefins by ozonolysis, <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate,</b> or potassium dichromate.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{manganate}} is {{the precursor}} to <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate,</b> a common oxidant.|$|E
25|$|Lastly {{the action}} of <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> over {{manganese}} sulphate crystals produces the desired oxide.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{dichromate}} is an {{oxidising agent}} in organic chemistry, and is milder than <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate.</b> It {{is used to}} oxidize alcohols. It converts primary alcohols into aldehydes and, under more forcing conditions, into carboxylic acids. In contrast, <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> tends to give carboxylic acids as the sole products. Secondary alcohols are converted into ketones. For example, menthone may be prepared by oxidation of menthol with acidified dichromate. Tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized.|$|E
25|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> is an {{inorganic}} chemical compound and medication. As a medication {{it is used}} for cleaning wounds and dermatitis.|$|E
25|$|Oxidative {{cleavage}} of alkynes proceeds via cycloaddition to metal oxides. Most famously, <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> converts alkynes {{to a pair}} of carboxylic acids.|$|E
25|$|Application of a one-percent {{solution}} of <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> or chromic acid to the cut, exposed area. The latter substance is notably toxic and carcinogenic.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{applications}} of <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> exploit its oxidizing properties. As a strong oxidant {{that does not}} generate toxic byproducts, KMnO4 has many niche uses.|$|E
25|$|In {{basic medium}} OH− ions and water {{are added to}} half {{reactions}} to balance the overall reaction. For example, on reaction between <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> and sodium sulfite.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{manganate}} {{is prepared}} industrially, {{as an intermediate}} to <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate,</b> by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten potassium hydroxide with potassium nitrate or air as the oxidizing agent.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is also a}} convenient way to remove the manganese dioxide precipitate from the ground glass joints after running a reaction (i. e., an oxidation with <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate).</b>|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} reported syntheses of this quinolinic acid was by Zdenko Hans Skraup, who found that methyl-substituted quinolines could be oxidized to quinolinic acid by <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> is {{typically}} included in survival kits: as a fire starter (mixed with antifreeze {{from a car}} radiator or glycerol), water sterilizer, and for creating distress signals on snow.|$|E
25|$|Benzyl {{alcohol is}} refluxed with <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> or other {{oxidizing}} reagents in water. The mixture is hot filtered to remove manganese dioxide and then allowed to cool to afford benzoic acid.|$|E
25|$|New in situ {{oxidation}} {{technologies have}} become popular for remediation {{of a wide}} range of soil and groundwater contaminants. Remediation by chemical oxidation involves the injection of strong oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone gas, <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> or persulfates.|$|E
25|$|Methcathinone {{production}} utilizes the oxidation of pseudoephedrine or ephedrine, {{the former}} being preferred because of much higher yields achieved. Oxidation of pseudoephedrine to methcathinone requires little chemistry experience, making it (relatively) easy to synthesize. <b>Potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> (KMnO4) is {{most commonly used}} as the oxidant.|$|E
25|$|Reagents {{useful for}} the {{transformation}} of primary alcohols to aldehydes are normally also suitable for the oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones. These include Collins reagent and Dess-Martin periodinane. The direct oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids {{can be carried out}} using <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> or the Jones reagent.|$|E
25|$|When {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} is not available, a faster, lower cost technique is <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> staining. The collected eggs are rinsed with a normal saline solution {{and placed in a}} glass petri dish. The eggs are soaked in a 1% <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> solution for one minute and then dehydrated and mounted onto a slide for observation. These slides can be used with any light microscope with a calibrated eyepiece to compare various morphological features. The most important and useful features for identifying eggs are the size, length, and width of the plastron, as well as the morphology of the plastron in the area around the micropyle. The various measurements and observations when compared to standards for forensically important species are used to determine the species of the egg.|$|E
25|$|The formyl group readily oxidizes to the {{corresponding}} carboxyl group (−COOH). The preferred oxidant in industry is oxygen or air. In the laboratory, popular oxidizing agents include <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate,</b> nitric acid, chromium(VI) oxide, and chromic acid. The combination of manganese dioxide, cyanide, acetic acid and methanol will convert the aldehyde to a methyl ester.|$|E
25|$|An {{instance}} of ion-pair extraction {{is in the}} use of a ligand to enable oxidation by <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate,</b> KMnO4, in an organic solvent. KMnO4 is not soluble in organic solvents. When a ligand, such as a crown ether is added to an aqueous solution of KMnO4, it forms a hydrophobic complex with the potassium cation which allows the uncharged ion pair +− to be extracted into the organic solvent. See also: phase-transfer catalysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> {{can be used}} to quantitatively {{determine}} the total oxidisable organic material in an aqueous sample. The value determined is known as the permanganate value. In analytical chemistry, a standardized aqueous solution of KMnO4 is sometimes used as an oxidizing titrant for redox titrations (permanganometry). In a related way, it is used as a reagent to {{determine the}} Kappa number of wood pulp. For the standardization of KMnO4 solutions, reduction by oxalic acid is often used.|$|E
25|$|China is of {{paramount}} importance in global cooperative efforts to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals. With its large chemical industry, China remains a source country for legitimately produced chemicals that are diverted for production of heroin and cocaine, as well as many amphetamine-type stimulants. China and its neighbor India are the leading exporters of bulk ephedrine in the world. China produces over 100,000 metric tons of acetic anhydride each year, and imports an additional 20,000 metric tons from the United States and Singapore. China is also the second largest producer of <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> in the world.|$|E
25|$|This {{step was}} then {{repeated}} in the third step. The plutonium was reduced again by adding ferrous ammonium sulfate. Bismuth nitrate and phosphoric acid were added and bismuth phosphate precipitated. It was dissolved in nitric acid and the bismuth phosphate was precipitated. This step resulted in reducing the gamma radiation by four more orders of magnitude, so the plutonium-bearing solution now had 100,000-th of the original gamma radiation. The plutonium solution was transferred from the 224 buildings to the 221 buildings, through underground pipes. In the fourth step, phosphoric acid was added and the bismuth phosphate precipitated and removed; <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> was added to oxidize the plutonium.|$|E
25|$|The {{second step}} was to {{separate}} the plutonium from the uranium and the fission products. Bismuth nitrate and phosphoric acid were added, producing bismuth phosphate, which was precipitated carrying the plutonium with it. This was {{very similar to the}} lanthanum fluoride process, in which lanthanum fluoride was used as the carrier. The precipitate was removed from the solution with a centrifuge and the liquid discharged as waste. Getting rid of the fission products reduced the gamma radiation by 90 percent. The precipitate was a plutonium-containing cake which was placed in another tank and dissolved in nitric acid. Sodium bismuthate or <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> was added to oxidize the plutonium. Plutonium would be carried by the bismuth phosphate in the tetravalent state but not in the hexavalent state. The bismuth phosphate would then be precipitated as a by product, leaving the plutonium behind in solution.|$|E
25|$|Gunther is an Australian of German and Scots ancestry, born in Melbourne on 15 August 1950. He {{attended}} Preston East Primary School from 1955 to 1956, and Balwyn North Primary School from 1956 until 1962. For his tenth birthday, Gunther {{received a}} copy of the now famous book entitled The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments from an older cousin. Inspired by the book, he started working on various experiments, making use of various chemicals that could be found around in his house. After he spilled some <b>potassium</b> <b>permanganate</b> solution on his bedroom carpet his mother confined him to an alcove in the garage which he turned into a small laboratory, replete with industrial chemicals and second-hand laboratory glassware. Gunther was interested in finding out how things like detergents and oils were composed by cracking them in his fractionating column. He took particular interest in mixing paints for his art classes, as well as his chemistry classes in Balwyn High School. His father, being the Superintendent of Melbourne's electrical power station, borrowed an organic chemistry text from the chemists in the quality control laboratory. This ultimately led to an intense interest in synthesizing Azo dyes. At around age 14, Gunther attempted to predict the color of azo dyes based on the chromophore-auxochrome combination. Apart from drawing up empirical tables, this effort was largely unsuccessful due to his lack of knowledge of quantum theory.|$|E
