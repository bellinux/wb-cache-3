40|$|LectureIn 2014 a {{full scale}} high {{viscosity}} pump performance test was performed for a 2 -stage vertically suspended (VS 1) API 610 pump. The high viscosity test scope {{was part of}} an ongoing EPC project and exclusively conducted for industrial purposes. The objective was to simulate real field operation with crude oil and qualify the pump for the given field conditions and requirements. Furthermore, the reason for conducting this test scope was the uncertainties in published methods of predicting high viscosity fluid <b>pump</b> <b>characteristics,</b> limited available literature, hence reduce field operation risks. The official test scope was divided into two main scenarios: 1) Start-up test at minimum. flow and a viscosity of 3075 cP, 2) Pump performance test with an intermittent duty point (reduced flow) of 850 m 3 /h- 125 m (3654 USgpm- 410 ft), and a viscosity of 1075 cP. Internal tests with various viscosities from 480 cP to 3075 cP were also done in preparation for the official tests. Measured results were then compared to published methods for <b>pump</b> <b>characteristics</b> viscosity correction. The objective for these additional analyzes was to evaluate possible alternative approaches in order to improve uncertainties with viscous prediction and ultimately reduce the number of tests/test scope in future projects. It should be emphasized that this comparison is simply for discussion within the industry and not for validation of published methods of viscosity correction for <b>pump</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The test results provide valuable insight on the effects of high viscosity on centrifugal pump performance curves, allowing a more accurate rating and possibly a better optimization of the process equipment, e. g. electrical motor, valves, cooling system, by improving the flow characteristics predictions...|$|E

The program has been further developed during the work with this thesis, {{as well as in}} the author's preceding project thesis, giving key information for an existing pump design. The aim of this Master's thesis has been to verify the calculation of <b>pump</b> <b>characteristics</b> and velocity profiles at the impeller outlet through testing. A detailed description of the relevant theory regarding pump design has been presented, and different calculation models for the <b>pump</b> <b>characteristics</b> have been examined. The analytical approaches for calculating the performance data have been implemented into Matlab, and a comparison of the different calculation models has been performed. A multistage centrifugal pump has been used for verifying the velocity profiles, and the <b>pump</b> <b>characteristics</b> have been compared to the different calculation models presented in Matlab. Measurements of the velocity profiles were carried out in Typhonix' laboratories at Varhaug using a pitot-static probe. The results achieved from the comparison of the characteristic curves calculated in Matlab showed that the models provide quite different results. Some of the methods widely used in the literature proved to deviate significantly from the measured results, while other and more advanced methods provided better results. The results achieved from testing the velocity profiles with the pitot-static probe were not as good as desired. The measured velocities and flow angles did not correlate well with the analytical solutions, and the results are partly unreliable. Some of the trends regarding changes due to increased volume flow or rotational speed were found, but the exact values could not be trusted. The pitot-static probe is an intrusive method, and it probably disturbed the flow in a way making good results difficult to achieve. </p...|$|E
