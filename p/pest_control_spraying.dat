40|$|The study assesses farmers’ {{perceptions}} {{and willingness to}} pay for a biopesticide developed from Metarhizium anisopliae a fungi. A sample of 400 conventional and organic cotton producers was randomly selected in cotton producing zones in Benin and interviewed for their perceptions on the efficacy of the biopesticide and the likely prices they {{are willing to pay for}} the product to <b>control</b> a major <b>pest</b> like Helicoverpa armigera or cotton bollworm causing substantial crop losses. An econometric model (Logit) is used to identify factors highly likely to affect farmer’s willingness to purchase the product. The results show that Helicoverpa armigera or cotton bollworm is perceived by farmers as the most severe pest with losses reaching up to 100 %. Farmers attribute the current pest intensity to a number of factors including ineffectiveness of chemical pesticides, delay in access to input mainly fertilizers and the development of refuge host plants for cotton pests. The results also show that most cotton producers and their households members are exposed to chemical insecticides without adequate protection devices during the <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> <b>sprays.</b> Both organic and conventional cotton producers have expressed a significant interest in the use of Metarhizium to control Helicoverpa on cotton.

Yet the recipes are not standardized and the products vary in quality and concentration of the active ingredients. bioRe®, together with the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL), engages in research activities to address this challenge and constantly improve pest management strategies in organic farming. The research activities are carried out as a combination of on-station trials and participatory on-farm trials with the farmers. During the cotton cropping season 2013 - 14 one on-station and two on-farm trials were conducted {{with the objective of}} comparing different spraying intervals of the most commonly used self-made organic <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> products in order to identify an optimum level of crop protection. The study focused on the effect of the spraying intervals on the most important sucking pests (Cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii), Cotton jassid (Amrasca biguttula biguttula), Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), Cotton mealy bug (Phenacoccus solenopsis) and Thrips (Thripidae)). Besides sucking pest incidences, data on plant stress symptoms and yield formation as well as economic parameters were also collected. Additionally, on-station trials were established to investigate different measures of early stage crop protection and to evaluate specific effects of three self-made products (Garlic-Onion-Chilli extract, Top Ten and Neem seed extract) against certain sucking pests. The products were prepared according to recipes standardized by bioRe® after careful research and hands-on experience of its associated scientists and extension workers. This knowledge was reproduced in pictorial technical leaflets which are easy-to-understand for the local farmers. A total of 11 leaflets - on seed treatments (2), early stage protection measures (1), <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> <b>sprays</b> (6), effective spraying technique (1) and growth promoter (1) were designed in both English and Hindi and will be used for dissemination activities. On-station results were inconclusive due to a low pest pressure in this year’s cotton season, as well as the small size of on-station trial plots. Results of on-farm trials revealed that a suitable strategy for in-field pest monitoring is needed for farmers to determine how often and at what time point <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> interventions are indicated. Further research is needed to understand the specific effects of home-made products on the different insect species. Optimized dosage and application techniques have to be worked out along with other options for integrated <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> (e. g. bird perches, border crops, soil enhancement practices) which could reduce the frequency of time-consuming spraying practices.

40|$|In this study, three apple {{orchards}} in Chungnam {{were selected}} to review pesticide sprayings conditions, pesticide deposit amounts, and <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> effects while <b>spraying</b> different spray water volumes by the customary methods. In the first orchard, the spray water volume of acetamiprid 8 % WP targeting moths used in 2014 was 372 L/ 10 a and the one used in 2015 was 302 L/ 10 a, i. e. by about 70 L smaller {{as compared to the}} previous year; however, no difference in the control value was observed. Meanwhile, for control of A. citricola, acetamiprid 2. 5 % wettable powder was used; the spray water volume used in 2014 was 453 L/ 10 a and the one used in 2015 was 378 L/ 10 a, i. e. by about 70 L smaller as compared to the previous year. The well–sprayed sections showed <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> effects not lower than 95 %, while the poorly <b>sprayed</b> sections showed <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> effects of about 78 %. In the second and third orchards, the <b>control</b> target <b>pest</b> was G. molesta and the spraying pesticide used was acetamiprid 8 % WP. The spray water volumes used {{in the second and third}} orchards were about 349 L and 378 L, respectively, and there was no problem in the control values. For control of A. citricola, imidacloprid 10 % wettable powder and flonicamid 10 % water–dispersible granules were used as spraying pesticides. The spray water volumes of these two pesticides were 355 L and 380 L per 10 a, respectively, i. e. smaller than the reference volumes; however, no problem in the overall <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> was observed.

40|$|Due to the {{benefits}} of diversity, autonomous ecosystem management and careful farmers' stewardship, <b>pest</b> and disease <b>control</b> doesn't pose a profound problem in ecological agriculture practice. However, during the conversion period, and in ecological horticulture, particularly in fruit growing, this preventive control is often not sufficient enough, and additional <b>control,</b> mostly (curative) <b>spraying</b> is needed. This need for additional <b>pest</b> and disease <b>control</b> (<b>spraying)</b> in ecological horticulture, may be linked with our incomplete {{understanding of the role}} of those subsystems in the agro-ecosystem as a whole. Currently, organic standards normally do specify permitted (environmental friendly, mainly natural substances), prohibited (synthetic pesticides), and sprays whose use is restricted (like natural, broad spectrum pesticides). Unfortunately, the list of, and the elaboration on these sprays, differ even between those standards (or standards of the same organisation in different countries) which are perceived as mutually compatible. This incompatibility indicates that {{there is a lack of}} both practical and theoretical certainty in regard to this matter. This situation results in an expand of countless anonymous "recipes" of "eco-sprays" with questionable effectiveness. Therefore, this paper tries to cast some more light on the types, origin, formulation, mode of action, efficiency and environmental effects of some most common eco-sprays. Additionally, constraints for their practical use and further improvement, which are not primarily of technological, but rather of economic, juridical (regulative) and ethical nature are discussed. Once these, non technological constraints were lifted, due to their great pesticide potential, as demonstrated in numerous relevant studies, "eco-sprays" could become much more reliable than now. Such accurate "eco-sprays" would than serve as a tool which offers more assurance to ecological fruit growers and eco-farmers, particularly during conversion period. Therefore, in order to facilitate the elimination of current barriers for more productive use of "eco-sprays", it is deemed essential to establish an international network (IFOAM task force) which should stimulate a dialogue on these issues between farmers, scientists, industry and policy makers worldwide. ...|$|R

40|$|Aphids are a {{major concern}} in {{agricultural}} crops worldwide, and control by natural enemies is {{an essential component of}} the ecological intensification of agriculture. Although the complexity of agricultural landscapes is known to influence natural enemies of pests, few studies have measured the degree of <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> by different enemy guilds across gradients in landscape complexity. Here, we use multiple natural-enemy exclosures replicated in 18 fields across a gradient in landscape complexity to investigate (1) the strength of natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> across landscapes, measured as the difference between pest pressure in the presence {{and in the absence of}} natural enemies; (2) the differential contributions of natural enemy guilds to <b>pest</b> <b>control,</b> and the nature of their interactions across landscapes. We show that natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> of aphids increased up to six-fold from simple to complex landscapes. In the absence of <b>pest</b> <b>control,</b> aphid population growth was higher in complex than simple landscapes, but was reduced by natural enemies to similar growth rates across all landscapes. The effects of enemy guilds were landscape-dependent. Particularly in complex landscapes, total <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> was supplied by the combined contribution of flying insects and ground-dwellers. Birds had little overall impact on aphid control. Despite evidence for intraguild predation of flying insects by ground-dwellers and birds, the overall effect of enemy guilds on aphid control was complementary. Understanding <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> services at large spatial scales is critical to increase the success of ecological intensification schemes. Our results suggest that, where aphids are the main pest of concern, interactions between natural enemies are largely complementary and lead to a strongly positive effect of landscape complexity on <b>pest</b> <b>control.</b> Increasing the availability of seminatural habitats in agricultural landscapes may thus benefit not only natural enemies, but also the effectiveness of aphid natural <b>pest</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Products {{containing}} biocides {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes in the home environment. To assess potential health risks, data on products containing biocides were gathered by means of a market survey, exposures were estimated using a worst case scenario approach (screening), the hazard of the active components were evaluated, and a preliminary risk assessment was conducted. Methods Information on biocide-containing products was collected by on-site research, by an internet inquiry as well as research into databases and lists of active substances. Twenty active substances were selected for detailed investigation. The products containing these substances were subsequently classified by range of application; typical concentrations were derived. Potential exposures were then estimated using a worst case scenario approach according to the European Commission's Technical Guidance Document on Risk Assessment. Relevant combinations of scenarios and active substances were identified. The toxicological data for these substances were compiled in substance dossiers. For estimating risks, the margins of exposure (MOEs) were determined. Results Numerous consumer products were found to contain biocides. However, it appeared that {{only a limited number of}} biocidal active substances or groups of biocidal active substances were being used. The lowest MOEs for dermal exposure or exposure by inhalation were obtained for the following scenarios and biocides: indoor <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> using <b>sprays,</b> stickers or evaporators (chlorpyrifos, dichlorvos) and spraying of disinfectants as well as cleaning of surfaces with concentrates (hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, glutardialdehyde). The risk from aggregate exposure to individual biocides via different exposure scenarios was higher than the highest single exposure on average by a factor of three. From the 20 biocides assessed 10 had skin-sensitizing properties. The biocides isothiazolinone (mixture of 5 -chloro- 2 -methyl- 2 H-isothiazolin- 3 -one and 2 -methyl- 2 H-isothiazolin- 3 -one, CMI/MI), glutardialdehyde, formaldehyde and chloroacetamide may be present in household products in concentrations which have induced sensitization in experimental studies. Conclusions Exposure to biocides from household products may contribute to induction of sensitization in the population. The use of biocides in consumer products should be carefully evaluated.

40|$|Numerous {{studies show}} that {{landscape}} simplification reduces abundance and diversity of natural enemies in agroecosystems, but its effect on natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> remains poorly quantified. Further, natural enemy impacts on pest populations have usually been estimated for {{a limited number of}} taxa and have not considered interactions among predator species. In a quantitative synthesis with data collected from several cropping systems in Europe and North America, we analyzed how the level and within-field spatial stability of natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> services was related to the simplification of the surrounding landscape. All studies used aphids as a model species and exclusion cages to measure aphid <b>pest</b> <b>control.</b> Landscape simplification was quantified by the proportion of cultivated land within a 1 km radius around each plot. We found a consistent negative effect of landscape simplification on the level of natural <b>pest</b> <b>control,</b> despite interactions among enemies. Average level of <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> was 46 % lower in homogeneous landscapes dominated by cultivated land, as compared with more complex landscapes. Landscape simplification did not affect the amount of positive or negative interactions among ground dwelling and vegetation-dwelling predators, or the within-field stability of <b>pest</b> <b>control.</b> Our synthesis demonstrates that agricultural intensification through landscape simplification has negative effects on the level of natural <b>pest</b> <b>control</b> with important implications for management to maintain and enhance ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.
