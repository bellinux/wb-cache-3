We also show that the only rotors in this Clifford Algebra, when interpreted as transformations on R 3, are rotations, reflections, <b>perspective</b> <b>projections</b> and their composites. ...|$|R

25|$|Claudius Ptolemy (90–168) thought that, {{with the}} aid of {{astronomy}} and mathematics, the earth could be mapped very accurately. Ptolemy revolutionized the depiction of the spherical earth on a map by using <b>perspective</b> <b>projection,</b> and suggested precise methods for fixing the position of geographic features on its surface using a coordinate system with parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude.|$|E
25|$|Euler's {{formula is}} also valid for convex polyhedra. This is no coincidence: every convex {{polyhedron}} {{can be turned}} into a connected, simple, planar graph by using the Schlegel diagram of the polyhedron, a <b>perspective</b> <b>projection</b> of the polyhedron onto a plane with the center of perspective chosen near the center of one of the polyhedron's faces. Not every planar graph corresponds to a convex polyhedron in this way: the trees do not, for example. Steinitz's theorem says that the polyhedral graphs formed from convex polyhedra are precisely the finite 3-connected simple planar graphs. More generally, Euler's formula applies to any polyhedron whose faces are simple polygons that form a surface topologically equivalent to a sphere, regardless of its convexity.|$|E

50|$|These are two <b>perspective</b> <b>projections,</b> {{projecting}} the polytope into a hypersphere, {{and applying}} a stereographic projection into 3-space.|$|R
50|$|Tilted <b>Perspective</b> <b>projections</b> are not {{azimuthal}} (see second figure below); directions are {{not true}} from the central point, and the projection plane is not tangent to the sphere.|$|R
500|$|The {{mathematics}} of tessellation, polyhedra, {{shaping of}} space, and self-reference provided the graphic artist M. C. Escher (1898—1972) with a lifetime's worth of materials for his woodcuts. In the Alhambra Sketch, Escher showed that {{art can be}} created with polygons or regular shapes such as triangles, squares, and hexagons. Escher used irregular polygons when tiling the plane and often used reflections, glide reflections, and translations to obtain further patterns. Many of his works contain impossible constructions, made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between <b>perspective</b> <b>projection</b> and three dimensions, but are pleasant to the human sight. Escher's Ascending and Descending {{is based on the}} [...] "impossible staircase" [...] created by the medical scientist Lionel Penrose and his son the mathematician Roger Penrose.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{approach}} is to embed the higher-dimensional objects in three-dimensional space, using methods analogous {{to the ways in}} which three-dimensional objects are drawn on the plane. For example, the fold out nets mentioned in the previous section have higher-dimensional equivalents. Some of these may be viewed at [...] One might even imagine building a model of this fold-out net, as one draws a polyhedron's fold-out net on a piece of paper. Sadly, we could never do the necessary folding of the 3-dimensional structure to obtain the 4-dimensional polytope because of the constraints of the physical universe. Another way to [...] "draw" [...] the higher-dimensional shapes in 3 dimensions is via some kind of projection, for example, the analogue of either orthographic or <b>perspective</b> <b>projection.</b> Coxeter's famous book on polytopes (Coxeter, 1948) has some examples of such orthographic projections. Other examples may be found on the web (see for example [...] ). Note that immersing even 4-dimensional polychora directly into two dimensions is quite confusing. Easier to understand are 3-d models of the projections. Such models are occasionally found in science museums or mathematics departments of universities (such as that of the Université Libre de Bruxelles).|$|E
5000|$|Mathematically, the {{difference}} between artificial <b>perspective</b> <b>projection</b> (<b>perspective</b> <b>projection</b> onto a flat surface) and natural <b>perspective</b> <b>projection</b> (<b>perspective</b> <b>projection</b> onto a spherical surface) is a distortion resulting from {{the difference}} {{in the size of the}} projection on a concave surface like the retina, on which real objects are projected, vs. a flat one situated frontally and at a unitary distance from an observer, depending on the visual angle that encompasses the object(s), in the following overall percentages: ...|$|E

Otherwise, a Tilted <b>Perspective</b> <b>projection</b> is obtained.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "weak" [...] <b>perspective</b> <b>projection</b> {{uses the}} same {{principles}} of an orthographic projection, but requires the scaling factor to be specified, thus ensuring that closer objects appear bigger in the projection, and vice versa. It {{can be seen as}} a hybrid between an orthographic and a <b>perspective</b> <b>projection,</b> and described either as a <b>perspective</b> <b>projection</b> with individual point depths [...] replaced by an average constant depth , or simply as an orthographic projection plus a scaling.|$|E

50|$|When using affine transformations, the {{homogeneous}} {{component of}} a coordinate vector (normally called w) will never be altered. One can therefore safely assume that it is always 1 and ignore it. However, {{this is not true}} when using <b>perspective</b> <b>projections.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{projection}}, orthographic (also called parallel) and <b>perspective</b> <b>projection.</b> Orthographic projection is used to represent a 3D model in a two dimensional (2D) space. The main characteristic of orthographic projection is that the parallel lines remain parallel even after the transformation without distorting them. <b>Perspective</b> <b>projection</b> is when a camera is farther away from the model, the smaller the model it appears. Essentially, <b>perspective</b> <b>projection</b> is the way that we see things from our eyes.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{distortion}} induced by the spherical projection, we compute the above mentioned feature descriptors on an atlas of rectified images (shown in Figure 4). This is possible since both the spherical projection and the atlas <b>perspective</b> <b>projections</b> will share the same point of view.|$|R
50|$|Real human {{vision and}} <b>perspective</b> <b>projection</b> should (unless it is {{otherwise}} desired) look the same. The difference should be imperceptible. The base {{to rate the}} quality of the <b>perspective</b> <b>projection</b> is the real vision and the difference between them is the <b>perspective</b> <b>projection</b> distortion. Normal human vision should not be considered to present any distortion unless a disturbing factor is involved. Distortion in human vision appears when there is a visual problem involved. The use of lenses can also cause, modify or avoid these distortions. In photography a lens may magnify distortion.|$|E
5000|$|It {{also means}} that lines which are {{parallel}} in nature (that is, meet at the point at infinity) appear to intersect in the projected image, for example if railways are pictured with <b>perspective</b> <b>projection,</b> they appear to converge towards a single point, called vanishing point. Photographic lenses and the human eye {{work in the same}} way, therefore <b>perspective</b> <b>projection</b> looks most realistic.
