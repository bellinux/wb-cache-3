5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} {{the ethics of}} humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> theory. He argues {{that there is a}} duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially no different to humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired. He argues that libertarian <b>property</b> <b>rights,</b> consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his theory of animal <b>property</b> <b>rights,</b> {{according}} to which animals should be afforded <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> over their territory. Hadley has developed his theory of animal <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> through his doctoral research, his 2015 monograph, and other academic works. In addition, he has authored popular articles on the subject for The Guardian, The Conversation and The Ethics Centre. He also discussed the topic on Knowing Animals, a podcast series produced by Siobhan O'Sullivan. His proposal has received attention in the popular press, with strong criticism from farmers' groups and journalists writing on rural affairs.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> over their territories, and that guardians be {{appointed}} to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E

Since the tribes had the right to fish reserved in the treaties, the federal government and subsequent owners had no greater <b>property</b> <b>rights</b> than were granted by the treaties.|$|E
