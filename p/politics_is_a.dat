5|$|Political Animals and Animal <b>Politics</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 2014 edited {{collection}} {{published by}} Palgrave Macmillan and edited by the green political theorists Marcel Wissenburg and David Schlosberg. The volume addresses {{the emergence of}} academic animal ethics informed by political philosophy (as opposed to moral philosophy), {{and was the first}} edited collection to be published on the topic, as well as the first book-length attempt to explore the limits of the literature. As well as a substantial introduction by the editors, it features ten sole-authored chapters split over three parts, with contributions from Wissenburg, Schlosberg, Manuel Arias-Maldonado, Chad Flanders, Christie Smith, Clemens Driessen, Simon Otjes, Kurtis Boyer, Per-Anders Svärd and Mihnea Tanasescu.|$|E

The {{position is}} held by the leader of the party not in government that has the most seats in the House. When in parliament, the Leader of the Opposition sits on the left-hand side of the centre table, in front of the Opposition and opposite the Prime Minister. The Opposition Leader is elected by his or her party according to its rules. A new Opposition Leader may be elected when the incumbent dies, resigns, or is challenged for the leadership.|$|E

25|$|Economics per se, as {{a social}} science, is {{independent}} of the political acts of any government or other decision-making organization, however, many policymakers or individuals holding highly ranked positions that can influence other people's lives are known for arbitrarily using a plethora of economic concepts and rhetoric as vehicles to legitimize agendas and value systems, and do not limit their remarks to matters relevant to their responsibilities. The close relation of economic theory and practice with <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> focus of contention that may shade or distort the most unpretentious original tenets of economics, and is often confused with specific social agendas and value systems.|$|E
500|$|At {{the heart}} of New Age <b>Politics</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{critique}} of the consciousness we all supposedly share, a [...] "six-sided prison" [...] that has kept us all trapped for hundreds of years. [...] The six sides of the [...] "prison" [...] are said to be: patriarchal attitudes, egocentricity, scientific single vision, the bureaucratic mentality, nationalism (xenophobia), and the [...] "big city outlook" [...] (fear of nature). [...] Since consciousness, according to Satin, ultimately determines our institutions, prison consciousness {{is said to be}} ultimately responsible for [...] "monolithic" [...] institutions that offer us {{little in the way of}} freedom of choice or connection with others. [...] Some representative monolithic institutions are: bureaucratic government, automobile-centered transportation systems, attorney-centered law, doctor-centered health care, and church-centered spirituality.|$|E
500|$|Gil {{describes}} his attitude towards politics thus: [...] "I'd rather see my {{position in the}} government as that of an administrator or manager. But <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> necessary ingredient." [...] His political career began in 1987, {{when he was elected}} to a local post in Bahia and became the Salvador secretary of culture. In 1988, {{he was elected to the}} city council and subsequently became city commissioner for environmental protection. However, he left the office after one term and declined to run for the National Congress of Brazil. In 1990, Gil left the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and joined the Green Party. During this period, Gil founded the environmental protection organization Onda Azul (Blue Wave), which worked to protect Brazilian waters. He maintained a full-time musical career at the same time, and withdrew temporarily from politics in 1992, following the release Parabolicamará, considered to be one of his most successful efforts. On October 16, 2001 Gil accepted his nomination to be a Goodwill Ambassador for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, having promoted the organization before his appointment.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} work as [...] "entertaining, {{thoughtful}} and eminently readable", although some thought it was too mournful in places. Separating Shelley's travel memoir from the new guidebooks and handbooks, reviews such as that from the Atlas, praised her [...] "rich fancy, her intense love of nature, and her sensitive apprehension {{of all that is}} good, and beautiful and free". They praised its independence of thought, wit, and feeling. Shelley's commentary on the social and political life of Italy, which was generally thought superior to the German sections, caused one reviewer to call the book the work of [...] "a woman who thinks for herself on all subjects, and who dares to say what she thinks", a woman with a [...] "masculine and original mind". Not all reviewers celebrated her independence of mind. The Observer wrote: [...] "With her, as with all women, <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> matter of the heart, and not as with the more robust nature of man, of the head... It is an idle and unprofitable theme for a woman." [...] Most of the reviews responded positively to Shelley's political aims; those that were unsympathetic to her political position generally disputed her specific claims. For example, one reviewer claimed that Italy had been improved by Austrian rule.|$|E

When Newsweek asked Graham whether ministers—whether they {{think of themselves as}} evangelists, pastors or a bit of both—should spend time engaged with politics, he replied: 'You know, I think in a way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the Lord. A lot of things that I commented on years ago would not have been of the Lord, I'm sure, but I think you have some—like communism, or segregation, on which I think you have a responsibility to speak out.'" ...|$|E

[...] He also said that the rally was only the beginning, adding: [...] "This is a rebirth for us, for our country and our children. We will revolt against injustice." [...] He said that the April constitutional referendum that had eliminated the post of prime minister and greatly expanded the powers of the presidency was [...] "unlawful" [...] (the changes take effect in 2019). Because the state of emergency was in place when the referendum was carried out, Kılıçdaroğlu said that [...] "all public resources were exploited to manipulate the outcome".|$|E

Howard adopted historical details concerning the real Henry's madness into his performance, presenting the character as constantly {{on the brink of}} a mental and emotional breakdown. Possibly as a reaction to a recent adaptation of the trilogy under the general title Wars of the Roses, which was strongly political, Hands attempted to ensure his own production was entirely apolitical; [...] "Wars of the Roses was a study in power politics: its central image was the conference table, and Warwick, the scheming king-maker, was the central figure.

It is funny enough, but my pottering verses are usually made (like the God-gifted organ voice's) at the autumnal; and this seems to hold at the Antipodes. There is here some odd secret of Nature. I cannot speak of politics; we wait and wonder. It seems (this is partly a guess) Ide won't take the C. J. ship, unless the islands are disarmed; and that England hesitates and holds off. By my own idea, strongly corroborated by Sir George, I am writing no more letters. But I have put as many irons in against this folly of the disarming as I could manage. It did not reach my ears till nearly too late. What a risk to take! What an expense to incur! And for how poor a gain! Apart from the treachery of it.

As a rule they were a nuisance and a weariness to the flesh, but {{there were times when}} they verged on the picturesque. There was the famous occasion when they enlivened and diversified the customary pageantry of the Royal progress to open Parliament by letting loose thousands of parrots, which had been carefully trained to scream ‘Votes for women,’ and which circled round his Majesty’s coach in a clamorous cloud of green, and grey and scarlet. It was really rather a striking episode from the spectacular point of view; unfortunately, however, for its devisers, the secret of their intentions had not been well kept, and their opponents let loose at the same moment a rival swarm of parrots, which screeched ‘I don’t think’ and other hostile cries, thereby robbing the demonstration of the unanimity which alone could have made it politically impressive. In the process of recapture the birds learned a quantity of additional language which unfitted them for further service in the Suffragette cause; some of the green ones were secured by ardent Home Rule propagandists and trained to disturb the serenity of Orange meetings by pessimistic reflections on Sir Edward Carson’s destination in the life to come. In fact, the bird in <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> factor that seems to have come to stay; quite recently, at a political gathering held in a dimly-lighted place of worship, the congregation gave a respectful hearing for nearly ten minutes to a jackdaw from Wapping, under the impression that they were listening to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was late in arriving.” ...|$|E
60|$|In {{another matter}} a {{departure}} {{has been made}} from the conservative spirit of the Constitution. This departure is equally grave with the other, {{but it is one}} which certainly does admit of correction. I allude to the present position assumed by many of the Senators, and to the instructions given to them by the State legislatures as to the votes which they shall give in the Senate. An obedience on their part to such instructions is equal in its effects to the introduction of universal suffrage into the elections. It makes them hang upon the people, divests them of their personal responsibility, takes away all those advantages given to them by a six years' certain tenure of office, and annuls the safety secured by a conservative method of election. Here again I must declare my opinion that this democratic practice has crept into the Senate without any expressed wish of the people. In all such matters the people of the nation has been strangely undemonstrative. It has been done as part of a system which has been used for transferring the political power of the nation to a body of trading politicians who have become known and felt as a mass, and not known and felt as individuals. I find it difficult to describe the present political position of the States in this respect. The millions of the people are eager for the Constitution, are proud of their power as a nation, and are ambitious of national greatness. But they are not, as I think, especially desirous of retaining political influences in their own hands. At many of the elections it is difficult to induce them to vote. They have among them a half-knowledge that <b>politics</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> trade {{in the hands of the}} lawyers, and that they are the capital by which those political tradesmen carry on their business. These politicians are all lawyers. Politics and law go together as naturally as the possession of land and the exercise of magisterial powers do with us. It may be well that it should be so, as the lawyers are the best-educated men of the country, and need not necessarily be the most dishonest. Political power has come into their hands, and it is for their purposes and by their influences that the spread of democracy has been encouraged.|$|E
