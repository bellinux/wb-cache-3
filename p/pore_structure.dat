25|$|MIL-101, a large-cavity MOF {{having the}} formula , is a cyanosilylation catalyst. The coordinated water {{molecules}} in MIL-101 are easily removed to expose Cr(III) sites. As one might expect, given the greater Lewis acidity of Cr(III) vs. Cu(II), MIL-101 {{is much more}} active than HKUST-1 {{as a catalyst for}} the cyanosilylation of aldehydes. Additionally, the Kaskel group observed that the catalytic sites of MIL-101, in contrast to those of HKUST-1, are immune to unwanted reduction by benzaldehyde. The Lewis-acid-catalyzed cyanosilylation of aromatic aldehydes has also been carried out by Long and co-workers using a MOF of the formula Mn3. This material contains a three-dimensional <b>pore</b> <b>structure,</b> with the pore diameter equaling 10 Å. In principle, either of the two types of Mn(II) sites could function as a catalyst. Noteworthy features of this catalyst are high conversion yields (for small substrates) and good substrate-size-selectivity, consistent with channellocalized catalysis.|$|E
30|$|Although {{the complex}} <b>pore</b> <b>structures</b> of solid {{particles}} have important effects on CWS preparation and combustion properties of modified coals, the present researchers mostly focused on qualitative analysis of <b>pore</b> <b>structures</b> (Yavuz et al. 1998; Burdukov et al. 2002; Tahmasebi et al. 2012). The special {{attention has been}} paid to the relationship of the fractal dimensions and the coal <b>pore</b> <b>structures</b> such as volume distribution and porosity (Lee and Pyun 2005; Mahamud and Novo 2008 a, b), but most studies are concentrated on the change of fractal dimensions with <b>pore</b> <b>structures</b> in brown coals (Mahamud et al. 2004; Yao et al. 2009; Ge et al. 2013). However, the effects of <b>pore</b> fractal <b>structures</b> on the rheological behavior and combustion kinetics of modified brown coal water slurries (CWSs) were seldom reported. Based on the fractal theory, it is valuable to quantitatively evaluate the complicated and nonlinear porosity of coal particles, and clarify the impacts of surface fractal dimensions (D) on modified CWSs properties.|$|R

25|$|Phase {{separation}} {{allows for}} three-dimensional sub-micrometre fiber scaffolds {{to be created}} {{without the use of}} specialized equipment. The five steps involved in phase separation are polymer dissolution, phase separation and gelation, solvent extraction from the gel, freezing and freeze drying in water. The final product is a continuous fiber network. Phase separation can be modified to fit many different applications, and <b>pore</b> <b>structure</b> can be varied by using different solvents, which can change the entire process from liquid–liquid to solid–liquid. Porosity and fiber diameter can also be modified by varying the initial concentration of the polymer; a higher initial concentration leads to less pores and larger fiber diameters. This technique can be used to create networks of fibers with diameters reaching type I collagen fiber diameters. The fibrous network created is randomly oriented and so far work has not been done to attempt to organize the fibers. Phase separation is a widely used technique for creating highly porous nanofibrous scaffolds with ease.|$|E

Their microstructure is not well defined in the literature, but generally follows the typical elongatoolithid pattern: The eggshell is arranged into two structural layers (the mammillary layer and the continuous layer). The continuous layer forms the outer part of the eggshell; its eggshell units are fused together so that the layer {{appears to be a}} continuum. The inner layer, known as the mammillary, or cone, layer is made up of cone-shaped structures that form the base of the eggshell units. In Macroolithus, the continuous layer is two to three times thicker than the mammillary layer. The eggs have great diversity of <b>pore</b> <b>structure.</b> Since gas conductance is related to the pore size and density this could imply that the eggs were laid in variable environments.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBimodal support {{modified}} Cu-Fe based catalysts {{with different}} <b>pore</b> <b>structures</b> were prepared and tested for higher alcohols synthesis (HAS).

In particular, both the activity and C 2 +OH selectivity presented an increasing trend with the gradual decrease in bimodal support pore sizes. The characterization results indicated that decreasing support pore sizes resulted in the increase of BET surface area and dispersion of active Cu and Fe species inside the <b>pore</b> <b>structures,</b> which increased the bimetallic active sites and strengthened probably the synergistic effect of Cu-Fe via “confine effect” of bimodal <b>pore</b> <b>structures,</b> improving the HAS catalytic activity and shifting product distribution towards higher alcohols...|$|R

2500|$|Zeolites are the {{aluminosilicate}} {{members of}} the family of microporous solids known as [...] "molecular sieves" [...] mainly consisting of Si, Al, O, and metals including Ti, Sn, Zn, and so on. The term molecular sieve refers to a particular property of these materials, i.e., the ability to selectively sort molecules based primarily on a size exclusion process. This is due to a very regular <b>pore</b> <b>structure</b> of molecular dimensions. The maximum size of the molecular or ionic species that can enter the pores of a zeolite is controlled by the dimensions of the channels. These are conventionally defined by the ring size of the aperture, where, for example, the term [...] "8-ring" [...] refers to a closed loop that is built from eight tetrahedrally coordinated silicon (or aluminium) atoms and 8 oxygen atoms. These rings are not always perfectly symmetrical due to a variety of effects, including strain induced by the bonding between units that are needed to produce the overall structure, or coordination of some of the oxygen atoms of the rings to cations within the structure. Therefore, the pores in many zeolites are not cylindrical.|$|E

40|$|We reconstructed <b>pore</b> <b>structures</b> {{of three}} porous solids {{that differ from}} each other in {{morphology}} and topology of pore space. To achieve this, we used a stochastic method based on simulated annealing and X-ray computed microtomography. Simulated annealing was constrained by the following microstructural descriptors sampled along the principal and diagonal directions: the two-point probability function for the void phase and the lineal-path functions for both void and solid phases. The stochastic method also assumed the isotropic <b>pore</b> <b>structures</b> in accordance with a recent paper (Čapek et al. in Transp Porous Media 88 (1) : 87 – 106 (2011)). With the exception of the solid with the widest pores, we made tomographic volume images in high and low resolution, which enabled us to study the effect of resolution on microstructural descriptors and effective transport properties. A comparison of the two-point probability function and the lineal-path function sampled in the principal directions revealed that the <b>pore</b> <b>structures</b> derived from the tomographic volume images were slightly anisotropic, in opposition to the assumption of the stochastic method. Besides the anisotropy, other microstructural descriptors including the pore-size function and the total fraction of percolating cells indicated that the morphological and topological characteristics of the <b>pore</b> <b>structures</b> depended on the reconstruction method and its parameters. Particularly, the <b>pore</b> <b>structures</b> reproduced using the stochastic method contained wider pores than those obtained using X-ray tomography. Deviations between the <b>pore</b> <b>structures</b> derived from low- and high-resolution tomographic volume images were also observed and imputed to partial volume artefacts. Then, viscous flow of incompressible liquid, ordinary diffusion, Knudsen flow and self-diffusion of water in the reconstructed pore spaces were simulated. As counterparts, experimental data were measured by means of permeation and Wicke–Kallenbach cells and pulsed field gradient NMR. Deviations between the simulated quantities {{on the one hand and}} experimental data on the other hand were generally acceptable, which corroborated the pore-space models. As expected, the predictions based on the tomographic models of pore space were more successful than those derived from the stochastic models. The stationary effective transport properties, i. e. the effective permeability, the effective pore size and the geometric factor, were sensitive to a bias in long-range pore connectivity. Furthermore, the time-dependent effective diffusivity was found to be especially sensitive to relatively small morphological deviations between the real and reconstructed <b>pore</b> <b>structures.</b> It is concluded that the combined predictions of the effective permeability, the effective pore size, the geometric factor and time-dependent effective self-diffusivity of water are needed for the reliable evaluation of pore-space reconstruction...|$|R
