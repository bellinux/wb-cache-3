The studies found, that the introduction of technical carbon P 803 in the amount of 105 <b>parts</b> <b>by</b> weight at 100 <b>parts</b> <b>by</b> weight of rubber leads to a slight increase in the viscosity of the rubber composition, hardness and tensile strength, a slight decrease in elongation at break.

Introduction of technical carbon P 803 in the amount of 115 <b>parts</b> <b>by</b> weight at 100 <b>parts</b> <b>by</b> weight of rubber results in the increase in the viscosity of rubber mixture on 6 %, the hardness on 13 %, decline of tensile strength and elongation at break on 6 %.
