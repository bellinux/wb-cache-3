5|$|The Wii's success caught {{third-party}} developers by surprise, {{leading to}} apologies {{for the quality}} of their early games. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Ubisoft's Yves Guillemot and Alain Corre admitted that they made a mistake in rushing out their launch titles, promising to take future projects more seriously. Take-Two Interactive, which released few games for the Nintendo GameCube, changed its stance towards Nintendo by placing a higher <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> the Wii.|$|E
5|$|As both {{scientists}} discovered thallium {{independently and}} {{a large part of}} the work, especially the isolation of the metallic thallium was done by Lamy, Crookes tried to secure his <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> the work. Lamy was awarded a medal at the International Exhibition in London 1862: For the discovery of a new and abundant source of thallium and after heavy protest Crookes also received a medal: thallium, for the discovery of the new element. The controversy between both scientists continued through 1862 and 1863. Most of the discussion ended after Crookes was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1863.|$|E
5|$|As {{the siege}} continued, {{supplies}} once again {{began to run}} out for the defending army, and Parliament identified the relief of Taunton as being a <b>priority.</b> <b>On</b> 28 April, they ordered Thomas Fairfax, the Commander in Chief of the recently established New Model Army, to relieve the town. Fairfax marched with the whole of his army towards Taunton; the Royalists considered sending their own army to meet him before he could reach London, but Prince Rupert convinced them instead to focus on conquering the north of England. In response to the Royalist movement north, Fairfax split his own army in two, sending a force of between 6,000 and 7,000 on to Taunton under Colonel Ralph Weldon, while Fairfax led the rest north.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{development}} of both, {{residential and commercial}} rooftop solar as well as utility-scale photovoltaic power stations, began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas, global warming concerns, and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies. In the early 2000s, the adoption of feed-in tariffs—a policy mechanism, that gives renewables <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity—lead to {{a high level of}} investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL {{is still}} in the process of {{rebuilding}} from the events of 2006. It remains under-strength and is yet to reform its training and discipline standards. Tensions within the F-FDTL also continue to threaten the stability of the force. However, the East Timorese government places a high <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> re-establishing the F-FDTL and developing it into a force capable of defending the country. In 2015 the Australian Defence Intelligence Organisation reported that little progress has been made in implementing the Force 2020 plans.|$|E
5|$|The IJN's faulty anti-submarine {{doctrine}} {{also contributed}} to Japan's shipping losses. The Navy had placed a low <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> protecting merchant shipping from submarine attack {{before and during the}} early years of the war and convoys were not routinely assembled until 1943. The Grand Escort Headquarters was formed in late 1943 to coordinate convoys and implement a standard doctrine. The Escort-of-Convoy headquarters was also established in April 1944 to provide a pool of senior commanders who were available to command convoys, though none had any experience with convoy operations or anti-submarine warfare.|$|E

5|$|The Second Avenue Subway was {{supposed}} to be the flagship project of the Program for Action. In a 1964 report, it was given top <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> a list of projects to be completed. Prior attempts to build the line had failed, and the city wished to have a Second Avenue subway line to alleviate overcrowding on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. Twenty-two blocks of tunnel were ultimately constructed, excluding seven blocks in the East Village that were prepared for tunneling operations, but never excavated.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole of}} the Pendennis site {{was placed in the}} {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Works and opened to visitors; the Ministry focused its attention on the 16th-century castle and many of the more modern buildings were destroyed. The barracks were used as a youth hostel between 1963 and 2000. The heritage agency English Heritage took over control of the castle in 1984, and placed a greater <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> the conservation of its more modern features. Extensive work was carried out across the castle in the 1990s to refurbish the fortifications and open new facilities for visitors, accompanied by archaeological surveys and excavations; in the 2000s, the sergeant's mess and the custodian's house were converted into holiday cottages.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offensive}} line was particularly concerned with containing Florida State sophomore defensive end Brandon Jenkins, who was {{tied for third}} {{in the nation in}} sacks (12) and 15th in tackles for loss (18.5). On {{the other half of the}} defensive line, defensive end Markus White recorded seven sacks during the regular season. In total, Florida State's defense was No.1 in college football in terms of sacks (43) and 15th in tackles for loss (7.2 per game). Florida State placed a <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> containing Tyrod Taylor and preventing him from scrambling for extra yardage. The Seminoles were 39th nationally in total defense, allowing an average of 341 yards per game.|$|E

40|$|Introducing <b>priorities</b> <b>on</b> {{rules in}} {{rewriting}} increases their expressive power {{and helps to}} limit computations. Priority rewriting is used in rule-based programming {{as well as in}} functional programming. Termination of priority rewriting is then important to guarantee that programs give a result. We describe in this paper an inductive proof method for termination of <b>priority</b> rewriting, relying <b>on</b> an explicit in-duction on the termination property. It works by generating proof trees, modeling the rewriting relation by using abstrac-tion and narrowing. As it specifically handles <b>priorities</b> <b>on</b> the rules, our technique allows proving termination of term rewrite systems that would diverge without priorities.

5|$|Charles's {{cautious}} {{failure to}} directly assault the town, putting a higher <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> minimising losses than on victory, had cost the Royalists dearly; while claims for their {{number of dead}} and wounded men ranged from 1,000 to 1,500, only around 50 people inside the city were killed. Essex's force, on the other hand, was in relatively good shape; its one issue {{was the lack of}} supplies. If he stayed in the Severn Valley, Essex would be unable to get reinforcements or outside aid, the London elements of the army would demand to go home, and the one remaining significant Parliamentarian force would find itself pinned down, while Charles, with secure bases at Oxford and Bristol, would be able to starve them into surrender while other Royalist armies ran rampant through Britain. Because of this, Essex {{had no choice but to}} try to return to London. Travelling back across the Cotswolds, as he had done to reach Gloucester initially, would expose the Parliamentarians to Charles's cavalry on open ground.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the Pondicherry shark {{was caught}} {{and used for}} meat. Fewer than 20 {{specimens}} have been deposited in museum collections, {{most of which were}} collected prior to 1900. This shark's rarity originally led to fears that it may be possibly extinct. However, in 2016, the Pondicherry shark was rediscovered in the Sri Lankan Menik and Kumbukkam rivers. Two photographs of this species exist; one taken from above by a group of nature enthusiasists, as well as one taken from the side by a freshwater fish survey. Given that artisanal and commercial fishing activity across its range is heavy, unregulated, and intensifying, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the Pondicherry shark as Critically Endangered and placed a high <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> locating any surviving populations.|$|E

After the promotion, Liz tries to re-assure Jenna by telling her that nobody on the show likes Tracy and that the only reason that he is on the show is because of Jack. Liz finds out that Jenna's microphone was still on, and everyone in the studio heard her say terrible things about Jack and Tracy.|$|E

5|$|On 28 July 1943, {{strike and}} bomber {{production}} {{was to be}} scaled down, and fighter and bomber destroyer production given <b>priority.</b> <b>On</b> 3 August 1943, Milch contradicted this and declared that this increase in fighter production would not affect production of the Ju 87, Ju 188, Ju 288 and Ju 290. This was an important consideration as the life expectancy of a Ju 87 had been reduced (since 1941) from 9.5 months to 5.5 months to just 100 operational flying hours. On 26 October, General der Schlachtflieger Ernst Kupfer reported the Ju 87 could no longer survive in operations and that the Focke-Wulf Fw 190F should take its place. Milch finally agreed and ordered the minimal continuance of Ju 87 D-3 and D-5 production for a smooth transition period.|$|E
5|$|Real {{schoolchildren}} participated {{throughout the}} movie's filming. Khan credited {{them with the}} film's success, and was reportedly very popular with them. Furthermore, Khan placed a high <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> the day-to-day needs of his child actors, and {{went to great lengths}} to attend to them. The production staff made sure that the students were never idle, and always kept them occupied outside of filming. New Era Faculty Coordinator Douglas Lee thought the experience not only helped the children to learn patience and cooperation, but also gave them a better understanding of how they should behave towards children like Ishaan who have problems in school. Because filming at New Era High School occurred during the winter holiday, those portraying Ishaan's classmates gave up their vacation to participate. To fill out the campus background, students from nearby schools were also brought in. A total of 1,500children were used for wide-shots of the film's art-fair climax; medium shots only required 400students.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of Merseyside County Council (MCC) in 1974 brought new {{hope that the}} Albert Dock could be redeveloped, with the MCC placing a high <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> its development. They soon entered negotiations with the MDHC and in 1979 eventually negotiated a deal {{to take over the}} running of the south docks. Despite this seeming step forward political wrangling between the MDHC (the dock owners), Liverpool City Council (the local planning authority) and Merseyside County Council (the group now responsible for redeveloping the docks) continued to hinder any development plans. Fed up with the in fighting the newly elected Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher decided that the city was incapable of handling regeneration initiatives itself and under the guidance of the 'Minister for Merseyside' Michael Heseltine, set up the Merseyside Development Corporation in 1981 to take over the responsibility of regenerating and redeveloping Liverpool's south docks.|$|E

5|$|The use of Korketrekkeren for tobogganing {{created a}} {{conflict}} with the local residents—especially at the guest house in Sverdrupstuen, which was often blocked on Sundays. There was also a conflict between cross-country skiing and tobogganing, as both groups wanted <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> the road. Akeforeningen proposed holding a tournament in 1921, but this {{was rejected by the}} municipal council. However, an auto race was held on the track that year. Permission for the sleighing race was given the following season, resulting in regular tournaments. Construction of Heftyebakken took place in 1930. The track was constructed between Frogerseteren to Svendstuen, including a concrete curve which allowed it to connect to Korketrekkeren. Heftyebakken had a poor profile as it was not steep enough in the lower areas. In 1950, Heftyebakken was converted to a skiing trail and Korketrekkeren became a pure tobogganing trail.|$|E
5|$|While the King was in California on January 31, the Straits Times of Singapore {{published}} {{a story that}} Kalākaua already had a representative in Germany finalizing {{the sale of the}} Kingdom of Hawaii. In April, Secretary of State James G. Blaine was made aware of various rumors that Kalākaua wanted to sell the kingdom to a nation other than the United States, and repeated them to Garfield, who in turn shared them in a letter to one of his friends. In an attempt to protect the interests of the United States, Blaine made it clear to British diplomat Edward Thornton that <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> annexation belonged to the United States. Thornton filed a report with his government, sending a copy to Honolulu's British consul Wodehouse who shared it with Queen Dowager Emma, Princess Likelike, her husband Archibald Scott Cleghorn, Liliuokalani, and her husband John Owen Dominis. Although troubled by the rumors and by Blaine's stance on annexation, none of them had any knowledge of the situation and so forwarded the report to Kalākaua.|$|E
5|$|As Tirpitz {{was still}} {{considered}} {{a major threat}} to Allied shipping, the British military sought to damage or destroy the battleship before she could re-enter service. Another midget submarine attack was considered impractical due to improvements to Kaafjord's defences, and the commander of the RAF's Bomber Command refused to attempt heavy bomber raids against the battleship as he believed that such operations were unlikely to be successful and would result in heavy casualties. As a result, the Home Fleet's aircraft carriers were considered the best means of attacking Kaafjord, and the Admiralty directed the fleet to begin planning such a raid in late 1943. Following several months of preparations the Home Fleet's first attack on Kaafjord, which was designated Operation Tungsten, was conducted on 3 April 1944 and involved five aircraft carriers. The two strike forces of 20 Fairey Barracuda dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters were not detected during their flights to Kaafjord, and the battleship was hit by 15 bombs. Tirpitzs crew suffered heavy casualties, but the ship was not badly damaged. Nevertheless, the damage inflicted on Tirpitzs superstructure, armament and engines was sufficient to put her out of service for several months while repairs were completed. The commander of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, placed a <b>priority</b> <b>on</b> returning the battleship to service so that she could continue to tie down Allied naval resources. He and other senior German officers recognised at this time that the threat of further air attacks meant that Tirpitz could no longer operate against Allied convoys.|$|E
