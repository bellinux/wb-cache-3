40|$|A {{numerical}} calculation procedure {{based on the}} least-squares finite element method (LSFEM) is employed to study the fluid flow and heat transfer in a 3 -D heat exchangers with in-lined and staggered multiple-row (4 rows) tubes. In this study, the fin <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> the heat exchanger is 8 fins per inch and the fluid flow is assumed steady, incompressible, and laminar with Reynolds number ranging from 200 to 600. In this paper the pressure drop, pressure coefficient, heat transfer coefficient, local Nusselt number and average Nusselt number for different geometric arrangements have been examined in detail. The numerical results demonstrate that the average heat transfer coefficient <b>of</b> <b>staggered</b> arrangement is 10 %- 30 % {{higher than that of}} the in-line one; also, it is effected more at low Reynolds number than at the high Reynolds number. The distribution of pressure drop <b>of</b> <b>staggered</b> array is higher than that of in-lined array. The variation of pressure coefficient at tube surface is dramatically for both the staggered and in-line arrangements for the angle less than 90 degree. The local Nusselt number <b>of</b> <b>staggered</b> array is higher 30 %- 80 % than that of in-lined array for the tube row 2 to 4. Overall, the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental measurement...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this article is to explain why the {{extension}} of the previously published C=(S/Ho) sqrt(J) scaling for opposed rows <b>of</b> <b>staggered</b> jets wasn’t directly successful in the study by Choi et al. (2016). It is not surprising that staggered jets from opposite sides do not pass each other at the expected C value, because Ho/D and sqrt(J) are much larger than the maximum in previous studies. These, and large x/D’s, tend to suggest development of 2 -dimensional flow. Although there are distinct optima for opposed rows of in-line jets, single-side injection, and opposed rows <b>of</b> <b>staggered</b> jets based on C, opposed rows <b>of</b> <b>staggered</b> jets provide as good or better mixing performance, at any C value, than opposed rows of in-line jets or jets from single-side injection...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a model that}} can account for the almost uniform <b>staggering</b> <b>of</b> wage contracts in some countries {{as well as for}} the markedly nonuniform staggering in others. In the model, short and long contracts as well as long contracts concluded in different periods are strategic substitutes, which provide a powerful rationale for staggering. We show that for realistic parameter values, there is a continuum of possible equilibria with various degrees <b>of</b> <b>staggering</b> <b>of</b> long contracts. If the contracting cost is not too large, then the lowest possible degree <b>of</b> <b>staggering</b> decreases with the contracting cost and increases with monetary uncertainty.

40|$|Vessel {{motion is}} {{an aspect of}} design that {{requires}} {{a high degree of}} consideration with regard to passenger comfort. Within the last two decades, extensive research work has resulted in development of numerical and analytical methods for the prediction <b>of</b> heave and <b>pitch</b> motions <b>of</b> catamaran hull forms. However, in the recent past, {{there appears to be a}} strong interest in the development of trimaran hull forms. Investigations have shown that little research has been conducted on such hull forms to reduce their motions in heave and pitch. In this paper, we will investigate the effect <b>of</b> the (longitudinal) <b>stagger</b> <b>of</b> the sidehulls on the motions in heave and <b>pitch</b> <b>of</b> a representative trimaran hull. In order to quantify the effects <b>of</b> longitudinal <b>stagger</b> <b>of</b> the sidehulls (outriggers) with respect to the centrehull, experimental investigations were undertaken at the Australian Maritime College Ship Hydrodynamic Centre (AMCSHC). A round-bilge high-speed hull form model of the AMECRC systematic series was constructed and subjected to extensive experimental analysis as well as computer simulations (HYDROS) for four different longitudinal stagger positions. The investigations demonstrated that this variation and the resulting variation in the radius of gyration could have a significant effect on the heave and pitch motions. The literature survey indicated that, to date, investigations on trimaran hull forms have been confined to determining the effect of transverse and longitudinal positions of the sidehulls only on the resistance characteristics. The investigations undertaken within the scope of this paper provide a starting point to investigate the effect of the trimaran’s sidehull position on the motions of the vessel...|$|R
