5|$|German {{forces in}} the area had been further split up, as German general Erich von Manstein was given command of the newly created Army Group Don, {{comprising}} the German Fourth Panzer and Sixth Armies, and the Third and Fourth Romanian Armies.

5|$|Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agents Dave Norton and Steve Haines contact Michael {{and demand}} that he perform a series of {{operations}} to undermine a rival agency, the International Affairs Agency (IAA). Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack an armoured convoy carrying funds intended for the IAA and steal an experimental chemical weapon from an IAA-controlled lab. As Steve comes under increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase any evidence being used against him from the FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his own activities, destroying Steve's leverage over him. Michael, Trevor, Franklin, and Lester start <b>planning</b> <b>their</b> most daring feat ever: raiding the Union Depository's gold bullion reserve.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of the ceasefire the RIRA began to regroup, {{and by the end}} of October had elected a new leadership and were <b>planning</b> <b>their</b> future direction. In late December Irish government representative Martin Mansergh held a meeting with McKevitt in Dundalk, in an attempt to convince McKevitt to disband the RIRA. McKevitt refused, stating that members would be left defenceless to attacks by the Provisional IRA. In 1999 the RIRA began preparations for a renewed campaign, and in May three members travelled to Split in Croatia to purchase arms, which were smuggled back to Ireland. On 20 October, ten people were arrested when Garda√≠ raided a RIRA training camp near Stamullen, County Meath.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} African nations {{did not show}} up in time, for various reasons such as {{difficulties}} flying through Istanbul, and finalisation of monetary arrangements (teams must pay first, and then get reimbursed later). Former Kenyan Olympic participant and owner of the website Kenya Chess Masala said that the issue just paints Africa in bad image. On 5 September, the organisers confirmed at a press-conference that the host-nation was ready to pay for the poorer nations to travel. Bhari confirmed that the travel expenses were the main problem and wrote that 116 out of the planned 187 federations were on a travel subsidy, including his native Kenya whose players had not shown in the first rounds, though. He also explained that one of the biggest issues was the timing of the funding and that the teams were expected to pay on their own and be reimbursed upon arrival. Finally, Bhari had already reminded other federations to start <b>planning</b> <b>their</b> travel expenses for the 43rd Chess Olympiad in Batumi in 2018. In the end, 10 African nations did not arrive (Kenya, Cameroon, Mali, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Liberia, Seychelles, Senegal, Central African Republic).|$|E
5|$|Having {{completed}} work on Oblivion in 2006, Bethesda Game Studios {{began work}} on Fallout 3. It was during this time that the team began <b>planning</b> <b>their</b> next The Elder Scrolls game. From the outset, {{they had decided to}} set the new entry in the land of Skyrim, incorporating dragons into the main theme of the game. Full development begun following the release of Fallout 3 in 2008; the developers considered Skyrim a spiritual successor to both Fallout 3 and previous The Elder Scrolls games. The game was developed by a team of roughly 100 people composed of new talent {{as well as of the}} series' veterans. The production was supervised by Todd Howard, who was the director of several titles released by Bethesda Softworks.|$|E

5|$|Opposing the Allies was the German Army Group G (HeeresgruppeG). Although {{nominally}} an army group, Army GroupG had at {{the time}} of the invasion only one army under its command: the 19th Army, under the command of Friedrich Wiese. As southern France had never been important to German <b>planning,</b> <b>their</b> forces there had been stripped of nearly all their valuable units and equipment over the course of the war. Due to the Allied threat in Normandy Army Group G's units were continuously sent north until the Dragoon landings. The remaining 11 divisions were understrength and only one panzer division was left, the 11th Panzer Division. In early August the 11th Panzer Division had sent one of its two panzer battalions to Normandy shortly before the landing.|$|E
5|$|Shannen Says is an eight-episode American reality {{television}} series which was broadcast on WE tv from April 10 to May 13, 2012. It focused on {{preparations for the}} wedding of actress Shannen Doherty and photographer Kurt Iswarienko, with help from celebrity-wedding planner David Tutera. The series' premise originated from a discussion between Doherty and Iswarienko about providing a look into their lives and document the stress {{on a couple of}} <b>planning</b> <b>their</b> wedding. The series' executive producers included Doherty, Iswarienko, Kathleen Farrell, Tom Forman, and Russell Heldt. It was filmed in Malibu, California over a seven-week period, and was produced by RelativityREAL and Doherty's production company No Apologies Productions.

5|$|The Athenians and Eretrians sent a {{task force}} of 25 triremes to Asia Minor. Whilst there, the Greek army {{surprised}} and outmaneuvered Artaphernes, marching to Sardis and there burning the lower city. However, this was {{as much as the}} Greeks achieved, and they were then pursued back to the coast by Persian horsemen, losing many men in the process. Despite the fact their actions were ultimately fruitless, the Eretrians and in particular the Athenians had earned Darius's lasting enmity, and he vowed to punish both cities. The Persian naval victory at the Battle of Lade (494 BC) all but ended the Ionian Revolt, and by 493 BC, the last hold-outs were vanquished by the Persian fleet. The revolt was used as an opportunity by Darius to extend the empire's border to the islands of the East Aegean and the Propontis, which had not been part of the Persian dominions before. The completion of the pacification of Ionia allowed the Persians to begin <b>planning</b> <b>their</b> next moves; to extinguish the threat to the empire from Greece, and to punish Athens and Eretria.|$|E

5|$|The {{third season}} of The Hills begins with Whitney Port {{becoming}} Lauren's boss, after being promoted within Teen Vogue. On their first day returning to work, Lauren informs Whitney of false speculation regarding a sex tape involving {{herself and her}} ex-boyfriend Jason Wahler. Lauren comments that she has not spoken with Heidi since she moved into an apartment with Spencer, and the women become suspicious of her possible involvement with the rumors. Meanwhile, Heidi and Spencer are <b>planning</b> <b>their</b> housewarming party; Spencer plans on inviting several of his friends, while Heidi was only planning on inviting Lauren, Whitney, and Audrina Patridge. Visiting Audrina at Epic Records unannounced, she delivers invitations for Audrina and Lauren.

5|$|In 1999, Takahashi {{talked with}} Hirohide Sugiura, who had {{likewise}} worked at Square and {{was beginning to}} feel frustrated {{due to a lack of}} creative freedom. After discussing the matter, the two decided to create their own company and pursue projects they wanted to create. When <b>planning</b> <b>their</b> new company, Takahashi and Sugiura decided that they needed a publisher with substantial market presence to help them rather than being an independent studio. Takahashi and Sugiura approached multiple companies for support, but most of the companies they contacted outright rejected their offer as they believed that Monolith Soft should be an independent company. However, Namco were interested in investing into Monolith Soft as a dedicated subsidiary, whilst handling logistics and marketing so that the core staff could focus on game development. An important supporter of Monolith Soft was Namco's founder Masaya Nakamura, who shared many of Takahashi and Sugiura's goals and ideals. Monolith Soft is noted as being one of a group of video game companies‚Äîalongside Sacnoth, Love-de-Lic and Mistwalker‚Äîfounded by Square staff who had worked on notable titles produced during the 1990s. The company was officially founded on 1 October 1999 by Takahashi, Sugiura, and Yasuyuki Honne, who had worked at Square on both the Chrono series and with Takahashi on Xenogears. The company's offices were originally based in Yokohama.|$|E
