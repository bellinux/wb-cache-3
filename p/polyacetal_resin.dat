Metal zippers can be painted to match the surrounding fabric; plastic zippers {{can be made in}} any color of plastic. Plastic zippers mostly use <b>polyacetal</b> <b>resin,</b> though other thermoplastic polymers are used as well, such as polyethylene. Used most popularly for pencil cases, small plastic pouchs and other useful stationery.|$|E

Methods: LiDrapeÂ® is a cylindrical device that consists of two flexible rings of <b>polyacetal</b> <b>resin</b> with a transparent elastic silicone sheet attached to the rings. The novel device holds the eyelids between the rings, and {{a hole in the}} center of the device provides a surgical field. We used the novel device in cataract surgery (75 eyes), glaucoma surgery (eleven eyes), vitrectomy (ten eyes), and intravitreal injection (six eyes) and evaluated its clinical efficacy. Results: The LiDrape was easy to attach and detach. The novel device was not detached from the eye during surgery. No eyelashes or secretions from the meibomian glands were seen in the surgical field, and the drape provided a sufficient surgical field. Conclusions: The LiDrape functions as a lid speculum as well as a drape. Our results showed that the novel device is useful for ocular surgeries.
