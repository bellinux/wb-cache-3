40|$|Lecturepg. 107 The use of {{long shaft}} {{vertical}} pumps is {{common practice in}} the nuclear waste processing industry. Unfortunately, when such pumps employ <b>plain</b> <b>cylindrical</b> journal bearings, they tend to suffer from rotordynamic instability problems due to the inherent lightly-loaded condition that the vertical orientation places on the bearings. This paper describes {{a case study in}} which the authors utilized rotordynamic analysis and experimental vibration analysis to diagnose such a problem and designed replacement tilting-pad bearings to solve the problem. The subject pumps are 45 foot long vertical pumps used for mixing nuclear waste in one million gallon tanks. Each pumping system consists of an induction motor driven by a variable frequency drive, a segmented pump shaft with a centrifugal impeller at the bottom, and a pipe column that surrounds the pump shaft and is suspended into the tank. The column is filled with water that serves as the lubricant for the eight <b>plain</b> <b>cylindrical</b> journal bearings that support the pump shaft. Unfortunately, these pumps have been plagued with vibration related problems, such as bearing and seal failures, ever since they were commissioned. In order to evaluate the problem, the pump shaft and column were instrumented with vibration transducers, and vibration testing was performed. This testing revealed that subsynchronous whirling, at approximately one-half the running speed, was the primary culprit responsible for the failures. In an effort to understand the cause of the observed vibrations, a two-level rotordynamic model of the pump shafting and column was constructed. This rotordynamic model, like those for many vertical pumps, was far from routine. The rotordynamic analysis, which is described in detail, then successfully confirmed that the problem was subsynchronous whirling due to rotordynamic instability. This analysis was then used to guide the design of tilting-pad bearings employing offset pivots and geometric preload to replace the original <b>plain</b> <b>cylindrical</b> bearings and, thereby, resolve the instability problem. The <b>plain</b> <b>cylindrical</b> bearings were removed from a pump, tilting-pad bearings were installed, and subsequent testing verified the predicted vibration reduction. Accordingly, the application of tilting-pad bearings, whose design is described in detail, was conclusively shown to be an effective solution for this specific problem...|$|R

50|$|Legend, as {{recorded}} in the Nihon Shoki (Chronicles of Japan) which is an ancient history of Japan compiled in 720, states that thaniwa was ordered {{at the time of}} an empress's death by the emperor who regretted the custom of servants and maids of the deceased following their master in death, and ordered that clay figures be molded and placed around the kofun burial mound instead of the sacrifice of living beings.

5000|$|A spark <b>plug</b> gap <b>gauge</b> is a disc with {{a sloping}} edge, or with round wires of precise diameters, {{and is used}} to measure the gap. Use of a feeler gauge with flat blades instead of round wires, as is used on {{distributor}} points or valve lash, will give erroneous results, due to the shape of spark plug electrodes. The simplest gauges are a collection of keys of various thicknesses which match the desired gaps and the gap is adjusted until the key fits snugly. With current engine technology, universally incorporating solid state ignition systems and computerized fuel injection, the gaps used are larger on average than in the era of carburetors and breaker point distributors, to the extent that spark <b>plug</b> <b>gauges</b> from that era cannot always measure the required gaps of current cars.

30|$|Although {{classical}} OAT mosaicplasty has favorable clinical outcomes, gap {{spaces between}} the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> which end up with fibrocartilage filling remain as an issue to solve. When the coverage of a standard area with equally sized <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> is calculated it can only cover 80  % of the defect. Radulescu et al. reported in their histological study the mean HC ratio of the treated area as 70  % (Rădulescu et al. 2008). In case {{of the use of}} differently sized plugs the gap spaces area can be reduced but cannot be eliminated (Hangody et al. 2004). There are a number of studies focused on the gap spaces. Ma et al. combined OAT mosaicplasty with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell in their experimental animal study and concluded that this combination promotes integration of dead spaces between plugs (Ma et al. 2015). Chen concluded that tissue-engineered cartilage tissue can promote the integration of dead spaces between round plugs in their animal study (Chen 2014). The hexagonal design has intended to solve the gap interspace issue between the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> used in classical OAT mosaicplasty with changing the geometry of the autologous plugs. In the nature the honey bees produce their hive in combination of hexagonal cells. In 1999 Hales proved mathematically that hexagonal geometry is the way of build a construct with minimum amount of material without gaps (Hales 1999). Thus, the HOGS provides hexagonal arrangement with hexagonal prism shaped plugs which can be easily harvested and placed to the defect area with same surgical steps as in classical OAT mosaicplasty. Therefore we can presume that the learning curve of this technique would be short. Eventually, we observed in our study that application of OAT mosaicplasty with the new HOGS has no difference in surgical exposure and steps of the surgical procedure. However, the preparation step of the cartilage lesion has technically more difficult than harvesting the graft. Nevertheless, it was possible to align hexagonal prism shaped grafts without leaving interspaces in the defect area {{with the help of the}} geometrical nature of hexagons and obtain higher levels of coverage. We revealed according to these subjective observations HOGS can be an option to solve the gap space issue faced during the classical OAT mosaicplasty. But, it is obvious that future clinical or experimental studies have to prove the tissue quality of the cartilage tissue at the end of the treatment.|$|R

30|$|A focal full {{thickness}} {{cartilage lesion}} of knee joint {{is one of}} the commonly seen intraarticular pathologies among the joint cartilage problems. The clinical picture can be ranged from knee pain, locking and swelling to severe functional impairment. Moreover, large defects are more likely to cause functional impairment which is especially important in young and physically active individuals and athlete (Bentley and Minas 2000). The treatment of focal cartilage lesion in the knee joint is still a challenging issue (Richter et al. 2015). Lesions > 3  cm 2 have worse results compared to smaller defects (Solheim et al. 2013). The management techniques of full thickness cartilage lesions can be listed as osteochondral autograft transfer (OAT) mosaicplasty, mosaicplasty with synthetic plugs whole tissue transplantation, autologous chondrocyte implantation, cell based scaffold treatment, tissue engineered collagen matrices with autologous chondrocytes and bone marrow stimulation via microfracture (Bedi et al. 2010; Clavé et al. 2016). Among them OAT mosaicplasty is a method which has satisfactory outcomes (Lynch et al. 2015; Hangody et al. 2010; Oztürk et al. 2006). This method is based on the transfer of osteochondral grafts harvested from the non-weight bearing areas of knee to the lesion area. Furthermore, in classical OAT mosaicplasty the autologous osteochondral grafts are <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> of spongious bone covered with hyaline cartilage at one end. The advantages of OAT mosaicplasty are reconstruction of the articular cartilage with high percentages of hyaline cartilage, being a single stage procedure, low risk of disease transmission, and low cost. In spite of the favorable clinical results there are some pitfalls of mosaicplasty treatment especially in cases of large defects. Fibrocartilage filling of the gap spaces between <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> and insufficient donor cartilage reserves are among the disadvantages of classical OAT mosaicplasty. The new hexagonal osteochondral graft system (HOGS) investigated in this study is designed with the inspiration taken from the honey bees. This hexagonal geometry is used in several fields of technology (Kalogirou 2004; Kaushika and Sumathy 2003).|$|R
