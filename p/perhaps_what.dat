25|$|Elephants Can Remember {{was cited}} {{in a study}} done in 2009 using {{computer}} science to compare Christie's earlier works to her later ones. The sharp drops in vocabulary size and increases in repeated phrases and indefinite nouns suggested Christie may have been suffering from some form of onset dementia, <b>perhaps</b> <b>what</b> later became known as Alzheimer's disease. The subject of the book being memory may be another clue.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>what</b> Berossus omits {{to mention}} is also noteworthy. Much {{information}} on Sargon (c. 2300 BC) {{would have been}} available during his time (e.g., a birth legend preserved at El-Amarna and in an Assyrian fragment from 8th century BC, and two Neo-Babylonian fragments), but these were not mentioned. Similarly, the great Babylonian king Hammurabi (ca. 1750 BC) merits only passing mention. He did, however, mention that the queen Semiramis (probably Sammuramat, wife of Samshi-Adad V, 824811 BC) was Assyrian. Perhaps it {{was in response to}} Greek writers mythologising her to the point where she was described as the founder of Babylon, daughter of the Syrian goddess Derketo, and married to Ninus (the legendary founder of Nineveh, according to Greek authors).|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{inspiration}} behind the remix, Hayden Thorpe from Wild Beasts group told The Guardian: [...] "The unlikeness of this match was <b>perhaps</b> <b>what</b> compelled {{us to take}} it on. Gaga in many ways {{is the epitome of}} what we are not. She is the butcher to our butter knife. The essential thrill is always to keep eluding what is expected of us and what we expect of ourselves." [...] The last of the remix to be released was The Weeknd's take on [...] "Marry the Night" [...] which featured Illangelo, thus earning him a co-producer credit on it.|$|E

500|$|The Brythonic {{successor}} {{states of}} what is now the modern Anglo-Scottish border region are referred to by Welsh scholars as part of Yr Hen Ogledd ("The Old North"). This included the kingdoms of Bryneich, which may have had its capital at modern Bamburgh in Northumberland, and Gododdin, centred on Din Eidyn (<b>perhaps</b> <b>what</b> is now Edinburgh) and stretching across modern Lothian. Some [...] "Angles" [...] may have been employed as mercenaries along Hadrian's Wall during the late Roman period. Others are thought to have migrated north (by sea) from Deira ( [...] or Dere) in the early 6th century. At some point the Angles took control of Bryneich, which became the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Bernicia (...) [...] The first Anglo-Saxon king in the historical record is Ida, who is said to have obtained the throne around 547. Around 600, the Gododdin raised a force of about 300 men to assault the Anglo-Saxon stronghold of Catraeth, perhaps Catterick, North Yorkshire. The battle, which ended disastrously for the Britons, was memorialised in the poem Y Gododdin.|$|E

While Cobb preached ascetic self-denial, Ruth gorged on hot dogs, beer and women. [...] <b>Perhaps</b> <b>what</b> angered him the most about Ruth was that despite Babe's total disregard for his physical condition and traditional baseball, he was still an overwhelming success and brought fans to the ballparks in record numbers to see him challenge his own slugging records.|$|E
2500|$|As {{leader of}} the West Side Crips, Williams became the {{archetype}} of {{the new wave of}} Los Angeles gang members. As others originated, a Crip leader in Brentwood California, named [...] "Armando" [...] had been leading the Crips. With Williams and his best friend, [...] "enforcer" [...] Curtis [...] "Buddha" [...] Morrow, they would engage in random acts of violence against rival gang members and innocent people alike, striking fear in both street criminals and the residents of South Central, Watts, Inglewood and Compton. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>what</b> made his exploits even more legendary was the fact that on numerous occasions the criminal charges ended in disarray. Prosecutors were unable to charge him due to lack of evidence.|$|E

2500|$|Berlioz's {{style is}} one of the most {{idiosyncratic}} of the 19th century. The characteristics of his music do not always take immediate effect and a familiarity is regarded as essential to its understanding. Berlioz's claim to be an inspired and natural melodist is irrefutable. Few of his melodies fall into regular phrase lengths, and when they do, they sound uncharacteristic. But <b>perhaps</b> <b>what</b> is [...] "characteristic" [...] of Berlioz's style is the way in which it cannot necessarily be tamped down. For example, Berlioz found the regular balance of four- and eight-bar phrases uncongenial. Sometimes his melodies expand to great length, or fill an entire movement in one long arch. Much of his melodic strength is built on small chromatic inflections.|$|E
2500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{called it}} [...] "generally upbeat and positive", commending {{her return to}} making [...] "fun and cheery pop music." [...] The Tech stated, [...] "All for You as a whole makes for fun listening. Bouncing from orgiastic sex music to bubble gum pop music to soulful ballads, the album {{contains}} a true range of music... At any rate, bubble gum pop, easy as it comes, gets a twist with Janet, elegantly escorted with acoustic guitars and the whole gamut of computerized yet natural-sounding instrumentals. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>what</b> sells the album, more than the songs, is Janet’s voice and her innovative (and frankly, courageous) use of beats and harmonies. Janet’s voice is as pristine as ever, and, never outshined... she overpowers every track." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{noteworthy}} {{difference between}} Thucydides's method of writing history {{and that of}} modern historians is Thucydides's inclusion of lengthy formal speeches that, as he himself states, were literary reconstructions rather than actual quotations of what was said—or, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>what</b> he believed {{ought to have been}} said. Arguably, had he not done this, the gist of what was said would not otherwise be known at all—whereas today there is a plethora of documentation—written records, archives and recording technology for historians to consult. Therefore, Thucydides's method served to rescue his mostly oral sources from oblivion. We do not know how these historical figures actually spoke. Thucydides's recreation uses a heroic stylistic register. A celebrated example is Pericles' funeral oration, which heaps honour on the dead and includes a defence of democracy: ...|$|E

2500|$|Ibn al-Salah said, [...] "A hadith, {{according}} to its specialists, is divided into ṣaḥīḥ ("authentic"), ḥasan and ḍaʻīf." [...] While the individual terms of hadith terminology are many, many more than these three terms, the final outcome is essentially determining whether a particular hadith is ṣaḥīḥ and, therefore, actionable, or ḍaʻīf and not actionable. This is evidenced by al-Bulqini's commentary on Ibn al-Salah's statement. Al-Bulqini commented that [...] "the terminology of the hadith specialists is more than this, while, at the same time, is only ṣaḥīḥ and its opposite. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>what</b> has been intended by the latter categorization (i.e. into two categories) relates to standards of religious authority, or lack of it, in general, and what will be mentioned afterwards (i.e. the sixty-five categories) is a specification of that generality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dozier's {{interest}} rekindled Selznick's, which up to {{that point}} had only been tepid. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>what</b> started Hitchcock's mind rolling was [...] "The Song of the Dragon", a short story by John Taintor Foote which had appeared as a two-part serial in the Saturday Evening Post in November 1921; Selznick, who owned the rights to it, had passed it on to Hitchcock from his unproduced story file during the filming of Spellbound. Set during World War I in New York, [...] "The Song of the Dragon" [...] told the tale of a theatrical producer approached by federal agents, who want his assistance in recruiting an actress he once had a relationship with to seduce the leader of a gang of enemy saboteurs. Although the story was a nominal starting point that [...] "offered some inspiration, the final narrative was pure Hitchcock." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 951, while Amlaíb was in Britain {{his brother}} Gofraid died in Dublin of disease. Congalach's rival Ruaidrí was also dead, leaving Amlaíb's former ally as undisputed High King {{and thus a}} serious threat to Dublin and the {{south-eastern}} Irish kingdom of Leinster. This threat was <b>perhaps</b> <b>what</b> led to Congalach's death in an ambush at Dún Ailinne (modern County Kildare) or at Tech Guigenn in the region of the River Liffey [...] while collecting tribute in Leinster in 956. The main beneficiary was the brother of Amlaíb's new wife Dúnflaith, Domnall ua Néill, who became the next High King of Ireland. The marriage linked Amlaíb not only to the northern Uí Néill kindred of Cenél nEógain, but also to the southern Clann Cholmáin as he was now stepfather to Dúnflaith's young son Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill.|$|E

2500|$|Lauren Everitt from BBC News Magazine {{commented on}} melisma used in Houston's {{recording}} and its influence. [...] "An early 'I' in Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' takes nearly six seconds to sing. In those seconds the former gospel singer-turned-pop star packs {{a series of}} different notes into the single syllable", stated Everitt. [...] "The technique is repeated throughout the song, most pronouncedly on every 'I' and 'you'. The vocal technique is called melisma, and it has inspired a host of imitators. Other artists may have used it before Houston, {{but it was her}} rendition of Dolly Parton's love song that pushed the technique into the mainstream in the 90s. [...] But <b>perhaps</b> <b>what</b> Houston nailed best was moderation." [...] Everitt said that [...] "n a climate of reality shows ripe with 'oversinging,' it's easy to appreciate Houston's ability to save melisma for just the right moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1951, Bernstein {{conducted}} the New York Philharmonic {{in the world}} première of the Symphony No. 2 of Charles Ives, which was written around half a century earlier but had never been performed. Throughout his career, Bernstein often talked about the music of Ives, who died in 1954. The composer, old and frail, was unable (some reports say unwilling) to attend the concert, but his wife did. He reportedly listened to a radio broadcast of it on a radio in his kitchen some days later. A recording of the [...] "premiere" [...] was released in a 10-CD box set Bernstein LIVE by the orchestra, but the notes indicate it was a repeat performance from three days later, and this is <b>perhaps</b> <b>what</b> Ives heard. In any case, reports also differ on Ives's exact reaction, but some suggest he was thrilled and danced a little jig. Bernstein recorded the 2nd symphony with the orchestra in 1958 for Columbia and 1987 for Deutsche Grammophon. There is also a 1987 performance with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra available on DVD.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his other interests, Laird founded the Xeric Foundation, a nonprofit organization created after considerable thought, as [...] "an appropriate way to give back something extra to the comics world," [...] by providing grants for self-publishers. While Eastman founded Tundra Publishing to embody {{the ideals of the}} Creator's Bill of Rights from a publishers standpoint, Laird's vision involved funding rather than actively publishing individuals' work. His reasoning for this decision was in part simply due to him having [...] "far too much to do as it is with Mirage." [...] He [...] "preferred to do something where {{it was more of a}} transfer of capital," [...] with [...] "all the worries... on other people's shoulders." [...] The foundation itself, he explains is: [...] "actually two foundations in one. One half of it is for charitable organizations, and the other half is for creators who want to self-publish their comics." [...] That later half is <b>perhaps</b> <b>what</b> the foundation is best known for, working much the same as any benevolent fund, involving an applicatory process detailing how much money is being applied for and why.|$|E
