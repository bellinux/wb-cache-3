5|$|Su Song {{also created}} a {{celestial}} atlas (in five separate maps), which had the hour circles between the xiu (lunar mansions) forming the astronomical meridians, with stars marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection {{on each side of}} the equator, and thus, was in accordance to their north <b>polar</b> <b>distances.</b> Furthermore, Su Song must have taken advantage of the astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer Shen Kuo. This is so because Su Song's fourth star map places the position of the pole star halfway between Tian shu (−350 degrees) and the current Polaris; this was the more accurate calculation (by 3 degrees) that Shen Kuo had made when he observed the pole star over a period of three months with his width-improved sighting tube. There were many star maps written before Song's book, but the greatest significance of these star maps by Su Song is, that they represent the oldest extant star maps in printed form.|$|R

50|$|Whether a star is {{circumpolar}} {{depends upon}} the observer's latitude. Since the altitude of the north or south celestial pole (whichever is visible) equals the absolute value of the observer's latitude, any star whose angular distance from the visible celestial pole {{is less than the}} absolute latitude will be circumpolar. For example, if the observer's latitude is 50° N, any star will be circumpolar if it is less than 50° from the north celestial pole. If the observer's latitude is 35° S, then all stars within 35° of the south celestial pole are circumpolar.

Beginning in October 1783, the Herschels used a 20-foot reflecting telescope to search for nebulae. Initially, William attempted to both observe and record objects, but this was inefficient and he required an assistant to keep records. Naturally, he turned to Caroline. She would sit by a window inside, William would shout his observations, and Caroline would record. This was not a simple clerical task, however, because {{she would have to}} use John Flamsteed's catalogue to identify the star William used as a reference point for the nebulae. Because Flamsteed's catalogue was organized by constellation, it was less useful to the Herschels, so Caroline created her own catalogue organized by north <b>polar</b> <b>distance.</b> The following morning, Caroline would go over her notes and write up formal observations, which she called [...] "minding the heavens." ...|$|E

Therefore, the cyclic change cannot be effectively represented in CCSs. This paper thus proposes the use of Polar Coordinate Systems (PCSs) to represent the phenomena with cyclic changes.

40|$|The {{core region}} around the crack tip {{is defined as}} the region which is {{strongly}} influenced by the rapid and nonlinear variation of the mechanical and optical properties of the substance. Then this region is not convenient for measurements yielding SIFs. In this paper an extensive experimental study was undertaken to define the limits of the core region at a typical crack tip in order to bound the zone of the accurate evaluation of the SIF. Moreover, for large <b>polar</b> <b>distances</b> from the crack tip the singular elastic solution is becoming progressively erroneous, and therefore it yields progressive deviations from the accurate values of K and increasing errors. The method, which was used to determine the zone for the correct evaluation of SIFs, was the method of reflected caustics. The radii of their initial curves, defining the caustics, were changing from lower to higher values as the polar distance,r, from the tip was increasing, and this could be achieved either by varying the external load of the plate and/or the optical and mechanical parameters of the experimental arrangement and the specimen. The respective SIFs evaluated from the reflected caustics were then changed from lower values to constant ones, and then, for larger values of r, they deviated again progressively to higher values. It is evident that the zone of constant Kdefines the limits of validity of the elastic theory based on the singular term of the stress function. Therefore, the constancy of K yields the criterion for the correct size of the core region. By applying the singular-term elastic solution for the evaluation of caustics and the criterion of constancy of the K the whole region of validity of the method was for the first time defined. Experimental evidence and comparison with theoretical results proved the validity of the method. © 1986...|$|R
