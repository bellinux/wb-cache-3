5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped <b>peccary</b> (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the diet of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, river clam and river turtle. Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, {{such as those of}} the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and the crocodile (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.|$|E
5|$|Stelae were {{considered}} to be invested with holiness and, perhaps, even to contain a divine soul-like essence that almost made them living beings. Some were apparently given individual names in hieroglyphic texts and {{were considered}} to be participants in rituals conducted at their location. Such rituals in the Classic Period appear to have included a k'altun binding ritual, in which the stela was wrapped in bands of tied cloth. This ritual was closely tied to the k'atun-ending calendrical ceremony. A k'altun ritual is depicted carved onto a <b>peccary</b> skull deposited as a funerary offering at Copán, the scene shows two nobles flanking a stela-altar pair where the stela seems to have been bound with cloth. The act of wrapping or binding a sacred object was of considerable religious importance across Mesoamerica, and is well attested among the Maya right up to the present day. The precise meaning of the act is not clear, but may be to protect the bound object or to contain its sacred essence. The binding of stelae may be linked to the modern K'iche' Maya practice of wrapping small divinatory stones in a bundle.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{microsatellite}} {{technique was}} used to evaluate the genetic variability in populations of collared and white-lipped <b>peccaries</b> kept in captivity. Six primers developed for domestic pigs were used and amplified in both species. They revealed the presence of five polymorphic loci and one monomorphic locus. The polymorphic loci included 4 of the 16 alleles in collared <b>peccaries,</b> and 3 of the 10 alleles in the white-lipped <b>peccaries.</b> Polymorphic information content (PIC) in both species and all the loci was highly informative. The probability of paternity exclusion (PEC), if one of the parents is known, was almost as high in white-lipped <b>peccaries</b> (95. 53 %) as in the collared (99, 48 %). The Fst values for collared (0. 042) and white-lipped (0. 1387) <b>peccaries</b> showed that both populations are not structured.

40|$|Palms (Arecaceae) are a {{dominant}} element within the neotropical plant community {{and because they}} substantially contribute to the overall and year-round fruit availability they are considered a key resource for frugivores, particularly for <b>peccaries.</b> Similarly, <b>peccaries</b> (Tayassuidae) are {{a dominant}} element within the neotropical mammal community. Their evolution of a strong mastication apparatus, unique interlocking canines, patterns of movement, and foraging ecology are viewed as adaptations to exploit hard seeds, particulary palm seeds. But how strong are the interactions between <b>peccaries</b> and palms, {{and what are the}} ecological ramifications? This review synthesizes over 76 papers, published between 1917 and 2004, which revealed that <b>peccaries</b> consumed fruits from 46 palm species, 73 % of whose seeds were destroyed after ingestion. Furthermore, <b>peccaries</b> disperse palm seeds; eat flowers, seedlings, and roots; and trample seedlings. Thus, <b>peccaries</b> affect the spatiotemporal distribution and demography of palms. Local extinction of <b>peccaries</b> resulted in dramatic changes in the forest ecology. New conservation strategies are required to protect <b>peccaries</b> and prevent negative cas-cading effects.

5|$|An apex predator, Smilodon {{primarily}} hunted large mammals. Isotopes {{preserved in}} the bones of S.fatalis in the La Brea Tar Pits reveal that ruminants like bison (Bison antiquus, which was {{much larger than the}} modern American bison) and camels (Camelops) were most commonly taken by the cats there. In addition, isotopes {{preserved in the}} tooth enamel of S.gracilis specimens from Florida show that this species fed on the <b>peccary</b> Platygonus and the llama-like Hemiauchenia. In rare cases, Smilodon may have also targeted glyptodonts, based on a Glyptotherium skull that bears elliptical puncture marks consistent with the size and diameter of its canine teeth. This was a juvenile glyptodont with an incompletely developed cephalic shield (head armor). Isotopic studies of dire wolf (Canis dirus) and American lion (Panthera leo atrox) bones show an overlap with S.fatalis in prey, which suggests that they were competitors. The availability of prey in the Rancho La Brea area was likely comparable to modern East Africa. As Smilodon migrated to South America, its diet changed; bison were absent, the horses and proboscideans were different, and native ungulates such as toxodonts and litopterns were completely unfamiliar, yet S.populator thrived as well there as its relatives in North America. The differences between the North and South American species {{may be due to the}} difference in prey between the two continents. Smilodon probably avoided eating bone and would have left enough food for scavengers. Smilodon itself may have scavenged dire wolf kills. It has been suggested that Smilodon was a scavenger that mainly used its canines for display to assert dominance over carcasses, but this theory is not supported today as no modern terrestrial mammals are pure scavengers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Peccaries</b> and pigs, Tayassuidae and Suidae respectively, diverged {{approximately}} one {{million years ago}} from a common ancestor. Because these families share some pathogens, <b>peccaries</b> can act as reservoirs of infectious pathogens for domestic and wild swine. We evaluated the presence of swine infectious agents in the spleen and lung tissues of white-lipped <b>peccaries</b> (WLP; Tayassu pecari) and collared <b>peccaries</b> (CP; Pecari tajacu) in Brazil. Samples from 10 adult CP and three WLP, which had been hunted by locals or hit by motor vehicles, were obtained from two free-ranging Brazilian populations. The samples were tested by PCR for Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, porcine circovirus 2 (PCV 2), Suid herpesvirus 1 (SuHV- 1), and porcine parvovirus (PPV). Positive samples were sequenced. Both species were negative for PPV and B. bronchiseptica and positive for PCV 2 and SuHV- 1. The lungs of two animals were positive for M. hyopneumoniae and P. multocida. This report is the first demonstration of PCV 2 and SuHV- 1 swine viruses and of M. hyopneumoniae and P. multocida bacteria in <b>peccaries.</b> One factor contributing to this detection was access to tissue samples, which is uncommon. The role of these infectious agents in <b>peccaries</b> is unknown and further epidemiologic studies should be performed.
