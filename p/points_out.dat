Second, I <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the opposition of endophoric reference vs. exophoric reference in anaphoric constructions...|$|R

5|$|A Palestinian {{suicide bomber}} in Jerusalem causes {{the death of}} several Israelis, {{as well as two}} American nationals.

As Leo <b>points</b> <b>out,</b> however, the solution is likely to be only temporary.|$|E

50|$|After a spymaster {{gives the}} hint with its word and number, their field {{operatives}} make guesses about which code name cards bear words {{related to the}} hint and <b>point</b> them <b>out,</b> one at a time. When a code name card is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the spymaster covers that card with an appropriate identity card -- a blue agent card, a red agent card, an innocent bystander card, or the assassin card -- as indicated on the spymasters' map of the grid. If the assassin is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the game ends immediately, with the team who identified him losing. If {{an agent of the}} other team is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the turn ends immediately, and that other team is also one agent closer to winning. If an innocent bystander is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the turn simply ends; but note that this also eliminates one more potential wrong guess that the other team might have made, right before their turn. If an agent of the playing team is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the team may <b>point</b> <b>out</b> another card if they have guesses left. Again, the maximum number of guesses in any turn is the hint's number plus one.|$|R

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} <b>points</b> <b>out,</b> {{that during}} the Bronze Age the region was inhabited by populations that probably spoke a northwestern Greek dialect.

The earliest recorded inhabitants of the area around Gjirokastër were the Greek-speaking tribe of the Chaonians, that belonged to the Epirote group.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} human qualities, we never entirely lose sympathy with Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, and our {{imagination}} participates with theirs in the tragedy. Their imagination makes the two more human and yet also destroys them. As Kinnaird <b>points</b> <b>out</b> (elaborating on {{an idea of}} Joseph W. Donohue, Jr.), Hazlitt in part sees Macbeth as a tragedy of imagination itself.|$|E

5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required {{the permission of}} the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that the word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E
5|$|Busch biographer Joseph Kraus divided {{his work}} into three periods. He <b>points</b> <b>out,</b> however, that this {{classification}} is a simplification, as some works by their nature {{can be of}} a later or earlier period.

5|$|Film critic Ben Zipper {{believes}} that Kiarostami’s {{work as a}} landscape artist {{is evident in the}} composition of distant shots of the dry hills throughout a number of his films. He <b>points</b> <b>out</b> that Kiarostami’s use of rural locations and remote settings is reminiscent of Sohrab Sepehri’s attention to landscape as represented in his poems such as Golestaneh, in which the poet treats the rural environment realistically and imbues it with a poetic aura.|$|E
