40|$|A single {{frequency}} resonance mode is applied by a transducer to acoustically levitate an object within a chamber. This process allows smooth {{movement of the}} object and suppression of unwanted levitation modes that would urge the object to a different levitation position. A <b>plunger</b> <b>forms</b> {{one end of the}} chamber, and the frequency changes as the plunger moves. Acoustic energy is applied to opposite sides of the chamber, with the acoustic energy on opposite sides being substantially 180 degrees out of phase...|$|E
40|$|A pulsed {{solenoid valve}} which can operate up to 550 [*]°C has been {{designed}} for supersonic jet introduction. This valve uses a novel design where the nozzle head, which serves as the hot oven, and the solenoid operator are separated and the latter is maintained at a relatively low temperature using water cooling. A long steel <b>plunger</b> <b>forms</b> a metal‐to‐metal seal at the orifice which is broken when the magnetic field generated by the solenoid pulls back the plunger. Thus, although the oven operates at the high temperatures required for nonvolatile materials, the solenoid operator and electrical parts remain relatively cool...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Thin-walled {{tubes are}} {{generally}} used as {{impact energy absorber}} in various application due to their ease of fabrication and installation, high energy absorption capacity and long stroke. However, {{the main drawback of}} plain tube is the high initial peak force. A concentric <b>plunger</b> in the <b>form</b> of tapered block is proposed to overcome this shortcoming while at the same time, improving the impact performance. Static and dynamic axial crushing were performed to determine the initial peak force (IPF), crush force efficiency (CFE) and specific energy absorption (SEA) for the concentric plunger with various taper angles. It was found that the concentric plunger affected the tube impact response. Comparison with plain circular tube was carried out and {{it was found that the}} concentric plunger improved the impact response of the tube especially in term of initial peak force...|$|R
50|$|Micro {{switches}} {{are very}} widely used; among their applications are appliances, machinery, industrial controls, vehicles, convertible tops {{and many other}} places for control of electrical circuits. They are usually rated to carry current in control circuits only, although some switches can be directly used to control small motors, solenoids, lamps, or other devices. Special low-force versions can sense coins in vending machines, or with a vane attached, air flow. Micro switches may be directly operated by a mechanism, or may be packaged {{as part of a}} pressure, flow, or temperature switch, operated by a sensing mechanism such as a Bourdon tube. In these latter applications, the repeatability of the actuator position when switching happens is essential for long-term accuracy. A motor driven cam (usually relatively slow-speed) and one or more micro switches form a timer mechanism. The snap-switch mechanism can be enclosed in a metal housing including actuating levers, <b>plungers</b> or rollers, <b>forming</b> a limit switch useful for control of machine tools or electrically-driven machinery.|$|R
40|$|The {{narrow neck}} press and blow (NNPB) process was {{introduced}} to gain better control over glass distribution in the container. The improved control over glass distribution has enabled significant reduction in glass weight of up to 33 % without adversely affecting the mechanical performance of the container. A key component in the above process is the <b>plunger,</b> used to <b>form</b> the cavity in the parison during the forming stage. The function of the plunger is to evenly distribute the glass within the blank mould cavity and to aid the removal of thermal energy from the internal surface of the parison. Whilst there has been considerable attention given {{to the requirements of}} the glass, e. g. viscosity, gob weight, temperature and homogeneity, there has been little attention given to the plunger material, cooling system design and the plunger operating environment. The work presented here gives an overview of some of the problems associated with the NNPB process and the research being conducted at the University of Northumbria in collaboration with a major European glass container producer...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The LOMOLD {{process is}} a new plastic {{moulding}} process being researched at the University of Stellenbosch. The process essentially combines injection moulding and compression moulding. Molten plastic is forced into the mould cavity using a plunger. This <b>plunger</b> then <b>forms</b> part of the cavity wall. The plunger face must therefore follow the geometry of the part. Rapid Tooling evolved from Rapid Prototyping. There are two categories of Rapid Tooling: indirect and direct rapid tools. Indirect rapid tools are manufactured by using a master pattern to form the mould cavity. The accuracy of the mould cavity depends heavily on {{the accuracy of the}} master pattern. The master pattern is usually produced using Rapid Prototyping technology. Direct rapid tools use Rapid Prototyping technology to build the mould through and additive, layer by layer process or a subtractive process. This research investigates the use of Rapid Tools for the LOMOLD process. Aluminium Filled Epoxy Tooling (AFET) represents the indirect technology and CNC-machined tooling the direct technology. Both of these technologies are available at the University of Stellenbosch. Parts are manufactured on these tools using an experimental LOMOLD machine. These two technologies are compared in terms of part accuracy, tool lead time, tool cost and part cost. The research concluded that the only advantage the AFET has over the CNC-machined tool is a shorter manufacturing lead-time. In terms of tool cost, tool life, part geometric accuracy, part cost and cycle time the CNC tool is superior. Therefore the application of AFET is limited to small volume, prototype or pre-production runs for tool design confirmation, part functional testing and part appearance testing. It is also demonstrated that a cooling system on the AFET tool has no significant influence on the tool performance and should therefore, especially for production runs less than 150 parts, not be included in the tool to save on tool cost. Another conclusion is that the LOMOLD process is not consistent enough for a production process. This statement could be limited to the machine used for the research but to prove this statement wrong, the machine must be improved and more investigation is required...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that a newly formed glass {{container}} will only possess a very small fraction of its theoretical strength. This suggests that damage occurs {{on the surface of}} the glass melt during the forming process due to glass to mould contact and hot glass handling. It might be expected that any damage inflicted on the surface of a glass article during manufacture would heal at the elevated manufacturing temperatures used, however this does not appear to be true. Therefore, the actual mechanism by which glass strength is reduced during forming needs to be fully understood and the work presented in this thesis addresses this problem. Experiments, therefore, have been carried out here which simulate the formation of glass articles using an experimental pressing rig by systematically altering processing parameters such as the mould material, surface fmish of the mould, pressing temperature and atmosphere. Processing parameters that are used industrially for the formation of glass containers were generally reproduced wherever possible in order to investigate the glass-to-mould interaction. The interaction of both a cast iron mould material and carbon-carbon composite materials with a soda-lime-silica glass were examined using the techniques of scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy in order to determine the type and extent of surface damage formed. The surfaces of the pressed glass samples made were found to contain defects of embedded particles and indented dimples. The embedded particles found were usually due to bulk material transfer from the plunger material used. The texture found {{on the surface of the}} pressed glass samples was found to be directly affected by the surface fmish of the plunger. Pressing glass samples using a cast iron plunger at an initial plunger temperature below 450 °C resulted in a randomly rippled 'chilled' surface. As the initial temperature of the plunger was increased, the surface texture of the pressed glass became a closer replica of the plunger surface. The use of vacuum assistance to form the glass samples also resulted in the surface of the pressed glass becoming a closer replica of the original plunger surface, even at lower pressing temperatures. The surfaces of the cast iron and carbon-carbon composite plungers appeared to have been affected by the initial plunger temperatures used. As the initial pressing temperature was increased, the amount of oxidation for both material types increased. In the case of the carbon-carbon composite materials investigated, both the matrix and fibres were found to have broken down at the pressing temperatures used. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, of the pressed glass surfaces and the plunger materials indicated that sodium ions had migrated from the glass melt to the <b>plunger</b> surface during <b>forming...</b>|$|R
