AbstractThe {{aim of the}} study was to describe the quantitative and qualitative characteristics referring to the culture of the soy (Glicine max), with the purpose of ensilage of entire plant. In Brazil, the cultivated area of soy in 2010 / 2011, according to data by Embrapa (2011) was 24, 2 million hectares. The irregularity of the rain occurrence has made impracticable economically many soy crops for the production of grains for the reduction of the productivity and increase of the costs of the production, having made possible the use of the entire plant of soy as ensilage for the animal feeding. The advantages of using ensilage of entire soy plant in comparison to other grassy ones, as the zea and sorghum ones, are the biggest joined average values, of 18 % crude protein, 31 % of dry substance, 32 % of acid detergent fiber and 41 % of neutral detergent fiber, 23 % of ether extract and average <b>productivity</b> of seven <b>tons</b> per hectare, where the participation of grains in the ensilage represents 35 %, allowing the producer to add greater value to its final item and not to be dependent on the alternating prices of domestic market in harvest and on the increase in price during the period between harvests in order to purchase by-products of the soy processing, having as main limitation the competition between soy ensilage and grains sales...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{municipal}} waste processing plant in Kazakhstan was opened in December 2007 in Almaty with support of local akimat. Vtorma-Ecology Plant covered 90% of the city’s utilization of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW). At that time Almaty accumulated about 600 tons of garbage per year. During 4.5-5 years, the company was to pay back $28 million investments and reach cost recovery by producing secondary materials - PET flex, plastic pellets, paper, ferrous and non-ferrous metals. But to the economic crisis the price of recyclables has fallen in 1,5-3 times, and the plant {{was not able to}} cover its costs and pay the loan, issued by [...] "KazKom Bank". In October 2010 the plant was mothballed, criminal case of non-payment the wages was opened on Rustem Parmanbekov, director of the plant, and environmental prosecutor's office estimated the environmental damage in the amount of 7 million tenge.In September 2012 Agency for Construction, Housing and Utilities of RK has presented the Program of construction of 41 waste processing plants around Kazakhstan within 10-15 years. Particularly, the Agency plans to open 10 plants until 2015.As the Agency informs, the pilot projects will be launched in Aktobe, Atyrau, Karaganda, Abai, Saran, Shakhtinsk, Kostanay, Pavlodar, Taldykorgan, Taraz, Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kokshetau, etc.These efforts will allow developing specific mechanisms of solid waste management in Kazakhstan and providing investors with one more sphere for investments.First of the objects within the Program is Astana Waste Processing Plant, which was planned to open in October 2012 and cover all city needs in MSW utilization, with its <b>productivity</b> of 400,000 <b>tons</b> per year. The opening ceremony was held on December 24, 2012. This is the second waste processing plant in Kazakhstan after Almaty plant. The Astana plant was built on basis of Spanish technology.As regards to Almaty Plant, which is still not operating, the Agency claims that owners have to deal with their economic problems themselves.The Program also covers Shymkent city, which has a dramatic situation with spontaneously growing dump close to residential areas of the city. For residents of these neighborhoods proximity to the dump has turned into serious health problems. Due to constant acrid smoke and smell of burning people get such diseases as asthma, bronchitis etc.The plant in Shymkent was planned to be built in 2007: [...] "Construction is scheduled to start next spring and finish by fall," [...] - declared the subcontractor in January 2007. But the choice of the landfill and other issues took more time than planned.Only in December 2009 an investment agreement with Shymkent Akimat was signed and area for polygon and plant was defined. In Fall 2011 it was again announced that construction of the plant begins. Municipal budget allocated 430 million tenge for the necessary infrastructure needs. Until {{the end of the year}} builders acquired approximately 20 million tenge.But in April 2012, Akimat refused to continue funding the project. For the moment the project is still frozen. Operation of the plant is now under threat due to insufficient funds for restoration and permanent increase of the area of garbage dump.The Agency for Construction, Housing and Utilities of RK has also named the city of Pavlodar among the first cities, where the plants will be built until 2015. For the moment, Pavlodar Akimat has announced that they have already chosen the place of 100 hectares for the construction of polygon. Work is expected to deploy on the existing city dump.Another plant is planned to be constructed in Karaganda. By today, [...] "Taza Dala" [...] company was founded to manage this project, places for construction and polygon have been chosen. Now there are negotiations being held with several banks to participate in the project.Finally, in December 2012 it was announced that the modern MSW processing plant will be built in Aktau with support of EBRD: 2.4 billion tenge (€12.7 million equivalent) loan to State Communal Enterprise Koktem, Aktau’s waste management company, will co - finance the new integrated mechanical-biological treatment facility and a new sanitary landfill. The project will be co-financed by the Clean Technology Fund which is providing a US$8 million loan.The project will also be supported by a capital grant from the state budget.The Korean Donor Fund provided nearly €300,000 and the EBRDShareholder Special Fund is providing grants of nearly €800,000 for project management, design, engineering, training, operational improvements and other associated spending.|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar os efeitos de lâminas totais de água e de épocas de plantio no número de colmos nas fases de perfilhamento, crescimento e maturação da cana-planta, variedade SP 911049, na produtividade, em toneladas de colmos industriais por hectare (TCH), no açúcar total recuperável por hectare (ATRha- 1) e, também, nos atributos qualitativos da cana-de-açúcar. Os experimentos foram conduzidos em épocas de plantio distintas, maio e agosto de 2010, sob delineamento em blocos ao acaso (DBC), com cinco tratamentos: T 1 - parcela sem irrigação, T 2 - lâmina correspondente a 40 % da irrigação total necessária (ITN), T 3 - 70 % da ITN, T 4 - 100 % da ITN e T 5 - 130 % da ITN e 5 repetições. No cálculo das lâminas totais de água aplicadas em cada tratamento, a ITN foi acrescida da precipitação efetiva considerada durante o período de experimentação. Os tratamentos responderam bem ao aumento da lâmina total de água, apresentando produtividades de até 169 e 151 t ha- 1 de cana-de-açúcar (TCH) e de 25 e 21, 5 t ha- 1 de ATR, para os plantios de maio e agosto de 2010, respectivamente. A irrigação não alterou os atributos qualitativos da cana-de-açúcar para as duas épocas de plantio estudadas. Não houve diferença do diâmetro médio dos colmos nas distintas lâminas totais de água, nas duas épocas de plantio, entretanto o peso médio de colmos sofreu um incremento de 1. 624, 9 para 2. 009, 8 gramas à medida que se aumentou a lâmina total de água de 934 mm para 1. 561 mm, na época de plantio de maio, mas não houve diferença no plantio efetuado em agosto. O comprimento médio de colmos, no plantio de agosto, aumentou de 196, 4 para 231 cm com o incremento da lâmina total de água de 921 para 1. 258 mm, aumento de 18 %, mas no plantio de maio não houve diferença significativa entre os tratamentos. O número de colmos de cana por hectare, no plantio de maio, passou de 71. 346 para 84. 216 à medida que se aumentou a lâmina total de água de 934 mm para 1. 561 mm, aumento de 18 %. Já em agosto obteve-se 108. 023 colmos para uma lâmina total de 1. 189, 38 mm, aumento de 37 % em relação ao tratamento sem irrigação. Nas três fases de desenvolvimento da cana-de-açúcar avaliadas, nas duas épocas de plantio, a variação da lâmina total de água foi mais importante na fase de perfilhamento. O aumento da lâmina total de água proporcionou incremento da produtividade de colmos industriais assim como de Açúcar Total Recuperável para os plantios de cana-de-açúcar efetuados em maio e agosto de 2010, sendo os melhores resultados obtidos para o plantio realizado em maio, destacando-se o fato de não ter sido observada variação dos atributos qualitativos da cana-de-açúcar em decorrência da aplicação de lâminas de irrigação. A irrigação proporcionou incremento de 44, 5 % e 44 % na produtividade de colmos industriais e de 56 % e 35 % na produtividade de Açúcar Total Recuperável para os plantios de cana-de-açúcar efetuados em maio e agosto de 2010, respectivamente, em relação ao tratamento sem irrigação suplementarThe {{object of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} the effects of total water slides and planting epochs {{in the number of}} stems in phases, growth stages and maturity of the cane plant, variation SP 911049, for <b>productivity,</b> in <b>tons</b> of cane per industrial hectare (Know as TCH), total recoverable sugar per hectare (ATRha- 1), as well as qualitative attributes of sugar cane. The experiments were conducted in different planting periods, May and August 2010, in a randomized block design (DBC) with five treatments: T 1 - without irrigation, T 2 water depths corresponding to 40 % of total necessary irrigation (ITN), T 3 - 70 % ITN, T 4 - 100 % ITN and T 5 - 130 % ITN and 5 reputations. To calculate the total water depths applied in each treatment, an ITN was figured taking into consideration the effective rainfall during the experimental period. The treatments well represent the increase in total water depth, representing of 169 and 151 t ha- 1 of sugar cane (TCH), and 25 and 21. 5 Tha- 1 ATR, for the said planting in May and August 2010, respectively. The irrigation did not alter the attributing qualities of the sugar cane for the two periods of planting which were studied. No differences were found in averages of stem dimensions for the varying water depths during the periods studied, resulting in an average stem size of 1. 624, 9 per 2. 009, 8 grams, with an average water depth of 934 mm for 1. 561 mm, for the planting period in May. However, some differences were found during the planting study conducted in August. The average stem dimensions, in August, increased from 196, 4 to 231 cm, with an average water depth of 921 for 1. 258 mm, for an increase of 18 %. The planting in May did not show significant differences between the plantings. The number of stems of sugar cane per hectare during the May plantings ranged from 71, 346 to 84, 216, with the average water depth ranging from 934 mm to 1. 561 mm, increasing 18 %. In August the number of stems of sugar cane per hectare obtained was 108, 023 per total water depth of 1. 189, 38 mm, increasing 37 % in relation to treatments without irrigation. For the three growth phases of sugar cane evaluated during the two planting periods, a variation of total water depth was found to be more important during the growth stage. The increase of water depths in proportion to the stages of industrial production of stalks as to Total Recoverable Sugar for the sugar cane plantings studied in My and August, 2010, resulted in the best being obtained for the planting in May, talking into consideration the fact that we did not see much variation in the sugar cane in regards to the variations of irrigated water depths. Proportional increments of irrigation of 44, 5 % and 44 % in industrial production of the plants and 56 % and 35 % in Total Recoverable Sugar for plantings of sugar cane during May and August, 2010, respectively, in relation to treatment without irrigation supplemented...|$|R
