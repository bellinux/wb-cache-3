50|$|A {{dicentric}} chromosome is an abnormal chromosome with two centromeres. It is formed through {{the fusion of}} two chromosome segments, each with a centromere, resulting {{in the loss of}} acentric fragments (lacking a centromere) and the formation of dicentric fragments. The formation of {{dicentric chromosome}}s has been attributed to genetic processes, such as Robertsonian translocation and <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversion.</b> Dicentric chromosomes have important roles in the mitotic stability of chromosomes and the formation of pseudodicentric chromosomes. Their existence has been linked to certain natural phenomena such as irradiation and have been documented to underlie certain clinical syndromes, notably Kabuki syndrome. The formation of dicentric chromosomes and their implications on centromere function are studied in certain clinical cytogenetics laboratories.|$|E
50|$|Most {{dicentric}} chromosomes {{are known}} to form through chromosomal inversions, which are rotations in regions of a chromosome due to chromosomal breakages or intra-chromosomal recombinations. Inversions that exclude the centromere are known as paracentric inversions, which result in unbalanced gametes after meiosis. During prophase of meiosis I, homologous chromosomes form an inversion loop and crossover occurs. If a <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversion</b> has occurred, one of the products will be acentric, while the other product will be dicentric. The dicentric chromatid is pulled apart during anaphase of meiosis I {{with such force that}} the chromosome breaks at random positions. These broken fragments result in deletions of genes that lead to genetically unbalanced gametes. This can have severe consequences, contributing to the development of genetic disorders such as Kabuki syndrome and Edwards syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|... 1955 {{marked the}} {{publication}} of a complete taxonomic revision of the Genus Clarkia.This was followed by an analysis of three subspecies of Clarkia biloba, which ranged mostly from north to south along the Sierran foothills: ssp. brandegeae being northernmost, more central ssp. biloba, with ssp. australis being southernmost; their primary morphological difference being petal color and shape as well as leaf morphology. The fertility amongst the hybrids was high, except that the northern ssp. brandegeae was the least fertile with the other two, probably caused by a chromosomal rearrangement; it was observed that ssp. brandegeae was also morphologically similar to C. dudleyana. The authors concluded that subspeciation in C. biloba did not follow patterns seen in other plants, but was more disjunct involving [...] "barriers to gene exchange due to spacing of the colonies, supplemented in the northern subspecies by a factor which reduces fertility in heterozygotes."This work was then followed by the now famous publication on Clarkia lingulata in 1956 with M. Roberts. C. lingulata is a [...] "sister species" [...] of Clarkia biloba ssp. australis, morphologically almost identical to each other except that C. lingulata does not have notch in its petals, has a low interspecific fertility, and they differ from each other by a translocation, a <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversion,</b> and one additional chromosome; C. lingulata grows at the southernmost extent of ssp. australis range. They concluded that C. lingulata evolved rapidly and recently from C. biloba:In any event, the transition from one species to the other {{seems to have been a}} rapid process which depended only upon the fixation of one or perhaps two chromosomal alterations, which also led to a morphological and perhaps ecological difference. We are inclined to believe in the present case that the stage was set for subsequent differentiation and speciation by the single step of adding a chromosome to the genome of australis. The close relationship of the genomes of C. lingulata and australis, the geographical juxtaposition the two taxa, and the restricted distribution of the former, suggests to us not only a rapid but also a relatively recent origin of C. lingulata from C. biloba australis.|$|E

40|$|Recent results {{indicate}} that the rate of chromosomal rearrangement in the genus Drosophila is the highest found so far in any eukaryote. This conclusion is based chiefly on the comparative mapping analysis of a single chromosomal element (Muller’s element E) in two species, D. melanogaster and D. repleta, representing the two farthest lineages within the genus (the Sophophora and Drosophila subgenera, respectively). We have extended the analysis to two other chromosomal elements (Muller’s elements A and D) and tested for differences in rate of evolution among chromosomes.

40|$|A {{review of}} our recent {{work on the}} cromosomal {{evolution}} of the Drosophila repleta species group is presented. Most {{studies have focused on}} the buzzatii species complex, a monophyletic set of 12 species which inhabit the deserts of South America and the West Indies. A statistical analysis of the length and breakpoint distribution of the 86 <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversions</b> observed in this complex has shown that inversion length is a selected trait. Rare inversions are usually small while evolutionary successful inversions, fixed and polymorphic, are predominantly of medium size. There is also a negative correlation between length and number of inversions per species. Finally, the distribution of inversion breakpoints along chromosome 2 is non-random, with chromosomal regions which accumulate up to 8 breakpoints (putative "hot spots"). Comparative gene mapping has also been used to investigate the molecular organization and evolution of chromosomes. Using in situ hybridization, 26 genes have been precisely located on the salivary gland chromosomes of D. repleta and D. buzzatii; another nine have been tentatively identified. The results are fully consistent with the currently accepted chromosomal homologies between D. repleta and D. melanogaster, and no evidence for reciprocal translocations or pericentric inversions has been found. The comparison of the gene map of D. repleta chromosome 2 with that of the homologous chromosome 3 R of D. melanogaster shows an extensive reorganization via <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversions</b> and allows to estimate an evolution rate of ~ 1 inversion fixed per million years for this chromosom...|$|R

In Drosophila and in Anopheline mosquitoes most speciation processes seem {{to be associated with}} the establishment of chromosomal rearrangements, particularly of <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversions.</b> It is not known what triggers inversions in natural populations. In the laboratory inversions are commonly generated by X-rays, mutagens or after the activity of certain transposable elements (TEs). The Anopheles gambiae complex is comprised of six sibling species, each one characterized by the presence of fixed <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversions</b> on their chromosomes. Two of these, An. gambiae s. s. and An. arabiensis, are the most important vectors of human malaria and are structured into sub-populations, each carrying a characteristic set of polymorphic chromosomal inversions. We have cloned the breakpoints of the naturally occurring polymorphic inversion In(2 R) d' of An. arabiensis. Analysis of the surrounding sequences demonstrated that adjacent to the distal breakpoint lies a transposable element that we called Odysseus. Characteristics of Odysseus' terminal region and its cytological distribution in different strains as well as within the same strain indicate that Odysseus is an actively transposing element. The presence of Odysseus at the junction of the naturally occurring inversion In(2 R) d' suggests that the inversion may be the result of the TEs activity. Cytological evidence from Drosophila melanogaster has also implicated the hobo transposable element in the generation of certain Hawaiian endemic inversions. This picture supports the hypothesis of the important role of TEs in generating natural inversions...|$|R
40|$|Among the sibling {{species of}} the Afrotropical Anopheles gambiae complex, the nominal taxon (An. gambiae s. str.) is the major malaria vector. Its bionomics suggest a man-dependent {{speciation}} process which involves, in West Africa, various incipient species chromosomally recognized by different combinations of 2 R <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversions.</b> One {{of the most recent}} evolutionary steps of such a speciation process appears to be the chromosomal form Mopti, which is associated with dry season irrigation in arid zones, and is characterized by a remarkable ecological flexibility related to three 2 R alternative arrangements, namely bc, u and +, whose expected karyotypes are found in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The study of this chromosomal polymorphism in samples from a 16 -locality transect in Mali shows wide variations and highly significant correlation with both temporal and spatial climatic differences. Mosquitoes homokaryotypic for 2 Rbc are the actual dry season and arid areas breeders. The regular rise of 2 Rbc frequency, up to fixation, during each dry season, corresponds to the South-North clinal increase of the same arrangement along the transect, from about 30 % in the humid savanna to near fixation in the South-Saharan zone. This coherent ecological genetics case provides full support to the hypothesis of the adaptive nature of <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversions.</b> Moreover, the very peculiar system of combinations of contiguous 2 R inversions, utilized by Mopti as well as by other chromosomal forms of An. gambiae, suggests a process of polygenic reorganization based on linkage disequilibria and involving the inversions as driving selection units...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Typical Williams-Beuren {{syndrome}} (WBS) {{is commonly}} {{caused by a}} ~ 1. 5 Mb - ~ 1. 8 Mb heterozygous deletion of contiguous genes at chromosome region 7 q 11. 23. The majority of WBS cases occurs sporadically but few familial cases of autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported. Recent data demonstrated {{the existence of the}} <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversion</b> polymorphism at the WBS critical region in 7 q 11. 23 in some of the progenitors transmitting the chromosome which shows the deletion in the affected child. In parents having a child affected by WBS the prevalence of such a structural variant has been reported to be much higher (~ 25 - ~ 30 %) than in the general population (~ 1 - ~ 6 %). However, in these previously reported studies {{only a limited number of}} randomly selected patients and non transmitting parents of WBS patients were used as controls, but without specification of any clinical data. Therefore we have undertaken a German population-based molecular cytogenetic investigation. We evaluated the incidence of the <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversion</b> polymorphism at 7 q 11. 23 analyzing interphase nuclei of lymphocytes using a three color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe. Results FISH analysis was carried out on couples with a child affected by WBS as compared to a population sample composed of different normal individuals: Control group I: couples with two healthy children, control group II: couples with fertility problems, planning ICSI and control group III: couples with two healthy children and one child with a chromosome aberration, not involving region 7 q 11. 23. The three color FISH assay showed that the frequency of the <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversion</b> polymorphism at 7 q 11. 23 in couples with a child affected by WBS was 20. 8 % (5 out of 24 pairs) as compared to 8. 3 % (2 out of 24 pairs, control group I), 25 % (4 out of 16 pairs, control group II) and 9. 1 % (1 out of 11 pairs, control group III), respectively (total 7 out of 51 pairs, 13. 8 %). The frequencies differed between the groups, but this was statistically not significant (p > 0. 05, Fisher's test).

However, they cannot be cross-hybridized and, until now, it was unknown how conserved the gene order might be between these two species. We report herein the construction of a genetic linkage map of potato chromosomes based on genomic and cDNA clones from tomato. The potato map was drawn from segregation data derived from the interspecific cross S. phureja X (S. tuberosum X S. chacoense) (2 n = 2 x = 24), and consists of 135 markers defining 12 distinct linkage groups. Nearly all of the tomato probes tested hybridized to potato DNA, and in most cases, the copy number of the employed clones was the same in both species. Furthermore, all clones mapped to the same linkage group in both species. For nine chromosomes, the order of loci appears to be identical in the two species, while for the other three, intrachromosomal rearrangements are apparent, all of which appear to be <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversions</b> with one breakpoint at or near the centromere. These results are consistent with cytogenetic theory, previously untested in plants, which predicts that <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversions</b> will have the least negative effect on fitness and thus be the most likely form of chromosomal rearrangements to survive through evolutionary time.

In principle, a full description of the rate and pattern of change could reveal the limits, if any, to which the eukaryotic genome can accommodate reorganizations. We have constructed a high-density physical map of the largest chromosomal element in Drosophila repleta (chromosome 2) and compared the order and distances between the markers with those on the homologous chromosomal element (3 R) in Drosophila melanogaster. The two species belong to different subgenera (Drosophila and Sophophora, respectively), which diverged 40 – 62 million years (Myr) ago and represent, thus, the farthest lineages within the Drosophila genus. The comparison reveals extensive reshuffling of gene order from centromere to telomere. Using a maximum likelihood method, we estimate that 114 [*]±[*] 14 <b>paracentric</b> <b>inversions</b> have been fixed in this chromosomal element since the divergence of the two species, that is, 0. 9 – 1. 4 inversions fixed per Myr. Comparison with available rates of chromosomal evolution, taking into account genome size, indicates that the Drosophila genome shows the highest rate found so far in any eukaryote. Twenty-one small segments (23 – 599 kb) comprising at least two independent (nonoverlapping) markers appear to be conserved between D. melanogaster and D. repleta. These results are consistent with the random breakage model and do not provide significant evidence of functional constraint of any kind. They support the notion that the Drosophila genome is extraordinarily malleable and has a modular organization. The high rate of chromosomal change also suggests a very limited transferability of the positional information from the Drosophila genome to other insects...|$|R
