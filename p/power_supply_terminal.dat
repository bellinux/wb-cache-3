40|$|Abstract — Clock and Data Recovery (CDR) {{circuits}} {{have been}} used extensively in the receivers of optical communication systems, {{and a variety of}} applications of inter and intra chip communications. The primary design/performance metrics of CDR circuits are clock jitter, lock range, acquisition time, power consumption, silicon area, and noise immunity. The main source of jitter is the power supply noise. The present paper investigates the effects of power supply noise on the jitter performance of the well known dual loop architecture of CDR system. In order to improve the jitter performance of the dual loop CDR system, the VCO alone is replaced by the self-biased Maneatis VCO which is well known for its immunity to power supply noise and process variations. The Maneatis VCO is widely used for microprocessors PLL systems but it is rarely used in CDR systems. The combination of the dual loop architecture and self-biased Maneatis VCO together provides the benefits of both schemes. Simulations were then carried out systematically to determine the capability of the proposed CDR circuit to tolerate power supply noise. The results presented in this paper show that while the conventional dual loop architecture cannot tolerate more than 20 mV@ 10 MHz noise on <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>terminal,</b> the proposed CDR architecture can tolerate up t...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{introduces}} {{techniques for}} power efficient design of power delivery network in multiple voltage-island System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. The first technique is targeted to SoC designs with static voltage assignment, {{while the second}} technique is pertinent to SoC designs with dynamic voltage scaling capability. Conventionally a single level configuration of DC-DC converters, where exactly one converter resides between the power source and each load, is used to deliver currents at appropriate voltage levels to different loads on the chip. In the presence of dynamic voltage scaling capability, each DC-DC converter in this network {{should be able to}} adjust its output voltage. In {{the first part of this}} paper it is shown that in a SoC design with static voltage assignment, a multi-level tree topology of suitably chosen DC-DC converters and voltage regulators between the power source and loads can result in higher power efficiency in the power delivery network. The problem is formulated as a combinatorial problem and is efficiently solved by dynamic programming. In the second part of the paper, a new technique is presented to design the power delivery network for a SoC design to support dynamic voltage scaling. In this technique the power delivery network is composed of two layers. In the first layer, DC-DC converters with fixed output voltages are used to generate all voltage levels that are needed by different loads in the SoC design. In the second layer of the power delivery network, a power switch network is used to dynamically connect the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>terminals</b> each load to the appropriate DC-DC converter output in the first layer. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of both techniques. Index Terms — Low-power design, power delivery network, voltage regulator, DC-DC converter, energy efficiency, voltag...|$|R
