40|$|Abstract: The <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> of a {{continuous}} digitallymodulated signal is often analyzed from its samples {{taken at the}} Nyquist rate. This, however, may involve a significant error. It has been claimed, based on an illustrative example, that the <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> of {{a continuous}} signal may be arbitrary large while the <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> of the corresponding sampled signal is limited [10]. A validity of this example has been questioned in [11, 13] based on a flaw in [10]. In this paper, we demonstrate that the original illustrative example requires a small modification only to remove the flaw. It is also demonstrated that the continuous <b>peak</b> <b>factor,</b> in its traditional definition, may be arbitrary large while the sampled <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> and the signal energy are bounded. An upper bound on the continuous <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> of a BPSK sequence is derived...|$|E
40|$|In the {{structural}} design of tall buildings, peak {{factors have been}} widely used to predict mean extreme responses of tall buildings under wind excitations. Vanmarcke's <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> is directly related to an explicit measure of structural reliability against a Gaussian response process. We review the use of this factor for time-variant reliability design by comparing it to the conventional Davenport's <b>peak</b> <b>factor.</b> Based on the asymptotic theory of statistical extremes, a new closed-form <b>peak</b> <b>factor,</b> the so-called Gamma <b>peak</b> <b>factor,</b> can be obtained for a non-Gaussian resultant response characterized by a Rayleigh distribution process. Using the Gamma <b>peak</b> <b>factor,</b> a combined <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> method was developed for predicting the expected maximum resultant responses of a building undergoing lateral-torsional vibration. The effects of the standard deviation ratio of two sway components and the inter-component correlation on the evaluation of peak resultant response were also investigated. Utilizing wind tunnel data derived from synchronous multi-pressure measurements, we carried out a wind-induced time history response analysis of the Commonwealth Advisory Aeronautical Research Council (CAARC) standard tall building to validate the applicability of the Gamma <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> to the prediction of the peak resultant acceleration. Results from the building example indicated that the use of the Gamma <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> enables accurate predictions to be made of the mean extreme resultant acceleration responses for dynamic serviceability performance design of modern tall buildings...|$|E

The activity monitor is implemented as on-chip hardware. Two models, one for test sets with <b>peak</b> activity <b>factor</b> of 1 and the other for test sets with <b>peak</b> activity <b>factor</b> lower than 1 have been proposed. In test sets with <b>peak</b> activity <b>factors</b> of 1, the test time reduction accomplished depends upon an average activity factor of αin. For low αin, about 50 % test time reduction is analytically shown. With moderate activity, αin = 0. 5, simulated test data gives about 25 % test time reduction for ITC 02 benchmarks. BIST with dynamic clock showed about 19 % test time reduction for the largest ISCAS 89 circuits in which the hardware activity monitor and scan clock control required about 2 - 3 % hardware overhead. In test sets with <b>peak</b> activity <b>factors</b> lower than 1, the test time reduction depends on an input activity factor of αin and an output activity factor of αout. For low αin and high αout, a test time reduction of about 50 % is analytically shown.

40|$|The peak {{amplitude}} of a waveform {{for a particular}} spectrum depends on the phases of its harmonic components, and lower {{peak amplitude}}s give better signal-to-noise ratios. Most previous work on peak amplitude reduction has only considered individual spectra, but applications such as wavetable synthesis require multiple wavetables. A recent study compared various phase selection methods for multiple wavetable synthesis and found that genetic algorithm (GA) optimization gave peak amplitude results 10 - 25 % lower than other methods. Various phase selection methods are compared with regard to group additive synthesis, a special case of multiple wavetable synthesis, where each wavetable contains a distinct subset of the harmonics. The results show that GA and simulated annealing optimization are consistently good, and usually outperform random phase selection, Schroeder's method, van den Bos's method, and Pumplin's method {{with one or two}} wavetables. The GA runs several times faster than simulated annealing and strikes the best balance between efficiency and effectiveness. With three or more wavetables, the random, van den Bos, Pumplin, GA, and simulated annealing methods give about the same results. Group additive synthesis <b>peak</b> <b>factors</b> are up to 30 % worse than their wavetable synthesis counterparts, unless wavetable matching and peak-factor optimization are integrated. While multiple wavetable synthesis allows lower <b>peak</b> <b>factors</b> and relative spectral errors than group additive synthesis, group additive synthesis has the advantage that it allows better and more intuitive control than multiple wavetable synthesis. The GA and simulated annealing low-peak methods help get the best performance out of both multiple wavetable synthesis and group additive synthesis...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of a water supply network, the use of {{traditional}} formulas of the <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> may lead to over-dimensioning the network pipelines, especially in small towns. This discrepancy is probably due to changes in human habits as a consequence of a general improvement of living conditions. Starting from these considerations, and given the availability of a wide random sample data, an analysis of the water demand for several towns in Puglia was carried out, leading to the definition of a relationship between the above mentioned <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> and the number of inhabitants, based on a stochastic approach. An interesting outcome {{of this study is that}} {{the design of}} water supply network is possible without considering the use of monthly and weekly peak factors, since the current water demands appear not specifically sensitive to these variations; moreover, the magnitude of the <b>peak</b> <b>factor,</b> as shown by measured data, is considerably lower compared to literature values, especially for small towns...|$|E

In the expression of G a <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> g is introduced to account for the maxima of the response dynamical displacement Xd(t), which is a zero mean stationary Gaussian process. The <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> is derived by assuming that the upcrossings of a given level are a Poisson process, which is deemed very conservative by several authors. Thus, other ways for computing g are proposed herein preserving its classical definition. They are: (1) the use of the envelope of the response process; (2) the solution of the backward Kolmogorov equation; (3) the use of some approximate formulae such as those by Preumont, Lutes et al., and Vanmarcke.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{generating}} ensembles of artificial non-stationary earthquake accelerograms compatible with a given (target) response/design spectrum is cast on a stochastic basis. The design {{spectrum of the}} European aseismic code provisions (EC 8) for various soil conditions and damping ratios {{is used as a}} paradigm of a design/target spectrum. The generated accelerograms are construed as realizations of a non-stationary random process; they are char-acterized in the frequency domain by a parametrically defined evolutionary power spectrum (EPS). An appropriate least squared optimization problem is formulated for the determination of the parameters of the EPS. The solution of this problem involves the incorporation of a “peak factor” which is used to re-late the target spectrum to the EPS in a probabilistic context. To this end, a comprehensive Monte Carlo study is undertaken to estimate numerically the statistical properties of the <b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> from appropriately computed popula-tions, and to derive polynomial expressions for the median frequency-dependent peak factors (<b>peak</b> <b>factor</b> spectra). These expressions are used in conjunction with the herein adopted optimization problem to determine EPSs compatible with the EC 8 design spectrum.

The NewWave theory, which represents the most probable surface elevation under a large crest, is adopted. The analytical solutions of the surface elevation, velocity potential and wave force exerted on the vertical wall are derived, {{up to the second}} order. Then, a parametric study is made on the interaction between nonlinear focused wave groups and a vertical wall by considering the effects of angles of incidence, wave steepness, focal positions, water depth, frequency bandwidth and the <b>peak</b> lifting <b>factor.</b> Results show that the wave force on the vertical wall for obliquely-incident wave groups is larger than that for normally-incident waves. The normalized peak crest of wave forces reduces with the increase of wave steepness. With the increase of the distance of focal positions from the vertical wall, the peak crest of surface elevation, although fluctuates, decreases gradually. Both the normalized peak crest and adjacent crest and trough of wave forces become larger for shallower water depth. For focused wave groups reflected by a vertical wall, the frequency bandwidth has little effects on the peak crest of wave elevation or forces, but the adjacent crest and trough become smaller for larger frequency bandwidth. There is no significant change of the peak crest and adjacent trough of surface elevation and wave forces for variation of the <b>peak</b> lifting <b>factor.</b> However, the adjacent crest increases with the increase of the <b>peak</b> lifting <b>factor...</b>|$|R
