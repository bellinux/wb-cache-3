5|$|A {{well-known}} {{variant of}} the sun disc design is the sun disc with 16 red rays in a Siemens star formation, which was also historically used by Japan's military, particularly the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The ensign, known in Japanese as the , was first adopted as the War flag on May 15, 1870, and was used {{until the end of}} World WarII in 1945. It was re-adopted on June 30, 1954, and is now used as the war flag and naval ensign of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). In Korea and China, this flag still carries a negative connotation. The JMSDF also employs the use of a masthead <b>pennant.</b> First adopted in 1914 and readopted in 1965, the masthead <b>pennant</b> contains a simplified version of the naval ensign at the hoist end, {{with the rest of the}} <b>pennant</b> colored white. The ratio of the <b>pennant</b> is between 1:40 and 1:90.|$|E
5|$|Each season, one American League (AL) team {{wins the}} <b>pennant,</b> {{signifying}} {{that they are}} the league's champion and have the right to play in the World Series against the champion of the National League. The <b>pennant</b> was presented to the team with the best win–loss record each year through the 1968 season, after which the American League Championship Series (ALCS) was introduced to decide the <b>pennant</b> winner. The first modern World Series was played in 1903 and, after a hiatus in 1904, has taken place every season except 1994, when a players' strike forced the cancellation of the postseason. The current American League <b>pennant</b> holders are the Houston Astros who won in October 2017.|$|E

500|$|By <b>pennants,</b> the San Francisco Giants (formerly the New York Giants) (23 National League <b>pennants,</b> 27 playoff appearances) are the winningest {{team in the}} National League.

The Philadelphia Phillies won the league in back-to-back seasons in 2008 and 2009, becoming the first National League team to do so since the Braves in 1995 and 1996. Before 1903 there was no World Series {{as we know it}} today because the leagues were only loosely affiliated.

5000|$|From a team perspective, {{the golden}} age of {{baseball}} (using the years 1918-1964 as a guideline) was dominated by the American League's New York Yankees, who won 29 <b>pennants</b> and 20 World Series titles between 1918 and 1964. [...] To expound on that figure, in the National League, it took three clubs combined to win 27 <b>pennants</b> (nine each) during that same timeframe, those teams being the St. Louis Cardinals, Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants, all of whom were dominant in their own right. In addition, the N.L.'s Chicago Cubs tallied 6 N.L. <b>pennants</b> (none until 2016) and the A.L.'s Detroit Tigers snared four A.L. <b>pennants</b> during that same time, the second highest total in the junior circuit after the Bronx Bombers' historic 29.|$|R

5|$|As a {{major league}} manager, Alston led Dodgers teams to seven National League (NL) pennants and four world {{championship}}s. His 1955 team was the only World Series championship team while the club was in Brooklyn; they clinched the NL <b>pennant</b> earlier in the calendar year than any previous <b>pennant</b> winner in league history.

5|$|Bosman and Kolben's {{descriptions}} went largely unnoticed until 1771, {{when the}} Welsh naturalist Thomas <b>Pennant,</b> in his Synopsis of Quadrupeds, used the descriptions, {{as well as}} his personal experience with a captive specimen, as a basis for consistently differentiating the spotted hyena from the striped. The description given by <b>Pennant</b> was precise enough to be included by Johann Erxleben in his Systema regni animalis by simply translating Pennant's text into Latin. Crocuta was finally recognised as a separate genus from Hyaena in 1828.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the history}} of the National League (94 years), the <b>pennant</b> was {{presented}} to the team with the best win–loss record at the end of the season. The first modern World Series was played in 1903, and after a hiatus in 1904, continued until 1994, when a players' strike forced the cancellation of the postseason, and resumed in 1995. In 1969, the league split into two divisions, and the teams with the best records in each division played one another in the NLCS to determine the <b>pennant</b> winner. The format of the NLCS was changed from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven format for the 1985 postseason. In 1995, an additional playoff series was added when Major League Baseball restructured the two divisions in each league into three. , the winners of the Eastern, Central, and Western Divisions, as well as one wild card team, play in the National League Division Series, a best-of-five playoff to determine the opponents who will play for the <b>pennant.</b>|$|E
