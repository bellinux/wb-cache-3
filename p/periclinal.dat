50|$|Three phenotypes of {{chimeric}} redwoods {{have been}} noted: sectorial, mericlinal and <b>periclinal.</b> In sectorial mutants, albino cells are present vertically through all cell layers, with genotype boundaries usually {{parallel to the}} stem. Mericlinal trees have mutant cells in only some cell layers and have an unstable phenotype; the albino cells can disappear and reappear in successive years. A <b>periclinal</b> chimera has both mutant and normal cells distributed horizontally across the tip of each bud propagating at equal rates, leading to a very stable phenotype.|$|E

These dwarf grapevines tend to have short internodes and prefer to grow flowers instead of tendrils. They grow from 1 foot to 2 feet in height and produce {{clusters}} with a size on average of 4 inches. It is simple to cultivate in greenhouses and grows year round. Its purpose was to create an easy tool with which to conduct grapevine research. The grape was developed by grape rootstock breeder Dr. Peter Cousins of the USDA.|$|E
50|$|Cells {{around the}} {{blisters}} resemble meristematic cells with denser cytoplasms and smaller vacuoles. Mycelial development is sparse on the leaf surface. Hyphae growth is subcuticle and intercellular in the epidermal layer. There {{is no evidence}} of hyphae growing into the mesophyll layer nor into epidermal and cuticle layers beyond the lesions whereas T. Deformans does cross into the mesophyll layer.Lower epidermal cells in diseased tissue are elongated. Anticlinal divisions are likely while <b>periclinal</b> and oblique divisions are definitive.

50|$|The {{cells of}} the {{epidermis}} are structurally and functionally variable. Most plants have an epidermis that is a single cell layer thick. Some plants like Ficus elastica and Peperomia, which have <b>periclinal</b> cellular division within the protoderm of the leaves, have an epidermis with multiple cell layers. Epidermal cells are tightly linked {{to each other and}} provide mechanical strength and protection to the plant. The walls of the epidermal {{cells of the}} above ground parts of plants contain cutin, and are covered with a cuticle. The cuticle reduces water loss to the atmosphere, it is sometimes covered with wax in smooth sheets, granules, plates, tubes or filaments. The wax layers give some plants a whitish or bluish surface color. Surface wax acts as a moisture barrier and protects the plant from intense sunlight and wind. The underside of many leaves have a thinner cuticle than the top side, and leaves of plants from dry climates often have thickened cuticles to conserve water by reducing transpiration.The epidermal tissue includes several differentiated cell types: epidermal cells, guard cells, subsidiary cells, and epidermal hairs (trichomes). The epidermal cells are the most numerous, largest, and least specialized. These are typically more elongated in the leaves of monocots than in those of dicots.|$|E
50|$|An {{overturned}} anticline is an asymmetrical anticline with a limb {{that has}} been tilted beyond perpendicular so that the beds in that limb have basically flipped over and may dip {{in the same direction}} {{on both sides of the}} axial plane. If the angle between the limbs is large (70-120 degrees), then the fold is an open fold, but if the angle between the limbs is small (30 degrees or less), then the fold is a tight fold. If an anticline plunges (i.e., the anticline crest is inclined to the Earth's surface), it will form Vs on a geologic map view that point in the direction of plunge. A plunging anticline has a hinge that is not parallel to the earth's surface. All anticlines and synclines have some degree of plunge. <b>Periclinal</b> folds are a type of anticlines that have a well-defined, but curved hinge line and are doubly plunging and thus elongate domes.Folds in which the limbs dip toward the hinge and display a more U-like shape are called synclines. They usually flank the sides of anticlines and display opposite characteristics. A syncline's oldest rock strata are in its outer limbs; the rocks become progressively younger toward its hinge. A monocline is a bend in the strata resulting in a local steepening in only one direction of dip. Monoclines have the shape of a carpet draped over a stairstep.|$|E
40|$|The <b>periclinal</b> {{walls of}} cambial cells in {{neighboring}} lineages (rows) {{may not be}} parallel when viewed in their radial aspect. This lack of longitudinal parallelism may be so extensive that in active cambium pairs of cells from neighboring rows may be in contact only along restricted segments. This means that the initial cells, rather than farming a continuous layer, may be arranged in an irregular network pattern from which some parts project inward or outward from the layer of their mutual cantacts. The longitudinal nonparallelism of cambial cells becomes more pronounced during symplasitic radial growth. Unequal <b>periclinal</b> divisions counteract this, and in initial cells abscission of the parts projecting from the layer of mutual contact occurs. When the cambium passes from a period of activity to a Period of rest a continuous layer of initials is reestabhshed. This involves elongation by intrusive growth of those cells previously shortened {{as the result of}} irregular <b>periclinal</b> divisions. The division walls in cambial cells may be warped, that is they change their orientation along the longitudinal direction perhaps even similar to an aircraft propeller. A division wall may thus be <b>periclinal</b> {{in one part of the}} cell and anticlinal in another...|$|E

30|$|In A. thaliana, {{adventitious}} roots can sporadically {{emerge from}} endodermal {{cells in the}} stem and from the pericycle in hypocotyls [24, 84]. In rice, the crown root primordia originate from ground meristem cells in the parenchyma adjacent to the peripheral cylinder of the vascular bundles in stems [40]; crown root primordia are established before the emergence of stem leaves [40]. The development of crown roots has been previously described in detail [40]. Briefly, crown root primordia initial cells are produced by <b>periclinal</b> divisions of parenchyma cells (stage Cr 1), followed by {{the establishment of the}} epidermis–endodermis initial cells, central cylinder cells, and root cap initial cells (stage Cr 2). The QHB [47] and ORYZA SATIVA SCARECROW (OsSCR) [46] genes, which are specifically expressed in the QC and endodermis, respectively, are first expressed in the outer layer derived from the first <b>periclinal</b> division (Cr 1) of parenchyma cells. Two layers, the epidermis and endodermis, are then established in stage Cr 3 by <b>periclinal</b> divisions of the epidermis–endodermis initial. The endodermal cells then form cortical cells via several <b>periclinal</b> divisions of the endodermis initial (stage Cr 4). Expression of OsSCR is downregulated in the daughter cortex cells. The columella is formed by <b>periclinal</b> divisions that occur during stage Cr 5, and the large central metaxylem is also formed at this time. Basic root organization is completed in step Cr 5, at which time all root tissues are visible. Root growth is preceded by the induced cell death of epidermal cells in the node external to the tip of the root primordium [70, 86].|$|E
30|$|Mitosis (Fig.  2 b) in the <b>periclinal</b> {{direction}} from the PWC formed two daughter cells, one inner and the other outer (Fig.  2 c). Successive observation indicated that the inner one {{is associated with the}} formation of the inner layer of cells, while the outer one is associated with the formation of the outer layer of cells (Fig.  2 d). Continuous <b>periclinal</b> cell division from the inner layer (Fig.  2 d) was observed to result in more layers of cells (Fig.  2 f). In addition, continuous anticlinal cell division from the outer layer (Fig.  2 e) was observed to result in expansion of the epidermis. We have observed a large number of successive dissection slides and found that the inner layer cells only performed 1 – 2 <b>periclinal</b> division. Continuous cell divisions resulted in 2 – 3 layers of cells to form a sporangial wall structure (Fig.  2 f).|$|E
40|$|SummaryPlants have a {{remarkable}} potential for sustained (indeterminate) postembryonic growth. Following their specification {{in the early}} embryo, tissue-specific precursor cells first establish tissues and later maintain them postembryonically. The mechanisms underlying these processes are largely unknown. Here we define local control of oriented, <b>periclinal</b> cell division as the mechanism underlying both the establishment and maintenance of vascular tissue. We identify an auxin-regulated basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor dimer as a critical regulator of vascular development. Due {{to a loss of}} <b>periclinal</b> divisions, vascular tissue gradually disappears in bHLH-deficient mutants; conversely, ectopic expression is sufficient for triggering <b>periclinal</b> divisions. We show that this dimer operates independently of tissue identity but is restricted to a small vascular domain by integrating overlapping transcription patterns of the interacting bHLH proteins. Our work reveals a common mechanism for tissue establishment and indeterminate vascular development and provides a conceptual framework for developmental control of local cell divisions...|$|E

40|$|In the cambium of linden {{producing}} {{wood with}} {{short period of}} grain inclination change (2 - 4 years), the intensive reorientation of cells takes place. This is possible mainly through an intrusive growth of cell ends from one radial file entering space between tangential walls of neighboring file and through unequal <b>periclinal</b> divisions {{that occur in the}} "initial surface". The intrusive growth is located on the longitudinal edge of a fusiform cell close to the end, and causes deviation of cell ends in a neighbouring file from the initial surface. Unequal <b>periclinal</b> division divides a cell with a deviated end into two derivatives, unequal in size. The one of them, which inherits the deviated end, leaves the initial surface becoming a xylem or phloem mother cell. This means that the old end is eliminated. The intensity of intrusive growth and unequal <b>periclinal</b> divisions is decisive for the velocity of cambial cell reorientation. The oriented intrusive growth occurs only in the initial cells. For that reason, changes in cell-ends position do not occur within one packet of cells but are distinct between neighbouring packets...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary root}} of Arabidopsis has a simple {{cellular}} organisation. The fixed radial cell pattern results from stereotypical cell divisions {{that occur in}} the meristem. Here we describe the characterisation of schizoriza (scz), a mutant with defective radial patterning. In scz mutants, the subepidermal layer (ground tissue) develops root hairs. Root hairs normally only form on epidermal cells of wildtype plants. Moreover, extra <b>periclinal</b> divisions (new wall parallel to surface of the root) occur in the scz root resulting in the formation of supernumerary layers in the ground tissue. Both scarecrow (scr) and short root (shr) suppress the extra <b>periclinal</b> divisions characteristic of scz mutant roots. This results in the formation of a single layered ground tissue in the double mutants. Cells of this layer develop root hairs, indicating that mis-specification of the ground tissue in scz mutants is uncoupled to the cell division defect. This suggests that during the development of the ground tissue SCZ has two distinct roles: (1) it acts as a suppressor of epidermal fate in the ground tissue, and (2) it is required to repress <b>periclinal</b> divisions in the meristem. It may act in the same pathway as SCR and SHR...|$|E
40|$|Leaf {{primordia}} of the lam- 1 mutant of Nicotiana sylvestris grow {{normally in}} length but remain bladeless throughout development. The blade initiation site is {{established at the}} normal time and position in lam- 1 primordia. Anticlinal divisions proceed normally in the outer L 1 and L 2 layers, but the inner L 3 cells fail to establish the <b>periclinal</b> divisions that normally generate the middle mesophyll core. The lam- 1 mutation also blocks formation of blade mesophyll from distal L 2 cells. This suggests that LAM- 1 controls a common step in initiation of blade tissue from the L 2 and L 3 lineage of the primordium. Another recessive mutation (fat) was isolated in N. sylvestris that induces abnormal <b>periclinal</b> divisions in the mesophyll during blade initiation and expansion. This generates a blade approximately twice its normal thickness by doubling the number of mesophyll cell layers from four to approximately eight. Presumably, the fat mutation defines a negative regulator involved in repression of <b>periclinal</b> divisions in the blade. The lam- 1 fat double mutant shows radial proliferation of mesophyll cells at the blade initiation site. This produces a highly disorganized, club-shaped blade that appears to represent an additive effect of the lam- 1 and fat mutations on blade founder cells...|$|E

40|$|In Actinidia arguta, the I tunc {{layer is}} formed by four cell {{complexes}} which descend from single initials.

Blue-light dependent positioning of both organelles is mediated by the blue-light receptor phototropin and controlled by the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, however, it seems that chloroplast movement requires short, fine actin filaments organized at the chloroplast edge, whereas nuclear movement does cytoplasmic, thick actin bundles intimately associated with the nucleus.

This work applies this technique to study the changes of intracellular properties in response to environmental changes. In a number of plant cells, chloroplasts change their positions for optimizing photosynthetic light absorption.

Comparing with other micro-manipulative methods, dielectrophoresis is a relative simple method for investigating the microscopic mechanisms involved in chloroplast repositioning. Leaves of Egeria densa were subjected to different lighting conditions before conducting dielectrophoresis. Under dim light, chloroplasts situate on the <b>periclinal</b> wall.
