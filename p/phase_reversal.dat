25|$|In a {{rectangular}} jet, the instability can show as asymmetric cell distortions. The asymmetry sends waves {{back to the}} nozzle which sets up a Class III feedback loop and a strong periodic dipole sound field; it is called screech tone. Powell first described the phenomenon and because of application to military aircraft and potential structural fatigue, much subsequent work has been done. The sound field is sufficiently intense for it to appear on a shadowgraph {{as shown in the}} figure on the right (from M.G. Davies) for {{a rectangular}} supersonic jet.

25|$|Steady-state {{visually}} evoked potentials (SSVEPs) use potentials {{generated by}} exciting the retina, using visual stimuli modulated at certain frequencies. SSVEP's stimuli are often formed from alternating checkerboard patterns {{and at times}} simply use flashing images. The frequency of the <b>phase</b> <b>reversal</b> of the stimulus used can be clearly distinguished in the spectrum of an EEG; this makes detection of SSVEP stimuli relatively easy. SSVEP {{has proved to be}} successful within many BCI systems. This is due to several factors, the signal elicited is measurable in as large a population as the transient VEP and blink movement and electrocardiographic artefacts do not affect the frequencies monitored. In addition, the SSVEP signal is exceptionally robust; the topographic organization of the primary visual cortex is such that a broader area obtains afferents from the central or fovial region of the visual field. SSVEP does have several problems however. As SSVEPs use flashing stimuli to infer a user's intent, the user must gaze at one of the flashing or iterating symbols in order to interact with the system. It is, therefore, likely that the symbols could become irritating and uncomfortable to use during longer play sessions, which can often last more than an hour which may not be an ideal gameplay.|$|E

The {{roles of}} interdecadal {{oscillations}} in cli-matic regime shifts, which are observed as rapid strength {{changes in the}} Aleutian low in winter and spring sea-sons, have been analyzed. A regime shift results from simultaneous <b>phase</b> <b>reversals</b> between pentadecadal and bidecadal variations, which synchronize with one an-other at a relative period of three. The pentadecadal variation, which is observed in both winter and spring seasons, provides the basic timescale of regime shifts, while the bidecadal variation, which is observed only in winter, characterizes the rapidity of the shifts.

5000|$|Some {{professional}} systems use a phase-reversal of the CTCSS tone {{at the end}} of {{a transmission}} to eliminate the squelch crash or squelch tail. This is common with General Electric Mobile Radio and Motorola systems. When the user releases his push-to-talk button the CTCSS tone does a phase shift for about 200 milliseconds. In older systems, the tone decoders used mechanical reeds to decode CTCSS tones. When audio at a resonant pitch was fed into the reed, it would resonate / vibrate, which would turn on the speaker audio. The end-of-transmission <b>phase</b> <b>reversal</b> (called [...] "reverse burst" [...] by Motorola and [...] "squelch tail elimination" [...] or [...] "STE" [...] by GE [...] ) caused the reed to abruptly stop vibrating which would cause the receive audio to instantly mute. Initially, a phase shift of 180 degrees was used, but experience showed that a shift of ±120 to 135 degrees was optimal in halting the mechanical reeds. These systems often have audio muting logic set for CTCSS only. If a transmitter without the <b>phase</b> <b>reversal</b> feature is used, the squelch can remain unmuted for as long as the reed continues to vibrate—up to 1.5 seconds {{at the end of}} a transmission as it coasts to a stop (sometimes referred to as the [...] "flywheel effect" [...] or called [...] "freewheeling"). Thus, there is one caveat about all CTCSS being interchangeable—if the phase changing system exists then the shift angle must match. Note that the hardware used to implement the [...] "reverse burst" [...] / [...] "squelch tail elimination" [...] system is all contained in the transmitter.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} Fresnel zoneplate antenna is {{the circular}} half-wave zoneplate invented {{in the nineteenth}} century. The basic idea is to divide a plane aperture into circular zones {{with respect to a}} chosen focal point on the basis that all radiation from each zone arrives at the focal point in phase within ±π/2 range. If the radiation from alternate zones is suppressed or shifted in phase by π, an approximate focus is obtained and a feed can be placed there to collect the received energy effectively. Despite its simplicity, the half-wave zoneplate remained mainly as an optical device for a long time, primarily because its efficiency is too low (less than 20%) and the sidelobe level of its radiation pattern is too high to compete with conventional reflector antennas. Compared with conventional reflector and lens antennas, reported research on microwave and millimetre-wave Fresnel zone antennas appears to be limited. In 1948, Maddaus published the design and experimental work on stepped half-wave lens antennas operating at 23 GHz and sidelobe levels of around -17dB were achieved. In 1961, Buskirk and Hendrix reported an experiment on simple circular <b>phase</b> <b>reversal</b> zoneplate reflector antennas for radio frequency operation. Unfortunately, the sidelobe they achieved was as high as -7dB. In 1987, Black and Wiltse published their theoretical and experimental work on the stepped quarter-wave zoneplate at 35 GHz. A sidelobe level of about -17dB was achieved. A year later a <b>phase</b> <b>reversal</b> zoneplate reflector operating at 94 GHz was reported by Huder and Menzel, and 25% efficiency and -19dB sidelobe level were obtained. An experiment on a similar antenna at 11.8 GHz was reported by NASA researchers in 1989. 5% 3dB bandwidth and -16dB sidelobe level were measured 1.|$|E
50|$|A humbucking pickup, {{shown in}} {{the image on the}} right, is {{composed}} of two coils. Each coil is wound reverse to one another. However, the six magnetic poles are opposite in polarity in each winding. Since ambient hum from power-supply transformers, radio frequencies, or electrical devices reaches the coils as common-mode noise, it induces an equal voltage in each coil. Because the windings are reversed in each pickup coil, the induced voltages cancel each other out. However, the signal from the guitar string is doubled, due to the <b>phase</b> <b>reversal</b> caused by the out of phase magnets. The magnets being out of phase in conjunction with the coil windings being out of phase put the guitar string signal from each pickup in phase with one another. Therefore, the voltage of the signal is approximately doubled, if the two coils are connected in series.|$|E

At the summer solstice, the <b>phase</b> <b>reversals</b> around midnight (caused by upward and downward FACs) and the terminator (caused by an FAC and a meridional current) may mix because the dawn and dusk terminators are located near midnight (∼ 1.6 and 22.4 h LT; see the red line in Fig. 12). Furthermore, the major axis of Pi 2 polarization is easily influenced by {{the location of the}} oscillating FACs when a station is located closer to the FACs.

40|$|Abstract. Under rapid {{periodic}} pacing, cardiac cells typically {{undergo a}} period-doubling bifurcation in which action potentials of {{short and long}} duration alternate with one another. If these action potentials propagate in a fiber, the short-long alternation may suffer <b>reversals</b> of <b>phase</b> at various points along the fiber, a phenomenon called (spatially) discordant alternans.

Using a weak approximation, Echebarria and Karma proposed an equation to describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of small-amplitude alternans {{in a class of}} simple cardiac models, and they showed that an instability in this equation predicts the spontaneous formation of discordant alternans. To study the bifurcation, they computed the spectrum of the relevant linearized operator numerically, supplemented with partial analytical results. In the present paper we calculate this spectrum with purely analytical methods in two cases where a small parameter may be exploited: (i) small dispersion or (ii) a long fiber. From this analysis we estimate the parameter ranges in which the <b>phase</b> <b>reversals</b> of discordant alternans are stationary or moving...|$|R
