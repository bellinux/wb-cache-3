50|$|Centrifugal casting is a {{metal casting}} {{technique}} {{that uses the}} forces of centripetal acceleration to distribute the molten material in the mold. Molten metal is typically fed into the mold using a spout. The process is then completed using rollers that rotate the mold about its axis causing the liquid metal to form to the mold and harden as the rotation continues. Rotation speeds and <b>pouring</b> <b>rates</b> are specific to the material being used and the design specifications.

The aim of this project {{was to try to}} try to address main problem areas through an {{alternate}} casting method (1 -tree casting) used for the manufacture of ASTM F- 75 cobalt chrome (Co-Cr) biomedical castings. The mould filling of various runner systems was assessed using real-time X-ray imaging and computational modelling.

40|$|In this paper, {{aluminium}} blank {{green sand}} (green) casting process was optimized by using Taguchi's robust design approach. An {{attempt was made}} to obtain optimal settings of two groups of aluminium blank sand casting processes. Single aluminium blank sand casting and double aluminium blanks sand casting for process robustness comparison. The casting process involves a number of parameters affecting various casting quality features of the product. In order to optimize the process seven control factors viz., grain size, clay content, moisture content, ramming, sprue size, riser size, and diameter to thickness (D/t) ratio of the blank were selected. Each factor was considered at three levels. For this study three uncontrollable (or noise) factors viz. metal flow <b>rate,</b> <b>pouring</b> temperature and humidity were identified. To capture the effect of noise factors casting yield, surface defects, and casting density for single and double castings were measured. An orthogonal array was constructed for the seven factors undertaken, and performing eighteen sets of experiments with their replicates generated the data. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio s were calculated based on the design of experiments. The average values of S/N ratios for each factor at three levels were calculated and were plotted on the graph. Considering the maximum S/N ratios from the graph, the optimum levels of process factors for both single and double castings were obtained. A statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to see which process parameters are statistically significant. A verification experiment was performed using the identified optimum conditions. The results have shown that single aluminium blanks and casting process is more robust than double aluminium blank sand casting process. This proved that single aluminium blank sand casting process had shown better insensitivity to noise factors.

40|$|High-level {{nuclear waste}} is being immobilized at the Savannah River Site (SRS) by {{vitrification}} into borosilicate glass at the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). Control of the Reduction/Oxidation (REDOX) equilibrium in the DWPF melter {{is critical for}} processing high level liquid wastes. Foaming, cold cap roll-overs, and off-gas surges all {{have an impact on}} <b>pouring</b> and melt <b>rate</b> during processing of high-level waste (HLW) glass. All of these phenomena can impact waste throughput and attainment in Joule heated melters such as the DWPF. These phenomena are caused by gas-glass disequilibrium when components in the melter feeds convert to glass and liberate gases such as H{sub 2 }O vapor (steam), CO{sub 2 }, O{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }, NO{sub x}, and/or N{sub 2 }. During the feed-to-glass conversion in the DWPF melter, multiple types of reactions occur in the cold cap and in the melt pool that release gaseous products. The various gaseous products can cause foaming at the melt pool surface. Foaming should be avoided as much as possible because an insulative layer of foam on the melt surface retards heat transfer to the cold cap and results in low melt rates. Uncontrolled foaming can also result in a blockage of critical melter or melter off-gas components. Foaming can also increase the potential for melter pressure surges, which would then make it difficult to maintain a constant pressure differential between the DWPF melter and the pour spout. Pressure surges can cause erratic pour streams and possible pluggage of the bellows as well. For these reasons, the DWPF uses a REDOX strategy and controls the melt REDOX between 0. 09 {le} Fe{sup 2 +}/{summation}Fe {le} 0. 33. Controlling the DWPF melter at an equilibrium of Fe{sup + 2 }/{summation}Fe {le} 0. 33 prevents metallic and sulfide rich species from forming nodules that can accumulate {{on the floor of the}} melter. Control of foaming, due to deoxygenation of manganic species, is achieved by converting oxidized MnO{sub 2 } or Mn{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } species to MnO during melter preprocessing. At the lower redox limit of Fe{sup + 2 }/{summation}Fe {approx} 0. 09 about 99 % of the Mn{sup + 4 }/Mn{sup + 3 } is converted to Mn{sup + 2 }. Therefore, the lower REDOX limits eliminates melter foaming from deoxygenation...|$|R
40|$|In several {{applications}} of casting, dendritic microstructure is not desirable as {{it results in}} poor mechanical properties. Enhancing fluid flow in the mushy zone by stirring {{is one of the}} means to suppress this dendritic growth. Strong fluid flow detaches the dendrites formed at the solid-liquid interface and carries them into the mould to form slurry. When this slurry solidifies, the microstructure is characterized by globular, non-dendritic primary phase particles, separated and enclosed by a near-eutectic lower-melting secondary phase. This property represents a great potential for further processing in semisolid forming (SSF) by various techniques such as pressure die casting and forging. Among all currently available methods, linear electromagnetic (EM) stirring is considered {{as one of the most}} suitable routes for large scale production of semisolid feed stock. One of the biggest advantages of EM stirring is that the stirring intensity and direction can be modulated externally and in a non-intrusive manner. With this viewpoint, the primary objective of the present research is to investigate rheocasting using linear electromagnetic stirring. A systematic development of a linear electromagnetic stirrer (LEMS) is the subject of the first part of the thesis. The LEMS consists of a set of six primary coils displaced in space. These coils are excited by a three-phase power supply to produce an axially travelling magnetic field. The metal to be stirred is placed in the annular space of the stirrer. The travelling field induces secondary current in the molten metal. The current and magnetic fields interact to generate a net mechanical force in the metal, commonly termed as the Lorentz force. The molten metal is stirred under the influence of this force. Two prototype stirrers, one for low melting alloys and the other for aluminium alloys are developed. The stirrers are characterized by measuring forces on low melting point alloy and on solid aluminum cylinders placed inside the annular space of the stirrer. As an outcome of these tests, a non-intrusive method of detecting stirring of liquid metal is developed. The development of a rheocasting mould for the LEMS forms the second part of the work presented in the thesis. The mould design and cooling arrangement are such that solidification in the mould is primarily unidirectional. Heat from the solidifying metal is extracted at the bottom of the mould, so that the axisymmetric EM stirring effectively shears the dendrites formed at the solid-liquid interface. The outer surface of the mould is cooled with water or air exiting from 64 jets, each of 4 mm diameter. Such an arrangement provides a high heat transfer coefficient and a wide range of cooling rate in the metal ranging from 0. 01 to 10 K/s. Temperature is measured at various depths in the solidifying melt and at other key locations in the mould to assess the various heat transfer mechanisms. The results from the rheocasting experiments using the above mould and LEMS are presented in the third and final part of the thesis. Such studies are required for understanding the solidification process in presence of electromagnetic stirring and for highlighting the important issues connecting solidification, fluid flow, dendrite fragmentation and the resulting microstructure. A series of experiments are performed with A 356 (Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg) alloy. Experiments are conducted with various combinations of operating parameters, and the resulting microstructures and cooling curves at various locations are examined. The key process parameters are stirring current, cooling <b>rate,</b> <b>pouring</b> temperature, and stirring current frequency. The parametric studies also include the case without EM stirring in which liquid aluminium is poured into the rheocast mould without powering the LEMS. It is found that stirring at high currents produces non-dendritic microstructures at all locations of the billet. For lower currents, however, dendritic microstructures are observed in regions outside the zone of active stirring. Stirring also enhances heat loss from the exposed top surface, leading to solid front advancement from the top as well. Without EM stirring, microstructures are found to be dendritic everywhere. The percentage of primary α-Al phase and its number density are found to increase with stirring intensity. With a decrease in cooling rate with air as the coolant, the average grain size of primary α-Al phase increases. Excitation frequency is found to be an important parameter, with lower frequencies generating a more uniform force field distribution, and higher frequencies enhancing induction heating. At higher frequencies, the effect of higher induction heating results in the formation of larger and coarser primary phase grains. This phenomenon has led to the development of a one-step process for rheocasting and heat treatment of billets...|$|R

In this study, a modest attempt has been made to find out the process parameters at which best mechanical properties of Al 6061, 4 %Cu and reinforced 5 % SiCp ceramic MMC can be obtained. Addition of 4 % Cu in Al 6061 is more or less comparable to the composition of duralumin, which is widely used in aerospace applications. SiCp is hard and having linear thermal expansion at high temperature. With reinforcement of SiCp in Al-Cu alloy, it can be postulated thathardness of MMC retains at high temperature applications. An analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for analysis of data with the help of SPSS (Version- 17. 0) software. Independent parameters are three levels of pouring rates (1. 5 cm/s, 2. 5 cm/s and 3. 5 cm/s), material type (Al 6061 + 4 %Cu alloy and Al+ 4 %Cu, reinforced 5 %SiCp MMC processed using stir casting technique) and dependent parameters are hardness and impact strength, which is found that at different pouring rates material hardness and impact strength are highly significant.

40|$|In the {{evaporative}} pattern casting process, casting defects occur {{depending on the}} properties of the foam pattern itself and the coating material. In particular, the permeability of the coat strongly affects product quality. However, there are some difficulties in improving casting defects caused by the permeability because there exists no appropriate evaluating method for hot permeability. We propose a new convenient method for the high precision measurement of coating permeability from room temperature to elevated temperature (hot permeability) using a suction type permeability tester. Remarkable difference in the hot permeability of the coat is found even if the room temperature permeability of coat is the same. Additionally the nature of hot permeability of the coat is classified into three types, they are decrement in permeability, constant, and increase from room temperature. Evaluation of castings based on the hot permeability data obtained by this method in the actual production site reveals a slight influence on the <b>pouring</b> <b>rate.</b> Measurement of the hot permeability of coating should therefore be useful for preventing casting defects...|$|E

Pressure changes in a gap developing between the pattern made of foamed polystyrene and the raising column of liquid alloy were determined. Studies were conducted pouring molds with cast iron and with AK 11 silumin.

In the present work, a previously developed steady-state, two-dimensional and multiphase CFD model was applied to perform parametric numerical experiments to investigate {{the effects of a}} number of parameters on the liquid film thickness at the disc edge, which included liquid mass feeding (<b>pouring)</b> <b>rate,</b> disc spinning speed, disc radius, liquid viscosity, density and surface tension. The modelling results were compared with experimental data and were found to be in good agreement. To reduce the number of simulations needed, Box and Behnken's fractional factorial design of numerical experiment was adopted. Furthermore, in order for the modelling results to be applicable to atomisation of different liquids using spinning discs of different sizes, a dimensionless correlation was developed based on dimensional analysis of the numerical simulation data. The modelling results indicate that the liquid film thickness can be significantly influenced by the disc radius and spinning speed, the liquid mass feeding rate, viscosity and density, whereas the liquid surface tension has a negligible effect...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMagnetodynamic tundish (MD-T) for {{continuous}} {{casting of steel}} had been developed in PTIMA NASU. Such aggregate has some features in contrast to conventional tundish and provides different-in-principle modes of work of continuous casting machines (CCM). There were carried out both physical and mathematical modeling continuous casting of steel from MD-T. In comparison with traditional technology, it was shown that reducing in 3. 0 - 3. 5 times of metal static pres-sure at pouring leads to decreasing in 1. 7 - 1. 8 times the depth of penetration of high-speed and high-temperature melt stream into solidifying ingot. In this case, for keeping (or rising) of mass <b>pouring</b> <b>rate</b> and ingot’s withdrawal rate, {{it is necessary to}} provide increasing of melt volume which incomes into CCM mold. Results of researches had indicated that MD-T can decide this problem. Electromagnetic systems of such aggregate allow to forming the flat stream of melt in width of 0. 5 - 0. 8 m. Such features of MD-T allow changing cardinally the terms of ingot forming. So, there is increased the heat load onto mold, {{but at the same time}} the heat load is decreased in the secondary cooling zone. Also, it is possi-ble to eliminate application of high-expensive electromagnetic systems for melt braking in the CCM mold. This fact creates preconditions for reduction of CCM length...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, metal matrix {{composites}} (MMCs) have emerged as an important class of materials for structural, wear, thermal, transportation and electrical applications. Metal matrix composites (MMCs) possess significantly improved properties including high specific strength; specific modulus, damping capacity and good wear resistance compared to unreinforced alloys. There are several techniques to produce composites, such as liquid state, solid state and semi-solid state production route. Among the entire liquid state production route stir casting route are simplest and cheapest. The aim of our project is to produce a composite with cheap and simple production route i. e. stir casting method. We have chosen 5 % SiC as the reinforcement material and balanced Al + 4 % Cu as matrix phase. In this thesis, the grit sizes of SiC have been changed 400, 600 and 800 mesh and tried to observe {{that the effect of}} grit sizes of SiC on mechanical properties with vary pouring temperatures 700, 725 and 750 °C. The best value of BHN, Impact and UTS has been obtained at optimum pouring temperature 725 °C. The <b>pouring</b> <b>rate</b> kept constant at 2. 5 cm/s for all composites. The mechanical properties as hardness, impact and tensile strength were enhanced with increasing grit size (400, 600 and 800 mesh) of reinforcement SiC particles. Using SPSS 17. 0...|$|E
40|$|In a {{long series}} of larger {{spreading}} tests with high temperature oxide melts (KATS tests) many parameters have been varied which are influencing the spreading behaviour (viscosity, <b>pouring</b> <b>rate,</b> substratum of spreading surface, presence of water). In spite of an extensive instrumentation using different thermocouples, an infrared camera and several video cameras, only in very few cases the behaviour of the melt front at the very moment of immobilization could be detected in detail. Therefore in the additional miniKATS series five small scale (5 kg) spreading tests with oxide melts have been conducted to investigate the mechanical properties of the spreading front in the moment of immobilization. It turned out that in all cases the bulk of the melt at this moment was still liquid at a temperature close to the initial one. Depending on the initial melt properties two distinct phenomena have been observed which control the immobilization of the melt: the first phenomena is the crust formation at the surface, the crusts at the bottom combined with the crust at the surface of the melt. In the other case the whole melt front was still above the liquid temperature at the moment of immobilization. Here the surface tension was controlling the spreading, it was in balance with the driving gravitational force. In none of the test bulk freezing has been detected. (orig.)
