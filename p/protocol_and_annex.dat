50|$|The Treaty of Establishment, Commerce and Navigation (or the Treaty of Establishment, Commerce and Navigation with Full <b>Protocols</b> <b>and</b> <b>Annex)</b> {{was signed}} on August 25, 1935, between representatives of Iran and the Soviet Union. This accord helped to {{reinforce}} the tenets of the Russo-Persian Treaty of Friendship. Based on {{the terms of the}} treaty, both signatories reinforced their respective rights to fly their national flags on their respective commercial vessels. Moreover, both signatories were allowed to fish in the Caspian Sea within ten nautical miles (19 km) of the coastline.|$|R
50|$|There are 37 <b>protocols,</b> 2 <b>annexes</b> <b>and</b> 65 {{declarations}} {{that are}} attached to the treaties to elaborate details, often in connection with a single country, without being in the full legal text.|$|R
40|$|The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty <b>and</b> its <b>annexes</b> {{contribute}} substantially {{to contemporary}} international law prohibiting marine pollution. As the Protocol approaches obtaining {{the number of}} ratifications necessary for entry into force, its relevance for international ocean law accordingly becomes more salient. Thus, measures in the <b>Protocol</b> <b>and</b> its <b>annexes</b> take on particular importance, as they are made to apply to all sources of pollution affecting the Southern Ocean ecosystem (i. e., sources from land, dumping, vessels, the atmosphere and the seabed). Such an all-encompassing approach well serves to bolster both the normative and policy framework for effecting anti-pollution marine law in the region. ...|$|R
40|$|Cook Islands {{deposited}} their {{instrument of}} ratification at the same occasion. Of the five countries that did not sign only Vanuatu {{said that it would}} not sign the Treaty at all. Papua New Guinea (who later in the year signed), indicated that due to constitutional requirements, it could not do so at the time. Nauru, Tonga and Solomon Islands were also of the same view. The Treaty requires that eight members ratify it for it to become registered with the United Nations. The Treaty which contains sixteen articles, three <b>protocols</b> <b>and</b> four <b>annexes,</b> commits signatories to prohibit the storing, testing and dumping of nuclear wastes in the parties land and ocean jurisdiction. The Treaty further requires the signatories to renounce nuclear warfare and forbids assisting such warfare. But members can decide independently whether to allow foreign nuclear ships and warplanes to use their harbours and airports...|$|R
50|$|In 1958, Afghanistan {{ratified}} the Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials, with Annexes A to E <b>and</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>annexed</b> (Florence, 17 June 1950). In 1979, it accepted the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (Paris, 14 November 1970) and in 2005 it {{ratified the}} Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (Paris, 16 November 1972). It acceded to the WIPO treaty on 13 September 2005, which came into {{action at the}} end of the year.|$|R
30|$|LTE-A {{specification}} considers UE localization {{through the}} LTE positioning <b>protocol</b> (LPP) <b>and</b> LPP <b>annex</b> (LPPa) [34 – 36]. Several different positioning methods are {{mentioned in the}} standard, namely: observed time difference of arrival (OTDoA), assisted-Global navigation Satellite system (A-GNSS) and enhanced-cell ID (E-CID). Implementation details are omitted here but the interested reader can refer to the standard for further information. All of these positioning methods are based on measurements collected by the UE or the eNodeB. The mobility management entity (MME) is the entity that receives the request for the localization of a UE from another entity such as another UE, eNodeB or other nodes. Then, the MME sends a location service request to the enhanced serving mobile location centre (E-SMLC), which will execute the positioning procedure through LPP <b>and</b> LPPa <b>protocols.</b> The SLs interface defined between E-SMLC and MME serves as a tunnel for the E-SMLC to transparently carry LPP <b>and</b> LPPa <b>protocols</b> through the MME, in addition to transport the Location Services Application <b>Protocol</b> (LCS-AP) messages <b>and</b> parameters.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, several {{provinces of}} the Kingdom of Yugoslavia {{corresponding}} to the modern-day state of Serbia were occupied by the Axis Powers from 1941 to 1944. Most of the area was occupied by the Wehrmacht and was organized as separate territory under control of the German Military Administration in Serbia. Other parts of modern Serbia that {{were not included in}} the German-administered territory were occupied <b>and</b> <b>annexed</b> by neighboring Axis countries: Syrmia was occupied <b>and</b> <b>annexed</b> by the Independent State of Croatia, Bačka was occupied <b>and</b> <b>annexed</b> by Hungary, southeastern Serbia was occupied <b>and</b> <b>annexed</b> by Bulgaria, <b>and</b> southwestern Serbia was occupied <b>and</b> <b>annexed</b> by Italy <b>and</b> included in the Italian protectorates of Albania and Montenegro.|$|R
30|$|User {{positioning}} {{can significantly}} reduce {{the complexity of the}} relay selection process. LTE-A specification considers MN localization through the LTE Positioning <b>Protocol</b> (LPP) <b>and</b> LPP <b>Annex</b> (LPPa) [15, 16]. Several different positioning methods are mentioned in the standard, namely: Observed Time Difference of Arrival (OTDoA), Assisted-Global Navigation Satellite System (A-GNSS) and Enhanced-Cell ID (E-CID). Implementation details are omitted here but the interested reader can refer to the standard for further information. All of these positioning methods are based on measurements collected by the MN or the BS. The Mobility Management Entity (MME) is the entity that receives the request for the localization of a MN from another entity such as a MN, BS or other nodes. Then, the MME sends a location service request to the Enhanced Serving Mobile Location Centre (E-SMLC), which will execute the positioning procedure through LPP <b>and</b> LPPa <b>protocols.</b> The SLs interface defined between E-SMLC and MME serves as a tunnel for the E-SMLC to transparently carry LPP <b>and</b> LPPa <b>protocols</b> through the MME, in addition to transport the Location Services Application <b>Protocol</b> (LCS-AP) messages <b>and</b> parameters. The study of different positioning methods is outside the scope of this article. However, {{it is worth noting that}} in LTE-A advanced location methods are available and can be used by the relay selection mechanism proposed in this article.|$|R
