It is {{increasingly}} used as Web and application servers, software development platforms, personal workstations, and research machines. In computer science and engineering departments, you’ll find Linux systems in classrooms, programming labs, and computer centers, not just because Linux is free, but also because it offers a rich computing environment for teaching and learning. From its beginning in 1991, and with help from the GNU Project, Linux has evolved quickly and has brought new <b>powers</b> <b>and</b> <b>conveniences</b> to users. Competency on Linux will be important for any serious computer professional. This book provides a comprehensive and up-to-date guide to Linux concepts, usage, and programming. The text helps you master Linux with a wellselected set of topics. Hands-on practice is encouraged; it is the only way to gain familiarity with an operating system. A primer gets you started quickly. The chapters lead you from user interfaces, commands and filters, Shell scripting, the file system, networking, to kernel system calls. There are many example...|$|R

50|$|The revolutionary {{new model}} Nance hoped for was delayed until 1955, {{partially}} because of Packard's merger with Studebaker. Packard stylist Richard A. Teague was called upon by Nance {{to design the}} 1955 line, and to Teague's credit, the 1955 Packard was indeed a sensation when it appeared. Not only was the body completely updated and modernized, but the suspension also was totally new, with torsion bars front and rear, along with an electric control that kept the car level regardless of load or road conditions. Crowning this stunning new design was Packard's brand new ultra-modern overhead-valve V8, displacing 352 cid L, replacing the old, heavy, cast-iron side-valve straight-eight {{that had been used}} for decades. In addition, Packard offered a variety of <b>power,</b> comfort, <b>and</b> <b>convenience</b> features, such as <b>power</b> steering <b>and</b> brakes as well as electric window lifts. But air conditioning was an anomaly. Although available on all makes by the mid-fifties, it was installed on only a handful of cars in 1955 and 1956 despite Packard's status as a luxury car. Model year sales only climbed back to 55,000 units in 1955, including Clipper, in what was a very strong year across the industry.|$|R
40|$|Automated {{border control}} gates {{are now being}} more and more {{deployed}} at airports to smooth border crossings with reduced man <b>power</b> <b>and</b> more <b>convenience</b> to the passenger. In order to use these new gates the traveler is required to present an electronic passport (e-Passport or biometric passport).

However, the weakest point in the passport issuance process is the enrolment step for passport applicant including the breeder documents authenticity and the duplicate enrolment check. The goal of duplicate enrolment check is to prevent the issuance of duplicate illegal passports containing possibly fake identities. A solution to this problem needs to be flexible and precise if the solution is meant for large-scale deployments and eventually standardization.

40|$|Investigator-initiated trials, some {{of which}} have been {{referred}} to as comparative effectiveness trials, pragmatic trials, or strategy trials, are sometimes considered to be of greater clinical importance than industry-driven trials, because they address important but unresolved clinical questions that differ from the questions asked in industry-driven trials. Regulatory authorities have provided methodological guidance for industry-driven trials for the approval of new treatments, but such guidance is less clear for investigator-initiated trials. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) task force for the update of the recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis has critically looked at the methodological quality and conduct of many investigator-initiated trials, and has identified a number of concerns. In this Viewpoint paper, we highlight commonly encountered issues that are discussed using examples of well-known investigator-initiated trials.

40|$|Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) {{have become}} a rapidly {{expanding}} global market, because they combine the benefits of high fuel economy and low emissions with the <b>power,</b> range, <b>and</b> <b>convenience</b> of gasoline <b>and</b> diesel <b>powered</b> vehicles. The HEV drivetrain {{is a combination of}} the internal combustion engine of a conventional vehicle with the battery and electric motor of an electric vehicle. Future HEV's can incorporate two energy sources - an energy conversion unit such as an internal combustion engine or fuel cell and an energy storage device such as batteries or ultracapacitors [1].

50|$|Examples of CoL-based applied {{theories}} are {{the so called}} clarithmetics. These are number theories based on CoL {{in the same sense}} as Peano arithmetic PA is based on classical logic. Such a system is usually a conservative extension of PA. It typically includes all Peano axioms, and adds to them one or two extra-Peano axioms such as &#8851;x&#8852;y(y=x) expressing the computability of the successor function. Typically it also has one or two non-logical rules of inference, such as constructive versions of induction or comprehension. Through routine variations in such rules one can obtain sound and complete systems characterizing one or another interactive computational complexity class C. This is in the sense that a problem belongs to C if and only if it has a proof in the theory. So, such a theory can be used for finding not merely algorithmic solutions, but also efficient ones on demand, such as solutions that run in polynomial time or logarithmic space. It {{should be pointed out that}} all claritmetical theories share the same logical postulates, and only their non-logical postulates vary depending on the target complexity class. Their notable distinguishing feature from other approaches with similar aspirations (such as bounded arithmetic) is that they extend rather than weaken PA, preserving the full deductive <b>power</b> <b>and</b> <b>convenience</b> of the latter.|$|E

40|$|A {{low power}} UV spectroabsorptiometer has been {{developed}} to measure the concentration of dissolved nitrate in seawater, in situ, with a rapid 1 Hz response. Measurements {{at a number of}} wavelengths in the region of 220 nm determine the concentrations of dissolved nitrate, sea salt and, possibly, dissolved organics, whilst a third channel at 300 nm acts as a reference channel to correct for light intensity changes related to lamp output and scattering by particles in seawater. This paper describes the first prototype UV nitrate sensor designed to evaluate and compare options for the light source, spectral filter and detector. The choice of components was based on a compromise between performance, cost, <b>power</b> consumption <b>and</b> <b>convenience</b> of use. The eventual instrument uses a xenon flashlamp light source, fused silica windows and lenses, a sample cavity, a grating spectrometer and UV enhanced silicon photodiode detectors. The power consumption of the sensor was typically from 3 to 4 W, depending on the selected repetition rate of the flashlamp source. Initial laboratory trials have shown the sensor to be unresponsive to changes in pressure allowing for continuous use to depths of up to 5000 m. Initial responses to changes in temperature have been eliminated by the adjustment of the sensor's <b>power</b> supply <b>and</b> lamp flash rate. Calibration of the sensor has been performed under laboratory conditions and resulted in a second order linear fit (r^ 2 > 0. 99, p 0. 21 µmol/l N 03.

These demonstrated the capability of the instrument to precisely determine nitrate concentrations in seawater...|$|R

It is difficult to build these services because they must support enormous loads (e. g., millions of users) without appreciable downtime over very long periods of time (e. g., years). Further, loads can have large peaks, and, unlike traditional large scale computing problems, the performance of these services are not described by their overall runtime but rather by their response time to individual user requests.
