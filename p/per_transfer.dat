25|$|DDR3-xxx denotes data {{transfer}} rate, and describes DDR chips, whereas PC3-xxxx denotes theoretical bandwidth (with {{the last two}} digits truncated), and is used to describe assembled DIMMs. Bandwidth is calculated by taking transfers per second and multiplying by eight. This is because DDR3 memory modules transfer data on a bus that is 64 data bits wide, and since a byte comprises 8 bits, this equates to 8 bytes of data <b>per</b> <b>transfer.</b>|$|E
25|$|Embryos who {{reach the}} day 3 cell stage {{can be tested}} for {{chromosomal}} or specific genetic defects prior to possible transfer by preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Transferring at the blastocyst stage confers {{a significant increase in}} live birth rate <b>per</b> <b>transfer,</b> but also confers a decreased number of embryos available for transfer and embryo cryopreservation, so the cumulative clinical pregnancy rates are increased with cleavage stage transfer. Transfer day 2 instead of day 3 after fertilization has no differences in live birth rate.|$|E
25|$|Below is {{an example}} of bit-banging the SPI {{protocol}} as an SPI master with CPOL=0, CPHA=0, and eight bits <b>per</b> <b>transfer.</b> The example is written in the C programming language. Because this is CPOL=0 the clock must be pulled low before the chip select is activated. The chip select line must be activated, which normally means being toggled low, for the peripheral {{before the start of the}} transfer, and then deactivated afterward. Most peripherals allow or require several transfers while the select line is low; this routine might be called several times before deselecting the chip.|$|E

40|$|Beam cutting {{ejection}} permits filling of the LEP {{by several}} batch transfers of 8 positron bunches. The charge <b>per</b> <b>transferred</b> bunch is thereby kept low, thus reducing {{the possibility of}} instabilities in the injector chain.

5000|$|Maximum {{throughput}} scheduling is {{a procedure}} for scheduling data packets in a packet-switched best-effort communications network, typically a wireless network, in view {{to maximize the}} total throughput of the network, or the system spectral efficiency in a wireless network. This is achieved by giving scheduling priority to the least [...] "expensive" [...] data flows in terms of consumed network resources <b>per</b> <b>transferred</b> amount of information.|$|R
25|$|The EIB is {{presently}} implemented as a circular ring consisting of four 16 bytes wide unidirectional channels which counter-rotate in pairs. When traffic patterns permit, each channel can convey {{up to three}} transactions concurrently. As the EIB runs at half the system clock rate the effective channel rate is 16 bytes every two system clocks. At maximum concurrency, with three active transactions {{on each of the}} four rings, the peak instantaneous EIB bandwidth is 96 bytes per clock (12 concurrent transactions * 16 bytes wide / 2 system clocks <b>per</b> <b>transfer).</b> While this figure is often quoted in IBM literature it is unrealistic to simply scale this number by processor clock speed. The arbitration unit imposes additional constraints which are discussed in the Bandwidth Assessment section below.|$|E

5000|$|If {{the cost}} of each user is known, in terms of {{consumed}} resources <b>per</b> <b>transferred</b> information bit, the FSSE measure may be redefined to reflect proportional fairness. In a proportional fair system, this [...] "proportionally fair shared spectrum efficiency" [...] (or [...] "fairly shared radio resource cost") is maximized. This policy is less fair since [...] "expensive" [...] users are given lower throughput than others, but still scheduling starvation is avoided.|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} way {{to design a}} clocked electronic circuit {{is to make it}} perform one transfer per full cycle (rise and fall) of a clock signal. This, however, requires that the clock signal changes twice <b>per</b> <b>transfer,</b> while the data lines change at most once <b>per</b> <b>transfer.</b> When operating at a high bandwidth, signal integrity limitations constrain the clock frequency. By using both edges of the clock, the data signals operate with the same limiting frequency, thereby doubling the data transmission rate.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} questions put forward by patients after the failure of a fertility therapy such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is related to the lack of success. The implantation rate <b>per</b> <b>transferred</b> embryo normally does not exceed 30 %. Often the failure of “embryo implantation” is given as an explanation as the failure in one {{of the most}} critical stages at the beginning of conception, i.e. when apposition and implantation has to occur inside the uterine cavity. Current knowledge about the mechanism of these interactions is still difficult to interpret [1].|$|R
