5|$|In a <b>panoramic</b> camera, the {{focal-plane shutter}} was {{replaced}} by a rotation of 180° of the lens itself. This model was the basis for the Doppel-Sport <b>Panoramic</b> Camera, which Neubronner tried to market around 1910. It captured a <b>panoramic</b> view on 3cm×8cm film. It never went into serial production, though.|$|E
5|$|Intimidator {{features}} eight drops, seven camelback hills, a <b>panoramic</b> u-turn, and {{a diving}} spiral. One cycle lasts about 3 minutes and 33 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The ramparts of {{the fort}} give <b>panoramic</b> views of the town.|$|E
5|$|Despite these issues, {{the lake}} {{remains one of}} Utah's largest tourist attractions. Antelope Island State Park is a popular tourist {{destination}} that offers <b>panoramic</b> views of the lake, hiking and biking trails, wildlife viewing and access to beaches.|$|E
5|$|Gas Works Park {{features}} the preserved superstructure of a coal gasification plant closed in 1956. Located across Lake Union from downtown, the park provides <b>panoramic</b> {{views of the}} Seattle skyline.|$|E
5|$|Her early {{style is}} less {{individual}} and more realistic or primitive, despite {{her lack of}} knowledge of, or perhaps rejection of, basic perspective. Initially she created simple compositions or copied existing images. As her career advanced she created complicated, <b>panoramic</b> compositions of rural life.|$|E
5|$|Lower Man. The {{mountain}} has two tops, {{which used}} to be distinguished as Helvellyn Low Man (or Lower Man) and Helvellyn High Man (or Higher Man). Both are drawn and labelled on a <b>panoramic</b> view of the range found in Jonathan Otley's guidebook of 1823.|$|E
5|$|Route44 {{gradually}} descends {{into the}} upper Harlem Valley, with a sharp hairpin turn providing a <b>panoramic</b> view to the south. A gradual descent takes it into downtown Amenia. At the center of town, the highway turns north and replaces NY343 as NY22's overlap.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's first <b>panoramic</b> landscape, View of Naarden {{with the}} Church at Muiderberg in the Distance, dates from 1647. The theme of an {{overwhelming}} sky and a distant town, {{in this case}} the birthplace of his father, is one he returned to in his later years.|$|E
5|$|The Kolob Terrace area, west of Zion Canyon {{features}} The Subway, a slot canyon hike, and Lava Point, with a <b>panoramic</b> view of {{the entire}} area. The Kolob Canyons section, further west near Cedar City, features the world's second longest arch, Kolob Arch.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} had {{a circular}} pathway to the summit. The top offered a <b>panoramic</b> view {{of each of}} the existing sections. Strollers were not permitted. The walk-way was permanently closed in 1984 so that Vortex could be built.|$|E
5|$|Before joining NASA, Glenn was a {{distinguished}} fighter pilot in World War II, China and Korea. He shot down three MiG-15 aircraft, and was awarded six Distinguished Flying Crosses and eighteen Air Medals. In 1957, {{he made the}} first supersonic transcontinental flight across the United States. His on-board camera took the first continuous, <b>panoramic</b> photograph of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Club Autus {{has also}} {{introduced}} the Royole Moon™ 3D virtual mobile theatre {{with the world}} first scalable 800-inch curved screen design, for 3D movies and video games. The scenery zone can overlook the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and the <b>panoramic</b> views of airport apron at sunset, through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the in-door balcony of the lounge.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned by the {{organizers}} of the fair, Bartolo Pasin and Rogelio Chimenti, it was designed by Miguel De Lisi and constructed in two months by local bricklayer Aldo Cardozo. Presently it is used as an overlook for its <b>panoramic</b> view. The monument {{is considered to be a}} symbol of the town, and as such it is depicted in the coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Haifa {{is home to}} two internationally {{acclaimed}} {{universities and}} several colleges The University of Haifa, founded in 1963, {{is at the top}} of Mt. Carmel. The campus was designed by the architect of Brasília and United Nations Headquarters in New York City, Oscar Niemeyer. The top floor of the 30-story Eshkol Tower provides a <b>panoramic</b> view of northern Israel. The Hecht Museum, with important archeology and art collections, is on the campus of Haifa University.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 Neubronner {{found that}} {{ten years of}} hard work and {{considerable}} expenses had been rewarded only with his inclusion in encyclopedias and the satisfaction that an ancillary technology, the mobile dovecote (described below), had proved its worth in the war. Neubronner's <b>panoramic</b> camera is displayed at the German Museum of Technology in Berlin and the Deutsches Museum in Munich.|$|E
5|$|In {{a couple}} of Lexus firsts, the {{fifth-generation}} LS is the first Lexus sedan to feature a six-sided window design, while the flush-surface windows integrate smoothly with the pillars. In the company’s efforts to reconcile two conflicting goals, sufficient headroom with a low roofline, the new LS employs an available outer-slide-type <b>panoramic</b> moonroof instead of the conventional, internally retracting item.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{is located on}} the northern hill of the town, which has an elevation of 70 to 80 metres (230 to 260 feet). The hill is mostly covered in bushes and can be accessed by two paths. Currently it is used as an overlook for its <b>panoramic</b> view of the town. It also serves to mark the finishing line for the annual trekking trail competition, Desafío al Indio Comahue.|$|E
5|$|The synagogue {{building}} {{can be seen}} in the 1956 film Singing in the Dark, starring Oysher, {{and also}} starring (and produced by) Joey Adams. The entrance {{can be seen in}} the <b>panoramic</b> photograph of the corner of Ludlow and Rivington streets found on the Beastie Boys' 1989 Paul's Boutique album cover foldout, and the building (and Jacob Spiegel) can also be seen in Raphael Nadjari's 2001 film I Am Josh Polonski's Brother.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} home to a museum {{collection}} displaying furniture originally made for the tower, alongside paintings, prints and objects illustrating William Beckford’s life as a writer, collector and patron of the arts. Visitors can climb the spiral staircase to the restored belvedere below the lantern and experience <b>panoramic</b> views of the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|The town of Mammoth Lakes, {{located near}} the {{southern}} end of the chain and Mammoth Mountain, is the largest populated area nearby. Mammoth Mountain Ski Area is located nearby and gondola rides can be taken year-round (weather permitting) to the mountain's summit. The summit of Mammoth Mountain provides <b>panoramic</b> views of the craters and domes of the Mono–Inyo volcanic chain, Mono Lake, the Sierra Nevada and Long Valley Caldera.|$|E
5|$|The work {{purchased}} by the Luxembourg in 1925 was In Australia, a portrait of Ned Wright, manager of the property at Delegate where she had stayed in the early 1920s. He is portrayed on horseback, a pipe clasped in his exposed and bright teeth, with a <b>panoramic</b> backdrop of an Australian pastoral landscape. His stance is casual, self-assured and heroic, consistent with the up-beat nationalism of Australia at the time.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{urbanisation}} of Gateshead {{around it}} has detracted from the <b>panoramic</b> views of western Gateshead {{that were once}} enjoyed by residents, at elevated positions views of Lobley Hill, Team Valley and Dunston Hill can be glimpsed. Although now a suburb of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, the openness and greenspace prevalent in Low Fell means that the suburb continues to enjoy a rural feel, which is an unusual trait in the modern Gatshead conurbation.|$|E
5|$|Various <b>panoramic</b> {{views of}} the Haarlem skyline and its {{bleaching}} grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands {{of light and shadow}} towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo's Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.|$|E
5|$|While Amsterdam does {{feature in}} his work, {{it does so}} {{relatively}} rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years. It does feature in his only known architectural subject, a drawing of {{the interior of the}} Old Church, as well as in views of the Dam, and the <b>Panoramic</b> view of the Amstel looking toward Amsterdam, one of Ruisdael's last paintings.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1937, {{there was}} an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine gun {{in the rear of the}} turret and an {{anti-aircraft}} machine gun on top of it, as well as the addition of two searchlights above the gun for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun telescopic sight. Ammunition stowage for the main gun was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with radio set, had a PTK commander's <b>panoramic</b> sight.|$|E
5|$|From {{the top of}} Mount Austin at , <b>panoramic</b> {{views of}} the north coastal plains, Savo and Florida islands, and the battlefields of World War II can be seen. The Japanese had held this hilltop {{in the second half}} of 1942 and showered {{artillery}} fire on American troops at the Henderson airfield below the hill. Eventually the hill was captured but the Japanese held on to the Gifu, Sea Horse, and Galloping Horse ridges for about a month. Most of the Japanese died of starvation, banzai assaults or direct killing.|$|E
5|$|General Tuan Shi-wen died in 1980, and {{was buried}} in a pagoda-like tomb on a hilltop reached via a 300-metre (984ft) climb. From the top, there is a <b>panoramic</b> view of the village. There is also a {{memorial}} to the KMT soldiers who died in their fight against communism, The Martyrs' Memorial, a museum whose wooden panels bear {{the names of the}} dead, set on an altar in the main building. It was constructed in the style of a large Chinese shrine like the National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine in Taipei. The museum also features exhibits describing the struggles of the KMT soldiers and the development of the Doi Mae Salong valley.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Atlanta {{ranked among}} the fifty largest cities in the United States. The {{battlefield}} is now urban, residential, and commercial land, with many markers memorializing notable events of the battle, including McPherson's place of death. The marker was erected in 1956 by the Georgia Historical Commission. To commemorate the 140th anniversary of the battle, in 2004, two new markers were erected in the Inman Park neighborhood. The Atlanta Cyclorama building, built in 1921 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is a museum located in Grant Park containing a <b>panoramic</b> painting of the battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{a working}} {{replica of the}} SSEM, now {{on display at the}} Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, was built to {{celebrate}} the 50th anniversary of the running of its first program. Demonstrations of the machine in operation are held regularly at the museum. In 2008, an original <b>panoramic</b> photograph of the entire machine was discovered at the University of Manchester. The photograph, taken on 15 December 1948 by a research student, Alec Robinson, had been reproduced in The Illustrated London News in June 1949.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little technical {{information is available}} about lenses, shutters and {{the speed of the}} photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his <b>panoramic</b> camera from ADOX. For this camera he estimated a film speed of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a shutter speed of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the order made by the Luftwaffe, the German Navy's Marineflieger also received 112 of the IDS variant in the anti-shipping and marine reconnaissance roles, again replacing the Starfighter. These equipped two wings, each with a nominal strength of 48 aircraft. The principal anti-ship weapon was the AS.34 Kormoran anti-ship missile, which were initially supplemented by unguided bombs and BL755 cluster munitions, and later by AGM-88 HARM anti-radar missiles. Pods fitted with <b>panoramic</b> optical cameras and an infrared line scan were carried for the reconnaissance mission.|$|E
5|$|Jean, who had adapted and {{directed}} Hogfather in 2006, was keen {{to return to}} some of the locations used in that film to provide continuity. The scenes in the Great hall of the Unseen University were filmed in the crypt of the Guildhall in the City of London, and the same Victorian country home was used for Death's house as had been seen in Hogfather. This time around, Jean was able to film more extensive <b>panoramic</b> shots in the latter location, thanks to The Colour of Magic's larger budget. Other filming locations included Anglesey and Snowdonia for exterior shots, Gloucester docks as the docks of Ankh-Morpork, and the Royal Courts of Justice as the Patrician's Palace.|$|E
5|$|Once {{out of the}} village, NY17A and NY94 {{begin to}} climb again, this time {{offering}} some <b>panoramic</b> views to the north, {{all the way to}} the Shawangunk Ridge and even the Catskill Mountains beyond them in clear enough weather. The road is surprisingly little developed in this area, with only one gas station between Florida and Warwick, its next stop, which likewise presents itself after a descent. Again, NY17A and NY94 serve as the bustling village's main street, longer this time and with many upscale boutiques in evidence. Many historic buildings line the road through Warwick. Near the southern end of the village, the two roads split, with NY94 continuing toward New Jersey while NY17A goes eastward.|$|E
5|$|Positioned at the {{national}} grid reference 35960865, Hampton Down Stone Circle {{is located on the}} southern edge of an open downland ridge at a height of 680 feet above sea level. Located 1 kilometre (0.6 miles) north-west of Portesham on private land, it is positioned on the rim of Portesham Hill and overlooks the coast. Had the vegetation levels been low {{at the time of the}} circle's creation then it would have permitted extensive <b>panoramic</b> views of the coastline. The site is a scheduled monument, and thus accorded legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.|$|E
5|$|So far {{during this}} period, Leeds has seen much development, {{particularly}} in the city centre, most notably the highrise developments such as Bridgewater Place, the developments around Clarence Dock, K2 (albeit a conversion from an older building) {{as well as many}} developments incorporating student accommodation. The 2002 redevelopment of Leeds railway station incorporated a notable steel and glass roof covering the main platform hall and providing <b>panoramic</b> views to the south west from the mezzanine level.|$|E
