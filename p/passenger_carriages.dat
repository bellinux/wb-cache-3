5|$|Unlike the loaned {{locomotives}} and <b>passenger</b> <b>carriages,</b> the LNC owned its dedicated hearse vans outright. Despite this, {{they were}} always painted in whichever colour scheme was currently in use by the LSWR (SR after 1923), to match the livery of the passenger cars and locomotives loaned to the LNC.|$|E
5|$|The <b>passenger</b> <b>{{carriages}}</b> {{used on the}} London Necropolis Railway {{were not}} owned by the LNC, but loaned from the LSWR. A set of carriages was permanently loaned, rather than carriages being lent as needed, as the LSWR was concerned that passengers might be discouraged from using regular LSWR services if they knew that their carriages had potentially carried dead bodies recently.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 two new <b>passenger</b> <b>carriages,</b> each {{accommodating}} 40 passengers, {{were bought}} by the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company from the Bristol Wagon & Carriage Works {{as part of the}} programme of improvements in anticipation of the extension to Oxford. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O an eight-wheeled 70seat passenger carriage. Following the takeover of the O by the MR, goods services were operated by a fleet of five eight-wheeled carriages built in 1865–66. Two cattle wagons were added to the line's stock in the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|The {{company had}} five Di 3 diesel locomotives, {{and a single}} El 13 {{electric}} locomotive. Ofotbanen had 22 B3 <b>passenger</b> <b>carriages,</b> used for charter trains. These were supplemented by three two-car Class 68 electric multiple units. The 48 freight cars the company used were owned by Nord-Norsk Spedisjon. Of these, 19 were timber cars. All stock was painted dark green. All motorized stock was used stock that NSB has chosen to take out of service.|$|E
5|$|Early <b>passenger</b> <b>carriages</b> were {{of similar}} design {{to those used}} on {{railways}} in England at the time, holding eighteen passengers on first class carriages, and thirty on second class. Third class carriages originally had seats, but on 15 April 1840 a board decision declared that all future third class carriages were to be made without seats. All existing third class carriages also had their seats removed. A later board decision on 3 July 1840 ordered that third class carriages would be situated closest to the engine, followed by second class, with first class at the rear.|$|E
5|$|The Kingswood branch was not {{included}} in the rebuilding, and retained its original 1871 track. Two Manning Wardle locomotives, Huddersfield and Earl Temple, came into use on the line at around this time. Huddersfield had been built in 1876 and originally named Prestwich; Earl Temple was identical to Huddersfield other than having a covered cab. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad could not afford the price when Earl Temple was delivered and the Earl bought it with his own money and rented it to the O In 1895 two new <b>passenger</b> <b>carriages,</b> each accommodating 40 passengers, were bought from the Bristol Wagon and Carriage Company. In 1896 Huddersfield was withdrawn, and in 1899 replaced with a new Manning Wardle locomotive named Wotton No.2, at which time Earl Temple was renamed Brill No.1.|$|E

5|$|The hasty {{departure}} from Manchester degenerated into chaos. Mechanical failures {{and a lack}} of space to turn the locomotives meant that the seven trains on the northern track were unable {{to get out of the}} station. Only three carriages—the Duke's among them—managed to leave successfully. At around 6.30pm the Duke arrived in Roby, and went to spend the night at the Marquess of Salisbury's house at Childwall Hall. Meanwhile, the remaining 24 <b>passenger</b> <b>carriages</b> were eventually lashed together with rope and fastened to the three locomotives which remained usable, which hauled this single long train, carrying around 600 passengers, out of Manchester at a speed of around 5mph (8km/h), further slowed by crowds of people standing on the tracks and by grit and mud settling on the rails.|$|E
5|$|With through running {{between the}} lines in place, in June 1899 the MR {{inspected}} the O's carriages and locomotives, and had serious concerns. The original passenger carriage began as a horse tram and was shabby internally, and unsafe {{as part of a}} longer train. The passenger carriage from the 1870s was in a poor condition. The 1895 Bristol <b>passenger</b> <b>carriages</b> were unfit owing to their light construction. Eight of the O's nine goods wagons did not comply with Railway Clearing House standards and could not be used on other lines. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O an eight-wheeled 70seat passenger carriage. As this had been built for the MR's standard height platforms rather than the O's low platforms, 80–100ft (24–30m) of each platform on the Tramway was raised to standard height to accommodate the MR carriage.|$|E
5|$|The railway opened {{short of}} rolling stock as {{only half of}} the twelve {{locomotives}} and twenty-four of forty <b>passenger</b> <b>carriages</b> ordered had arrived. The carriage builders, Brown, Marshall & Co of Birmingham, stated that based on their experience they had expected the line to open at least two months late. The third day after opening to passengers, on 23 September, there was a collision between two trains at Kittybrewster that resulted in the death of a passenger and several serious injuries. The inquiry found that the driver, attempting to make up time after a late start, had over-run previous stations and been approaching the terminus with excessive speed. The driver attempted to select reverse gear to slow the train but had failed {{to hold on to the}} lever, which slipped into forward, propelling the train into carriages waiting at the platform. The report also criticised the station staff, who should not have allowed the carriages to be waiting at the station. The layout at Kittybrewster was altered after the accident.|$|E
