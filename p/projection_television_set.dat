40|$|US 2005063171 A UPAB: 20050527 NOVELTY - The module has an LED or an LED {{array of}} base color with a beam path {{oriented}} {{in a direction}} of a display unit. The LEDs or LED arrays of other base colors are attached such that beam paths of the latter colors are laterally input in a sequence under input angles (alpha, beta) of less than ninety degrees into the beam path of the former base color. The input angles of the two input base colors are equal and comprise 75 degrees. USE - Used in a data or video projector and a rear <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> <b>set.</b> ADVANTAGE - The input angles of the two input base colors are equal, and hence optimal light efficiencies at {{the output of the}} illumination module is achieved with these angles. The arrangement of the LEDs minimizes the size of the module...|$|E

50|$|Digital Light Processing (DLP) {{is a type}} {{of video}} {{projector}} technology that uses a digital micromirror device. Some DLPs have a TV tuner, which makes them a type of TV display. It was originally developed in 1987 by Dr. Larry Hornbeck of Texas Instruments. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997. Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy Awards in 1998 for invention of the DLP projector technology. DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses. DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), but also in private homes; in these cases, the image is projected onto a projection screen. DLP is also used in DLP rear <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> <b>sets</b> and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection.|$|R

5000|$|Very few <b>television</b> <b>sets</b> perform true I and Q {{decoding}}, due to {{the high}} costs of such an implementation. Compared to the cheaper R-Y and B-Y decoding which requires only one filter, I and Q each requires a different filter to satisfy the bandwidth differences between I and Q. These bandwidth differences also requires that the 'I' filter include a time delay to match the longer delay of the 'Q' filter. The Rockwell Modular Digital Radio (MDR) was one I and Q decoding set, which in 1997 could operate in frame-at-a-time mode with a PC or in realtime with the Fast IQ Processor (FIQP). Some RCA [...] "Colortrak" [...] home TV receivers made circa 1985 not only used I/Q decoding, but also advertised its benefits along with its comb filtering benefits as full [...] "100 percent processing" [...] to deliver more of the original color picture content. Earlier, more than one brand of color TV (RCA, Arvin) used I/Q decoding in the 1954 or 1955 model year on models utilizing screens about 13 inches (measured diagonally). The original Advent <b>projection</b> <b>television</b> used I/Q decoding. Around 1990, at least one manufacturer (Ikegami) of professional studio picture monitors advertised I/Q decoding.|$|R
