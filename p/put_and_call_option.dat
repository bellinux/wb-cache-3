40|$|This paper applies options {{theory to}} the model of {{equilibrium}} credit rationing developed by [Stiglitz, J. E., Weiss, A., 1981. Credit rationing in markets with imperfect information, American Economic Review, 71, 727 – 752. ] by noticing that, given a standard debt contract and limited liability, the payoffs to the lender and the borrower when a loan is made involve a <b>put</b> <b>and</b> <b>call</b> <b>option</b> respectively. Information asymmetry is modelled using stochastic volatility option pricing methods. There are three advantages to the options approach. First, the well-known comparative statics of option pricing provide an alternative and immediate proof for many of Stiglitz and Weiss' results. Secondly, the framework accommodates several theoretical extensions to the basic results. Finally, the approach allows {{an assessment of the}} empirical significance of equilibrium credit rationing, since the model is easily parameterised. Simulations of the model suggest that rationing is unlikely to be significant at the collateral levels observed in the U. S and U. K. small commercial loan market...|$|E
40|$|The revenue risk is {{of great}} {{importance}} to ensure {{the success of a}} real toll public–private partnership (PPP) transportation project. Past research has proposed a revenue guarantee put option as an alternative way to quantify and potentially manage this risk. A practical, or commercial, limitation of this type of option is its requirement for an upfront premium payment, and a concessionaire is likely to shy away from additional monetary requirements. A collar option, which is a combination of a <b>put</b> <b>and</b> <b>call</b> <b>option,</b> not only overcomes this barrier but it also provides other benefits. Modifications to the basic collar’s structure can redistribute downside losses and upside profits to fulfil stakeholders’ needs and thus improve the effectiveness of risk management. The terms, applicability and limitations of a collar option are discussed, and a numerical example is developed to illustrate how to determine the strike prices of a collar option.

40|$|We study {{numerical}} {{solutions to}} discrete time control problems under partial observation {{when the state}} of the system is described by (X, Y, V α) with X signal process, Y observation process and V α controlled process. The control processes α is required to be adapted with respect to the observation filtration. The structure of the control problem is motivated with a view towards financial applications. In particular we consider the problem of hedging a future liability in the context of incomplete information. To cope with difficulties arising from partial information, stochastic filtering is used and the filter process is discretized in order to obtain a feasible numerical solution. This is done by performing a quantization of the pair process filter-observation. Dynamic programming is finally applied to solve the approximated filtered control problem. Convergence results are given and numerical applications are presented and discussed for the problem of hedging an European <b>put</b> (<b>and</b> <b>call)</b> <b>option</b> with unobservable volatility...|$|E

30|$|This study {{forwards}} a {{model that}} values the strategies to lend or to idle a loan portfolio in a system where business practices produce asymmetric information, and income volatility. Determining the loan portfolio option value of a Philippine Universal Bank that results from managerial flexibility, {{in an environment of}} volatility and imperfect information, is the first objective of this paper. The importance of determining the option value for a loan portfolio is that this information guides investment policy, as to the level of expansion a loan portfolio may undertake, or the amount necessary to hedge downside risks from idling or lending. As such, these option values provide insight with regard to the future value of strategies and resources in Capital Budgeting and Rationing decisions. Unlike much of the extant Real Options literature, this paper will discuss both the <b>put</b> <b>and</b> <b>call</b> <b>option</b> values Philippine Universal Banks face. This follows the methodology and concepts of Real Options Valuation by Bellalah (2001); Dixit (1989 a, 1989 b, 1992); McDonald and Siegel (1986); Pindyck (1988); Tsai (2008); and van Putten and MacMillan (2004).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} bid-ask spreads in the Australian Options Market before and after it switched from a quote-driven floor-traded market to an orderdriven screen-traded market. Employing three-stage regression analysis, this study reports that both <b>put</b> <b>and</b> <b>call</b> <b>option</b> bid- ask spreads are positively related {{to the value of}} the option and negatively related to the level of trading activity. Bid-ask spreads in the AOM are also positively related to the option's term-to-maturity, which may reflect the previously documented negative relationship between term- to- maturity and the level of trading in the option. Evidence of a positive relationship between an option's hedge ratio, measured in absolute terms, and its bid-ask spread is consistent with both theory and previous empirical results. With regards to the impact of the changes in market microstructure upon bid-ask spreads, the paper reports that spreads are generally less when market makers are obliged to maintain continuous quotes in the Central Orderbook. The paper also reports that the shift from a quote-driven floor-traded market to an orderdriven electronically-traded market was associated with an increase in the spreads of options written on the shares of seven of the nine companies examined...|$|E

40|$|The paper further develops, {{both from}} the {{theoretical}} and numerical points of view the analytical valuation of the American options, initiated by Geske and Johnson (1984) for the American put with no dividend. We present and prove closed form formulas {{for the value of}} the Bermudan put and call, with dividend, paid continuously at a constant rate, where a general number and not necessarily equal length intervals subdivide the time. Based on the obtained formulas and recent, efficient numerical integration techniques, to obtain values of the multivariate normal c. d. f., the Bermudan <b>put</b> <b>and</b> <b>call</b> <b>option</b> values are calculated for up to twenty subdividing intervals. The sequences of option values are smoothed by sums of exponential functions and the latters are used to predict the values of the American options. Numerical results are presented and compared with those, published in the literature. It is shown that the binomial method systematically overestimates the option price, and, according to our numerical results, so do many other methods.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} option trading activity and stock market volatility. Although the option market is uniquely suited for trading on volatility information, there is little analysis on how trading activity in this market is linked to stock price volatility. The bulk of the discussion tends to focus on whether trading activity {{in the stock market}} is informative about stock volatility. To analyze the information in option trading activity for stock market volatility, a sample of 15 stocks with the highest option trading volume is selected. For each stock, it is noted that the trading activities in the <b>put</b> <b>and</b> <b>call</b> <b>option</b> markets have significant explanatory power for stock market volatility. In addition, the results indicate that the call option trading activity has a stronger impact on stock volatility compared with that of the put options. Our results demonstrate that information and sentiment in the option market is useful for the estimation of stock market volatility. Also, the significance of the effects of option trading activity on stock price volatility is observed to be comparable to that of stock market trading activity. Furthermore, the persistence and asymmetric effects in the volatility of some stocks tend to disappear once option trading activity is taken into account...|$|E
