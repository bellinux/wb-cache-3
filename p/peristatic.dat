40|$|AbstractThe basic {{feature of}} the peridynamic model {{considered}} is a continuum description of a material behavior as the integrated nonlocal force interactions between infinitesimal particles. In contrast to these classical theories, the peridynamic equation of motion introduced by Silling (2000) is free of any spatial derivatives of displacement. A heterogeneous bar of statistically homogeneous random structure of constituents with the <b>peristatic</b> mechanical properties is analyzed by the standard averaging tool of micromechanics. The applicability of local elasticity theory is demonstrated for description of effective elastic behavior of this bar. The approach proposed is based on numerical solution (for both the displacements and <b>peristatic</b> stresses) for one heterogeneity inside infinite homogeneous bar loaded {{by a pair of}} self-equilibrated concentrated remote forces. This solution is substituted into the general scheme of micromechanics of locally elastic media adapted for the considered case of 1 D <b>peristatic</b> structures. A convergence of effective modulus estimations is demonstrated for both the <b>peristatic</b> composite bar and locally elastic bar...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPeridynamics is a nonlocal {{theory of}} {{continuum}} mechanics, which {{was developed by}} Silling (2000). Since then peridynamics {{has been applied to}} a variety of solid mechanics problems ranging from fracture, damage, failure to wave propagation, buckling, and detonation physics. Since the governing equation of peridynamics is an integro-differential equation, most of the treatment in the literature is often numerical. However, the analytical treatment is very important {{for the development of the}} peridynamic theory, which is continually developing at the present time. In this paper, <b>peristatic</b> and peridynamic problems for a 1 D infinite rod are analytically investigated. We have developed a method to obtain a valid analytical solution starting from a formal analytical solution, which may be divergent. The primary contribution of the present paper is a systematic analytical treatment of <b>peristatic</b> and peridynamic problems for a 1 D infinite rod. Additionally, dispersion curves and group velocities for the materials with three different micromoduli are also studied. It is found from the study that some peridynamic materials can have negative group velocities in certain regions of wavenumber. This indicates that peridynamics can be used for modeling certain types of dispersive media with anomalous dispersion such as the one discussed by Mobley (2007) ...|$|E

40|$|In this context, a new {{statistical}} {{theory is}} proposed {{that takes into}} account the coupling between grain size, shape and crystallographic texture using probability functions. The probability function developed in this work, termed "grain size orientation distribution function" (GSODF). The prediction of texture and strains achieved by the statistical approach is verified by comparing against the CPFE approach. The approach is found to be two orders of magnitude faster than CPFE, which allows larger metallic components simulation. Then, a concurrent multiscaling model is pursued with fine meshes are employed to resolve the individual crystals crystals in micro-scale regions where critical features such as stress concentrations dominate. At larger size meshes other than the critical region, statistical theories are employed to approximate the microstructure in terms of probability functions (Orientation density function (ODF)). The concurrent approach is significantly faster than current algorithms for multiscale analysis of localization and failure. The prediction of the concurrent multiscale model is verified with analytical elastic solutions for a wedge-opening load (WOL) specimen. The model is then enriched using the variational multiscale cohesive method for modeling aspects of crack propagation in polycrystalline alloys. Numerical results including mesh convergence, and crack paths for tensile and three point bending experiments are shown. Intergranular and transgranular cracks are successfully simulated with exceptional convergence and efficiency. The final section of this thesis explores the application of an emerging simulation technique, peridynamics, for modeling discontinuities in polycrystalline microstructures. A quasi{static implementation of the theory is developed. Results are compared with crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) analysis for the problem of plane strain compression of a planar polycrystal. The stress, strain field distribution and the texture formation predicted by CPFE and peridynamis are found to compare well. One promising feature of <b>peristatics</b> is its ability to model fine shear bands that occur naturally in deforming polycrystalline aggregates. Simulations are used to study the origin and evolution of these shear bands as a function of strain and slip geometry. In the future, combination of peridynamics with statistical descriptors is anticipated for efficient modeling of failure at the macroscale...|$|R

40|$|The {{factors which}} seem to {{influence}} or turn on the allergic response in children can be prenatal, perinatal and postnatal. In prenatals heredity takes the first place but environmental factors contribute as well as genetk ones. Of prenatal <b>peristatic</b> (environmental) factors highly allergenic food in allergic mothers and progesterone therapy may be important in turning on the allergic process in potentially allergic infants. The mother's progesterone therapy during pregnancy was shown to increase significantly the mean IgE levels and the mean percentage of detectable IgE in the cord blood. This hormone {{has been reported to}} be immuno-suppressive in vitro. As 20 -alpha-hydroxy- steroid dehydrogenase was discovered in the mouse thymus, the hypothesis has been put forward that this enzyme, engaged in the progesterone metabolism, may have a protective role in reducing progesterone activity in the thymocytes. Thus, the progesterone administered to pregnant women might interact with fetal thymus maturation imd because a delayed thymic maturation was involved in th~ allergy onset, a hypothetical role of progesterone may be explained. According to another hypothesis progesterone may modify the placental biology including a placental transfer of IgE. N/...|$|E
30|$|Ten milliliters of Au NPs (3.44  ×  1012 particles/mL) were washed with Milli-Q water (18.2  MΩ) by {{repeated}} centrifugation at 10, 000  rpm for 30  min {{and then}} re-dispersed in Milli-Q water (18.2  MΩ). After the 2 times wash steps, Au NPs were re-dispersed in 10  mL of 0.02  M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.73). Using a <b>peristatic</b> pump, ten milliliters of Au NPs (3.4  ×  1012 particles/mL) in sodium bicarbonate buffer were steadily added at 7  μL/s to 2  μL of 20  mM SPDP solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (4.73  ×  10 − 20 mol SPDP per Au NP) while {{the solution was}} stirred vigorously on ice. The reaction was left stirring at room temperature overnight. Unreacted SPDP was removed by centrifugation twice at 10, 000  rpm for 30  min, and SPDP-activated Au NPs were re-dispersed in 10  mL of 0.02  M sodium bicarbonate buffer and briefly sonicated in a sonication bath for 30  s [39]. When exposed to dithiothreitol (DTT), SPDP cleaves; this concept was used to quantify SPDP conjugation. SPDP conjugation of Au NPs was quantified by {{the release of a}} pyridine- 2 -thione group when incubated with dithiothreitol (DTT). Briefly, 1.5  mL of SPDP-activated Au NP solution (3.4  ×  1012  particles/mL) was washed twice with DI water by repeated centrifugation at 10, 000  rpm for 30  min and re-dispersion. Seventy-five microliters of 15  mg/mL DTT in DI water were added to 0.75  mL of SPDP-Au NP solution, followed by incubation for 15  min at room temperature. The released amount of pyridine- 2 -thione was quantified by the absorbance at 343  nm using a Varian Cary 50 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). After subtracting the background absorbance of a DTT-free SPDP-Au NP solution at the same concentration, SPDP-conjugation was calculated to be 5.34  ×  10 − 22  mol (=  321 mol) of SPDP per Au NP. The resulting SPDP-activated Au NPs were kept at 4  °C without exposure to light.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} record the uterine {{movement}} of a rabbit {{over a long period}} of time, under as physiological a condition as possible and by a simple procedure and to observe the mode of propagation of uterine contraction from such a record, a method of detaining double balloons in the uterus was devised. The balloons were made of raw rubber, the centers of two balloons being apart at a distance of 3 cm and were withheld inside the uterine cavity, near the Fallopian tube. Changes in the water pressure inside the balloons produced by the myometrial activity were recorded kymographically under conscious state on desired occations. Of the 57 rabbits submitted to this operation, 24 remained unharmed and were able to be used for the experiments over 6 weeks. Majority of the casualties could have been prevented by taking a little more precaution. The uterine movement curve was recorded best when the water pressure inside the balloon was 25 cm. The shape of the curves was variable, and could be classified by wave height, frequency of the waves, wave form, and rhythm. Comparatively rhythmical curves would enable prediction of the direction of <b>peristatic</b> movement from the time deviation of contraction waves transmitted by the two balloons. The height of uterine movement curves of rabbits varied from day to day but its maximum was found to come in intervals of 13 - 26 days in five rabbits. In the does known to be in heat from copulating tendencies, the wave height was generally great or there were some grouping of contraction waves. On the contrary, the waye height was small in those not in heat. It may be considered, therefore, that the periodicity in wave height described above indicates the oestrus cycle. The wave height lessened somewhat three hours after the copulation, became extremely slight 48 hours later, and the uterine movement practically stopped for over 14 days until the start of the next movement. However, frequency of uterine contraction rather increased during 12 hours following the copulation. The mode of propagation of uterine contraction as judged by the time deviation in the contraction of the two balloons was generally complicated and the march of the movement in only one direction over a long period was a rare occurrence. It may be said, however, that the direction of the wave march is generally definite when the wave height was great and in the majority of such cases this is from the tubal side to the vaginal...|$|E
