All goods were put up in compact packages of about one hundred pounds each, suitable for loading on pack mules. Two of these packages made a load for an ordinary Mexican mule, and three for the larger ones. The bulk of the trade was in leaf tobacco, and domestic cotton-cloths and calicoes. The Mexicans had, before the arrival of the army, but little to offer in exchange except silver. The trade in tobacco was enormous, considering the population to be supplied.

Methodology of {{estimation}} {{the friction}} coefficient is discussed relative to asymmetrical rolling for powders using rollers of different diameters that rotate with similar angle velocities.

The method of forward slip, the method of measurement of friction coefficient via the diagram of radial pressure upon the roll, and the method of roller-pin testing on standard friction machines are validated as useful for application to conditions of asymmetrical rolling on rollers of various diameters that rotate with similar angle velocities. A hypothetical curve of the friction coefficient variation at <b>powder</b> <b>rolling</b> is suggested that accounted {{for the presence of}} slipping friction and friction at rest.

Effects of blending elements having different powder sizes on densification properties were analyzed. The strip thickness was proportional to the roll gap up to 0. 9 mm and the density of titanium strip was decreased with the increase in roll gap. As the roll speed increased, the strip density and thickness were decreased by using - 200 mesh Ti powder.

This hardening of composites after the precursor rolling occurs due to blocking of dislocation motions by the grains’ boundaries, as well owing to a uniform distribution of the components over the material’s volume.

An SUS 316 L and a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy powders {{are treated}} by Mechanical Milling (MM) process, {{which is one}} of SPD processes, and then {{sintered}} by Hot Roll Sintering (HRS) process. The HRS process consolidates <b>powder</b> by hot <b>rolling</b> of an evacuated metal pipe filled with the powder at elevated temperatures. Those MM powders have a heavy deformed microstructure at the surface region and have a work hardened microstructure in the core region of the powder. In the surface region, a nano grain structure forms after the MM treatment in both materials. In case of the SUS 316 L powder, such a nano grain structure consists of an equiaxed nano ferrite (c) grains which has transformed from nano austenite (i) grains. Volume fraction of the c phase decreases with distance from the surface of powder. During HRS the (c + i) nano-duplex structure changes to (sigma (u) + i) nano-duplex structure by transformation of the c to the u phase. Thus, the SUS 316 L HRS material consists of a hybrid structure. That is, a (u + i) nano-duplex structure at the powder shell region, and a work hardened i structure in the powder core region. In case of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V MM powder, though no remarkable transformation occurs, a heavy deformed shell and work hardened core hybrid structure is also produced in the powder.
