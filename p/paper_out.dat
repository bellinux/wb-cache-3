5|$|When Wilkes {{returned}} from California to New York City, {{he began to}} work for William T. Porter at Porter's newspaper The Spirit of the Times. Porter sold the paper in 1856 to Wilkes, who retained Porter on the newspaper's staff until Porter's death in 1858. Wilkes, however, renamed the paper to Porter's Spirit of the Times, a title it retained until 1859. In September 1859, Abraham C. Dayton, who had previously worked for the Spirit, left the paper and because he had purchased {{a share of the}} paper at one point from Porter, began publishing a paper he called Porter's Spirit of the Times. Dayton got a court order preventing Wilkes from using Porter's name, so Wilkes changed the name of his paper to Wilkes' Spirit of the Times, while Dayton continued to publish Porter's Spirit of the Times. Dayton was only able to publish until August 1861, however, as Wilkes drove the other <b>paper</b> <b>out</b> of business. Wilkes owned the surviving paper until his death in 1885.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{publishing}} one of {{its most}} famous discoveries, Watson and Crick's 1953 [...] on the structure of DNA, Nature did not send the <b>paper</b> <b>out</b> for peer review. John Maddox, Natures editor, stated: [...] "the Watson and Crick paper was not peer-reviewed by Nature ... the paper could not have been refereed: its correctness is self-evident. No referee working in the field ... could have kept his mouth shut once he saw the structure".|$|E

2500|$|The scarab has {{at least}} one power it can {{manifest}} whether dormant or active; it can give Jaime a peculiar form of [...] "sight" [...] to perceive extra-dimensional objects, which gather information on the scarab user's adversaries. The scarab is able to communicate with him in a more comprehensible fashion if need be. The scarab's language slowly morphs into a format resembling English, claiming Khaji Da as its own name and Jaime as its first real friend. However, it has occasional language relapses. The suit is capable of compensating for Jaime's digestive system, so that he does not need to expel waste materials when using the suit, and can even make <b>paper</b> <b>out</b> of dead skin cells the suit collects.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his call}} for a boycott on June 2, 1925, Du Bois pursued his {{challenge}} to Fisk and McKenzie through his editorials in The Crisis, the official magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and in Black newspapers across the country. In the fall of 1924, Du Bois embarked upon a lecture tour speaking to Fisk alumni clubs throughout the nation. He also contacted Fisk students, faculty, and alumni {{as part of an}} effort to collect evidence and examples of a paternalistic and authoritarian Fisk administration in sympathy with White Southern interests. [...] Soon Du Bois targeted McKenzie. In late 1924, Du Bois wrote of McKenzie's appointment as President in The Crisis: [...] "I knew him. I called him friend. I saw in him a new type of young, scientific philanthropist come to help and re-establish training among Negroes." [...] In early 1925, Du Bois resurrected the Fisk Herald, the former Fisk student newspaper. As a former editor of the Herald in the 1880s, Du Bois had a special affection for the newspaper. For many Fisk alumni, the Fisk Herald was an important symbol of literary freedom. Du Bois published the <b>paper</b> <b>out</b> of his office in New York City, and proclaimed in the inaugural issue, [...] "Unless McKenzie is removed from Fisk, I intend to publish every word of evidence I hold to prove he is unfit and a detriment to the cause of higher education for our race." ...|$|E
