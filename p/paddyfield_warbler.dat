5000|$|The Manchurian {{reed warbler}} (Acrocephalus tangorum), {{also known as}} the Manchurian reed-warbler, is a species of marsh-warbler (family Acrocephalidae). It was {{formerly}} included in the [...] "Old World warbler" [...] assemblage, and was usually (and sometimes is still) treated as a subspecies of the <b>paddyfield</b> <b>warbler</b> (A. agricola). It is found in Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Laos, Russia, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and possibly Myanmar. Its natural habitat is swamps. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|About 266 {{species of}} birds {{can be seen in}} the park, {{including}} migrants. Endemic birds include the Malabar grey hornbill, Nilgiri wood pigeon, blue-winged parakeet, Nilgiri flycatcher, crimson-backed sunbird, and white-bellied blue flycatcher. Other birds include the black baza, spot-bellied eagle-owl, Nilgiri thrush, little spiderhunter, rufous-bellied hawk-eagle, brahminy kite, great hornbill, Sri Lanka frogmouth, Oriental darter, and black-necked stork.A four-day survey was conducted on December 1-4, 2016, organised under the aegis of the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) and found the presence of 13 new bird and 16 butterfly species that were undetected earlier. The newly found bird species included Eurasian Woodcock (Scolopax rusticola), Steppe Gull (Larus fuscus barbensis), Grey-necked Bunting (Emberiza bruniceps) and <b>Paddyfield</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Acrocephalus agricola).|$|E
50|$|The {{freshwater}} Lake Durankulak {{is separated}} from the Black Sea by sand dunes and a beach strip, it has an area of around 4 square kilometres and features two islands in its western part, the Big Island (0.02 km2) and the Small Island (0.0053 km2). As the habitat of 260 rare and endangered species, the lake {{is one of the}} most important and well-preserved coastal wetlands in Bulgaria. Among the important birds in the area are the little bittern, ferruginous duck, mute swan, western marsh harrier, <b>paddyfield</b> <b>warbler.</b> The greater white-fronted goose, red-breasted goose and mallard spend the winter there, and there are large populations of the pygmy cormorant and great white pelican.|$|E
50|$|Nanjizel {{is within}} the Porthgwarra to Pordenack Point Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), {{designated}} in 1977 for its granite cliffs and maritime heath. The valley is a constant effort site (CES) for the West Cornwall Ringing Group which monitors the birds in the valley. Breeding birds include common chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita), common whitethroat (Sylvia communis), dunnock (Prunella modularis), Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), Eurasian wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) and sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus). Other birds found include brambling (Fringilla montifringilla), cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus), common grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia), Eurasian siskin (Spinus spinus) lesser redpoll (Acanthis cabaret) and subalpine warbler (Sylvia cantillans). Rareties ringed {{in the autumn of}} 2014 were aquatic warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola), barred warbler (Sylvia nisoria) and <b>paddyfield</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus agricola). A first for Britain occurred on 8 October 2008 with the trapping, and the measuring of biometric data, of an alder flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum). A first for Cornwall occurred on 2 September 2015, when a Blyth's reed warbler (Acrocephalus dumetorum) was ringed. There have been six Isles of Scilly records and one from Devon so it was considered long overdue for Cornwall.|$|E
40|$|Population genetic {{structure}} was studied in paddyfield warblers Acrocephalus agricola breeding in NE Bulgaria, SE Russia and S Kazakhstan. We were {{particularly interested in}} the degree of genetic differentiation and gene flow of the Bulgarian population due to its geographical isolation, recent origin and unique migratory strategy. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) showed that there was no divergence between Bulgarian and Russian populations (FST = 0. 007), whereas those in Kazakhstan differed significantly from the European breeding populations (Russia: FST = 0. 058; Bulgaria: FST = 0. 114). The degree of differentiation between populations at nuclear markers (five microsatellite loci; FST ≈ 0) was weaker than for mtDNA. We suggest that this relatively weak differentiation over the range of this species reflects a recent postglacial expansion, and results from mismatch distribution analyses and Fu’s FS tests are in agreement. Preservation of small and geographically isolated populations which may contain individuals with unique adaptive traits, such as the studied Bulgarian population of <b>paddyfield</b> <b>warbler,</b> is valuable for the long-term conservation of expanding migratory bird species [Current Zoology 57 (1) : 63 – 71, 2011]...|$|E
40|$|The <b>paddyfield</b> <b>warbler,</b> Acrocephalus agricola, has {{extended}} its breeding range from Central Asia {{to the western}} Black Sea coast. The Balkan population offers a unique chance to test the effect of breeding range expansion on the genetically programmed migratory direction. We studied 21 paddyfield warblers at Durankulak Lake, NE Bulgaria, by recording their autumn migratory orientation in circular orientation cages. Our data show that the preferred migratory orientation is directed along a NE-SW axis. Paddyfield warblers seem to avoid direct crossing of the Black Sea by following the western coast. The mean bearing was parallel to the nearest coastline and corresponds to {{the direction of the}} historical breeding range expansion of the species. In our experiment many individuals showed south-western orientation in autumn, a course which would potentially lead the birds to exploratory movements outside the current breeding range. An axial orientation response has been often shown in circular cage tests, and can be due to factors such as coastal orientation or reverse orientation triggered by the physiological condition of some individuals. However, it might also be one of the driving mechanisms for range expansion. Hence, we can expect the future expansion of Balkan paddyfield warblers to continue towards south-west.
