40|$|PURPOSE: We {{performed}} a phase I trial of <b>piroxantrone</b> {{with and without}} granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) {{to determine whether the}} use of this cytokine would enable us to increase the dose-intensity of <b>piroxantrone.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients received 121 courses of <b>piroxantrone</b> administered once every 21 days. Initial patient cohorts received <b>piroxantrone</b> alone starting at 150 mg/m 2 and the dose was escalated in subsequent patients until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was reached. Patient cohorts then received escalating doses of <b>piroxantrone</b> starting at 185 mg/m 2 administered with G-CSF beginning day 2. RESULTS: Dose-limiting neutropenia occurred in three of six patients treated with 185 mg/m 2 piroxantrone; the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of <b>piroxantrone</b> alone was 150 mg/m 2. Three of six patients treated with <b>piroxantrone</b> and G-CSF exhibited dose-limiting thrombocytopenia at 445 mg/m 2; the MTD of <b>piroxantrone</b> with G-CSF was thus 355 mg/m 2. Seven patients developed symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) at cumulative <b>piroxantrone</b> doses ranging from 855 to 2, 475 mg/m 2 and two have died of cardiotoxicity. Of these patients, six of seven had previously received doxorubicin. Other nonhematologic toxicity was mild. CONCLUSION: The use of G-CSF results in a more than twofold increase in the MTD of <b>piroxantrone.</b> However, symptomatic cardiotoxicity is prominent, especially in patients who have received prior treatment with anthracyclines...|$|E
40|$|The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) {{studied the}} {{response}} rate and toxicity of <b>piroxantrone</b> (150 mg/m 2 q 21 days) in patients with advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Among 32 eligible patients, there were no partial nor complete responses. There were two mixed responses. Significant white cell toxicity, anemia, nausea, and vomiting were observed. Mild or moderate degrees of fever, malaise, and stomatitis occurred. No significant cardiac toxicity was noted. <b>Piroxantrone</b> does not have significant activity as a single agent in advanced renal cell carcinoma...|$|E
