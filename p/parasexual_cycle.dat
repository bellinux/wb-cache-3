50|$|The <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> resembles sexual reproduction. In both cases, unlike hyphae (or {{modifications}} thereof) may fuse (plasmogamy) {{and their}} nuclei will occupy the same cell. The unlike nuclei fuse (karyogamy) {{to form a}} diploid (zygote) nucleus. In contrast to the sexual cycle, in the <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> recombination takes place during mitosis followed by haploidization (but without meiosis). The recombined haploid nuclei appear among vegetative cells, which differ genetically {{from those of the}} parent mycelium.|$|E
50|$|Parasexuality {{refers to}} the process of heterokaryosis, caused by merging of two hyphae {{belonging}} to different individuals, by a process called anastomosis, followed by a series of events resulting in genetically different cell nuclei in the mycelium.The merging of nuclei is not followed by meiotic events, such as gamete formation and results in an increased number of chromosomes per nuclei. Mitotic crossover may enable recombination, i.e., an exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. The chromosome number may then be restored to its haploid state by nuclear division, with each daughter nuclei being genetically different from the original parent nuclei. Alternatively, nuclei may lose some chromosomes, resulting in aneuploid cells. Candida albicans (class Saccharomycetes) {{is an example of a}} fungus that has a <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> (see Candida albicans and <b>Parasexual</b> <b>cycle).</b>|$|E

Fungicide resistance development not only forms a useful model for the study of adaptation, but also is of great practical importance (Chapter 1). In this thesis, the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans was used as model organism. Chapter 1 describes how its well-developed genetics can be exploited in laboratory studies (Clutterbuck 1974; Pontecorvo et al. 1953).

40|$|We review here recent {{advances}} {{in our understanding of}} sexual reproduction in fungal pathogens that commonly infect humans, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Where appropriate or relevant, we introduce findings on other species associated with human infections. In particular, we focus on rapid advances involving genetic, genomic, and population genetic approaches that have reshaped our view of how fungal pathogens evolve. Rather than being asexual, mitotic, and largely clonal, as was thought to be prevalent as recently as a decade ago, we now appreciate {{that the vast majority of}} pathogenic fungi have retained extant sexual, or <b>parasexual,</b> <b>cycles.</b> In some examples, sexual and parasexual unions of pathogenic fungi involve closely related individuals, generating diversity in the population but with more restricted recombination than expected from fertile, sexual, outcrossing and recombining populations. In other cases, species and isolates participate in global outcrossing populations with the capacity for considerable levels of gene flow. These findings illustrate general principles of eukaryotic pathogen emergence with relevance for other fungi, parasitic eukaryotic pathogens, and both unicellular and multicellular eukaryotic organisms...|$|R
40|$|Secondary metabolism, usually {{superfluous}} under laboratory conditions, {{is intrinsically}} elusive to genetic analysis of its regulation. We describe here {{a method of}} analyzing regulatory mutations affecting expression of secondary metabolic genes, with an Aspergillus nidulans penicillin structural gene (ipnA [encoding isopenicillin N-synthase]) as a model. The method {{is based on a}} targeted double integration of a lacZ fusion reporter gene in a chromosome different from that containing the penicillin gene cluster. The trans-acting regulatory mutations simultaneously affect lacZ expression and penicillin biosynthesis. One of these mutations (npeE 1) has been analyzed in detail. This mutation is recessive, prevents penicillin production and ipnA'::'lacZ expression, and results in very low levels of the ipnA message at certain times of growth. This indicates that npeE positively controls ipnA transcription. We also show that this tandem reporter fusion allows genetic analysis of npeE 1 by using the sexual and <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycles</b> and that lacZ expression is an easily scorable phenotype. Haploidization analysis established that npeE is located in chromosome IV, but npeE 1 does not show meiotic linkage to a number of known chromosome IV markers. This method might be of general applicability to genetic analysis of regulation of other fungal secondary metabolic pathways...|$|R
50|$|Both {{heterokaryosis}} and the <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> {{are very}} important for those fungi that have no sexual reproduction. Those cycles provide for somatic variation in the vegetative phase of their life cycles. This is also true for fungi where the sexual phase is present, although in this case, additional and significant variation is incorporated through the sexual reproduction.|$|E
50|$|The <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle,</b> {{a process}} {{peculiar}} to fungi and single-celled organisms, is a nonsexual mechanism of parasexuality for transferring genetic material without meiosis or {{the development of}} sexual structures. It was first described by Italian geneticist Guido Pontecorvo in 1956 during studies on Aspergillus nidulans (also called Emericella nidulans when referring to its sexual form, or teleomorph). A <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> is initiated by the fusion of hyphae (anastomosis) during which nuclei and other cytoplasmic components occupy the same cell (heterokaryosis and plasmogamy). Fusion of the unlike nuclei in the cell of the heterokaryon results in formation of a diploid nucleus (karyogamy), which {{is believed to be}} unstable and can produce segregants by recombination involving mitotic crossing-over and haploidization. Mitotic crossing-over can lead to the exchange of genes on chromosomes; while haploidization probably involves mitotic nondisjunctions which randomly reassort the chromosomes and result in the production of aneuploid and haploid cells. Like a sexual cycle, parasexuality gives the species the opportunity to recombine the genome and produce new genotypes in their offspring. Unlike a sexual cycle, the process lacks coordination and is exclusively mitotic.|$|E
50|$|Candida albicans is a diploid fungus {{that grows}} {{both as a}} yeast and as a filament. C. albicans {{is the most common}} fungal {{pathogen}} in humans. It causes both debilitating mucosal infections and potentially life-threatening systemic infections. C. albicans has maintained an elaborate, but largely hidden, mating apparatus. Johnson suggested that mating strategies may allow C. albicans to survive in the hostile environment of a mammalian host. In order to mate C. albicans needs to switch from white to opaque cells. The latter are more efficient in mating and referred to as the mating competent cells of C. albicans. Mating in C. albicans is termed a <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> since meiosis is still not observed in C. albicans.|$|E
40|$|The {{opportunistic}} pathogen Candida albicans {{undergoes a}} <b>parasexual</b> mating <b>cycle</b> in which cells must switch from the conventional “white” {{form to the}} alternative “opaque” form to become mating competent. Pheromones secreted by opaque cells induce the formation of polarized mating projections and result in cell–cell conjugation. In contrast, white cells are unable to undergo mating, but can still respond to pheromone by expression of adhesion genes that promote biofilm formation. In this study, we have analyzed the dual ability of pheromones to activate mating by opaque cells and biofilm formation by white cells. We first {{show that there is}} considerable plasticity in interactions between the α pheromone and its receptor, Ste 2, by analysis of analogs of the α pheromone. Significantly, substituted forms of α pheromone can induce a response in opaque cells and this is sufficient to drive same-sex a-a cell fusion and homothallic mating. In addition, pheromone analogs were able to induce adhesion and biofilm formation in white cells of C. albicans. Because of the observed plasticity in pheromone signaling, we subsequently tested putative pheromones from multiple Candida species and identified nonnative ligands that can induce self-mating and biofilm responses in C. albicans. Our findings demonstrate that environmental signals can initiate C. albicans parasexual reproduction and biofilm formation, and highlight the role of the pheromone-signaling apparatus in mediating these functions...|$|R

However, current {{research}} suggests taht some species of amoebae may participate in sexual-like, or 2 ̆ 2 parasexual 2 ̆ 2 activity. Such interactions are termed parasexual because the conventional stages seen during meiosis are not observed. Nevertheless, an exchange of genetic information, {{one of the principal}} characteristics of sexual activity, has been speculated to occur in some amoebozoans such as Cochliopodium. The reason and mechanism for this activity still remains unknown due to the complex and diverse <b>parasexual</b> life <b>cycles</b> in amoebozoans. In this investigation, the amoeba species Cochliopodium pentatrifurcatum was observed for a type of parasexual activity termed fusion, in which the plasma membrane and the nuclei of the cells come together, and then the subsequent activity termed fission, in which the fused amoeba, also known as plasmodium, splits apart into smaller individual cells. The mechanism for fission as well as the behavior of the cells post fission is poorly understood; hence, the focus of this investigation. In order to investigate post fusion activity, cells resulting from fission were used to grow monoclonal cultures, and these cultures were stained and 2 ̆ 2 mixed 2 ̆ 2 to determine if there is a trend in fusing frequency. In addition to this, we also investigated the existence of gametes in the form of small nuclear sized mini-cells. Currently, no 2 ̆ 2 mating types 2 ̆ 2 have been indicated in Cochliopodium pentatrifurcatum due to staining difficulties; however, fusion and fission have been observed in C. pentatrifurcatum cells and is believed to occur through various different mechanisms...|$|R

In this study, we genetically characterized a UV-generated A. nigermutant that was originally isolated as a nonacidifying mutant, which is a desirable trait for industrial enzyme production. Physiological analysis showed that this mutant did not secrete large amounts of citric acid and oxalic acid, thus explaining the nonacidifying phenotype. As traditional complementation approaches to characterize the mutant genotype were unsuccessful, we used bulk segregant analysis in combination with high-throughput genome sequencing to identify the muta-tion responsible for the nonacidifying phenotype. SinceA. niger has no sexual <b>cycle,</b> <b>parasexual</b> genetics was used to generate haploid segregants derived from diploids by loss of whole chromosomes.

50|$|The genome of C. albicans {{is highly}} dynamic, contributed by the {{different}} CUG translation, and this variability {{has been used}} advantageously for molecular epidemiological studies and population studies in this species. The genome sequence has allowed for identifying {{the presence of a}} <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> (no detected meiotic division) in C. albicans. This study of the evolution of sexual reproduction in six Candida species found recent losses in components of the major meiotic crossover-formation pathway, but retention of a minor pathway. The authors suggested that if Candida species undergo meiosis it is with reduced machinery, or different machinery, and indicated that unrecognized meiotic cycles may exist in many species. In another evolutionary study, introduction of partial CUG identity redefinition (from Candida species) into Saccharomyces cerevisiae clones caused a stress response that negatively affected sexual reproduction. This CUG identity redefinition, occurring in ancestors of Candida species, was thought to lock these species into a diploid or polyploid state with possible blockage of sexual reproduction.|$|E

40|$|Theory {{predicts that}} stress {{is a key}} factor in {{explaining}} the evolutionary role of sex in facultatively sexual organisms, including microorganisms. Organisms capable of reproducing both sexually and asexually are expected to mate more frequently when stressed, and such stress-induced mating is predicted to facilitate adaptation. Here, we propose that stress has an analogous effect on the <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> in Candida albicans, which involves alternation of generations between diploid and tetraploid cells. The <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> can generate high levels of diversity, including aneuploidy, yet it apparently occurs only rarely in nature.

40|$|Strains Mc 2 and Mc 3 are {{morphological}} mutants of the melanized, pathogenic fungus Wangiella dermatitidis.

At the restrictive temperature (37 degrees C), uninucleate yeast {{cells of}} strains Mc 2 and Mc 3 cease budding and initiate an isotropic mode of cellular development, which {{is reflected in}} the formation of a multicellular and multinucleate morphology. Because W. dermatitidis either lacks or has an undiscovered sexual <b>cycle,</b> <b>parasexual</b> methods of analysis were used to confirm that mcm 2 and mcm 3 define separate bud emergence control genes in the wild-type strain. Spheroplasts of albino auxotrophs derived from strains Mc 2 and Mc 3 were fused and then regenerated on minimal medium. The resulting fusion products grew as darkly pigmented, prototrophic colonies. When incubated at 37 degrees C, all fusion products exhibited polarized growth predominantly as uninucleate, budding yeasts and less frequently as pseudohyphae and moniliform hyphae. Subsequent analysis of cultures derived from albino, ts segregants, which were induced from fusion products by using methyl benzimidazole- 2 -yl-carbamate, revealed three types of cell populations. Two resembled those expressed by strain Mc 2 or Mc 3. The third consisted of a cell population unlike the former, suggesting the presence of both ts mutations in all cells. These results imply that yeast development in the fusion products resulted from intergenic complementation of mcm 2 and mcm 3, i. e., they are nonallelic. Because mcm 2 and mcm 3 are equivalent to certain cdc lesions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have renamed the analogous genes defined by the mutations in W. dermatitidis as CDC 1 and CDC 2.

40|$|Candida albicans has an elaborate, yet efficient, {{mating system}} that {{promotes}} conjugation between diploid a and a strains. The product of mating is a tetraploid a/a cell that must undergo a reductional division {{to return to}} the diploid state. Despite the presence of several ‘‘meiosis-specific’ ’ genes in the C. albicans genome, a meiotic program has not been observed. Instead, tetraploid products of mating can be induced to undergo efficient, random chromosome loss, often producing strains that are diploid, or close to diploid, in ploidy. Using SNP and comparative genome hybridization arrays we have now analyzed the genotypes of products from the C. albicans <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle.</b> We show that the <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> generates progeny strains with shuffled combinations of the eight C. albicans chromosomes.

Parasexuality, a non-sexual mode of genetic exchange unique to some fungi has been demonstrated in the laboratory in Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (FOC). The goals of this dissertation were threefold: to ascertain whether mitochondrial (mt) markers can distinguish race differences in FOC; to determine genetic relatedness of VCGs in FOC based on a mt marker; and to discover the mode of mt inheritance during a <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle.</b> ^ Band patterns produced by electrophoresis of Hae III digested genomic DNA indicated that VCG differences, not race, could be discerned by mtDNA analysis. Primers were designed to amplify a mt intergenic locus which served as a molecular marker to screen 55 strains of FOC in 16 VCGs using both single strand conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing. Based on homogeneity of the locus, strains were assigned to seven mitotypes, a classification unit which I introduced and found informative for grouping related VCGs. ^ To determine the mode of mt inheritance during a <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle,</b> strains in different mitotypes were paired. Mitochondrial inheritance in all hybrid progeny was found to be uniparental. I speculated that if a <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> occurs in nature there would be greater variation in the nuclear genome than the mt.

Candida albicans, the most studied Candida species and a prevalent human fungal pathogen, com-pletes its sexual cycle via a parasexual process of concerted chromosome loss rather than a conventional meiosis. In this study, we examine ploidy changes in Candida tropicalis, a closely related species to C. albicans that was recently revealed to undergo sexual mating. C. tropicalis diploid cells mate to form tetraploid cells, and we show that these can be induced to undergo chro-mosome loss to regenerate diploid forms by growth on sorbose medium. The diploid products are themselves mating competent, thereby establishing a <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> in this species for the first time. Extended incubation (> 120 generations) of C. tropicalis tetraploid cells under rich culture conditions also resulted in instability of the tetraploid form and a gradual reduction in ploidy back to the diploid state.

Furthermore, subsequent to heterokaryon formation potential mechanisms exist which may generate genetic variability. One is through viral transfer upon hyphal anastomosis.

The heterokaryons B 84 (med) //G 422 (med+) and B 84 (med) //G 839 (brl) were formed in liquid MM+ 2 % CM and inoculated in the appropriate selective media. Two mitotic segregant groups were obtained: aneuploids and haploid stable recombinants. Mitotic segregants, wild-types, and developmental mutants, which did not produce new visible mitotic sectors in the presence of Benomyl and which showed normal meiotic behavior during the sexual cycle, were classified as parameiotic...|$|E
40|$|The human {{pathogenic}} fungus Candida albicans {{has traditionally}} been classified as a diploid, asexual organism. However, mating-competent forms of the organism were recently described that produced tetraploid mating products. In principle, the C. albicans life cycle could be completed via a sexual process, via a parasexual mechanism, or by both mechanisms. Here we describe conditions in which growth of a tetraploid strain of C. albicans on Saccharomyces cerevisiae ‘pre-sporulation’ medium induced efficient, random chromosome loss in the tetraploid. The products of chromosome loss were often strains that were diploid, or very close to diploid, in DNA content. If they inherited the appropiate MTL (mating-type like) loci, these diploid products were themselves mating competent. Thus, an efficient <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> can be performed in C. albicans, one {{that leads to the}} reassortment of genetic material in this organism. We show that this parasexual cycle—consisting of mating followed by chromosome loss—can be used in the laboratory for simple genetic manipulations in C. albicans...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} aggregation-deficient (aggregateless) mutants were {{isolated}} in genetically marked haploid {{strains of the}} cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum. Diploids were produced from pairs of such haploid mutants by a fusion system based on this organism's <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle.</b> The diploids were isolated from the haploids by using complementation of non-allelic growth-temperature-sensitive mutations and selection at the restrictive temperature. Complementation between the aggregateless mutations was then assessed in 419 diploids so formed. The non-complementing aggregateless mutations fell into five complementation groups (agoA, B, C, D and E) and a dominant aggregation class that allowed little or no aggregation when present in a diploid {{with any of the}} other mutations tested or the parental wild type. Complicating factors, including partial dominance, multiple mutations, and possible interallelic complementation, are discussed. Data on the linkage of the aggregateless mutations was obtained by using recessive drug resistance mutations on three linkage groups to segregate haploids from the diploids. Calculations from our results suggest a genetic complexity of about 50 genes that are specific and essential for aggregation...|$|E
40|$|Wild-type {{isolates}} of Dictyostelium discoideum exhibited {{differences in}} the size of restriction fragments of the extrachromosomal 88 -kilobase ribosomal DNA (rDNA) palindrome. Polymorphisms in rDNA also were found among strains derived solely from the NC 4 wild-type isolate. These variations involved EcoRI fragments II, III, and V; they included loss of the EcoRI site separating fragments II and V and deletion and insertion of DNA. More than one rDNA form can coexist in the same diploid or haploid cell. However, one or another parental rDNA tended to predominate in diploids constructed, using the <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle,</b> between haploid NC 4 -derived strains and haploid wild-type isolates. In some cases, most if not all of the rDNA of such diploids were of one form after ca. 50 generations of growth. Segregant haploids, derived from diploids that possessed predominantly a single rDNA allele, possessed the same allele as the diploid and did not recover the other form. This evidence implies that replication does not proceed from a single chromosomal or extrachromosomal copy of the rDNA during the asexual life cycle of D. discoideum...|$|E
40|$|Crossing {{experiments}} via hyphal anastomosis {{between two}} strains contrasting for auxotrophic markers of Trichoderma pseudokoningii {{were conducted to}} characterize the somatic recombination process in this specie. Four crossings were made {{and a total of}} 1052 colonies obtained from conidial suspensions of the heterokaryotic colonies were analyzed. Sixty-eight recombinant colonies, from four growing generations, were analyzed for the auxotrophic markers. Of the 68 colonies analyzed, 58 were stable after four generations and the remainders were unstable, reverting to one of the parentals. Most of the recombinant colonies were unstable through subculture and after four growing generations they showed the leu ino met markers (auxotrophic for leucin, inositol and metionin respectively). The unstable recombinant colonies showed irregular growing borders, sparse sporulation and frequent sector formation. The results suggest the occurrence of recombination mechanisms in the heterokaryon (somatic recombination), different from those described for the <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> or parameiosis. Therefore, we proposed the ocurrence of nuclei degradation from one parental (non prevalent parental) in the heterokaryon and that the resulting chromosomal fragments may be incorporated into whole nuclei of the another parental (prevalent parental). However the parameiosis as originally described cannot be excluded...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Fusarium oxysporum species complex (FOSC) {{contains}} several phylogenetic lineages. Phylogenetic studies {{identified two}} to three major clades within the FOSC. The mitochondrial sequences are highly informative phylogenetic markers, but have been mostly neglected due to technical difficulties. Results: A total of 61 complete mitogenomes of FOSC strains were de novo assembled and annotated. Length variations and intron patterns support the separation of three phylogenetic species. The variable region of the mitogenome that is typical for the genus Fusarium shows two new variants in the FOSC. The variant typical for Fusarium is found in members of all three clades, while variant 2 is found in clades 2 and 3 and variant 3 only in clade 2. The extended set of loci analyzed using a new implementation of the genealogical concordance species recognition method support the identification of three phylogenetic species within the FOSC. Comparative analysis of the mitogenomes in the FOSC revealed ongoing mitochondrial recombination within, but not between phylogenetic species. Conclusions: The recombination indicates {{the presence of a}} <b>parasexual</b> <b>cycle</b> in F. oxysporum. The obstacles hindering the usage of the mitogenomes are resolved by using next generation sequencing and selective genome assemblers, such as GRAbB. Complete mitogenome sequences offer a stable basis and reference point for phylogenetic and population genetic studies...|$|E
