60|$|Miserable! 'For five-and-thirty minutes' by the King's watch, the Berline is {{at a dead}} stand; Round-hat {{arguing with}} Churnboots; tired horses slobbering their meal-and-water; yellow Couriers groping, bungling;--young Bouille asleep, all the while, in the Upper Village, and Choiseul's fine team {{standing}} there at hay. No help for it; not with a King's ransom: the horses deliberately slobber, Round-hat argues, Bouille sleeps. And mark now, in the thick night, do not two Horsemen, with jaded trot, come clank-clanking; and start with half-pause, if one noticed them, at sight of this dim mass of a Berline, and its dull slobbering and arguing; then <b>prick</b> <b>off</b> faster, into the Village? It is Drouet, he and Clerk Guillaume! Still ahead, they two, of the whole riding hurlyburly; unshot, though some brag of having chased them. Perilous is Drouet's errand also; but he is an Old-Dragoon, with his wits shaken thoroughly awake.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have <b>pricked</b> <b>off</b> the tally," [...] said Aylward, who {{had come}} aboard with his lord. [...] "There are seven of the Winchester men, eleven seamen, your squire, young Master Terlake, and nine archers." ...|$|R

You who never looked a Frenchman in the face are <b>pricked</b> <b>off</b> for ninepence a day, and I, who have fought five {{stricken}} fields, can earn but fourpence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye {{need not}} tell me of it, dame," [...] said the Miller, [...] "since I was there myself, and made two pair of legs (and these were not mine, but my mare's,) worth one pair of hands. I judged how it would be, when I saw our host break ranks, with rushing on through that broken {{ploughed}} field, and so as they had made a pricker of me, I e'en <b>pricked</b> <b>off</b> with myself while the play was good." ...|$|R
60|$|He had two Spaniards {{who could}} be trusted to keep the steamer more or less on the course he gave them, while the Cumbria steerd handily, {{which is more than}} all steamers do. There was a {{large-scale}} chart, considerably mildewed, but still legible, in the skipper's room, as well as a pilot guide to the West African coast, while the patent log that towed astern to record the distance run appeared to be working accurately. He could thus, it was evident, depend in some degree upon what is termed dead reckoning, which is comparatively reliable in the case of short distances run in the vicinity of a high, well lighted coast. The one the Cumbria steamed along was, however, not lighted at all, and most of it scarcely rose a foot above sea-level, while when he had ruled the line she was presumed to be travelling on across the chart, and <b>pricked</b> <b>off</b> the distance the patent log told him she had run, there remained the question how far the tide and the Guinea stream had deflected it, and whether the steering and her compasses could be trusted.|$|R
60|$|In {{front of}} the minster and abbey of St. Andrew's was a large square crowded with priests, soldiers, women, friars, and burghers, who made it their common centre for sight-seeing and gossip. Amid the knot of noisy and gesticulating townsfolk, many small parties of mounted knights and squires {{threaded}} their way towards the prince's quarters, where the huge iron-clamped doors were thrown back {{to show that he}} held audience within. Two-score archers stood about the gateway, and beat back from time to time with their bow-staves the inquisitive and chattering crowd who swarmed round the portal. Two knights in full armor, with lances raised and closed visors, sat their horses on either side, while in the centre, with two pages to tend upon him, there stood a noble-faced man in flowing purple gown, who <b>pricked</b> <b>off</b> upon a sheet of parchment the style and title of each applicant, marshalling them in their due order, and giving to each the place and facility which his rank demanded. His long white beard and searching eyes imparted to him an air of masterful dignity, which was increased by his tabardlike vesture and the heraldic barret cap with triple plume which bespoke his office.|$|R
60|$|It is {{astonishing}} {{the difference between}} the fish. One will give you no trouble at all. I have often seen a good big fellow killed in half an hour. Another will take you half a day, and perhaps you may lose him after all. The whale we were now after, at last took to showing fight. He made two or three runs at the boat, but the mate, who was in command, <b>pricked</b> him <b>off</b> with the lance cleverly. At last we gave him a severe wound, and immediately he dived.|$|R
60|$|To her, Jesus was beautifully remote, {{shining in}} the distance, like a white moon at sunset, a {{crescent}} moon beckoning as it follows the sun, out of our ken. Sometimes dark clouds standing very far <b>off,</b> <b>pricking</b> up into a clear yellow band of sunset, of a winter evening, reminded her of Calvary, sometimes the full moon rising blood-red upon the hill terrified her {{with the knowledge that}} Christ was now dead, hanging heavy and dead upon the Cross.|$|R
60|$|Just what I wanted. The Snark's {{position}} {{was at the}} western entrance of the passage between Viti Levu and Mbengha. The immediate place she was bound to was {{a place on the}} chart ten miles north of Vatu Leile. I <b>pricked</b> that place <b>off</b> on the chart with my dividers, and with my parallel rulers found that west-by-south was the true course. I had but to give it to the man at the wheel and the Snark would win her way to the safety of the open sea.|$|R
6000|$|So {{his mother}} said, 'Very well, {{go to your}} aunt in the {{neighbouring}} village, and fetch me a comb.' The Hazel-nut child jumped quickly out of the egg-shell and ran out into the street. Here he found a man on horseback who was just setting out for the neighbouring village. He crept up the horse's leg, sat down under the saddle, {{and then began to}} pinch the horse and to prick it with a pin. The horse plunged and reared and then set off at a hard gallop, which it continued in spite of its rider's efforts to stop it. When they reached the village, the Hazel-nut child left <b>off</b> <b>pricking</b> the horse, and the poor tired creature pursued its way at a snail's pace. The Hazel-nut child took advantage of this, and crept down the horse's leg; then he ran to his aunt and asked her for a comb. On the way home he met another rider, and did the return journey in exactly the same way. When he handed his mother the comb that his aunt had given him, she was much amazed and asked him, 'But how did you manage to get back so quickly?' ...|$|R
50|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} Type I is prevalent in Malaysia, where 93% of females from Muslim families in an unpublished study have been mutilated. It {{is widely considered}} as a female sunnah tradition (sunat perempuan), typically {{in the old days}} done by midwife (mak bidan) and now by medical physician. It is either a minor <b>prick</b> or cutting <b>off</b> a small piece of the highest part of clitoral hood and foreskin (Type I). Malaysian women claim religious obligation (82%) as the primary reason for female circumcision, with hygiene (41%) and cultural practice (32%) as other major motivators for FGM prevalence. Malaysia is a multicultural society, FGM is prevalent in Muslim community, and not observed in its minority Buddhist and Hindu communities. Malaysia has no laws in reference to FGM. The Malaysian government sponsored 86th conference of Malaysiaâ€™s Fatwa Committee National Council of Islamic Religious Affairs held in April 2009 decided that female circumcision is part of Islamic teachings and it should be observed by Muslims, with the majority of the jurists in the Committee concluding that female circumcision is obligatory (wajib). However, the fatwa noted harmful circumcision methods are to be avoided. In 2012, Malaysian government health ministry proposed guidelines to reclassify and allow female circumcision as a medical practice.|$|R

[...] Sir Anthony Gloster's carriage--our 'ouse-flag flyin' free-- [...] Ten thousand men on the pay-roll and forty freighters at sea! [...] He made himself and a million, but this world is a fleetin' show, [...] And he'll go to the wife of 'is bosom the same as he ought to go. [...] By the heel of the Paternosters--there isn't a chance to mistake-- [...] And Mac'll pay you the money as soon as the bubbles break! [...] Five thousand for six weeks' cruising, the stanchest freighter afloat, [...] And Mac he'll give you your bonus the minute I'm out o' the boat! [...] He'll take you round to Macassar, and you'll come back alone; [...] He knows what I want o' the Mary.... I'll do what I please with my own. [...] Your mother 'ud call it wasteful, but I've seven-and-thirty more; [...] I'll come in my private carriage and bid it wait at the door.... For my son 'e was never a credit: 'e muddled with books and art, [...] And 'e lived on Sir Anthony's money and 'e broke Sir Anthony's heart. [...] There isn't even a grandchild, and the Gloster family's done-- [...] The only one you left me, O mother, the only one! [...] Harrer an' Trinity College! Me slavin' early an' late, [...] An' he thinks I'm dyin' crazy, and you're in Macassar Strait! [...] Flesh o' my flesh, my dearie, for ever an' ever amen, [...] That first stroke come for a warning; I ought to ha' gone to you then, [...] But--cheap repairs for a cheap 'un--the doctors said I'd do: [...] Mary, why didn't you warn me? I've allus heeded to you, [...] Excep'--I know--about women; but you are a spirit now; [...] An', wife, they was only women, and I was a man. That's how. [...] An' a man 'e must go with a woman, as you could not understand; [...] But I never talked 'em secrets. I paid 'em out o' hand. [...] Thank Gawd, I can pay for my fancies! Now what's five thousand to me, [...] For a berth off the Paternosters in the haven where I would be? [...] I believe in the Resurrection, if I read my Bible plain, [...] But I wouldn't trust 'em at Wokin'; we're safer at sea again. [...] For the heart it shall go with the treasure--go down to the sea in [...] ships. [...] I'm sick of the hired women--I'll kiss my girl on her lips! [...] I'll be content with my fountain, I'll drink from my own well, [...] And the wife of my youth shall charm me--an' the rest can go to Hell! [...] (Dickie, he will, that's certain.) I'll lie in our standin'-bed, [...] An' Mac'll take her in ballast--and she trims best by the head.... Down by the head an' sinkin'. Her fires are drawn and cold, [...] And the water's splashin' hollow on the skin of the empty hold-- [...] Churning an' choking and chuckling, quiet and scummy and dark-- [...] Full to her lower hatches and risin' steady.

You write to the Board, and tell [...] Your father's death has upset you an' you're goin' to cruise for a spell, [...] An' you'd like the Mary Gloster -- I've held her ready for this -- [...] They'll put her in working order and you'll take her out as she is. [...] Yes, it was money idle when I patched her and put her aside [...] (Thank God, I can pay for my fancies!) -- the boat where your mother died, [...] By the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank, [...] We dropped her -- I think I told you -- and I <b>pricked</b> it <b>off</b> where she sank -- [...] ['Tiny she looked on the grating -- that oily, treacly sea --] [...] 'Hundred and eighteen East, remember, and South just three. [...] Easy bearings to carry -- three South -- three to the dot; [...] But I gave M'Andrew a copy in case of dying -- or not. [...] And so you'll write to M'Andrew, he's Chief of the Maori Line; [...] They'll give him leave, if you ask 'em and say it's business o' mine. [...] I built three boats for the Maoris, an' very well pleased they were, [...] An' I've known Mac since the Fifties, and Mac knew me -- and her. [...] After the first stroke warned me I sent him the money to keep [...] Against the time you'd claim it, committin' your dad to the deep; [...] For you are the son o' my body, and Mac was my oldest friend, [...] I've never asked 'im to dinner, but he'll see it out to the end. [...] Stiff-necked Glasgow beggar, I've heard he's prayed for my soul, [...] But he couldn't lie if you paid him, and he'd starve before he stole! [...] He'll take the Mary in ballast -- you'll find her a lively ship; [...] And you'll take Sir Anthony Gloster, that goes on 'is wedding-trip, [...] Lashed in our old deck-cabin with all three port-holes wide, [...] The kick o' the screw beneath him and the round blue seas outside! [...] Sir Anthony Gloster's carriage -- our 'ouse-flag flyin' free -- [...] Ten thousand men on the pay-roll and forty freighters at sea! [...] He made himself and a million, but this world is a fleetin' show, [...] And he'll go to the wife of 'is bosom the same as he ought to go -- [...] By the heel of the Paternosters -- there isn't a chance to mistake -- [...] And Mac'll pay you the money as soon as the bubbles break! [...] Five thousand for six weeks' cruising, the staunchest freighter afloat, [...] And Mac he'll give you your bonus the minute I'm out o' the boat! [...] He'll take you round to Macassar, and you'll come back alone; [...] He knows what I want o' the Mary. [...] . I'll do what I please with my own. [...] Your mother 'ud call it wasteful, but I've seven-and-thirty more; [...] I'll come in my private carriage and bid it wait at the door. [...] For my son 'e was never a credit: 'e muddled with books and art, [...] And 'e lived on Sir Anthony's money and 'e broke Sir Anthony's heart. [...] There isn't even a grandchild, and the Gloster family's done -- [...] The only one you left me, O mother, the only one! [...] Harrer and Trinity College -- me slavin' early an' late -- [...] An' he thinks I'm dying crazy, and you're in Macassar Strait! [...] Flesh o' my flesh, my dearie, for ever an' ever amen, [...] That first stroke come for a warning; I ought to ha' gone to you then, [...] But -- cheap repairs for a cheap 'un -- the doctors said I'd do: [...] Mary, why didn't you warn me? I've allus heeded to you, [...] Excep' -- I know -- about women; but you are a spirit now; [...] An', wife, they was only women, and I was a man. That's how. [...] An' a man 'e must go with a woman, as you could not understand; [...] But I never talked 'em secrets. I paid 'em out o' hand. [...] Thank Gawd, I can pay for my fancies! Now what's five thousand to me, [...] For a berth off the Paternosters in the haven where I would be? [...] I believe in the Resurrection, if I read my Bible plain, [...] But I wouldn't trust 'em at Wokin'; we're safer at sea again. [...] For the heart it shall go with the treasure -- go down to the sea in ships. [...] I'm sick of the hired women -- I'll kiss my girl on her lips! [...] I'll be content with my fountain, I'll drink from my own well, [...] And the wife of my youth shall charm me -- an' the rest can go to Hell! [...] (Dickie, he will, that's certain.) I'll lie in our standin'-bed, [...] An' Mac'll take her in ballast -- an' she trims best by the head. [...] Down by the head an' sinkin', her fires are drawn and cold, [...] And the water's splashin' hollow on the skin of the empty hold -- [...] Churning an' choking and chuckling, quiet and scummy and dark -- [...] Full to her lower hatches and risin' steady. Hark! [...] That was the after-bulkhead. [...] . She's flooded from stem to stern. [...] Never seen death yet, Dickie? [...] . Well, now is your time to learn! ...|$|R
