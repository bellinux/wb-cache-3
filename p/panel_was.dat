30|$|Ten laboratory-scale 10 -ply LVL <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> manufactured. Six <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> made of {{eucalypt}} veneer only, choosing {{veneer sheets}} of defined MoE grades {{based on their}} dynamic MoE values. One <b>panel</b> each <b>was</b> made from 12, 14, or 17.5  GPa sheets and three <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> made from 16  GPa sheets. Each LVL panel contained veneer from one or two logs only. Another four <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> made of five radiata pine and five eucalypt veneer plies. A range of eucalypt grades were used in these panels. The first (14  GPa), third (17  GPa), sixth (14  GPa), eighth (12  GPa) and tenth layers (12  GPa) were eucalypt veneers and the rest were radiata pine. Two <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> made from each of G 2 and G 4 radiata-pine grades. A typical phenolic formaldehyde adhesive manufactured by Aica NZ Limited was used {{at a rate of}} 180  g/m 2. <b>Panels</b> <b>were</b> hot-pressed at 160  °C with a pressure of 1.2  MPa.|$|R
5|$|The <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> {{not used}} for the finale, however, Judi James made a {{recorded}} segment about each finalist. The panel format was scrapped for the following celebrity and regular series, where McCall interviewed the evictee in the traditional format.|$|E
5|$|The winning {{song was}} chosen by the public through televoting and a jury, {{weighted}} at 60% and 40% of the result respectively. The jury <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> made up of Mimis Plessas, Antonis Andrikakis, Dimitris Starovas, Themos Anastasiadis, Christina Politi, Evangelia Piskera, Antonis Karatzikos, Rena Kapitsala, and a ninth vote was split between Sietse Bakker of ESCToday and Fotis Konstantopoulos of Oikotimes.|$|E
5|$|Art {{historians have}} {{suggested}} completion dates {{ranging from the}} early 1440s to the early 1460s, with c. 1455 seen as probable. The <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> acquired by Andrew Mellon in the 1930s, {{and was one of}} several hundreds from his personal collection donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington. It has suffered damage and was restored in the early 1990s for an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{concrete-filled}} {{glass fiber}} reinforced gypsum wall <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> {{a kind of}} panel that the inside cavums of the glass fiber hollow gypsum <b>panel</b> <b>are</b> filled with concrete, {{which can be used}} as the bearing wall of a building. The influences of eccentricity distance and height to thickness ratio on the bearing capacity of the compression wall <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> studied, and the failure mechanism and bearing capacity of compression wall <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> gained through the experiments of twenty-seven(nine groups) axial compression wall panel specimens and twenty-seven(nine groups) eccentric compression wall panel specimens. The analysis results indicate that the bearing capacity of compression wall <b>panels</b> <b>is</b> obviously affected by the eccentricity distance and height to thickness ratio, and there is a linear relation between bearing capacity and eccentricity distance. The bearing capacity calculation formula of the concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum wall <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> obtained by regression analysis, which provides reliable gist for structural design of concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum wall panel buildings...|$|R
50|$|In September 2011, 2,000 solar <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> {{installed}} on landfill property converted to parkland {{and later a}} solar farm. The <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> paid for by a Maryland Department of Energy Grant.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1980 the {{eligibility}} year for nominations {{was set to}} the calendar year, rather than December–November as initially conceived, and the SFWA organizing <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> allowed to add an additional work. Authors were also allowed to use the mass-market paperback publication of their books {{as the beginning of}} their nomination period, rather than the initial hardback publication. As a consequence of the combination of this rule and the rolling eligibility, the 2007 awards, despite nominally being for works published in 2006, instead were all given to works initially published in 2005. Beginning with the 2010 awards, the rolling eligibility system and paperback publication exemption were replaced with the current rules.|$|E
5|$|Four large mosaic {{panels are}} {{installed}} on either {{ends of the}} station hall and the two escalator tunnels. On the side {{that leads to the}} exit to the city, a <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> installed depicting the patron saint of Kiev, Michael the Archangel. Meanwhile, {{at the very end of}} the station, Saint George is depicted, symbolizing Moscow, the Soviet Union's capital at the time. One of the mosaic panels at the end of the station near the escalators includes an inscription featuring a Ukrainian nationalist slogan, stating СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ, which is translated as Glory to Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|Late 20th-century {{technical}} examination has shown {{significant differences in}} technique and style between the panels of individual diptychs. The technical inconsistencies {{may be the result}} of the workshop system, in which the more prosaic passages were often completed by assistants. A change in style between panels can be seen, according to historian John Hand, because the divine <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> usually based on general designs sold on the open market, with the donor panel added after a patron was found.|$|E
30|$|The {{manufactured}} <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> conditioned at 20  °C and 65  % {{relative humidity}} for 2  weeks. The internal bonding (IB) {{strength of the}} <b>panels</b> <b>was</b> determined according to JIS A 5908 [10].|$|R
50|$|Addressable <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> {{usually more}} {{advanced}} than their conventional counterparts, with greater information capacity and control flexibility. Addressable fire alarm <b>panels</b> <b>were</b> introduced by many manufacturers during the microcontroller boom in the mid 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The {{triptych}} is oil on wood {{of three}} parts, with gold ground. The {{left and right}} <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> each 68.5 in by 26 in, and the middle <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> 68.5 in by 60 in.|$|R
5|$|On 27 April 2015, it was {{announced}} that Lee had been handed a backdated eight-month ban for his anti-doping rule violation. The <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> convinced that Lee had no intent to cheat and allowed him to resume his career by 1 May 2015. Lee was stripped of his silver medal from the 2014 World Championships but allowed to keep his two bronze medals from the 2014 Asian Games.|$|E
5|$|The Child has curly {{blond hair}} and sits on a white cloth, {{animated}} and upright, {{at the side of}} the Virgin's lap. Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, his head in three quarters view. He reaches for what seems to be a parrot perched on her lap. At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele {{is a large}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} completed around 1434–36 by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It {{shows the}} painting's donor, Joris van der Paele, within an apparition of saints. The Virgin Mary is enthroned at {{the centre of the}} semicircular space, which most likely represents a church interior, with the Christ Child on her lap. St. Donatian stands to her right, Saint George—the donor's name saint—to her left. The <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> commissioned by van der Paele as an altarpiece. He was then a wealthy clergyman from Bruges, but elderly and gravely ill, and intended the work as his memorial.|$|E
50|$|Fence <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> {{supported}} with counter-weighted feet, have a {{wide variety}} of accessories including gates, handrails, feet and bracing depending on the application. Fence <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> commonly constructed of either chain link or weld mesh.|$|R
50|$|The {{inscriptions}} on {{the central}} <b>panel</b> <b>are</b> fragments from the Book of Wisdom (7:26 and 7:29), and Ecclesiastes (24: 23-24). Those on the wing <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> taken from texts referring directly to the two saints.|$|R
5000|$|The {{corrugated}} <b>panels</b> <b>are</b> {{made from}} eco-friendly steel that is pre-punched, and predrilled at a factory. Each <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> coated with Galvalume Plus which helps {{to reflect the}} heat, cooling the building on the inside.|$|R
5|$|The {{attribution}} {{of the panel}} reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now {{thought to have been}} completed c. 1438–40, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.|$|E
5|$|A Historical Overview Committee of sportswriters {{appointed}} by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met to develop a ballot of 10 managers and umpires. The managers/umpires list was then submitted to a panel composed of Hall of Fame members, executives and veteran media members for a final vote. A separate ballot of 10 executives was developed by a panel including executives, players and writers, which was the same committee which finally voted in that area. The final ballots were released in November 2009. Each panel member was allowed to vote for up to four individuals on each ballot, and each candidate who received 75% of the vote from either <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> elected; therefore, a maximum of five inductions were possible from each ballot. Voting was conducted at baseball's winter meetings in Indianapolis on December 6, 2009, with the results announced the next day; {{as was the case}} with the 2008 class of inductees, the Committee met to discuss the candidates, although the previous three elections had been conducted by mail.|$|E
5|$|After Kapoor's {{design for}} the {{sculpture}} was selected during a design competition, numerous technological concerns regarding the design's construction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns regarding the sculpture's upkeep and maintenance. Experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture's construction fell behind schedule. Cloud Gate was unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration, as the grid of welds around each metal <b>panel</b> <b>was</b> still visible. The sculpture was concealed again while it was completed; in early 2005, workers polished out the seams. Cloud Gate was formally dedicated on May 15, 2006, and it has since gained considerable popularity, both domestically and internationally.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} article, the linear and the {{nonlinear}} deformation behaviour of functionally graded (FG) spherical shell <b>panel</b> <b>are</b> examined under thermomechanical load. The temperature-dependent effective material properties of FG shell <b>panel</b> <b>are</b> evaluated using Voigt’s micro-mechanical rule {{in conjunction with}} power-law distribution. The nonlinear mathematical model of the FG shell <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> developed based on higher-order shear deformation theory and Green-Lagrange type geometrical nonlinearity. The desired nonlinear governing equation of the FG shell <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> computed using the variational principle. The model is discretised through suitable nonlinear finite element steps and solved using direct iterative method. The convergence and the validation behaviour of the present numerical model are performed to show {{the efficacy of the}} model. The effect of different parameters on the nonlinear deformation behaviour of FG spherical shell <b>panel</b> <b>is</b> highlighted by solving numerous examples...|$|R
