This is due to high labor requirements for transportation and processing activities incurred by high-yielding varieties. The study further indicates a negative relationship between the adoption of high-yielding cassava varieties and distance to fields, the use of headload/backload as transportation means, and lack of processing machines in the village. This means that farmers are less likely to adopt high-yielding varieties of cassava where transportation and processing activities of cassava are carried out manually...|$|E

As a first step towards assessing the likelihood of local transmission of these viruses in Europe, we estimated the number of viremic <b>person-days</b> among air-travellers arriving in the European Union (EU). MethodsFor dengue, we developed a Monte Carlo model with the following parameters: probability distributions based on quarterly incidences in endemic countries (years 2003 – 2007), passenger flow from endemic to EU countries (year 2006), duration of viremia, probability of being viremic upon arrival, distribution and period of vector activity in the EU. For chikungunya, due to scarce incidence data, we developed a model with point estimates. ResultsWe estimated at 4763 (range 3067 – 7019) the median dengue viremic <b>person-days</b> in 2006 with highest estimate among travellers from Asia during the third quarter. Dengue estimates among travellers arriving in EU Aedes-infested areas from April to October were 169 viremic <b>person-days,</b> 130 arriving in Italy. For chikungunya, we estimated 6 viremic <b>person-days</b> in EU Aedes-infested areas among air-travellers from India; all occurred in Italy. ConclusionOur results are a first step towards a real estimation {{of the risk of}} local dengue transmission in Europe.

ObjectiveTo explore the relation between adolescent travel (using a spatial measure of activity space size) and daily moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), {{with a focus on}} school days. MethodsWe used Global Positioning Systems to manually identify trips and generate activity spaces for each person-day; quantified by area for 39 students (13. 8 ± 0. 6 years, 38 % female) attending high school in urban Downtown Vancouver, Canada. We assessed the association between activity space area and MVPA using multi-level regression. We calculated total, school-day and trip-based MVPA for each valid <b>person-day</b> (accelerometry; ≥ 600 min wear time). ResultsOn school days, students accrued 68. 2 min/day (95 % CI 60. 4 – 76. 0) of MVPA. Daily activity spaces averaged 2. 2 km 2 (95 % CI 1. 3 – 3. 0). There was no association between activity space size and school-day MVPA. Students accrued 21. 8 min/day (95 % CI 19. 2 – 24. 4) of MVPA during school hours, 19. 4 min/day (95 % CI 15. 1 – 23. 7) during travel, and 28. 3 min/day (95 % CI 22. 3 – 34. 3) elsewhere.

40|$|Center-based {{telecommuting}} {{has many}} hypothesized benefits. To determine its {{value as a}} transportation demand management strategy, however, its travel-related benefits must be established quantitatively. This research provides the first analysis of the impacts of center-based telecommuting on individual travel behavior and emissions, using travel diary data from the Puget Sound Telecommuting Demonstration Project. An analysis of personal vehicle usage for this small sample of workers showed {{that the number of}} vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) was reduced significantly as a result of center-based telecommuting (from 63. 25 miles per <b>person-day</b> on non- telecommuting days to 29. 31 miles on telecommuting days). The reductions in weekday VMT comprise significant reductions ha commute-related VMT with insignificant changes in non-commute- related VMT. The number of personal vehicle trips did not change significantly. In essence, center-based telecommuters behave as conventional commuters in terms of their number of trips, but are more similar to home-based telecommuters in terms of VMT reductions. The significant reduction in VMT translates into a 49 % decrease in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions and a 53 % decrease in particulate matter (PM) emissions comparing telecommuting days to non-telecommuting days for the small sample. Because the number of daily trips was not impacted by telecommuting, the levels of emissions associated with the cold start process, total organic gases (TOG) and carbon monoxide (CO), were essentially unaffected. Of course, region-wide impacts will be much smaller when the proportion of telecommuters in the workforce and the frequency of telecommuting is considered...|$|E

40|$|Baseline {{data and}} data taken both {{during and after}} a {{watershed}} development program, recording cropping activities in a semi-arid watershed in Telangana, India, were analyzed. Watershed development contributed to the sustainable yield improvement of dryland crops by rehabilitating the productive capacity of the land through water and soil conservation techniques. On the basis of long-term data collected from farm households in the watershed, we explored ways to increase crop productivity and sustainability. Investment in {{soil and water conservation}} significantly impacted agricultural development, most particularly during droughts. Farmers realized returns to land amounting to US $ 720 ha− 1 from cotton, $ 295 ha− 1 from flowers, $ 287 ha− 1 from vegetables and $ 171 ha− 1 from cereals. Mean returns to labour, irrespective of crop strategies, was $ 10 per <b>person-day.</b> Irrigation facilities in the watershed encouraged the growing of water-intensive crops but dryland crops were also more profitable as various in-situ and ex-situ interventions increased soil-moisture, providing congenial conditions for them. The responses were best during the watershed intervention period: yields of maize inter cropped with pigeonpea were increased by 148 %, pigeonpea 100 %, sole sorghum 91 % and cotton 76. 2 %. While droughts reduced the average share of household crop income in the non-watershed area from 44 to 12 %, this share remained unchanged at about 36 % in the watershed area. We deduce that watershed interventions have a positive influence on building resilient crop production...|$|E

With the effect, both the teacher and students have leaned towards lightweight learning method using Extreme Programming (XP). Pair Programming, which is one among the twelve practices of XP has been widely used by the pedagogical community.

Also, the researchers incorporating pair programming, have not given much importance for program assignments and program correction. To address these problems, we have developed a Generic software teaching and learning model called GSOFT with few software development practices, and pair programming. COSMIC FFP (Common Software Measurement Integration Consortium Full Function Point) standard was used for program assignments and program evaluation. This method was applied on real time project assigned to student as large scale programs and examined. For this study, the students were grouped into pair programmers (PP) and solo programmers (SP).

A comparison of participants' telecommuting day travel behavior with their before-telecommuting behavior shows a 27 % {{reduction in the number}} of personal vehicle trips, a 77 % decrease in vehicle-miles traveled (VMT), and 39 % (and 4 %) decreases in the number of cold (and hot) engine starts. These decreases in travel translate into emissions reductions of 48 % for total organic gases (TOG), 64 % for carbon monoxide (CO), 69 % for nitrogen oxide (NOx), and 78 % for particulate matter (PM). Although the authors developed the methodology to investigate the emissions impact of telecommuting, the analysis technique can be applied to any demand management or other transportation strategy where all of the necessary model inputs are available. An analysis of the number of personal vehicle trips and VMT partitioned into commute-related and non-commute-related purposes revealed that non-commute personal vehicle trips increase by 0. 5 trips per <b>person-day</b> on average, whereas the non-commute VMT decreased by 5. 3 miles. This important finding supports (for one indicator, the number of trips) the hypothesis that non-commute travel generation is a potential negative impact of telecommuting. This finding demonstrates the need to monitor these changes as telecommuting moves into the mainstream. In this study, however, the small increase in non-commute trips has a negligible impact compared to the overall travel and emissions savings...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{remains unclear}} whether {{benzodiazepine}} use increases hip fracture incidence. We studied this relationship {{in a large}} cohort, controlling for multiple potential confounders. METHODS: We analyzed 42 months of New Jersey Medicaid health care claims data for all enrollees. Each eligible <b>person-day</b> was assigned to categories of benzodiazepine exposure and categories of other predictors, based on prior and current medication dispensing and diagnosis information. Hip fractures were identified based on hospital claims with primary discharge diagnosis International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD- 9) codes 820. xx. RESULTS: Cohort members (n = 125 203) contributed 194 071 person-years and had 2312 eligible hip fractures. After adjustment for age, sex, race, Medicaid nursing home residence, exposure to other psychoactive medications, including antiparkinsonian medications, diagnoses of epilepsy and dementia, and hospitalization in the previous 6 months, the incidence rate of hip fracture was significantly higher compared with no benzodiazepine use for exposure to any benzodiazepine (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1. 24; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 06 - 1. 44), to a short half-life, high-potency benzodiazepine (IRR, 1. 27; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 59), during the first 2 weeks after starting a benzodiazepine (IRR, 2. 05; 95 % CI, 1. 28 - 3. 28), during the second 2 weeks after starting a benzodiazepine (IRR, 1. 88; 95 % CI, 1. 15 - 3. 07), and for continued use (IRR, 1. 18; 95 % CI, 1. 03 - 1. 35).

40|$|To {{investigate}} the incidence, {{risk factors and}} survival of conjunctival acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in adult patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This retrospective study included a total of 139 patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT between January 2012 and December 2014 at a tertiary referral hospital. Patients with ocular complaints after allogeneic HSCT or first donor lymphocyte infusion were evaluated by ophthalmologists. The risk factors for conjunctival aGVHD were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. The overall survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Thirteen (9. 4 %) patients developed conjunctival aGVHD, including eight patients with pseudomembranous conjunctivitis. The cumulative incidence of conjunctival aGVHD was 2. 1 cases per 10, 000 <b>person-day.</b> The median age at HSCT was 47 years (range, 18 to 66) in all patients and 42 years (range, 24 to 58) in the 13 patients with conjunctival aGVHD. Median time of follow-up after allogeneic HSCT was 353 days (range, 11 to 1184). In univariate analysis, grades II-IV skin aGVHD (P = 0. 002) and advanced systemic aGVHD except skin aGVHD (overall grades III-IV) (P = 0. 001) were significant predictors for conjunctival aGVHD. In multivariate analysis, grades II-IV skin aGVHD was a significant risk factor (P = 0. 04). The severity of conjunctival aGVHD was generally correlated with the systemic aGVHD (P = 0. 001). Overall survival was significantly shorter in patients with grades II-IV aGVHD compared to those with grade 0 -I (P = 0. 01). Survival in patients with conjunctival aGVHD {{did not differ significantly}} from those without this complication (P = 0. 94). In the subgroup analysis of patients with grades III-IV aGVHD, survival was significantly longer in patients with conjunctival involvement than those without (P = 0. 03). The severity of conjunctival aGVHD is correlated with systemic aGVHD, but not with inferior overall survival...|$|E
40|$|Background. Adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADR) negatively impact {{life quality}} and are sometimes fatal. This study examines the incidence and predictors of all and preventable ADRs in frail elderly persons after hospital discharge, a highly vulnerable but rarely studied population. Methods. The design was a prospective cohort study involving 808 frail elderly persons who were discharged from 11 Veteran Affairs hospitals to outpatient care. The main outcome measure was number of ADRs per patient {{as determined by}} blinded geriatrician and geropharmacist pairs using Naranjo’s ADR algorithm. For all ADRs (possible, probable, or definite), preventability was assessed. Discordances were resolved by consensus conferences. Results. Overall, 33 % of patients had one or more ADRs for a rate of 1. 92 per 1000 <b>person-days</b> of follow-up. The rate for preventable ADRs was 0. 71 per 1000 <b>person-days</b> of follow-up. Independent risk factors for all ADRs were number o...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundIn Taiwan, liver {{transplantation}} is {{a common}} treatment of end-stage liver diseases. Infection has {{a negative impact on}} the survival of these patients and their grafts. We evaluated the timing and frequency of infections, and the risk factors associated with infection and mortality in liver transplant recipients from Taiwan. MethodsThis retrospective study enrolled all adult patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation from January 2004 to November 2008 at a tertiary hospital in Taiwan. ResultsSixty-eight patients were enrolled (male/female =  46 / 22) and average age was 51. 3 years. Bacterial infection (26 / 68, 38. 2 %) was the most common infectious disease, with a rate of 0. 3 / 1, 000 <b>person-days</b> in the perioperative period, 0. 27 / 1, 000 <b>person-days</b> in the early operative period, and 0. 38 / 1, 000 <b>person-days</b> in the late-operative period. Operation-related complications increased the risk of bacterial infection. Biliary stricture was the most common operation-related complication, and this was associated with biliary tract infection (p <  0. 001). The average time from first stent placement for biliary stricture by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography to biliary tract infection was 34. 5 days. The overall mortality rate was 11. 7 %, and the mortality rate was 14 % for patients with infections. ConclusionsBacterial infection was {{the most common type of}} infection in liver transplant recipients. Surgery-related complication, especially biliary tract stricture was risk factor for infection. We suggest that the current recommendations about the timing of endoscopic retrograde cholangiography intervention be reevaluated...|$|R
