5|$|Walter Skinner assigns Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to {{investigate}} Sandoz's disappearance, {{giving them a}} rubbing of Merkmallen's artifact. Mulder tells Skinner that both Merkmallen and Sandoz espoused <b>panspermia,</b> a theory suggesting an extraterrestrial origin to life on Earth. Mulder begins suffering from a headache and is unable to hear Scully speak, a condition seemingly caused by the rubbing. At the university, the agents meet Dr. Barnes—the man who posed as Sandoz—who professes disbelief in his theories. Mulder's condition worsens, but he refuses {{to go to the}} hospital and, due to seeming telepathic abilities, realizes that Barnes murdered Merkmallen. Later, in Mulder's office, Chuck Burks tells them that the symbols on the artifact are from Navajo.|$|E
5|$|The inner Solar System's {{period of}} giant impacts {{probably}} {{played a role}} in the Earth acquiring its current water content (~6kg) from the early asteroid belt. Water is too volatile to have been present at Earth's formation and must have been subsequently delivered from outer, colder parts of the Solar System. The water was probably delivered by planetary embryos and small planetesimals thrown out of the asteroid belt by Jupiter. A population of main-belt comets discovered in 2006 has been also suggested as a possible source for Earth's water. In contrast, comets from the Kuiper belt or farther regions delivered not more than about 6% of Earth's water. The <b>panspermia</b> hypothesis holds that life itself may have been deposited on Earth in this way, although this idea is not widely accepted.|$|E
25|$|The <b>panspermia</b> {{vehicles}} {{would be}} aimed at moving targets whose locations {{at the time of}} arrival must be predicted. This can be calculated using their measured proper motions, their distances, and the cruising speeds of the vehicles. The positional uncertainty and size of the target object then allow estimating the probability that the <b>panspermia</b> vehicles will arrive at their targets.|$|E
25|$|Directed <b>panspermia</b> is the {{deliberate}} transport of microorganisms in space {{to be used}} as introduced species on lifeless planets.|$|E
25|$|Directed <b>panspermia</b> may {{be aimed}} at nearby young {{planetary}} systems such as Alpha PsA (25 ly (light-years) away) and Beta Pictoris (63.4 ly), both of which show accretion discs and signs of comets and planets. More suitable targets may be identified by space telescopes such as the Kepler mission that will identify nearby star systems with habitable planets. Alternatively, directed <b>panspermia</b> may aim at star-forming interstellar clouds such as Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex (427 ly), that contains clusters of new stars too young to originate local life (425 infrared-emitting young stars aged 100,000 to a million years). Such clouds contain zones with various densities (diffuse cloud < dark fragment < dense core < protostellar condensation < accretion disc) that could selectively capture <b>panspermia</b> capsules of various sizes.|$|E
25|$|According to the <b>panspermia</b> hypothesis, {{microscopic}} life—distributed by meteoroids, asteroids {{and other}} small Solar System bodies—may exist throughout the universe.|$|E
25|$|The <b>panspermia</b> {{hypothesis}} alternatively {{suggests that}} microscopic life was {{distributed to the}} early Earth by meteoroids, asteroids and other small Solar System bodies and that life may exist throughout the Universe. It is speculated that the biochemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when {{the age of the}} universe was only 10 to 17 million years old. The <b>panspermia</b> hypothesis proposes that life originated outside the Earth, not how life came to be.|$|E
25|$|<b>Panspermia</b> is the {{hypothesis}} that life exists throughout the Universe, distributed by meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planetoids, and, also, by spacecraft {{in the form of}} unintended contamination by microorganisms.|$|E
25|$|Directed <b>panspermia</b> {{to secure}} and expand life in space is {{becoming}} {{possible because of}} developments in solar sails, precise astrometry, extrasolar planets, extremophiles and microbial genetic engineering. After determining the composition of chosen meteorites, astroecologists performed laboratory experiments that suggest that many colonizing microorganisms and some plants could obtain many of their chemical nutrients from asteroid and cometary materials. However, the scientists noted that phosphate (PO4) and nitrate (NO3–N) critically limit nutrition to many terrestrial lifeforms. With such materials, and energy from long-lived stars, microscopic life planted by directed <b>panspermia</b> could find an immense future in the galaxy.|$|E
25|$|An {{innovative}} use of {{the diamond}} anvil cell is testing the sustainability and durability of life under high pressures. This innovative use {{can be used in}} the search for life on extrasolar planets. One reason the DAC is applicable for testing life on extrasolar planets is <b>panspermia,</b> a form of interstellar travel. When <b>panspermia</b> occurs, there is high pressure upon impact and the DAC can replicate this pressure. Another reason the DAC is applicable for testing life on extrasolar planets is that planetary bodies that hold the potential for life may have incredibly high pressure on their surface.|$|E
25|$|<b>Panspermia</b> {{is often}} criticized {{because it does}} not answer the {{question}} of the origin of life but merely places it on another celestial body. It was also criticized because it was thought it could not be tested experimentally.|$|E
25|$|<b>Panspermia</b> is a {{hypothesis}} proposing that microscopic life forms that can survive {{the effects of}} space, such as extremophiles, become trapped in debris ejected into space after collisions between planets and small Solar System bodies that harbor life. Some organisms may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with protoplanetary disks. Under certain ideal impact circumstances (into a body of water, for example), and ideal conditions on a new planet's surfaces, {{it is possible that}} the surviving organisms could become active and begin to colonize their new environment. <b>Panspermia</b> is not meant to address how life began, just the method that may cause its distribution in the Universe.|$|E
25|$|The {{longevity}} of human space-faring technological society is uncertain, {{and it would}} be prudent to start a directed <b>panspermia</b> program promptly. This program could secure life and allow it to expand in space and in biodiversity with an immense future for trillions of eons.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} life, known as abiogenesis, {{distinct}} from the evolution of life, is another ongoing field of research. Oparin and Haldane postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive {{to the formation of}} organic compounds from inorganic elements and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative hypothesis of <b>panspermia</b> is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth—the <b>panspermia</b> hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{biological}} {{aspects of}} directed <b>panspermia</b> may {{be improved by}} genetic engineering to produce hardy polyextremophile microorganisms and multicellular organisms, suitable to diverse planetary environments. Hardy polyextremophile anaerobic multicellular eukaryots with high radiation resistance, that can form a self-sustaining ecosystem with cyanobacteria, would combine ideally the features needed for survival and higher evolution.|$|E
25|$|Directed <b>panspermia</b> may be {{motivated}} {{by the desire to}} perpetuate the common genetic heritage of all terrestrial life. This motivation was formulated as biotic ethics that value the common gene/protein patterns of our family of organic life, and as panbiotic ethics that aim to secure and expand life in the universe.|$|E
25|$|Belonging to life then implies panbiotic ethics with {{a purpose}} to {{propagate}} and expand life in space. Directed <b>panspermia</b> for this purpose is becoming possible due to developments in solar sails, precise astrometry, the discovery of extrasolar planets, extremophiles and microbial genetic engineering. Cosmological projections suggest that life in space can then have an immense future.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{mention of the}} term was in the {{writings}} of the 5th century BC Greek philosopher Anaxagoras. <b>Panspermia</b> began to assume a more scientific form through the proposals of Jöns Jacob Berzelius (1834), Hermann E. Richter (1865), Kelvin (1871), Hermann von Helmholtz (1879) and finally reaching the level of a detailed hypothesis through the efforts of the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius (1903).|$|E
25|$|Fred Hoyle (1915–2001) and Chandra Wickramasinghe (born 1939) were {{influential}} {{proponents of}} <b>panspermia.</b> In 1974 they proposed {{the hypothesis that}} some dust in interstellar space was largely organic (containing carbon), which Wickramasinghe later proved to be correct. Hoyle and Wickramasinghe further contended that life forms continue to enter the Earth's atmosphere, and {{may be responsible for}} epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and the genetic novelty necessary for macroevolution.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, active {{directed}} <b>panspermia</b> {{has been}} proposed to secure and expand life in space. This may be motivated by biotic ethics that values, and seeks to propagate, the basic patterns of our organic gene/protein life-form. The panbiotic program would seed new planetary systems nearby, and clusters of new stars in interstellar clouds. These young targets, where local life would not have formed yet, avoid any interference with local life.|$|E
25|$|Pseudo-panspermia (sometimes called soft <b>panspermia,</b> {{molecular}} <b>panspermia</b> or quasi-panspermia) {{proposes that}} the organic molecules used for life originated {{in space and}} were incorporated in the solar nebula, from which the planets condensed and were further —and continuously— distributed to planetary surfaces where life then emerged (abiogenesis). From the early 1970s it was becoming evident that interstellar dust consisted of a large component of organic molecules. The first suggestion came from Chandra Wickramasinghe, who proposed a polymeric composition based on the molecule formaldehyde (CH2O). Interstellar molecules are formed by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar clouds of dust and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with cosmic rays. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E
25|$|Asteroids contain {{traces of}} amino acids and other organic compounds, and some {{speculate}} that asteroid impacts may have seeded the early Earth with the chemicals necessary to initiate life, or {{may have even}} brought life itself to Earth (also see <b>panspermia).</b> In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies with meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine and related organic molecules) may have been formed on asteroids and comets in outer space.|$|E
25|$|<b>Panspermia</b> {{can be said}} to {{be either}} {{interstellar}} (between star systems) or interplanetary (between planets in the same star system); its transport mechanisms may include comets, radiation pressure and lithopanspermia (microorganisms embedded in rocks). Interplanetary transfer of nonliving material is well documented, as evidenced by meteorites of Martian origin found on Earth. Space probes may also be a viable transport mechanism for interplanetary cross-pollination in the Solar System or even beyond. However, space agencies have implemented planetary protection procedures {{to reduce the risk of}} planetary contamination, although, as recently discovered, some microorganisms, such as Tersicoccus phoenicis, may be resistant to procedures used in spacecraft assembly clean room facilities. In 2012, mathematician Edward Belbruno and astronomers Amaya Moro-Martín and Renu Malhotra proposed that gravitational low energy transfer of rocks among the young planets of stars in their birth cluster is commonplace, and not rare in the general galactic stellar population. Deliberate directed <b>panspermia</b> from space to seed Earth or sent from Earth to seed other planetary systems have also been proposed. One twist to the hypothesis by engineer Thomas Dehel (2006), proposes that plasmoid magnetic fields ejected from the magnetosphere may move the few spores lifted from the Earth's atmosphere with sufficient speed to cross interstellar space to other systems before the spores can be destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The German {{physicist}} Claudius Gros has proposed, {{that the}} technology developed by the Breakthrough Starshot initiative may be utilized in a second step to establish a biosphere of unicellular microbes on otherwise only transiently habitable exoplanets. The aim of this initiative, the Genesis project, would be to fast forward evolution to a stage equivalent of the precambrian period on earth. Gros argues, that the Genesis project would be realizable within 50-100 year, using low-weight probes equipped with a miniaturized gene laboratory for the in situ synthesis of the microbes. The Genesis project extends directed <b>panspermia</b> to eukaryotic life.|$|E
25|$|The Tanpopo {{mission is}} an orbital {{astrobiology}} experiment by Japan {{that is currently}} investigating the possible interplanetary transfer of life, organic compounds, and possible terrestrial particles in low Earth orbit. The Tanpopo experiment is taking place at the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of Kibo module of the International Space Station. The mission will collect cosmic dusts and other particles for three years by using an ultra-low density silica gel called aerogel. The purpose is to assess the <b>panspermia</b> hypothesis {{and the possibility of}} natural interplanetary transport of life and its precursors. Some of these aerogels will be replaced every one or two years through 2018. Sample collection began in May 2015, and the first samples will be returned to Earth in mid-2016.|$|E
25|$|BIOPAN is a {{multi-user}} experimental facility {{installed on}} the external surface of the Russian Foton descent capsule. Experiments developed for BIOPAN are designed to investigate {{the effect of the}} space environment on biological material after exposure between 13 and 17 days. The experiments in BIOPAN are exposed to solar and cosmic radiation, the space vacuum and weightlessness, or a selection thereof. Of the 6 missions flown so far on BIOPAN between 1992 and 2007, dozens of experiments were conducted, and some analyzed the likelihood of <b>panspermia.</b> Some bacteria, lichens (Xanthoria elegans, Rhizocarpon geographicum and their mycobiont cultures, the black Antarctic microfungi Cryomyces minteri and Cryomyces antarcticus), spores, and even one animal (tardigrades) were found to have survived the harsh outer space environment and cosmic radiation.|$|E
25|$|Most earlier Muse songs lyrically {{dealt with}} introspective themes, {{including}} relationships, social alienation, and difficulties they had encountered {{while trying to}} establish themselves in their hometown. However, with the band's progress, their song concepts have become more ambitious, addressing {{issues such as the}} fear of the evolution of technology in their Origin of Symmetry (2001) album. They deal mainly with the apocalypse in Absolution (2003) and with catastrophic war in Black Holes and Revelations (2006). The Resistance (2009) focused on themes of government oppression, uprising, love, and <b>panspermia.</b> The album itself was mainly inspired by Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. Their sixth studio album, The 2nd Law (2012) relates to economics, thermodynamics, and apocalyptic themes. Their latest album, Drones (2015) is a concept album that uses autonomous killing drones as a metaphor for brainwashing and loss of empathy.|$|E
25|$|Planetary {{habitability}} is {{the measure}} of a planet's or a natural satellite's potential to have habitable environments hospitable to life, or its ability to generate life endogenously. A planet in the habitable zone has no guarantee of actually being habitable, and habitable environments {{do not need to}} contain life. Life may develop directly on a planet or satellite or be transferred to it from another body, a hypothetical process known as <b>panspermia.</b> As the existence of life beyond Earth is unknown, planetary habitability is largely an extrapolation of conditions on Earth and the characteristics of the Sun and Solar System which appear favorable to life's flourishing—in particular those factors that have sustained complex, multicellular organisms and not just simpler, unicellular creatures. Research and theory in this regard is a component of planetary science and the emerging discipline of astrobiology.|$|E
25|$|Wallis and Wickramasinghe {{argued in}} 2004 that the {{transport}} of individual bacteria or clumps of bacteria, is overwhelmingly more important than lithopanspermia in terms of numbers of microbes transferred, even accounting for the death rate of unprotected bacteria in transit. Then {{it was found that}} isolated spores of B. subtilis were killed by several orders of magnitude if exposed to the full space environment for a mere few seconds. These results clearly negate the original <b>panspermia</b> hypothesis, which requires single spores as space travelers accelerated by the radiation pressure of the Sun, requiring many years to travel between the planets. However, if shielded against solar UV, spores of Bacillus subtilis were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years, especially if embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites). The data support the likelihood of interplanetary transfer of microorganisms within meteorites, the so-called lithopanspermia hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} {{explanation for}} life's hypothetical existence on Titan has been proposed: if life {{were to be}} found on Titan, it could have originated from Earth in a process called <b>panspermia.</b> It is theorized that large asteroid and cometary impacts on Earth's surface have caused {{hundreds of millions of}} fragments of microbe-laden rock to escape Earth's gravity. Calculations indicate that a number of these would encounter many of the bodies in the Solar System, including Titan. On the other hand, Jonathan Lunine has argued that any living things in Titan's cryogenic hydrocarbon lakes would need to be so different chemically from Earth life {{that it would not be}} possible for one to be the ancestor of the other. In Lunine's view, presence of organisms in Titan's lakes would mean a second, independent origin of life within the Solar System, implying that life has a high probability of emerging on habitable worlds throughout the cosmos.|$|E

The idea that it is simply too implausible for life to have evolved is often wrongly encapsulated with a quotation that the [...] "probability of life originating on Earth is no greater than the chance that a hurricane, sweeping through a scrapyard, would have the luck to assemble a Boeing 747"—a claim attributed to astrophysicist Fred Hoyle and known as Hoyle's fallacy.
