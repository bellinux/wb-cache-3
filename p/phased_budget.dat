During the fifth and sixth annual reporting periods (8 / 3 / 98 - 8 / 2 / 00) covered by this report, work continued on interpretation of the cross well seismic data to create porosity and permeability profiles which were distributed into the reservoir geostatistically. The initial interwell seismic CO{sub 2 } monitor survey was conducted, the acquired data processed and interpretation started. Only limited well work and facility construction was conducted in the project area. The CO{sub 2 } injection initiated in October 1997 was continued, although the operator had to modify the operating plan in response to low injection rates, well performance and changes in CO{sub 2 } supply. CO{sub 2 } injection was focused in a smaller area to increase the reservoir processing rate.

The principle Task in <b>Budget</b> <b>Phase</b> II included in this report is Field Demonstration. Completion of these tasks has enabled an optimum carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) flood project to be designed, economically evaluated, and implemented in the field. Field implementation of the project commenced during late 1995, with actual CO{sub 2 } injection scheduled for start-up in mid-July, 1996. The current project has focused on reducing initial investment cost by utilizing horizontal injection wells and concentrating the project in the best productivity area of the field. An innovative CO{sub 2 } purchase agreement (no take-or-pay provisions, CO{sub 2 } purchase price tied to West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price) and gas recycle agreements (expensing costs as opposed to a large upfront capital investment for compression) were negotiated to further improve the project economics. The Grayburg-San Andres section had previously been divided into multiple zones based on the core study and gamma ray markers that correlate wells within the Unit. Each zone was mapped as continuous across the field. Previous core studies concluded that the reservoir quality in the South Cowden Unit (SCU) is controlled primarily by the distribution of a bioturbated and diagenetically-altered rock type with a distinctive {open_quotes}chaotic{close_quotes} texture.

5|$|While HBO {{entertainment}} president Carolyn Strauss felt Carnivàle {{had come}} to a natural end with its second season and gave this as the network's explanation for not renewing Carnivàle, it was reported HBO president Chris Albrecht had originally wanted to conclude the second season of Carnivàle with a satisfying and close-ended confrontation between Brother Justin and Ben. Albrecht allegedly preferred a definite demise of Brother Justin to a cliffhanger, but show creator Daniel Knauf stated Albrecht might have been misquoted. According to Knauf, Albrecht had wished in preproduction discussions to conclude season 2 with a fight between Brother Justin and Ben, which had always been Knauf's intention. HBO had then approved the open ending by greenlighting the final scene in the writing <b>phase,</b> <b>budgeting</b> the filming including the final shot, and owning the rights of the final cut of all episodes. There was never a plan to cancel Carnivàle prematurely, and HBO had only decided the cancellation shortly before their announcement.

The Handbook is {{one of a series of}} publications that address the integration of social dimensions into Bank operations. The Handbook has nine chapters. Chapter 1 summarizes the Bank’s Policy, introduces the concept of resettlement losses, reviews likely resettlement effects in different project types, introduces the project cycle, and addresses some common questions in planning land acquisition and resettlement. Chapter 2 situates resettlement planning in the context of the Bank’s project cycle. It advises on the contents of full and short resettlement plans, and when to use each format. Checklists highlight the actions to be taken for resettlement at each stage of the project cycle. Chapter 3 elaborates upon key resettlement planning concepts, including the policy framework, entitlements, planning resettlement for vulnerable groups, social preparation <b>phases,</b> <b>budgets,</b> and time lines. Chapter 4 identifies opportunities for consultation with stakeholders during resettlement planning and implementation, especially with people affected.
