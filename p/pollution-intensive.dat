Theoretically, by changing your value of R, analysts {{will be able}} to calculate the expected effect on economic activity. According to the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, this equation shows that environmental regulations and economic activity are negatively correlated, because regulations raise the cost of key inputs to goods with <b>pollution-intensive</b> productions and reduce jurisdictions' comparative advantage in these goods. This lack of comparative advantage causes firms to move to countries with lower environmental standards, decreasing Y.|$|E

Since making these policy changes India has seen an increase in GDP growth rates at 7% annually.

There is hope that as income growth increase, {{there would be a}} positive long run effect on the environment as consumer demand shifts towards relatively cleaner goods - this shift would cause <b>pollution-intensive</b> goods to fall, potentially reducing pollution emissions. India, as well as many developing countries, have been experiencing rapid economic development once adopting more liberal economic policies.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{develops}} a simple model to investigate linkages between trade and environmental policy. In {{the case of}} purely local pollution, trade liberalization without constraints on environmental policy induces a non-cooperative game between countries in pollution policy. Without any agreement on environmental policy, trade negotiations are unlikely {{to lead to a}} point on the Pareto frontier. When pollution is global, countries may be expected to disagree on linkages between trade agreements and environmental agreements. Countries importing <b>pollution-intensive</b> goods have an incentive to try to link trade agreements with environmental agreements, while countries exporting <b>pollution-intensive</b> goods have an incentive to try to obtain a binding com-mitment to free trade prior to negotiations over global pollution. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a firm-strategy perspective {{to the global}} combat against environmental pollution. We find that U.

S. firms from LWCs are in more <b>pollution-intensive</b> industries; U. S. plants also shift production to less <b>pollution-intensive</b> industries and spend less on pollution abatement when their parent firm imports more from LWCs. The negative impact of LWC imports on toxic emissions is stronger for U. S. plants located in counties with more powerful institutions, but weaker for more-capable U. S. plants and firms. These results highlight the role of local institutions and firm capabilities in explaining firms’ choice of offshoring and environmental strategy...|$|E
40|$|Dean and Lovely's chapter {{makes an}} {{important}} and interesting contribution {{to our understanding of}} the relationship between international trade and pollution. Many observers argue that developed countries, such as the United States, have improved their environments in recent decades largely by outsourcing <b>pollution-intensive</b> production to developing countries, such as China. 1 If that is the case, U. S. imports and Chinese exports should be increasingly composed of <b>pollution-intensive</b> goods. Economists have now refuted that idea, from the U. S. perspective, by showing that the composition of U. S. imports has become less <b>pollution-intensive</b> over time, not more. 2 Dean and Lovely are the first I know of to examine the converse. They show that the composition of exports from China has been shifting towards cleaner goods, not dirtier. The result nicely complements existing evidence from the U. S. perspective, and is therefore both important and believable. However, the analysis contains two unavoidable biases that, unfortunately, work in favor of that result, making the composition of China's exports appear spuriously cleaner. Dean and Lovely acknowledge both biases clearly in their chapter, and explain convincingly that they have exhausted all possibilities for ameliorating those biases given the available data. It is therefore worth taking a few moments here to demonstrate with the U. S. data just how large those biases can be. The first bias involves industry aggregation. Dean and Lovely calculate emissions intensities (pollution per thousand Yuan of output) for each of 33 sectors, listed in their appendix table A 1. They then conduct a counterfactual thought experiment...|$|E

40|$|Total {{pollution}} {{emitted by}} U. S. manufacturers declined {{over the past}} 30 years by about 60 percent, even though real manufacturing output increased 70 percent. This improvement must result {{from a combination of}} two trends: (1) changes in production or abatement processes ("technology"); or (2) changes in the mix of goods manufactured in the United States, which itself may result from increased net imports of <b>pollution-intensive</b> goods ("international trade"). I first show that most of the decline in pollution from U. S. manufacturing has been the result of changing technology, rather than changes in the mix of goods produced, although the pace of that technology change has slowed over time. Second, I present evidence that increases in net imports of <b>pollution-intensive</b> goods are too small to explain more than about half of the pollution reductions from the changing mix of goods produced in the United States. Together, these two findings demonstrate that shifting polluting industries overseas has played at most a minor role in the cleanup of U. S. manufacturing. ...|$|E
40|$|The authors use {{new data}} from Brazil and Mexico to analyze {{relationships}} linking economic development, the size distribution of manufacturing plants, {{and exposure to}} industrial pollution. For lack of data, prior work in this field has been limited largely to water pollution and medium-size plants. This study examines air pollution and encompasses small plants (with 1 to 20 employees) as well as medium-size and large plants. Four main questions are addressed (with answers from plant-level data) : a) Are small plants more <b>pollution-intensive</b> than large facilities? Clearly, yes. b) Are there proportionately more small plants in low-income regions? The answer is yes, in thousands of Brazilian municipalities. Small plants dominate poor regions and are a relatively low source of employment in high-income areas. c) Is industry more <b>pollution-intensive</b> in low-income regions? In Brazil, yes. For each municipality, the authors estimate {{the share of the}} six most <b>pollution-intensive</b> ("dirty") sectors in total industrial activity. They find that the dirty-sector share declines continuously with increases in municipality income per capita. d) Do poor areas suffer more than wealthy areas from industrial air pollution? Paradoxically, no. The risk of mortality from industrial air pollution is much higher in the top two income deciles among Brazil's municipalities and the great majority of projected deaths is attributable to emissions from large plants. The scale of large-plant emissions dominates all other factors. Lower-income areas suffer much less from industrial air pollution in Brazil, despite the greater emissions-intensity of smaller plants and the prevalence of smaller plants in lower income areas.

40|$|Global {{sustainability}} {{is increasingly}} influenced by processes of industrialisation and urbanization in non-OECD countries, especially in Asia. Growth models suggest that developing economies and regions will become first relatively more resource- and <b>pollution-intensive,</b> before converging on more resource-efficient and low-pollution {{production and consumption}} patterns expressed in developed countries. Alternative less resource- and <b>pollution-intensive</b> growth models for latecomer countries promise social and economic benefits in the short- and long-term. Drawing on insights from system innovation research on long-run change in socio-technical systems, we discuss the potential role of ‘sustainability experiments’ to generate innovations that will constitute new ‘greener’ growth models. We observe {{a great number of}} technology-based initiatives that we characterize as sustainability experiments in East and South Asian countries. These experiments emerge {{in the context of the}} growth of new socio-technical regimes in key sectors, including energy, transport, manufacturing, food and the built environment. We set out a conceptual framework for assessing the role of experiments, and for evaluating how they link with and become anchored into alternative more sustainable regimes. In this paper we argue that sustainability experiments represent a significant new source of innovation and capability-formation, linked to global knowledge and technology flows, which could reshape emergent socio-technical regimes and so contribute to alternative development pathways in latecomer countries. We conclude by summarizing the six papers published in this Special Issue...|$|E

Increased state environmental stringency during times when similar industries located in other states are not undertaking sufficient abatement expenditures leads to a decrease in establishment size.

40|$|Industrial {{pollution}} {{has remained}} {{as one of}} the most daunting challenges for many regions around the world. Characterizing the determinants of industrial pollution should provide important management implications. Unfortunately, due to the absence of high-quality data, rather few studies have systematically examined the locational determinants using a geographical approach. This paper aimed to fill the gap by accessing the pollution source census dataset, which recorded the quantity of discharged wastes (waste water and solid waste) from 717 <b>pollution-intensive</b> firms within Huzhou City, China. Spatial exploratory analysis was applied to analyze the spatial dependency and local clusters of waste emissions. Results demonstrated that waste emissions presented significantly positive autocorrelation in space. The high-high hotspots generally concentrated towards the city boundary, while the low-low clusters approached the Taihu Lake. Their locational determinants were identified by spatial regression. In particular, firms near the city boundary and county road were prone to discharge more wastes. Lower waste emissions were more likely to be observed from firms with high proximity to freight transfer stations or the Taihu Lake. Dense populous districts saw more likelihood of solid waste emissions. Firms in the neighborhood of rivers exhibited higher waste water emissions. Besides, the control variables (firm size, ownership, operation time and industrial type) also exerted significant influence. The present methodology can be applicable to other areas, and further inform the industrial pollution control practices. Our study advanced the knowledge of determinants of emissions from <b>pollution-intensive</b> firms in urban areas...|$|E

Our empirical estimates suggest that <b>pollution-intensive</b> plants are responding to environmental regulations; more importantly, we find that traditional parametric methods used in previous studies may dramatically understate the impact of more stringent regulations. © 2003 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|E

Using a unified empirical framework, we document that energy-intensive industries concentrate in low electricity price counties, labor-intensive industries avoid pro-union counties, and <b>pollution-intensive</b> industries locate in counties featuring relatively lax Clean Air Act regulation.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the dynamic relationship between CO 2 emissions {{and economic growth}} in Malaysia {{for the period of}} 1980 - 2004. The evidence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) is tested by including energy consumption, dirty export from Malaysia to China and dirty import from China to Malaysia based on the two and three-digit ISIC data which reflect <b>pollution-intensive</b> manufacturing. Using dirty industries for the period of 1980 - 2004, the existence of Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH) was tested by employing ARDL approach of cointegration and the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS). Six out of eight dirty industries are found to show statistically significant inverted U-shaped relationship between CO 2 emissions and economic growth, thus the EKC. Export from industries such as textile, wearing apparel and leather, manufacture of fabricated metal products and electrical machinery significantly increase CO 2 emissions in Malaysia. Most of the import coefficients are significant and positively related to CO 2 emissions, which is in contrast to the PHH. This strongly rejects the PHH for CO 2 emissions in Malaysia-China trade. There is no evidence that domestic production of <b>pollution-intensive</b> goods in Malaysia is being replaced by imports from China. Based on the analysis, Malaysia-China bilateral trade increases CO 2 emissions in Malaysia. There is therefore urgent need that electricity generation in Malaysia is from clean and sustainable sources.

40|$|Several {{previous}} studies have asked whether environmental controls imposed in the industrial economies are diverting investments in <b>pollution-intensive</b> activities off-shore. Broadly, these studies conclude that direct investment {{does not appear to}} be stimulated by such regulations, partly because the cost of emission controls is generally a tiny fraction of operating costs. Yet direct investment reflects only part of what may be happening to world production patterns. Technology transfers may occur with no simultaneous direct investments, and production may readily shift toward a different global distribution without either direct investment or technology transfer. The authors attempt a general test of the displacement hypothesis, developing time series estimates of manufacturing pollution intensity for a large sample of developed and developing countries between 1960 and 1988. Among their conclusions: As a result of shifts in industrial composition, total manufacturing emissions relative to GDP grow faster than GDP at lower levels of per capita income and slower than GDP at higher levels of income. This happens because manufacturing has a declining share of GDP at higher income levels, not because of any shift toward a cleaner mix of manufacturing activities. The more rapidly growing high-income countries have actually enjoyed negative growth in toxic intensity of their manufacturing mix. Stricter regulation of <b>pollution-intensive</b> production in the OECD countries appears to have led to significant locational displacement, with consequent acceleration of industrial pollution intensity in developing countries. The poorest economies seem to have the highest growth in toxic intensity. One cannot, of course, be certain of the causal connection. Pollution intensity has grown most rapidly in developing economies that are relatively closed to world market forces. Relatively closed, fast-growing economies experienced rapid structural transitions toward greater toxic intensity. The opposite seems to have been true for more open economies.

40|$|I address {{environmental}} issues {{of trade and}} investment liberalization. In the first chapter, I adopt a political-economy approach with special-interest groups cum electoral competition to endogenize environmental policy when voters have some equity ownership in polluting firms. The political-economy approach is motivated {{by the fact that}} the environment is a commonly cited topic in election competition, and environmental policy is jointly determined by the lobby behavior of environmentalists and industrialists. In the equilibrium, among all local producer groups, only the producer group which has the largest total private ownership makes its campaign contribution and becomes politically active. When there is no abatement opportunity, key determinants of the environmental policy are the transboundary nature of pollution, the level of pollution disutility, trade barriers, foreign environmental policy, the number of firms in the politically active producer group, and equity ownership structures of polluting firms. Results when there is an abatement opportunity with abatement costs failing on fixed costs or marginal costs are also shown. For both the developed country (the source country of international investments) and the developing country (the recipient country of international investments), environmental consequences of increased trade liberalization, increased inward (or outward) international investments, increased public ownership of <b>pollution-intensive</b> firms, and increased local equity participation requirement imposed on multinationals are presented. ^ In the second and third chapter, I adopt a framework featuring vertical connection between polluting sectors. This framework is motivated by prevailing industry characteristics such as chains of production and different vertical connections between upstream and downstream sectors in <b>pollution-intensive</b> industries like petrochemical and chemical industries. The key determinants of eco-dumping possibility in free-trade economies are whether the upstream market is segmented or integrated, types of vertical connections between upstream and downstream segments, the output ratio in vertically-related segments, and the difference in marginal profits in two segments. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three empirical studies {{on the effects of}} institutions, broadly conceived, on economic outcomes. The first study tests for evidence of causal relationships between provincial quality of governance and economic growth rates in reform-era China, 1985 – 2005. Improvements in governance are found to be significantly predicted by lagged economic growth rates, while economic growth is not found to be predicted by improvements in quality of governance. At the sectoral level, the effect of growth on governance is strongly driven by growth in the secondary sector, while governance is found to {{have a negative effect on}} growth in the primary sector, and a positive, but inconsistent, effect on growth in the tertiary sector. The second study tests the effect of historically-determined regional culture on regional variation in private entrepreneurship during China’s economic liberalization. Provincial success in imperial exams during the Ming dynasty (1368 – 1644) —which required many of the same personality traits as private entrepreneurship today—is used as a proxy for the historical distribution of these entrepreneurial traits, capturing regional variation in cultural values conducive to entrepreneurship. Controlling for a variety of geographic, economic, and policy factors, this historical cultural variation is shown to be significantly associated with entrepreneurial activity in modern times. The third study investigates the offshoring of <b>pollution-intensive</b> production as a response to increasingly stringent regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Using annual multi-regional input-output tables, and matched carbon dioxide emissions data, for 40 countries over the period 1995 – 2009, this study shows that observed increases in the greenhouse gas emissions embodied in imports in developed countries—previously linked to offshoring of <b>pollution-intensive</b> production by firms facing stricter domestic regulations—have instead been driven purely by overall growth in trade and increasing export production in relatively emissions-intensive developing countries. Changes in sector composition are, in fact, shown to have actually decreased emissions embodied in imports...|$|E

We characterize when an optimal environmental tax reform does not increase inequality, even if the tax system before the reform is optimal from a non-environmental point of view. If the tax system before the reform is calibrated to stylized data—and is thus non-optimal—we find {{that there is a}} large scope for inequality reduction, even if the government is restricted in its recycling options...|$|E
