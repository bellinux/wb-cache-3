40|$|Purpose. To ensure maximum {{production}} of electric power by photovoltaic vacilities, {{in addition to}} using highly efficient photovoltaic modules equipped with solar radiation concentrators must use a highly effective <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> system. This paper is inscribed to solving the problem of a highly efficient and economic <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> system development. Methodology. To solving the problem, we implemented three stages. On the first stage examines the dependence of electrical power from {{the intensity of the}} incident solar radiation. Based on this, the second stage is calculated the DC-DC converter resonant circuit and its working parameters, and developed circuit diagram of DC-DC converter. On the third stage, we carry out an analysis of <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> system with step up DC-DC converter working. Results. In this paper, we carry out the analysis of working efficiency for photovoltaic facility <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> system with step-up boost converter. The result of such analysis show that the efficiency of such system {{in a wide range of}} photovoltaic energy module illumination power is at 0. 92, whereas the efficiency of classic <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> systems does not exceed 0. 70. Achieved results allow designing a circuit scheme of a controlled bridge resonant step-up converter with digital control. Proposed scheme will ensure reliable operation, fast and accurate location point of maximum power and conversion efficiency up to 0. 96. Originality.

These auto parts were successively installed in the hull of a Soviet BTR-60P (also known as the GAZ-49) at different factories of the local automotive industry. The experimental prototype, designated T.A.B.-63, was equipped with two local-made SR-213 engines, two gearboxes, two transfer cases, two drive shafts, two <b>power</b> <b>take-offs,</b> brakes, hydraulic pumps, parts of the electric system, parts of the centralized tire air pressure control system {{and a number of}} support elements of the armoured hull.|$|E
50|$|The SM465 {{features}} dual {{provisions for}} <b>power</b> <b>take-offs.</b> The 1988-91 versions have an aluminum top with improved shift feel. The 1986 pickup truck versions utilize a hydraulic clutch release, replacing a mechanical linkage in older versions. A common wear {{factor in the}} form of abuse leads to having to manually hold the gear selector in third. There have been three different output shafts for pickup trucks. Early four-wheel drive was a short 10 spline, late 4WD was long 32 spline, and all two-wheel drives were 35 spline. Early 4WDs came mated to New Process 205 transfer cases. The 1981 and later versions came with a New Process 208 if not a 205. New Process 241 was used behind the 465 starting in 1989 when it replaced the New Process 208 in the V-series trucks. The 465 was the only manual transmission available for V-series trucks (1987-1991).|$|E
50|$|Experimental <b>power</b> <b>take-offs</b> {{were tried}} {{as early as}} 1878, and various {{homemade}} versions arose over the subsequent decades. International Harvester Company (IHC) was first to market with a PTO on a production tractor, with its model 8-16, introduced in 1918. Edward A. Johnston, an IHC engineer, had been impressed by a homemade PTO that he saw in France about a decade before, improvised by a French farmer and mechanic surnamed Gougis. He and his IHC colleagues incorporated the idea into the 8-16, and designed a family of implements {{to take advantage of}} the feature. IHC was not alone in the market for long, as within a year PTOs were appearing on other production tractors, such as some Case models. In 1920, IHC offered the PTO option on their 15-30 tractor, and it was the first PTO-equipped tractor to be submitted for a Nebraska tractor test. The PTO was a competitive advantage for IHC in the 1920s, and other companies eventually caught up with PTO implementation.|$|E

The CJ-2s, also known as [...] "AgriJeeps," [...] were the second generation prototype for the first production civilian Jeep, and were used solely for testing purposes. It was directly based on the military Willys MB, using the same Willys Go Devil engine, but stripped of all military features, particularly the blackout lighting. They had tailgates, <b>power</b> <b>take-offs</b> (PTO's), engine governors ($28.65), column-shift T90 manual transmissions, 5.38 gears, 2.43:1 low-range transfer cases, and driver's-side tool indentations.

50|$|In 2000, Jankel began {{designing}} a Long Range Patrol Vehicle (LRPV) {{to provide a}} capable and reliable patrolling platform. The Land Cruiser 79 chassis base was chosen as it is: common in most countries worldwide; not overly reliant on electronic management systems; mechanical components are of a basic design, enabling field repairs with standard automotive parts; a high-chassis weight loading capability; resulting in a vehicle which could be sustained in-field over long periods in remote areas, with limited or no support. Designed for patrol missions, internal security, reconnaissance and border patrol forces, it was field tested in the UK and Jordan, and first produced from 2005. The Al-Thalab can in base form accommodate up to four crew members, 1700 kg of equipment, and comes equipped with three firing bases, two base stations for radios and various <b>power</b> <b>take-offs.</b> There are options for: two stretchers in the rear for medical evacuation; medium range (1500 km) and commando variants.

In 2004 the Jordanian Army made its first order, taking initial deliveries from 2006, and now has over 200 units. The Armed Forces of Mauritania have been operating Al-Thalab LRPV since 2006. In 2016 British special forces were seen using the Al-Thalab in Syria.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a full-length external-fuel thermionic converter for in-pile testing is described. The development program includes out-of-pile performance testing of the fully fueled-converter, using RF-induction heating, before its installation in the in-pile test capsule. The external-fuel converter is cylindrical in shape, and consists of an inner, centrally cooled collector, and an outer emitter surrounded by nuclear fuel. The term full-length denotes that the converter is long enough to extend over the full height of the reactor core. Thus, the converter is not a scaled-down test device, but a full-scale fuel element of the thermionic reactor. The external-fuel converter concept permits {{a number of different}} design options, particularly with respect to the fuel composition and shape, and the collector cooling arrangement. The converter described was developed for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and is based on their concept for a thermionic reactor with uninsulated collector cooling as previously described. The converter is double-ended, with through-flow cooling, and with ceramic seals and emitter and collector <b>power</b> <b>take-offs</b> at both ends. The design uses a revolver-shaped tungsten emitter body, with the central emitter hole surrounded by six peripheral fuel holes loaded with cylindrical UO 2 pellets...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} fix-referenced and self-referenced wave energy converters and a comparison of their corresponding wave energy conversion capacities from real seas. For conducting the comparisons, two popular wave energy converters, point absorber and oscillating water column, and their power conversion capacities in the fixed-referenced and self-referenced forms have been numerically studied and compared. In the numerical models, the device’s power extractions from seas are maximized using the correspondingly optimized <b>power</b> <b>take-offs</b> in different sea states, thus their power conversion capacities can be calculated and compared. From the comparisons and analyses, it is shown that the energy conversion capacities of the self-referenced devices can be significantly increased if the motions of the device itself can be utilized for wave energy conversion; and the self-referenced devices can be possibly designed to be compliant in long waves, which {{could be a very}} beneficial factor for device survivability in the extreme wave conditions (normally long waves). In this regards, the self-referenced WECs (wave energy converters) may be better options in terms of wave energy conversion from the targeted waves in seas (frequently the most occurred), {{and in terms of the}} device survivability, especially in the extreme waves when compared to the fix-referenced counterparts...|$|E
40|$|Farm {{injuries}} {{have long}} been recognized as an im-portant health problem encountered by rural physicians. 1 – 3 These injuries are especially notable be-cause of their frequency, their patterns of recurrence 4 – 6 and the severe trauma that often results (unpublished data). In this article we analyse agri-cultural injuries occurring during the harvest season in Canada and {{provide an overview of}} the harvest-related injuries resulting in death or admission to hospital, as well as problems treated in the outpatient setting. Methods The data for this study were re-trieved from existing registries that form part of the Canadian Agricul-tural Injury Surveillance Program: the Canadian registry of fatal farm injuries (for 1991 – 1995), 7 the On-tario registry of injuries caused by farm machinery and resulting in ad-mission to hospital (for 1985 – 1994) 8 and data from the Manitoba De-partment of Labour database (for 1994 – 1996) for a sample of physi-cian clinics in Manitoba. For farm injuries resulting in death or admission to hospital, we defined “harvest-related injuries ” as those involving the most common agents of acute traumatic injury associated with the har-vest (i. e., tractors, <b>power</b> <b>take-offs,</b> balers, combines and harvesters, grain augers, conveyers and elevators, and farm wagons) and occurring in the months of July to November inclusive. From the data provided in the reg-istries, we could not identify all injuries related to har-vest tasks, so we had to limit our analysis to injuries caused by certain types of farm machinery. Because of differences in coding for the dif-ferent registries, a slightly differ-ent definition was used for outpa-tient cases: all injuries resulting from agricultural activities be-tween July and November. Our intention was to provide examples of the types and patterns of harvest injury and the specific diagnoses 9 that are likely to be ob-served in various clinical situa-tions. Our approach was therefore descriptive...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} model that will integrate multiple buoys to a <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> hub. The model will be derived using a time domain analysis and will consider the hydraulic coupling of the buoys and the <b>power</b> <b>take-off.</b> The derived model is reproduced in MATLAB in order to run simulations. This will give possibility to conduct a parameter study and evaluate the performance of the system. The buoy simulation model is provided by Wave 4 Power (W 4 P). It consists of a floater that is rigidly connected to a fully submerged vertical (acceleration) tube open at both ends. The tube contains a piston whose motion relative to the floater-tube system drives a <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> mechanism. The <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> model is provided by Ocean Harvesting Technologies AB (OHT). It comprises a mechanical gearbox and a gravity accumulator. The system is utilized to transform the irregular wave energy into a smooth electrical power output. OHT's simulation model needs to be extended with a hydraulic motor at the input shaft. There are control features in both systems, that need to be connected and synchronized with each other. Another major goal within the thesis is to test different online control techniques. A simple control strategy to optimize power capture is called sea-state tuning and it can be achieved by using a mechanical gearbox with several discrete gear ratios or with a variable displacement pump. The gear ratio of the gear box can be regulated according to a 2 D look up table based on the average wave amplitude and frequency over a defined time frame. The OHT <b>power</b> <b>take-off</b> utilizes a control strategy, called spill function, to limit the excess power capture and keep the weight accumulator within a span by disengaging the input shaft from the <b>power</b> <b>take-off.</b> This is to be modified to implement power limitation with regulation of the gear ratio of the gearbox. + 4673629078...|$|R
40|$|A l/ 4 -scale {{dynamically}} similar {{model of}} the XFV- 1 airplane has been flown in the Ames 40 - by 80 -foot wind tunnel, using the trailing flight-cable technique. This investigation was devoted to establishing the flight characteristics of the model in forward flight from hovering to wing stall, and in yawed flight (wing span alined with the relative wind) from hovering to the maximum speed at which controlled flight could be maintained. Landings, take-offs, and hovering characteristics in flights {{close to the ground}} were also investigated [...] Since the remote control system for the model was rather complicated and provided artificial damping about the pitch, roll, and yaw axes, sufficient data from the control-system calibration tests are included in this report to specify the performance of the control system in relation to both the model flight tests and the design of an automatic control system for the full-scale airplane. The model in hovering flight appeared to be neutrally stable. The response of the model to the controls was very rapid, and it was always necessary to provide some amount of artificial damping to maintain control. The model could be landed with little difficulty by hovering approximately a foot above the floor and then cutting the <b>power.</b> <b>Take-offs</b> were more difficult to perform, primarily because the rate of change in power to the model motors was limited by the characteristics of the available power source. The model was,capable of controlled yawed flight at translational velocities up to and including 20 feet per second. The effectiveness of the controls decreased with increasing speed, however, and at 25 fps control in pitch, and probably roll, was lost completely. The model was flown in controlled forward flight from hovering up to 70 fps. During these flights the model appeared to be more difficult to control in yaw than it was in pitch or roll. The flights of the model were recorded by motion picture cameras. These motion pictures are available on loan from NACA Headquarters as a film supplement to this report...|$|E
40|$|The {{wave energy}} {{industry}} has had difficulty maintaining {{the rate of}} progress seen during the mid-portion of the last decade. To rectify this deceleration of progress, the reasons must be understood. Major obstacles {{to the success of}} wave energy (might) include: • Reliability of components, especially <b>power</b> <b>take-offs</b> • Survivability of the systems • Complexities and costs in the development-to-market cycle • Uncertainties in industrial scalability These obstacles have combined to limit the progress made in wave energy: in particular, the conceptual shortcomings associated with cost- and time-sensitive development and an underestimation of the operational challenge of the ocean environment. The WETFEET (Wave Energy Transition to Future by Evolution of Engineering Technology, www. wetfeet. eu) project was conceived to provide answers to technology-related challenges so that the gap between promising results and the necessary engineering knowledge can be closed. This is to bine achieved with ‘breakthrough' items, which may be components, systems and processes or intellectual property. One of the principal breakthrough areas addressed by the WETFEET project is array interaction and mooring. This two-year study is a collaboration between partners representing higher education and research institutes and industry and it will offer interesting insights and results throughout its project life cycle. The move from prototype or demonstrator deployment of wave energy converters (WECs) to operational devices requires the use of farms of WECs to generate enough energy to be economically viable. The need to reduce costs further drives the design of arrays to share moorings and/or electrical connections. The choice of mooring and connection type does not just affect cost; array geometry will affect the amount of energy generated, O&M viability, hydrodynamic response and therefore survivability, network safety and reliability. The first outcome of the study will be the development of an assessment methodology that will allow the technical and economic performances of configuration geometries to be compared. This methodology will be applied to both rigid and non-rigid mooring strategies. A rigid mooring configuration would comprise several WECs attached to a rigid frame that is in turn moored to the sea bed, whereas in a non-rigid mooring configuration, the WECs would be slack-moored {{to each other and to}} the sea bed. The most promising configurations will be studied in the latter half of the project in both numerical simulations and physical model teststo determine the mooring loads and the natural responses of the different configurations. The results of these later tests will be available to coincide with ICOE 2018 thus giving a follow-up on one aspect of a major Horizon 2020 project...|$|E
