50|$|There is {{a strong}} tonal {{relationship}} between the <b>preludes</b> that suggests that the published order of the <b>preludes</b> is not arbitrary. For example, the first three <b>preludes</b> in the first book (Danseuses de Delphes, Voiles, and Le Vent dans la Plaine) revolve around the key of B. In these first three <b>preludes,</b> allusions to the key of B disappear and reappear, yet {{a strong sense of}} fluidity and connection between the <b>preludes</b> is still maintained.|$|R

5|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Solaris {{features}} Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale <b>prelude</b> for organ, Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV 639, played by Leonid Roizman, and an electronic score by Eduard Artemyev. The <b>prelude</b> {{is the central}} musical theme of Solaris. Tarkovsky initially wanted the film to be devoid of music and asked composer Artemyev to orchestrate ambient sounds as a musical score. The latter proposed subtly introducing orchestral music. In counterpoint to classical music as Earth's theme is fluid electronic music as the theme for the planet Solaris. The character of Hari has her own subtheme, a cantus firmus based upon J. S. Bach's music featuring Artemyev's composition atop it; it is heard at Hari's death and at story's end.|$|E
