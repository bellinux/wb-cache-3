25|$|Another issue {{concerned}} the three areas {{of foreign policy}} that <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> been focusing on during the final months of his term: Iran's nuclear development, North Korea's nuclear arsenal, and the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. In all three cases, a diplomatic structure had already been established, {{although some of the}} Bush Administration's goals might differ from those Obama would adopt as president.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 presidential election, Obama {{strongly}} {{criticized the}} Iraq War, and Obama withdrew {{the vast majority}} of U.S. soldiers in Iraq by late 2011. On taking office, Obama announced that U.S. combat forces would leave Iraq by August 2010, with 35,000–50,000 American soldiers remaining in Iraq as advisers and trainers, down from the roughly 150,000 American soldiers in Iraq in early 2009. In 2008, <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> signed the U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, in which the United States committed to withdrawing all forces by late 2011. Obama attempted to convince Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to allow U.S. soldiers to stay past 2011, but the large presence of American soldiers was unpopular with most Iraqis. By late-December 2011, only 150 American soldiers remained to serve at the US embassy. However, in 2014, the U.S. began a campaign against ISIL, an Islamic extremist terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria that grew dramatically after the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers from Iraq and the start of the Syrian Civil War. By June 2015, there were about 3500 American soldiers in Iraq serving as advisers to anti-ISIL forces in the Iraqi Civil War, and Obama left office with roughly 5,262 U.S. soldiers in Iraq and 503 of them in Syria.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{the status}} of Jerusalem specifically, <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> deemed Congress' role as merely [...] "advisory", stating that it [...] "impermissibly interferes with the President's {{constitutional}} authority". The U.S. Constitution reserves the conduct of foreign policy to the President; resolutions of Congress, {{such as the ones}} found in the Authorization Act of 2003 that included the Jerusalem Embassy Act's provisions, makes the arguments in favor of legislating foreign policy from Congress extremely problematic if not arguably invalid for that Constitutional reason.|$|E
2500|$|The New York District Court {{disagreed}} with the government's arguments and denied its motion.

2500|$|While <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> {{always been}} {{on record as}} {{opposing}} the legal recognition of same-sex marriages, the 2004 Republican campaign strategy was to focus on [...] "value issues" [...] such as a Federal Marriage Amendment, that would prohibit same-sex couples from obtaining any legal recognition.

2500|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, {{it was clear}} {{that one of the most}} {{important}} items on the domestic agenda for the President was to pass the Brady Bill.

2500|$|The Democrats' stated {{motivation}} {{was what they}} saw as an expansion of filibustering by Republicans during the Obama administration, especially with respect to nominations for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Republicans had asserted that the D.C. Circuit was underworked and cited a need to cut costs by reducing the number of judges. Democrats responded that Republicans had not raised these concerns earlier, when <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> made nominations to the court, and argued that the size of the court needed to be maintained because of the complexity of the cases it hears. Senate Democrats who supported the [...] "nuclear option" [...] also did so out of frustration with filibusters of executive branch nominees for agencies such as the Federal Housing Finance Agency.|$|E
2500|$|Obama has {{encouraged}} Democrats {{to reach out}} to evangelicals and other church-going people, saying, [...] "if we truly hope to speak to people where they’re at – to communicate our hopes and values in a way that’s relevant to their own – we cannot abandon the field of religious discourse." [...] He supports {{separation of church and state}} and contends that: [...] "I also think that we are under obligation in public life to translate our religious values into moral terms that all people can share, including those who are not believers. And that is how our democracy’s functioning, will continue to function. That’s what the founding fathers intended." [...] In July 2008, Obama said that if elected president he would expand the delivery of social services through churches and other religious organizations, vowing to achieve what he said <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> fallen short on.|$|E

2500|$|The {{decision}} nonetheless {{has had a}} broad impact. It {{represented a}} check on the most extreme claims of executive power at the time. It also represented the Court's assertion of its own role in intervening in political questions, as the Court later did in Baker v. Carr and Powell v. McCormack. The Court also applied the Frankfurter-Jackson approach to analyzing Congress' legislative authorization of Presidential action in invalidating efforts by the Nixon administration to plant wiretaps without prior judicial approval, while citing it more generally in support of its decision to permit litigation against the President to proceed in Clinton v. Jones. The high court also relied on Youngstown in Medellín v. Texas, 06-984 (2008). In that case, <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> pressured the state of Texas to review the murder conviction of a Mexican citizen who had tortured and raped two teenage girls in 1993, arguing that a 2004 decision by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) required law enforcement authorities to tell the accused of his right under the Vienna Convention to notify Mexican diplomats of his detention. In a 6-to-3 decision, the Court held that ICJ rulings were not enforceable in the United States, and Bush's actions were unconstitutional. Quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube, Chief Justice John Roberts concluded, [...] "The president's authority to act, as with the exercise of any governmental power, 'must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On taking office, Obama {{called for}} a [...] "reset" [...] in {{relations}} with Russia, which had declined following the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. While <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> successfully pushed for NATO expansion into former Eastern bloc states, the early Obama era saw NATO put more of an emphasis on creating a long-term partnership with Russia. Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev worked together on a new treaty to reduce and monitor nuclear weapons, Russian accession to the World Trade Organization, and counterterrorism. On April 8, 2010, Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty, a major nuclear arms control agreement that reduced the nuclear weapons stockpiles of both countries and provided for a monitoring regime. In December 2010, the Senate ratified New START in a 71-26 vote, with 13 Republicans and all Democrats voting {{in favor of the}} treaty. In 2012, Russia joined the World Trade Organization and Obama normalized trade relations with Russia. However, US-Russia relations declined once Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency. Russia's intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea led to a strong condemnation by Obama and other Western leaders, who imposed sanctions on Russian leaders. The sanctions contributed to a Russian financial crisis. Some members of Congress from both parties also called for the US to arm Ukrainian forces, but Obama resisted becoming closely involved in the War in Donbass. In 2016, following several cybersecurity incidents, the Obama administration formally accused Russia of engaging in a campaign to undermine the 2016 election, and the administration imposed sanctions on some Russian-linked people and organizations.|$|E

[...] A [...] "sanitized version" [...] of the NIE in question was officially declassified on July 18, 2003, ten days after Libby's contact with Miller, and was presented at a White House background briefing on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq.
