Maloy region need a cargo port that???s connect this region to the other places with carrying a variety of natural resources. To create a port, first assignment is to make a several surveys. Which is area mapping, tidal, water level, wind and waves analysis and also soil investigation. All of this surveys must be done to make a plan well. The ship that will berth at the port is cargo ship that has a 40. 000 DWT so it needs 300 m length and 30 m wide. From the tidal and waves analysis, resulting the level for the port is 5 m above the sea level. The type for the port is jetty, it mean the water level that qualify for the ship is far from the coast line.

40|$|CIVINSThe Navy has {{traditionally}} used treated timber materials for fender systems for piers and wharves in Pearl Harbor. In recent years, {{the costs associated}} with the use of timber have escalated and the Navy has begun to use plastic piles at installations around the world to replace timber fender systems. Plastic fender systems are more expensive, but have greater energy absorption capabilities and are more resilient to environmental decay. To determine whether plastic piles are a cost saving alternative to treated timber, the present study compiled and evaluated existing technical data, maintenance/ construction records and inspection reports from various Navy staff civil engineer offices and at the Navy Public Works Center Pearl Harbor (PWC). Since records at these various locations were not designed to present associated cost/ maintenance data in a format suitable for an economic analysis, field surveys of over 3 miles of waterfront in Pearl Harbor and interviews with staff civil engineers and wharf building branch managers at PWC were conducted to supplement existing historical data. Through the gathered data, the maintenance costs of timber <b>pile</b> <b>fenders</b> are estimated and compared to those of composite plastic piles using manufacturers' quotes and from reports compiled by the Navy Civil Engineering Laboratory (NCEL). For the expected life cycles of timber piles observed in Pearl Harbor this analysis shows the proposed plastic system to be more cost effective for shore facilities with remaining service lives of greater than ten years[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{air shaft}} deep {{foundation}} pit 6 {{is influenced by}} subgrade unbalance loading of highway 312, specifically its deep horizontal displacement of supporting piles and subgrade settlement of expressway 312 under unsymmetrical load effect. This paper carries out construction monitoring and numerical simulation analysis and gives a detailed study on the influenced factors of support structure deformation. Calculation results show that subgrade unsymmetrical load has a great influence on deep horizontal deformation of supporting piles. The maximum horizontal displacement at the bias side is about three times more than non-bias sideâ€™s; when the distance of subgrade to foundation pit {{is the same as}} the depth of excavation, the influence of subgrade on pit can be ignored; as the cohesion and internal friction angle increases, the horizontal displacement of <b>fender</b> <b>piles</b> decreases. However, enlarging the embedded depth of supporting piles has no significant influence on the stability of foundation pit...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} {{the port of}} Caldera, Costa Rica is discussed. The port was {{constructed}} in 1981. It has 3 berths. The most important cargo for the port are grains (import), and containers (mainly import). Ofthe other cargo, tuna is the most important. Not for its amount, {{but because of the}} waiting time for tuna ships and the time needed to discharge those ships. Two main problems are present at Caldera. The first is sedimentation. Haskoning has proposed a solution for this problem, namely extension of the present breakwater. The second problem is waiting time for the ships. Some container lines have excluded Caldera from their schedule because ofthose waiting times. As the total amount of cargo is expected to increase, there is need for a solution. This report consists ofthree parts. Part 1 contains a description ofthe present situation and expected changes. The problem definition and boundary conditions are discussed in Chapter 2. The environmental conditions are described in Chapter 3. To make an estimation ofthe future cargo growth, a correlation between Costa Rica's GDP and growth of cargo is made in Chapter 4. Given this cargo growth, an analysis of the expected ships is made in Chapter 5. These ships require adjustment ofthe present situation. In the first place, the port should meet the nautical requirements of those ships. Those requirements are determined in Chapter 6. In the second place the unloading of the vessels should not take to long. This may require new berths and equipment. This is discussed in Chapter 7 The requirements from Part 1 are used in Part 2. In Part 2 a future lay-out for the new port is made. First the existing plans are repeated and discussed briefly in Chapter 8. Most of those contain a new container terminal. This report prefers the installation of a new grain terminal. This would be less expensive and reduce the strain {{on the rest of the}} port. Furthermore the expected container vessels can be handled in the present harbour. Some adjustments will be necessary (Installation of cranes). The grain ships on the other hand are in need of a deeper berth. The expansion proposed by this report for 2010 and 2025 are shown in Chapter 9 In Part 2 the installation of a new grain terminal is proposed. In Part 3 this terminal is designed. First the loads on the terminal are determined in Chapter 10. In this chapter different fender systems are also discussed. Two alternatives ofthe terminal are designed. One with <b>pile</b> <b>fenders</b> and one with buckling fenders. In Chapter 11 those two alternatives are discussed. It is concluded that the force imposed on the structure due to earthquake loads is such that the jetty should also be able to withstand loads from the buckling fenders. Therefore, it is recommended to use buckling fenders. Finally in Chapter 12 the general conclusions and recommendations ofthis report are given. The main conclusion is the port can apply to future demand using fewer adjustments as those proposed until now. A new grain terminal combined with the installation of container cranes is enough for the demand of 2010 [...] Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
5000|$|On 19 October 1971, the {{drilling}} rig William Allpress was anchored three-quarters of a mile off the coast near Rustington. The weather was slowly deteriorating and the rig was awaiting a tow into Portsmouth Harbour. After three days the conditions had caused the crew to have no food or sleep and the five men aboard were all suffering from sea sickness and {{it was necessary for}} the men to be taken off the rig. The Watson-class lifeboat [...] was launched at 2.10 pm in south-westerly gale to a very heavy sea, torrential rain and poor visibility. Coxswain John Fox, after circling the rig to assess the situation, <b>piled</b> all his <b>fenders</b> into one large one, brought the life-boat starboard on to the rig enabling the five survivors to be pulled on board across the foredeck. The lifeboat then headed back to Shoreham. The rescue had taken three hours. John Fox was awarded an RNLI Bronze medal for his part in the service.|$|R
40|$|Traditional piling in {{the form}} of steel, {{concrete}} or timber is susceptible to hazards within harsh marine environments. The deterioration of wood, corrosion of steel and degradation of reinforced/prestressed concrete piles in deep foundations has led researchers to experiment with methods to overcome these problems. Composite material piles, such as fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) and structurally reinforced plastics (SRP), are a unique solution to the problems faced by traditional piling in marine environments. Their resistance to corrosion and long service life make them an economical and environmentally viable solution to traditional piling. Although a few manufacturers have begun to adopt some form of composite <b>piling</b> for <b>fender</b> applications, barriers remain that prevent their widespread use as load bearing piles. These barriers include the lack of specific driving and installation guidelines, limited full-scale geotechnical design data, long-term durability studies and in-depth environmental impact studies. To facilitate research in the aforementioned areas, this review paper details the historical use of composite piles, the structural and geotechnical design of several types of load bearing composite piles, the durability of piles, and, lastly, the construction and manufacturing processes involved. The findings show that there is a general consensus amongst researchers that fibre-reinforced piles (FRP) are structurally and geotechnically suitable for a range of load bearing applications, and that SRP piles, with adequate reinforcement, can potentially be used in deep foundations. More full-scale field research is still needed to develop sufficient driving guidelines, and durability tests emulating saline marine conditions should be carried out to assess the effectiveness of epoxies, and, lastly, reinforcing arrangements should be tested to prevent lateral deflection...|$|R
50|$|On Saturday 12 January 1895 the Peveril {{sustained}} damage whilst {{in the process}} of docking at Douglas.Under the command of Captain Hill, the Peveril had departed Liverpool on schedule bound for Douglas, but {{during the course of the}} passage she encountered severe weather in the form of a south-easterly Gale.Challenging conditions awaited the Peveril as she approached Douglas, and as a consequence of the wind direction coupled to a large swell in the harbour, the decision was made for the Peveril to dock at the Battery Pier as opposed to the Victoria Pier.Although it was low water Captain Hill then decided to proceed to Peel on the west coast of the Isle of Man so as to receive maximum shelter. As she was breaking away from the pier, the Peveril swung round against the pier and broke one of her propellers, so that she then had to be taken into the inner harbour at Douglas for shelter.However, as she again proceeded to break away from the Battery Pier she was involved in another mishap. Being less manoeuvrable because of her disabled propeller, she struck her stern against the pier, with such force that one of the plates on her stern was stove in and two of the <b>piles</b> of the <b>fender</b> of the pier were broken away by the impact.Finally the Peveril was positioned into the inner harbour, where she was moored at the North Quay. The damage sustained was promptly repaired and she was able to resume her schedule on Monday morning with only a minor delay.|$|R
40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} {{reinforcement}} causes continual degradation to the worldwide infrastructures {{and it has}} prompted the need for challenges to those involved with reinforced concrete structures. Recently, the use of fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) tubes as structurally integrated stay-in-place forms for concrete members, such as beams, columns, bridge piers, <b>piles</b> and <b>fender</b> <b>piles</b> has emerged as an innovative solution to the corrosion problem. In such integrated systems, the FRP tubes may act as a permanent form, often as a protective jacket for concrete, and especially as external reinforcement in the primary and secondary directions such as for confinement. Furthermore, the use of concrete-filled FRP tubes (CFFT) technique is predicated on performance attributes linked to their high strength-to-weight ratios, expand the service life of structures, enhance corrosion resistance, and potentially high durability. This dissertation evaluates the axial and flexural performances of reinforced CFFT through experimental and analytical investigations. The details description and {{the findings of the}} investigations are presented through seven articles. To fulfill the objectives of this research, an experimental program has been designed including pure compression tests (33 specimens), axial-eccentric load tests (4 specimens) and pure flexure tests (10 specimens). Experimental investigations of the behaviour of CFFT have generally been carried out without using internal longitudinal reinforcement. The CFFT system of this study consists basically of filament-wound glass FRP tubes filled with concrete and reinforced internally with steel or FRP bars. Five types of new FRP tubes have been used with different thicknesses and two different diameters, 152 and 213 mm. Pure compression tests have been conducted on 40 specimens with a total height ranging from 305 mm to 1520 mm. One of the main objectives of testing these specimens is to evaluate the design equations of the North American codes and design guidelines to predict the ultimate load capacities of reinforced and unreinforced short CFFT columns. In addition, the effect of three parameters and their interactions on the buckling behaviour were investigated for these specimens; namely, the FRP tube thickness, concrete compressive strength, and slenderness ratio. The effect of eccentric load on the behaviour of four CFFT specimens of diameters 152 mm and long 912 mm, has been evaluated using four different eccentricity values (15, 30, 45 and 60 mm). Based on the finding of experimental and theoretical investigation for the CFFT columns, a new confinement model is proposed for the confined concrete compressive strength of the CFFT cylinders. Also, the design equations are modified to accurately predict the ultimate and yield loads capacities of internally reinforced and unreinforced short CFFT columns. In addition, the theoretical analysis was utilized to correlate the slenderness ratio of the CFFT columns to various material characteristics and geometric properties of the FRP tubes and concrete. It was found that a slenderness ratio of 12 gave a safe value for the design purposes. However a more precise formula for the slenderness ratio was proposed to control the buckling mode of failure. Pure flexural tests have been conducted on 10 RCFFT and RC beams of a total length 2000 mm with constant diameter 213 mm. The test variables were the type of internal reinforcements (steel or GFRP bars), the FRP tube thickness, concrete compressive strength and the type of transverse reinforcements (spiral steel or FRP tubes). The influence of the considered variables on the flexural behaviour of the tested RCFFT beams is presented. A simplified analytical method is developed to predict the yield and resisting moments corresponding to the failure modes of the tested RCFFT beams. The analysis was conducted according to the equations derived from linear elastic analysis. This analysis was found to be acceptable for predicting the ultimate and yield moments capacities of the FRP or steel-RCFFT beams. In addition, an analytical investigation to examine the validity of the available design provisions for predicting the load-deflection response of CFFT is conducted. The effective moments of inertia of the tested beams are analyzed using the different available code, manuals and design guidelines equations. The results of the analysis are compared with the experimental values. It has been found that the predicted tension stiffening for steel or FRP-RCFFT beams using the conventional equations (steel or FRP-RC member) is underestimated and hence the predicted deflections are overestimated. Based on the experimental data obtained in this study, new proposed equations and a modified expression for the effective moment of inertia of a simply supported CFFT beams reinforced with steel or GFRP bars are introduced...|$|R
