The navies of the United States, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea took part. Because of the Kursk {{submarine}} disaster which had happened earlier that year, the Pacific Reach 2000 drills involved submarine rescue exercises, which Akishio performed in. This {{was the first time}} Japanese ships had taken <b>part</b> <b>in</b> a multilateral submarine rescue drill, although they had taken <b>part</b> <b>in</b> similar exercises bilaterally, with the US Navy. Japan's constitution places limits on their ability to perform collective-defence drills. Because of this, Japan joined the drills from a humanitarian standpoint, rather than a military one.|$|E

40|$|Let A be any set of {{positive}} integers and n ∈ N. A composition of n with <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> A is an ordered collection {{of one or}} more elements in A whose sum is n. A palindromic composition of n with <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> A is a composition of n with <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> A in which the summands are the same in the given or in reverse order. A Carlitz (palindromic) composition of n with <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> A is a (palindromic) composition of n with <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> A in which no adjacent parts are the same. In this paper, we study the generating functions for several counting problems for compositions, palindromic compositions, Carlitz compo-sitions, and Carlitz palindromic compositions with <b>parts</b> <b>in</b> A, respectively. Our theorems contain many previously known results as special cases, as well as many new results. We also prove some of our results using direct counting arguments.
