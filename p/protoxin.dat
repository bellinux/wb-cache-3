The metabolic profile and biotransformation of these <b>protoxins</b> by three enzymes, monoamine oxidase (MAO), cytochrome P 450, and heme peroxidases (myeloperoxidase and lactoperoxidase), were investigated and compared. The metabolite profile differed among the enzymes investigated. MAO and heme peroxidases activated these substances to toxic pyridinium and β-carbolinium species. MAO catalyzed the oxidation of MPTP to 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 2, 3 -dihydropyridinium cation (MPDP+), whereas heme peroxidases catalyzed the oxidation of MPDP+ to 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium (MPP+) and of 2 -methyltetrahydro-β-carboline to 2 -methyl- 3, 4 -dihydro-β-carbolinium cation (2 -Me- 3, 4 -DHβC+). These substances were inactivated by cytochrome P 450 2 D 6 through N-demethylation and aromatic hydroxylation (MPTP) and aromatic hydroxylation (2 -methyltetrahydro-β-carboline). In conclusion, the toxicological effects of these <b>protoxins</b> might result from a balance between the rate of their activation to toxic products (i. e., N-methylpyridinium-MPP+ and MPDP+- and N-methyl-β-carbolinium—βC+—) by MAO and heme peroxidases and the rate of inactivation (i. e., N-demethylation, aromatic hydroxylation) by cytochrome P 450 2 D 6...|$|R

The Cry 1 Ab and Cry 1 Ac toxins bound equally well over a range of toxin concentrations and times of incubation to a single protein of ca. 80 -kDa in immunoblots of larval membrane extracts from all of the colonies. This binding protein is essential for toxicity since a mutant Cry 1 Ac toxin known to be defective in binding and thus less toxic bound poorly to the 80 -kDa protein. This binding protein differed in size from the major aminopeptidase N antigens implicated in toxin binding in other insects. Binding of fluorescently labeled Cry 1 Ac or Cry 1 Ab toxin to larval sections was found at the tips of the brush border membrane prepared from the susceptible but not from any of the resistant P. interpunctella.

In semiquantitative binding studies with biotin-labelled toxins and intact brush border membrane vesicles of S. exigua, this domain III substitution appeared not to affect binding-site specificity. However, binding to a 200 -kDa protein by CryIA(b) in preparations of solubilized and blotted brush border membrane vesicle proteins was completely abolished by the domain III substitution. A reciprocal hybrid containing domains I and II of CryIC and domain III of CryIA(b) did bind to the 200 -kDa protein, confirming that domain III of CryIA(b) was essential for this reaction. These results show that domain III of CryIC protein {{plays an important role in}} the level of toxicity to S. exigua, that substitution of domain III may be a powerful tool to increase the repertoire of available active toxins for pest insects, and that domain III is involved in binding to gut epithelium membrane proteins of S. exigua...|$|R

The conditional phenotype could be transferred by cell mating to naturally acrystalliferous Bacillus cereus. In all such cases, a 29 -Md <b>protoxin</b> -encoding plasmid was transferred, but this plasmid alone was barely sufficient for <b>protoxin</b> synthesis. <b>Protoxin</b> production increased to detectable levels, but well below those of the parental donor strain, by simultaneous transfer of a 44 -Md <b>protoxin</b> -encoding plasmid.

In the present study, a simplified procedure was used for isolating and purifying toxin generated by the tryptic digestion of <b>protoxin</b> from B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki HD- 73. Characterization of this toxin showed that it {{is derived from the}} N-terminal half of the <b>protoxin</b> molecule. The toxin is insoluble at neutral pH values but is moderately soluble at alkaline values above pH 9. Application of several spectroscopic and theoretical procedures to the purified toxin showed that the protein is composed of approximately equal amounts of a α-helix, β-sheet and random coil structures. The tertiary structure of toxin was shown to be comprised of two primary domains; these domains correspond to the toxic and specificity (or binding) domains predicted from analysis of <b>protoxin</b> gene nucleotide sequences. Evidence was obtained that at least one additional domain is present as a structural component of the C-terminal specificity domain. Both the toxic moiety within the <b>protoxin</b> molecule and free toxin were found to be unusually resistant to unfolding by chemical denaturants and to proteolysis. In contrast, the C-terminal half of <b>protoxin</b> could be readily unfolded and was extremely susceptible to proteolytic digestion.

The DNA from the T 2 toxin varied in size from 100 to 300 base pairs, whereas the crystal and the solubilized <b>protoxin</b> contain 20 -kilobase DNA as the major DNA component.

There are several {{size classes of}} plasmids in this organism {{and the presence of}} one or more has been correlated with production of this protein, defined as a <b>protoxin.</b> DNA fragments of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki, obtained by EcoRI digestion, were cloned into the vector Charon 4 A. Recombinant phage were screened immunologically for the production of <b>protoxin.</b> Cells infected with one phage, C 4 K 6 c, produced antigen that was {{the same size as the}} <b>protoxin</b> and was toxic to Manduca sexta larvae. A 4. 6 -kilobase-pair (kbp) EcoRI fragment from C 4 K 6 c was subcloned into pBR 328 and in both orientations in pHV 33. Both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis containing these recombinant plasmids produced antigen that crossreacted with antibody directed against the <b>protoxin.</b> The various sized plasmids of B. thuringiensis were purified and only an EcoRI fragment from the 45 -kbp plasmid hybridized to phage C 4 K 6 c. One of the pHV 33 subclones, pSM 36, hybridized to the same size EcoRI/HindIII restriction fragments from plasmid or chromosomal DNA. The cloned EcoRI fragment contained a 0. 9 -kbp Pvu II fragment that was also present in chromosomal but not in plasmid digests. The original clone was therefore of chromosomal origin, although very similar or identical <b>protoxin</b> genes were present in both the 45 -kbp plasmid and the chromosome. Several acrystalliferous nontoxic mutants have been isolated that lacked the 45 -kbp plasmid and in some cases all plasmids. All of the mutants contained the chromosomal gene but did not produce <b>protoxin</b> antigen...|$|E
40|$|Susceptibility to the Cry 1 Ab <b>protoxin</b> and toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner) and {{activity}} of gut proteinases were assessed in both susceptible and Cry 1 Ab-selected colonies of European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner). Resistance {{in two different}} selected colonies was at least 6 - and 15 -fold for the Cry 1 Ab <b>protoxin</b> and 108 - and 484 -fold for the Cry 1 Ab toxin. Activities of trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like and elastase-like proteinases were variable among the colonies tested and not indicative of a major contribution to Cry 1 Ab resistance. Activation of the 130 -kDa Cry 1 Ab <b>protoxin</b> occurred rapidly in all colonies, with no apparent differences among colonies. In addition, there were no apparent changes in activated Cry 1 Ab processing, indicating that proteolytic degradation {{was not associated with}} resistance. These results suggest that mechanisms other than proteolytic activation of <b>protoxin</b> and toxin degradation, such as target site modification may be involved in the resistance to B. thuringiensis Cry 1 Ab in these O. nubilalis colonies...|$|E
40|$|Aerolysin is {{secreted}} as an inactive dimeric precursor by {{the bacterium}} Aeromonas hydrophila. Proteolytic cleavage within a mobile loop near the C terminus of the <b>protoxin</b> {{is required for}} oligomerization and channel formation. This loop contains the sequence KVRRAR 432, which should be recognized by mammalian proprotein convertases such as furin, PACE 4, and PC 5 / 6 A. Here we show that these three proteases cleave proaerolysin af-ter Arg- 432 in vitro, yielding active toxin. We also inves-tigated the potential role of these enzymes in the in vivo activation of the <b>protoxin.</b> We found that Chinese ham-ster ovary cells were able to convert the <b>protoxin</b> to aerolysin {{in the absence of}} exogenous proteases and that activation did not require internalization of the toxin. The furin inhibitor a 1 -antitrypsin Portland re...|$|E
40|$|Two of the Bacillus thuringiensis (B. t.) strains, israelensis and kurstaki, produce similar 130 kDa <b>protoxins</b> encoded by the crylVB and crylA(c) genes, respectively. The former encodes a toxin {{specific}} to dipteran larvae {{and the latter}} to lepidopteran insects. A putative insect specificity domain of cryl ti B was amplified by PCR and cloned into pUC 19 (pGI). This region was excised and exchanged with an analogous sequence in crylA(c) cloned in pKK 2233 to form pOSM. The chimeric gene was stable in Escherichia coli but bioassays showed little toxicity to Aedes aegypti or Aedes triseriatus mosquito larvae. Sequencing of the inserts in both plasmids was performed {{to determine if there}} had been an alteration in the sequence resulting in loss of toxicity an/or to verify that we had amplified and exchanged the correct domain for toxicity. We verified that 33 % of the insert contained no alterations. Toxicity may not have been seen due to the parental (pOSU 4202 - B. t. k. cryIA(c) in pKK 2233) losing toxicity. Honors CollegeThesis (B.

40|$|The {{expected}} {{increase in}} application of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in crop protection makes {{it necessary to}} anticipate the development of Bt-resistant insects. To safeguard the long-term use of Bt-based insecticides, we studied the mode of action of Bt crystal proteins. CryIA(b), CryIC and CryIE are all toxic to lepidoptera, but each protein has its own specificity profile. In order to identify regions in the proteins involved in insecticidal specificity, hybrids between the genes cryIA(b) cryIC and cryIE were generated. Plasmids were constructed carrying two truncated crystal protein genes. In vivo recombination between these genes resulted in hybrids encoding full-length 140 kDa <b>protoxins.</b> In this manner, sets of CryIA(b) -CryIE, CryIC-CryIE and CryIE-CryIC hybrid proteins were isolated. The analysis of the CryIC-CryIE hybrids showed that domain II is involved in receptor binding, but that domain II of CryIC is not sufficient for the high activity of this protein towards Spodoptera exigua and Mamestra brassicae. Biochemical evidence and insect toxicity assays indicate that all CryIA(b) -CryIE hybrids are malfolded and precipitate as insoluble aggregate...|$|R
40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is {{the most}} {{effective}} microbial control agent for controlling numerous species from different insect orders. All subspecies and strains of B. thuringiensis can produce a spore and a crystalline parasporal body. This crystal which contains proteinaceous <b>protoxins</b> is dissolved in the alkaline midgut, the resulting molecule is then cleaved and activated by proteolytic enzymes and acts as a toxin. An interesting aspect of this activation process is that variations in midgut pH and protease activity have been shown to account for the spectrum of some Bt proteins activity. Thus, an important factor that could be a determinant of toxin activity is the presence of proteases in the midgut microenvironment of susceptible insects. Reciprocally, any alteration in the midgut protease composition of the host can result in resistance to Bt. Here in this paper, we reviewed this processes in general and presented our assays to reveal whether resistance mechanism to Bt in Diamondback Moth larvae could be due to the function of the midgut proteases? We estimated LC 50 for both probable susceptible and resistant populations in laboratory and greenhouse tests. Then, the midgut protease activities of the B. thuringiensis in...|$|R
