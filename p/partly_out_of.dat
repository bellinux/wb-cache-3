5|$|In the Second World War, Great Britain granted conscientious-objection status {{not just}} to {{complete}} pacifists, but to those who objected to fighting in that particular war; this was done <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> genuine respect, but also to avoid the disgraceful and futile persecutions of conscientious objectors {{that occurred during the}} First World War.|$|E
5|$|Following the massacres, many Serbs from Glina and its {{surroundings}} fled to Serbia or were deported to Ustaše-controlled concentration camps. The NDH collapsed in May 1945, {{and the following}} year the Nuremberg trials judged that the persecution experienced by Serbs in the country was a crime of genocide. Local Serbs returned to Glina after the war, <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a desire to remain near the graves of their deceased family members, and lived peacefully alongside their Croat neighbours until {{the outbreak of the}} Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In early 1971, Rainbow played {{its first}} show, which {{consisted}} of two sets performed at Richmond Community College in Staten Island. After the show, the group discovered that there was already another band called Rainbow. They decided to drop the name, {{and came up with}} the name Wicked Lester, which Klein liked because it was unusual. While the decision to change the group's name came <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a desire to avoid any potential legal issues, it also reflected Klein and Eisen's desire to start playing more original compositions.|$|E

5|$|Though much of {{the mythology}} {{surrounding}} the patrol and the site has dissipated in the national consciousness since the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, World's View endures as a tourist attraction to this day. A campaign in the 1990s to dismantle the monument and remove the graves met with strong opposition from both local residents and the Department of National Museums and Monuments, {{partly because of the}} income it brings from visitors, and <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> respect for the site and the history surrounding it.|$|E
5|$|Abi {{discovers that}} Ian's {{restaurant}} {{is on fire}} and goes inside to find Jane in a corridor on the floor struggling to breathe. A pipe falls onto Abi, knocking her unconscious, but Max and Steven soon find her and drag her out. She is taken to hospital with Lauren by her side in the ambulance. At the hospital Abi tells Steven {{he is going to}} be a father. Steven declares his love for her and makes a promise that he will make their relationship work. Steven then goes into cardiac arrest and dies after being injured in the fire leaving Abi devastated. In an attempt to console Lauren but also <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> jealousy that Lauren is getting all the attention, Abi tries to tell Lauren about her pregnancy, but Lauren angrily mistakes this as gloating about her own abortion. Upset at the accusation, Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved Steven. Abi attends Steven's funeral as sole mourner and declares her love. Unable to cope with Steven's death, Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya in Devon, taking Steven's ashes with her. When Lauren finds out that Abi is leaving, she asks if she and Louie can come with her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} pre-Crisis continuity, Kathy Kane, a wealthy Gotham City heiress and former circus performer, decides {{to use her}} skills and resources to become a costumed crime-fighter. This is <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> altruism and partly to attract the romantic attentions of Batman. During the Silver Age of Comics, Batwoman guest-starred occasionally in Batman stories published from 1956 to 1964. While Batman wished for Kane to retire from crime-fighting due to the danger, she remained his ally, even when she temporarily became {{a new version of}} Catwoman. In 1961, Batwoman was joined by her niece Betty Kane, the Bat-Girl. Kathy and Betty were romantically interested in Batman and Robin, respectively. Robin seemed to return Bat-Girl's affection, while Batman remained aloof. In 1964 however, DC dropped Batwoman, as well as Bat-Girl, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite from the Batman titles, which were undergoing a revamp under editor Julius Schwartz that eliminated many of the sci-fi elements that were introduced in the 1950s. However, Batwoman continues to make appearances in stories published during the next few years in the Batman-Superman team-up book World's Finest. The character would later reappear in the late 1970s, made guest appearances in the Batman Family and Freedom Fighters comic book series, often fighting crime alongside Barbara Gordon, who had become the new Batgirl. In a story depicting Batwoman as a retired crimefighter, she becomes the owner of a circus, which she keeps until killed by the League of Assassins and the brainwashed Bronze Tiger.|$|E

5|$|Netflix {{required}} the production to shoot with 4K cameras {{to make the}} look of the show future-proof and John Toll who is credited as the main director of photography for overseeing the distinct look of the nine featured locations, made the decision to shoot by using mostly Sony's CineAlta PMW-F55 cameras, paired with Carl Zeiss Ultra Prime and Cooke Optics S4 lenses. During the first season, Toll, once again collaborating with the Wachowskis and Glass after Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending, personally handled the cinematography in San Francisco, Chicago, London, Iceland, and Seoul. Toll's approach to shooting was to use a lot of Steadicam and hand-held <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the necessity to follow the faster schedule of a television production compared to the feature films he was used to working on. Additional cinematographers worked {{with the rest of the}} directors in the remaining locations and they used a similar shooting style because they were facing the same scheduling challenges. McTeigue's cinematographer of choice for shooting in Mexico City and Mumbai was Danny Ruhlmann, who previously shot The Raven and Survivor for him. Tykwer worked with Frank Griebe and Christian Almesberger for the Berlin and Nairobi scenes respectively. Griebe had previously shot seven feature films of Tykwer's including Cloud Atlas and Almesberger was the cinematographer of two films Tykwer had produced in Nairobi: Soul Boy and Nairobi Half Life.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, The Nameless One meets seven {{characters}} who can join him on his quest: Morte, Annah-of-the-Shadows, Dak'kon, Ignus, Nordom, Fall-From-Grace, and Vhailor. These playable characters can also interact with the Nameless One to further the game's plot. Morte is a cynical floating skull originally from the Pillar of Skulls in Baator. He is introduced at the game's beginning in the mortuary. Morte loyally follows The Nameless One, <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> guilt for having caused the deaths of some of his previous incarnations. The Nameless One meets Annah-of-the-Shadows, a young and brash tiefling (a human with fiendish ancestry) rogue, outside the mortuary, but she does not join the group until a later point in the game. Dak'kon is a githzerai, who once made an oath to follow The Nameless One until the latter died, not knowing of The Nameless One's immortality; this bound him to The Nameless One for eternity. Ignus is a pyromaniacal mage who was the apprentice of one of The Nameless One's past selves. In the Rubikon Dungeon Construct, the Nameless One can find Nordom, a modron disconnected from its species' hive mind. Fall-From-Grace is a succubus who acts as proprietress of the Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts in Sigil; unlike other succubi, she is not interested in seducing mortals. Vhailor, found below the city of Curst on the plane of the Outlands, is essentially an animated suit of armor dedicated to serving merciless justice.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th century Adam Smith {{presented}} a philosophical foundation for explaining {{the relationship between}} law and economics. The discipline arose <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a critique of trade unions and U.S. antitrust law.

25|$|For a long time, Chongryon enjoyed {{unofficial}} {{immunity from}} searches and investigations, <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> respect for {{its role as}} North Korea's de facto embassy, and partly due to its power as a political pressure group. However, escalating tensions between Japan and North Korea {{over a number of}} issues, namely its nuclear weapons programme and its abduction of Japanese nationals has led to a resurgence of public animosity against Chongryon due to its active support of the Pyongyang regime. Acts which Chongryon officials are suspected of include illicit transfer of funds to North Korea, espionage, and smuggling of technology and missile parts.|$|E

25|$|Although its {{strongly}} conservative {{views on}} theology and ethics {{might seem to}} make the LCMS politically compatible with Protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the U.S., the LCMS largely eschews political activity, <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the Lutheran distinction between the Two Kingdoms (see above), which repudiates the primarily Calvinist presuppositions about the totalizing rule of God that informs much, if not most, of U.S. evangelical understanding of politics and Christianity. However, both LCMS and Evangelicals share the common belief that life begins and should be protected by law since conception.|$|E

25|$|Aged {{thermocouples}} {{are only}} partly modified, for example being unaffected in the parts outside the furnace. For this reason, aged thermocouples cannot {{be taken out}} of their installed location and recalibrated in a bath or test furnace to determine error. This also explains why error can sometimes be observed when an aged thermocouple is pulled <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a furnace—as the sensor is pulled back, aged sections may see exposure to increased temperature gradients from hot to cold as the aged section now passes through the cooler refractory area, contributing significant error to the measurement. Likewise, an aged thermocouple that is pushed deeper into the furnace might sometimes provide a more accurate reading if being pushed further into the furnace causes the temperature gradient to occur only in a fresh section.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, Coppola won {{the annual}} Samuel Goldwyn Award {{for the best}} {{screenplay}} (Pilma, Pilma) written by a UCLA student. This secured him {{a job as a}} scriptwriter with Seven Arts. In between, he co-wrote the scripts for This Property Is Condemned (1966) and Is Paris Burning? (1966). However, with fame still eluding him and <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> desperation, Coppola bought the rights to the David Benedictus novel You're a Big Boy Now and fused it with a story idea of his own, resulting in You're a Big Boy Now (1966). This was his UCLA thesis project that also received a theatrical release via Warner Bros. This movie brought him some critical acclaim and eventually his Master of Fine Arts Degree from UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television in 1967.|$|E
25|$|In 1379 Bishop Buckingham {{confirmed}} {{an important}} ordinance of Thomas Marshall, setting apart certain {{funds for the}} education of one of the canons at Oxford. The prior alludes to the poverty of his house, which was so great that {{were it not for the}} help of friends they would not be able to live decently and honestly, and religion would be diminished. Hitherto there had not been enough canons nor enough money to set apart one for special study; but the prior now wished to do so (<b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the profits of a chantry established by his own family), 'seeing the advantage of learning and the necessity of preaching, the priory being a populous place where a great number of people come together.' All this certainly points to a satisfactory state of the priory under Thomas Marshall, and accords well with what we know of his character from other sources.|$|E
25|$|Von Kluck sent von der Marwitz's II Cavalry Corps (3 cavalry divisions) {{around the}} British west flank {{to prevent a}} British retreat on the Channel ports. Sir John French sent a message (24 August), with an unmistakable tone of pique, to Lanrezac, which Spears insisted on writing down, warning that the BEF might have to retreat {{southwest}} towards Amiens on its lines of communication, although it is unclear that this would actually have been practicable if the Germans had actually been moving in force around the British left flank. However, Sir John agreed to Joffre's request that the BEF, now numbering 5 divisions {{as it had been}} joined by the 4th Infantry Division, would instead fall back on Cambrai if it had to, so that the BEF could still protect the French left flank. Joffre also sent a further two French reserve divisions to the British left flank, the beginning of the redeployment of French forces which would see Maunoury's Sixth Army form around Amiens and then fight near Paris. French considered, but rejected, the option of sheltering the BEF in the fortified town of Maubeuge, <b>partly</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> instinct that the Germans were hoping to tempt him into allowing himself to be besieged there and partly because he remembered that Edward Hamley had likened Bazaine allowing himself to be besieged in Metz in 1870 to a shipwrecked man taking hold of the anchor. French himself issued no direct written orders between 11.15pm on 21 August and 8.25pm on 24 August; Terraine argued that this, along with his absence during the battle of Mons (although on the German side von Kluck also played little direct role in the battle), marks the point when he and GHQ began to disengage from active command of the BEF, leaving Smith-Dorrien and Haig in effective control of their corps.|$|E
