50|$|The {{distinguishing}} factor {{between the}} process of non-human animal and human mummification is when the two types were mummified.

The earliest signs of non-human animal mummies are dated to the Badarian Predynastic Period (5500-4000BC) after the unification of upper and lower Egypt. It is likely that animal mummies did not exist earlier on because mummification was less accessible primarily due to cost.

Bituminous mixtures of different BRA binders and <b>petroleum</b> <b>bitumen</b> were prepared. Ordinary bitumen was added to the mixture of granular BRA to achieve the optimum bitumen content. It was found that BRA binders yield mixtures with better stifhess modulus, rate of permanent deformation, and creep stifhess compared to <b>petroleum</b> <b>bitumen</b> mixture.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{rheological}} properties of asphaltite-modified bituminous binders. The natural asphaltite, employed to modify a petroleum-derived-bitumen, is mined in Albania. At a first time, penetration,ring ball temperature and rheological properties of both asphaltite and pure <b>petroleum</b> <b>bitumen</b> are determined. Then, the <b>petroleum</b> <b>bitumen</b> is mixed with 5, 10 and 15 % of natural bitumen and the penetration and ring ball temperature of the blends are assessed. In addition to this, rheological tests are performed on the 10 % blend. The rheological experimental tests are carried out {{by means of a}} visco-analyzer METRAVIB under annular shearing and tension-compression loadings. Based on the experimental results and assuming that the material follows the time-temperature superposition principle (TTSP), master curves of complex modulus and of phase angle are constructed. The results show that the modified bitumens get stiffer and behave more elastically with the modification rate. This evolution is explained by the physicochemical composition of the asphaltite which presents high asphaltene agglomerates content. These improved characteristics are interesting for binders’ behavior at high temperature conditions in pavement applications. The experimental data are modeled by means of a simple blending law. In addition to this, some efforts are done to model the blend’s behavior by the Palierne’s model developed for emulsions of viscoelastic phases...|$|E

The pyrobitumen designation was, however, based uniquely on analytical criteria, namely insolubility (in CS 2), hardness, and fusibility. Many naturally-occurring types of bitumen which satisfy these criteria are thermally immature. This anomaly was rectified by Curiale (1986) who related solid insoluble bitumens according to their pre-oil (expulsion {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the source rock) or post-oil (derived from residues of formerly liquid petroleum) origins. Jacob (1989) also sought to define bitumens according to their origin and stage of thermal evolution, using reflectivity and elemental composition.

The accepted view is that animals were merely wrapped in coarse linen bandages and/or dipped in 'resin' before death 2, 3, 4. However, as with human mummification there was a range of qualities of treatments, and visual inspection of animal mummies suggests that the procedures used were often as complex as those used in humans (for example, evisceration and elaborate bandaging).

3000|$|Bitumen has {{a complex}} {{chemical}} structure and {{is composed of}} compounds found in crude oil. <b>Petroleum</b> <b>bitumen</b> comprises {{a large number of}} different colloidal and suspended hydrocarbons. Carbon and hydrogen are the two main elements of bitumen, and their percentage by weight is 70 – 87 and 10 – 15 %, respectively. In addition to carbon and hydrogen, other elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, halogens and metals such as nickel, iron, cobalt and vanadium are found in bitumen. Crude oil can be fractionated into asphaltene and Malten. Malten is a group of petroleum aromatic compounds into which polar aromatic (resin) and saturated (paraffin) compounds are classified. The physical and chemical properties of bitumen are the determining factors for its use, and are affected by {{the quantity and quality of}} its ingredients and the process of refining hydrocarbons. Additives used to change the characteristics of asphalt, especially for concrete pavement, have lead to improved technical specifications. The first examples of asphalt sulfur were created in America and Canada in the mid-seventies (Bissada 1985). Increasing the sulfur content improves the properties of bitumen, including enhanced permeability, reduced viscosity and improved adhesion of the bitumen for aggregation, and has been used to produce asphalt concrete with higher mechanical resistance (Kandhal 1982). The pavement performance of sulfur-extended asphalt in different parts of the world indicates consistency of performance in most regions, equal to or better than that of conventional asphalt (Filippis 1998). Economic factors, such as increased lifespan and durability compared to conventional asphalt promote the use of asphalt after sulfur has been added, and increases savings due to energy expenditure by reducing the temperature necessary for the production of the asphalt mix (Miller 1981) and to make it resistant to oil-based solvents.|$|E

The TLA blend containing 1 % rubber additive had a relatively higher G * (stiffness). Blends containing between 1 % and 4 % were less elastic (higher δ) than pure TLA whereas the blend containing 5 % was more elastic (lower δ). The dependency of the parent asphalt composition on the rheological properties of modified asphalt blends was evident. In the case of TPB, the incremental addition of the tyre rubber resulted in an increase in the values of G * and a general decrease in δ as the concentration of rubber was increased. Maximum values of G * and minimum values of δ were observed for both TLA and TPB blends when the particle size of the rubber was in the range> 355 µm to 500 µm.

Two bitumen fractionation method, Rostler and Corbett methods were used to extract each chemical fraction of bitumen. A number of experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of each chemical fraction on bitumen rheology such as the effect of asphaltenes, polar aromatics, naphthene aromatics, nitrogen bases, first acidaffins, second acidaffins and paraffins on elastic modulus (G’), viscous modulus (G”) or fatigue factor (G*sin[δ]), and rutting fator (G*/sin[δ]). Two bitumen from different sources, namely Petronas <b>petroleum</b> <b>bitumen</b> and Buton rock asphalt (BRA) bitumen, were used. New chemicalrheological models were formulated to estimate the bitumen rheology in corporating parameters which are G’, G” or (G*sin[δ]), and (G*/sin[δ]) based on the chemical properties. Furthermore, new chemical durability indices that may indicate the ageing rate of bitumen during short-term and long-term ageing were also formulated. Based on statistical analyses, the models and the indices, which were developed by using chemical properties according to Rostler method were found to be invalid because the real and the predicted rheology were significantly different.

Using a 25 ml Hastalloy vessel, the source rocks were pyrolysed at low (180 and 245 bar) and high (500, 700 and 900 bar) water pressure hydrous conditions at 350 °C and 380 °C for between 6 and 24 h. For the Kimmeridge Clay (KCF) at 350 °C, Rock Eval HI of the pyrolysed rock residues were 30 – 44 mg/g higher between 6 h and 12 h at 900 bar than at 180 bar. Also at 350 °C for 24 h the gas, expelled oil, and vitrinite reflectance (VR) were all reduced by 46 %, 61 %, and 0. 25 % Ro respectively at 900 bar compared with 180 bar. At 380 °C the retardation effect {{of pressure on the}} KCF was less significant for gas generation. However, oil yield and VR were reduced by 47 % and 0. 3 % Ro respectively, and Rock Eval HI was also higher by 28 mg/g at 900 bar compared with 245 bar at 12 h. The huge decrease in gas and oil yields and the VR observed with an increase in water pressure at 350 °C for 24 h and 380 °C for 12 h (maximum oil generation) were also observed for all other times and temperatures investigated for the KCF and the Monterey shale. This shows that high water pressure significantly retards petroleum generation and source rock maturation. The retardation of oil generation and expulsion resulted in significant amounts of bitumen and oil being retained in the rocks pyrolysed at high pressures, suggesting that pressure is a possible mechanism for retaining <b>petroleum</b> (<b>bitumen</b> and oil) in source rocks. This retention of petroleum within the rock provides a mechanism for oil-prone source rocks to become potential shale gas reservoirs. The implications from this study are that in geological basins, pressure, temperature and time will all exert significant control on the extent of petroleum generation and source rock maturation for Type II source rocks, and that the petroleum retained in the rocks at high pressures may explain in part why oil-prone source rocks contain the most prolific shale gas resources...|$|E
40|$|From the Indus Valley to Mesopotamia, California and {{northern}} Canada, natural seeps of degraded <b>petroleum</b> or <b>bitumen</b> have intrigued humans {{for thousands of}} years. At some unknown time a value-adding technological breakthrough took place along the Athabasca River in northern Alberta when an aboriginal discovered that if bitumen oozing from the oil sands on the river bank was mixed with the tar or pitch from spruce trees, it made a far superior caulking material for canoes than pitch alone. As sources of lighter grades of crude oil become depleted and what remains increasingly inaccessible for the international oil industry, its attention has turned to unconventional oil and gas. A decade ago few knew or cared about this sub-sector of the petroleum business. By 2010 according to IHS Herold, unconventional resources accounted for 25 percent of global oil and gas M&A value; US and Canadian unconventional oil and gas deals amounted to $ 100 billion {{over the past five}} years. In 2009 and 2010, 30 to 40 percent of all acquisitions were by Asian NOCs. They seek a position in these vast resources and the technical expertise of the local companies, who have been testing technologies to develop them, but lack sufficient capital to launch major projects. Paradoxically, while unconventional oil and gas have attracted a large share of M&A capital, their contribution to world oil supply is unlikely to exceed 10 percent by 2030. Technological breakthroughs could change this, but it is argued here, this is unlikely. <p...|$|R
40|$|Naphthenic acids (NAs) are an {{important}} group of trace organic pollutants predominantly comprising saturated aliphatic and alicyclic carboxylic acids. NAs are ubiquitous; occurring naturally in hydrocarbon deposits (<b>petroleum,</b> oil sands, <b>bitumen,</b> and crude oils) and also have widespread industrial uses. Consequently, NAs can enter the environment from both natural and anthropogenic processes. NAs are highly toxic, recalcitrant compounds that persist in the environment for many years, {{and it is important}} to develop efficient bioremediation strategies to decrease both their abundance and toxicity in the environment. However, the diversity of microbial communities involved in NA-degradation, and the mechanisms by which NAs are biodegraded, are poorly understood. This lack of knowledge is mainly due to the difficulties in identifying and purifying individual carboxylic acid compounds from complex NA mixtures found in the environment, for microbial biodegradation studies. This paper will present an overview of NAs, their origin and fate in the environment, and their toxicity to the biota. The review describes the microbial degradation of both naturally occurring and chemically synthesized NAs. Proposed pathways for aerobic NA biodegradation, factors affecting NA biodegradation rates, and possible bioremediation strategies are also discussed. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

30|$|Since {{the early}} periods {{of oil and}} gas {{exploration}} activities, hydrocarbon seeps (solid or liquid) have been considered as an important clue. Although it does not always show an oil accumulation of economic value, it has been considered as a sign that requires assessment for new exploration areas (Clarke and Cleverly 1991). Hydrocarbon seep is important in following the movement of oil that is generated by the source rocks or from underground reservoir towards surface, and therefore, for the estimation of the migration route and accumulation areas. The seeps of the hydrocarbon accumulations in bigger and continuous amounts on the sedimentations that are on the surface is defined as “Active Seep-macro seeps”; and the residues that are not observable as continuous flow on the surface are defined as “Passive Seeps-micro seeps” (Abrams 1996). Macro seeps may be monitored with <b>petroleum,</b> gas, <b>bitumen</b> traces, and asphalt; and micro seeps (such as La Brea tar pits, Los Angeles; Baku, Azerbaijan and Bermudez (Guannoco) Lake in Venezuela) may be monitored with various organic geochemical analyses and with the volatile or semi-volatile hydrocarbons or with hydrocarbon changes in the soil and sediments (Abrams 1996, 2005; van der Meer et al. 2002). For example, the Mescid-i Suleyman oil field and Gipssland Basin were discovered by making use of petroleum and gas seeps (Hunt 1996). As in this study, leaking oil can be observed in rock cracks or void fill and such residues are defined as solid bitumen (Jacob 1989). Solid bitumen (“migrabitumen”) are secondary organic matter products that are filling voids and fractures in the rocks, and can occur within the source rocks and reservoir rocks in various basins around the world. The main reasons for their occurrence are the advanced thermal maturity and migration mechanism, mainly degradation (Curiale 1986). Many studies make it possible to better understanding to the solid bituminous origin and the thermal maturity of the sequences (Curiale 1986; Landis and Castaño 1995; George et al. 2007; Huc et al. 2000; Hwang et al. 1998; Kelemen et al. 2008, 2010; Petersen et al. 2013).|$|R
