5|$|In general however, downstep is more {{widespread}} than in Supyire; a similar <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> found in Palaka, Tagwana, and Djimini.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Greeks {{noticed that}} amber {{attracted}} small objects when rubbed with fur. Along with lightning, this <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> one of humanity's earliest recorded experiences with electricity.|$|E
50|$|Electrical <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> commonplace {{and unusual}} events {{that can be}} {{observed}} and that illuminate {{the principles of the}} physics of electricity and are explained by them.Electrical <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> a somewhat arbitrary division ofelectromagnetic phenomena.|$|R
50|$|In many {{scientific}} and engineering fields, computer simulations of real <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> commonly used. When the real <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> affected by unpredictable processes, such as radio noise or day-to-day weather, these processes can be simulated using random or pseudo-random numbers.|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{for some}} {{connection}} between weather and solar related <b>phenomena</b> <b>is</b> presented. Historical data of world wide temperature variations with relationship {{to change in}} solar luminosity are examined. Several test methods for estimating the statistical significance of such <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> discussed in detail...|$|R
5|$|Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder {{mentioned}} that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow and many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen {{was involved in}} the process, both in wood and in glow-worms. It was not until the late nineteenth century that bioluminescence was properly investigated. The <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments where dinoflagellates cause phosphorescence in the surface layers of water. On land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.|$|E

5|$|Hadley has {{conducted}} research on animal rights extremism, {{concluding that the}} <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> a complex one, and that {{a full understanding of}} individual extremists' intentions and targets are necessary to understand the ethical acceptability of extremist acts and whether such acts are appropriately classified as terrorism. He holds that while direct action should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.|$|E
5000|$|Sensory <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> general feelings, urges or bodily sensations that precede or {{accompany}} repetitive behaviors {{associated with}} Tourette syndrome and tic disorders. These <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> also defined as [...] "generalized or focal uncomfortable feelings or sensations preceding tics that usually are relieved by the movement".|$|R
40|$|Various {{geophysical}} <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> {{produced by}} both wave and particle emission from solar flares. In understanding these <b>phenomena,</b> it <b>is</b> necessary {{to investigate the}} nature of these emissions and solar flare phenomena. Using the observed data for these emissions, a review is given on the nature of solar flares and their development. Geophysical <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> discussed by referring to the results for solar flare phenomena...|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} and comparison of various EXAFS-like <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> presented based on {{theoretical and practical}} considerations. Most of the <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> similar but {{not exactly the same}} as EXAFS. This does not limit their usefulness for structure determination but requires separate experimental calibration and theoretical calculations...|$|R
5|$|The cloudy {{outer edge}} of the eye is called the “eyewall”. The eyewall {{typically}} expands outward with height, resembling an arena football stadium; this <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> sometimes referred to as the stadium effect. The eyewall is where the greatest wind speeds are found, air rises most rapidly, clouds reach to their highest altitude, and precipitation is the heaviest. The heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.|$|E
5|$|The oxides and {{hydroxides}} of neptunium {{are closely}} related to its ions. In general, Np hydroxides at various oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before it on the periodic table such as thorium and uranium and more stable than those after it such as plutonium and americium. This <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus actinides higher on the periodic table will more readily undergo hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} {{gyroscopic}} effect in most bike designs is to help steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean. This <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> called precession and the rate at which an object precesses is inversely proportional to its rate of spin. The slower a front wheel spins, the faster it will precess when the bike leans, and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of metal cutting processes is particularly complex {{due to the}} diversity of the physical <b>phenomena</b> involved. It <b>is</b> difficult to reproduce all the phenomenon in a single simulation, thus a multi-scale approach is necessary. The presentation focuses on 2 scales : i) the macroscopic scale where dynamic <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> handle, ii) the mesoscopic scale where thermomechanical <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> handle...|$|R

5|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{observations}} of gravity-related phenomena during solar eclipses, especially during the period of totality. In 1954, and again in 1959, Maurice Allais reported observations of strange and unexplained movement during solar eclipses. The reality of this phenomenon, named the Allais effect, has remained controversial. Similarly, in 1970, Saxl and Allen observed the sudden change in motion of a torsion pendulum; this <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> called the Saxl effect.|$|E
5|$|Tunneling {{diffusion}} is {{a physical}} manifestation of the quantum tunneling effect involving particles tunneling across diffusion barriers. It can occur {{in the case of}} low diffusing particle mass and low Ediff, and has been observed in the case of hydrogen diffusion on tungsten and copper surfaces. The <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> unique in that in the regime where the tunneling mechanism dominates, the diffusion rate is nearly temperature-independent.|$|E
5|$|Water {{can also}} be sucked away from shore prior to a storm surge. This was the case on the western Florida coast in 2017, just before Hurricane Irma made landfall, {{uncovering}} land usually underwater. This <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> known as a reverse storm surge, or a negative storm surge.|$|E
5000|$|Pop {{cultural}} <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> frequently cited. Among these are: ...|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} and most interesting features of this Mirusha natural <b>phenomenon,</b> <b>are</b> lakes and waterfalls. These natural <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> created {{in the middle and}} end course of Mirusha river with a length of 650 m. In this area are situated 16 lakes and 12 waterfalls of different forms and sizes.|$|R

5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E
5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{mutations}} {{that change}} protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have benefits. These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation {{will tend to}} become more common in a population through natural selection. Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive responses. In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, E. coli, multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. This <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> called clonal interference and causes competition among the mutations.|$|E

5000|$|Three <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> {{associated}} {{with a lack of}} integrated design: ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{phenomenon}} (Greek:φαινόμενον, phainómenon, {{from the}} verb phainein, to show, shine, appear, to be manifest or manifest itself, plural <b>phenomena)</b> <b>is</b> any thing which manifests itself. <b>Phenomena</b> <b>are</b> often, but not always, understood as [...] "things that appear" [...] or [...] "experiences" [...] for a sentient being, or in principle may be so.|$|R
5|$|Another {{complication}} is {{release in}} multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable {{example of this}} <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films. Social and economic factors such as population change {{and the growth of}} international markets also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.|$|E
5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{is not a}} human invention, and may be {{observed}} in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure. This <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Scientific Advisory Board Secretariat has {{suggested}} that this project not be declassified {{for a variety of}} reasons, chief among which is that no scientific explanation for any of the fireballs and other <b>phenomena</b> <b>was</b> revealed by the report and that some reputable scientists still believe that the observed <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> man-made." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{depopulation}} of cockroaches may be exaggerated, or this <b>phenomenon</b> may <b>be</b> temporary or cyclic. A {{number of}} {{explanations of the}} <b>phenomenon</b> <b>are</b> discussed in the media, of varying degree of credibility.|$|R
5000|$|Similar <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> {{described}} in Japanese folklore, including Hitodama (literally [...] "Human Soul" [...] as {{a ball of}} energy), Hi no Tama (Ball of Flame), Aburagae, Koemonbi, Ushionibi, etc. All these <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> described as balls of flame or light, at times associated with graveyards, but occurring across Japan as a whole {{in a wide variety}} of situations and locations. Kitsune, mythical yokai demons, are also associated with will 'o the wisp, with the marriage of two kitsune producing kitsune-bi (狐火), literally meaning 'fox-fire'. These <b>phenomena</b> <b>are</b> {{described in}} Shigeru Mizuki's 1985 book Graphic World of Japanese Phantoms (妖怪伝 in Japanese).|$|R
