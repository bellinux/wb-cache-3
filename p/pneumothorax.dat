5|$|A primary <b>pneumothorax</b> is {{one that}} occurs without an {{apparent}} cause {{and in the absence}} of significant lung disease, while a secondary <b>pneumothorax</b> occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking increases the risk as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A <b>pneumothorax</b> can also be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including a blast injury), or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in which case it is called a traumatic <b>pneumothorax.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{multiple}} definitions exist, {{a tension}} <b>pneumothorax</b> {{is generally considered}} to be present when a <b>pneumothorax</b> (primary spontaneous, secondary spontaneous, or traumatic) leads to significant impairment of respiration and/or blood circulation. Tension <b>pneumothorax</b> tends to occur in clinical situations such as ventilation, resuscitation, trauma, or in patients with lung disease.|$|E
5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} used {{first-line}} when <b>pneumothorax</b> occurs {{in people with}} AIDS, usually due to underlying pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), as this condition is associated with prolonged air leakage. Bilateral <b>pneumothorax</b> (<b>pneumothorax</b> on both sides) is relatively common in people with pneumocystis pneumonia, and surgery is often required.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pneumothorax</b> was {{described}} in 1803 by Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, a student of René Laennec, who provided an extensive description of the clinical picture in 1819. While Itard and Laennec recognized that some cases were not due to tuberculosis (then the most common cause), the concept of spontaneous <b>pneumothorax</b> {{in the absence of}} tuberculosis (primary <b>pneumothorax)</b> was reintroduced by the Danish physician Hans Kjærgaard in 1932. In 1941, the surgeons Tyson and Crandall introduced pleural abrasion for the treatment of <b>pneumothorax.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of <b>pneumothorax</b> can be vague and inconclusive, especially {{in those with}} a small PSP; confirmation with medical imaging is usually required. In contrast, tension <b>pneumothorax</b> is a medical emergency and may be treated before imaging – especially if there is severe hypoxia, very low blood pressure, or an impaired level of consciousness. In tension <b>pneumothorax,</b> X-rays are sometimes required if there is doubt about the anatomical location of the <b>pneumothorax.</b>|$|E
5|$|A further use of CT {{is in the}} {{identification}} of underlying lung lesions. In presumed primary <b>pneumothorax,</b> it may help to identify blebs or cystic lesions (in anticipation of treatment, see below), and in secondary <b>pneumothorax</b> it can help to identify most of the causes listed above.|$|E
5|$|A {{preventative}} procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of <b>pneumothorax,</b> with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of <b>pneumothorax</b> require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation {{of the risk of}} recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second <b>pneumothorax.</b> Surgery may need to be considered if someone has experienced <b>pneumothorax</b> on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Medical procedures, {{such as the}} {{insertion}} of a central venous catheter {{into one of the}} chest veins or the taking of biopsy samples from lung tissue, may lead to <b>pneumothorax.</b> The administration of positive pressure ventilation, either mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation, can result in barotrauma (pressure-related injury) leading to a <b>pneumothorax.</b>|$|E
5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic <b>pneumothorax.</b> Spontaneous <b>pneumothorax</b> is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic <b>pneumothorax</b> {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic <b>pneumothorax</b> may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension <b>pneumothorax</b> – the presence of which may be suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E
5|$|A <b>pneumothorax</b> (collapsed lung) is an {{abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic <b>pneumothorax,</b> where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E
5|$|A <b>pneumothorax</b> is an {{abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension <b>pneumothorax.</b> This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a <b>pneumothorax.</b> It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{spontaneous}} <b>pneumothorax</b> (PSP) {{tends to}} occur in a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features. People who are affected by PSPs are often unaware of potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention. PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure, explaining to some extent why episodes of <b>pneumothorax</b> may happen in clusters. It is rare for PSPs to cause tension pneumothoraces.|$|E
5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} <b>pneumothorax</b> will typically resolve without {{treatment and}} requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} appropriate in {{people who have no}} underlying lung disease. In a larger <b>pneumothorax,</b> or if there is shortness of breath, the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of <b>pneumothorax</b> occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E
5|$|Air {{travel is}} {{discouraged}} {{for up to}} seven days after complete resolution of a <b>pneumothorax</b> if recurrence does not occur. Underwater diving is considered unsafe after an episode of <b>pneumothorax</b> unless a preventative procedure has been performed. Professional guidelines suggest that pleurectomy be performed on both lungs and that lung function tests and CT scan normalize before diving is resumed. Aircraft pilots may also require assessment for surgery.|$|E
5|$|An early {{description}} of traumatic <b>pneumothorax</b> secondary to rib fractures appears in Imperial Surgery by Turkish surgeon Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu (1385–1468), which also recommends {{a method of}} simple aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by a disruption of the pleura {{and those that are}} not; in the former, air can leak from the hole in the airway and a <b>pneumothorax</b> can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; <b>pneumothorax</b> is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{recurrent}} <b>pneumothorax</b> or pulmonary cysts {{are associated}} with Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, and cystic fibrosis. Non-hereditary recurrent <b>pneumothorax</b> and/or pulmonary cysts can occur with Langerhans cell histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. These conditions are differentiated from Birt–Hogg–Dubé through examining the patient history and performing a physical examination. In women suspected to have the disease, ruling out pulmonary or thoracic endometriosis may be necessary.|$|E
5|$|If <b>pneumothorax</b> {{occurs in}} a smoker, this is {{considered}} an opportunity to emphasize the markedly increased risk of recurrence in those who continue to smoke, and the many benefits of smoking cessation. It may be advisable for someone to remain off work {{for up to a}} week after a spontaneous <b>pneumothorax.</b> If the person normally performs heavy manual labor, several weeks may be required. Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous pneumothoraces {{are divided}} into two types: primary, which occurs {{in the absence of}} known lung disease, and secondary, which occurs in someone with {{underlying}} lung disease. The cause of primary spontaneous <b>pneumothorax</b> is unknown, but established risk factors include male sex, smoking, and a family history of <b>pneumothorax.</b> Smoking either cannabis or tobacco increases the risk. The various suspected underlying mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Tension <b>pneumothorax</b> {{is usually}} treated with urgent needle decompression. This may be {{required}} before transport to the hospital, and can be performed by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional. The needle or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted. If tension <b>pneumothorax</b> leads to cardiac arrest, needle decompression is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore cardiac output.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of <b>pneumothorax</b> {{depends on a}} number of factors, and may vary from discharge with early follow-up to immediate needle decompression or insertion of a chest tube. Treatment is determined by the severity of symptoms and indicators of acute illness, the presence of underlying lung disease, the estimated size of the <b>pneumothorax</b> on X-ray, and – in some instances – on the personal preference of the person involved.|$|E
5|$|Ultrasound is {{commonly}} used {{in the evaluation of}} people who have sustained physical trauma, for example with the FAST protocol. Ultrasound may be more sensitive than chest X-rays in the identification of <b>pneumothorax</b> after blunt trauma to the chest. Ultrasound may also provide a rapid diagnosis in other emergency situations, and allow the quantification {{of the size of the}} <b>pneumothorax.</b> Several particular features on ultrasonography of the chest can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Death from <b>pneumothorax</b> is very {{uncommon}} (except {{in tension}} pneumothoraces). British statistics show an annual mortality rate of 1.26 and 0.62 deaths per million person-years {{in men and}} women, respectively. A significantly increased risk of death is seen in older victims and in those with secondary pneumothoraces.|$|E
5|$|Small {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces do {{not always}} require treatment, as {{they are unlikely to}} proceed to respiratory failure or tension <b>pneumothorax,</b> and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the <b>pneumothorax</b> is small (defined as <50% of the volume of the hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease. It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited. Admission to hospital is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient, at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below). Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete <b>pneumothorax</b> would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks. There; however, is no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management.|$|E
5|$|Traumatic <b>pneumothorax</b> most {{commonly}} {{occurs when the}} chest wall is pierced, such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises {{the integrity of the}} involved structures. Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only rib fractures being more common in this group. The <b>pneumothorax</b> can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge - particularly if mechanical ventilation is required. They are also encountered in patients already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{physical}} examination, {{breath sounds}} (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because {{air in the}} pleural space dampens the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations {{to the surface of}} the chest may be altered. Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the <b>pneumothorax</b> can show limited correlation with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the <b>pneumothorax</b> is relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Aspiration {{may also}} be {{considered}} in secondary <b>pneumothorax</b> of moderate size (air rim 1–2cm) without breathlessness, with the difference that ongoing observation in hospital is required even after a successful procedure. American professional guidelines state that all large pneumothoraces – even those due to PSP – should be treated with a chest tube. Moderately sized iatrogenic traumatic pneumothoraces (due to medical procedures) may initially be treated with aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé can be {{difficult}} to diagnose from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, <b>pneumothorax,</b> and cutaneous tumors occur with other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors similar to those seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), hereditary papillary renal cancer (papillary renal cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology.|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} can manifest {{similarly to}} other diseases, {{which must be}} ruled out when making a diagnosis. These include tuberous sclerosis, which causes skin lesions similar to fibrofolliculomas, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease, which causes hereditary kidney cancers. Once diagnosed, people with BHD are treated preventatively, with monitoring of kidneys and lungs using medical imaging. Fibrofolliculomas can be removed surgically and <b>pneumothorax</b> and kidney cancer are treated according to the normal standard of care.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (<b>pneumothorax)</b> in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a <b>pneumothorax</b> to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a <b>pneumothorax</b> by {{physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|In {{secondary}} spontaneous <b>pneumothorax,</b> {{the estimated}} annual AAIR is 6.3 and 2.0 cases per 100,000 person-years {{for males and}} females, respectively, with the risk of recurrence depending on the presence and severity of any underlying lung disease. Once a second episode has occurred, {{there is a high}} likelihood of subsequent further episodes. The incidence in children has not been well studied, but is estimated to be between 5 and 10 cases per 100,000 person-years.|$|E
5|$|Tension <b>pneumothorax</b> {{occurs when}} the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space {{functions}} as a one-way valve, allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and respiratory arrest eventually follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the lungs can also be affected by compression from fluid in the pleural cavity pleural effusion, or other substances such as air (<b>pneumothorax),</b> blood (hemothorax), or rarer causes. These may be investigated using a chest X-ray or CT scan, and may require the insertion of a surgical drain until the underlying cause is identified and treated.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} TBI who die do so {{within minutes of}} the injury, due to {{complications}} such as <b>pneumothorax</b> and insufficient airway and to other injuries that occurred at the same time. Most late deaths that occur in TBI are attributed to sepsis or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). If the condition is not recognized and treated early, serious complications {{are more likely to}} occur; for example, pneumonia and bronchiectasis may occur as late complications. Years can pass before the condition is recognized. Some TBI are so small {{that they do not have}} significant clinical manifestations; they may never be noticed or diagnosed and may heal without intervention.|$|E
5|$|Tension <b>pneumothorax</b> {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} {{receiving}} mechanical ventilation, in which case {{it may be difficult}} to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent studies have shown that the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E
