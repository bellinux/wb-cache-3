50|$|The {{possibility}} of a device that produces frequency that causes vibration of the eyeballs — and therefore distortion of vision — was apparently confirmed {{by the work of}} engineer Vic Tandy while attempting to demystify a “haunting” in his laboratory in Coventry. This “spook” was characterised by a feeling of unease and vague glimpses of a grey apparition.

40|$|Why does a {{suspended}} fan not cool down {{the temperature of}} classroom during the summer season? Why do people sitting under the suspended fan {{for a long time}} still feel hot?

50|$|Due to delays {{with the}} Cruiser Mark VII Cavalier {{and the need}} for cruiser tanks, the Crusader was up-gunned with the 6-pounder, the first British tank to mount this gun.

The turret also received an <b>extractor</b> <b>fan</b> to clear fumes from the firing of the gun. The larger gun restricted turret space, so the crew was reduced to three, with the commander also acting as gun loader—the loader was already the wireless operator. The auxiliary turret space was given over to ammunition stowage.|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for controlling sugar cane loss during harvesting. In a mechanical harvester, unwanted leaf material {{is separated from}} sugarbearing cane in an air-stream, and waste material is thrown back onto the field. Up to {{ten percent of the}} cane harvested is also lost, and this can represent up to fifty million dollars per year. The primary <b>extractor</b> <b>fan</b> of a harvester generates the air-stream, and is the principal cleaning system during the harvesting process. The effectiveness of the fan varies with speed, and a compromise must be achieved between retaining trash and losing cane. An accurate and reliable measure of cane loss can be obtained by detecting the impacts of harvested cane on the blades of the fan. Field trials of this detection process have been successfully conducted on a cane harvester in Bundaberg...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{on the growing}} and harvesting of willow trees aimed at short rotation forestry was conducted in northern Japan. Willows were harvested using a sugarcane harvester from southern Japan during its agricultural off-season. The growing experiment showed the high potential of willow plantations to produce woody biomass of more than 10 dry-t/ha/y. The harvesting experiment showed that space for turning around, one line in one row as a planting method, a growing cycle of three years, and an <b>extractor</b> <b>fan</b> in the harvester are necessary for mechanical harvesting. Mechanical harvesting was considered to have little influence on willow regeneration provided that the machine cut reasonably well-grown trees. The system performance of harvesting and collecting willow billets in a hypothetical model field was calculated as 22. 4 m^ 3 /h, suggesting the feasibility of supplying low-cost wood chips...|$|R

40|$|Power {{extraction}} using a dielectric-loaded (DL) waveguide {{is a way}} {{to generate}} high-power radio frequency (RF) waves for future particle accelerators, especially for two-beam-acceleration. In a two-beam-acceleration scheme, a low-energy, high-current particle beam is passed through a deceleration section of waveguide (decelerator), where the power from the beam is partially transferred to trailing electromagnetic waves (wakefields); then with a properly designed RF output coupler, the power generated in the decelerator is extracted to an output waveguide, where finally the power can be transmitted and used to accelerate another usually high-energy low-current beam. The decelerator, together with the RF output coupler, is called a <b>power</b> <b>extractor.</b> At Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA), we designed a 7. 8 GHz <b>power</b> <b>extractor</b> with a circular DL waveguide and tested it with single electron bunches and bunch trains. The output RF frequency (7. 8 GHz) is the sixth harmonic of the operational frequency (1. 3 GHz) of the electron gun and the linac at AWA. In single bunch excitation, a 1. 7 ns RF pulse with 30 MW of power was generated by a single 66 nC electron bunch passing through the decelerator. In subsequent experiments, by employing different splitting-recombining optics for the photoinjector laser, electron bunch trains were generated and thus longer RF pulses could be successfully generated and extracted. In 16 -bunch experiments, 10 ns and 22 ns RF pulses have been generated and extracted; and in 4 -bunch experiments, the maximum power generated was 44 MW with 40 MW extracted. A 26 GHz DL <b>power</b> <b>extractor</b> has also been designed to test this technique in the millimeter-wave range. A power level of 148 MW is expected to be generated by a bunch train with a bunch spacing of 769 ps and bunch charges of 20 nC each. The arrangement for the experiment is illustrated in a diagram. Higher-order-mode (HOM) power extraction has also been explored in a dual-frequency design. By using a bunch train with a bunch spacing of 769 ps and bunch charges of 50 nC each, 90. 4 MW and 8. 68 MW of extracted power levels are expected to be reached at 20. 8 GHz and 35. 1 GHz, respectively. In order to improve efficiency in HOM power extraction, a novel technique has been proposed to suppress unintended modes...|$|R
