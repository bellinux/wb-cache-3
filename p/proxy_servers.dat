25|$|Using a {{transparent}} proxy has the unintended side effect, quite independent of IWF filtering, of appearing to websites connected to as originating from the proxy IP {{instead of the}} user's real IP. Some sites detect the user's IP and adjust their behaviour accordingly. For example, if trying to download files from a file distribution website which restricts free-of-charge usage by enforcing a delay of typically 30 minutes between downloads, any attempt to download is interpreted as originating from the ISP's proxy rather than the user. The consequence is that if any user of that ISP has downloaded any file from the site in the last half-hour (which is very likely for a large ISP), the download is not allowed. This is an unintended consequence of ISP's use of <b>proxy</b> <b>servers,</b> not IWF filtering. File sharing sites distribute files of all types; for example Linux distribution files, which are very large. The use of <b>proxy</b> <b>servers</b> is also reported to have caused the problem with editing Wikipedia (but not the blocking of the actual offending web page) reported above.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} to HTTP proxies {{is to use}} {{one of a number of}} add-ons and plug-ins for browsers, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs, which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. For example. the , enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like hdl:4263537/4000 or doi:10.1000/1 directly in the Firefox browser, using the native Handle System protocol. This plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle <b>proxy</b> <b>servers</b> with native resolution. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, mail reader, or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.|$|E

While state media showed only pro-Gaddafi protests, pictures and video from mobile phones that made their way from Libya onto Facebook pages told a different story. When Facebook and Twitter were blocked inside the country, users managed to circumvent restrictions by using satellite connections, <b>proxy</b> <b>servers,</b> and other means. Various other anti-government citizens compiled the amateur videos, pictures, and other sources of media onto websites to continue the protest. Early in the revolt some activists crossed into Egypt to post online videos and photos taken with mobile phones or tweeted news about events in the country. The hacker group Anonymous provided Libyans with tools to get round the censorship and some of its members reportedly managed to set up parallel networks. The group also helped people to pass on photos and videos.|$|E

500|$|The blacklisting of Virgin Killer {{also caused}} other {{inadvertent}} issues for Wikipedia {{users in the}} United Kingdom. Usually most Internet users have a unique IP address visible to websites. However, {{as a result of}} ISPs using the IWF blacklist implemented through Cleanfeed technology, traffic to Wikipedia via those affected ISPs was then routed through a small number of <b>proxy</b> <b>servers.</b> This caused problems for users of the site. Since Wikipedia allows users to anonymously edit its encyclopaedia articles, these individuals are identified only through their IP addresses, which are used to selectively block users who vandalise the site or otherwise break its rules. The proxy filtering makes it impossible to uniquely distinguish users, and to prevent vandalism Wikipedia [...] "instituted a blanket ban on anonymous edits from the six ISPs, which account for 95% of British residential internet users". This had the immediate effect of requiring nearly all registered users in the UK to request the lifting of [...] on their accounts before they could edit again, and the de facto permanent effect of barring any contribution from people without , who contribute merely under an IP address and not a user name.|$|E
