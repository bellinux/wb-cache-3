That is, each information bit is modulated by a sequence of much faster chips. Therefore, the chip rate is much higher than the information signal bit rate.|$|E
5000|$|With CDMA, {{multiple}} CDMA handsets share {{a specific}} radio channel. The signals {{are separated by}} using a <b>pseudonoise</b> code (PN code) specific to each phone. As the user moves from one cell to another, the handset sets up radio links with multiple cell sites (or sectors of the same site) simultaneously. This is known as [...] "soft handoff" [...] because, unlike with traditional cellular technology, {{there is no one}} defined point where the phone switches to the new cell.|$|E
50|$|Like MC-CDMA, CI-OFDM spreads each {{data symbol}} in the {{frequency}} domain. That is, each data symbol is carried over multiple OFDM subcarriers. But unlike MC-CDMA, which uses binary-phase Hadamard codes (code values of 0 or 180 degrees) or binary <b>pseudonoise,</b> CI codes are complex-valued orthogonal codes. In the simplest case, CI code values are coefficients of a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. Each row or column of the DFT matrix provides an orthogonal CI spreading code which spreads a data symbol. Spreading is achieved by multiplying a vector of data symbols by the DFT matrix to produce a vector of coded data symbols, then each coded data symbol is mapped to an OFDM subcarrier via an input bin of an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). A block of contiguous subcarriers may be selected, or to achieve better frequency diversity, non-contiguous subcarriers distributed over a wide frequency band can be used. A guard interval, such as a cyclic prefix (CP), {{is added to the}} baseband CI-OFDM signal before the signal is processed by a radio front-end to convert it to an RF signal, which is then transmitted by an antenna.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} secure {{techniques}} of audio watermarking is spread spectrum audio watermarking (SSW). In SSW, a narrow-band signal is transmitted over a much larger bandwidth such that the signal energy presented in any signal frequency is undetectable. Thus the watermark is spread over many frequency bands so that the energy in one band is undetectable. An interesting feature of this watermarking technique is that destroying it requires noise of high amplitude {{to be added to}} all frequency bands. SSW is a robust watermarking technique because, to eliminate it, the attack must affect all possible frequency bands with modifications of considerable strength. This creates visible defects in the data.Spreading spectrum is done by a <b>pseudonoise</b> (PN) sequence. In conventional SSW approaches, the receiver must know the PN sequence used at the transmitter as well as the location of the watermark in the watermarked signal for detecting hidden information. This is a high security feature, since any unauthorized user who does not have access to this information cannot detect any hidden information. Detection of the PN sequence is the key factor for detection of hidden information from SSW.Although PN sequence detection is possible by using heuristic approaches such as evolutionary algorithms, the high computational cost of this task can make it impractical. Much of the computational complexity involved in the use of evolutionary algorithms as an optimization tool is due to the fitness function evaluation that may either be very difficult to define or be computationally very expensive.|$|E

40|$|Even {{assuming}} perfect attitude {{sensors and}} gyros, sensor measurements on a vibrating spacecraft have apparent errors. These apparent sensor errors, {{referred to as}} <b>pseudonoise,</b> arise because gyro and sensor measurements are performed at discrete times. This paper explains the concept of <b>pseudonoise,</b> quantifies its behavior, and discusses the effect of vibrations that are nearly commensurate with measurement periods. Although <b>pseudonoise</b> does not usually affect attitude determination it does affect sensor performance evaluation. Attitude rates are usually computed from differences between pairs of accumulated angle measurements at different times and are considered constant in the periods between measurements. Propagation using these rates does not reproduce exact instantaneous spacecraft attitudes except at the gyro measurement times. Exact sensor measurements will therefore be inconsistent with estimates based on the propagated attitude. This inconsistency produces <b>pseudonoise.</b> The characteristics of <b>pseudonoise</b> were determined using a simple, one-dimensional model of spacecraft vibration. The statistical properties of the deviations of measurements from model truth were determined using this model {{and a range of}} different periods of sensor and rate measurements. This analysis indicates that the magnitude of <b>pseudonoise</b> depends on the ratio of the spacecraft vibration period to the time between gyro measurements and can be as much as twice the amplitude of the vibration. In cases where the vibration period and gyro or sensor measurement period are nearly commensurate, unexpected changes in <b>pseudonoise</b> occur...|$|E

40|$|Spread Spectrum {{systems are}} found in many flavours, used in many {{applications}} and have existed {{since the early days}} of radio communications. The properties of spread spectrum do however place restrictions on the design, and often make the implementation expensive and complex. When using spread spectrum to provide a basic communications infrastructure, many factors need to be considered. These include supplying the appropriate technology at the right cost. To achieve this a trade-off against performance is often required. One of the more difficult aspects of Spread Spectrum design is the synchronisation of the spreading waveform. The primary characteristic of <b>pseudonoise</b> sequence synchronisation is the need for two levels of synchronisation namely acquisition (course synchronisation) and tracking (fine synchronisation). In these networks (the term network is used to describe a circuit or system throughout the thesis.) a decision is required to switch between the two synchronisation modes. The two layer structure of the typical <b>pseudonoise</b> sequence synchronisation network can increase the overall cost of spread spectrum systems. The objective of the research was therefore to find solutions to reduce the overall cost and complexity of the synchronisation network. The synchronisation structure should perform acquisition and tracking in a single structure, and thereby be low cost. To achieve the primary objective of this dissertation a. mixture of theory, simulations and practical implementation was used. The basis of the investigation was a time-variant spectral evaluation of <b>pseudonoise</b> sequences. It is shown that by multiplying a differentiated <b>pseudonoise</b> sequence with another <b>pseudonoise</b> sequence, useful information is obtained that can form the basis of a synchronisation network...|$|E

40|$|When using {{parameter}} estimation methods based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) theory, {{it is common}} practice {{to assume that the}} unknown parameter values behave like a random process, such as a random walk, in order to guarantee their identifiability by the filter. The present work is the result of an ongoing effort to quantitatively describe the effect that the assumption of a fictitious noise (called <b>pseudonoise)</b> driving the unknown parameter values has on the parameter estimate convergence rate in filter-based parameter estimators. The initial approach is to examine a first-order system described by one state variable with one parameter to be estimated. The intent is to derive analytical results for this simple system that might offer insight into the effect of the <b>pseudonoise</b> assumption for more complex systems. Such results would make it possible to predict the estimator error convergence behavior {{as a function of the}} assumed <b>pseudonoise</b> intensity, and this leads to the natural application of the results to the design of filter-based parameter estimators.

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{sequential}} estimation method is {{proposed for the}} initial synchronization of <b>pseudonoise</b> (PN) signals derived from -sequences. This {{sequential estimation}} method is designed {{based on the principle}} of recursive soft-in/soft-out (SISO) decoding, and we refer to it as the recursive soft sequential estimation (RSSE) acquisition scheme. The RSSE acquisition scheme exhibits a complexity similar to that of a conventional-sequence generator, which increases only linearly with the number of stages in the -sequence generator. Our simulation results also show that the acquisition time of the proposed RSSE acquisition scheme is also linearly dependent on the number of stages in the -sequence generator. Owing to the above properties, the employment of the proposed RSSE acquisition scheme is beneficial for the acquisition of long -sequences.

40|$|Abstract—Accurate {{performance}} evaluation of direct-sequence <b>pseudonoise</b> code acquisition on Rayleigh fading channels is investigated in this paper. For fading channels the homogeneous Markov chain model, used {{to characterize the}} acquisition process over additive white Gaussian noise channels, is no longer valid due to the correlations between cell detections incurred by fading. Hence, the traditional direct and flow-graph approaches for {{performance evaluation}} of the code acquisition are not applicable to fading channels. In this paper, a new analysis is proposed for accurate evaluation of the acquisition performance on Rayleigh fading channels. The analysis is quite general and can include various search strategies, types of correlators, and test methods with different performance measures: probability mass function and/or moments of acquisition time.
