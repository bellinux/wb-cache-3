The invasion plan was eventually scrapped when authorities loyal to Victoriano Huerta detained a small American naval landing party (that had gone ashore to buy gasoline) in Tampico, Mexico, which led to {{what became known as}} the Tampico Affair.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the attacks came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who first <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Osama bin Laden in 1996. At that time, bin Laden and al-Qaeda were {{in a period of}} transition, having just {{relocated}} back to Afghanistan from Sudan. The 1998 African Embassy bombings and bin Laden's 1998 fatwā marked a turning point, as bin Laden became intent on attacking the United States.|$|E

5|$|As Tokyo Mew Mew {{became a}} viable project, Kodansha hired Reiko Yoshida {{to be the}} series' {{scenario}} writer and story supervisor. Yoshida and two other editors determined each volume's plot, created a scenario by adding stage directions and dialogue, and <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Ikumi. Ikumi added her own ideas and changes, creating the manuscript's first draft, which {{was taken to the}} publishers for final review and approval. This differs from most manga series, in which the manga writer also creates the scenarios and stories before submitting to their editor for approval.|$|E
5|$|COSSAC {{was charged}} with {{planning}} three operations: Operation Cockade, a deception operation to keep German forces pinned to the coast; Operation Rankin, a plan for measures {{to be taken in}} the case of a sudden German collapse; and Operation Overlord, a plan for a full-scale assault on north western Europe. Morgan and his staff worked on the Overlord plan throughout June and the first half of July 1943. He <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Chiefs of Staff Committee on 15 July. The plan set forth in detail the conditions under which the assault could be made, the area where a landing would be feasible, and the means by which a lodgement on the continent would be developed.|$|E

5|$|Hall i' th' Wood, now a museum, is a late mediaeval yeoman farmer's {{house built}} by Laurence Brownlow. Around 1637 it {{was owned by}} the Norris family, who added the stone west wing. In the 18th century it was divided up into tenements. Samuel Crompton lived and worked there. In the 19th century it {{deteriorated}} further until in 1895 it was bought by industrialist William Hesketh Lever, who restored it and <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Bolton Council in 1900.|$|E
5|$|In 226 BC, the {{citizens}} of Mantinea appealed to Cleomenes to expel the Achaeans from the city. One night, he and his troops crept into the citadel and removed the Achaean garrison. The king reinstated the ancient laws {{of the city and}} returned to Tegea. From Tegea, the Spartans advanced into Achaea, where Cleomenes hoped to force the League to face him in a pitched battle. Cleomenes advanced with his army to Dyme, where he was met by the entire Achaean army. In the Battle of Dyme, the Spartans routed the Achaean phalanx, killing many of the Achaeans and capturing others. Following this victory, Cleomenes captured the city of Lasium and <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Elians.|$|E
5|$|On the {{occasion}} of the World Expo held in Barcelona in 1888, Gaudí constructed the pavilion for the Compañía Trasatlántica, property of the Marquis of Comillas, in the Maritime Section of the event. He created it in a Granadinian Nazari style, with horseshoe arches and stucco decoration; the building survived until the Passeig Marítim was opened up in 1960. In the wake of the event he received a commission from Barcelona Council to restore the Saló de Cent and the grand stairs in Barcelona City Hall, as well as a chair for the queen Maria Cristina; only the chair was made, and Mayor Francesc Rius i Taulet <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Queen.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Caroline affair, President Harrison died and Vice-President John Tyler ascended to the presidency. Tyler {{resisted}} Clay's attempts {{to set the}} Whig agenda, and vetoed two bank bills against Crittenden's advice. Crittenden and the other Whigs in Tyler's cabinet—excepting Daniel Webster—resigned in protest of Tyler's deviation from the traditional Whig agenda. Crittenden's resignation was effective September 11, 1841. He returned to Kentucky with no political office and very little money. A group of his friends in Woodford County purchased his boyhood home and <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him as a gift on his return to Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|The {{propeller}} blade from Little's Sopwith Triplane was {{fitted with a}} clock in its hub by his fellow officers, who <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his widow; she transported it back to Australia in three pieces and it later went {{on display at the}} Australian War Memorial, along with his awards and the wooden cross of his original burial place at Nœux. The Sopwith Pup he flew with No.8 Squadron RNAS, N5182, was rebuilt to flying standard and in October 1976 led a flypast to commemorate the squadron's Diamond Jubilee, before going on permanent display at the Royal Air Force Museum, Hendon. One of the buildings of the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) in Canberra, opened in 1986, was named in Little's honour.|$|E
5|$|Thomas filmed a twelve-minute teaser for his {{new concept}} and <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> The CW. The teaser was later {{released}} on the Veronica Mars third season DVD and the internet. The clip begins in medias res with Veronica, {{pretending to be a}} high schooler, talking to a teacher. The teaser flashes back to her first FBI meeting, and the viewers discover that she is investigating the teacher for sexual abuse allegations. She successfully catches the teacher on camera, and at the FBI, she runs into a former acquaintance named Seth. She investigates a potential bomber with another novice agent, and they speak to a man who appears to be innocent. However, he points a gun at Veronica's partner as the clip ends.|$|E

5|$|While the {{monorail}} schemes {{were all}} abandoned, {{a scheme to}} create an underground tunnel link gained momentum. SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive — the body formed in 1969 to improve public transport for Manchester and its surrounding municipalities – promoted the Picc-Vic tunnel project. This was a proposal to link Piccadilly and Victoria stations via a tunnel under the city centre and enable train services to run across the Manchester conurbation. Greater Manchester County Council (GMC) inherited the project and <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the United Kingdom Government in 1974, but the council failed to secure the necessary funding and the project was abandoned in 1977. Inter-station links were provided by the Centreline shuttle bus service for many years.|$|E
5|$|Yingzao Fashi is a {{technical}} treatise on architecture and craftsmanship written by Li Jie, an architect and {{official at the}} Directorate of Buildings and Construction. Li completed the book in 1100, and <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Emperor Zhezong of Song {{in the last year}} of his reign. His successor, Emperor Huizong of Song, had Li's treatise officially published three years later, in 1103, for the benefit of foremen, architects, and literate craftsmen. The book was intended to provide standard regulations, to not only the engineering agencies of the central government, but also the many workshops and artisan families throughout China who could benefit from using a well-written government manual on building practices.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{technologies}} from the European Renaissance period were adopted by Russia rather early and subsequently perfected {{to become a}} part of a strong domestic tradition. Mostly these were military technologies, such as cannon casting adopted by at least the 15th century. The Tsar Cannon, which is the world's largest bombard by caliber, is a masterpiece of Russian cannon making. It was cast in 1586 by Andrey Chokhov and is notable for its rich, decorative relief. Another technology, that according to one hypothesis originally was brought from Europe by the Italians, resulted in the development of vodka, the national beverage of Russia. As early as 1386 Genoese ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae ("water of life") to Moscow and <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Grand Duke Dmitry Donskoy. The Genoese likely developed this beverage with the help of the alchemists of Provence, who used an Arab-invented distillation apparatus to convert grape must into alcohol. A Moscovite monk called Isidore used this technology to produce the first original Russian vodka c. 1430.|$|E

5|$|Barkas and Ayrton {{went out}} onto the beach dunes to sit and think. Barkas {{recalled}} the sacked Jasper Maskelyne, a stage magician who had briefly worked for him, saying he needed his vanishing tricks now. Ayrton agreed, suggesting they use Sunshields to make the tanks seem to be trucks, and vice versa. By {{the end of that}} afternoon they had typed up a plan and <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> de Guingand and Richardson. They proposed to create two dummy armoured brigades to deploy in the south. They would give the appearance of not being ready by making it seem the tanks had not moved from their forming-up areas (Murrayfield and Melting Pot). Dummy tanks would replace them there; while they would mimic trucks when they arrived in the forward Martello area.|$|E
5|$|From Bates, {{the picture}} passed to Walter Tyrell; {{another member of}} the Tyrell family, Edward, <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the National Gallery, London, in 1863, after it had failed to sell at an auction at Christie's in 1854. The {{painting}} was transferred to the Tate Gallery in 1929, although it was actually on loan to Derby Museum and Art Gallery between 1912 and 1947. It has been lent out for exhibitions to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1976, the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm in 1979–1980, and Paris (Grand Palais), New York (Metropolitan) and the Tate in London in 1990. It was reclaimed by the National Gallery from the Tate in 1986. They describe its condition as good, with minor alterations visible on some figures. It was last cleaned in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Ibrahim {{moved to}} secure control of Iraq region, but {{although}} he captured Kufa, Hasan ibn Sahl, {{who had made}} Wasit his base of operations, managed to get to Basra first. However, the governor of Egypt, Abd al-Aziz al-Azdi, recognized Ibrahim as Caliph. In Khurasan, the Sahlids at first downplayed the events at Baghdad, falsely informing al-Ma'mun that Ibrahim had merely been declared governor (amir) rather than Caliph. Finally, in December 817 Ali al-Rida succeeded in revealing to al-Ma'mun the real situation in Iraq, and convinced him that the turmoil in the Caliphate was far greater than the Sahlids <b>presented</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be, and that a reconciliation with Baghdad was necessary. Al-Ma'mun now resolved to assume personal control of his empire, and on 22 January 818 he left Marv and began a very slow journey west to Baghdad. Fadl ibn Sahl was murdered on 13 February, probably on al-Ma'mun's orders, although {{the rest of his}} family was spared a persecution like that which had befallen the Barmakids. Indeed, Hasan ibn Sahl was for the time being confirmed in his brother's position, and al-Ma'mun was betrothed to one of his daughters. Ali al-Rida also died during the march on 5 September, possibly of poison. His burial place at Sanabad, now known as Mashhad ("the place of martyrdom"), was to become a major Shi'a pilgrimage site.|$|E
