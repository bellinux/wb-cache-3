25|$|In {{cats and}} dogs whose {{gastrointestinal}} tract is infected with the tapeworms Dipylidium caninum or Taenia taeniaeformis, respectively; praziquantel is also often used in fixed combination with <b>pyrantel</b> <b>embonate</b> against the roundworms (ascarids): Toxocara cati and Toxascaris leonina. Praziquantel is also effective against Echinococcus multilocularis.|$|E
50|$|The {{benzimidazole}} compounds albendazole (brand names e.g., Albenza, Eskazole, Zentel and Andazol) and mebendazole (brand names e.g., Ovex, Vermox, Antiox and Pripsen) are {{the most}} effective. They work by inhibiting the microtubule function in the pinworm adults, causing glycogen depletion, thereby effectively starving the parasite. A single 100 milligram dose of mebendazole with one repetition after a week, is considered the safest, and is usually effective with cure rate of 96%. Mebendazole has no serious side effects, although abdominal pain and diarrhea have been reported. Pyrantel pamoate (also called <b>pyrantel</b> <b>embonate,</b> brand names e.g., Reese's Pinworm Medicine, Pin-X, Combantrin, Anthel, Helmintox, and Helmex) kills adult pinworms through neuromuscular blockade, and is considered {{as effective as the}} benzimidazole compounds and is used as a second-line medication. Other medications are piperazine, which causes flaccid paralysis in the adult pinworms, and pyrvinium pamoate (also called pyrvinium embonate), which works by inhibiting oxygen uptake of the adult pinworms. Pinworms located in the genitourinary system (in this case, female genital area) may require other drug treatments.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>pyrantel</b> <b>embonate</b> (1, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydro- 1 -methyl- 2 -(trans- 2 -(2 -thienyl) -vinyl) -pyrimidine embonic acid salt; Combantrin) was evaluated in 60 cases of hookworm infestation. They {{were divided into}} six groups of 10 cases. <b>Pyrantel</b> <b>embonate</b> was administered orally, in dosage schedules (randomized) of 100, 75, 50, 20, 15, and 10 mg/kg of body weight. The stool examination for hookworm ova and coproculture were positive in each case. The predominant species was Ancylostoma duodenale (in 58 patients). After treatment with <b>pyrantel</b> <b>embonate</b> the stool examination for hookworm ova and coproculture were negative on the 10 th and 15 th days in each group. The blood levels of the drug were significantly higher in patients receiving 100 and 75 mg/kg body weight. In groups A and B one patient experienced nausea and vomiting {{on the day of}} administration of drug. There were no abnormal changes in liver function tests or blood urea levels in any of the groups. Hence the optimum single dose of the drug effective against hookworm infestation is 10 mg/kg body weight, and further studies are required to evaluate the minimum effective dose of <b>pyrantel</b> <b>embonate...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{elucidate}} the pharmacological bases of oral administration of Securidaca longepedunculata (S. longepedunculata) root extract as an anthelmintic in folkloric medicine. MethodsAlbino mice were infected with infective third (L 3) larval stage of Heligmosomoides polygyrus (H. polygyrus) by esophageal intubation. Following {{establishment of the}} adult worms in the intestine, the mice were treated with 0 – 2 000 mg/kg body weight (bw) of methanolic root extract of S. longepedunculata and 100 mg/kg bw of <b>pyrantel</b> <b>embonate,</b> the reference drug in vivo. Bioactivity and larvicidal effects of the extract were tested by exposing brine shrimps (Artemia salina) to 0. 00 – 1. 00 mg/mL and the L 3 stage of Heligmosomoides contortus (H. contortus) and H. polygyrus to 0. 00 – 2. 50 mg/mL of the extract in vitro. ResultsThe percentage yield of the extract was 7. 13 % w/w dry matter. The brine shrimps toxicity bioassay resulted in an LC 50 of 74. 18 μg/mL. The extract had a significant, dose–dependent larvicidal effect on the L 3 stage of H. contortus and H. polygyrus with the terminal effect of 75 % and 70 % at the highest exposure concentrations, respectively. The extract however, {{did not affect the}} number of worm eggs per gram (epg) of fecal materials (P< 0. 05) and total worm burden (twb) of adult H. polygyrus in infected mice. Treatment with <b>pyrantel</b> <b>embonate</b> significant reduced both the fecal egg count and twb to 0 compared to the untreated control (P< 0. 05). ConclusionsThese results indicate that S. longepedunculata root extract contains potent bioactive compounds and has larvicidal effect on L 3 stage of H. contortus and H. polygyrus, substantiating its use as anthelmintic in alternative medicine...|$|E
40|$|Gastritis, vomition {{and weight}} loss are common in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Gastric spiral {{bacteria}} (Helicobacter spp.) and the very small, viviparous nematode Ollulanus tricuspis, a stomach worm of cats, {{are believed to be}} important causes. Three sibling cheetahs at Wellington Zoo, New Zealand, developed chronic vomiting, diarrhoea and debility. Their parents were both South African-born. Response to antibacterial treatment was poor. Endoscopic examinations revealed chronic lymphoplasmacytic gastritis and Ollulanus infection. Treatment with oxfendazole and <b>pyrantel</b> <b>embonate</b> resulted in clinical improvement; however, 1 cheetah, which died 7 months later {{as a result of a}} ruptured liver due to hepatic amyloidosis, still had Ollulanus worms present in her stomach. Ollulanus tricuspis is a significant cause of gastritis and vomiting in captive cheetahs, lions and tigers, as well as wild cougars and tigers. The parasite has not yet been found in sub-Saharan Africa. Because of the unusual characteristics of this parasite, the literature on its life history and techniques for diagnosis is reviewed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Kennel {{dogs are}} at the high risk of infections with {{intestinal}} and extra-intestinal helminths. Therefore, regular parasitological surveillance, a ppropriate treatment strategies and high quality standard of hygiene are required to guarantee the health and welfare of kennel dogs. The aim of t he {{present study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of helminth control in kennels using different broad-spectrum anthelmi ntics that are routinely used in canine veterinary practice. Particular attention was given to the field efficacy and ease-of-use of each product. Methods: The study was conducted in 3 public kennels in the Campania region (southern Italy). Eighteen boxes from each of the three kennels were selected for treatment based on faecal egg counts (FECs) at Day − 30. The treatments were conducted using tablets contain ing combinations of: i) milbemycin oxime and praziquantel (Milbemax®); ii) <b>pyrantel</b> <b>embonate,</b> febantel and p raziquantel (Drontal Plu s Flavour®), and; iii) pyrantel pamoate, oxantel pamoate and praziquantel (Nemex® POP). All dogs were treated on Day 0 and sampled on Days 0, 7, 14 and 21 for copromicroscopic analyses. The FLOTAC dual technique on pooled samples was used with efficacy determined by reduction in FECs. Results: At Day − 30 intestinal nematodes (hookworms, Toxocara, Trichuris) and cestodes (Dypilidium caninum) were found. Milbemax® showed 100...|$|E
40|$|Coproscopic {{examination}} of 505 dogs originating {{from the western}} or central part of Switzerland revealed the presence (prevalence data) of the following helminthes: Toxocara canis (7. 1 %), hookworms (6. 9 %), Trichuris vulpis (5. 5 %), Toxascaris leonina (1. 3 %), Taeniidae (1. 3 %), Capillaria spp. (0. 8 %), and Diphyllobothrium latum (0. 4 %). Potential risk factors for infection were identified by a questionnaire: dogs from rural areas significantly more often had hookworms and taeniid eggs in their feces when compared to urban family dogs. Access to small rodents, offal, and carrion was identified as risk factor for hookworm and Taeniidae, while feeding of fresh and uncooked meat {{did not result in}} higher prevalences for these helminths. A group of 111 dogs was treated every 3 months with a combined medication of <b>pyrantel</b> <b>embonate,</b> praziquantel, and febantel, and fecal samples were collected for coproscopy in monthly intervals. Despite treatment, the yearly incidence of T. canis was 32 %, while hookworms, T. vulpis, Capillaria spp., and Taeniidae reached incidences ranging from 11 to 22 %. Fifty-seven percent of the 111 dogs had helminth eggs in their feces at least once during the 1 -year study period. This finding implicates that an infection risk with potential zoonotic pathogens cannot be ruled out for the dog owner despite regular deworming four times a year...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of five daily fenbendazole (FBZ) treatments was tested against benzimidazole-resistant cyathostomins in naturally infected horses (n= 13). Horses {{were treated with}} <b>pyrantel</b> <b>embonate</b> (PYR) to remove adult strongyles followed, 7 days later, by a 5 -day course of FBZ. The PYR treatment produced an average faecal egg count reduction of 98 %. All samples were negative by faecal egg count 7 days {{after the start of}} the FBZ treatment. Positive egg counts were observed from 28 days after the start of FBZ treatment and all horses displayed positive faecal egg counts by 77 days after treatment. Strongyle eggs were harvested from the faeces of the horses prior to treatment and then weekly from 42 to 70 days post-treatment. DNA was obtained from eggs in groups of ten. A PCR-ELISA, based on species-specific differences in intergenic DNA sequences, was used to identify the presence of six cyathostomin species. In pre-treatment samples, Cyathostomum catinatum was detected in nine out of the 13 horses and Cylicostephanus longibursatus, Cylicostephanus goldi and Cylicocyclus nassatus, were found in samples from eight animals. Cylicocyclus ashworthi and Cylicocyclus insigne were not detected pre-treatment. After anthelmintic treatment, C. catinatum and C. longibursatus were most frequently detected, followed by C. nassatus, C. goldi and C. ashworthi. C. insigne was detected at only one time point in a sample from a single horse...|$|E
40|$|While {{anthelmintic}} {{resistance is}} now a widely recognized issue in the livestock industries, its existence within companion animal medicine has been rarely established conclusively. We undertook a placebo-controlled in vivo trial to measure the efficacy of <b>pyrantel</b> <b>embonate</b> against pooled isolates of the hookworm Ancylostoma caninum from Brisbane, Australia. A statistically significant fall in adult worm burden was observed among dogs in the pyrantel treatment group compared to the control dogs (178. 0 +/- 24. 5 versus 239. 7 +/- 14. 0; p= 0. 02), equating to an efficacy of just 25. 7 % (95 % Cl, 15. 0 - 35. 1 %), as based upon reduction in mean worm burden. Analysis of faecal egg count trends {{through the course of}} the study revealed that egg counts rose in both control and pyrantel-treated dogs, with a greater rise observed in the latter group (11. 6 +/- 8. 3 % versus 17. 3 +/- 7. 6 %; p= 0. 04), despite the decrease in adult worm numbers in this group. Our results indicate that high-level anthelmintic resistance does occur in companion animal medicine, and highlight the need for greater vigilance and more judicious use of anthelmintics in small animal practice. They further indicate that the faecal egg count reduction test needs to be used with caution with this parasite. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} {{adverse reactions}} to oral administration {{of a combination}} of praziquantel and <b>pyrantel</b> <b>embonate</b> or pyrantel pamoate, with or without oxantel embonate, in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Design: Retrospective case series and case-control study. Animals: 16 captive cheetahs with signs of adverse reaction to oral administration of praziquantel and pyrantel, with or without oxantel embonate (affected group), and 27 cheetahs without such reactions (unaffected group), all from 3 independent facilities. Procedures: Medical records and postmortem findings for affected cheetahs were reviewed and compared with those of unaffected animals. Anthelmintic doses administered, age, and sex of cheetahs were compared between groups. Results: 3 reactions in affected cheetahs were fatal, whereas the remainder ranged from mild to severe. Postmortem examination failed to reveal any disease processes or conditions to explain the deaths. No differences in anthelmintic dose were identified between affected and unaffected cheetahs for all facilities combined, and no correlation existed between dose and reaction severity. No association with sex was detected, but affected cheetahs were significantly younger than unaffected cheetahs. This difference was not significant after controlling for facility. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Cheetahs were concluded to have had an adverse reaction to the praziquantel-pyrantel combination because of temporal proximity of onset of clinical signs to dose administration, similarity of signs to those reported for toxicosis in other species for these drugs, and a lack of other disease process or environmental explanatory factors. A highly cautious approach to the use of this drug combination is recommended for cheetahs...|$|E
40|$|Human organic anion-transporting {{polypeptide}} 1 B 1 (OATP 1 B 1) and OATP 1 B 3 {{are important}} hepatic uptake transporters. Early assessment of OATP 1 B 1 / 1 B 3 -mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is therefore important for successful drug development. A promising approach for early screening and prediction of DDIs is computational modeling. In {{this study we}} aimed to generate a rapid, single Bayesian prediction model for OATP 1 B 1, OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 and OATP 1 B 3 inhibition. Besides our previously generated HEK-OATP 1 B 1 and HEK-OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 cells, we now generated and characterized HEK-OATP 1 B 3 cells. Using these cell lines we investigated the inhibitory potential of 640 FDA-approved drugs from a commercial library (10 μM) on the uptake of [3 H]-estradiol- 17 β-d-glucuronide (1 μM) by OATP 1 B 1, OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15, and OATP 1 B 3. Using a cut-off of ≥ 60 % inhibition, 8 % and 7 % of the 640 drugs were potent OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 inhibitors, respectively. Only 1 % of the tested drugs significantly inhibited OATP 1 B 3, which was not sufficient for Bayesian modeling. Modeling of OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 inhibition revealed that presence of conjugated systems and (hetero) cycles with acceptor/donor atoms in- or outside the ring enhance {{the probability of a}} molecule binding these transporters. The overall performance of the model for OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 was ≥ 80 %, including evaluation with a true external test set. Our Bayesian classification model thus represents a fast, inexpensive and robust means of assessing potential binding of new chemical entities to OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15. As such, this model may be used to rank compounds early in the drug development process, helping to avoid adverse effects in a later stage due to inhibition of OATP 1 B 1 and/or OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15.
