25|$|The Fournier RF7 was a single-seat motorglider {{designed}} and built in <b>prototype</b> <b>form</b> by René Fournier in France in 1970 and intended for series production by Sportavia-Pützer in Germany. It was a conventional motorglider design derived from Fournier's RF-4D, a low-wing cantilever monoplane with an engine mounted in tractor configuration in the nose. The sailplane-style undercarriage consisted of a retractable mainwheel, a fixed tailwheel, and small outriggers under each wing. Compared to the RF-4. the wings were shorter and the tailplane surfaces larger. The ailerons were also larger, and the RF7 was fully stressed for aerobatics.|$|E

However, as built in <b>prototype</b> <b>form,</b> the XSR had no means of channeling water away from the retractable sections, and water would inevitably leak into the cabin. No workable solution to the problem was found, and as such, the XSR model was scrapped. The XS, which did enter production, was offered with GM's more reliable (and no doubt more leak-resistant) Astroroof sliding sunroof instead. Air conditioning was standard.|$|E

40|$|The use of prototypes for {{situation}} representation allows {{solving the}} situation interpretation problem in modern situational and cognitive control systems. Here {{the problem of}} representation of complex situations characterized by the set of incomplete additional descriptions is solved with help of fuzzy prototypes. The {{case in which the}} initial information about the situation is a finite set of fuzzy or linguistic estimations of numerical features is addressed. It is proposed to represent a <b>prototype</b> in the <b>form</b> of a fuzzy vector with parametrically defined components. A method of <b>forming</b> <b>prototypes</b> hierarchy based on specification principle, which only requires storing limited set of simple, the most common prototypes, is proposed. Simple prototypes storing is organized in content addressable memory. To increase the memory access rate the problem of efficient distance estimation in the prototype space is solved. Complex composite <b>prototypes</b> are <b>formed</b> dynamically on the basis of activation vector of the simple prototypes. The time complexity of the corresponding algorithm is linearly dependent on the memory capacity. ????????????? ?????????? ??? ????????????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ???????? ????????????? ????????, ??????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ????????????? ? ???????????? ??????????. ???????? ?????? ????????????? ??????? ????????, ??????????????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????????? ???????? ? ??????? ???????? ??????????. ??????????????? ??????, ????? ???????? ??????????? ? ???????? ???????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ???? ??????????????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ?????????. ???????????? ???????????? ???????? ? ???? ????????? ???????, ?????????? ???????? ?????? ??????????????. ????????? ?????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ?????????????, ????????? ???????? ???? ????????????? ????????? ???????, ???????? ????? ??????????. ???????? ??????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ???? ??????, ?????????? ?? ???????????. ??? ?????????? ???????? ????????? ? ?????? ???????? ???????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????? ? ???????????? ??????????. ??????? ????????? ????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ??????????. ????????? ????????? ???????????????? ????????? ??????? ??????? ?? ?????? ??????...|$|R

2500|$|In 1999, Philip Rosedale formed Linden Lab {{with the}} {{intention}} of developing computer hardware to allow people to become immersed in a virtual world.

Although he was familiar with the metaverse of Neal Stephenson's novel Snow Crash, Rosedale has said that his vision of virtual worlds predates that book, and that he conducted early virtual world experiments during his college years at the University of California, San Diego, where he studied physics.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{damaging}} aspect to the Luftwaffe of targeting London was {{the increase in}} range. The Bf 109E escorts had a limited fuel capacity resulting in only a 660km (410 mile) maximum range solely on internal fuel, and when they arrived had only 10 minutes of flying time before turning for home, leaving the bombers undefended by fighter escorts. Its eventual stablemate, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190A, was flying only in <b>prototype</b> <b>form</b> {{in the summer of}} 1940; the first 28 Fw 190s were not delivered until November 1940. [...] The Fw 190A-1 had a maximum range of 940km (584 miles) on internal fuel, 40% greater than the Bf 109E. The Messerschmitt Bf 109E-7 corrected this deficiency by adding a ventral centre-line ordnance rack to take either an SC 250 bomb or a standard 300 litre Luftwaffe drop tank to double the range to 1,325km (820mi). The ordnance rack was not retrofitted to earlier Bf 109Es until October 1940.|$|E

Production of the Thunderbird began later on in 1954 on September 9 with the car beginning sales as a 1955 model on October 22, 1954.

Starting in 1968 the Grifo was also available with Chevrolet's 427 cubic inch big-block V-8; this version {{was known as the}} Grifo 7 litri and was easily recognized by the broad air inlet on the hood. Later-day Grifos, the Series II, featured concealed headlights and a slightly modified front area.|$|R
50|$|Because {{people have}} self-concepts that {{are derived from}} a role they define for {{themselves}} {{within the context of}} a group, when staying within their roles, intergroup similarities are accentuated while intergroup differences are diminished.

Shared information and views are discussed more often than novel and unshared information within a group, therefore a norm is established where the majority views are perpetuated and others silenced. This norm is fluid and changing according to different contexts, but those within the group who want to keep up with the majority views in all matters have to keep an active role in affirming the views of the in-group in contest to out-groups.|$|R

2500|$|It may {{be noted}} that railgun {{velocities}} generally fall {{within the range of}} those achievable by two-stage light-gas guns; however, the latter are generally only considered to be suitable for laboratory use while railguns are judged to offer some potential prospects for development as military weapons. Another light gas gun, the Combustion Light Gas Gun in a 155mm <b>prototype</b> <b>form</b> was projected to achieve 2500m/s with a [...]70 caliber barrel. In some hypervelocity research projects, projectiles are [...] "pre-injected" [...] into railguns, to avoid the need for a standing start, and both two-stage light-gas guns and conventional powder guns have been used for this role. In principle, if railgun power supply technology can be developed to provide safe, compact, reliable, combat survivable, and lightweight units, then the total system volume and mass needed to accommodate such a power supply and its primary fuel can become less than the required total volume and mass for a mission equivalent quantity of conventional propellants and explosive ammunition. Arguably such technology has been matured with the introduction of the EMALS aircraft launch system (albeit that railguns require much higher system powers, because roughly similar energies must be delivered in a few milliseconds, as opposed to a few seconds) [...] Such a development would then convey a further military advantage in that the elimination of explosives from any military weapons platform will decrease its vulnerability to enemy fire.|$|E
