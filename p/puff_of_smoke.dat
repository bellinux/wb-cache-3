25|$|According to a {{majority}} of the interviewed witnesses, the airplane suddenly rolled to the left until the wings were perpendicular to the ground. The aircraft then descended in a nose-down attitude and disappeared from sight behind trees near the airport. One witness told investigators that they saw a <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> emanate from the aircraft prior to or subsequent to the airplane rolling to the left. Others reported loud engine noises described as a squeal, whine, or an overspeeding or accelerating engine during the last moments of the flight, although they said that these noises seemed to have stopped, or at least faded before the aircraft impacted with flat ground two miles short of the runway.|$|E
25|$|By 13:35, Winslow {{reached a}} point {{approximately}} 1,500 yards from her quarry when a white <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> from Antonio Lópezs bow gun signaled {{the beginning of an}} artillery duel which lasted one hour and 20 minutes. Winslow responded with her 1-pounders. The Spanish concentrated their efforts on Winslow, and she soon received several direct hits. The first shot to score on the torpedo boat destroyed both her steam and manual steering gear. Her crew tried to rig an auxiliary steering system, but she swung broadside to the enemy and a shot pierced her hull near the engine room and knocked the port main engine out of commission. She maneuvered with her remaining engine to evade enemy fire and maintained a steady return fire with her 1-pounders. Wilmington and Hudson brought their guns to bear on the Spanish ship and shore, and the combined fire of the three American warships put the Spanish tugboat out of action while several waterfront buildings caught fire.|$|E

500|$|In one scene, Reeves needed Price {{to shoot}} his flintlock between {{the ears of}} the horse he was riding. When Price {{realised}} that Reeves had ordered that an actual blank charge was to be used so the weapon's <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> would be visible, he shouted, [...] "What? You want the gun to go bang between the ears of this fucking nag? How do you think he's going to react?" [...] However, Reeves insisted and, when the gun went off, the horse reared and sent Price tumbling onto the ground. Price was not hurt but he was extremely angered by the incident.|$|E
500|$|News {{coverage}} of the battle produced television footage of ZNG air defence artillery at Zečevo firing at a Yugoslav Air Force Soko J-21 Jastreb and scoring a hit on another J-21 using a guided missile. The footage, ending in shouts claiming that both of the planes were downed, {{became one of the}} most significant pieces of material in terms of propaganda and morale in Croatia. Nonetheless, the footage proved controversial, since the first plane is not shown falling to the ground or into the sea, but diving towards the horizon after giving away a <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> [...] variously interpreted as smoke caused by the plane's cannon fire or anti-aircraft fire damage. While the first J-21 downing remains unconfirmed, the second J-21, piloted by Croat Valter Juršić of the 240th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron, was shot down by Neven Livajić using a 9K38 Igla and wreckage of the plane was retrieved.|$|E

500|$|The protagonist is also {{challenged}} {{in his or}} her quest by 20types of creatures. [...] By moving the joystick while pressing its button or by performing the equivalent keyboard commands, the player defends the protagonist with four styles of attacks: a low slash, a high chop, a kick, and a spinning neck chop. [...] The life of the combatants are represented by gauges at the top corners of the screen. [...] Successful attacks on a character reduce its gauge and the character is killed when its life is reduced to zero. [...] A well-timed neck chop (or the bites of certain monsters) decapitates the opponent, killing it instantly. [...] Monsters disappear in a <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> when killed, reappearing with a full life gauge in the same room some time later. [...] Although the player character likewise reappears fully rejuvenated in the room after being killed, he or she can only do so for a limited number of times. [...] This limit (number of lives) is represented in the form of globes at the top centre of the screen. [...] The protagonist increases his or her number of lives by collecting skulls that are scattered throughout the game world.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{is one of}} Naruto Uzumaki's {{signature}} techniques, {{invented by}} Tobirama Senju with the instructions placed in a forbidden scroll that Naruto was tricked into stealing by a ninja named Mizuki. Unlike regular clone jutsus, the Shadow Clones are physical clones of the user capable of cohabiting with their surroundings, performing jutsu, and engaging in battle before dispersing in a <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> when sufficiently damaged or at the user's discretion. When clones are created, the user's chakra is evenly distributed among them, making it easy for the user to quickly expend their chakra. While most ninja limit themselves to only making a few clones because of this, Naruto can create thousands of clones due to his large amount of chakra. He can also combine it with his [...] "Sexy Jutsu" [...] to produce the [...] "Harem Jutsu". During Part II, having been unaware of this fact until Kakashi explains it, Naruto learns that any knowledge his clone possesses will be transferred {{to him at the}} moment that the jutsu is canceled. This fact enables Naruto {{to make use of the}} Jutsu in training to gain years of experience in days, and to cover more ground by using his Shadow Clones as scouts.|$|E

Les Watt wrote to The Australian: [...] "Let me assure you and your readers that Ryan did kill Hodson." [...] Watt spoke out after reading Philip Opas' comments and the latter's autobiography. Watt {{was one of four}} witnesses to testify seeing Ryan fire a shot. Watt said that it might well be proper for Opas to leave the bar as his emotional involvement with the case had certainly distorted the facts, leading as it had to the suggestion that Ryan might not have fired the shot that killed Hodson. Watt, on the contrary, said that he saw Ryan take aim and fire and then saw Hodson fall flat on his face and not move. [...] "It was a sickening sight. I also witnessed a slight <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> come from the carbine Ryan used. This was probably {{as a result of a}} bullet passing through a well-oiled barrel bore." ...|$|E
