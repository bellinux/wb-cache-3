40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{inflation}} in a competitive search model where each buyer’s utility is private information, and money is essential. The equilibrium is efficient at the Friedman rule, but inflation creates an inefficiency in the terms of trade. Buyers experience a preference shock after they are matched with a seller, and thus they have a precautionary motive for holding money. Sellers, who compete to attract buyers, post non-linear <b>price</b> <b>schedules.</b> As inflation rises, sellers post relatively flat <b>price</b> <b>schedules,</b> which reduce the need for precautionary balances. These <b>price</b> <b>schedules</b> induce buyers with a low desire to consume to purchase inefficiently high quantities because of the low marginal cost of purchasing goods.

40|$|A {{standard}} {{presumption of}} market microstructure models is that competition between risk neutral market makers inevitably leads to <b>prices</b> <b>schedules</b> that leave market makers zero expected profits conditional {{on the order}} flows. This paper shows that this result does not hold when traders can split orders between market makers. When traders can split orders, market makers set less competitive <b>price</b> <b>schedules</b> that earn them strictly positive profits and hence raise trading costs. Indeed, if noise traders have completely inelastic demands (as in Kyle 1985), market makers want to set arbitrarily uncompetitive price schedules: no equilibrium exists. Our results imply that if feasible, regulation banning order splitting on an exchange is optimal. Analogous results obtain when <b>price</b> <b>schedules</b> are set by any finite number of agents who compete using limit orders. Further, since limit orders, by their very nature, are split against incoming market orders, the analysis suggests that regulated market maker competition will provide better prices. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{second degree}} price {{discrimination}} or quantity discrimination customers are charged different prices {{based on how}} much they buy. There is a single <b>price</b> <b>schedule</b> for all consumers but the prices {{vary depending on the}} quantity of the good bought. The theory of second degree price discrimination is a consumer is willing to buy only a certain quantity of a good at a given price. Companies know that consumer’s willingness to buy decreases as more units are purchased. The task for the seller is to identify these price points and to reduce the price once one is reached in the hope that a reduced price will trigger additional purchases from the consumer. For example, sell in unit blocks rather than individual units.|$|E
