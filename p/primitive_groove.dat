60|$|There is {{not much}} {{apparent}} resemblance between a barndoor Fowl and the Dog who protects the farm-yard. Nevertheless the student of development finds, {{not only that the}} chick commences its existence as an egg, primarily identical, in all essential respects, with that of the Dog, but that the yelk of this egg undergoes division--that the <b>primitive</b> <b>groove</b> arises, and that the contiguous parts of the germ are fashioned, by precisely similar methods, into a young chick, which, at one stage of its existence, is so like the nascent Dog, that ordinary inspection would hardly distinguish the two.|$|E
60|$|The {{history of}} the {{development}} of any other vertebrate animal, Lizard, Snake, Frog, or Fish, tells the same story. There is always, to begin with, an egg having the same essential structure as that of the Dog:--the yelk of that egg always undergoes division, or 'segmentation' as it is often called: the ultimate products of that segmentation constitute the building materials for the body of the young animal; and this is built up round a <b>primitive</b> <b>groove,</b> in the floor of which a notochord is developed. Furthermore, there is a period in which the young of all these animals resemble one another, not merely in outward form, but in all essentials of structure, so closely, that the differences between them are inconsiderable, while, in their subsequent course, they diverge more and more widely from one another. And it is a general law, that, the more closely any animals resemble one another in adult structure, the longer and the more intimately do their embryos resemble one another: so that, for example, the embryos of a Snake and of a Lizard remain like one another longer than do those of a Snake and of a Bird; and the embryo of a Dog and of a Cat remain like one another for a far longer period than do those of a Dog and a Bird; or of a Dog and an Opossum; or even than those of a Dog and a Monkey.|$|E
6000|$|The {{progressive}} {{development of}} any vertebrate from the ovum or minute embryonic egg affords {{one of the}} most marvellous chapters in Natural History. We see the contents of the ovum undergoing numerous definite changes, its interior dividing and subdividing till it consists of a mass of cells, then a groove appears marking out the median line or vertebral column of the future animal, and thereafter are slowly developed the various essential organs of the body. After describing in some detail what takes place {{in the case of the}} ovum of the dog, Professor Huxley continues: [...] "The history of the development of any other vertebrate animal, lizard, snake, frog, or fish tells the same story. There is always to begin with, an egg having the same essential structure as that of the dog; the yelk of that egg undergoes division or segmentation, as it is called, the ultimate products of that segmentation constitute the building materials for the body of the young animal; and this is built up round a <b>primitive</b> <b>groove,</b> in the floor of which a notochord is developed.

40|$|Structural {{model for}} B-DNA helix The DNA helices are taken as the {{canonical}} B-form and are produced from the previously developed <b>grooved</b> <b>primitive</b> model [1]. The <b>grooved</b> <b>primitive</b> model retains {{a high degree}} of realistic helical structure and phosphate charge distribution of DNA [2], and is tractable for analytical statistical mechanical theories [3]-[5]. We use the B-form DNA helix since it is the most common and stable form over a wide range of ionic conditions and sequences [6, 7]. In the <b>grooved</b> <b>primitive</b> model, for each nucleotide backbone, the phosphate is represented by a charged sphere with the charge placed {{at the center of the}} sphere, and the neutral groups are represented by a neutral sphere. Both spheres have radii of 2. 1 Å. The radius is determined from all-atom simulations such that the <b>grooved</b> <b>primitive</b> model gives the same detailed ion distribution as the all-atom computation [1]. In the <b>grooved</b> <b>primitive</b> model, a base pair is represented by five spheres: one large central sphere with radius 4 Å, two phosphate spheres and two neutral spheres [1]. The centers of the large central spheres are on the axis of DNA helices with equal spacing, and the phosphate spheres are placed at the centers of the phosphate groups, while the neutral spheres lie between the phosphate spheres and the central large sphere. The coordinates of the phosphate spheres (ρs i,θs i, zs i) are determined from the atomic coordinates of B-DNA from X-ray measurements [2]: ρs i = 8. 9 (Å); θs i = θs 0 +i 36 ◦; zs i = zs 0 +i 3. 4 (Å), where s = 1, 2 denotes the two strands and i = 1, 2, [...] . N denotes the nucleotides on each strand. The parameter...|$|R

25|$|In the male, by {{the greater}} {{growth of the}} pelvic portion of the cloaca, a longer urethra is formed, and the {{primitive}} opening is carried forward with the phallus, but it still ends at the corona glandis. Later, this opening, which {{is located on the}} dorsal side of the penis, closes from behind forward. Meanwhile, the urethral plate of the glans breaks down centrally to form a median groove continuous with the <b>primitive</b> ostium. This <b>groove</b> also closes from behind forward, leaving only a small pipe running {{in the middle of the}} penis. Thus, the urogenital opening is shifted forward to the end of the glans.|$|R

50|$|The avian blastocoel is {{important}} {{during the development}} of the primitive streak. The ingression of the endodermal precursor cells form the epiblast into the blastocoel and the migration of lateral cells of the posterior epiblast towards the center form the early primitive streak. As these cells converge inward, a depression forms called the <b>primitive</b> <b>groove</b> and functions as an opening through which cells travel into the blastocoel. As cells migrate into the blastocoel, they undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation.|$|E
50|$|In chick development, the {{primitive}} knot starts {{as a regional}} knot of cells that forms on the blastodisc immediately anterior to where the outer layer of cells will begin to migrate inwards - an area known as {{the primitive}} streak, which is involved with Koller's sickle. Posterior to the node is the primitive pit, where {{the cells of the}} epiblast (the upper layer of embryonic cells) initially begin to invaginate. This invagination expands posteriorly into the <b>primitive</b> <b>groove</b> as the cells layers continue to move into the space between the embryonic cells and the yolk. This differentiates the embryo into the three germ layers - endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. The primitive knot migrates posteriorly as gastrulation proceeds, eventually being absorbed into the tail bud.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{characterize}} by computer simulation the free-energy difference between B- and Z-DNA in saline solutions. We use a new scheme to rigorously calculate the electrostatic contribution and we use it to test the theoretical predictions for a so-called ‘empty’ DNA model (a set of charged hard spheres placed at the phosphate positions). The ions are considered as charged spheres in a continuum medium of dielectric constant {{equal to that of}} water. Also, we investigate the total free-energy difference for three different models differing exclusively in the degree of definition of the molecular shape. The comparison against experimental data shows that a precise shape is not required to give acceptable results. Finally, we use a simple <b>grooved</b> <b>primitive</b> model to study the effect of the ionic size and the ionic charges. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSerum {{response}} factor (SRF) gene expression in avian embryonic muscle lineages plays {{a central role}} in activating α-actin gene activity. In early stage HH 6 avian embryos, SRF mRNA expression showed strong localization to the neural <b>groove,</b> <b>primitive</b> streak, lateral plate mesoderm, and Hensen's node, while distinct SRF expression was seen later in the neural folds and the somites by HH stage 8. SRF transcripts appeared in the precardiac splanchnic mesoderm in stage HH 9 embryos and was detected at higher levels in the myocardium, somites, and lateral mesoderm of HH 11 embryos. SRF antibody staining demonstrated significant SRF protein accumulation in the myocardium of the developing heart and the myotomal portion of somites. During primary myogenesis in culture, SRF transcripts and nuclear SRF protein content increased about 40 -fold, as primary myoblasts withdrew from the cell cycle, reaching their highest levels prior to the upregulation of the skeletal α-actin gene. A dominant-negative SRF mutant, SRFpm 1, which inhibited DNA binding, but not dimerization of monomeric SRF subunits, blocked transcriptional activation of a skeletal α-actin promoter–luciferase reporter gene during myogenesis. Transcriptional blockade was reversed by co-transfections of a wild-type SRF expression vector, but was not rescued by the expression of other myogenic factors, such as MyoD and Mef- 2 C. Thus, SRF displayed an embryonic expression pattern restricted primarily to striated muscle cell lineages, in which increased mass of nuclear SRF was obligatory for α-actin gene transcription...|$|R
40|$|Continued {{advances}} {{in the field of}} histo pathology (and cyto pathology) {{over the past two decades}} have resulted in dramatic changes in the manner in which these disciplines are now practiced. This is especially true in the setting of a large university hospital where the role of pathologists as clinicians (diagnosticians), undergraduate and postgraduate educators, and researchers has evolved considerably. The world around us has changed significantly during this period bringing about a considerable change in our lifestyles and the way we live. This is the world of the internet and the world-wide web, the world of Google and Wikipedia, of Youtube and Facebook where anyone can obtain any information one desires at the push of a button. The practice of histo (and cyto) pathology has also evolved in line with these changes. For those practicing this discipline in a poor, developing country these changes have been breathtaking. This is an attempt to document these changes as experienced by histo (and cyto) pathologists practicing in the biggest center for Histopathology in Pakistan, a developing country in South Asia with a large (180 million) and ever growing population. The Section of Histopathology, Department of Pathology and Microbiology at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) in Karachi, Pakistan’slargest city has since its inception in the mid- 1980 s transformed the way histopathology is practiced in Pakistan by incorporating modern methods and rescuing histopathology in Pakistan from the <b>primitive</b> and outdated <b>groove</b> in which it was stuck for decades. It set histopathology in Pakistan firmly on the path of modernity and change which are essential for better patient management and care through accurate and complete diagnosis and more recently prognostic and predictive information as well...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the more}} {{advanced}} ichthyosaurs, Utatsusaurus has no dorsal fin and has a broad skull. The snout gently tapers, compared to the more rounded one of more derived ichthyopterygians.The postorbital underlaps the elongate posterior process of the postfrontal. This is an evident plesiomorphic condition for ichthyopterygians. For {{the size of the}} skull, the teeth are rather small, and arranged in a <b>primitive</b> <b>groove.</b> They have longitudinal grooves and were first thought to be longer and more acute than Grippia, which is a closely related ichthyosaur. But, after that, it was reported that they were rather bluntly pointed and robust by reexamining the holotype. Utatsusaurus had small fins, with five digits. In addition, those digits have up to five extra finger bones, which is referred to as hyperphalangy. The tail had a long low fin, suggesting that the animal swam by undulation, rather than using its paddles and tail.|$|E
50|$|The {{primitive}} streak is {{key in the}} development of the major body axes. The <b>primitive</b> <b>groove</b> forms as a depression in the {{primitive streak}} as it is developing, and allows a space for migrating cells to move into the deeper layers of the embryo. Cells migrate by entering through the dorsal side and moving toward the ventral side of the avian embryo, separating the left and right sections of the embryo. The primitive pit in Hensen’s node, at the anterior end of the primitive streak, allows cells to enter which will form the notochord and prechordal plate. Cells that move through the center of the streak will become the heart and kidneys. The lateral plate and the extraembryonic mesoderm arise from the cells that enter at the posterior end of the primitive streak. Epiblast cells near the primitive streak form the neural plate and other dorsal structures, while the epiblast cells far from the streak become epidermis.|$|E
50|$|The {{embryonic}} disk becomes oval {{and then}} pear-shaped, the wider end being directed forward. Near the narrow, posterior end, an opaque streak, called the primitive streak, makes its appearance and extends along {{the middle of}} the disk for about one-half of its length; at the anterior end of the streak there is a knob-like thickening termed the primitive node or knot, (known as Hensen's knot in birds). A shallow groove, the <b>primitive</b> <b>groove,</b> appears {{on the surface of the}} streak, and the anterior end of this groove communicates by means of an aperture, the blastopore, with the yolk sac. The primitive streak is produced by a thickening of the axial part of the ectoderm, the cells of which multiply, grow downward, and blend with those of the subjacent endoderm. From the sides of the primitive streak a third layer of cells, the mesoderm, extends laterally between the ectoderm and endoderm; the caudal end of the primitive streak forms the cloacal membrane. The blastoderm now consists of three layers, named from without inward: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm; each has distinctive characteristics and gives rise to certain tissues of the body. For many mammals, it is sometime during formation of the germ layers that implantation of the embryo in the uterus of the mother occurs.|$|E
40|$|In the {{gastrula}} stage embryo, the epiblast migrates {{toward the}} primitive streak and ingresses through the <b>primitive</b> <b>groove.</b> Subsequently, the ingressing epiblast cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and differentiate into the definitive endoderm and mesoderm during gastrulation. However, the developmental mechanisms {{at the end}} of gastrulation have not yet been elucidated. Histological and genetic analyses of the ventral ectodermal ridge (VER), a derivative of the primitive streak, were performed using chick and mouse embryos. The analyses showed a continued cell movement resembling gastrulation associated with EMT during the early tailbud stage of both embryos. Such gastrulation-like cell movement was gradually attenuated by the absence of EMT during tail development. The kinetics of the expression pattern of noggin (Nog) and basal membrane degradation adjacent to the chick and the mouse VER indicated a correlation between the temporal and/or spatial expression of Nog and the presence of EMT in the VER. Furthermore, Nog overexpression suppressed EMT and arrested ingressive cell movement in the chick VER. Mice mutant in noggin displayed dysregulation of EMT with continued ingressive cell movement. These indicate that the inhibition of Bmp signaling by temporal and/or spatial Nog expression suppresses EMT and leads to the cessation of the ingressive cell movement from the VER {{at the end of}} gastrulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of rabbit blastocysts {{and their}} uterine environment after ovariectomy was studied; the experimental period after ovariectomy varied from 17 to 26 hr. Most {{of the experiments}} were concerned with blastocysts recovered from rabbits spayed at 6 days; a few relate to embryos from animals spayed on day 5 or 7 of gestation. Ovariectomy resulted in variable, often considerable, embryonic loss. Following bilateral ovariectomy at 6 - 6 = 1 / 2, implantation on day 7 was completely prevented; those blastocysts which survived showed evidence of expansion and differentiation during the interval after ovariectomy. This provided an opportunity (1) to assess the stage of development, and mitotic activity, as well as certain biochemical characteristics, in embryos surviving ovariectomy, and (2) to use the free-lying 7 -day-old blastocysts for culture experiments. It was found that mitotic activity went on in blastocysts after ovari-ectomy. Upon transfer to suitable culture media the unimplanted 7 -day-old blastocysts continued to grow and differentiate, the most advanced stage observed {{at the end of}} a 24 hr. period of incubation in vitro being the development of blood islands, <b>primitive</b> <b>groove,</b> and head process. The fresh weight, and the content of bicarbonate and glucose of the 7 -day-old unimplanted blastocysts differed little from those of normally implanted blastocysts of the same age; their content of lactate, however, was distinctly lower. Carbonic anhydrase activity after spaying was fully maintained in the endometrium which showed little involutional change either on gross or on microscopical examination...|$|E
