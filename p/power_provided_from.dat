30|$|On {{the other}} side, the battery {{needs to be}} charged and discharged. The control system {{provides}} the required duty cycle when there is excess power production from the PV module. The duty cycle changes when the PV modules cannot produce enough power to supply power from the battery to the load. This type of architecture is called active hybrids (Blackwelder and Dougal 2004). A semi-active hybrid structure is more economically viable as explained in Song et al. (2015), but a more precise control strategy can only be adopted in the active hybrid as explained in Zhang et al. (2014). Current in this converter {{should be able to}} reverse to achieve this feat. There are several converter options that meet this requirement, but the selection of bidirectional converter is governed by the battery property. The battery of choice is lithium ion due to its highest energy density among the currently available battery technologies (ICCNEXERGY 2015). A lithium ion 3 S battery pack usually has an operating range from 11.1 to 12.6  V, which necessitates a buck-boost converter with the 12  V load, which will create unnecessary complications in controlling schemes. Thus, a 4 S battery pack is considered, which has a usual operation range from 14.8 to 16.8  V. The entire operating region of the battery pack is higher than the load requirement. Thus, a converter with bidirectional current flow (Drolia et al. 2003), a bidirectional converter, is used where the high side is connected to the lithium ion battery. Similar to the buck converter, an extra inductor is used to limit current ripples. The PI controller of the bidirectional converter forces the entire system to operate at two different operating conditions. When the PV has enough power, then i_L_B_Ref input of this controller is set to a negative value, which denotes a safe charging current for the battery. Moreover, this safe charging current should be less than the difference between maximum current output of the module and the printer requirement. This prevents the battery from sinking too much current that may prevent a proper 3 -D printer operation. The required current input changes according to the <b>power</b> <b>provided</b> <b>from</b> the PV to ensure an uninterrupted printing process. In Karunarathne et al. (2011), this type of different operation of a same controller is used. Such operation of the controller fulfills the design requirement statement of 2, 3, 4 and 5. Thus, it can be considered that the designed system fulfills all the aimed goals.|$|E
40|$|New {{technologies}} of non-lethal weapons (NLW) are under military research and development, {{mainly in the}} USA. Due to incomplete information, judgement under criteria {{of the laws of}} warfare or of human rights is hampered. This study analyses four potential NLW technologies which are based on physics to provide reliable information for such assessment. The Active Denial System (ADS) produces a beam of electromagnetic millimetre waves; such radiation is absorbed in the upper 0. 4 mm of skin. The beam stays approximately 2 m wide out to many hundreds of metres. With a power of 100 kilowatts, the beam can heat the skin of target subjects to pain-producing temperature levels within seconds. With a prototype weapon, mounted in a military multi-purpose vehicle, the effects have been tested on hundreds of volunteers. In order to produce pain while preventing burn injury, the power and duration of emission for one trigger event is controlled by a software program. Model calculations show that with the highest power setting, second- and third-degree burns with complete dermal necrosis will occur after less than 2 seconds. Even with a lower setting of power or duration there is the possibility for the operator to re-trigger immediately. Collateral damage is not much of a problem. Use in armed conflict would bring much less injury than flamethrowers which count as legitimate weapons. However, such use is not very probable because the system is large, needs to be exposed for action and is vulnerable to many kinds of light weapons. More likely is its use for internal security, by occupation forces against uprisings etc. Taking into account that the operator may be up to one km away, in such circumstances overdoses with severe burn injuries could only be prevented if technical devices would reliably limit the skin temperature, i. e., would limit beam power or duration depending on target distance and would prevent re-triggering on the same person before a certain cooling time has passed. The Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL), to be carried by a transport aircraft, is to emit an infrared laser beam of 300 kilowatts <b>power,</b> <b>provided</b> <b>from</b> a chemical reaction. Via a 0. 5 m wide transmitting and directing mirror, the beam can be focused – under ideal conditions – to a spot of 0. 1 - 0. 2 m size over 10 km and more. With the 100 -fold power of a stove plate applied over a similar area, wood or textiles would start burning and metal would melt through after fractions of a second, under usual atmospheric conditions on the order of one second. Strong turbulence will limit the range, fog, dust or heavy rain can reduce it markedly. With fuel for about 40 seconds of radiating on board and dwell times below a second, the beam will often be directed and fired automatically. The ATL can destroy equipment and kill people, it is not a non-lethal weapon. Its usage in armed conflict against combatants could be compared with flamethrowers which are accepted under international humanitarian law. Compared to other means of applying force at many kilometres distance (artillery, bombs), the ATL would allow much more discriminating destruction. The ATL has limitations: the fuel is sufficient only for around 100 “shots”. A clear line of sight is also needed, preventing action through fog or heavy rain and exposing the carrier aircraft. Due to its size, long range and drastic effects, the ATL is not suitable for police. In peaceenforcing operations it could allow more precise targeting than possible with artillery or guided bombs, but collateral damage is nevertheless possible to several metres from an exploding tyre, fuel tank or munition. The concept of the Pulsed Energy Projectile (PEP) is to use short, powerful, infrared laser pulses to produce a mechanical impulse. The laser works with a chemical reaction. If the pulse intensity is high enough, the uppermost target layer is explosively vaporised and the vapour heated to a plasma which absorbs the rest of the pulse and produces a lasersupported detonation wave. This shock wave exerts a mechanical impulse on the target. With a range of 0. 5 - 2 km, the PEP is to be used against humans and equipment in armed conflict and law enforcement. The ratio between impulse and laser-pulse energy is such that for a relatively high pulse energy of 1 kilojoule requiring a big, heavy laser (1 - 2 metres, hundreds of kilograms), the mechanical impulse with 0. 1 newton-second is one to two orders of magnitude below the one from a rubber baton or an existing blunt-impact munition. Multiple pulses in fast sequence would add, but then the target would be ablated to corresponding greater depth, measuring by millimetres. If bare skin were hit, bad wounds would ensue. In addition, permanent hearing damage may occur from the shock wave even from one laser pulse. If the eye is hit, serious injury by cornea ablation or mechanical impulse is probable. In clear, non-turbulent air the spot focus will remain at a few cm size out to a few kilometres, but dense fog or rain will strongly limit propagation. The PEP is a lethal weapon. It could be used selectively, without significant potential of collateral damage. Comparison with penetrating projectiles or flamethrowers shows that its use in armed conflict would not a priori contradict the rules of warfare. However, it should be investigated if severe wounds produced on bare skin, in particular to the face, and the loss of vision from eye injury may count as unnecessary suffering or superfluous injury. The PEP has limitations. It needs a clear line of sight to the target so that it will be exposed and cannot work in thick fog or rain, it will be big, heavy, complex and expensive. Due to its size, range and potential injurious effects, the PEP would neither be appropriate as a weapon for law enforcement nor for peace-enforcing operations. For mechanical blows and pain, blunt-impact projectiles provide much easier, much cheaper options with less risk of injury. The Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) was developed in a weapon programme but is now denoted as a hailing and warning device. It is a flat loudspeaker which due to its diameter of 0. 8 m has a relatively high directivity (beam opening angle 5 - 15 &# 1048689;). It transmits mainly high frequencies (above 1 kilohertz); voice messages have a range above 500 m, warning tones (1000 -fold intensity, level 30 dB higher) to above 1000 m. Since 2003, hundreds of copies have been sold to and used by mainly military forces, in particular of the USA in occupied Iraq, but police, port authorities and border patrol have also ordered the LRAD. In the high-power warning mode the sound in front of the system is at levels dangerous to unprotected hearing. In order to prevent permanent hearing damage, the exposure has to be limited to a few seconds out to 50 m distance. The LRAD has been used to expel snipers and repel pirates. For such use as a weapon, an evaluation under the laws of warfare should be done explicitly. The same holds for human-rights or constitutional law for weapon-like use by internal security forces. To prevent hearing damage, technical devices should be introduced that limit the sound power and/or duration depending on the distance to the target subject(s). The four technologies differ widely. The first three are clearly weapons, one (ADS) potentially lethal, the other two (ATL and PEP) lethal. The LRAD can be used for hailing and warning or in weapon mode. Final judgement whether introduction and use of these technologies is legally or morally justified, will strongly depend on the scenarios. Because all technologies can be problematic, continuous attention of human-rights organisations, the International Committee of the Red Cross etc. is needed. Neue Techniken nicht-tödlicher Waffen (ntW) sind in militärischer Forschung und Entwicklung, vor allem in den USA. Durch unvollständige Information wird die Beurteilung unter Kriterien des Humanitären Völkerrechts oder der Menschenrechte behindert. Diese Studie analysiert vier mögliche ntW-Techniken, die auf physikalischer Grundlage beruhen, um verlässliche Information für eine solche Beurteilung zur Verfügung zu stellen. Das Active Denial System (ADS) erzeugt einen Strahl elektromagnetischer Millimeterwellen; solche Strahlung wird in den obersten 0, 4 mm der Haut absorbiert. Der Strahl bleibt bis zu vielen hundert Meter etwa 2 m breit. Mit einer Leistung von 100 Kilowatt kann der Strahl die Haut von Zielpersonen innerhalb von Sekunden auf Schmerz erzeugende Temperaturen aufheizen. Mit einer Prototypwaffe, eingebaut in ein militärisches Mehrzweckfahrzeug, sind die Wirkungen an Hunderten von Freiwilligen erprobt worden. Damit Schmerz erzeugt wird, aber Verbrennungen vermieden werden, werden die Leistung und die Strahldauer für eine Waffenauslösung durch Software gesteuert. Modellrechnungen zeigen, dass bei der höchsten Leistungsstufe Verbrennungen zweiten und dritten Grades mit vollständiger Hautnekrose nach weniger als 2 Sekunden auftreten werden. Selbst mit einer niedrigeren Leistungsstufe oder Dauer hat der/die Bediener/in die Möglichkeit, sofort erneut auszulösen. Kollateralschaden ist kein großes Problem. Anwendung im bewaffneten Konflikt würde erheblich geringere Verletzung hervorrufen als Flammenwerfer, die als legitime Waffen zählen. Solche Nutzung ist jedoch nicht sehr wahrscheinlich, weil das System groß ist, sich zur Wirkung exponieren muss und gegen viele Arten leichter Waffen verletzlich ist. Wahrscheinlicher ist die Anwendung für innere Sicherheit, durch Besatzungsstreitkräfte gegen Aufstände usw. Wenn man in Rechnung stellt, dass der/die Bediener/in bis zu einem km entfernt sein kann, könnten Überdosierungen mit schweren Verbrennungen unter solchen Umständen nur verhindert werden, wenn ein technisches Gerät zuverlässig die Hauttempera-tur begrenzen würde, d. h. die Strahlleistung oder –dauer in Abhängigkeit von der Zielentfernung begrenzen sowie verhindern würde, dass gegen dieselbe Person noch einmal gestrahlt würde, bevor eine gewisse Abkühlzeit vergangen ist. Der Advanced Tactical Laser (ATL) soll in einem Transportflugzeug montiert werden und einen infraroten Laserstrahl von 300 Kilowatt Leistung aussenden, die aus einer chemischen Reaktion stammt. Über einen 0, 5 m großen Sende- und Richtspiegel kann der Strahl – unter Idealbedingungen – auf einen Fleck von 0, 1 - 0, 2 m Größe über 10 km und mehr fokussiert werden. Mit der 100 -fachen Leistung einer Herdplatte, die auf eine ähnliche Fläche einwirkt, würden in Sekundenbruchteilen Holz oder Textilien in Brand gesetzt werden oder Metall durchschmelzen. Starke Turbulenz begrenzt die Reichweite, Nebel, Staub oder starker Regen kann sie erheblich verringern. Mit Treibstoff für etwa 100 Sekunden Strahlung an Bord und Zielzeiten unter 1 Sekunde wird der Strahl in vielen Fällen automatisch gerichtet und abgefeuert werden. Der ATL kann Gerät zerstören und Menschen töten, er ist keine nicht-tödliche Waffe. Nutzung im bewaffneten Konflikt kann mit Flammenwerfern verglichen werden, die nach dem humanitären Völkerrecht erlaubt sind. Verglichen mit anderen Mitteln, Gewalt über viele Kilometer Entfernung auszuüben (Artillerie, Bomben), würde der ATL viel selektivere Zerstörung erlauben. Der ATL hat Beschränkungen: Der Treibstoff reicht nur für ungefähr 100 „Schüsse“. Eine freie Sichtlinie ist nötig, was die Wirkung durch starken Nebel oder Regen verhindert und das Trägerflugzeug exponiert. Durch seine Größe, lange Reichweite und drastische Wirkung ist der ATL für die Polizei nicht geeignet. In Friedens-erzwingenden Einsätzen könnte er genaueres Treffen erlauben, als das mit Artillerie oder gelenkten Bomben möglich ist, aber dennoch sind bis zu mehreren Meter von einem explodierenden Reifen, Treibstofftank oder von Munition Kollateralschäden möglich. Das Konzept des Pulsed Energy Projectile (PEP) ist es, mit kurzen, starken, infraroten Laserpulsen einen mechanischen Impuls zu erzeugen. Der Laser arbeitet mit einer chemischen Reaktion. Wenn die Pulsintensität hoch genug ist, wird die oberste Schicht des Ziels explosionsartig verdampft und der Dampf bis zu einem Plasma aufgeheizt, das den Rest des Pulses absorbiert und eine Laser-unterstützte Detonationswelle erzeugt. Diese Stoßwelle übt einen mechanischen Impuls auf das Ziel aus. Mit einer Reichweite von 0, 5 - 2 km soll das PEP gegen Menschen und Gerät benutzt werden, im bewaffneten Konflikt sowie in der Rechtsdurchsetzung. Das Verhältnis zwischen Impuls und Laserpuls-Energie ist so, dass bei einer relativ hohen Energie von 1 Kilojoule, die einen großen, schweren Laser erfordert (1 - 2 Meter, hunderte Kilogramm), der mechanische Impuls mit 0, 1 Newton-Sekunde eine oder zwei Größenordnungen unter dem von einem Gummiknüppel oder von Wuchtmunition für stumpfen Aufprall liegt. Viele Pulse in schneller Folge würden sich addieren, aber dann würde das Ziel bis zu entsprechend größerer Tiefe abgetragen, die nach Millimeter misst. Wenn nackte Haut getroffen würde, wären schlimme Wunden die Folge. Zusätzlich kann es dauerhafte Hörschäden schon von der Stoßwelle nur eines Laserpulses geben. Wenn das Auge getroffen wird, sind schwere Verletzungen durch Hornhaut-Abtragung oder mechanischen Impuls wahrscheinlich. In klarer, nicht turbulenter Luft wird der Brennfleck bis zu wenigen Kilometer bei wenigen Zentimeter Größe bleiben, aber dichter Nebel oder Regen wird die Ausbreitung stark begrenzen. Das PEP ist eine tödliche Waffe. Es könnte selektiv genutzt werden, ohne großes Potential für Kollateralschäden. Der Vergleich mit durchdringenden Geschossen oder Flammenwerfern zeigt, dass seine Anwendung im bewaffneten Konflikt nicht von vornherein den Kriegsführungsregeln widersprechen würde. Es sollte jedoch untersucht werden, ob auf nackter Haut, inbesondere im Gesicht, erzeugte schwere Wunden oder der Verlust des Sehver-mögens durch Augenverletzungen als unnötiges Leiden oder überflüssige Verletzung zählen können. Das PEP hat Beschränkungen. Es braucht eine freie Sichtlinie zum Ziel, so dass es exponiert ist, und funktioniert in dichtem Nebel oder Regen nicht, es wird groß, schwer und teuer sein. Durch seine Größe, Reichweite und mögliche Verletzungswirkungen wäre das PEP als Waffe weder für Rechtsdurchsetzung noch für Friedens-erzwingende Einsätze angemessen. Für mechanischen Stoß und Schmerz bieten stumpfe Wuchtgeschosse eine viel leichtere, viel billigere Möglichkeit mit weniger Verletzungsrisiko. Das Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) wurde in einem Waffenprogramm entwickelt, wird aber nun als ein Ruf- und Warngerät bezeichnet. Es ist ein flacher Lautsprecher, der wegen seines Durchmessers von 0, 8 m eine relativ hohe Richtwirkung hat(Strahlöffnungswinkel 5 - 15 &# 1048689;). Es sendet vor allem hohe Frequenzen aus (über 1 Kilohertz); Sprachbotschaften haben eine Reichweite über 500 m, Warntöne (1000 -fache Intensität, Pegel 30 dB höher) bis über 1000 m. Seit 2003 wurden hunderte Exemplare verkauft und von Streitkräften, insbesondere der USA im besetzten Irak, benutzt, aber Polizei, Hafenbehörden und Grenztruppen haben das LRAD ebenfalls bestellt. Im Hochleistungs-Warnmodus hat der Schall vor dem System Pegel, die für das ungeschützte Gehör gefährlich sind. Um dauerhafte Hörschäden zu vermeiden, muss die Einwirkungsdauer in bis zu 50 m Entfernung auf einige Sekunden begrenzt werden. Das LRAD ist verwendet worden, um Scharfschützen zu vertreiben und Piraten abzuwehren. Für solche Nutzung als Waffe sollte eine ausdrückliche Bewertung unter den Kriegsführungsregeln durchgeführt werden. Dasselbe gilt für die Menschenrechte oder das Verfassungsrecht für den Fall waffenartiger Nutzung durch innere Sicherheitskräfte. Um Gehörschäden zu vermeiden, sollte ein technisches Gerät eingeführt werden, das die Schallleistung und/oder –dauer abhängig von der Entfernung zu der Zielperson begrenzt. Die vier Techniken unterscheiden sich stark. Die ersten drei sind klar Waffen, eine (ADS) potentiell tödlich, die anderen beiden (ATL und PEP) tödlich. Das LRAD kann für Rufen und Warnung oder in einem Waffenmodus benutzt werden. Die endgültige Beurteilung, ob Einführung und Nutzung dieser Techniken juristisch oder moralisch gerechtfertigt sind, wird stark von den Szenarien abhängen. Weil alle Techniken problematisch sein können, ist ständige Aufmerksamkeit von Menschenrechtsorganisationen, dem Internationalen Komitee des Roten Kreuzes usw. nötig...|$|E

Water turbines were introduced in the 1840s.Alfred Victor du Pont acquired additional property, down stream from the Eleutherian Mills, {{to add to the}} manufacturing site. One of these properties was called Hagley, and it became known as the Hagley Yard.Most of the industrial remains are located in the Hagley Yard. The mills were used in the purification, crushing, and mixing of charcoal, sulfur, and saltpeter. Other mills in the complex were used for glazing and corning, making metal powder kegs, and in cotton and woolen manufacturing. Stables, offices, a machine shop, and a steam powerhouse from the late 19th century also were located in the complex, as was a narrow gauge railway.|$|R
25|$|Normally, {{steam power}} is {{generated}} by the submarine's nuclear reactor delivering pressurized hot water to the steam generator, which generates steam to drive the steam-driven turbines and generators. While the emergency diesel generator is starting up, <b>power</b> can be <b>provided</b> <b>from</b> the submarine's battery through the ship service motor generators. Likewise, propulsion is normally delivered through the submarine's steam-driven main turbines that drive the submarine's propeller through a reduction gear system. The submarine has no main drive shaft, unlike conventional diesel electric submarines.|$|R

40|$|A stand alone, mobile {{photovoltaic}} {{power system}} along with a cable deployment system was designed and constructed {{to take part in}} the Desert Research And Technology Studies (RATS) lunar surface human interaction evaluation program at Cinder Lake, Arizona. The power system consisted of a photovoltaic array/battery system. It is capable of providing 1 kW of electrical power. The system outputs were 48 V DC, 110 V AC, and 220 V AC. A cable reel with 200 m of power cable was used to <b>provide</b> <b>power</b> <b>from</b> the trailer to a remote location. The cable reel was installed on a small trailer. The reel was <b>powered</b> to <b>provide</b> low to no tension deployment of the cable. The cable was connected to the 220 V AC output of the power system trailer. The power was then converted back to 110 V AC on the cable deployment trailer for use at the remote site. The Scout lunar rover demonstration vehicle was used to tow the cable trailer and deploy the power cable. This deployment was performed under a number of operational scenarios, manned operation, remote operation and tele-robotically. Once deployed, the cable was used to <b>provide</b> <b>power,</b> <b>from</b> the power system trailer, to run various operational tasks at the remote location...|$|R

5|$|Overall {{command of}} the naval force {{was taken by the}} US Seventh Fleet, and the bulk of the naval <b>power</b> <b>{{provided}}</b> was also <b>from</b> the US. The United Kingdom also provided a small naval task force including an aircraft carrier and several cruisers. Eventually, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand provided ships as well. Several hundred fighter-bombers of the Fifth Air Force were positioned within the perimeter and in Japan, and just off the coast were US Navy aircraft aboard the USS Valley Forge and the USS Philippine Sea. By the end of the battle the Eighth Army had more air support than General Omar Bradley's Twelfth United States Army Group in Europe during World War II.|$|R
