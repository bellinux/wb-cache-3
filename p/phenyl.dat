5|$|Based on {{computer}} simulations, {{the distance of}} the divalent carbon atom to its neighbours is claimed to be 138 picometers with a bond angle of 158.8°. The planes of the <b>phenyl</b> groups are almost at right angles to each other (the dihedral angle being 85.7°).|$|E
5|$|It is a {{moderately}} strong Lewis acid, forming adducts with Lewis bases such as triphenylphosphine oxide, e.g. FeCl3(OPPh3)2 where Ph = <b>phenyl.</b> It also reacts with other chloride salts {{to give the}} yellow tetrahedral FeCl4− ion. Salts of FeCl4− in hydrochloric acid can be extracted into diethyl ether.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible inhibitors usually covalently modify an enzyme, and {{inhibition}} {{can therefore}} not be reversed. Irreversible inhibitors often contain reactive functional {{groups such as}} nitrogen mustards, aldehydes, haloalkanes, alkenes, Michael acceptors, <b>phenyl</b> sulfonates, or fluorophosphonates. These electrophilic groups react with amino acid side chains to form covalent adducts. The residues modified are those with side chains containing nucleophiles such as hydroxyl or sulfhydryl groups; these include the amino acids serine (as in DFP, right), cysteine, threonine, or tyrosine.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to their}} {{stability}} and relative ease of preparation, rhodocenium salts are the usual starting material for preparing rhodocene and substituted rhodocenes, {{all of which}} are unstable. The original synthesis used a cyclopentadienyl anion and tris(acetylacetonato)rhodium(III); numerous other approaches have since been reported, including gas-phase redox transmetalation and using half-sandwich precursors. Octaphenylrhodocene (a derivative with eight <b>phenyl</b> groups attached) was the first substituted rhodocene to be isolated at room temperature, though it decomposes rapidly in air. X-ray crystallography confirmed that octaphenylrhodocene has a sandwich structure with a staggered conformation. Unlike cobaltocene, which has become a useful one-electron reducing agent in research, no rhodocene derivative yet discovered is stable enough for such applications.|$|E
25|$|A 2,4-dichloro-substituted <b>phenyl</b> ring at the {{pyrazole}} 1-position {{is preferred}} for affinity {{as well as}} for the activity. It has been shown that additional halogens on this <b>phenyl</b> ring decrease affinity.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} stereochemical {{relationship of}} consecutive <b>phenyl</b> groups determines the tacticity, {{which has an}} effect on various physical properties of the material. The diastereomer where all of the <b>phenyl</b> groups are on the same side is called isotactic polystyrene, which is not produced commercially.|$|E
25|$|Each carbon of the {{backbone}} has tetrahedral geometry, and those carbons {{that have a}} <b>phenyl</b> group (benzene ring) attached are chiral. If {{the backbone}} were to be laid as a flat elongated zig-zag chain, each <b>phenyl</b> group would be tilted forward or backward compared to {{the plane of the}} chain.|$|E
25|$|Mixed ethers or {{unsymmetrical}} ethers; e.g., methyl ethyl ether, methyl <b>phenyl</b> ether, etc.|$|E
25|$|Optimal binding at the CB1 {{receptor}} {{requires a}} para-substituted <b>phenyl</b> ring at the pyrazole 5-position. The 5-substituent of the pyrazole {{is involved in}} receptor recognition and antagonism. The para-substituent of the <b>phenyl</b> ring could be chlorine, bromine or iodine, {{but it has been}} shown that an alkyl chain could also be tolerated. Numbering of the central pyrazole ring is shown in Figure 2.|$|E
25|$|A {{reaction}} modification with an aromatic <b>phenyl</b> ester as a reactant {{is called}} the Fries rearrangement.|$|E
25|$|This {{transition}} state likely {{occurs because}} of favorable pi-stacking with the <b>phenyl</b> substituent. The enantioselectivity {{of the process}} is facilitated from the diene approaching the dienophile from the opposite face of the <b>phenyl</b> substituent. The Diels-Alder reaction {{is one of the}} most powerful transformations in synthetic chemistry. The synthesis of natural products using the Diels-Alder reaction as a transform has been applied especially to the formation of six-membered rings(scheme 18).|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} ethidium bromide's intense {{fluorescence}} after binding with DNA {{is probably not}} due to rigid stabilization of the <b>phenyl</b> , because the <b>phenyl</b> ring {{has been shown to}} project outside the intercalated bases. In fact, the <b>phenyl</b> group is found to be almost perpendicular to the plane of the ring system, as it rotates about its single bond to find a position where it will impinge upon the ring system minimally. Instead, the hydrophobic environment found between the base pairs is believed to be responsible. By moving into this hydrophobic environment and away from the solvent, the ethidium cation is forced to shed any water molecules that were associated with it. As water is a highly efficient fluorescent quencher, the removal of these water molecules allows the ethidium to fluoresce.|$|E
25|$|Boiled {{with carbon}} disulfide, it gives sulfocarbanilide (diphenylthiourea) (CS(NHC6H5)2), {{which may be}} {{decomposed}} into <b>phenyl</b> isothiocyanate (C6H5CNS), and triphenyl guanidine (C6H5N=C(NHC6H5)2).|$|E
25|$|The first {{reported}} Claisen rearrangement is the -sigmatropic rearrangement of an allyl <b>phenyl</b> ether to intermediate 1, which quickly tautomerizes to an ortho-substituted phenol.|$|E
25|$|The <b>phenyl</b> ether {{polymers}} are a {{class of}} aromatic polyethers containing aromatic cycles in their main chain: Polyphenyl ether (PPE) and Poly(p-phenylene oxide) (PPO).|$|E
25|$|Another {{commercial}} semisynthesis (by {{the company}} Natural Pharmaceuticals) {{relies on the}} isolation {{of a group of}} paclitaxel derivatives isolated from primary ornamental taxanes. These derivatives have the same skeleton as paclitaxel except for the organic residue R of the terminal tail amide group which can be <b>phenyl,</b> or propyl or pentyl (among others) whereas in paclitaxel it is an explicit <b>phenyl</b> group. The semisynthesis consists of conversion of the amide group to an amine with Schwartz's reagent through an imine followed by acidic workup and a benzoylation.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{reacts with}} certain di-esters, such as <b>phenyl</b> oxalate ester (cyalume), to produce chemiluminescence; this application is most commonly {{encountered in the}} form of glow sticks.|$|E
25|$|Azobenzene is a {{chemical}} compound {{composed of two}} <b>phenyl</b> rings linked by a N=N double bond. It is the simplest example of an aryl azo compound. The term 'azobenzene' or simply 'azo' {{is often used to}} refer to a wide class of molecules that share the core azobenzene structure, with different chemical functional groups extending from the <b>phenyl</b> rings. These azo compounds are considered as derivatives of diazene (diimide), and are sometimes referred to as 'diazenes'. The diazenes absorb light strongly and are used as dyes in a variety of industries.|$|E
25|$|Hydroboration of 1,2-disubstituted alkenes, {{such as a}} cis or trans olefin, {{produces}} {{generally a}} mixture of the two organoboranes of comparable amounts, even if the substituents are very different in terms of steric bulk. For such 1,2-disubstituted olefins, regioselectivity can be observed only {{when one of the}} two substituents is a <b>phenyl</b> ring. In such cases, such as trans-1-phenylpropene, the boron atom is placed on the carbon adjacent to the <b>phenyl</b> ring. The observations above indicate that the addition of H-B bond to olefins is under electronic control rather than steric control.|$|E
25|$|Lithium {{aluminium}} hydride hydroaluminates alkynes {{to afford}} trans alkenylalanes. In equation (7) hydride {{adds to the}} terminal carbon, which places the developing negative charge next to the stabilizing <b>phenyl</b> substituent.|$|E
25|$|Amiodarone may be {{an acronym}} for its IUPAC name (2-butyl-1-benzofuran-3-yl)-methanone, where ar is a {{placeholder}} for <b>phenyl.</b> This is partially supported by dronedarone which is noniodinated benzofuran derivative of amiodarone, where the arylmethanone is conserved.|$|E
25|$|Diphenyl ether is {{the organic}} {{compound}} with the formula O(C6H5)2. The molecule {{is subject to}} reactions typical of other <b>phenyl</b> rings, including hydroxylation, nitration, halogenation, sulfonation, and Friedel–Crafts alkylation or acylation. This simple diaryl ether enjoys a variety of niche applications.|$|E
25|$|For optimal {{activity}} and selectivity of the coxibs, a 4-methylsulfonylphenyl attached to an unsaturated (usually) five-membered ring with a vicinal lipophilic group is required (rofecoxib). The SO2CH3 {{can be replaced}} by SO2NH2, wherein the lipophilic pocket is occupied by an optionally substituted <b>phenyl</b> ring or a bulky alkoxy substituent (celecoxib). Within the hydrophilic side-pocket of COX-2, the oxygen of the sulfonamide (or sulfone) group interacts with Hist90, Arg513, and Gln192 and forms hydrogen bonds. The substituted <b>phenyl</b> group {{at the top of}} the channel interacts with the side-chains of amino acid residues through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Tyr385 makes for some sterical restrictions of this side of the binding site so a small substituent of the <b>phenyl</b> group makes for better binding. Degrees of freedom are also important for the binding. The central ring of the coxibs decides the orientation of the aromatic rings and, therefore, the binding to COX enzyme even though it often has no electrostatic interactions with any of the amino acid residues. The high lipophilicity of the active site does require low polarity of the central scaffold of the coxibs.|$|E
25|$|The {{method has}} also been applied to the {{synthesis}} of enantiopure benzyl amines in scheme 3, which involves ortho-lithiation of tert-butyl <b>phenyl</b> sulfoxide. On approach to the lithium intermediate, the bulky tosyl group on the imine electrophile {{is responsible for the}} asymmetric induction taking place.|$|E
25|$|A model {{based on}} {{electron}} crystallographic density and {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} deconvolution has been proposed to explain the binding of docetaxel to β-tubulin. In this T-shaped/butterfly model, a deep hydrophobic cleft exists near {{the surface of the}} β-tubulin where three potential hydrogen bonds and multiple hydrophobic contacts bind to docetaxel. The hydrophobic pocket walls contain helices H1, H6, H7 and a loop between H6 and H7 that form hydrophobic interactions with the 3’-benzamido <b>phenyl,</b> 3’-phenyl, and the 2-benzoyl <b>phenyl</b> of docetaxel. 3’-phenyl also has contact with β-sheets B8 and B10. The C-8 methyl of docetaxel has Van der Waals interactions with two residues, Thr-276 and Gln-281 near the C-terminal end of β-tubulin. Docetaxel’s O-21 experiences electrostatic attraction to Thr-276 and the C-12 methyl has proximity with Leu-371 on the loop between B9 and B10.|$|E
25|$|Amygdalin is {{contained}} in stone fruit kernels, such as apricot (8%), peach (6%), bitter almond (5%), and plum (2.5%); amygdalin {{is also found in}} the seeds of the apple. The stones are taken out of the fruit and cracked to obtain the kernels, which are dried in the sun or in ovens. The kernels are boiled in ethanol; on evaporation of the solution and the addition of diethyl ether, amygdalin is precipitated as white minute crystals. Natural amygdalin has the (R)-configuration at the chiral <b>phenyl</b> center. Under mild basic conditions, this stereogenic center isomerizes; the (S)-epimer is called neoamygdalin. Although the synthesized version of amygdalin is the (R)-epimer, the stereogenic center attached to the nitrile and <b>phenyl</b> groups easily epimerizes if the manufacturer does not store the compound correctly.|$|E
25|$|The same {{computation}} with a hydroxonium ion and 6 {{molecules of}} water {{has the same}} result, but, when the migrating substituent is <b>phenyl</b> in the reaction of acetophenone oxime with protonated acetic acid, the mechanism favors {{the formation of an}} intermediate three-membered π-complex. This π-complex is again not found in the H3O+(H2O)6.|$|E
25|$|Phenol, {{also known}} as {{carbolic}} acid, is an aromatic organic compound with the molecular formula C6H5OH. It is a white crystalline solid that is volatile. The molecule consists of a <b>phenyl</b> group (−C6H5) bonded to a hydroxyl group (−OH). It is mildly acidic and requires careful handling due to its propensity to cause chemical burns.|$|E
25|$|Phenyldichloroarsine {{is one of}} four organic arsenicals, {{the other}} three are {{lewisite}} (L), methyldichloroarsine (MD), and ethyldichloroarsine (ED). PD is considered an analog of lewisite. At its freezing point, -20°C, PD becomes a microcrystalline solid mass. The compound has a C-metalloid bond between the <b>phenyl</b> group and the arsenic and two covalent bonds between the arsenic and the chlorine.|$|E
25|$|Photo-aging {{is another}} {{degradation}} route for polycarbonates. Polycarbonate molecules (such as the aromatic ring) absorb UV radiation. This absorbed energy causes cleavage of covalent bonds which initiates the photo-aging process. The reaction can be propagated via side chain oxidation, ring oxidation or photo-fries rearrangement. Products formed include <b>phenyl</b> salicylate, dihydroxybenzophenone groups, and hydroxydiphenyl ether groups.|$|E
25|$|Aniline is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C6H5NH2. Consisting of a <b>phenyl</b> group attached to an amino group, aniline is the prototypical aromatic amine. Its main use {{is in the}} manufacture of precursors to polyurethane and other industrial chemicals. Like most volatile amines, it possesses the odour of rotten fish. It ignites readily, burning with a smoky flame characteristic of aromatic compounds.|$|E
25|$|The main RAFT {{equilibrium}} {{and hence}} the rate retardation of the reaction is influenced by both temperature and chemical factors. A high temperature favors formation of the fragmentation products rather than the adduct radical Pn-S-C•(Z)-S-Pm. RAFT agents with a radical stabilising Z-group such as <b>Phenyl</b> group favor the adduct radical, as do propagating radicals whose monomers lack radical stabilising features, for example Vinyl acetate.|$|E
25|$|Zinc enolates, {{prepared}} from {{alkali metal}} enolates and ZnCl2, provide control of stereochemistry in aldol condensation reactions due to chelation {{on to the}} zinc. In the example shown below, the threo product was favored over the erythro {{by a factor of}} 5:1 when ZnCl2 in DME/ether was used. The chelate is more stable when the bulky <b>phenyl</b> group is pseudo-equatorial rather than pseudo-axial, i.e., threo rather than erythro.|$|E
25|$|The main {{differences}} of the synephrine isomers compared for example to the ephedrines are the hydroxy-substitutions on the benzene ring. Synephrines are direct sympathomimetic drugs while the ephedrines are both {{direct and indirect}} sympathomimetics. One {{of the main reasons}} for these differential effects is the obviously increased polarity of the hydroxy-substituted <b>phenyl</b> ethyl amines which renders them less able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier as illustrated in the examples for tyramine and the amphetamine analogs.|$|E
25|$|The {{coplanar}} {{group members}} {{have a fairly}} rigid structure, with their two <b>phenyl</b> rings in the same plane. It renders their structure similar to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and allows them to act like PCDDs, as an agonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in organisms. They are considered as contributors to overall dioxin toxicity, and the term dioxins and dioxin-like compounds is often used interchangeably when the environmental and toxic impact of these compounds is considered.|$|E
25|$|Related to the Wittig {{reaction}} is the Peterson olefination. This uses a less accessible silicon-based reagent {{in place of}} the phosphorane, but it allows for the selection of E- or Z-products. If an E-product is desired, another alternative is the Julia olefination, which uses the carbanion generated from a <b>phenyl</b> sulfone. The Takai olefination based on an organochromium intermediate also delivers E-products. A titanium compound, Tebbe's reagent, is useful for the synthesis of methylene compounds; in this case, even esters and amides react.|$|E
