50|$|Deciding {{whether or}} not PV is at grid parity {{is more complex than}} other sources, due to a side-effect of one of its main advantages. Compared to most sources, like wind {{turbines}} or hydro dams, PV can scale successfully to systems as small as one panel or as large as millions. In the case of small systems, they can be installed at the customer's location. In this case the LCOE competes against the retail price of grid power, which includes all upstream additions like <b>transmission</b> <b>fees,</b> taxes, etc. In the example above, grid parity has been reached in Nagano. However, retail prices are generally higher than wholesale prices, so grid parity may not have been reached for the very same system installed on the supply-side of the grid.|$|R

For instance, the renewable generation company is willing to sell its excessive generated power to the PtG plants at half of the market clearing price (MCP). It {{should be noted that}} C [...] E [...] is normally higher than MCP, as it also contains <b>transmission</b> <b>fees</b> and tariffs. As a result, the actual price that the PtG plants pay for the electricity will be reduced by half of the MCP per MWh. In this way, the cost of PtG plants will be compensated. Considering the costs of PtG plants at present and the estimated costs in 2020, this approach will reduce the losses of the PtG plants, but is not likely to change their economic inefficiencies completely.|$|R

It is shown how such a concept is made readily available for students and schools by using regular mobile phones and computers they already possess. We describe an example implementation, along with pedagogical guidelines for usage, and the analysis of how the prototype was received in an authentic setting. Students generally found the prototype easy to use and thought it contributed to increased learning outcome.

50|$|At {{the same}} time, Bulgaria has a rapidly {{expanding}} renewable energy market. Growth in the sector has surpassed forecasts and has notably increased prices and {{strain on the}} electrical grid {{in the past few}} years. Investment in wind and solar power installations between 2008 and 2012 in Bulgaria is estimated at more than 4 billion euros, which needs to be repaid by surcharges on electricity prices over the next years. Since 2005, electricity prices for industrial consumers, along with other utilities, have doubled or tripled. In 2011, SCEWR rejected demands by regional monopolies to increase power prices, but a string of severe price spikes occurred in 2012 as a consequence of renewable energy charges. In response, the government drastically cut preferential feed-in tariffs for solar power with 50%, and with 22% for wind power. SCEWR also increased power <b>transmission</b> <b>fees</b> by 50 per cent in an attempt to curb green energy production. These measures led to a drop in electricity exports and withdrawal of investment projects, but prices continued to rise slowly in the following months. Subsequent inflation caused by higher production costs was recorded as the highest for the past four years.|$|R
40|$|A {{cooperative}} game theoretic {{framework is}} introduced {{to study the}} behavior of cooperating and competing electrical energy providers considering price-preference rational consumers. We analyze the interactions of generators in an idealized environment described by a DC load flow model where the network is lossless and is operated by an independent regulator who ensures network stability and fulfillment of consumption needs while {{taking into account the}} preferences of consumers over generators. We assume an iterative process in which the generators publish their price offers simultaneously in each step, based on which the consumers preferences are determined. The model deals with network congestion and safety as not every generator-consumer matching is allowed to ensure the fault tolerant operation of the transmission system. To make the model as simple as possible we do not deal with <b>transmission</b> <b>fees,</b> the profit of the generators is determined as the difference between their income, and their production cost which is assumed to be linearly decreasing with the produced quantity. Any non-monopolistic proper subset of the generators may cooperate and harmonize their offered prices to increase their resulting profit. Since we allow the redistribution of profits among cooperating generators, a transferable utility game theoretic framework is used. Furthermore, as cooperation affects the outsiders as well, the resulting game is defined in partition function form. The model is able to demonstrate some interesting benefits of cooperation as well as the effect of market regulations and asymmetric information on the resulting profits and total social cost...|$|R

I develop a simple model that allows to decompose it in {{the sum of the}} risk-free rate and a risk premium. There are two general principles with vhich the rate should conform: (a) it should vary pari passu with the risk-free rate (b) it should compensate the transmission company for: (i) the “risk of regulatory opportunism”; (ii) the nondiversifiable risk imposed to the transmission company by the price-fixing rule; (iii) and also add a liquidity premium. Legislation presently discussed in congress, however, would grant a fixed 10 % real rate to the transmission company. Approximating the risk-free rate by the rate paid by a 20 -year b ond issued by the Central Bank (PRC) I use the model to estimate the level of risk that justifies a rate of exactly 10 %. Finally, I propose a method to regulate <b>transmission</b> <b>fees</b> that would eliminate most revenue risk and would avoid a need to fix a regulated rate.

40|$|Riksbyggen Fastighetsservice is {{a company}} whose {{businesses}} cope with building construction and related services. The local office of Riksbyggen Fastighetsservice in Gävle has been studied in this project. The local office locates in Näringen 20 : 4, which was constructed in 1989.   The aim of this project {{is to make a}} diagnosis of the current situation; find out the most applicable way of optimizing the operation of the facility {{in order to reduce the}} energy consumption, to study costs and possible savings and provide assistance with future energy management.       Firstly, a study of Energy Balance was conducted. The transmission losses was 57761 KWh; mechanical ventilation losses 3855 KWh; hot tap water heat losses 9579 KWh; natural transmission and infiltration 6897 KWh. On the other hand, heat gain from internal heat was 12707 KWh; solar radiation 8521 KWh; and supply heat 56806 KWh.   Secondly, the energy costs have been checked out. 29655 KWh of electricity was consumed in 2008. 5948 KWh was used by 20 fuses electricity and 23707 KWh was for 25 fuses. Lighting, electrical equipment and machine composed the electricity consumption. Lighting consumes 13278 KWh; equipment consumes 6452 KWh; and machine consumes 9925 KWh. Lighting electricity was composed by office lighting and workshop lighting with 4798 KWh and 8480 KWh respectively.   Electricity cost is very complicated and flexible in Sweden according to effect and consumption. The total cost of electricity consists of electricity commerce <b>fee</b> and electricity <b>transmission</b> net. Electricity commerce fee includes annual fixed fee, electricity fee, energy certificate and tax. Electricity <b>transmission</b> <b>fee</b> includes annual fixed <b>transmission</b> <b>fee,</b> grid fee and tax. Tax plays vital important role which results in huge total cost. The local office spent 43356 kr on electricity in 2008. 4798 kr was spent on office lighting, and 8480 kr was spent on workshop lighting.   On the other hand district heating fee is composed by annual fixed fee, effect fee, energy fee and tax. The local office spent 37142 kr on 56. 806 MWh of district heating in 2008. Thus, the local office purchased 86461 KWh of energies and spent 80498 kr in total in 2008.   Thirdly, to assist its energy traces and management, three tables were designed. One table is for annual energy consumption and cost in each month with all information of sub-terms on costs. One table is for annual electricity consumption for each electrical equipment and cost in accordance. Another table is for district heating consumption and cost.     At last, energy saving possibilities was explored. One way is applying improvements or maintenance of the office construction. The result of Energy Balance shows that transmission losses were 57761 KWh which occupies 74 % of the total losses, and it is the biggest bite. As the office was constructed in 1989, if improvements and maintenance can be applied to the insulation of floor, roof and walls, or change the windows, the heat losses can be reduced.   However, the other solution might be much more applicable and financial sound. Just go to Clas Ohlson to buy LED 1 W and 3 W lamps to replace the current bulbs. Spending 3009 kr to buy 51 LED incandescent bulbs of 1 W effect, and 3576 kr on 24 LED fluorescent of 3 W effect, will save 12057 kr every year. The lighting electricity consumption will be reduced from 13278 KWh / year to 264 KWh / year. Instead of spending 16017 kr on lighting, 98 % will be reduced, and only 318 kr will be paid. Moreover, the payback is really nice, only 0. 42 year. Action! The sooner the better! 20 % of energy cost will be saved...|$|R
40|$|Information {{exchange}} {{is a necessary}} prerequisite for economic exchange over space. This relationship implies that information exchange data corresponds {{to the location of}} economic activity and therefore also of population. Build-ing on this relationship we use postal data to analyse the spatial structure of the population distribution in the German Empire of 1871. In particular we utilize local volume data of a number of <b>postal</b> information <b>transmission</b> ser-vices and a New Economic Geography model to create two index measures, Information Intensity and Amenity. These variables respectively influence the two mechanisms behind the urban population distribution, namely ag-glomeration forces and location endowments. By testing the influence of actual location characteristics on these indices we identify which location factors mattered for the population distribution and show that a number of characteristics worked through both mechanisms. The model is then used to determine counterfactual population distributions, which demonstrate the relative importance of particular factors, most notably the railroad whose re-moval shows a 34 % lower urban population. A data set of large locations for the years 1877 to 1895 shows that market access increases drove the magni-tude of the increase in urban population, while endowment changes shaped their relative pattern.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} long-term planning of power generation and transmission facilities in a deregulated power market. Three models with increasing complexities are developed, primarily for investment decisions in generation and transmission capacity. The models {{are presented in}} a two-stage decision context where generation and transmission capacity expansion decisions {{are made in the}} first stage, while power generation and <b>transmission</b> service <b>fees</b> are decided in the second stage. Uncertainties that exist in the second stage affect the capacity expansion decisions in the first stage. The first model assumes that the electric power market is not constrained by transmission capacity limit. The second model, which includes transmission constraints, considers the interactions between generation firms and the transmission network operator. The third model assumes that the generation and transmission sectors make capacity investment decisions separately. These models result in Nash-Cournot equilibrium among the unregulated generation firms, while the regulated transmission network operator supports the competition among generation firms. Several issues in the deregulated electric power market can be studied with these models such as market powers of generation firms and transmission network operator, uncertainties of the future market, and interactions between the generation and transmission sectors. Results deduced from the developed models include (a) regulated transmission network operator will not reserve transmission capacity to gain extra profits; instead, it will make capacity expansion decisions to support the competition in the generation sector; (b) generation firms will provide more power supplies when there is more demand; (c) in the presence of future uncertainties, the generation firms will add more generation capacity if the demand in the future power market is expected to be higher; and (d) the transmission capacity invested by the transmission network operator depends on the characteristic of the power market and the topology of the transmission network. Also, the second model, which considers interactions between generation and transmission sectors, yields higher social welfare in the electric power market, than the third model where generation firms and transmission network operator make investment decisions separately...|$|R
