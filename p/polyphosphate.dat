5|$|Some {{bacteria}} produce intracellular nutrient storage granules {{for later}} use, such as glycogen, <b>polyphosphate,</b> sulfur or polyhydroxyalkanoates. Certain bacterial species, {{such as the}} photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, produce internal gas vacuoles, vesicles which they use to regulate their buoyancy—allowing them to move up or down into water layers with different light intensities and nutrient levels. The gas vacuoles are freely permeable to gas. Intracellular membranes called chromatophores are also found in membranes of phototrophic bacteria. Used primarily for photosynthesis, they contain bacteriochlorophyll pigments and carotenoids. An early idea was that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artefacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy. Inclusions {{are considered to be}} nonliving components of the cell that do not possess metabolic activity and are not bounded by membranes. The most common inclusions are glycogen, lipid droplets, crystals, and pigments. Volutin granules are cytoplasmic inclusions of complexed inorganic <b>polyphosphate.</b> These granules are called metachromatic granules due to their displaying the metachromatic effect; they appear red or blue when stained with the blue dyes methylene blue or toluidine blue.Microcompartments are widespread, membrane-bound organelles that are made of a protein shell that surrounds and encloses various enzymes. Carboxysomes are bacterial microcompartments that contain enzymes involved in carbon fixation. Magnetosomes are bacterial microcompartments, present in magnetotactic bacteria, that contain magnetic crystals.|$|E

In vivo 31 P NMR studies, {{carried out in the}} unicellular alga, Dunaliella salina, demonstrate that cytoplasmic alkalization induces massive hydrolysis of <b>polyphosphates,</b> which is correlated kinetically with the recovery of cytoplasmic pH.

Mg++ and the natural competitive chelators, pyoverdine and bacteriological peptone, reversed the inhibition. Chilling chicken carcasses overnight in slush ice containing 3 and 8 % <b>polyphosphates</b> lengthened subsequent shelf-life 17 and 25 %, respectively.

50|$|In vivo, factor XII is {{activated}} by contact to polyanions. Activated platelets secrete inorganic polymers, <b>polyphosphates.</b> Contact to <b>polyphosphates</b> activates factor XII and initiates fibrin formation by the intrinsic pathway of coagulation with critical importance for thrombus formation.

Addition of <b>polyphosphates</b> restored defective plasma clotting of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome patients, {{indicating that the}} inorganic polymer is the endogenous factor XII activator in vivo. Platelet polyphosphate-driven factor XII activation provides the link from primary hemostasis (formation of a platelet plug) to secondary hemostasis (fibrin meshwork formation).|$|R

40|$|The purinergic {{receptor}} system {{plays an}} important role in the regulation of both vascular and tubular functions within the kidney; however, the release of purinergic agonists other than ATP by renal tissue is not known. In this investigation, we determine if kidney tissue is a source of diadenosine <b>polyphosphates,</b> which have high affinity for the P 2 X and P 2 Y receptors. Both diadenosine pentaphosphate and hexaphosphate were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–mass spectrometry in extracts purified from both whole porcine kidney and from cloned cells of the LLC-PK 1 cell line. Both <b>polyphosphates</b> in nanomolar concentrations were found to significantly stimulate the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells derived from rat thoracic aortas. The purinergic-receptor antagonist, suramin, did not significantly affect the growth-stimulatory properties of the <b>polyphosphates.</b> The growth stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells by platelet-derived growth factor was potentiated by both diadenosine <b>polyphosphates.</b> We conclude that diadenosine <b>polyphosphates</b> are endogenous purinergic agonists of the kidney that have physiologic and pathophysiologic relevance. These epithelial cell metabolic products have vasoregulatory properties while linking the energy supply and tubular function...|$|R
50|$|PPX was {{discovered}} by the lab of Nobel laureate Arthur Kornberg in 1993 and {{is part of the}} <b>polyphosphate</b> operon along with <b>polyphosphate</b> kinase, the enzyme which synthesizes <b>polyphosphate.</b> The Kornberg lab was very interested in <b>polyphosphate</b> and published a series of papers elucidating the metabolism and roles of <b>polyphosphate</b> in vivo.

The results of these studies of <b>polyphosphate</b> by the Kornberg lab led Kornberg to speculate that due to its high energy and phosphate content {{and the degree to which}} it is conserved across species, <b>polyphosphate</b> may have been the precursor to RNA, DNA, and proteins.|$|E

40|$|Inositol <b>polyphosphates</b> {{other than}} Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 are {{involved}} in several aspects of cell regulation. For example, recent evidence has implicated InsP 6, Ins(1, 3, 4, 5, 6) P 5 and their close metabolic relatives, which are amongst the more abundant intracellular inositol <b>polyphosphates,</b> in chromatin organization, DNA maintenance, gene transcription, nuclear mRNA transport, membrane trafficking and control of cell proliferation. However, little is known of how the intracellular concentrations of inositol <b>polyphosphates</b> change through the cell cycle. Here we show that the concentrations of several inositol <b>polyphosphates</b> fluctuate in synchrony with the cell cycle in proliferating WRK- 1 cells. InsP 6, Ins(1, 3, 4, 5, 6) P 5 and their metabolic relatives behave similarly: concentrations are high during G 1 -phase, fall to much lower levels during S-phase and rise again late in the cycle. The Ins(1, 2, 3) P 3 concentration shows especially large fluctuations, and PP-InsP 5 fluctuations are also very marked. Remarkably, Ins(1, 2, 3) P 3 turns over fastest during S-phase, when its concentration is lowest. These results establish that several fairly abundant intracellular inositol <b>polyphosphates,</b> for which important biological roles are emerging, display dynamic behaviour that is synchronized with cell-cycle progression...|$|R
40|$|The {{action of}} <b>polyphosphates</b> on meats has been {{examined}} in studies using different meats {{and has been}} compared with other treatments. The results were monito red by recording cooked yield and observing changes in structure by electron microscopy. Four possible characteristics of <b>polyphosphates</b> are considered: pH, sequestering action, ionic strength and as an ATP (adenosine triphosphate) analogue. In the conditions used in these experiments, the pH-buffering effect of <b>polyphosphates</b> is found as the principal characteristic in meat products. Some meats {{were found to be}} more affected by <b>polyphosphates</b> than others and:. hypothesis is developed to explain this. It is proposed that with meats such as pork, which suffer early pH fall post-mortem, there might be a greater association between sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins than with other meats. The association between sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar proteins may be reversed by increasing the pH of the curing brine and this would allow more dispersion of myofibrillar proteins and hence a higher cooked yield. In most or the meats examined no evidence for specific actomysin solubilisation by <b>polyphosphates</b> was found except in heart and some higher pH beef meat...|$|R
