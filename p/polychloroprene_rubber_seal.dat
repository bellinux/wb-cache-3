The physical (cation-pi/pi-pi) interaction between the ionic liquid and the MWCNTs is evidenced by Raman spectroscopy.

40|$|International audienceOwing {{to their}} {{interesting}} mechanical behavior and their diversity, rubberlike materials {{are more and}} more used in the industry. Previous works (Poisson et al.) presented an important experimental investigation on the multiaxial fatigue of <b>polychloroprene</b> <b>rubber,</b> with both proportional and non-proportional combinations of tension and torsion loads (with a large range of loads and three different phase angles: 0 °; 90 °, 180 °). A fatigue criterion, based on the dissipated energy density (DED) was introduced. Comparing this parameter to the most important criteria available on literature—which are the strain energy density (SED), the cracking energy density (CED), and the Eshelby tensor—in their accuracy allows one to predict fatigue life of rubberlike material. All the predictors are computed with an analytical viscoelastic model based on the kinematics of a combined tension and torsion loading applied on a cylinder. This cylinder represents {{the central part of the}} axisymetric dumbbell specimen, and the model was identified with a <b>polychloroprene</b> <b>rubber.</b> It is finally shown that the DED and CED reach more conclusive results, provided the structure, the material, and the loads investigated...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the high}} temperature, high {{pressure}} and high corrosive {{environment of the}} oil and gas drilling downhole, the weatherability of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> material has a great influence on the production safety. In order to study the important degree of every key environmental factor in downhole influencing the <b>sealing</b> performance of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> material, a new device of simulating downhole environment is designed to test the permeability of O-ring. The sample is hydrogenated nitrile O-ring and orthogonal experiment method is used to do nine tests by getting three levels from temperature, pressure and CO 2 volume fraction. Test adopts fuzzy orthogonal method to analyze the main effects and the interaction between two factors, taking tensile strength, diameter variety rate and pH value of indicator as evaluation index. The results show that: the environmental factor influencing the sealing performance of hydrogenated nitrile O-ring from high to low by turns is temperature, pressure and CO 2 volume fraction, while the interaction between temperature and pressure is the most significant. It provides a new way to study the influence of downhole complex environment on the performance of <b>rubber</b> <b>sealing</b> material.

40|$|Part 5 : Aeronautical and Automotive EngineeringInternational audienceThis paper reviews a {{countermeasure}} {{development of}} leakage from coolant seals of head-gaskets in a diesel engine applying the Decomposition Analysis and Resolution Process (DAR). We can find complexity arising from some causes of leakage {{even in a}} simple square-ring <b>rubber</b> <b>seal.</b> The major causes are (1) large displacement around a head-gasket generated by the combustion, (2) seal distortion at a high compression, (3) <b>seal</b> <b>rubber</b> degradation induced by coolant microorganism deterioration, (4) uncontrolled seal production and (5) unsuitable rubber composition. Through our DAR, we can resolve {{the complexity of the}} leakage and can clarify all the cause positions and their relationships.

40|$|The {{preoperative}} opacification of acrylic {{intraocular lenses}} (IOLs) {{was investigated in}} order to determine its cause. Opacified IOLs were examined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), the buffer solutions were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and the <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> used in the bottles in which the IOLs were stored were ashed and tested. The deposit covering the opacified lenses contained a significant amount of zinc, which was absent from fresh IOLs and buffer solution. The source of this was found to be the <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> used to seal the glass bottles in which the IOLs were stored. There were two types of <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> used, red and grey in colour. The buffer solutions in which opacification had occurred was also contaminated with zinc, but this was only noticeable when using the red seals. This contamination was reproduced by boiling red seals in fresh buffer solution for eighty minutes, to simulate autoclaving. It was concluded that zinc from the zinc oxide used as filler in the <b>rubber</b> <b>seals</b> was leaching into the buffer solution and causing the IOLs to become opacified. This was found to be much worse {{in the case of the}} red seals than for the grey ones. However, minute crystals were found on the IOLs stored using the grey ones, which could potentially act as nucleation points for postoperative opacification...|$|R

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the deformation mechanics within porous structures is an important field of study as these materials exist in nature as well as can be manufactured industrially influencing our lives daily. The motivation of the research contained within this manuscript {{was inspired by the}} desire to understand the mechanics of an elastomeric closed–cell porous material. This type of porous material is often used in load–bearing applications such as sport helmet liners and packing material which can be subjected to large deformations at high rates. Additionally, short term transient effects were explored. In order to investigate the deformation mechanics of a closed cell elastomeric foam, a polychloroprene (neoprene) material was chosen as it was available in both rubber form and a foam with relatively consistent cell size. Compression tests were conducted on the <b>polychloroprene</b> <b>rubber</b> at strain rates ranging from 0. 001 /s to 2700 /s which identified that it had a hyper–viscoelastic behaviour with a significant strain rate dependence. A newly developed constitutive model was created to capture the response of the <b>polychloroprene</b> <b>rubber.</b> A coupled finite element model of the polychloroprene foam was created and compared to experimental tests for validation. The model slightly over predicted the stress level response of the experimental tests. The model was used to identify momentum dissipation mechanisms that contributed to the low wave speed measurement of approximately 70 m/s determined from the model. The investigation of wave transit times through use of the model was key to interpreting experimental data. Of the morphological factors investigated, it was determined that wall thickness had the most significant impact on the stress response of the foam. The pore–scale model was useful for visualizing wavepropagation effects and deformation mechanics which was not feasible experimentally...|$|R

30|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work is to compare the influence of silica-coated nano calcium carbonate (SNCC) with uncoated nano calcium carbonate (NCC) as filler on the property enhancement of <b>polychloroprene</b> <b>rubber</b> (CR) composites. The CR nanocomposites containing SNCC exhibit superior curing, mechanical and thermal properties in comparison to NCC-filled CR nanocomposites. The fantastic enrichment in the resulting properties of CR nanocomposites containing SNCC is mainly due to better rubber–filler interaction resulting from the reasonably excellent dispersion of SNCC within the CR matrix. The more uniform distribution of SNCC in comparison to NCC within the rubber matrix is also confirmed from morphological analysis. Thus, in this article, we report SNCC as {{a new type of}} efficient filler to reinforce the ultimate properties of CR nanocomposites for the first time.|$|R
