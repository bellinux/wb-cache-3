40|$|Abstract. In {{the data}} mining field, data {{representation}} {{turns out to}} be one of the major factors affecting mining algorithm scalability. Mining Frequent Itemsets (MFI) is a data mining problem that is heavily affected by this fact. The vertical approach is one of the successful data representations adopted for MFI problem. The main advantage of this approach is support for fast frequency counting via join-ing operations. Recently, an encoding method called prime-encoding is proposed as an enhancement for the vertical approach [10]. The performance study introduced in [10] confirmed the high quality of prime-encoding based vertical mining of fre-quent sequence over other vertical and horizontal ones in terms of space and time. Though sequence mining is more general than itemset mining, this paper presents a prime-encoding based vertical mining of frequent itemsets with new optimizations and a new re-encoding method that further enhance memory and speed. The exper-imental results show that <b>prime</b> encoding based <b>vertical</b> itemset mining is suitable for high-dimensional sparse data...|$|R
40|$|Part 3 : Extended AbstractsInternational audienceGrowth of Internet {{has led to}} {{exponential}} rise in {{data communication}} over the World Wide Web. Several applications and entities such as online banking transactions, stock trading, e-commerce Web sites, etc. are at a constant risk of eavesdropping and hacking. Hence, security of data is of <b>prime</b> concern. Recently, <b>vertical</b> data have gained lot of focus because of their significant performance benefits over horizontal data in various data mining applications. In our current work, we propose a Predicate-Tree based solution for protection of data. Predicate-Trees or pTrees are compressed, data-mining-ready, vertical data structures and {{have been used in}} a plethora of data-mining research areas such as spatial association rule mining, text clustering, closed k-nearest neighbor classification, etc. We show how for data mining purposes, the scrambled pTrees would be unrevealing of the raw data to anyone except for the authorized person issuing a data mining request. In addition, we propose several techniques which come along as a benefit of using vertical pTrees. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is novel and provides sufficient speed and protection level for an effective data security...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{liquefaction}} {{has been}} extensively investigated over the years with the aim to understand its fundamental mechanism and successfully remediate it. Despite the multi-directional nature of earthquakes, the vertical seismic component is largely neglected, as it is traditionally considered to be of much lower amplitude than the components in the horizontal plane. The 2010 – 2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence in New Zealand is a <b>prime</b> example that <b>vertical</b> accelerations can be of significant magnitude, with peak amplitudes well exceeding their horizontal counterparts. As research on this topic is very limited, there is an emerging need for a more thorough investigation of the vertical motion {{and its effect on}} soil liquefaction. As such, throughout this study, uni- and bidirectional finite-element analyses are carried out focusing on the influence of the input vertical motion on sand liquefaction. The effects of the frequency content of the input motion, of the depth of the deposit and of the hydraulic regime, using variable permeability, are investigated and exhaustively discussed. The results indicate that the usual assumption of linear elastic response when compressional waves propagate in a fully saturated sand deposit does not always hold true. Most importantly post-liquefaction settlements appear to be increased when the vertical component is included in the analysis...|$|R
40|$|We develop {{geometric}} {{techniques to}} determine the spectrum and the chiral indices of matter multiplets for four-dimensional F-theory compactifications on elliptic Calabi-Yau fourfolds with rank two Mordell-Weil group. The general elliptic fiber is the Calabi-Yau onefold in dP 2. We classify its resolved elliptic fibrations over a general base B. The study of singularities of these fibrations leads to explicit matter representations, that we determine both for U(1) × U(1) and SU(5) × U(1) × U(1) constructions. We determine {{for the first time}} certain matter curves and surfaces using techniques involving <b>prime</b> ideals. The <b>vertical</b> cohomology ring of these fourfolds is calculated for both cases and general formulas for the Euler numbers are derived. Explicit calculations are presented for a specific base B = ℙ 3. We determine the general G 4 -flux that belongs to H_V^(2, 2) of the resolved Calabi-Yau fourfolds. As a by-product, we derive for the first time all conditions on G 4 -flux in general F-theory compactifications with a non-holomorphic zero section. These conditions have to be formulated after a circle reduction in terms of Chern-Simons terms on the 3 D Coulomb branch and invoke M-theory/F-theory duality. New Chern-Simons terms are generated by Kaluza-Klein states of the circle compactification. We explicitly perform the relevant field theory computations, that yield non-vanishing results precisely for fourfolds with a non-holomorphic zero section. Taking into account the new Chern-Simons terms, all 4 D matter chiralities are determined via 3 D M-theory/F-theory duality. We independently check these chiralities using the subset of matter surfaces we determined. The presented techniques are general and do not rely on toric data...|$|R

50|$|Three {{antagonistic}} {{pairs of}} muscles control eye movements: the lateral and medial rectus muscles, the superior and inferior rectus muscles, and the superior and inferior oblique muscles. These muscles {{are responsible for}} movements of the eye along three different axes: horizontal, either toward the nose (adduction) or away from the nose (abduction); vertical, either elevation or depression; and torsional, movements that bring {{the top of the}} eye toward the nose (intorsion) or away from the nose (extorsion). Horizontal movements are controlled entirely by the medial and lateral rectus muscles; the medial rectus muscle is responsible for adduction, the lateral rectus muscle for abduction. Vertical movements require the coordinated action of the superior and inferior rectus muscles, as well as the oblique muscles. The relative contribution of the rectus and oblique groups depends on the horizontal position of the eye. In the primary position (eyes straight ahead), both of these groups contribute to vertical movements. Elevation is due to the action of the superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles, while depression is due to the action of the inferior rectus and superior oblique muscles. When the eye is abducted, the rectus muscles are the <b>prime</b> <b>vertical</b> movers. Elevation is due to the action of the superior rectus, and depression is due to the action of the inferior rectus. When the eye is adducted, the oblique muscles are the <b>prime</b> <b>vertical</b> movers. Elevation is due to the action of the inferior oblique muscle, while depression is due to the action of the superior oblique muscle. The oblique muscles are also primarily responsible for torsional movements.|$|E

40|$|At {{the end of}} the 18 th {{century and}} at the {{beginning}} of the 19 th century, observatory buildings underwent a change, because astronomical tools of observation had transformed from light portable equipment into permanently mounted accurate instruments. For positional astronomy, observations were mainly carried out in the meridian or in the <b>prime</b> <b>vertical.</b> A new type of telescope, the equatorially mounted refractor was adopted for the observation of objects such as planets, comets and double stars. The new instruments and methods of observation also required new approaches to observatory design. The new research needs began to determine the exterior, structure and functions of the observatory building. At the beginning of the 19 th century, new standards of observatory planning were developed for the construction of the new observatories of Tartu, Helsinki and Pulkovo. Over many decades, the adopted design principles guided the construction and architecture of avant-garde observatories around the world. They also provided for the archetype of the observatory as a universal emblem for science well into the 20 th century. The article discusses the development stages of these design principles and their global impacts...|$|E
