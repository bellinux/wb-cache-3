5000|$|Snowboards and skiboards have {{generally}} {{had much more}} sidecut than alpine skis, roughly similar in layout to a <b>parabolic</b> <b>ski.</b> These designs evolved independently and were engineered from the start to select a design that produced smooth turns. Alpine skiing had previously been based on a skidding style of turns known as [...] "stemming" [...] that did not require much (or any) sidecut, and did not experiment with other designs as styles changed. Snowboards had to invent their equipment and techniques fresh, and found the deep sidecut was best through experimentation.|$|E
50|$|Alpine skis have {{undergone}} three distinct changes in sidecut design. The earliest skis from the 1800s {{all the way}} to modern examples in the late 1990s featured a very small amount of sidecut that produced a ski that was almost rectangular in profile as seen from the top. Starting with the Elan SCX in 1995, and very rapidly thereafter, these designs dramatically increased sidecut, a design known as the <b>parabolic</b> <b>ski,</b> or later known as a shaped ski. Shaped skis ruled the hills from about 1997 to 2010, when the rocker ski design of much greater width began to appear in force. From about 2012 on the rocker design dominated ski design, with shaped skis being found primarily in beginner equipment.|$|E

5000|$|Elan is a Slovenian company, {{located in}} Begunje, notable in ski {{manufacturing}} for inventing shaped <b>skis,</b> also called <b>parabolic</b> <b>skis</b> that made carve turns possible at low speeds and with short turn radius.|$|R

50|$|By 1994 {{a number}} of smaller {{companies}} had introduced <b>parabolic</b> <b>skis</b> of their own, including the Atomic S-Ski and similar Kneissl Ergo (which developed from Olin's earlier models). Fischer joined the fray with the 15 mm sidecut Ice {{and there was a}} similar model from Head, the Cyber 24. The large conglomerates, Salomon, Rossignol and K2, continued to ignore it.|$|R
5000|$|Shaped <b>skis,</b> {{also called}} <b>parabolic</b> <b>skis,</b> make carve turns {{possible}} at low speeds and with short turn radius. They were first developed in 1988 by Jurij Franko at the Slovenian ski company, Elan. With his colleague Pavel Skofic they organized a project dubbed SideCut Extreme {{and set out}} to build prototypes. The experiment proved immediately successful and the Elan factory ski team began winning almost every race they entered. In the US, ski instructors found that students could easily make parallel turns that would otherwise take considerable practice and training. The company put the ski on the market in 1993 as the Elan SCX.|$|R
5000|$|To {{cope with}} skiing the steep terrain (greater than 50 degrees), Vallen√ßant {{developed}} a new turning technique, known as the [...] "Pedal-Jump Turn" [...] (also [...] "Pedal Hop Turn" [...] and [...] "Pedal Step Turn"). The technique involved pushing off from the uphill ski, away from the slope and completing a portion of turn's rotation while {{in the air and}} then landing back on the downhill ski. With the advent of <b>parabolic</b> <b>skis,</b> using the uphill ski to initiate a turn is now a common technique for carved turns and racing. The key difference is in carving or racing the skier is traveling much faster, the terrain is not as steep and {{there is no need for}} such a dramatic thrust off the slope. The [...] "Pedal-Jump Turn" [...] was originally developed on traditional racing skis.|$|R
5000|$|From Deuce Snowboards and anecdotal {{accounts}} of the SwingBo, the DES is predominantly about offering the [...] "grip" [...] that the classic snowboard lacks. This is audibly known by skiers as the scraping noise {{that is associated with}} snowboarders. This improved grip is also described as better control, which improves carve technique (shredding) and reduces stopping distance. Deuce Snowboards claims that the better carve is not only due to the additional edge, but also {{to the fact that the}} mechanism attaches to the longitudinal center, thus fully and uniformly flexing the boards similar to the design intent of <b>parabolic</b> <b>skis.</b> Plus, since the classic snowboard has a nonuniform flex, mainly characterized as insignificant flex between the riders feet, then the DES has more than twice as much edge control. Other advantages are also defined: seamless edge-to-edge transition, smoother ride, no toe/heel drag, better tip/tip flex and less chance of catching the leading edge.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the behavior of the skis on snow depending on sex, type of ski and the level of training of the technical skier. Material: in the research participated 57 skiers, generally of age 26 +- 8. 62 years (34 males and 23 females) at the ski center of Parnassos (Greece). The evaluation of the ski behavior on snow came up via the scores on Test 1 to Test 5 in practice, to the rating scale from 0 to 10 respectively. The participants, after performing daily training with their skis completed the questionnaire. The questionnaire included the following elements: sex, height, weight, the type of skis and the type of TEST as: 1 - 2) behavior of skis in long and short turning radius, respectively, 3) grip of the ski edges in turn, 4) stability of ski riding, 5) usage of general muscle strength (fatigue). Results: The correlation between the first four tests (Test 1 - 4) was significant at statistical significance level, apart from test 5, which shows reduced physical fitness of the skier. Also the majority of skiers prefer <b>parabolic</b> <b>skis</b> (carving ski), although the racing skis were highly rated. Conclusions: The widespread (carving skis) are skis with medium score in both of all five tests in comparison to the Race ski. Finally, as expected, the highest score was given by the athletes (r = 0. 69 - 0. 99). It is recommended for further research of the correct selection of the ski in relation to: the physical fitness of the skier, prevention and injuries...|$|R
50|$|In 1977 McCluggage {{authored}} {{the book}} The Centered Skier, published by Vermont Crossroads Press owned by Constance Cappel and R. A. Montgomery. It mixed elements of sports psychology and Zen Buddhism highlighted by calligraphy by Al Huang. It became {{the foundation of}} approaches taken {{by the likes of}} the Sugarbush Ski School. On the Professional Ski Instructors of America reading list, the book had a resurgence when <b>parabolic</b> shaped <b>skis</b> were invented in the mid-1990s, putting carved turns, rather than skidded turns, within reach for recreational skiers.|$|R
5000|$|One {{disadvantage}} to the parabolic {{shape is}} that it was much wider at the tip and tail, producing a design with considerable rotational inertia. To offset this effect, the skis had evolved to be much shorter, reducing the moment arm. In spite of the larger [...] "shovels" [...] at the tip and tail, the overall area of the ski was reduced, which led to them tending to sink in soft snow. This left powder skiing and off-piste skis among the few markets not being served by <b>parabolic</b> designs. Several <b>skis</b> aimed at the powder market had appeared over the years, including the Volant Chubb and other [...] "fat-boy skis" [...] from the early to mid 1990s.|$|R
