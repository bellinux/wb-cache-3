40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes, for {{the first}} time, the concept of <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>circuit</b> {{realized}} with single-electron transistors (SETs). An SET having nonvolatile memory function {{is a key element}} for the programmable SET logic. The writing and erasing operations of the nonvolatile memory function make it possible to tune the phase of Coulomb oscillations. The half-period phase shift induced by the memory function makes the function of SETs complementary to that of the conventional SETs. As a result, SETs having nonvolatile memory function have the functionality of both the conventional (nMOS-like) SETs and the complementary (pMOS-like) SETs. By utilizing this fact, the function of SET circuits can be programmed with great flexibility, {{on the basis of the}} information stored by the memory functions. We have successfully fabricated SETs that operate at room temperature and observed the highest room-temperature peak-to-valley current ratio of Coulomb oscillations. The operation of the programmable SET logic is demonstrated using the room-temperature operating SETs. This is the first demonstration of room-temperature SET logic operation. The proposed programmable SET logic provides the potential for low-power, intelligent LSI chips suitable for mobile applications.

40|$|Reduction of RF {{emissions}} is very {{crucial for}} better EMI performance in electrical equipment, for instance installed in automobiles. In this thesis, a flexible curve shaping module for a dcto- dc PWM converter is developed to achieve efficient reduction of RF emission. The {{design of the}} curve shaping module employs a <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>circuit</b> (CPLD) where a lookup table is stored with a certain reference curve shape. A D/A converter converts the digital signal from the CPLD to analogue signal which is then fed to power stage to reproduce the reference curve shape on the output. This output signal can be fed to electrical load. The aim with the module is to employ different lookup tables corresponding to different curve shapes resulting in flexibility of the circuit. Frequency response for different curve shapes i. e. trapezoidal, sinusoidal and low pass filter response were studied in theory for comparing their EMI performance. These curves are also implemented in the real circuit for checking the response from the power stage. By evaluating the practical circuit, it was found out that RF emissions were lowered compared to hard switching techniques.

Revolutionary {{developments in the}} electronics industry have enabled rapid and unprecedented advances in modern systems. This has been achieved {{in part due to}} an aggressive push towards technological developments by the semiconductor industry. The electronics technology has sustained this steep trend, however, the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) that assesses future technology requirements, has identified several fundamental challenges of scalability, speed, energy and reliability that can severely limit the ability of CMOS devices to continue to maintain the sharp developmental curve. These challenges, and the discovery of new physics effects and materials, have ushered in several efforts dedicated to researching new technologies that can help support the aggressive technological roadmap. The emerging technologies bring novel capabilities for computing, however, there are large gaps in our understanding of these new technologies and how to build circuits with them, that must be filled before they can be integrated into computing systems. This thesis focuses on evaluating the computing potential of two promising, emerging technologies: Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and Spintronics. Both technologies differ in their device physics and capabilities from electronic MOSFET devices, and pose novel challenges for integration into current computing systems. The devices from the NEMS technology are extremely power-effcient, however they have a high mechanical delay. To allow the NEMS devices to serve as effective digital switches, a novel logic design technique called `weighted area logic' that addresses the fundamental delay challenge of the devices has been proposed. The new design technique also reduces power and area of implementation by reducing the number of devices in a circuit. Devices from the Spintronics technology are based on magnetic effects and do not directly replace the switch-based electronic transistors. Their singular characteristics necessitate novel ideas to enable logic operations. Some of the differences of the devices from CMOS devices affect fundamental abilities that computing circuits are generally founded on. These include input-output signal compatibility, scalability of logic circuits and composability. Circuit designs and techniques that address these three challenges are proposed and studied using the spintronic devices of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs). A novel MTJ-based logic circuit that operates completely on spintronic principles and has spintronic input-output compatibility is designed and evaluated. An extension of this circuit into a scalable and <b>programmable</b> <b>logic</b> <b>circuit</b> is also proposed.

Prior to this work it was commonly believed that optimization after mapping was infeasible. The advantages of this approach include the ability to optimize a design without having the VHDL source code, the opportunity to selectively optimize only parts of a circuit and {{the preservation of the}} original the state encoding. The optimizations are also transparent to the synthesis process. This is a powerful and versatile method, which gives the designer considerable freedom in optimizing parts of the design according to his or her preferences. The optimization process proceeds as follows. The behavioral or structural description of the design is first written in VHDL. The design is then synthesized using the Workview Office synthesis tool and extracted to an EDIF (Electronic Design Interface Format) mapped netlist targeting Xilinx's Virtex family of FPGAs. This netlist is then analyzed, and an internal representation of the given circuit is created. Any pipelines (blocks of combinational logic feeding one or more registers) that exist in the circuit are then identified and common blocks of logic that reside between the pipeline registers are extracted. Multilevel minimization algorithms in the SIS framework are applied in order to optimize the design.
