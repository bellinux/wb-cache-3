Her current research focuses on normative questions in political philosophy concerning democracy and citizen participation, global governance, human rights, religion and politics. She works in a framework of deliberative democratic theory, where she defends a participatory construal of the democratic ideal against proposals to insulate political decision making from the influence of the citizenry. This conception requires the citizens to respect the priority of public reason over religious or otherwise comprehensive views in their political deliberations in the public sphere. At the level of global governance, she argues against the current state-centric understanding of human rights obligations because of the protection gaps it leaves open. Instead, she advocates a more ambitious construal of the responsibility to protect (R2P) human rights, which she interprets as a <b>provisional</b> <b>duty</b> of the international community as a whole until appropriate institutions are in place to close these gaps. Lafont is also widely known for her work in Critical Theory, especially for her critical elaboration of themes in the philosophy of Jürgen Habermas. Cristina Lafont’s earlier philosophical work in the philosophy of language of Heidegger’s hermeneutics issues in her identification of a specific form of “linguistic turn” (centered on the “world-disclosing” function of conceptual structures in language) in post-Kantian German philosophy between Hamann and Habermas. The upshot is that the systematic idealistic and constructivist tendency of this tradition is owed to a specific set of assumptions in its linguistic philosophy. In this work, she applies select tools from the theory of meaning developed in analytic philosophy of language [...] to foundational issues from German Continental philosophy. This approach enables fruitful and precise comparisons between, e.g., Robert Brandom’s inferentialist framework and hermeneutics or Habermas’ theory of communicative action. One central tenet of Lafont’s philosophical work that runs throughout these otherwise very different works is her interest in the necessary conditions for normative rational criticism and reasoned change on this basis. This motivates her insistence on the need for realist correctives of the idealism characteristic of German philosophy of language {{as much as it is}} behind her critical examination of principles of public reason in deliberative democracy and as it drives her research in human rights (as not merely constructed by but a source of the moral quality of legal and political systems).|$|E
40|$|Several {{scholars}} {{claim that}} Kant’s ethical and political theories are inconsistent. These “inconsistencies” become apparent when scholars attempt to apply Kant’s ethical and political framework to problems in international relations, such as humanitarian intervention (HI). Kok-Chor Tan argues that HI is an imperfect duty of benevolence (ethics), for example, while Carla Bagnoli argues that HI a perfect duty of right (justice). I argue {{the parties in}} this debate are misguided, though much of the disagreement is owing to a failure on Kant’s part to provide a robust conception of justice {{in the state of}} nature. First, I argue that to make Kant’s account fully consistent, a “provisional” duty must be included in his taxonomy. Next, I argue that HI ought to be considered a <b>provisional</b> <b>duty</b> of justice. I then consider whether HI can be a perfect duty of justice, that is, a duty that all actors are capable of fulfilling. This would require the institutionalization of a duty of HI. I argue that Kant’s permissive law authorizes the coercion of states into such an institution but that the United Nations Security Council should be the only agent to undertake the task of such coercion. Moreover, existing juridical institutions such as the International Criminal Court ought to be reformed and a United Nations led Rapid Reaction Force should be established to carry out interventions...|$|E
5|$|The brigade traces its lineage {{back to the}} 95th Military Government Group, {{activated}} 25 August 1945. The {{group was}} assigned to Japan to provide <b>provisional</b> government <b>duties</b> during the post-World War II occupation of Japan. Following its brief assignment, the group was inactivated on 30 June 1946.|$|R
50|$|In June 2011, the Southern African Poultry Association (SAPA) filed a {{complaint}} with the International Trade Administration Commission (ITAC) of South Africa about the alleged dumping of Brazilian frozen chicken products in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) countries, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and South Africa. ITAC launched its investigation in June 2011. After examining the relevant data in the South African market between 2008 and 2010, the ITAC imposed <b>provisional</b> anti-dumping <b>duties</b> of between 6% and 63% in January 2012, following an investigation that concluded that three major Brazilian exporters sold chicken products at prices below their domesticmarket cost.|$|R
50|$|Following his suspension, Onderdonk {{remained}} Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York but {{was suspended}} from performing his <b>duties.</b> <b>Provisional</b> Bishops were consecrated {{to fill his}} duties. They were Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright I, consecrated to serve as Provisional Bishop in place of Bishop Onderdonk, 1852-1854 and Horatio Potter consecrated in 1854 to serve as Provisional Bishop in place of Onderdonk; became diocesan in 1861. His brother, Henry Ustick Onderdonk, Bishop of Pennsylvania, was also suspended upon allegations of intemperance {{during the same time}} period.|$|R

The Commission imposed a <b>provisional</b> anti-dumping <b>duty</b> on subsequent imports. This thesis eval- uates the expected and actual welfare implications for consumers in the German market after the anti-dumping duty was introduced. As Europe’s largest solar energy producer, German data on solar energy production, sampled between 2011 and 2014, as well as price levels and installation rates for solar energy provides a robust framework of analysis. By way of a mul- tiple regression analysis, {{it is found that}} the introduction of the Commission’s anti-dumping duty had a statistically insignificant effect on the production of solar electricity in the German market. Through the continued growth in solar energy production, it is found that German consumers are inelastic to changes in the price of solar energy. Prior literature underlines the prevalence of consumption preferences for consumers who exhibit the ’warm-glow’ effect and derive utility out of altruism towards the environment. The heightened consumption of solar energy in spite of rising prices underlines this effect. These conclusions enable further consider- ation for the duty’s implications for market welfare in the country, and also its implications for the wider European community. It is concluded, in contrast with classical theory on industrial organisation, that European consumers were made no worse off {{as a result of the}} anti-dumping duty, and that producers benefited...|$|R
