40|$|ABSTRACT – The Falling Sludge Bed Reactor {{is a novel}} {{bioreactor}} {{design that}} allows for increased biomass retention due to sludge settling and recycle. A mathematical model was developed to simulate the bioreactions {{taking place in the}} bioreactor being fed a mixture of <b>primary</b> <b>settled</b> sewage sludge and neutralised acid mine drainage. The aim of the bioreactor was to hydrolyse the particulate organic matter from the <b>primary</b> <b>settled</b> sewage sludge. The biological reactions taking place inside the bioreactor included the anaerobic digestion of particulate organic matter, as well as biological sulfate reduction. The reaction scheme, rate equations and kinetic constants were selected from the literature. The model was used to predict the performance of the bioreactor in order to propose operating conditions that would increase the amount of particulate organic matter that is hydrolysed. The hydraulic retention time was the most influential of the operating parameters, while the sludge recycle ratio and feed COD: SO 42 - ratio were also varied to obtain simulated trends...|$|R

When <b>primary</b> <b>settled</b> sludge solids originating from mostly domestic waste were eluted with an unsupplemented modified powdered beef extract, high virus recovery efficiency was observed upon concentration by organic flocculation.

40|$|The {{unicellular}} green alga, Chlorella vulgaris, was acclimated in wastewater for {{a period}} of 14 days before employed in treating <b>primary</b> <b>settled</b> wastewater. The acclimated cells had significantly higher cellular chlorophyll content than the unacclimated ones. The rate of chlorophyll synthesis in the acclimated cells was double that of the unacclimated cells during the initial 3 days in the course of wastewater treatment. This indicated that the acclimated cells were physiologically mole active and took up more nutrients from the wastewater for their growth and metabolism, resulting in a nutrient removal efficiency of 86 % inorganic N and 70 % inorganic P for a retention time of 2 days. Such rates were much higher than those obtained in the unacclimated system with similar algal density, where removal rates for total inorganic N and P were 54 % and 50 %, respectively.

40|$|Disinfectant {{demand and}} {{microbial}} inactivation rate are essential issues for assessing disinfection performance and proper design of disinfecting systems. In the United Kingdom and Italy, peracetic acid (PAA) has recently become an accepted disin-fectant for treating wastewaters prior to reuse in agriculture, {{and its use}} is likely to spread worldwide due to its efficacy {{as well as the}} benign nature of the by-products produced. In this paper, overall PAA demand during the advanced disinfection of municipal wastewater for agricultural reuse was evaluated under different experimental conditions. Batch tests were car-ried out using <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>settled</b> effluents sampled at the City of Taranto municipal wastewater treatment plant. PAA dosages ranged from 1. 5 to 8. 5 mg/L and from 21 to 40 mg/L for the secondary and <b>primary</b> <b>settled</b> effluents, respec-tively. Residual PAA was measured after contact times ranging from 1 to 60 min. Results showed that after a strong and almost instantaneous initial disinfectant consumption, the PAA consumption followed first-order kinetics with both efflu-ents.

Microalgae have been demonstrated as excellent nutrients stripper from the sewage. However, its application is limited by its harvesting problem {{at the end of the}} treatment process. In this study, the unicellular green alga Chlorella vulgaris was immobilized in two polysaccharide matrices, namely carrageenan and alginate, in form of spherical beads and was used to treat <b>primary</b> <b>settled</b> domestic wastewater in order to eliminate the harvesting Limitation. Growth of the algal cells in the matrices was not inhibited and the exponential growth rates were 0. 420, 0. 441 and 0. 417 day(- 1) for the free, carrageenan and alginate immobilized cells, respectively. Although algal cells in the carrageenan and alginate matrix exhibited a longer lag period (2 and 3 days, respectively) than the free cells (1 day), the immobilized cells were more metabolically active and attained a higher maximum chlorophyll content (2. 80 and 2. 34 pg cell(- 1), respectively) than the free cells (1. 4 pg cell(- 1)) in compensating the self-shading and gel screening effects. Correlated with the higher metabolic activity, over 95 % of N and 99 % of P were removed from the wastewater in 3 days by the immobilized algal beads. This was much more efficient than the free cell system which reduced only 50 % N and P in the same time regime. The interaction between the polysaccharide matrices and the nutrient ions also enhanced the nutrients removal efficiency. The polyanionicity of the carrageenan gel adsorbed the NH 4 +-N ions and shuttled them from the wastewater to the embedded algal cells, while the calcium ions associated with alginate gelling precipitated the PO 43 [...] P ions. Cell leakage was not perceivable from both carrageenan and alginate algal beads for a treatment time of 3 days. However, carrageenan algal beads was preferred for prolonged treatment time (> 3 days) or high phosphate containing wastewater. Results demonstrated that immobilized algal system could be a potential alternative system in stripping nutrients from <b>primary</b> <b>settled</b> wastewater to reduce the nutrient load from the sewage treatment plants to coastal water...|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} sewage sludge {{produced}} {{is proportional to the}} amount and concentration of wastewater treated, and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used. It can be expressed as kg dry solids per cubic metre of wastewater treated. The total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from <b>primary</b> <b>settling</b> tanks (if {{they are part of the}} process configuration) plus excess sludge from the biological treatment step. For example, primary sedimentation produces about 110-170 kg/ML of so-called primary sludge, with a value of 150 kg/ML regarded as being typical for municipal wastewater in the U.S. or Europe. The sludge production is expressed as kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 103 m3. Of the biological treatment processes, the activated sludge process produces about 70-100 kg/ML of waste activated sludge, and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process: 60-100 kg/ML. This means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of 180-270 kg/ML, being the sum of primary sludge and waste activated sludge.|$|E
50|$|RCBR {{technology}} is totally a water biological treatment system, {{able to make}} more compact and efficient the biology of any wastewaters treatment plant. For the depuration of urban wastewaters it is placed downline of primary treatments (screening, oil separation, degritting, <b>primary</b> <b>settling)</b> and upline of water physical or chemical disinfection tertiary treatments (ultraviolets, ozone). This system offers the chance to realize into restrained spaces a huge surface of cohesion for the bacteria colonies, which are active for the depuration; this aspect makes it particularly suitable also for the nitrogen removal from wastewaters, in nitro-denitro configuration. Matching a series of more modules, some of them totally submerged by the wastewaters (in anoxic conditions) operate as denitrification stadium. Others, only partially submerged into the wastewaters, in presence of oxygen, operate the carbon removal and, at the same time, the ammonium nitrification. The system simplicity and the efficiency demonstrated in the tearing down also high elevations of suspended solid and organic carbon, make it usable as a pre-treatment, upline of drinkable systems of superficial and underground polluted waters (rivers, drains, stratum, ponds and temporary puddles of rain water).|$|E

40|$|Laboratory scale batch {{experiments}} {{were employed to}} {{examine the effect of}} initial inoculum sizes of algae on their activities and reduction of nutrients form the <b>primary</b> <b>settled</b> municipal sewage. the microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris, with four initial inoculum sizes, namely `superconcentrated' (1 x 10 (7) cells ml(- 1)) `concentrated' (5 x 10 (6) cells ml(- 1)), `medium' (1 x 10 (6) cells ml(- 1)) and `low' (5 x 10 (5) cells ml(- 1)), were applied to primarily treated sewage. the cell number and chlorophyll content of all algal cultures increased gradually in the first week and the rates of increase were similar in all cultures. During the experimental period, even in the `superconcentrated' cultures, the self-shading problem was not found probably due to good mixing. At the end of the 10 days study, over 90 % HN 4 +-N and 80 % PO 43 +-P were removed from wastewater in all cultures except the `low' one. the residual concentrations of NH 4 +-N, PO 43 [...] P, TKN and total P in wastewater were negatively correlated with the cell numbers and chlorophyll content of the cultures. These results indicated that the efficiency of reducing wastewater-borne nutrients by an algal system was directly related to the physiological activity and growth of the Chlorella cells which in turn were affected by the initial inoculum size. The super-concentrated culture with an initial algal density of 1 x 10 (7) cells ml(- 1) seemed to be more beneficial as this treatment achieved satisfactory nutrient removal within 7 days instead of 10. the sharp initial reduction of COD (> 50 %) and total organic-N (> 60 %) was not related to the algal number or chlorophyll content, the performance in the control (without algal cells) was {{similar to that of the}} algal cultures.

40|$|To address {{knowledge}} gaps in {{the complex}} interacting microbial associations that underpin anaerobic digestion, a mesophilic (25 °C) continuous-flow four-stage reactor was constructed to separate both spatially and temporally the component microbial groups. The reactor influent consisted of <b>primary</b> <b>settled</b> sewage sludge (PSSS) and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). Chemical (volatile fatty acids, sulphate, sulphide, chemical oxygen demand, gas) and molecular analyses were made during an operation period of 15 months.

40|$|The {{employment}} of the unicellular green algae Chlorella was demonstrated {{as a model}} system in removing nutrients (N and P) from the <b>primary</b> <b>settled</b> wastewater in free and carrageenan immobilized states. The growth and nutrient removal performance {{was related to the}} type of organic-N substrates and affected by the bacterial interactions in the studies using synthetic wastewater. In wastewater, the nutrient removal was shown to be cell density dependent, correlated to the algal. growth and photosynthetic status in terms of chlorophyll content. Physiological acclimation process was proved to be an effective mean in reducing the retention time for treatment process. Carrageenan as an immobilizing matrix or the heating process associated with the gelling process had no adverse effect on the growth (k and μ[supscript max]), chlorophyll status, nutrient uptake and the nitrate reductase activity of C. vulgaris when compared with the free cells. Carrageenan gel beads was shown to be a NH 4 [supperscript +] shuttle in adsorbing the ion, temporary storing it and released it when ambient conditions was depleted of the ion. Simultaneous N and P removal from <b>primary</b> <b>settled</b> wastewater was found to be promising. Over 95 % N and almost complete P were removed for a retention time of 3 days. This was just half of the time required by the free cell systems operated under similar conditions. The carrageenan immobilized algal system persisted for three 3 -day cycles in a continuous batchwise operation before cell leakage became serious. Nitrogen removal effkiency dropped from 95 % in the first cycle to 65 % in the third cycle. The incorporation of a Delay process between the consecutive cycles sustained the N removal efficiency at 90 % though the leakage problem was not alleviated. The alternative incorporation of a Rehardening process extended the operation life to four cycles with a sustaining 95 % N removal throughout the process. With this understanding and proper reactor design, the upscale of the immobilized algal system is promising. The maximal cell holding capacity of the gel became a practical limitation of the immobilized system with respect to leakage problem. Good growth of the algal cells in the interior of the bead was confirmed by tracing the temporal confocal images and SEMs. Confocal microscopy is a promising diagnostic technique in delineating the spatial distribution of the algal cells in the beads...|$|R

Novel biological systems using constructed mangrove wetland and immobilized microalgal beads have been developed as alternative systems for treating different types of sewage and pollution at source. The feasibility and efficiency of constructed mangrove wetland to remove organic matter and nutrients from <b>primary</b> <b>settled</b> municipal sewage were demonstrated {{through a series of}} greenhouse experiments and a pilot-scale field trial. The treatment efficiency of constructed mangrove wetland was comparable to, or higher than, the conventional constructed wetland. An immobilized microalgal system was developed to remove toxic persistent pollutants from industrial wastewater. Pollutant-resistant microalgal species were selected for culture in domestic wastewater. The harvested biomass was immobilized in alginate beads. Bench-scale experiments showed the algal beads were effective in removing industrial pollutants such as heavy metals (e. g. Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, etc.), organometallic compounds (e. g. tributyltin, TBT), and persistent organic compounds (e. g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) through biosorption and biodegradation. The adsorbed metals could be recovered by desorption process, and the beads could be used repeatedly for many adsorption-desorption cycles. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
