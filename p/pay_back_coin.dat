But if non-Muslims disregard these sanctities, Muslims are asked to retaliate in equal measure.

40|$|We {{test whether}} {{a model of}} {{reputation}} formation in an incomplete information game, using sequential equilibrium, predicts behavior of players in an experiment. Subjects play an abstracted lending game: a B player lends or does not lend; then if B lends, an E player can <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> or renege. The game is played 8 times, {{and there is a}} small controlled probability that the E player's induced preferences make him prefer to <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> (but usually he prefers to renege). In sequential equilibrium, even E players who prefer to renege should <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> in early periods of the game, and renege with increasing frequency in later periods, to establish reputations for preferring to <b>pay</b> <b>back.</b> After many repetitions of the 8 -period game, actual play is roughly like the sequential equilibrium, except that E players <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> later in the game and more often than they should. This behavior is rational if B players have a "homemade" prior probability of. 17 (in addition to the controlled probability) that E players will prefer to <b>pay</b> <b>back.</b> We conclude that sequential equilibrium with homemade incomplete information describes actual behavior well enough that it is plausible to apply it to theoretical settings where individuals make choices (e. g., product markets, labor markets, bargaining) ...|$|R

25|$|Economist Paul McCulley {{described}} how Minsky's hypothesis translates to the subprime mortgage crisis. McCulley illustrated {{the three types}} of borrowing categories using an analogy from the mortgage market: a hedge borrower would have a traditional mortgage loan and is <b>paying</b> <b>back</b> both the principal and interest; the speculative borrower would have an interest-only loan, meaning they are <b>paying</b> <b>back</b> only the interest and must refinance later to <b>pay</b> <b>back</b> the principal; and the ponzi borrower would have a negative amortization loan, meaning the payments do not cover the interest amount and the principal is actually increasing. Lenders only provided funds to ponzi borrowers due to a belief that housing values would continue to increase.|$|R
