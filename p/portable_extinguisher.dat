50|$|Halon 1301 was {{developed}} in {{a joint venture between}} the U.S. Army and DuPont in 1954, and introduced as an effective gaseous fire suppression fixed systems agent in the 1960s, and was used around valuable materials, such as aircraft, mainframe computers, and telecommunication switching centers, usually in total flooding systems. It was also widely used in the maritime industry to add a third level of protection should the main and emergency fire pumps become inoperable or ineffective. Halon 1301 was never widely used in portables outside military and spacecraft applications, due to its limited range, and invisible discharge. It does not produce the characteristic white cloud like CO2 and is difficult to direct when fighting large fires. Halon 1301 is ideal for armored vehicles and spacecraft, however, because it produces less toxic by-products than does Halon 1211, which is critical for combat or space conditions where a compartment {{may not be able to}} be ventilated immediately. Halon 1301 is widely used by the U.S. Military and NASA in a 2-3/4 lb <b>portable</b> <b>extinguisher</b> with a sealed, disposable cylinder for quick recharging. Other agents such as CO2 and E-36 Cryotech wet chemical are largely replacing halon 1301, however, due to environmental concerns. Civilian models in 2-3/4, 3, and 4 lb sizes were also made.|$|E

40|$|Investigations of past fires {{suggest that}} {{building}} occupants {{faced with a}} fire have problems defining the severity of it, especially {{in the early stages}} of the fire. An experiment was therefore carried out to study people’s ability to estimate fire growth, and their perceived ability to extinguish a fire using a <b>portable</b> fire <b>extinguisher.</b> A total of 535 persons, namely 304 men and 231 women, were asked to fill out a questionnaire that was divided into three parts. In the first part the test participants were asked to estimate the time between different stages of a fire. The second part involved estimations of the own ability to extinguish a fire with a <b>portable</b> fire <b>extinguisher.</b> The third part involved general questions about age, gender and academic background. The results suggest that people in general are not very good at defining the severity of a fire when it is visually accessible. Estimations of the fire growth did not correspond very well to the actual fire growth, and a great proportion of the test participants believed that they had not been able to extinguish an extinguishable fire using a <b>portable</b> fire <b>extinguisher.</b> It is therefore argued that the perceived risk not always conforms to the real risk in a fire situation where the fire is visually accessible. The results can be used to explain why building occupants not immediately initiate evacuation in a fire situation, even when the fire is visually accessible...|$|R
