40|$|Abstract. Metered mail {{provides}} substantial {{opportunities for}} fraud. (Indeed, losses due to meter {{fraud in the}} United States are said to exceed $ 100 million annually.) We apply cryptographic techniques to prevent several types of improper use of metering indicia. This paper describes a mail system that combines o-the-shelf barcode technology, tamper-proof devices, and cryptography in a fully-integrated secure franking system. This system provides protection against: 1. Tampering with <b>postage</b> <b>meters</b> to fraudulently obtain extra postage� 2. Forging and copying of postal indicia� 3. Unauthorized use of <b>postage</b> <b>meters</b> � and 4.

50|$|By 1919, {{the two men}} {{combined}} their {{firms and}} the Pitney-Bowes <b>Postage</b> <b>Meter</b> Company was born. While Pitney was the inventor, Bowes concentrated his activities in Washington, lobbying for {{the passage of the}} necessary legislation that would open the door for the <b>postage</b> <b>meter.</b> The United States Congress passed the enabling legislation in 1920, and the first piece of metered mail—a letter from Bowes to his wife—was posted on December 10, 1920. By 1922, 400 meters were in service, accounting for more than $4 million in postage.|$|R

50|$|A meter stamp, or meter mark, is the {{impression}} {{made by a}} <b>postage</b> <b>meter</b> machine that indicates that postage has been paid on a letter or parcel. Meter stamps are widely used by businesses and organisations as they are more efficient than using postage stamps.|$|R
50|$|Metered reply mail, or MRM, {{is a type}} of mail {{in which}} a {{business}} sends pre-printed, self-addressed envelopes or postcards to customers, with postage prepaid on the envelopes or postcards with a <b>postage</b> <b>meter.</b> It is thus similar to courtesy reply mail with a postage stamp already affixed.|$|R
50|$|Pitney and Bowes {{set up a}} {{manufacturing}} presence in Stamford, Connecticut and by 1922 there were branch offices in a dozen major cities and the Pitney-Bowes <b>postage</b> <b>meter</b> was also approved for use in Canada and England.

50|$|There {{have been}} many {{experiments}} with similar systems over the years but none has been truly successful until the evolution of modern sophisticated computer printing technology.
