50|$|In April 1851, {{the rate}} for inland letters to Canada, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island was 3d per ½ oz. Letters to the USA was 6d per ½ oz, {{excluding}} California and Oregon, which was 9d per ½ oz. The first issues were made on laid paper, which did not stick as well to envelopes; thus in 1852 the <b>printers</b> <b>switched</b> to wove paper. All of these early stamps were imperforate issues. These earliest issues on laid paper are quite rare; {{a grand total of}} only 1,450 copies of the 12d were ever issued. Copies today, depending on their condition, may sell for US$50,000 or more.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company has}} a long history. In the 1970s {{it was called the}} Expandor {{division}} of Micom Systems, and offered <b>printer</b> <b>switches</b> popularly called [...] "black boxes". It published a popular [...] "Black Box Catalog". Another division, Interlan, sold local area network equipment.After a slow-down in business in the mid-1980s and Black Monday of 1987, Odyssey Partners acquired the company in 1988, through a leveraged buyout. A proposed sale was met with a lawsuit, although the Interlan division was sold to Racal in 1989.Micom was re-organized in 1990 after losses from the debt servicing. Despite getting $5.5 million in fees for the deal, Drexel Burnham Lambert filed for its own bankruptcy the same year. The no-action letter from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in June 1990 {{has been used as a}} legal precedent for similar cases.|$|R
50|$|Printer Job Language (PJL) is {{a method}} {{developed}} by Hewlett-Packard for <b>switching</b> <b>printer</b> languages at the job level, and for status readback between the printer and the host computer. PJL adds job level controls, such as <b>printer</b> language <b>switching,</b> job separation, environment, status readback, device attendance and file system commands. While PJL was conceived as an extension to Printer Command Language (PCL), it is now supported by most PostScript printers. Many printer vendors have extended PJL to include commands proprietary to their products. Not all PJL commands documented by HP are implemented in all HP or other vendor products. PJL resides above all the other printer languages and parses commands first. The syntax mainly uses plain English words.|$|R
50|$|Most {{printers}} {{other than}} line printers accept control characters or unique character sequences to control various printer functions. These may range from shifting from lower to upper case or from black to red ribbon on typewriter <b>printers</b> to <b>switching</b> fonts and changing character sizes and colors on raster printers. Early printer controls were not standardized, with each manufacturer's equipment having its own set. The IBM Personal Printer Data Stream (PPDS) became a commonly used command set for dot-matrix printers.|$|R
5000|$|Many printer {{manufactures}} {{provide their}} cartridges with chips and/or sensors to prevent refilling. These chips can {{also serve as}} a [...] "copy protection," [...] so that the printer does not work with cartridges made by other manufacturers. In such cases, the refilling process must include the bypassing of those anti-refilling protections. (Refill instructions, chip resetters or autoreset chips latter are reset each time the <b>printer</b> is <b>switched</b> on for different cartridge models, and other tools are available on the Internet.) ...|$|R

50|$|Printer's {{errors in}} Baird's 1858 {{publication}} led to longstanding confusion and contention over {{the naming of}} the crissal thrasher. As printed, Baird's publication identified the new species as Toxostoma dorsalis, because the <b>printer</b> had <b>switched</b> the species name of the new thrasher with the species name of a new junco species, Junco dorsalis. Baird arranged for the error to be corrected, recording the name as T. crissalis the following month. Thereafter, the T. crissalis name was accepted and used until 1920, when ornithologist Harry Oberholser published a note asserting that T. dorsalis must be used instead because it had publication priority over T. crissalis, even though the original publication {{had been a mistake}} and had been quickly corrected. As a result, the T. dorsalis epithet appeared in ornithological literature until 1983, when the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature formally restored Baird's intended name of T. crissale.|$|R

5000|$|A Standard BASIC {{cartridge}} {{was included}} with the machine. This cartridge was essentially the common Microsoft BASIC already widely used in the CP/M world. One modification was the addition of single-stroke replacements for common BASIC commands, pressing GRAPHICS-P would insert the word [...] for instance, allowing for higher-speed entry. The machine included sound in/out ports on the back that could be attached to a cassette tape recorder, so BASIC could load and save programs to tape without needing a disk drive. An Extended BASIC cartridge requiring 16 KB was also advertised, but it is unclear if this was actually available; Extended BASIC from Microsoft was available on cassette. Another popular cartridge was the Word Processor PAC which contained {{a version of the}} early word processor program Spellbinder. A constant ROM fault in the wordprocessor PAC was a <b>printer</b> status <b>switch</b> setting for the printer, but most people learned about it and turned it off early in their power-on.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Particulate air {{pollution}} was demonstrated to have serious {{short and long-term}} health effects, in particular in indoor environments. There is little literature data available to compare particle number concentrations measured in the office environment. Objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the particle number concentration levels in a controlled dynamic office environment. METHODS A Kanomax Model 3887 Handheld Laser Particle Counter was used for continuous (3 h), repeated (sample time 60 s with logging interval of 10 min) and real-time measurements of total number concentrations of particles in the range from 0. 3 µm to 5 µm. The particle counter has a calibrated flow rate of 2. 83 L/min,verified to ± 5 %accuracy. Particle concentrations were studied in a work environment characterized by the presence of three printers. Measurements were performed in different conditions: when printers were off,immediately after the printers had printed one page and after 20 minutes of operative printing process. Same measurements were taken with more or individually <b>printers</b> <b>switched</b> on and with air intake and/or emission switched on/off. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 17. 0. RESULTS Preliminary analysis of the particle number concentrations showed clear variation (one-way ANOVA, p< 0. 005) during printing time and printers “at rest” in each environmental condition of air intake and/or emission. The average number concentration for particle with diameter of 0. 3 – 0. 5 – 5 µm during printing time were 9. 21 x 106 m- 3 (± 7. 32 x 104 m- 3 SD), 5. 09 x 105 m- 3 (± 4. 93 x 104 m- 3 SD), 4. 24 x 103 m- 3 (± 1. 62 x 103 m- 3 SD) respectively, values about three times higher than that during non operative printing process. Particle concentration was not depending significantly on the number of pages printed. The switching on of the air extractor showed to decrease significantly the 5 µm particle number concentrations (p< 0. 005). Further investigations are underway. CONCLUSIONS The control and the possibility of cutting down such emissions allow to hypothesize procedures and control measures for exposed workers’ protection. The widespread use of information technology in private homes, mostly by young people, makes it an interesting topic beyond the occupational medicine...|$|R
40|$|Printer X is a {{printing}} facility operating since 1989, the present owner and president, bought Printer X in 1990. In their facility, they use print {{processes such as}} off set lithographs, letterpresses, duplicators and a new system called an I-Tech system. Printer X is organized, and they purchase supplies only when needed. They generate close to no paper wastes, and limited amount of hazardous wastes. They also recycle their solvents with a reusable metal filter. All of Printer X employees are well trained for the printing facility. Printer X {{has the potential to}} be an even more environmentally friendly facility. Overall, Printer X practices many pollution preventions techniques. Of the pollution prevention suggestions, the potential in cost savings is at least $ 21, 400 in yearly savings ($l, 800 /month), and the potential in waste reduction of 1, 224 ounces/year of ink, 30 gal/year of fountain solution, 876 -polymer plates/year, and 12 gal cube/year of photographic film chemicals.

50|$|Starting with issue #6 {{the paper}} <b>switched</b> <b>{{printers}}</b> from Waller Press (which later {{served as the}} printers for the San Francisco Express Times) to Howard Quinn Printers. At the Howard Quinn shop the paper's artists were allowed to come in on Sundays when the paper was being printed and experiment with the presses, {{and it was at}} this time that the revolutionary split-fountain rainbow inking effect was perfected. This involved placing makeshift wooden dams in the ink fountain and using them to feed different colored inks simultaneously into the fountain, which produced a rainbow effect which was a bit difficult to read but visually arresting.|$|R

The “Roller Recover Program” allows customers to send Böttcher America used rollers to be recovered with new rubber. A customer can also order rollers through the “Exchange Roller Program” and a press-ready roller will be shipped. The customer is billed for the rubber only and has 60 days to return the core(s).Böttcher is the OEM roller supplier to the major sheet-fed press manufacturers including Heidelberg, MAN Roland, KBA, Komori and Mitsubishi.Böttcher America has won two awards for its products. In 1993, the company won a GATF award in recognition of the glaze free rollers technology (79 Series Rubber Compounds). In 2005, Böttcher America won a new PIA/GATF award for its Chameleon rubber roller compound which enables <b>printers</b> to <b>switch</b> freely among different inks (conventional, UV or hybrid) without changing printing rollers.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLately, the meshed {{topology}} of the DC microgrids {{has shown}} increasing interest {{in research and}} industrial communities since it provides higher reliability and optimizes {{the performance of the}} system.

This work presents some preliminary studies on the control and optimization scheduling of a DC microgrid with meshed topology. The considered microgrid is connected to the utility grid (UG) and includes a solar panel (PV), an energy storage (ES) system, electrical vehicles (EV) and different types of DC loads such as <b>printers</b> or computers. <b>Switching</b> devices (inverters, converters, DC-breaker and the like) connect the sources and the loads to the DC bus and enable the control of the system's power transmission...|$|R
500|$|After the Spring 1953 issue Nova Publications {{decided to}} <b>switch</b> <b>printers,</b> {{in order to}} cut costs and bring the cover price down from 2/- (10 p) to 1/6 (7.5 p). The new printers, The Carlton Press, failed to keep to the agreed {{printing}} schedule, and produced poor quality work; there were also printers' strikes, and this disruption caused extended delays in the appearance of the seventh issue. While the dispute with the printers was going on, Carnell and Maurice Goldsmith, a journalist acquaintance of Carnell's, put together a small conference of well-known science fiction authors, including Arthur C. Clarke and John Wyndham. Goldsmith covered the conference for Illustrated, a weekly magazine, and the article caught the attention of Maclaren & Sons Ltd, a technical trade publisher interested in launching a new sf magazine. [...] Carnell turned down the offer because of his loyalty to Nova Publications, but subsequent discussions ultimately led to Maclaren taking control of Nova Publications, with a commitment to produce New Worlds on a monthly basis and Science Fantasy on a bimonthly schedule. Maclaren's legal department was helpful in resolving the dispute with The Carlton Press, and the seventh issue of Science Fantasy finally appeared with a cover date of March 1954.|$|R
5000|$|When a Windows PC {{controls}} a LaserJet, the [...] "Form Feed" [...] button seldom {{does anything}} when pressed. It {{has a small}} indicator light, and was usually used with very simple DOS programs that did not eject the last page after sending data to the printer, though {{it could also be}} useful to print the data in the printer's memory if a program failed in the middle of sending a page to be printed. (In certain cases, this might {{be the only way to}} recover one's data in the event of a system crash that occurred while printing.) The Form Feed button would print whatever was remaining in memory and prepare the printer to accept any new data as the start of a new page. Note that for at least some LaserJet models, notably the LaserJet 4MPlus, the <b>printer</b> must be <b>switched</b> off-line before the Form Feed button will work. Most users of dot-matrix printers in the 1980s probably found the Online and Form Feed functions obvious, as most dot-matrix printers had these buttons and they worked similarly. The indicator on the Form Feed button illuminates when there is received data in the printer's buffer; this makes it much easier to predict what will happen if the printer is put online and a new job is sent to it, or if sending of a job in progress is resumed.|$|R
40|$|In todays {{connected}} society, with rapidly advancing technology, {{there is}} an interest in offering technical services in our day to day life. Since these services are used to handle sensitive information and money, there are demands for increased information security. Sometimes errors occur in these systems that risk the security for both parties. These systems should be secured to maintain secure operations even though vulnerabilities occur. Outpost 24 is one company that specializes in vulnerability management. By using their scanning tool OUTSCAN™, Outpost 24 can identify vulnerabilities in network components, such as firewalls, <b>switches,</b> <b>printers,</b> devices, servers, workstations and other computer systems. These results are then stored in a database. Within this study, the authors will work together with Outpost 24 towards this data. The goal is to define a process for generation of vulnerability reports for the company. The process will perform a statistical {{analysis of the data}} and present the findings. To solve the task a report was created, during which the process was documented. The work began with a background study into Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), in which the most common security KPIs were identified from similar works. A tool was also developed to help with the analysis. This resulted in a statistical analysis using Outpost 24 ’s dataset. By presenting the data formatted by the KPIs, trends could be identified. This showed an overall trend of increasing vulnerabilities and the necessity for organizations to spend resources towards security. The KPIs offer other possibilities, such as creating a baseline for security evaluation using data from one year. In the future, one could use the KPIs to compare how the security situation has changed...|$|R
