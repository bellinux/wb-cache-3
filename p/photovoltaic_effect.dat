In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide, although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954.

25|$|A {{solar cell}} is any device that {{directly}} converts the energy in light into electrical energy {{through the process}} of photovoltaics. Although French physicist Antoine-César Becquerel discovered the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>effect</b> much earlier in 1839, the first solar cell, according to Encyclopædia Britannica, was invented by Charles Fritts in 1883, who used junctions formed by coating selenium with an extremely thin layer of gold. In 1941, the silicon solar cell was invented by another American named Russell Ohl. Drawing upon Ohl's work, three American researchers named Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller, and Daryl Chapin essentially introduced the first practical use of solar panels through their improvement of the silicone solar cell in 1954, which by placing them in direct sunlight, free electrons are turned into electric current enabling a six percent energy conversion efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>effect</b> is the {{transformation}} of light into electrical energy, as in solar cells. Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to electricity. Although sunlight is free and abundant, solar electricity is still usually more expensive to produce than large-scale mechanically generated power due {{to the cost of}} the panels. Low-efficiency silicon solar cells have been decreasing in cost and multijunction cells with close to 30% conversion efficiency are now commercially available. Over 40% efficiency has been demonstrated in experimental systems. Until recently, photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid, or as a supplemental electricity source for individual homes and businesses. Recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology, combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns, have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels. Installed capacity is growing by 40% per year led by increases in Germany, Japan, and the United States.|$|E

Therefore, a combination of photocatalysts and C 60 might provide an ideal system to achieve enhanced charge separation by photoinduced electron transfer. Some fullerene-donor linked molecules on an electrode were reported to exhibit excellent <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>effects</b> upon photo-irradiation.|$|R

40|$|Optimal {{materials}} to induce bulk <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>effects</b> should lack inversion symmetry {{and have an}} optical gap matching the energies of visible radiation. Ferroelectric perovskite oxides such as BaTiO$_ 3 $ and PbTiO$_ 3 $ exhibit substantial polarization and stability, but have the disadvantage of excessively large band gaps. We use both density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory calculations to design {{a new class of}} Mott multiferroics [...] double perovskite oxides $A_ 2 $VFeO$_ 6 $ ($A$=Ba, Pb, etc). While neither perovskite $A$VO$_ 3 $ nor $A$FeO$_ 3 $ is ferroelectric, in the double perovskite $A_ 2 $VFeO$_ 6 $ a `complete' charge transfer from V to Fe leads to a non-bulk-like charge configuration [...] an empty V-$d$ shell and a half-filled Fe-$d$ shell, giving rise to a polarization comparable to that of ferroelectric $A$TiO$_ 3 $. Different from nonmagnetic $A$TiO$_ 3 $, the new double perovskite oxides have an antiferromagnetic ground state and around room temperatures, are paramagnetic Mott insulators. Most importantly, the V $d^ 0 $ state significantly reduces the band gap of $A_ 2 $VFeO$_ 6 $, making it smaller than that of $A$TiO$_ 3 $ and BiFeO$_ 3 $ and rendering the new multiferroics a promising candidate to induce bulk <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>effects.</b> Comment: 27 pages, 6 figures and 3 table...|$|R
40|$|Optogenetics allows light {{activation}} of genetically defined cell populations {{and the study}} of their link to specific brain functions. While it is a powerful method that has revolutionized neuroscience in the last decade, the shortcomings of directly stimulating electrodes and living tissue with light have been poorly characterized. Here, we assessed the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>effects</b> in local field potential (LFP) recordings of the mouse hippocampus. We found that light leads to several artifacts that resemble genuine LFP features in animals with no opsin expression, such as stereotyped peaks at the power spectrum, phase shifts across different recording channels, coupling between low and high oscillation frequencies, and sharp signal deflections that are detected as spikes. Further, we tested how light stimulation affected hippocampal LFP recordings in mice expressing channelrhodopsin 2 in parvalbumin neurons (PV/ChR 2 mice). Genuine oscillatory activity at the frequency of light stimulation could not be separated from light-induced artifacts. In addition, light stimulation in PV/ChR 2 mice led to an overall decrease in LFP power. Thus, genuine LFP changes caused by the stimulation of specific cell populations may be intermingled with spurious changes caused by <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>effects.</b> Our data suggest that care should be taken in the interpretation of electrophysiology experiments involving light stimulation...|$|R

50|$|The first {{demonstration}} of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>effect</b> in 1839 used an electrochemical cell, but the most familiar form of the <b>photovoltaic</b> <b>effect</b> in modern times though is in solid-state devices, mainly in photodiodes. When sunlight or other sufficiently energetic light is incident upon the photodiode, the electrons present in the valence band absorb energy and, being excited, jump to the conduction band and become free. These excited electrons diffuse, and some reach the rectifying junction (usually a p-n junction) where they are accelerated into a different material by a built-in potential (Galvani potential). This generates an electromotive force, and thus some of the light energy is converted into electric energy.
