40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} approximation algorithms for optimizing a generic multi-variate homogeneous polynomial function, subject to homogeneous quadratic constraints. Such opti-mization models have wide applications, e. g., in signal processing, {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), data training, approximation theory, and portfolio selection. Since polynomial functions are non-convex in general, the problems under consideration are all NP-hard. In this paper we shall focus on polynomial-time approximation algorithms. In particular, we first study optimiza-tion of a multi-linear tensor function over the Cartesian product of spheres. We shall propose approximation algorithms for such problem and derive worst-case <b>performance</b> <b>ratios,</b> which are shown to depend only on {{the dimensions of the}} models. The methods are then extended to op-timize a generic multi-variate homogeneous polynomial function with spherical constraint. Like-wise, approximation algorithms are proposed with provable relative approximation <b>performance</b> <b>ratios.</b> Furthermore, the constraint set is relaxed to be an intersection of co-centered ellipsoids. In particular, {{we consider}} maximization of a homogeneous polynomial over the intersection of ellip-soids centered at the origin, and propose polynomial-time approximation algorithms with provable worst-case <b>performance</b> <b>ratios.</b> Numerical results are reported, illustrating the effectiveness of the approximation algorithms studied...|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{for planning and}} design of energy efficient buildings is presented and analysed. The starting point is the definition that energy efficiency {{is a question of}} minimizing the energy end-use within realistic economic frames and fully preserved function. The methodology is based on a systematic approach to the issue of energy efficiency. One element in this is the introduction of a number of energy related <b>ratios,</b> Energy <b>Performance</b> <b>Ratios,</b> that characterise the influence of building parts and the technical systems of the building on the energy end-use of the building as an entirety. These ratios are selected and formulated so that they facilitate a systematic strive towards high energy efficiency when applied in planning and design of buildings. One basic moment is to elucidate the energy interaction between different parts and systems of the building in order make it easier to avoid sub-optimised solutions. This is done by introducing an imaginary division of the building into, from an energy end-use point of view, characteristic system parts on different levels of interaction with other parts. The build up of the Energy <b>Performance</b> <b>Ratios</b> follows this division. Therewith the application of these ratios contributes to a comprehensive view when designing the building. Another basic moment is the setting of Energy Targets to aim at when building parts, technical systems and components are designed and rated. This is done by quantifying the Energy <b>Performance</b> <b>Ratios.</b> A substantial part of the work deals with the quantification of Energy <b>Performance</b> <b>Ratios</b> to realistic Energy Targets. This is done by a combination of analyses of existing monitored buildings and theoretical simulations and calculations. In the present work the methodology is applied primarily on design and rating of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems with a focus on commercial buildings. However, the methodology itself is not meant to be limited to these applications. The basic idea is that it should be applied on all the parts of the building that have an obvious influence on the energy end-use...|$|R
