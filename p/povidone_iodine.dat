A total of 200 osteochondral specimens were obtained. All 200 specimens were dropped on the operating room floor for fifteen seconds and {{assigned to one of}} four experimental groups. Group I samples were cultured after washing with normal saline solution (Control group). In other three groups, prior to culturing process, samples were placed in an antibiotic solution after washing with normal saline (Neomycin & Polymyxin) (group II), Chlorhexidine 0. 4 % (group III), and <b>povidone</b> – <b>iodine</b> 10 % (group IV), respectively.  Results: In group I, 25 of 50 specimens had positive cultures. Of 50 specimens of group II, III and IV, no positive cultures were found after 10 days.  Conclusion: all three agents including antibiotic solution, povidone-iodine 10 % and chlorhexidine 0. 4 % seem effective in sterilizing the contaminated osteochondral samples. According to the literature, povidone-iodine has no negative effect on the cartilage metabolism and seems to be a proper choice of decontaminating solution for osteochondral plugs.

50|$|Shampoo {{intended}} for animals may contain insecticides or other medications {{for treatment of}} skin conditions or parasite infestations such as fleas or mange. These must never be used on humans. While some human shampoos may be harmful when used on animals, any human haircare products that contain active ingredients or drugs (such as zinc in anti-dandruff shampoos) are potentially toxic when ingested by animals. Special {{care must be taken}} not to use those products on pets. Cats are at particular risk due to their instinctive method of grooming their fur with their tongues.Shampoos that are especially designed to be used on pets, commonly dogs and cats, are normally intended {{to do more than just}} clean the pet's coat or skin. Most of these shampoos contain ingredients which act differently and are meant to treat a skin condition or an allergy or to fight against fleas.The main ingredients contained by pet shampoos can be grouped in insecticidals, antiseborrheic, antibacterials, antifungals, emollients, emulsifiers and humectants. Whereas some of these ingredients may be efficient in treating some conditions, pet owners are recommended to use them according to their veterinarian's indications because many of them cannot be used on cats or can harm the pet if it is misused.Generally, insecticidal pet shampoos contain pyrethrin, pyrethroids (such as permethrin and which may not be used on cats) and carbaryl. These ingredients are mostly found in shampoos that are meant to fight against parasite infestations.Antifungal shampoos are used on pets with yeast or ringworm infections. These might contain ingredients such as miconazole, chlorhexidine, providone iodine, ketoconazole or selenium sulfide (which cannot be used on cats).Bacterial infections in pets are sometimes treated with antibacterial shampoos. They commonly contain benzoyl peroxide, chlorhexidine, <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine,</b> triclosan, ethyl lactate, or sulfur.Antipruritic shampoos are intended to provide relief of itching due to conditions such as atopy and other allergies. These usually contain colloidal oatmeal, hydrocortisone, Aloe vera, pramoxine hydrochloride, menthol, diphenhydramine, sulfur or salicylic acid. These ingredients are aimed to reduce the inflammation, cure the condition and ease the symptoms at the same time while providing comfort to the pet.Antiseborrheic shampoos are those especially designed for pets with scales or those with excessive oily coats. These shampoos are made of sulfur, salicylic acid, refined tar (which cannot be used on cats), selenium sulfide (cannot be used on cats) and benzoyl peroxide. All these are meant to treat or prevent seborrhea oleosa, which is a condition characterized by excess oils. Dry scales can be prevented and treated with shampoos that contain sulfur or salicylic acid and which can be used on both cats and dogs.Emollient shampoos are efficient in adding oils to the skin and relieving the symptoms of a dry and itchy skin. They usually contain oils such as almond, corn, cottonseed, coconut, olive, peanut, Persia, safflower, sesame, lanolin, mineral or paraffin oil. The emollient shampoos are typically used with emulsifiers as they help distributing the emollients. These include ingredients such as cetyl alcohol, laureth-5, lecithin, PEG-4 dilaurate, stearic acid, stearyl alcohol, carboxylic acid, lactic acid, urea, sodium lactate, propylene glycol, glycerin, or polyvinylpyrrolidone.Although some of the pet shampoos are highly effective, some others may be less effective for some condition than another. Yet, although natural pet shampoos exist, it has been brought to attention that some of these might cause irritation to the skin of the pet. Natural ingredients that might be potential allergens for some pets include eucalyptus, lemon or orange extracts and tea tree oil. On the contrary, oatmeal appears to be one of the most widely skin-tolerated ingredients that is found in pet shampoos.Most ingredients found in a shampoo meant to be used on animals are safe for the pet as there is a high likelihood that the pets will lick their coats, especially in the case of cats.Pet shampoos which include fragrances, deodorants or colors may harm the skin of the pet by causing inflammations or irritation. Shampoos that do not contain any unnatural additives are known as hypoallergenic shampoos and are increasing in popularity.|$|E

Materials and Methods: Total of 40 eyes ofrom 20 wild rabbits were randomly assigned to four equal groups, five in each (n = 5), they included; group 1. 5 % <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> and vancomycin; group 2. 5 % <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> and cefazolin; group 3. 10 % <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> and vancomycin; group 4. 10 % <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> and cefazolin (one drop every two hours for seven days and nights). The animals were first anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine chloride. Then, a 27 -gauge needle attached to a 1 -ml syringe was tunneled through the clear cornea to approximately midstromal depth, stopping at the edge of the 2 -mm optical zone. Finally, 0. 02 ml of Staphylococcus contaminated media containing about 100 organisms was injected, forming a central intra-stromal infiltrate. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the density of infiltration, size of infiltration, hypopyon, or fibrin formation between the four groups. However, epithelial defect, stromal edema, conjunctival injection, and chemosis were significantly higher in the 5 % and 10 % <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> groups when compared to the cefazolin and vancomycin groups. Thinning was more common in the cefazolin group. There was one sealed corneal perforation in the cefazolin group at the beginning, and at day 6, one perforation in the cefazolin group and one perforation in the 10 % <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> group also developed. Conclusions: Cefazolin and vancomycin had a superior clinical effect on the staphylococcal corneal ulcers in this study. 5 % and 10 % <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> was toxic to the corneal epithelium. Thinning and perforation was more common with cefazolin [...] Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:Lower effect of <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> may be the result of the lack of deep penetration of this drug into the corneal stroma, but other factors may be involved.

40|$|The oral care of {{unconscious}} {{patients should}} not be ignored and requires oral antiseptics that have antibacterial properties. This research was a quasi-experimental design with control groups, using pre-post test design. The study was aimed to compare the amount of bacteria colonies after oral care using <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> 1 % and chlorhexidine 0. 2 % on the patients with altered state of consciousness. Using consecutive sampling technique, 30 eligible respondents were divided into three groups. The {{results of this study}} identified that there was a significant decreased of the amount of bacteria colonies after oral care using <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> (p= 0. 007), chlorhexidine (p= 0. 001) and water oral care (p= 0. 001). The difference of the number of colonies for oral care using <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> 1 %, chlorhexidine 0. 2 %, and the control group was not significant (p= 0. 343). It can be concluded that each of oral care using chlorhexidine 0. 2 %, <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> 1 % and water has a significant ability to reduce colonies of bacteria and can be used as an oral care. For economic reason, it was advised to use water for oral care if clients do not experience oral infections, and to use chlorhexidine 0. 2 % or <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> 1 % when there is infection of the mouth. Oral care klien penurunan tingkat kesadaran tidak boleh diabaikan dan membutuhkan antiseptik oral yang mempunyai sifat antibakteri. Penelitian ini adalah penelitian kuantitatif dengan desain quasi eksperimen dengan kelompok kontrol, pre dan post test untuk mengidentifikasi perbandingkan <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> 1 % dengan chlorhexidine 0. 2 % terhadap jumlah koloni bakteri di mulut klien penurunan kesadaran. Hasil penelitian pada 30 responden yang diambil secara consecutive sampling dibagi tiga kelompok. Ada perbedaan yang signifikan penurunan jumlah koloni bakteri sebelum dan setelah oral care pada <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> (p= 0. 007), chlorhexidine (p= 0. 001) dan air (p= 0. 001). Perbandingan selisih jumlah bakteri antara <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> 1 %, chlorhexidine 0. 2 % dan kontrol tidak signifikan (p= 0, 343). Disimpulkan chlorhexidine 0. 2 %, <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> 1 % dan air minum masing-masing mempunyai kemampuan yang signifikan menurunkan koloni bakteri dan dapat digunakan sebagai pembilas oral care. Disarankan secara ekonomis air minum digunakan dalam oral care apabila klien penurunan kesadaran tidak mengalami infeksi mulut, dan chlorhexidine 0. 2 % atau <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> 1 % digunakan bila ada infeksi mulut...|$|E

They are essential parts of infection control practices, especially in wound treatment and aid in the prevention of nosocomial infections. This study was done to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effectiveness of <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> and eight commonly used homoeopathic mother tinctures. Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted in the Faculty of Pharmacy and alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur. All the selected Homeopathic mother tinctures were purchased by Masood Homeopathic Pharmaceuticals, Pakistan. Prepared PYODINEâ (<b>povidone</b> <b>iodine)</b> solution 10 % w/v, batch no. 084 F 4 used as positive control while 70 % ethanol was used as negative control in each test. These tinctures were tested against three clinically important human skin-pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) by disc diffusion method with <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> as positive standard. Results: Seven out of eight mother tinctures showed more or less antibacterial activity; some of them have high activity than <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine.</b> Rhus glabra had maximum activity (zone of inhibition 32 mm) against Streptococcus pyogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than <b>povidone</b> <b>iodine</b> and among all the tested mother tinctures.
