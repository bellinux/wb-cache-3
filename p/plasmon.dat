25|$|Real-time based methods, {{which are}} often label-free, such as surface <b>plasmon</b> resonance, dual {{polarization}} interferometry and Multi-Parametric Surface <b>Plasmon</b> Resonance (MP-SPR) can not only quantify the affinity from concentration based assays; {{but also from the}} kinetics of association and dissociation, and in the later cases, the conformational change induced upon binding. MP-SPR also enables measurements in high saline dissociation buffers thanks to a unique optical setup. Microscale Thermophoresis (MST), an immobilization-free method was developed. This method allows the determination of the binding affinity without any limitation to the ligand's molecular weight.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{choice of}} plasmatic metal nano-particles {{is crucial for}} the maximum light {{absorption}} in the active layer. Front surface located nano-particles Ag and Au are {{the most widely used}} materials due to their surface <b>plasmon</b> resonances located in the visible range and therefore interact more strongly with the peak solar intensity. However, such noble metal nano-particles always introduce reduced light coupling into Si at the short wavelengths below the surface <b>plasmon</b> resonance due to the detrimental Fano effect, i.e. the destructive interference between the scattered and unscattered light. Moreover, the noble metal nano-particles are impractical to implement for large-scale solar cell manufacture due to their high cost and scarcity in the earth's crust. Recently, Zhang et al. have demonstrated the low cost and earth abundant materials Al nano-particles to be able to outperform the widely used Ag and Au nano-particles. Al nano-particles, with their surface <b>plasmon</b> resonances located in the UV region below the desired solar spectrum edge at 300nm, can avoid the reduction and introduce extra enhancement in the shorter wavelength range.|$|E

25|$|A {{plasmonic}} {{solar cell}} {{is a type}} of thin film solar cell that converts light into electricity with the assistance of plasmons. Plasmonic cells improve absorption by scattering light using metal nano-particles excited at their surface <b>plasmon</b> resonance. Incoming light at the <b>plasmon</b> resonance frequency induces electron oscillations at the surface of the nanoparticles. The oscillation electrons can then be captured by a conductive layer producing an electrical current. The voltage produced is dependent on the bandgap of the conductive layer and the potential of the electrolyte in contact with the nanoparticles. There is still considerable research necessary to enable the technology to reach its full potential and commercialization of plasmonic enhanced solar cells.|$|E

40|$|We study plasma {{effects on}} {{radiative}} transitions (e. g., decay of excited states of atoms or atomic nuclei) in a dense plasma at the transition frequencies ω≲ω_p (where ω_p is the electron plasma frequency). The decay goes through four channels [...] the emission of real transverse and longitudinal <b>plasmons</b> {{as well as}} the emission of virtual transverse and longitudinal <b>plasmons</b> with subsequent absorption of such <b>plasmons</b> by the plasma. The emission of real <b>plasmons</b> dies out at ω≤ω_p, but the processes with virtual <b>plasmons</b> strongly enhance the radiative decay.

25|$|Recently, {{the core}} (metal)-shell (dielectric) {{nanoparticle}} has demonstrated a zero backward scattering with enhanced forward scattering on Si substrate when surface <b>plasmon</b> {{is located in}} front of a solar cell. The core-shell nanoparticles can support simultaneously both electric and magnetic resonances, demonstrating entirely new properties when compared with bare metallic nanoparticles if the resonances are properly engineered.|$|E
25|$|Metals {{can also}} be an {{effective}} way to confine light in structures equal to or smaller than the optical wavelength. This effect is emergent from the confined surface <b>plasmon</b> resonance induced by the resonating light, which, when confined to the surface of a nanostructure such as a gold channel or nanorod, induces electromagnetic resonance. Surface <b>plasmon</b> effects are strong in the visible range because the permittivity of a metal is very large and negative at visible frequencies. At frequencies higher than the visible range, the permittivity of a metal is closer to zero, and the metal stops being useful for focussing electric and magnetic fields. This effect was originally observed in radio and microwave engineering, where metal antennas and waveguides may be hundreds of times smaller than the free-space wavelength. In the same way, visible light can be constricted to the nano level with metal structures which form channels, tips, gaps, etc. Gold is also a convenient choice for nanofabrication because of its unreactivity and ease of use with chemical vapour deposition.|$|E
25|$|The surface <b>plasmon</b> {{polariton}} (SPP) is an electromagnetic {{surface wave}} that travels along an interface between two media with different dielectric constants. It exists under {{the condition that}} the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative, while the other one is positive, as is the case for the interface between air and a lossy conducting medium below the plasma frequency. The wave propagates parallel to the interface and decays exponentially vertical to it, a property called evanescence. Since the wave is on the boundary of a lossy conductor and a second medium, these oscillations can be sensitive to changes to the boundary, such as the adsorption of molecules by the conducting surface.|$|E

40|$|With the {{intriguing}} properties of diffraction-free, self-accelerating, and self-healing, Airy <b>plasmons</b> are promising {{to be used}} in the trapping, transporting, and sorting of micro-objects, imaging, and chip scale signal processing. However, the high dissipative loss and the lack of dynamical steerability restrict the implementation of Airy <b>plasmons</b> in these applications. Here we reveal the hybrid Airy <b>plasmons</b> for the first time by taking a hybrid graphene-based plasmonic waveguide in the terahertz (THz) domain as an example. Due to the coupling between an optical mode and a plasmonic mode, the hybrid Airy <b>plasmons</b> can have large propagation lengths and effective transverse deflections, where the transverse waveguide confinements are governed by the hybrid modes with moderate quality factors. Meanwhile, the propagation trajectories of hybrid Airy <b>plasmons</b> are dynamically steerable by changing the chemical potential of graphene.

40|$|<b>Plasmons</b> produce large {{confinement}} and {{enhancement of}} light that enable applications as varied as cancer therapy and catalysis. Adding to these appealing properties, graphene {{has emerged as a}} robust, electrically tunable material exhibiting <b>plasmons</b> that strongly depend on the density of doping charges. Here we show that adding a single electron to a graphene nanoisland consisting of hundreds or thousands of atoms switches on infrared <b>plasmons</b> that were previously absent from the uncharged structure. Remarkably, the addition of each further electron produces a dramatic frequency shift. <b>Plasmons</b> in these islands are shown to be tunable down to near infrared wavelengths. These phenomena are highly sensitive to carbon edges. Specifically, armchair nanotriangles display sharp <b>plasmons</b> that are associated with intense near-field enhancement, as well as absorption cross-sections exceeding the geometrical area occupied by the graphene. In contrast, zigzag triangles do not support these <b>plasmons.</b> Our conclusions rely on realistic quantum-mechanical calculations, which are in ostensible disagreement with classical electromagnetic simulations, thus revealing the quantum nature of the <b>plasmons.</b> This study shows a high sensitivity of graphene nanoislands to elementary charges, therefore emphasizing their great potential for novel nano-optoelectronics applications.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{combination}} of electromagnetism with electrons in graphene. Graphene is a one atom thick layer of carbon atoms which contains electrons that exhibit rather special properties {{in terms of their}} conduction abilities. The combination of electromagnetism with electrons gives rise to new solutions to the governing equations [...] - solutions with characteristics not quite like normal electromagnetic radiation and not quite like electrons. These solutions, which also exist in normal conductors, are hybrids between electromagnetism and matter, and are usually referred to as <b>plasmons.</b> This thesis is a theoretical study of <b>plasmons</b> in graphene. Graphene <b>plasmons</b> are investigated by calculating the conductivity of graphene, starting from a Hamiltonian describing the low-energy graphene electrons.
