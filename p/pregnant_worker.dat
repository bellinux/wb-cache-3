The UK’s withdrawal from European institutions increases the vulnerability of marginal groups and interests as layers of representation are taken away.

40|$|Sweden {{adopted a}} new {{anti-discrimination}} legislation 2009, DiskL, which aim to prevent {{direct and indirect}} discrimination in matters of employment and occupation. According to directives and practices from EU, pregnant workers are entitled a special protection from discrimination during employment situations. The purpose of this essay is to study the legal protection for pregnant workers in employment situations and also analyze whether male workers have similar protection when they plan parental leave. Both regulations from the EU-law and the Swedish law are presented and discussed. This because Swedish discrimination legislation is largely influenced by the EU-law. The study confirms that pregnant workers have a strong legal protection against discrimination through directives from the EU and DiskL. Employers must include this protection in employment situations. If hiring a <b>pregnant</b> <b>worker</b> implicates costs for employers, {{it is still not}} an accepted reason not to follow the regulation. The protection for a <b>pregnant</b> <b>worker</b> is always considered more important than an employer's financial loss, independent if the employment is fixed-term or permanent. The study also shows that male workers are protected against unfair treatment in employment situations according to 16 § föräldraledighetslagen. However, the protection of male workers is not as strong as the protection from discrimination of pregnant workers in employment situations. ...|$|E

The pregnant women were those f registered with the D. B. K. L. antenatal clinic while the non pregnant group were D. B. K. L office workers in Jalan Raja Laut. About 89. 8 % (404 respondent) out of the planned 450 respondents, participated in the study. The result showed that among the non pregnant women the prevalence of fatigue was 54. 90 / 0, that of numbness and tingling of the hands 12. 9 %, backache 22. 0 %, edema 4. 0 % and varicose veins 8. 7 %. Among the pregnant women the prevalence of fatigue was 77. 2 % (housewife) and 84. 1 % (worker), numbness and tingling of the hands was 30. 9 % (housewife) and 31. 9 % (worker), backache was 63. 8 % (housewife) and 69. 0 % (worker), leg edema was 30. 2 % (housewife) and 39. 8 % (worker) and varicose veins was 20. 4 % (worker) and 24. 2 % (housewife). Prevalence of all symptoms differed in the 3 groups except numbness and tingling of the hands (p= 0. 626). The incidence of physical changes was as followed: 30. 5 % of the numbness and tingling of the hands occured during the second trimester while 62. 5 % occured during the third trimester, for backache 36. 8 % occured during the second trimester and 57. 4 % occured in the third trimester, for leg edema 17. 8 % occure during the second trimester and 81. 1 % happened during the third trimester. The incidence of varicose vein during the second trimester was 40. 7 % and at the third trimester 39. 00 / 0. 22. 12 % of pregnant women reported reduce production as compared with non-pregnant women 14. 9 %. The prevalence of stress was significantly higher in the pregnant women (74. 4 %) compared with the non pregnant women (61. 3 %) [...] The study showed that abortion was more frequent in the working women (mean 0. 25 ± 0. 51 for <b>pregnant</b> <b>worker</b> and 0. 42 ± 0. 88 for non <b>pregnant</b> <b>worker)</b> than in the housewife (0. 17 ± 0. 45). In summary pregnancy increases the occurrence of physical signs of fatigue, numbness and tingling of the hands, backache, leg edema and varicose veins. It also increases the prevalence of stress and reduces productivity. To overcome these problems the following suggestions are made: that pregnant women- should be allowed to work flexi time, be given job adjustment when necessary, and the work place be made more conducive by having proper resting places so that pregnant women can lie down or rest their feet. It is also suggested that they should be given proper health guidelines on how to overcome the physical problems mentioned...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Revised Lifting Equation (RNLE) {{was adapted}} to derive {{recommended}} weight limits (RWLs) for <b>pregnant</b> <b>workers</b> {{and to develop}} corresponding guidelines for clinicians. BackgroundIn {{the past three decades}} there has been a large {{increase in the number of}} women employed outside the home and remaining in the workforce during pregnancy. Practical authoritative guidelines based on accumulated evidence are needed to inform allowable work activity levels for healthy <b>pregnant</b> <b>workers.</b> MethodEmpirically based lifting criteria established by NIOSH to reduce the risk of overexertion injuries in the general U. S. working population were evaluated for application to <b>pregnant</b> <b>workers.</b> Our evaluation included an extensive review of the literature linking occupational lifting to maternal and fetal health. Decision logic and supporting literature are presented, along with computational details. ResultsProvisional RWLs for <b>pregnant</b> <b>workers</b> were derived from the RNLE, along with guidelines for clinicians. The guidelines advise against <b>pregnant</b> <b>workers</b> lifting below midshin and overhead. ConclusionBased on our review of the available evidence, we present lifting thresholds that most <b>pregnant</b> <b>workers</b> with uncomplicated pregnancies should be able to perform without increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal health consequences. Except for restrictions involving lifting from the floor and overhead, the provisional guidelines presented are compatible with NIOSH lifting recommendations adopted in the early 1990 s for the general working population. ApplicationImplementation of these provisional guidelines could protect millions of female workers in the work-place from fetal and maternal lifting-related health problems.

The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA) broadly protects against pregnancy discrimination, but it provides absolute rights only to the extent a pregnant woman is able to work at full capacity, uninterrupted by pregnancy 2 ̆ 7 s physical effects. To the extent that the law grants affirmative rights to the <b>pregnant</b> <b>worker</b> with temporary physical limitations, such as the right to workplace accommodation, it is only on a comparative basis-that is, only to the extent those rights already are provided to similarly situated temporarily disabled employees. In this way, pregnancy continues to inhibit equal employment opportunity for millions of women, three decades after the PDA 2 ̆ 7 s passage. After briefly examining the medical literature documenting the conflicts between pregnancy and certain kinds of work, as well as the law as applied to pregnant workers who are fully capable or fully incapable due to the effects of pregnancy or childbirth, we consider the predicament of women in physically demanding fields whose work capacity is partially diminished by pregnancy. We focus here on the problem of access to light-duty work-temporary alternative job assignments that accommodate the <b>pregnant</b> <b>worker</b> 2 ̆ 7 s limitations. Without such accommodation, the pregnant firefighter or home health care aide whose doctor directs her to avoid heavy lifting or other tasks is faced with a Hobson 2 ̆ 7 s choice: ignore medical advice and continue to perform all job duties, or stop working altogether, usually sacrificing wages and other benefits for several months.

These include reframing the 2 ̆ 2 similarly situated 2 ̆ 2 analysis for disparate treatment challenges to light-duty policies, and exploring the untapped potential of the disparate impact theory in the light-duty context...|$|E

Assuming a two percent pregnancy rate and 50 million women of childbearing age, nearly 1 million working women may be pregnant at one time. With such a large number of employees who may become pregnant, it is important to understand how pregnancy can impact workplace safety. Often, discussion of risks related to pregnancy focuses on chemical exposure. However, ergonomic concerns exist as well. For example, pregnancy can affect reach distance, balance and lifting tasks; it can also aggravate the effects of repetitive motion. Some research also suggests a link between certain ergonomic stressors and adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion, pre-term delivery and low birthweight (AMWA). Several studies have found an increased risk of pre-term delivery among women whose jobs involve a combination of stressful factors, such as standing for long durations, repetitive lifting and working long hours (Henriksen 198 +, Mamelle 309 +).

40|$|Protective Maternity Legislation (PML) for {{pregnant}} workers {{is well established}} in Italy and France, but {{little is known about}} the way it fulfils some of its aims, such as the protection of mothers' and babies' health and of the rights of women workers. In this paper, we present the results of two surveys, one carried out in Italy and the other in France, concerned with the implementation of these regulations. Results show that women who were regularly employed generally could benefit from PML, while non-eligible workers, most of them holding manual jobs, were not protected at all. Among eligible workers, inequalities existed: women with less qualified jobs and those employed in the private sector were less likely to benefit from the protective measures considered. A number of specific measures, such as the possibility of taking an early maternity leave for work reasons and of being moved to another job within the same firm were underused in both countries.

40|$|European Union (EU) Directives on {{maternity}} leave, namely Directive 92 / 85, on {{the protection}} of pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth {{and women who are}} breastfeeding, and Directive 2010 / 41, on equal treatment men-women in self-employment activities, adopt a single-social risk approach since they justify maternity leave in the vulnerability of the delivering mother and protect her incapacity to work by providing an exclusive leave of at least 14 weeks. Some recent case law of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) seems to suggest that maternity leave regulated by EU Directives is not consistent with the single-social risk approach and is clashing with the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of gender. With regard to the latter, account must be taken of Directive 2006 / 54 (which replaces Directive 76 / 207), on equal treatment men-women in matters of employment, and Directive 79 / 7 /EEC, on equal treatment in matters of (statutory) social security, which set out that provisions concerning {{the protection of}} women, particularly as regards pregnancy and maternity, whose epitome is maternity leave, are not contrary to the principle of equal treatment. Cases Roca Álvarez and Betriu Montull showed the clash mentioned above. Whereas in the first case, the Court stated that setting up different requirements for women and men in Spanish breastfeeding leave regulation was discriminatory against men, since “the positions of a male and a female worker […] are comparable […] in order to look after their child”, in the second case the Court followed a different reasoning in a dispute about Spanish maternity leave regulation, which sets up different requirements for women and men with regard to the second period of maternity leave (10 weeks after the women’s 6 weeks after-birth compulsory period). Advocate General considered Betriu Montull case similar to the Roca Álvarez one and accordingly concluded that Spanish Law was discriminatory against men. He argued that, “unlike the 6 weeks of leave immediately following the birth, with a view to protecting her (the mother’s) biological condition”, “the 10 weeks’ leave […] is accorded to workers solely in their capacity as parents of the child”. Contrary to Advocate General’s opinion, the Court considered, as in 1983 Hofmann case, that the whole period of maternity leave (including the 10 week’s leave) is within the protection of women, particularly as regards pregnancy and maternity, and therefore not contrary to the principle of equal treatment. Precisely in Hofmann case, the CJEU also maintained that maternity leave had two functions: the protection of the biological condition of the mother and the protection of the “special relationship between a woman and her child over the period which follows pregnancy and childbirth”. This case law about this twofold function has been continuously repeated until today. Cases CD and Z showed that current maternity leave regulated by EU Directives may not be consistent with its own objective (the protection of the incapacity to work of the delivering mother). In both cases the question was whether, in case of surrogate motherhood, a commissioning mother had the right to maternity leave regulated in Directive 92 / 85. The respective Advocates General delivered different opinions. In case CD, the Advocate General defended that “the Directive must be understood in functional rather than monistic biological terms”. She argued that “the surrogate mother who carries the child but who does not care for it after the birth requires protection only as a <b>pregnant</b> <b>worker</b> or woman who has recently given birth. In the case of the intended mother, who was not pregnant herself but has an infant in her care and, possibly, also breastfeeds it, {{there is a need for}} protection after the birth of the child”. Contrary to that opinion, the Advocate General in case Z defended a monistic biological approach. He believed that the objective of protecting “the special relationship that develops after birth between the woman and her child […] can only be understood in context; as a logical corollary of childbirth (and breastfeeding). Otherwise, if that objective were given independent significance, the scope of protection afforded by […] Directive 92 / 85 could not, in my view, be meaningfully limited only to women who have given birth, but would necessarily also cover adoptive mothers or indeed, any other parent who takes full care of his or her new-born child”. Finally, both judgments followed the monistic biological approach and declared that a commissioning mother does not have the right to maternity leave regulated in Directive 92 / 85. These four judgements triggered a fundamental question: are EU Directives on maternity leave putting too much emphasis on the incapacity to work of the delivering mother and therefore overlooking the care of the new-born? If so, three problems arise. The first one is that there may be a deficient protection of the new-born when the delivering mother for any reason is not taking care of him or her insofar as other potential carers are being excluded, such as her partner or a commissioning parent. The second and third problems have to do with the perpetuation of the traditional distribution of roles between men and women in relation to the care of the new-born EU Directives on maternity leave and CJEU case law seem to be contributing to. First, such distribution of roles can have detrimental effects for women in the labour market. Second, there may be problems of discrimination against fathers with regard to the care period of maternity leave. The state of the art shows there are two existing gaps in the legal body of literature this research aims to cover. The first one concerns the social risks question, given that up to date the twofold function of maternity leave and the possible consequences on the protection of the new-born have not been sufficiently studied. The second gap relates to the lack of attention given to the possible discrimination against men. Besides, a multidisciplinary approach, which combines legal aspects, such as social risks protection and gender discrimination, with evidence based on medical and economic science, is missing. The aim of this research is to know to what extent a multi-social risk approach should be adopted, defined as that in which both the protection of the incapacity to work of the delivering mother and the care of the new-born are taken into account. To answer this normative question, a framework will be built using different inputs, which include not only legal sources but also medical and economic studies. First of all, medical literature will be reviewed in order to study how long the protection for the delivering mother should be, i. e. how many weeks a mother is unable to work during pregnancy and after birth. Secondly, our attention will focus on to what extent a distinction is made between the two social risks in a selection of Member States of the EU. Trying to get represented all MOSS’ approaches to maternity leave policy, the countries to be included are: Belgium and Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom, and Sweden and Portugal. Thirdly, economic literature will be examined to assess what kind of relationship there is between maternity leaves taken up by the mother and her labour chances afterwards. I will review economic studies to assess RAY & others’ scenarios and see to what extent maternity leave can influence women’s labour market outcomes in terms of participation and wage levels in a positive way (gender-equalising employment effects), in a negative way (non-gender-equalising employment effects) or in a mixed way (depending on the duration of child-related leaves). Finally, we will look at the current status of case law of the CJEU and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in relation to the discrimination against men and maternity leaves. Special focus will be put on the possible clash between Directive 92 / 85 and Directive 2006 / 54, as well as between the different provisions of Directive 2010 / 41, namely the general equal treatment provision and the specific maternity allowance provision. Great attention will be paid to the possibilities to overcome that clash at constitutional level, especially after the CJEU in its judgement in the case Test-Achats declared that Directive 2004 / 113, a Directive on equal treatment, was incompatible with articles 21 and 23 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. Medical literature will be reviewed to find out whether there are possible differences between the ability of mothers and fathers to take care of the new-born to see whether a difference of treatment can be justified by a better ability of mothers to take care of the new-born, for instance by means of breastfeeding. status: publishe...|$|E

Next, the defendant may rebut the plaintiff’s accusations by providing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its perceived discrimination.

40|$|In {{deciding}} Young v. United Parcel Service, the Supreme Court has {{intervened in}} ongoing struggles about when {{and whether the}} Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA) requires the accommodation of <b>pregnant</b> <b>workers.</b> Drawing on original archival research, this Article historicizes Young, arguing that the PDA embodied a limited principle of what the Article calls meaningful reproductive choice. Feminist litigators first forged such an idea in the early 1970 s, arguing that heightened judicial scrutiny should apply whenever state actors placed special burdens on women who chose childbirth or abortion. A line of Supreme Court decisions completely rejected this understanding of reproductive liberty. However, choice arguments rejected in the juridical arena flourished in Congress, during debate about the PDA. For a variety of strategic and ideological reasons, legal feminists and antiabortion activists turned to legislative constitutionalism to give meaning {{to the idea of}} reproductive liberty. While not requiring employers to provide any accommodations, the PDA prohibited employers from placing special burdens on women’s procreative decisions. The history of the meaningful-choice principle suggests that while the Court reached the right outcome, Young still falls short of providing women the protection intended by the framers of the PDA. By a 6 - 3 vote, the Court vacated a Fourth Circuit decision vindicating United Parcel Service’s “pregnancy-blind” employment policy—that is, the policy effectively excluded <b>pregnant</b> <b>workers</b> but did not formally categorize them on the basis of pregnancy. In its application of the McDonnell-Douglas burden-shifting analysis, Young removed some of the obstacles previously faced by <b>pregnant</b> <b>workers</b> relying on disparate treatment theories. However, the Court still assumes that employers could have legitimate reasons for discriminating against <b>pregnant</b> <b>workers</b> beyond their ability to do a job, creating precisely the kind of burdens on reproductive decision-making that the PDA was supposed to eliminate. The history of the meaningful-choice principle strengthens the arguments against pregnancy-blind policies that are available after Young, including disparate treatment, disparate impact, and disability accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Ultimately, however, the history studied here shows that the promise of litigation after Young may well still be limited. Legislation, rather than litigation, may be the most promising path for expanding protections for pregnant women...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{expansion}} of the Americans with Disabilities Act’s (ADA) protected class invites reexamination of the assumption that <b>pregnant</b> <b>workers</b> may not use the ADA to obtain workplace accommodations. The ADA’s scope now includes persons with minor temporary physical limitations comparable to pregnancy’s physical effects. Accordingly, the primary remaining justification for concluding that <b>pregnant</b> <b>workers</b> may not obtain ADA accommodations is that pregnancy is a physically healthy condition rather than a physiological defect. Drawing on the social model of disability, this Article challenges the assumption that medical diagnosis of “defect” must be a prerequisite to disability accommodation eligibility. The social model defines “disability” not as an impairment located within an individual’s body but as {{the interaction between the}} individual’s body and her social environment. Within this framework, workers may experience pregnancy, a healthy biological state, as a workplace “disability. ” Accordingly, now that workers with temporary physical limitations comparable to pregnancy may receive ADA accommodations, courts should conclude that the ADA’s goal—to reshape the workplace to accommodate previously excluded persons—extends to pregnancy...|$|R

Painter introduced the Pennsylvania <b>Pregnant</b> <b>Workers</b> Fairness Act to prohibit workplace discrimination against pregnant women and women with newborn children and proposed two amendments that would add protections to the Landlord and Tenant Act for tenants who are victims of domestic violence.

The Article describes how labor unions pushed for the passage of the Act and later made protections for <b>pregnant</b> <b>workers</b> real through collective bargaining, internal education efforts, and litigation. Finally, the Article discusses the fundamental improvements for working women that still must be achieved and the need for strengthened worker organizations if those changes are to become a realit...|$|R
