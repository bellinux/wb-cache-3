25|$|A <b>plantar</b> <b>wart</b> is a wart {{occurring}} on {{the bottom}} of the foot or toes. They are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV infections in other locations are not plantar warts.|$|E
25|$|A <b>plantar</b> <b>wart</b> {{is a small}} lesion {{that appears}} {{on the surface of}} the skin and {{typically}} resembles a cauliflower, with tiny black petechiae (tiny hemorrhages under the skin) in the center. Pinpoint bleeding may occur when these are scratched. Plantar warts occur on the soles of feet and toes. They may be painful when standing or walking.|$|E
25|$|Plantar warts {{are often}} similar to calluses or corns, {{but can be}} {{differentiated}} by close observation of skin striations. Feet are covered in skin striae, which are akin to fingerprints on the feet. Skin striae go around plantar warts; if the lesion is not a <b>plantar</b> <b>wart,</b> the striations continue across {{the top layer of}} the skin. Plantar warts tend to be painful on application of pressure from either side of the lesion rather than direct pressure, unlike calluses (which tend to be painful on direct pressure instead).|$|E
40|$|Background: Treatment of <b>plantar</b> <b>warts</b> {{caused by}} human {{papilloma}} virus (HPV) strain types 1, 2 and 4 {{is often difficult}} and a challenging problem. Various therapeutic modalities available for treating this problem have not been uniformly successful. Purpose : The purpose of present study is to evaluate the efficacy of adapalene applied locally with occlusion in <b>plantar</b> <b>warts.</b> Materials and Methods: A total of 10 patient with 118 <b>plantar</b> <b>warts</b> were included in an open study. All were treated by applying adapalene gel 0. 1 % after paring of warts if needed followed by occlusive dressing with polythene paper in each patient. The effects of the treatment were evaluated every week till the clearance of all warts. Findings: Adapalene was used in 10 patient having 118 <b>plantar</b> <b>warts.</b> All the warts cleared in 39 ± 15. 07 days. There was no side effects like scar formation, irritation, erythema or infection with adapalene. Conclusion: Adapalene clears the <b>plantar</b> <b>warts</b> faster compared to other modalities available. Limitation: Need trial with large number of patients...|$|R
25|$|<b>Plantar</b> <b>warts</b> are not {{prevented}} by inoculation with currently available HPV vaccines because the warts {{are caused by}} different strains of HPV. Gardasil protects against strains 6, 11, 16, and 18, and Cervarix protects against 16 and 18, whereas <b>plantar</b> <b>warts</b> are caused by strains 1, 2, 4, and 63.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cryotherapy is {{effective}} for common <b>warts,</b> but for <b>plantar</b> <b>warts</b> available treatments often fail. OBJECTIVES: Within a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, we examined whether subgroups of common and <b>plantar</b> <b>warts</b> have a favourable natural course or response to treatment based on wart-associated HPV type. STUDY DESIGN: Consecutive patients with new common or <b>plantar</b> <b>warts</b> were recruited in 30 Dutch family practices. Patients (n= 250) were randomly allocated to liquid-nitrogen cryotherapy, 40 % salicylic acid self-application, or wait-and-see policy. Before treatment, swabs {{were taken from}} all separate warts and analysed by a broad spectrum HPV genotyping assay. At 13 weeks, cure rates with 95 % confidence intervals of common and <b>plantar</b> <b>warts</b> on intention to treat basis were compared between treatment arms for the different wart-associated HPV types. RESULTS: In total, 7 % of swabs tested negative for HPV DNA and 16 % contained multiple types, leaving 278 of 371 common swabs (75 %) and 299 of 373 plantar swabs (80 %) with a single type for analysis. After wait-and-see policy, cure rates were 2 / 70 (3 %, 95 % confidence interval 1 - 10) for HPV 2 / 27 / 57 -associated common warts, 4 / 58 (7 %, 3 - 16) for HPV 2 / 27 / 57 -associated <b>plantar</b> <b>warts,</b> and 21 / 36 (58 %, 42 - 73) for HPV 1 -associated <b>plantar</b> <b>warts.</b> After cryotherapy, cure rates were 30 / 44 (68 %, 53 - 80), 6 / 56 (11 %, 5 - 21), and 15 / 23 (65 %, 45 - 81); after salicylic acid 16 / 87 (18 %, 12 - 28), 15 / 60 (25 %, 16 - 37), and 24 / 26 (92 %, 76 - 98), respectively.

25|$|Plantar warts are benign {{epithelial}} tumors generally {{caused by}} infection by human papilloma virus types 1, 2, 4, 60, or 63, but {{have also been}} caused by types 57, 65, 66, and 156. These types are classified as clinical (visible symptoms). The virus attacks compromised skin through direct contact, entering through possibly tiny cuts and abrasions in the stratum corneum (outermost layer of skin). After infection, warts may not become visible for several weeks or months. Because {{of pressure on the}} sole of the foot or finger, the wart is pushed inward and a layer of hard skin may form over the wart. A <b>plantar</b> <b>wart</b> can be painful if left untreated.|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose. Verrucae, or warts, are common, {{contagious}} epidermal tumors {{that plague}} many individuals. They {{are caused by}} the human papillomavirus (HPV) that often enters the skin through small cuts and abrasions. Our research focused on warts found on the sole of the foot, known as <b>plantar</b> <b>warts.</b> Most <b>plantar</b> <b>warts</b> are benign, but can be rather painful since they reside on a weight-bearing surface. After time, they may begin to interfere with daily activities and if left untreated can grow and spread. There are numerous treatment options available, however, results tend to be inconsistent and the warts often return. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the efficacy of 3 MHz ultrasound (US) for the treatment of <b>plantar</b> <b>warts.</b> Methods. Eleven subjects were randomly assigned into a treatment or placebo-controlled group. All subjects had a diagnosis of plantar verrucae confirmed by a physician. Each subject received a series of six US treatments spread over a two-week period. Results. Primarily due to the small sample, there was not a statistically significant difference in cure rate between treatment and placebo groups. Conclusion and Discussion. Statistical significance was not found in this study due to small sample size, however, the data suggests ultrasound to be a successful option in the treatment of <b>plantar</b> <b>warts.</b> Further studies should be conducted with a greater number of subjects and various settings to determine the effectiveness and parameters for the course of treatment...|$|R

Participants 240 patients aged 12 years and over, with a <b>plantar</b> <b>wart</b> that in the opinion of the healthcare professional was suitable for treatment with both cryotherapy and salicylic acid. Interventions Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen delivered by a healthcare professional, up to four treatments two to three weeks apart. Patient self treatment with 50 % salicylic acid (Verrugon) daily up to a maximum of eight weeks. Main outcome measures Complete clearance of all plantar warts at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were (a) complete clearance of all plantar warts at 12 weeks controlling for age, whether the wart had been treated previously, and type of wart, (b) patient self reported clearance of plantar warts at six months, (c) time to clearance of <b>plantar</b> <b>wart,</b> (d) number of plantar warts at 12 weeks, and (e) patient satisfaction with the treatment. Results There was no evidence of a difference between the salicylic acid and cryotherapy groups in the proportions of participants with complete clearance of all plantar warts at 12 weeks (17 / 119 (14 %) v 15 / 110 (14 %), difference 0. 65 % (95 % CI Â¿ 8. 33 to 9. 63), P= 0. 89). The results did not change when the analysis was repeated but with adjustment for age, whether the wart had been treated previously, and type of <b>plantar</b> <b>wart</b> or for patientsÂ¿ preferences at baseline. There was no evidence of a difference between the salicylic acid and cryotherapy groups in self reported clearance of plantar warts at six months (29 / 95 (31 %) v 33 / 98 (34 %), difference Â¿ 3. 15 % (Â¿ 16. 31 to 10. 02), P= 0. 64) or in time to clearance (hazard ratio 0. 80 (95 % CI 0. 51 to 1. 25), P= 0. 33).
