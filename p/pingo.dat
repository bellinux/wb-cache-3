50|$|<b>Pingos</b> are {{generally}} classified as hydrostatic (closed-system) or hydraulic (open-system). Relict hydrostatic (closed-system) and hydraulic (open-system) <b>pingos</b> may {{be distinguished from}} each other by determining whether lacustrine (lake) deposits {{are associated with the}} formation. <b>Pingos</b> in northern Alaska and northwestern Canada have been found to form in two different environments. <b>Pingos</b> that form on slopes are usually small, irregularly shaped, and fractured at the top. These usually form because of sub-surface hydraulic pressure. <b>Pingos</b> in these areas also form in the more common way, on flat ground in old lake basins when the water is too shallow to prevent permafrost. These structures tend to be much larger than the <b>pingos</b> that form on slopes.|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} nine <b>pingos</b> {{occurs in the}} valley of a glacial meltwater river. The <b>pingos</b> rise from a plain of low-center polygons. Some <b>pingos</b> have a typical cone shape, but others are linear, {{apparently}} centered on ice wedges. The occurrence of most <b>pingos</b> at the junction of oversize ice wedge polygon ridges suggests that the injection of water and the segregation of ice occurred along pathways provided by the ice wedges...|$|R

50|$|His sons Lewis <b>Pingo</b> (1743-1830) and John <b>Pingo</b> {{also became}} noted medallists, Lewis {{succeeding}} {{his father as}} the Mint's Assistant Engraver in 1776.

50|$|Kadleroshilik <b>Pingo</b> (or Kadleroshilik Mound) is a <b>pingo</b> {{located about}} 40 km {{southeast}} of Prudhoe Bay in the U.S. state of Alaska. Rising to {{an elevation of}} 178 ft above the surrounding lake plain, it is the highest known <b>pingo</b> in the world.|$|E

50|$|Palsas are {{structurally}} {{similar to}} <b>pingos,</b> however with heights between approx. 0.5 and 2 m and lengths between approx. 5 and 25 m, palsas are significantly smaller than <b>pingos.</b> Both however {{are considered to}} be true perennial permafrost mounds since both occur in areas of continuous permafrost. Moreover, contrary to <b>pingos</b> which are usually isolated, palsas usually arise in groups with other palsas, such as in a so-called palsa bog. Unlike <b>pingos,</b> palsas do not require surrounding permafrost to grow, seeing as palsa are permafrost. <b>Pingos</b> also grow below the active layer, which is the depth that the annual freeze-thaw cycle occurs, and palsa grow in the active layer.|$|R

50|$|Thomas <b>Pingo</b> (1714-1776) was an English medallist and die engraver. He {{worked for}} the Royal Mint in London.

50|$|A palsa is a low, often oval, {{frost heave}} {{occurring}} in polar and subpolar climates, which contain permanently frozen ice lenses. Like <b>pingos,</b> palsas consist of an ice core with overlying soil, {{but they are}} generally smaller than <b>pingos,</b> often occur in groups and may develop from ground water without additional hydrostatic pressure. Palsas are characteristically found in areas with discontinuous permafrost, and in such areas {{they may be the}} only reliable surface evidence of permafrost. Surface water, found in bogs, enhances palsa formation in areas called palsa bogs.|$|R
