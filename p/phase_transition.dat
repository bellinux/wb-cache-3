50|$|<b>Phase</b> <b>transitions</b> {{occur when}} the {{thermodynamic}} free energy of a system is non-analytic for some choice of thermodynamic variables (cf. phases).

It is important to note that <b>phase</b> <b>transitions</b> can occur and are defined for non-thermodynamic systems, where temperature is not a parameter. Examples include: quantum <b>phase</b> <b>transitions,</b> dynamic <b>phase</b> <b>transitions,</b> and topological (structural) <b>phase</b> <b>transitions.</b> In these types of systems other parameters take the place of temperature.

40|$|There {{are only}} two ways for {{solid-state}} <b>phase</b> <b>transitions</b> {{to be compliant with}} thermodynamics: emerging of infinitesimal quantity of the new phase, or infinitesimal "qualitative" change occurring uniformly throughout the bulk at a time.

While introducing the theory of "continuous" second-order <b>phase</b> <b>transitions,</b> L.
