Detection {{was done by}} using an integrated <b>piezoresistive</b> <b>gauge</b> in top and bottom electrodes. Some piezoresistive gauges were integrated in a Wheatstone bridge to improve the sensitivity. Devices with direct measurement gauge were also realized. Piezoresistive responses were compared with an optical measurement by a light interferometer. By poling the PZT between − 5 V and 5 V, the ferroelectric cycle was observed with both optical and piezoresistive detections. The two measurements are fitting.

The a-C:H films were deposited at - 350 V bias voltage on silicon (Si) substrates using plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition (PACVD). Current–voltage characteristics of a-C:H/n-Si heterojunctions show ohmic behavior within operating voltages of ± 1 V. In the higher voltage range the Frenkel–Poole mechanism is dominant. Conduction is thermally activated at temperatures ranging from 23 °C to 150 °C. The activation energy amounts to 0. 48 eV.
