5|$|In March 2010, the <b>port</b> <b>authorities</b> of Trieste, Ravenna, Venice and Koper {{established}} the North Adriatic Ports Association (NAPA) in Trieste {{with the aim}} of enhancing the position of the ports in the European Union and its transport patterns. The Port of Rijeka joined the NAPA in November 2010. The NAPA aims to harmonize information systems and organizational setup of the member ports in order to attract shipping. The project was scheduled to be completed by 2013. Besides the NAPA, the Port of Rijeka {{is also a member of}} the EcoPorts network of the European Sea Ports Organisation, the International Harbour Masters' Association, Association Internationale Villes et Ports, the Croatian Association of <b>Port</b> <b>Authorities</b> and the International Association of Ports and Harbors.|$|E

5|$|The three {{ships were}} the Italian 8,500-ton {{merchant}} vessel Duchessa d'Aosta, the second a large German tug Likomba, the third a diesel-powered barge Bibundi. Duchessa d'Aosta had a working radio which {{was considered a}} threat, {{with the potential to}} provide details of Allied naval movements. Her declared cargo was 3 million pounds of wool, 316,610 pounds of hides and skins, 1.3 million pounds of tanning materials, 4 million pounds of copra, 544,660 pounds of crude asbestos fibre and over 1.1 million ingots of electrolytic copper. The first page of the ship's cargo manifest, was not presented to the <b>port</b> <b>authorities</b> and the ship's captain refused to provide them with any details, which led to speculation it was also carrying arms or ammunition. In his visits to the island, SOE agent Leonard Guise kept the ships under observation, and in August 1941 submitted a plan to seize Likomba and disable Duchessa d'Aosta. Approval for the military operation in a neutral port was given by the Admiralty on 20 November 1941.|$|E

After 1900 the <b>port</b> <b>authorities</b> built new modern docks to the east of the former Leith docks, and the Caledonian further extended its Leith line to reach the new facilities: the Leith New Lines opened in 1903. It had been planned to open a passenger service on the line, and passenger stations had been built, but street tramcar competition made it clear that an inner suburban passenger railway was unviable and the passenger service was never inaugurated.|$|E

25|$|In November 1975 {{an attempt}} was made to sink the ship. While she was being {{repaired}} at San Juan, two bombs were installed on board under the waterline. These were detonated later during the same month as the ship was approaching New York. The damage did not sink the ship however, and she was subsequently repaired at the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in Hoboken, New Jersey, United States. An incident of a different nature took place while the ship was inbound to New York on 18 September 1980, when the <b>port</b> <b>authorities</b> declined the ship's right to make port due to the Soviet Union's involvement in Afghanistan at the time. Instead of entering port Maxim Gorky was forced to lay at anchor outside Staten Island, while port ferries were used to bring her passengers to the city.|$|E
25|$|The Dingwall & Skye Railway {{purchased}} two steamers, Jura and Oscar, {{to operate}} the services to Portree and Stornoway. Initially a daily service was provided to Portee, and a weekly service to Stornoway, but the first winter {{the frequency of the}} Portee service was reduced and the Stornoway service suspended. Oscar ran around in November 1870, to be replaced with Carham and a new ship, named Ferret, was purchased to replace Jura. It was found that most of the work could be carried out with Carham, and Ferret was offered for charter. A three-month lease was agreed and paid for, but the ship went missing. It was discovered later in Melbourne, Australia, when offered for sale under an assumed name that the <b>port</b> <b>authorities</b> could not identify in the records. The company withdrew in favour of MacBrayne's running the service in 1880.|$|E
25|$|Flags are {{particularly}} important at sea, where they {{can mean the difference}} between life and death, and consequently where the rules and regulations for the flying of flags are strictly enforced. A national flag flown at sea is known as an ensign. A courteous, peaceable merchant ship or yacht customarily flies its ensign (in the usual ensign position), together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast (known as a courtesy flag). To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or in the face of a foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with cannon, for the right to do so. As of 2009, this custom is still taken seriously by many naval and <b>port</b> <b>authorities</b> and is readily enforced in many parts of the world by boarding, confiscation and other civil penalties.|$|E

25|$|Captain Schettino {{participated in}} three {{telephone}} calls with the cruise line's crisis management officer. At 22:26, Schettino told the Port of Livorno's harbour master {{that the ship}} had taken water through {{an opening in the}} port side and requested a tug boat. <b>Port</b> <b>authorities</b> were not alerted to the collision until 22:42, about an hour after the impact, and the order to evacuate the ship was not given until 22:50. Some passengers jumped into the water to swim to shore, while others, ready to evacuate the vessel, were delayed by crew members up to 45 minutes, as they resisted immediately lowering the lifeboats. Some sources report that the ship did not list until 23:15 and therefore if Schettino had given the order to abandon ship, the lifeboats could have been launched earlier, allowing the passengers to reach safety. In contrast, one expert stated that a delay might be justified considering the hazards in launching lifeboats while a ship is still moving.|$|E
