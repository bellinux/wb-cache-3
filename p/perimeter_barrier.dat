40|$|The {{move towards}} multi-faceted {{approaches}} to flood risk management is cemented in the European Union (EU) Floods Directive (Directive 2007 / 60 /EC). Across Europe, resources are diverted towards softer interventions such as using the planning system to control developments in flood risk areas, and citizens {{are encouraged to}} live with floods. Damage mitigation nevertheless remains important and a market has therefore been developing for technologies that help to manage flood risk at the receptor scale, such as door and window guards and <b>perimeter</b> <b>barriers.</b> However, little empirical research has been undertaken that analyses how such technologies might fit with holistic flood risk management strategies. This paper reports on a multidisciplinary research project which investigated, developed and tested innovative technologies to protect buildings and urban infrastructure from floods.

30|$|Many ant {{species are}} serious pests in urban environments. They may cause damage to structures, {{electronic}} devices and affect household residents; in addition, many species can sting and/or bite. Presently there is {{greater awareness of}} the risks involved in the indiscriminate release of toxicants on the environments we live and work, thus the demand for environmentally friendly control methods is growing. For ant control in urban settings, insecticides have been commonly used as <b>perimeter</b> <b>barrier</b> treatments (Mallis 1969; Ebeling 1978; Hedges 2010; Klotz et al. 2010). However, fast-acting barriers or sprays may result in ants trapped within the building in treatment (Klotz et al. 20082010) or in colony budding (Hedges 2010; Buczkowski et al. 2005; Oi 2008), even increasing the foraging activity indoors (Oi et al. 1996). The use of toxic baits is, undoubtedly, the least polluting way to control these insects and {{it is easy to}} be commercialized and applied both in homes and buildings. Exterior application of a delayed-action toxicant could result in successful control for indoor ant infestations (Oi et al. 1996).|$|E

40|$|Since {{the horrific}} attacks on September 11 th 2001, the United States {{government}} and research community have {{been focused on}} how to better protect US assets across the Globe. This push for safety led the research community to develop ?F 2656 - 07 Standard Test Method for Vehicle Crash Testing of <b>Perimeter</b> <b>Barriers?</b> in 2007 which standardized the method of validating a <b>perimeter</b> security <b>barrier?s</b> ability to withstand an impact from an attacking vehicle. Many of these security barriers rely on weak cohesionless soils to stop attacking vehicles. Designers currently rely heavily on hand calculations and engineering judgment when sizing these installations. This simplified analysis is generally used because of the complex nature of these soils under impact. These soils could be simulated in advanced finite element simulations; however, traditional modeling techniques will not allow for the simulation of these complex behaviors. Due to the complex nature of these simulations, new modeling techniques need to be evaluated and their use needed to be perfected. From this, a new method for creating a predictive simulation of a low speed impactor into a weak cohesionless soil was generated. This paper presents {{the development of a}} method by which a predictive simulation was created using only standard soil tests parameters. This paper also presents measured data from physical impact tests utilized to validate the method by which the simulation was generated. Next, the paper gives a detailed comparison {{of the results of the}} physical testing and the simulated impacts. The paper finally gives a summary of where the method is successful and where it needs improvement. The resulting methodology developed in this paper defines a reasonable process for creating a predictive simulation of a rigid impactor penetrating weak cohesionless sands. This finding is validated by a reasonable correlation between the measured and simulated impact penetrations. This paper also highlights the high variability of measured penetrations when testing with these soil materials...|$|R
40|$|<b>Perimeter</b> {{security}} cable <b>barriers</b> {{are widely}} used by various government agencies {{all over the world}} to defeat threat vehicle penetration. Any new barrier design requires validation prior to implementation. Full-scale vehicular crash tests for validations are costly, while validation through finite element (FE) crash simulations are time consuming and requires specialized skills. Based on full-scale crash tests, an innovative and simple algorithm has been developed in this research to model the progressive failure of <b>perimeter</b> security cable <b>barrier.</b> ^ A different approach from the conventional FE method was developed in an attempt to reduce computer runtime. The entire event is divided into small time-steps of 0. 5 milliseconds or less. Vehicle is modeled as an assembly of three-dimensional (3 D) rigid and deformable parts made of solid and shell elements, connected by inelastic truss members. Stiffness of solid and shell elements are ignored. Nonlinear structural responses due to the inelastic material effect and large deformation of these truss members were taken into account. A method was developed to compute inertial tensors from vehicle solid elements and cargo loads. A 3 D contact algorithm was developed to identify contacts between multiple faces and multiple vertices of multiple bodies. For a cable barrier, a 3 D vehicle model interacts with a 3 D cable barrier model during a time step, resulting in deformation of the cables and contact forces. In order to have an efficient simulation, only the predominant failure modes observed in the crash tests are modeled. Elasto-plastic deformation of cables, posts and vehicle are considered in the algorithm. For a particular crash scenario with known anchor parameters, a method was developed to estimate the energy dissipated in the post-soil interaction based on standard empirical equations, available crash tests and published literatures. Estimated energy dissipated is then included in each time step during the simulation. ^ The simulation model developed has been validated against three <b>perimeter</b> security cable <b>barrier</b> crash tests. This user-friendly cable barrier model, displaying simulation results graphically, can be used to provide realistic parameters for a <b>perimeter</b> security cable <b>barrier</b> design within less than 10 minutes of simulation runtime. ...|$|R
40|$|It is over 30 {{years since}} {{the release of the}} {{findings}} of the Nagle Royal Commission. The findings constituted a watershed in Australian penal history and signified the beginning of a period of significant reform in Australian prisons. Flowing on from the Nagle Royal Commission, a number of Australian prison systems became the subject of official inquiries into allegations of systemic abuse of prisoners and the conditions of confinement. As a result the governments of Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory embarked upon comprehensive building programs to replace older prisons and to implement modern programs in prison management. Other states and territories followed suit at later times. There has been a paucity of research into the development of prison design in Australia. This paper will discuss the various architectural innovations which were introduced post Nagle which transformed Australian prison environments. The early post Nagle innovations tended to be uncritical emulations of the latest overseas concepts, and this paper will discuss the introduction of unit management, secure <b>perimeter</b> <b>barriers,</b> campus planning and podular design to Australian prisons. Innovations outside the ‘one size fits all’ approach were later developed by prison designers for the Australian context. Innovations include safe cell technologies, ‘women specific’ approaches, the use of cottage style accommodation, developments in the design of gatehouses and specific facilities for Aboriginal prisoners by various correctional jurisdictions. The paper notes that while there have been some remarkable advances in Australian prison architecture in the last thirty years there remain major challenges for the production of prison environments which do the least harm to those who are securely housed within them.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a summary {{introduction to the}} emerging area of Architectural Surety{trademark} applications for buildings and infrastructures that are subjected to dynamic loads from blast and naturally occurring events. This technology area has been under investigation {{to assist with the}} definition of risks associated with dynamic loads and to provide guidance for determining the required upgrading and retrofitting techniques suggested for reducing building and infrastructure vulnerabilities to such dynamic forces. This unique approach involves the application of risk management techniques for solving problems of the as-built environment through the application of security, safety, and reliability principles developed in the nuclear weapons programs of the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and through the protective structures programs of the German Ministry of Defense (MOD). The changing responsibilities of engineering design professionals are addressed in light of the increased public awareness of structural and facility systems' vulnerabilities to malevolent, normal, and abnormal environment conditions. Brief discussions are also presented on (1) the need to understand how dynamic pressures are affected by the structural failures they cause, (2) the need to determine cladding effects on columns, walls, and slabs, and (3) the need to establish effective standoff distance for <b>perimeter</b> <b>barriers.</b> A summary description is presented of selected technologies to upgrade and retrofit buildings by using high-strength concrete and energy-absorbing materials and by specifying appropriately designed window glazing and special masonry wall configurations and composites.

40|$|Anti ram <b>perimeter</b> <b>barriers</b> {{are part}} of the {{protection}} of important facilities such as power plants, air ports and embassies against unrestricted vehicle access. Many different systems can be used to achieve the containment goal. One of these systems makes use of soil embedded posts either single posts if the soil is hard enough or groups of soil embedded posts tied together by beams if the soil is not hard enough for a single post to stop the in-coming truck. The design of these soil embedded posts needs to take account a number of influencing factors which include the soil strength and stiffness, the post strength and stiffness, the mass of the vehicle and its approach velocity. This dissertation describes the work done to develop a set of design recommendations to select the embedment of a single post or group of posts. The post is a steel beam with an H shape cross section: W 14 X 109 for the single post system and W 14 X 90 for the group system with a double beam made of square hollow steel section HSS 8 X 8 X 1 / 2. The spacing of the posts for the group includes 2. 44 m, 4. 88 m, and 7. 32 m. The soil strength varies from loose sand and soft clay to very dense sand and very hard clay. The vehicle has a mass of 6800 kg and the velocities include 80 km/h, 65 km/h, and 50 km/h. The design guidelines presented here are based on 10 medium scale pendulum impact tests, 2 medium scale bogie impact tests, 1 full scale impact test on a single post, 1 full scale impact test on a group of 8 side by side posts with a 5. 2 m spacing and connected with two beams, approximately 150 4 -D numerical simulations of full scale impact tests using LS-DYNA, as well as fundamental theoretical concepts...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of floor-to-floor fire spread at the exterior walls {{have been established}} {{by the work of}} fire researchers and fire engineers dating back to the 1960 s. Testing efforts of product manufacturers and testing laboratories during the 1990 s have indicated that flames emitting from an exterior window can extend higher than 16. 5 ft. (5 m) above the top of the window; therefore, fire-stops must be included in the design. In multi-story construction, prevention of fire spreading from floor to floor is achieved by including a fire-stop in the space between the floor slab and a curtain wall. If the void between the floor and the curtain wall is not properly sealed, the fire can spread from the lower to the upper floors.

40|$|Visually, it {{is often}} the goal of any {{architecture}} to define a personality or individual character through {{the design of the}} façade. This face or skin, wrapped to the structural frame beneath, is often key to an architect's desire to evoke our emotions, instilling a sense of grandeur as if each new building were an artist's sculpture. In recent decades the desire for taller structures and, particularly, those that are competing for recognition to be among the tallest, if not the world's tallest, is reason to review the fire safety issues related to façade or curtain wall design. Additionally, due to the creativity of architects, new and unique façade designs are continually appearing. The risk of fire spread through articulated elements of the façade or vertically around the façade via the mechanism of flame leap, poses new concerns for the newest class of super highrise structures. Our understanding of fire and its mechanisms of spread in buildings no longer eludes us, however, the risks of fire spread related to super high-rise buildings and the façades that define their character has not been well examined.

50|$|<b>Perimeter</b> or <b>barrier</b> {{guarding}} {{refers to}} a barrier placed around a work area where an automated piece of equipment-like a robotic arm-performs a function. This type of guarding is generally a wire partition system, but also can {{take the form of}} pressure sensitive mats or light curtains. Wire partitions systems used as machine guards must be fixed in place either on the machine or around its perimeter. These guarding systems may be configured with various sizes of wire mesh, solid sheet metal, or clear polycarbonate panels. Use of these materials depends on the hazard being guarded and the distance between the hazard and the guard. Mesh opening size of the guard depends on the proximity of the guard to the hazard. If the guard is installed close to moving parts, the mesh openings must be smaller than if the guard is installed a greater distance away from the moving parts. Mesh opening sizes for specific distances from the hazard are defined in ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012. Solid barriers such as sheet metal or clear view polycarbonate can be used to shield the hazard as well as control sparks or liquids. Size of the barrier (height and width) must conform to ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012. Wire partition guards provide a means of access to the guarded equipment with doors, lift out sections, or other controlled openings.|$|R
40|$|For the {{development}} of new stadium concepts relevant aspects of planning are described with proven actual relations, created by a typological investigation of structures and use-specific organization. This is a basis, which is contentwise necessary, {{in order to be able}} to decide substantial initial parameters of a line of sight profile on grandstands. In that case at modern sports grounds or places of event "Sightlines and Safety" are inseparable In assistance of built examples and parameter studies, empirical investigations and a review on historical building defaults, the safety-relevant appropriate decision criteria are cleared up. In this way a planning instrument will be developped for sightline-construction, which qualifies the comfort of viewing accomodations. The requirements and technical recommendations to sports stadia changed in the process of the past decades very strongly. The desire for a higher comfort for the spectators and a better marketableness became clear defaults for new stadium designs. By the omission of many athletic careers the grandstand bodies move much closer to the pitch. This leads to the desired effect of closer atmosphere, but changes the viewing conditions for the spectators. The planning parameter "point of eye" or "C- value" become the quality standard with the evaluation of a grandstand. This is usually not further crucial in a Track and Field stadia, because of a sufficient distance of seating. By the increasing complexity of multi-functional use structures in stadium and arena the factors of influence become ever obscurer on the latest development of a modern grandstand, for example the issues of safety in pitch <b>perimeter</b> <b>barriers</b> of the "First row". Decisions and defaults from different responsibility ranges unnoticed interlink with diagram geometry of a sightline-profile. In a first step the building type is set into a historical context. The bases of seeing are described, the physics of the eye and the visual acuity criteria necessary for regarding. The moreover a sample person Modulor "EN" is being developed from the bases of the anthropometry. This way a contract-obligatory basis for a line of sight design can be represented by the overlay of historical proportion teachings, like the "golden section", with existing regulations and statistic data for body-measurements. In the next step an objective construction procedure for the sightline-determination is developed. Because of the past legislation C. E. N. Technical Commitees (TC's) defaults do not exist in a practice-relevant form to design a viewing accomodations and will not lead to its possible commitment of a qualitative comparison standard.

5000|$|The {{outermost}} or preventive <b>perimeter</b> zone, a <b>barrier</b> and sensor defense generally {{located along}} {{the perimeter of}} the installation, consisted of a single line of triple-strand concertina wire strung along a 16 kilometer-long [...] "main line of resistance" [...] (MLR), with areas in front of the wire protected by minefields. Between the spring of 1969 and 1970, the 485th GEEIA (Ground Electronics Engineering Installation Agency) Squadron and Air Force Systems Command tested Project Safe Look at Phù Cát AB. This prototype Perimeter Detection and Surveillance Subsystem (PDSS) combined sensors of a pressure-sensitive Westinghouse Balanced Pressure System with a magnetically sensitive Honeywell Multi-Concealed Instrumentation Detection System, both buried in front of the north defense sector. These were integrated with the AN/PPS-5/PPS-12 ground surveillance radars already in use by the USAF. The system worked well under optimum conditions, but suffered high-maintenance costs and degraded performance in high winds and rain. The system had not been field-tested in the United States, and because the intended combat test did not result in many hostile contacts, 37th SPS contributed approximately 12,500-man-hours simulating infiltrations for tests of the sensors. The high maintenance cost, waste of security man-hours, and drawdown of U.S. forces in Vietnam for whom the system was intended resulted in its discontinuation in mid-1970. Programmed perimeter defense plans for complete fencing and installation of permanent lighting were never brought to fruition. Key areas of the perimeter were defended using night vision devices and 130 portable floodlights.|$|R
