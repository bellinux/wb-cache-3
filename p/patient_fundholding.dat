40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether <b>fundholding</b> <b>patients</b> have shorter waiting times for surgery than non-fundholding patients {{and to establish}} if any such differences resulted from practices attaining fundholding status. DESIGN: Comparison of waiting times of <b>fundholding</b> and non-fundholding <b>patients</b> for elective surgery covered by the fundholding scheme at four providers over four years. Comparison of the waiting times for patients of practices in their last year outside and first year inside the fundholding scheme with those for patients of practices remaining non-fundholding. SETTING: West Sussex. SUBJECTS: Over 57, 000 patients on the elective waiting list who had operations purchased by a health authority or fundholding practice during 1992 - 6. Patients with booked or planned elective admissions were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Waiting times for <b>patients</b> of <b>fundholding</b> and non-fundholding <b>patients.</b> RESULTS: <b>Patients</b> of <b>fundholding</b> practices had significantly shorter waiting times than those of non-fundholders for all four providers and over all four years. Waiting times for patients did not fall until the year that the practices joined the fundholding scheme. CONCLUSIONS: Fundholding shortens waiting times. This may be because purchasing of elective surgery is best done at a practice level or because fundholding practices are funded overgenerously...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{series of}} {{government}} initatives in the UK have included strategies {{to improve the}} quality of services received by <b>patients,</b> including <b>fundholding,</b> the development of National Service Frameworks, clinical governance, and Personal Medical Services (PMS).

40|$|Under the UK fundholding scheme, general {{practices}} could {{elect to}} hold a budget to meet the costs of some types of elective surgery (chargeable admissions) for their patients. It was alleged that <b>patients</b> of <b>fundholding</b> practices had shorter waits for elective surgery than the patients of non-fundholders. Comparison of waiting times between fundholding and non-fundholding practices are potentially confounded by selection bias as fundholding was voluntary. We estimate {{the effect of a}} practice's fundholding status on the waiting times of its patients using both cross-sectional methods (OLS, propensity score, instrumental variables, Heckman selection correction and Heckman heterogenous effects estimators) and difference in differences methodologies to correct for selection bias. The estimated effect of fundholding status was to significantly reduce the waiting times for chargeable admissions of the patients of fundholders by 4. 1 - 6. 6 % (or 4 - 7 days) with the instrumental variables and Heckman selection correction estimators yielding the highest estimates. We also find that <b>patients</b> of <b>fundholding</b> practices had shorter waits (by 3. 7 % or 2 days) for non-chargeable elective admissions, suggesting that fundholders were able to obtain shorter waits for all types of elective admissions.

40|$|Background. The {{contributions}} of patients’ opinions to {{the evaluation of}} health care is widely acknowledged. This study investigates whether the <b>patients</b> of a <b>fundholding</b> practice perceived any changes in the services offered. Aim. To {{examine the effect of}} general practice <b>fundholding</b> on <b>patient</b> satisfaction with both primary and secondary care services. Method. In April 1992, questionnaires were sent to 180 patients in each of four second-wave fundholding practices and four non-fundholding practices in the former South East Thames region. This took place before any changes were made in the practices as a result of fundholding. Repeat questionnaires were sent 30 months later. Results. The overall response rate was 70 % in 1992 and 66 % in 1994 / 1995. Satisfaction levels were generally high for primary care services and changed little over time. There was no evidence to suggest that fundholding GPs were less inclined to prescribe or refer to secondary care services. Waiting times for the first appointment with a consultant in secondary care had reduced between 1992 and 1994 for patients referred from the fundholding practices. However, there were no differences in the time patients had to wait for subsequent treatments or further investigations. One-fifth of the <b>fundholding</b> <b>patients</b> referred to secondary care were seen by the specialist in their doctor’s surgery, and those seen in this setting preferred it. Conclusion. Patients perceived no major differences in primary care services over the period between the two surveys. There was some evidence of preferential treatment for <b>patients</b> of <b>fundholding</b> practices, but only in waiting times for the first appointment with the secondary care specialist...|$|R
40|$|Between 1991 and 1998 English general {{practices}} had {{the option}} of holding budgets for prescribing and elective secondary care. Fundholding was reintroduced in 2005. We examine the effect of fundholding on patients’ satisfaction with their practice, using a cross section of 4441 patients from 60 practices {{in the last year of}} fundholding (1998). We employ instrumental variables to allow for the endogeneity of <b>fundholding.</b> <b>Patients</b> of fundholders were less satisfied with the opening hours of their practice, their GP's knowledge of their medical history, with their GP's ability to arrange tests and willingness to refer to a specialist, and were more likely to agree that their doctor was more concerned about keeping costs down. Fundholder practices performed better on a number of process measures of care, and <b>fundholding</b> <b>patients</b> were more satisfied with additional non-medical services provided by the practice. The probability that patients were overall at least very satisfied with their GP practice was 0. 073 (95...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{estimate}} the amount spent on specific hospital care by health agencies in 1993 - 4 {{and compare it}} with the resources allocated to <b>patients</b> registered with <b>fundholding</b> practices for {{the same type of}} care. To investigate whether fundholding practices and health agencies pay different amounts for inpatient care. DESIGN [...] Examination of hospital episode statistics, 1991 census data, and family health services authority and health agency records. SETTING [...] Health agencies and fundholding practices in the former North West Thames Regional Health Authority. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Amount per capita allocated to inpatient and outpatient care for <b>patients</b> registered with <b>fundholding</b> and non-fundholding practices. Average specialty cost per finished consultant episode for health agencies and fundholding practices. RESULTS [...] The ratio of per capita funding for patients in non-fundholding practices to those in fundholding practices ranged from 59 % to 87 % for inpatient and day case care and from 36 % to 106 % for outpatient care. Average specialty costs per episode were similar for fundholding practices and health agencies. CONCLUSIONS [...] Fundholding practices seem to have been funded more generously than non-fundholding practices in North West Thames...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I model {{the demand for}} and supply of {{elective}} surgery using a modified Hotelling framework in which waiting time, money and distance costs are determinants of the demand for hospital care. Hospitals {{compete with each other}} by varying supply and hence their waiting times. I consider both the situation where GPs do not hold a budget (and thus Health Authorities pay for health care), and the situation where they are given budgets to buy care for their patients. Waiting time increases when production of care becomes more expensive, when the benefit obtained from treatment increases, when the unit cost of distance decreases, and when the importance given to the delay by the hospitals decreases. Moreover, the higher the money price (and if greater than the marginal cost of producing hospital care) the lower the waiting time. If the money price paid by GP fundholders is higher than that paid by HAs, <b>fundholding</b> <b>patients</b> pay a lower time price. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Counselling {{services}} are now widespread within general practice. Although the cost-effectiveness of such services {{has yet to}} be fully investigated, benefits could include a reduction in prescribing of psychotropic drugs and of other drugs. AIM: A study set out to determine whether practices with counsellors differed from those without in terms of their prescribing rates and costs of psychotropic drugs. METHOD: Prescribing analyses and cost (PACT) level two data reports for the quarter to November 1991 ending January 1992, as appropriate, were sought from 354 practices with counsellors and a matched sample of 216 practices without counsellors which had participated in a previous national survey of counselling in general practice. The drug groups examined were: hypnotics and anxiolytics; antidepressants; analgesics; all central nervous system drugs; and all drugs apart from central nervous system drugs. For each group of drugs, the numbers of prescribed items, total prescribing costs, and costs per item were expressed as a proportion of the practice's number of prescribing units (that is, the age-adjusted number of registered patients) and {{as a percentage of the}} average for similar practices in its family health services authority. Practice characteristics were compared between practices with an on-site counsellor and those without. Practices with and without counsellors were compared with respect to their prescribing indicators. RESULTS: PACT reports were obtained from 214 practices (response rate 38 %) [...] 126 with counsellors and 88 without. Practices with counsellors and practices without counsellors were well matched in terms of location, list size, proportion of elderly <b>patients,</b> training and <b>fundholding</b> status, and number of health promotion clinics. No significant differences were found between practices with and without counsellors in the prescribing indicators for any group of psychotropic drugs examined or for central nervous system drugs as a whole. CONCLUSION: There were no appreciable differences found in this study between practices with and without counsellors in terms of psychotropic drug prescribing rates or costs. The reasons for this are unclear; more indepth studies of individual counselling {{services are}} required...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{popularity}} of complementary medicine {{continues to be}} asserted by the professional associations and umbrella organisations of these therapies. Within conventional medicine there are also signs that attitudes towards some of the complementary therapies are changing. AIM: To describe the scale and scope of access to complementary therapies (acupuncture, chiropractic, homoeopathy, hypnotherapy, medical herbalism, and osteopathy) via general practice in England. DESIGN OF STUDY: A postal questionnaire sent to 1226 individual general practitioners (GPs) in a random cluster sample of GP partnerships in England. GPs received up to three reminders. SETTING: One in eight (1226) GP partnerships in England in 1995. METHOD: Postal questionnaire to assess {{estimates of the number}} of practices offering 'in-house' access to a range of complementary therapies or making National Health Service (NHS) referrals outside the practice; sources of funding for provision and variations by practice characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 964 GPs replied (78. 6 %). Of these, 760 provided detailed information. An estimated 39. 5 % (95 % CI = 35 %- 43 %) of GP partnerships in England provided access to some form of complementary therapy for their NHS patients. If all non-responding partnerships are assumed to be non-providers, the lowest possible estimate is 30. 3 %. An estimated 21. 4 % (95 % CI = 19 %- 24 %) were offering access via the provision of treatment by a member of the primary health care team, 6. 1 % (95 % CI = 2 %- 10 %) employed an 'independent' complementary therapist, and an estimated 24. 6 % of partnerships (95 % CI = 21 %- 28 %) had made NHS referrals for complementary therapies. The reported volume of provision within any individual service tended to be low. Acupuncture and homoeopathy were the most commonly available therapies. Patients made some payment for 25 % of practice-based provision. Former fundholding practices were significantly more likely to offer complementary therapies than non-fundholding practices, (45 % versus 36 %, P = 0. 02). Fundholding did not affect the range of therapies offered, and <b>patients</b> from former <b>fundholding</b> practices were no more likely to pay for treatment. CONCLUSION: Access to complementary health care for NHS patients was widespread in English general practices in 1995. This data suggests that a limited range of complementary therapies were acceptable to a large proportion of GPs. Fundholding clearly provided a mechanism for the provision of complementary therapies in primary care. Patterns of provision are likely to alter with the demise of fundholding and existing provision may significantly reduce unless the Primary Care Groups or Primary Care Trusts are prepared to support the 'levelling up' of some services...|$|R
