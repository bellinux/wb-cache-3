This {{flies in the face}} of traditional waiver rules, under which a waiver of privilege to one’s adversary generally is a waiver to all adversaries on that subject matter. Based on years of frustration with discovery costs, fear of corporate fraud, and heavy burdens placed on administrative agencies, many legal scholars praised selective waiver as a cure for those ills. Recently, when the Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules met to discuss additions to the FRE, many called for the inclusion of a selective waiver provision.

The physico-chemical data were related to the location of the colouring materials on the site, in association with exceptionally well preserved “hut” structures. It was thus possible to demonstrate that none of these materials, either red or black, was heated before being used, contrary to what had been assumed so far.

40|$|Managing an efficient, but fair, pretrial {{process in}} a large and complex case {{has always been a}} challenge. With the advent of {{electronic}} communications and the corresponding explosion of privilege claims, this challenge has become significantly more difficult. Indeed, {{it is not uncommon for}} corporate parties to assert tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of privilege claims. Furthermore, the resolution of these privilege questions is often compounded by difficult choice of law questions that can have the result of different substantive principles being applied to identical discovery demands originating in different jurisdictions. Additionally, before addressing the increasingly voluminous and complicated privilege question, many parties often raise other discovery issues that must be resolved before depositions and document production can proceed in a meaningful fashion. With this increase in the numbers of claims, the privilege resolution process has become significantly more costly. The initial costs in locating documents, assessing their privilege character, preparing privilege logs, and developing evidence to substantiate each claim can be overwhelming. Compounding this effort is metadata underlying most electronic documents that may also contain <b>privileged</b> <b>materials.</b> These enormous costs are further increased when special masters must be appointed to examine the millions of pages of materials that active judges have neither the time nor the paralegal resources to coordinate, review, and individually rule upon.

Enshrined in §3, the work-product doctrine protects tangible (and some intangible) items created in anticipation of the litigation (e.g., a memorandum from an attorney outlining his strategy in the case). Protecting work product is considered in the interest of justice because discovery of such work product would expose an attorney's complete legal strategy before trial. §4 allows discovery of experts whose opinions may be presented at trial, but limits discovery of experts not likely to testify during trial. §5 generally prohibits the discovery of any material legally privileged (attorney-client, doctor-patient, etc.), and requires the production of a [...] "privilege log" [...] which describes the privileged information or material in a way that allows others to see that (if) it is privileged, but does not divulge the <b>privileged</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E

In light of this the district court erred in requiring the production of documents obtained or prepared by retained counsel in anticipation of litigation absent necessity or other circumstances. Petitioner's argument that protection of trial preparation materials unduly benefits corporate defendants against individual plaintiffs is not persuasive as discovery may work to the disadvantage {{as well as to the}} advantage of individual plaintiffs. While discovery should be granted liberally there are limits, such as a prohibition on discovery of bad faith discovery requests or attempts to obtain <b>privileged</b> <b>material.</b> Furthermore defendant's argument that such material is protected by attorney-client privilege is faulty because statements, memoranda, and mental impressions do not fall under such privilege because those materials do not document interaction with the client. Petitioner having been granted the list of those interviewed has full ability to consult those individuals itself or to consult the public records available on the subject. Petitioner had not showed any prejudicial effect of denying discovery. It is essential that counsel who historically are officers of the court be able to work with a certain degree of privacy free from unnecessary intrusion by opposing parties and their counsel. Consequently the [...] "work product" [...] of the attorney inevitably reflects the mental impressions of the attorney such that if discovery were granted much less would be written and much more would be forgotten consequently leading to inefficiency, unfairness, and sharp practices which would inevitably develop in the giving of legal advice in turn damaging the legal profession and the interests of justice and discovery. In cases of necessity turning over this information may be permissible when information is embedded in the attorney work product but only when alternate methods of acquiring the method are unavailable.

Chapter 1 entails an overview of the development of palladium- and copper-catalysed carbon-heteroatom bond forming processes. The application of these processes in heterocycle synthesis using ortho -(haloalkenyl) aryl halide and ortho -haloacetanilides/ α-(ortho -haloaryl) ketone precursors is also described.

40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{three ways}} in which bank regulation has spawned significant exceptions to the ordinary judicial and administrative understanding of the attorney-client privilege. First, federal banking agencies assert {{that they have the}} legal authority selectively to compel banks and other financial institutions they supervise to disclose attorney-client privileged information. Second, when banks disclose <b>privileged</b> <b>material</b> to bank regulators, even if voluntarily, banks retain the privilege with respect to third parties pursuant to specific federal statutory authority. Third, under agency policy, once bank regulators obtain privileged information from a bank, whether through compulsion or voluntarily, the regulators reserve the right to share the information with any other government agency, notwithstanding the selective waiver statute. This state of affairs raises questions about the wisdom of the federal banking laws and regulatory policies, but also it raises questions about the conventional privilege doctrine: Is the public interest best served if bank regulators can compel banks to disclose confidential attorney-client communications, even with express statutory protections against third party access? If so, is bank regulation unique in this respect, or would the public be best served if other regulatory and law enforcement agencies, such as the SEC or the DOJ, had a similar power, and if entities could generally disclose <b>privileged</b> <b>material</b> to these other public agencies without waiving the privilege generally?

Each subject was measured for height, body weight to assess nutritional status and clinically observed for various oral health traits like dental caries, plaque, calculus and gingivitis. Results: Decayed, missing due to caries and filled teeth (DMF) index was low among adolescent children; it was 0. 48 in males and 0. 93 in females. Prevalence of calculus was higher among females through all age groups, while prevalence of plaque was higher among males. Sex differences were significant only for plaque index and DMF index. The inadequacy of nutrition was not a major determinant for the observed magnitude of soft deposits, plaque and calculus indices except for Oral health status index and DMF index where higher magnitude of the indices were observed in underweight children than the normal.

40|$|Abstract : Despite an {{increasing}} number of studies, colouring materials are still poorly understood among excavation remains. Their attraction lies in their capacity to bring to light diverse and complex skills, but also in their intense colouring power and their contrasting colours : red and black, which still possess a symbolic value. These highly symbolic materials may, therefore, highlight the “conceptual” practices of prehistoric men and give access to their symbolic world and thought. In such a particular context as the transition between the Middle and the Upper Palaeolithic, these remains, which are very abundant in most excavations, offer the possibility, through analysis, to get an exceptional insight into the way of life of the last Neanderthals. The Châtelperronian site of the “Grotte du Renne”, in Arcy-sur-Cure (Yonne), is a landmark. It was excavated beween 1949 and 1963 by André Leroi-Gourhan : Numerous colouring materials were discovered there, and Leroi-Gourhan developed theories about their transformation and uses which so far have not been tested, and have remained unchallenged. Since their discovery, the assumption is that those minerals were heated in a controlled way, in order to modify their colour. It is indeed well-known that heat transforms yellow materials (iron hydroxides) in orange, red or purple materials (iron oxides). From this hypothesis originates the theory according to which Neanderthals exploited colouring materials as pigments for symbolic or even aesthetic purposes. But the theory has so far never been proved true. Our study combines several sets of data, obtained from different methods. Physico-chemical and petrological analyses were carried out on the colouring materials. These data were related to their location on the site, in association with exceptionally well preserved “hut” structures. Furthermore, a series of experimentations, aimed to characterize powders obtained via different methods (grinding and crushing on the one hand, abrasion on the other hand). The comparison of all these data enabled us to identify the various technical choices which informed the supply in colouring minerals in all the Châtelperronian levels of the Grotte du Renne. It was thus possible to demonstrate that none of these materials, either red or black, was heated before being used, contrary to what had been assumed so far. The supply in colouring materials was as carefully organised as for other materials (ﬂint, for example); they were collected in geological formations occasionally showing on the surface, at more than 10 km from the cave. The exploitation of these geological sites did not vary during the whole Châtelperronian period, and <b>privileged</b> <b>materials</b> which can easily be ground into powder. Part of their supply was ground coarsely in order to cover large surface areas (soils or hides) as preservative or to clean them up. The remaining materials were destined to more meticulous activities, which required a ﬁne, regular, and highly-colouring powder. In this latter case, the Neanderthals of the Grotte du Renne used those products when working on bone materials (bone or mammoth ivory), and used them also for their sheer colour. The set of colouring minerals from the Grotte du Renne reveals Neanderthals’ in-depth knowledge of materials; they understood perfectly well their properties and qualities, and used them extensively, so that the Châtelperronian site must have been a literally dazzling sight, all red and black. The “chaîne opératoire” which transpires from our analysis shows very sophisticated techniques, and an advanced “technological” knowledge. They are witness to surprising capacities and a highly-evolved pattern of thought...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the neglected link between materialism and person perception. It extends recent {{research into the}} influence of material possessions on first impressions by investigating how materialism (as a set of socio-cultural representations and as an individual value orientation) affects {{the way in which}} adolescents from different social class backgrounds perceive a person who is portrayed as either owning or lacking expensive possessions. One hundred and sixty-eight respondents (93 middle-class, 75 working-class) read one of four vignettes which described the same woman or man in either affluent or less <b>privileged</b> <b>material</b> circumstances. They then evaluated that person's income and personal qualities, and completed Richins and Dawson's (1992) materialism scale. Both working-class and middle-class adolescents formed similar impressions, which favour the person who owns, rather than lacks, expensive possessions. This can be interpreted as a facet of materialism at a socio-cultural level. The impact of individually held materialistic values on impressions was comparatively weak, but they moderated the strength with which materialistic socio-cultural representations about wealth and poverty are reproduced.

40|$|Since September 11, 2001, President George W. Bush’s Administration has {{repeatedly}} asserted the state secrets privilege as {{grounds for the}} dismissal of civil cases challenging the legality of its conduct {{in the war on}} terror. Specifically, the Administration has sought dismissal of all cases challenging two different government practices: (1) its use of “extraordinary rendition,” under which the Executive removes suspected terrorists to foreign countries for interrogation; and (2) the National Security Agency’s (NSA’s) warrantless wiretapping of electronic communications. The government argues that the plaintiffs’ claims in these cases can neither be proven nor defended against without disclosure of information that would jeopardize national security, and thus it seeks to have all cases related to these activities dismissed on the pleadings. This issue brief provides a general overview of the state secrets privilege and then discusses the Bush Administration’s recent assertion of the privilege in cases challenging extraordinary rendition and the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping program. As will be explained, the Administration’s blanket invocation of the privilege as grounds for immediate dismissal of these categories of cases is unprecedented, and threatens to eliminate the judiciary’s role as a check on executive action. For that reason, courts should seek methods of protecting <b>privileged</b> <b>material</b> without dismissing litigation, as they have successfully done in the past, to ensure that legitimate challenges to these and other government actions get a fair hearing in court. In addition, the next presidential administration should revise its internal procedures and work with courts to limit the effect of the state secrets privilege so that it is used as originally intended, rather than as a de facto attempt to immunize executive action from judicial review. Finally, Congress should move quickly to pass pending legislation that would prevent indiscriminate use of the state secrets privilege...|$|E

Militaristic societies are ones in which the armed forces enjoy a <b>privileged</b> <b>material</b> and cultural status, and where military priorities and frames of thinking {{play a key role in}} policymaking and political culture (Vagts 1981, Evans and Newnham 1988). Militarism is not limited to direct governance by uniformed personnel (“praetorianism”), but may instead coexist with substantive democratic institutions (Ben Eliezer 1997). Thus, contemporary societies described as militaristic are as politically diverse as Switzerland and Burma, North and South Korea, Jordan and Israel. This chapter explores the interface between environmental and military issues in Israel, placing it within the context of the changing fortunes of Israeli militarism. In particular, it is argued that growing public willingness to challenge the military’s environmentally destructive behavior in the last decades was linked to wider transformations in Israeli society. The Oslo Accords and the rise of liberalindividualist outlooks associated with globalization and consumer culture weakened the country’s founding collectivist ideology in favor of material values associated with quality of life. In this context, the military lost its previous immunity to public criticism, and environmental concerns, formerly considered luxuries in comparison with security matters, were able to gain ground in the public sphere alongside other civil agendas. The chapter begins by stating the case for viewing Israel as a militaristic society. It then surveys the military’s environmental activity and the environmental destruction it has wrought, while also noting some early successes in the area of nature conservation. Finally, it discusses how, since the 1990 s, the environmental movement and affected residents, as well as the Ministry of Environment and State Comptroller, have pushed the military to clean up its act...|$|E
5000|$|His {{best known}} {{contribution}} to constructivism is {{set out in}} World of Our Making (University of South Carolina Press, 1989). His approach {{is based on a}} continuum of performative language, rules and rule. Three types of speech act (instructive, hierarchichal, commissive) yield corresponding types of rule that, in turn, yield three types of rule (hegemony, hierarchy, heteronomy). Compliance with rules helps sustain rule, but failure to abide by them erodes rule. Rule, generally through institutionalized means, has distributive effects in political society (domestic or international), granting <b>privileged</b> access to <b>material</b> and symbolic resources to some agents over others. [...] One novelty of this approach is to go beyond the 'anarchy problematique' in IR (Richard Ashley's term). Instead of different types of anarchy (as in Alexander Wendt's Hobbesian, Lockean, and Kantian anarchichal settings), Onuf presents hegemony, hierarchy, and heteronomy as different structures of domination in world affairs (i.e. the absence of world government does not necessarily imply anarchy). These structures are respectively enabled by the repetition over time of behavior consistent with instructive, hierarchichal, and commissive rules by agents.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} several strands of enquiry are braided together. Accounts eo-created with migrant {{participants}} are <b>privileged,</b> theoretical <b>material</b> is critically appraised {{and a range}} of analytical resources employed. The various explorations follow particular trajectories that make some aspects visible whilst occluding others. Critical appraisal of selected examples of empirical psychological research provides insight into processes by which constructs of migration may be generated and employed, and the authority conferred to this type of research in social and political migration policies is questioned. In recognition {{of the importance of the}} host locality in a migrant's ability to adapt, an overview of Manchester's historical, economic and social features is presented and the policy ofmulti-culturalism is discussed. Understandings ofloss and stress that may be associated with migrations are examined through close critique of particular psychoanalytic perspectives on migrations. A resulting broad analytic frame is developed to explore the participants' accounts. To expand understandings of self and culture as intertwined, the meta- theories of the Dialogical Self and Dialogism are examined. Through engaging these meta-theories a deeper exploration of psycho cultural subjectivities is undertaken. Particular contested polyvocalities are identified as themata of "Culture" and "Colour of skin, 'race', belonging". These themata are explored through progressive braiding of pertinent theoretical resources and further critical discursive and dialogical analyses of constructed subjectivities. A concluding discussion appraises the contributions, strengths and weaknesses of this thesis and identifies its particular contributions to knowledge. Words: 237 Keywords: migration, psycho-cultural, subjectivities, discursive, dialogical, dialogism, themata. Acknowledgements. I would like to thank my participants for sharing with me their experiences and understandings of migration. I am grateful to Prof Erica Burman who has consistently given me invaluable fe~dback on drafts of my work and in supervision. She has adeptly balanced challenge wIth. en~ouragement in helping me to identify my occlusions, prejudices, anxieties and my limits of understanding. By so doing she has enabled me to move beyond many of my previously habitual or normalised understandings. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} discuss the {{practices}} of teachers continuing formation {{for the use of}} information and communication technologies inside the present public policy of digital inclusion, implemented by the Department of Education of Minas Gerais State - the Escolas em Rede project. In it, the teaching methodologies used in the processes of teachers' formation are analyzed, as well as the learning environments and the learning <b>materials</b> <b>privileged</b> in the actions of the program. The process of formation of teachers is also analyzed based on SEE-MG project's documentation, aiming to understand, at the same time, the vision of teachers, trainers and coordinators involved in the proposed training. The article {{is the result of a}} Msc. qualitative research, in the form of a case study, with two classes of teachers who participated of the training processes developed by the project of digital inclusion Escolas em Rede, of SEE-MG. The analyses of the survey data highlights that the policy of digital inclusion of SEE-MG has been suffering of the same problems as other historical public policies in the area, since it needs better technological infrastructure and personnel to give support to the practices of use of the ICT in schools. Furthermore, there is still a vertical implementation of the project, considering that the policy does not relate to the reality of teachers and their schools of origin, at any time, causing a gap between the SEE-MG program and the real demands of the educational institutions and the educators of the State...|$|R
