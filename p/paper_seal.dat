6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} could see some of their {{compositions}} [...] . so much do I wish it that I'll send you copies of some written recently. Last week I told the fourth class I wanted them to write me letters about anything they pleased, adding by way of suggestion that they might tell me of some place they had visited or some interesting thing or person they had seen. They were to write the letters on real note <b>paper,</b> <b>seal</b> them in an envelope, and address them to me, all without any assistance from other people. Last Friday morning I found a pile of letters on my desk and that evening I realized afresh that teaching has its pleasures {{as well as its}} pains. Those compositions would atone for much. Here is Ned Clay's, address, spelling, and grammar as originally penned.|$|E
60|$|I am {{not certain}} that I had ever really {{appreciated}} before that hour the extreme peril of the adventure on which I was embarked. The sight of my cousin, the look of his face--so handsome, so jovial at the first sight, and branded with so much malignity as you saw it on the second--with his hyperbolical curls in order, with his neckcloth tied {{as if for the}} conquests of love, setting forth (as I had no doubt in the world he was doing) to clap the Bow Street runners on my trail, and cover England with handbills, each dangerous as a loaded musket, convinced {{me for the first time}} that the affair was no less serious than death. I believe it came to a near touch whether I should not turn the horses' heads at the next stage and make directly for the coast. But I was now in the position of a man who should have thrown his gage into the den of lions; or, better still, like one who should have quarrelled overnight under the influence of wine, and now, at daylight, in a cold winter's morning, and humbly sober, must make good his words. It is not that I thought any the less, or any the less warmly, of Flora. But, as I smoked a grim segar that morning in a corner of the chaise, no doubt I considered, in the first place, that the letter-post had been invented, and admitted privately to myself, in the second, that it would have been highly possible to write her on a piece of <b>paper,</b> <b>seal</b> it, and send it skimming by the mail, instead of going personally into these egregious dangers, and through a country that I beheld crowded with gibbets and Bow Street officers. As for Sim and Candlish, I doubt if they crossed my mind.|$|E

5000|$|The course {{comprised}} {{a self-contained}} kit of course materials, film cassettes, visual aids, and games. Some {{of the activities}} were very imaginative; a game based upon reindeer [...] had a loaded die to introduce discussion about instincts, and a <b>paper</b> <b>seal</b> would be cut up and shared among class members representing various people in the Netsilik community, according to a ritual governing who was entitled to which part of the animal.|$|E
50|$|Election watchdogs were {{generally}} {{satisfied with the}} conduct of the election. In a statement, the Legal Network for Truthful Elections (LENTE) said that The canvassing went very well. It took ten hours. Delay was due to a lot of petitions for exclusion by the lawyers of the two main candidates in the recall. Petitions were primarily based on missing inner <b>paper</b> <b>seal,</b> missing statistical data, missing thumbmarks and allegations of fraud, tampering of the ERs (election returns).|$|E
50|$|Legal {{instrument}} {{is a legal}} term of art that is used for any formally executed written document that can be formally attributed to its author, records and formally expresses a legally enforceable act, process, or contractual duty, obligation, or right, and therefore evidences that act, process, or agreement. Examples include a , deed, bond, contract, will, legislative act, notarial act, court writ or process, or any law passed by a competent legislative body in municipal (domestic) or international law. Many legal instruments were written under seal by affixing a wax or <b>paper</b> <b>seal</b> to the document in evidence of its legal execution and authenticity (which often removed the need for consideration in contract law); however, today many jurisdictions have done away with the requirement of documents being under seal {{in order to give}} them legal effect.|$|E

5000|$|Akutagami (25): This Tsukumogami was {{supposed}} to be created from an old Japanese fan and a new air conditioner, but due to a mistake on Shizuka's part, some trash was also combined. As a Tsukumogami is supposed to be made out of just two objects—one old and one new, this third one made it weaker, and adding that it was useless trash, Akutagami turned out to be too weak-minded and too kind to be of any use to Dark Shadow. After being spared by Eiji in battle because of his extreme ignorance, Akutagami accidentally eats the Fruit of Wisdom that fell into one of his compartments, a Precious that turns the eater into a genius. Dark Shadow tries to use him but the now super-smart Akutagami decides to abandon Dark Shadow instead and turns to help SGS to find the Precious. However, after getting a bad impression on humanity, Akutagami decides to make them all pay for the world's sake, only trusting Eiji by giving him a <b>paper</b> <b>seal.</b> The Boukengers attack him in order to stop his rampage, but with his superior intellect and mastery of ninjustu allows Akutagami to easily defeat them. When Akutagami fought Eiji, Eiji pleads with him to stop, whereupon the Tsukumogami cryptically replies [...] "there's no time left." [...] Before Akutagami can explain, Yaiba impales him on his katana as punishment for abandoning Dark Shadow. When Yaiba finds that the Fruit of Wisdom is gone, Gekko turns him into a giant puppet in order to destroy the Boukengers. Though thought to be destroyed by the very <b>paper</b> <b>seal</b> he gave, it actually restored Akutagami to his original size and free from Dark Shadow's control, but forgot all about what happened or Eiji, who having seen this, decides to tell him to go to the woods, and find a place where nobody would harm him. [...] means [...] "trash" [...] in Japanese. Akutagami's design is based on Kyuukyuu Sentai GoGoFives Liner Boy. Voiced by Kōichi Sakaguchi (Sakaguchi Kōichi), who previously voiced Duke Org Yabaiba in Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger. The plot of the episode and character is very similar to the protagonist Charlie in Flowers for Algernon.|$|E
50|$|From {{the initial}} {{introduction}} in 1982, to the country- wide use of EVM in 2004, Election commission of India took long and measured steps spanning {{over a period}} of nearly two decades, in the matter of electronic voting. In the meanwhile, general elections to various legislative assemblies, and numerous by-elections and two general elections to the Lok Sabha have been conducted using EVMs at all polling stations. The tamper-proof technological soundness of the EVM has been endorsed by a technical experts subcommittee appointed at the initiative of the Parliamentary Committee on Electoral Reforms in 1990. This experts committee (1990) was headed by Prof S.Sampath, then Chairman RAC, Defence Research and Development Organisation, with Prof P.V.Indiresan,then with IIT, Delhi, and Dr C.Rao Kasarabada, then Director Electronic Research and Development Center, Trivandrum as members. Subsequently, the Commission has also been consulting a group of technical experts comprising Prof P.V. Indiresan (who was also part of the earlier committee referred to above) and Prof D.T. Sahani and Prof A.K Agarwala both of IIT Delhi, regularly, on all EVM related technical issues. Besides, the Commission has in place elaborate administrative measures and procedural checks-and -balances aimed at total transparency and prevention of any possible misuse or procedural lapses. These measures include rigorous pre-election checking of each EVM by the technicians, two level randomization with the involvement of political parties, candidates, their agents, for the random allotment of the EVMs to various constituencies and subsequently to various polling stations, preparation of the EVMs for elections {{in the presence of the}} candidates/their agents, and the Election Observers, provision for various thread seal and <b>paper</b> <b>seal</b> protection against any unauthorized access to the EVMs after preparation, mock poll in the presence of polling agents and mock poll certification system before the commencement of poll, post poll sealing and strong room protection, randomization of counting staff, micro observers at the counting tables, and so on.|$|E

50|$|Books and {{scholarship}} {{on the various}} inkstones of China existed chiefly in Japan, where a long bibliography on the subject exists. Inkstones should be appreciated {{in the context of}} the traditional scholar's studio culture and the appreciation of furnishings, antiques, <b>paper,</b> <b>seals</b> and all other associated objects.

Aluminum foils wrap chocolate bars and prevent a transfer of water vapor while being lightweight, non-toxic and odor proof. Vegetable parchment lines boxes of high-quality confections like gourmet chocolates. Cardboard cartons are less common, though they offer many options concerning thickness and movement of water and oil.|$|R
