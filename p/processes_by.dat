5|$|The {{absence of}} wheels in nature is {{frequently}} attributed to constraints imposed by biology: natural selection constrains the evolutionary paths available to species, and the <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> which multicellular organisms grow and develop may {{not permit the}} construction of a functioning wheel.|$|E
5|$|Geology is {{the science}} and study of the solid and liquid matter that {{constitutes}} the Earth. The field of geology encompasses {{the study of the}} composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.|$|E
5|$|Hoover trained its {{engineers}} to produce C5s and tested its manufacturing <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> assembling, dismantling and re-assembling 100 C5s. Full production began in November 1984 and by early January 1985 over 2,500 C5s had been manufactured. Each production line could produce 50 vehicles an hour, and Hoover {{were capable of}} producing up to 8,000 C5s per week.|$|E

50|$|The <b>process</b> <b>by</b> which a supramolecular {{assembly}} forms is called molecular self-assembly. Some try to distinguish self-assembly as the <b>process</b> <b>by</b> which individual molecules form the defined aggregate. Self-organization, then, is the <b>process</b> <b>by</b> which those aggregates create higher-order structures. This can become useful {{when talking about}} liquid crystals and block copolymers.|$|R

5|$|Martingales {{can also}} be created from {{stochastic}} <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> applying some suitable transformations, which {{is the case for}} the homogeneous Poisson process (on the real line) resulting in a martingale called the compensated Poisson process. Martingales {{can also be}} built from other martingales. For example, there are martingales based on the martingale the Wiener process, forming continuous-time martingales.|$|E
5|$|This teleonomy is {{the quality}} whereby the process of natural {{selection}} creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles they perform. The <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> which the changes occur, {{from one generation to}} another, are called evolutionary processes or mechanisms. The four most widely recognised evolutionary processes are natural selection (including sexual selection), genetic drift, mutation and gene migration due to genetic admixture. Natural selection and genetic drift sort variation; mutation and gene migration create variation.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the metabolic rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history {{of life on}} Earth traces the <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> which living and fossil organisms evolved since life appeared on the planet, until the present. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years (Ga) ago and {{there is evidence that}} life appeared as early as 4.1 Ga. The similarities among all present-day organisms indicate the presence of a common ancestor from which all known species have diverged through the process of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct. Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.9 million are estimated to have been named and 1.6 million documented in a central database to date. More recently, in May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.|$|E
5|$|The second idea {{means that}} {{processes}} can offer their services to other <b>processes</b> <b>by</b> providing virtual files {{that appear in}} the other processes' namespace. The client process's input/output on such a file becomes inter-process communication between the two processes. This way, Plan 9 generalizes the Unix notion of the filesystem as the central point of access to computing resources. It carries over Unix's idea of device files {{to provide access to}} peripheral devices (mice, removable media, etc.) and the possibility to mount filesystems residing on physically distinct filesystems into a hierarchical namespace, but adds the possibility to mount a connection to a server program that speaks a standardized protocol and treat its services as part of the namespace.|$|E

The most essential difference between ordinary micro-milling and UVAM {{lies in the}} trajectory of cutter tooth.
