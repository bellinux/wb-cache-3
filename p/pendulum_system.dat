40|$|Background. The {{influence}} of the delay of interaction between pendulum and electric motor and the delay of the medium on the dynamics of non-ideal <b>pendulum</b> <b>systems</b> of the type ?pendulum-electric motor? is considered. Mathematical model of this system is a system of ordinary differential equations with delay. Objective. The {{influence of}} delay factors on steady-state oscillations of non-ideal <b>pendulum</b> <b>systems</b> of the type ?pendulum?electric motor? is studied. Methods. The approaches that reduce the mathematical model of the system {{to a system of}} three or fifteen differential equations without delay are suggested. For general analysis of nonlinear dynamics the maps of dynamical regimes are constructed. These maps allow conducting a qualitative identification of the type of steady-state regime. The construction of dynamical regimes maps is based on analysis and processing of spectrum of Lyapunov characteristic exponents. Phase portraits of regular and chaotic attractors are constructed. Results. The use of three-dimensional mathematical model to study the dynamics of ?pendulum?electric motor? systems is sufficient only at small values of the delay. For relatively high values of the delay multi-dimensional system of fifteen equations should be used. Conclusions. The essential {{influence of the}} delay on qualitative change in the dynamic characteristics in ?pendulum?electric motor? systems is shown. In some cases the delay is the controlling factor in the process of chaotization of <b>pendulum</b> <b>systems.</b> ????????????. ??????????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????????? ????? ????????? ? ????????????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ????? ?? ???????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????? ???? ??????????????????????????. ?????????????? ??????? ????? ??????? ???????? ??????? ???????????? ???????????????? ????????? ? ?????????????. ???? ????????????. ???? ?????? ? ??????????? ??????? ???????? ???????????? ?? ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????? ???? ??????????????????????????. ???????? ??????????. ?????????? ???????, ??????? ????????? ?????? ?????????????? ?????? ??????? ? ??????? ???? ??? ?????????? ???????????????? ????????? ??? ????????????. ??? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ???????? ???? ?????? ????????? ????? ???????????? ???????, ??????? ????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????????? ???? ??????????????? ??????. ???????? ?????????? ???? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ?? ??????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????????????? ???????????. ????????? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ???????????. ?????????? ????????????. ???????????, ??? ??? ???????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????????????????????? ??? ????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ??????. ??? ???????????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ??????, ??????? ??????? ?? ?????????? ?????????. ??????. ???????? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ?? ???????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????????? ? ???????? ???? ??????????????????????????. ? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ??????????? ???????? ? ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ??????...|$|R

40|$|New {{trends in}} {{engineering}} {{based on the}} idea of smart materials and smart structures lead to new classes of structural optimization problems. Structures equiped with a system of sensors, actuators and processors enable to change the behaviour of the object during its exploitation. This gives the possibility to design structures with quite new qualitative and quantitative characteristics. One of the new approaches to design and modelling of structures is to apply <b>pendulum</b> <b>systems</b> as actuators. In the present paper vibrations of structures optimized by using additional <b>pendulum</b> <b>systems</b> to control the motion of the object will be discussed. Particulary massive and heavy weight structures like e. g. towers, tall buildings, musts, bridges etc. met in civil engineering are examples where this kind of actuators are of great importance. The paper deals with the following optimal problem: how to optimize the motion of the pendulum mass to damp the vibrations of the structure in terms of given loads constraints and cost function. For simplicity the flexible structure was model by a lumped mass system of points. Thus the dynamic process have been described by a system of ordinary differential equations. To optimize the process of vibrations the Pontryagin maximum principle is used. Different types of beams and frames under action of different <b>pendulum</b> <b>systems</b> like: ordinary, inverted and placed on a cart have been considered. As objective function the maximal amplitude of vibrations was taken into account. Diagrams of optimal vibrations and pendulum controls illustrate the effectiveness of the solution...|$|R

Advantages and disadvantages of tri-linear behavior over bi-linear one are scrutinized by studying the effect of main parameters such as issolation period, amplitude of the ground motion, and friction coefficient of the surfaces on the peak responsees under seven earthquakes. It is demonstrated that tri-linear DCFP bearings, in comparison with bi-linear bearings, can decrease the base shear up to about 48 percent. However, tri-linear DCFP bearings cause bigger displacements of sliding surfaces than bi-linear ones that reach to 57 %...|$|R

Synchronization is {{a phenomenon}} that is widely encountered in nature, life sciences and engineering. There exist various synchronization definitions in various research fields. The general definition for synchronization is the adjustment of rhythms of oscillating systems due to their weak interaction. Synchronization problem depends {{on the type of}} applications that require suitable properties and comparison functions. Different applications require different properties and comparison functions. Throughout our study, we choose the comparison function to be the difference of the states variables of the systems in hand. In this thesis, we will present types and methods of synchronization which has practical applications, i. e. mechanical systems. Then, we will investigate the passive controlled in-phase synchronization of spring-damper coupled single and double <b>pendulum</b> <b>systems</b> by using various stability analysis for both the system in hand and its appropriately defined error dynamics.
