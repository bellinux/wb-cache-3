30|$|Space {{is filled}} with dilute plasmas that are {{essentially}} collisionless. In collisionless plasmas, particles exchange their kinetic energies through <b>plasma</b> <b>waves.</b> This is addressed as wave-particle interactions. Wave-particle interactions control electromagnetic environments in space. Thus, since <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> reflect changes of electromagnetic environment in space, the observation of <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> is essential in monitoring the space electromagnetic environment, {{as well as for}} understanding physical processes taking place. Consequently, <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> have been observed in the past scientific missions that target the investigation of space plasma phenomena.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 90 - 91) The {{relatively new}} field involving excitation of electromagnetic surface <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> by {{the method of}} attenuated total reflection is described. Dispersion relations for surface <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> are derived, as are the Fresnel coefficients for magnetic thin films. It is shown how surface <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> produce an enhancement of the Kerr magneto-optic effect {{as well as an}} enhancement of second harmonic generation in metallic thin films. Surface <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> also produce a minor enhancement of the second harmonic, or non-linear, Kerr magneto-optic effect.

We find that for laser and plasma conditions of possible relevance to experiments at the National Ignition Facility (NIF), anomalously energetic electrons can be produced through the interaction of a discrete spectrum of <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> generated from SRS (back and forward scatter), rescatter, and the Langmuir decay of the rescatter-generated <b>plasma</b> <b>waves.</b> Electrons are bootstrapped in energy as they propagate into <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> with progressively higher phase velocities...|$|R
25|$|The two-stream {{instability}} is a {{very common}} instability in plasma physics. It can be induced by an energetic particle stream injected in a plasma, or setting a current along the plasma so different species (ions and electrons) can have different drift velocities.

Telemetry from the communications antenna and other special transmitters (an S-band transmitter and a dual-frequency Ka-band system) was also used to make observations of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and to measure the gravity fields of the planet and its satellites.|$|E

Although JMO never left the conception phase, ISAS scientists will see their instruments reaching Jupiter on the ESA-led JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer) mission. JUICE is a reformulation of the ESA Ganymede orbiter from the Laplace project. JAXA's contribution includes providing components of the RPWI (Radio & <b>Plasma</b> <b>Wave</b> Investigation), PEP (Particle Environment Package), GALA (GAnymede Laser Altimeter) instruments.|$|E

40|$|Research {{supported}} by this grant {{is divided into}} three basic topics of investigation. These are: (1) <b>Plasma</b> <b>waves</b> in the Venus magnetosheath, (2) <b>Plasma</b> <b>waves</b> in the Venus foreshock and solar wind, (3) <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> in the Venus nightside ionosphere and ionotail. The main issues addressed in the first area - <b>Plasma</b> <b>waves</b> in the Venus magnetosheath - dealt with the wave modes observed in the magnetosheath and upper ionosphere, and whether these waves are a significant source of heating for the topside ionosphere. The source of the waves was also investigated. In the second area - <b>Plasma</b> <b>waves</b> in the Venus foreshock and solar wind, we carried out some research on waves observed upstream of the planetary bow shock known as the foreshock. The foreshock and bow shock modify the ambient magnetic field and plasma, and need to be understood if we are to understand the magnetosheath. Although most of the research was directed to wave observations on the dayside of the planet, in the last of the three basic areas studied, we also analyzed data from the nightside. The <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> observed by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter on the nightside continue to be of considerable interest since they have been cited as evidence for lightning on Venus...|$|R
40|$|Many {{applications}} in photonics require all-optical manipulation of <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> 1, which can concentrate electromagnetic energy on sub-wavelength length scales. This is difficult in metallic plasmas {{because of their}} small optical nonlinearities. Some layered superconductors support Josephson <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> 2, 3, involving oscillatory tunnelling of the superfluid between capacitively coupled planes. Josephson <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> are also highly nonlinear 4, and exhibit striking phenomena such as cooperative emission of coherent terahertz radiation 5, 6, superconductor–metal oscillations 7 and soliton formation 8. Here, we show that terahertz Josephson <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> can be parametrically amplified through the cubic tunnelling nonlinearity in a cuprate superconductor. Parametric amplification is sensitive to the relative phase between pump and seed waves, and may be optimized to achieve squeezing of the order-parameter phase fluctuations 9 or terahertz single-photon devices...|$|R
