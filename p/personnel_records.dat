5|$|From a {{study of}} all the {{information}} available to the Board it is concluded that this flight crew was not capable of performing the function or assuming {{the responsibility for the}} job they presumed to do. The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have been aware of the manner in which company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. The manner in which maintenance and <b>personnel</b> <b>records</b> were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, the Kansas District Court {{granted a}} {{petition}} from Manning for a legal name change. An Army spokesman stated {{that while the}} Army would update <b>personnel</b> <b>records</b> to acknowledge the name change, the military would continue to regard Manning as a male. Manning sought hormone therapy {{and the right to}} live as a woman while confined, consistent with her gender dysphoria, which had been confirmed by two Army medical specialists. Such treatment is provided in civilian federal prisons when it is found to be medically necessary, but it is not available in military prisons. The Pentagon policy at the time considered transgender individuals ineligible to serve.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September 1944, Göth was {{relieved}} {{of his position}} and charged by the SS with theft of Jewish property (which belonged to the state, according to Nazi legislation), failure to provide adequate food to the prisoners under his charge, violation of concentration camp regulations regarding the treatment and punishment of prisoners, and allowing unauthorised access to camp <b>personnel</b> <b>records</b> by prisoners and non-commissioned officers. Administration of the camp at Płaszów {{was turned over to}} SS-Obersturmführer Arnold Büscher. Göth was scheduled for an appearance before SS judge Georg Konrad Morgen, but due to the progress of World War II and Germany's looming defeat, the charges against him were dropped in early 1945. SS doctors diagnosed Göth as suffering from mental illness, and he was committed to a mental institution in Bad Tölz, where he was arrested by the United States military in May 1945.|$|E

Success brought about from the process of record keeping at OUT were ranked medium, level identified were availability of information, easy retrieval of information and help in facilitating decision making. However 72 % of the respondents said that there is no effective data base at OUT hence clarify inefficiency to accurate records. Several challenges were identified including poor working environments, lack of personal record policy, lack of integrity, lose of documents/file and poor communication system. Generally the study shows that <b>personnel</b> <b>record</b> keeping is very important in decision making therefore OUT management needs to take measure to improve <b>personnel</b> <b>record</b> keeping infrastructure and develop <b>personnel</b> <b>record</b> management policy...|$|R

5|$|Survivors {{who took}} shelter in basements or cornfields, {{as well as}} a {{captured}} member of the paramilitary forces, later testified about the killings and identified the White Eagles as the perpetrators. In addition, the withdrawing paramilitaries left critical evidence behind, including <b>personnel</b> <b>records,</b> which confirmed that the force had been White Eagles associated with Šešelj. An American war crimes investigator for the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Special Agent John Cencich, corroborated the information in an interview with a high-level inside witness linking Slobodan Milošević, then president of Serbia to the killings. The ICTY charged Milošević with the deaths of 32 civilians in Voćin. Milošević was subsequently arrested and tried, but he died before his trial was completed. The ICTY also charged Šešelj with involvement in the forced deportation of non-Serb civilians from Voćin. Šešelj was ultimately acquitted of all charges.|$|E
5|$|The first crews {{arrived at}} Subic Bay on 11 June and a {{squadron}} office was established. On 12 June 1965, the squadron {{came under the}} operational control of the commander, Vietnam Patrol Force (CTF 71). Administrative control for personnel actions such as pay and <b>personnel</b> <b>records</b> was retained by the Coast Guard. The first cutters arrived at Subic Bay on 17 June and before they were put in the water each hull bottom was inspected, repaired if necessary and painted from the waterline down. Mechanical, ordnance, electrical and electronic maintenance checks were completed before any modifications for duty in Vietnam were attempted. Modifications completed at Subic Bay included new radio transceivers, fabrication of gunner's platforms and ammunition ready boxes for the mortar, the addition of floodlights for night boardings, installation of small arms lockers on the mess deck and addition of sound-powered telephone circuits. Additional bunks and refrigerators were added to increase patrol on-station time. Modifications {{were made to the}} bow-mounted over-under machine gun mortar combination allowing it to be depressed below the horizon for close-range firing. Four additional M-2 machine guns with ready boxes were added to the gunwales of each cutter.|$|E

25|$|Nathan Shefferman {{published}} The Man in the Middle, a 292-page {{account of}} his union busting activities, in 1961. Shefferman described {{a long list of}} practices which he viewed as tangential to union avoidance activities but which his detractors have labeled as support operations for these activities. Among these were the administration of opinion surveys, supervisor training, employee roundtables, incentive pay procedures, wage surveys, employee complaint procedures, <b>personnel</b> <b>records,</b> application procedures, job evaluations, and legal services. As part of his union busting strategies, all of these activities were performed with the goal of maintaining complete control of the work force by top management. Shefferman's book not only provided the concepts that animated all future union busting techniques, he also provided language that pro-labor supporters believe mask the intent of the policies.|$|E
25|$|In late 1966, the Central Intelligence Agency had human {{intelligence}} reports of three American {{prisoners of war}} being held in northern Laos. The names received matched American <b>personnel</b> <b>records.</b> However, the CIA seniors contemplated an attempt to bribe prison guards that spooked the communists; the prisoners were relocated. In early December 1966, a Pathet Lao defector {{was brought in to}} Thakhek, Laos by a CIA military intelligence team that was watching the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Under interrogation, the defector told of a prison camp in a cave near the Lao village of Ban Naden. It purportedly contained a captive Air America employee. In a year of picking up vague reports about this camp, this was the first detailed information. Debriefing elicited the information that there were about 40 guards at the camp, and about the same number of prisoners to be rescued.|$|E

Bolling was promoted to colonel and his duties were a continuation of those under Mitchell: the supervision of training, the administration of <b>personnel</b> <b>records,</b> the operation of Air Service lines of communication (supply), {{the activities of the}} Balloon Division, and the establishment of training schools and air depots for equipment and repair. The most important sections of his new office were those which performed flying training, all balloon activities, and aerial photography units. One of his first tasks was the accelerated construction of a large flying school at Issoudun to provide advanced training to cadets completing their preliminary instruction in France, as he had earlier recommended.|$|E
