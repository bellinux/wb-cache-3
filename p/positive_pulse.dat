5000|$|A krytron {{has four}} electrodes. Two are a {{conventional}} anode and cathode. One is a keep-alive electrode, arranged {{to be close}} to the cathode. The keep-alive has a low positive voltage applied, which causes a small area of gas to ionize near the cathode. High voltage is applied to the anode, but primary conduction does not occur until a <b>positive</b> <b>pulse</b> is applied to the trigger electrode ("Grid" [...] in the image above).

40|$|The large-amplitude {{radiation}} field pulses produced by intracloud lightning discharge processes {{have been recorded}} with submicrosecond time resolution. The wave forms are distinctly different from those produced by return strokes in cloud-to-ground lightning, yet they are surprisingly alike within a discharge and in different discharges.

Once SCR starts conducting, no more gate voltage is required to maintain it in the on state. There {{are two ways to}} turn it off: 1. Reduce the current through it below a minimum value called the holding current and 2.

50|$|This is {{the most}} common method of data {{transmission}} used by MWD tools. Downhole, a valve is operated to restrict the flow of the drilling fluid (Mud) according to the digital information to be transmitted. This creates pressure fluctuations representing the information. The pressure fluctuations propagate within the drilling fluid towards the surface where they are received from pressure sensors. On the surface, the received pressure signals are processed by computers to reconstruct the information. The technology is available in three varieties: <b>positive</b> <b>pulse,</b> negative pulse, and continuous wave.|$|E
50|$|The FLP burst {{consists}} of 17 NLP at a 125 µs time interval (with a tolerance of 14 µs). Between {{each pair of}} two consecutive NLP (i.e. at 62.5 µs after first NLP of the pulse pair) an additional <b>positive</b> <b>pulse</b> may be present. The presence of this additional pulse indicates a logical 1, its absence a logical 0. As a result, every FLP contains a data word of 16 bits. This data word is called a link code word (LCW). The bits of the link code word are numbered from 0 to 15, where bit 0 corresponds to the first possible pulse in time and bit 15 to the last.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{analysis}} to the signal, the received signal can be roughly {{divided into three}} parts: strong direct current part, weak low-frequency part (0.5 to 1.2 Hz) and high-frequency noise. The direct current component corresponds to the drilling fluid pressure at the measure point, which is much stronger (1400 to 4000 mV) than the low-frequency component (10 to 200 mV) {{that comes from the}} down-hole combined signal from which important parameters would be gained, and the high-frequency noise is more complicated. The pump noise is the main source of the noise during the signal transmission. In addition, {{it is worth noting that}} the low-frequency component is composed of <b>positive</b> <b>pulses.</b>|$|R

This results in faster recovery of the medium, making it possible to overdrive the chaos by generating waves with frequency higher than that possible with only <b>positive</b> <b>pulses.</b> This provides the simplest and most general understanding of the effectiveness of biphasic stimulation in controlling fibrillation and allows designing optimal waveshapes for controlling spatiotemporal chaos.

Four Marx generators are used, {{each of the}} two electrodes of the Pockels cell being connected to a <b>positive</b> <b>pulse</b> generator and a negative pulse generator. Two generators of opposite polarity, one on each electrode, are first fired to charge the Pockels cell into one polarity. This will also partly charge the other two generators but not trigger them, because they have been only partly charged beforehand. Leakage through the Marx resistors needs to be compensated by a small bias current through the generator. At the trailing edge of the boxcar, the two other generators are fired to [...] "reverse" [...] the cell.|$|E

40|$|The {{excitation}} {{and evolution}} of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) solitons in a dusty plasma medium are studied using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The dusty plasma medium is modelled {{as a collection of}} dust particles interacting through Yukawa potential, which takes into account dust charge screening due to the lighter electron and ion species. The collective response of such screened dust particles to an applied electric field impulse is studied here. An excitation of a perturbed <b>positive</b> density <b>pulse</b> propagating in one direction along with a train of negative perturbed rarefactive density oscillations in the opposite direction is observed. These observations are in accordance with evolution governed by the KdV equation. Detailed studies of (a) amplitude vs. width variation of the observed pulse, (b) the emergence of intact separate pulses with an associated phase shift after collisional interaction amidst them, etc., conclusively qualify the <b>positive</b> <b>pulses</b> observed in the simulations as KdV solitons. It is also observed that by increasing the strength of the electric field impulse, multiple solitonic structures get excited. The excitations of the multiple solitons are similar to the experimental observations reported recently by Boruah et al. [Phys. Plasmas 23, 093704 (2016) ] for dusty plasmas.

40|$|Coseismic {{disturbances}} in ionosphere {{have been observed}} after recent thrust earthquakes off the Pacific coast of Japan, with a dense Global Positioning System array. <b>Positive</b> <b>pulses</b> in electron content, as large as several times 10 (15) electrons/m(2) {{and as long as}} 4 - 5 min, emerge similar to 10 min after earthquakes and propagate horizontally with apparent velocity of similar to 1 km/s, close to the sound velocity at the ionospheric height. They may have been excited by coseismic uplifts of the sea surface initially as upward propagating compressive pulses of atmosphere, which were gradually refracted to propagate horizontally in ionosphere. The propagation has strong north-south asymmetry, and interaction between the movements of charged particles in acoustic waves and geomagnetic fields might have selectively attenuated the northward propagating disturbances.

40|$|Electrostatic {{production}} of low frequency (about 1 Hz) acoustic pulses associated with electrical discharges in thunderclouds has been theoretically described (e. g., Wilson, 1920; Dessler, 1973) and experimentally observed (e. g., Bohannon et al., 1977; Balachandran, 1983). The measured waveforms differ consistently with the theories {{in that the}} observed wave has an initial positive (or condensation) pulse followed by a negative (or rarefaction) pulse; whereas theories predicted only a negative pulse. The electrical heating of the air by positive streamer systems during the discharge is computed in this theoretical paper. This rapid (supersonic) electrical heating, although small (about 10 to the - 6 th T sub zero), produces a positive pressure perturbation (of about 10 to the - 1 st Pa), which when added to the negative electrostatic pressure perturbation generates an acoustic wave consistent with measured signals. A <b>positive</b> <b>pulse</b> always precedes the negative pulse in this model, and the <b>positive</b> <b>pulse</b> is always smaller in amplitude than the negative.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{commercially pure}} {{titanium}} (Cp-Ti) was micro arc oxidized in an alkaline solution {{by using a}} bipolar power supply capable of applying square voltage pulses.

In characterization works, X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), coating thickness measurements and surface roughness measurements were employed. Results generally showed that coating thickness and surface roughness greatly depend on the voltage level in that higher voltage levels give thicker coatings and rougher surfaces. When the number of successive <b>positive</b> voltage <b>pulses</b> is increased, more uniform surface appearance with well distributed and equal sized micro pores are obtained up to 400 V of positive voltage.
