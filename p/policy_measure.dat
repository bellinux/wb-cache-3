25|$|After the 1971 war, Bhutto {{launched}} a much serious <b>policy</b> <b>measure</b> programme in 1971, called nationalization programme. Under this programme, all major liberalised industries came under intense government-ownership management where majority of industries were vertically integrated. Under limited five {{year of his}} government, the public and government sector expanded greatly, and government investment grew each and every year to boost {{the function of the}} industries. An extreme level of left-wing but nationalist economics reforms were introduced by Bhutto to raise the economic revenue of the government sector while curbing down the liberalise private-sector.|$|E
40|$|Past {{and present}} <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> to stimulate energy savings in the {{household}} sector in EU- 15 countries are analysed as to their type (regulatory, financial, information, etc.) their coverage {{of different types of}} energy use and their estimated impact on energy consumption. Moreover, the matching of national and EU-based <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> is looked at. Finally, a number of innovative <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> are presented. This analysis comprises over 310 <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> presently available for the residential sector in the MURE-database sponsored by the European Commission. On the basis of these results and a theory on effective implementation of saving <b>measures</b> using <b>policy</b> <b>measures,</b> tentative conclusions are drawn on the amount and composition of <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> in EU-countries, the role EU-policy can or should play and the effectiveness of the sets of <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> in EU-countries...|$|R

25|$|The Privatization {{process in}} Pakistan (sometimes {{referred}} to as Denationalization programme or simply the Privatization in Pakistan) was a <b>policy</b> <b>measure</b> programme in the economic period of Pakistan. It was first conceived and implemented by the then-people-elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the Pakistan Muslim League, {{in an attempt to}} enable the nationalized industries towards market economy, immediately after the economic collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989–90. The program was envisaged and visioned to improve the GDP growth of the national economy of Pakistan, and reversal of the nationalization programme in 1970s— an inverse of the privatization programme.|$|E
25|$|Brazil {{received}} an International Monetary Fund rescue package in mid-2002 of $30.4billion, then a record sum. Brazil's central bank paid back the IMF loan in 2005, {{although it was}} not due to be repaid until 2006. One of the issues the Central Bank of Brazil recently dealt with was an excess of speculative short-term capital inflows to the country, which may have contributed to a fall {{in the value of the}} U.S. dollar against the real during that period. Nonetheless, foreign direct investment (FDI), related to long-term, less speculative investment in production, is estimated to be $193.8billion for 2007. Inflation monitoring and control currently plays a major part in the Central bank's role of setting out short-term interest rates as a monetary <b>policy</b> <b>measure.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to societal demands, the Dutch government implemented <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> {{to reduce the}} use of fossil energy in greenhouse horticulture. A survey {{study was conducted to}} analyse behavioural aspects of horticultural growers to see 1) if they know about the <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> and know what they mean for their own firm; 2) if they are willing to behave accordingly, and 3) whether we can explain different behavioural responses to the <b>policy</b> <b>measures.</b> Semi-structured interviews were conducted on 95 specialised greenhouse firms and the interview data was combined with existing firm records on technical and economic results, energy-saving investments and energy use. A cluster analysis was executed to reveal differences between growers with respect to the <b>policy</b> <b>measures.</b> Five clusters were identified that could be distinguished by the gap between their current energy use and the required energy-use level as determined by the <b>policy</b> <b>measures.</b> Perception, attitude and behaviour with respect to energy saving varied considerably among the different clusters. Limited knowledge of <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> appeared to be no explanatory factor: firms that have to make large adjustments to comply with <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> were quite well aware of the <b>policy</b> <b>measures.</b> Either a `wait-and-see¿ strategy or a strict focus on consumer demands has kept them from changing their energy-related behaviour so far.

Knowledge about determinants and interrelations between attitudes {{held by the}} general public to different types of <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> can benefit policy-makers who aim to increase acceptance for effective policy. The present study describes the level of support for various <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> held {{by the general public}}, and investigates the association between attitudes to <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> on alcohol, tobacco and illegal drug.

Associations between attitudes were strongest for similar <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> across substance groups (e. g. tax increases on alcohol and tobacco). There was a weaker association between attitudes to different <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> aimed at the same substance (e. g. tax increase on alcohol and campaigns on alcohol).

Since the 1950s, the country had undergone a speedy industrialisation and became an industrial paradise in Asia. But, as time progressed, the labour trade unions and labour-working class had increasingly strained relations with the industrial business oligarch class, having neglected to improve working conditions and failing to provide a healthy and safe environment for the workers in these industrial industries.|$|E

40|$|To abate {{problems}} {{resulting from}} increased car use, hard transport <b>policy</b> <b>measures</b> have been introduced.
