5|$|Making {{matters worse}} for the defenders, any {{aircraft}} that braved the weather and attempted to land was subject to North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire on its way in for a landing. Once the aircraft touched down, it became the target of any number of NVA artillery or mortar crews. The aircrew then {{had to contend with}} anti-aircraft fire on the way out. As a result, 65 percent of all supplies were delivered by paradrops delivered by C-130 aircraft, mostly by the US Air Force, whose crews had significantly more experience in airdrop tactics than Marine air crews. The most dramatic supply delivery system used at Khe Sanh was the Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System (LAPES), in which <b>palletized</b> supplies were pulled out of the cargo bay of a low-flying transport aircraft by means of an attached parachute. The pallet slid to a halt on the airstrip while the aircraft never had to actually land. The US Air Force delivered 14,356 tons of supplies to Khe Sanh by air (8,120 tons by paradrop). 1st Marine Aircraft Wing records claim that the unit delivered 4,661 tons of cargo into KSCB.|$|E

50|$|<b>Palletizing</b> {{is one of}} {{the more}} popular {{applications}} for robots,and is accomplished by combining a series of commands into a <b>palletizing</b> routine. A RoboLogix <b>palletizing</b> routine consists of five program instructions, or lines. The first instruction is the <b>Palletize</b> instruction, which is followed by a linear motion instruction to move to the stack point. The stack point is the top-center of the workpiece, and a group of stack points forms a stacking pattern, as shown in the adjacent image. The first stack point in a stacking pattern is located at (1,1,1) (row,column, layer) and is incremented each time the <b>palletizing</b> routine is executed.|$|R

25|$|During {{the early}} part of 1965 about one dozen {{personnel}} of the 109th Quartermaster Corps, U.S. Army, were sent TDY to Eglin Air Force Base, where they assisted Air Force personnel developing an air delivery technique called the low-altitude parachute extraction system (LAPES). The 109th's mission was to provide parachute packing, temporary storage and rigging of supplies and equipment for aerial drop by aircraft of all the services. In addition, the 109th was to render technical assistance in the recovery and evacuation of airdrop equipment. Using the LAPES system, while a cargo plane flew a few feet above ground level, a drogue parachute would be released, pulling <b>palletized</b> cargo out of the aircraft and onto the drop zone. An alternative method was the ground proximity extraction system (GPES), in which cargo was yanked from the aircraft by a hook that snagged a cable traversing the runway. At full strength the unit would be capable of preparing 200 tons of material per day for delivery by free, high velocity or low-velocity drop techniques.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: 4 -DOF (Four {{degrees of}} freedom) <b>palletizing</b> robot {{is widely used}} in our country, which is playing a more and more {{important}} role in the logistics automation. The important indicators of ER 300 <b>palletizing</b> robot performances include strength, stiffness, and ER 300 <b>palletizing</b> robot weight, which mainly depend on the structural design of ER 300 palletiz-ing robot. So it is of importance to research on the structural optimization design by means of finite element analysis (FEA), ADMAS and Matlab. In this paper, the framework of structural optimization design is proposed. Secondly, taking ER 300 <b>palletizing</b> robot as research object, its structure is described and the finite element (FE) model of the <b>palletizing</b> robot is developed for the finite element analysis. Thirdly, to ensure the reliability {{of the results of the}} analysis, stress and strain experiment is carried out to validate the analysis results. Finally, the structural optimization design of major parts has been completed. The results show that structural optimization design can reduce total mass of ER 300 <b>palletizing</b> robot greatly by using the finite element analysis and optimization technology premised on the design requirements of palletiz-ing robot such as stiffness, strength and so on, thus the structural optimization design can be achieved...|$|R

The whole system consists of a two meter parcel-buffer in front of the industrial robot (ABB IRB 6000), a robot control unit, a vision system to detect the parcels dimensions, a new developed gripper system and a PC serving as cell controler. The system can therefore substitute any manual <b>palletizing</b> station. The most important part to maintained is the fast on-line <b>palletizing</b> algorithm and the flexible gripper system.

2500|$|In 1970, Boeing {{received}} only 37 orders. Facing financial difficulties, Boeing considered closing the 737 production-line and selling the design to Japanese aviation companies. After {{the cancellation of}} the Boeing Supersonic Transport, and scaling back of 747 production, enough funds were freed up to continue the project. [...] In a bid to increase sales by offering a variety of options, Boeing offered a 737C (Convertible) model in both -100 and -200 lengths. This model featured a [...] freight door just behind the cockpit, and a strengthened floor with rollers, which allowed for <b>palletized</b> cargo. A 737QC (Quick Change) version with <b>palletized</b> seating allowed for faster configuration changes between cargo and passenger flights. With the improved short-field capabilities of the 737, Boeing offered the option on the -200 of the gravel kit, which enables this aircraft to operate on remote, unpaved runways. Until retiring its -200 fleet in 2007, Alaska Airlines used this option for some of its rural operations in Alaska. Northern Canadian operators Air Inuit, Air North, Canadian North, First Air and Nolinor Aviation still operate the gravel kit aircraft in Northern Canada, where gravel runways are common.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Modern <b>palletizing</b> {{systems are}} {{designed}} mainly for performance and flexibility. In today’s competitive scenario, {{the cost of}} <b>palletizing</b> system,its installation lead time and its proper integration with material transport system present inside the plant are the factors of major concern for any industrial engineer. At {{the same time the}} system he designs, should be flexible enough to accommodate some basic anticipated changes with minimum setup time. Industrial Robots and Automated Inline Palletizers are widely used in industries for the <b>palletizing</b> operation. But neither of these provides a complete solution. Eg Automated Inline Palletizers are fast enough but cannot handle situations involving 1. drastic changes in carton sizes and 2. different pallet layer configurations. It is because of lack of programmability. On the contrary, robots are programmable but consumes programming downtime. The present paper proposes a model of an entire <b>palletizing</b> cell which is not only cost effective, but also flexible enough to accommodate frequent changes in sizes of cartons with almost negligible setup time and therefore negligible downtime. The paper describes the schematic configuration of proposed model as well as it explains how this model conquers the limitations of present available <b>palletizing</b> facilities mentioned above...|$|R
