5|$|In {{addition}} to constitutional powers, governors {{also have a}} considerable degree of statutory authority. Most of the authority exercised by governors {{on a daily basis}} is derived from statute, giving the General Assembly a great degree of power to expand or contract the governor's authority. Historically, the party in control of the General Assembly would reassign control of agencies from the governor or to the governor based his <b>party</b> <b>affiliation,</b> and the <b>party</b> <b>affiliation</b> of the cabinet heads, which at times has left the governor with no direct control over state agencies.|$|E

5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his <b>party</b> <b>affiliation</b> from Democrat to Republican, citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his <b>party</b> <b>affiliation.</b> Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Nauru {{does not}} have any formal {{structure}} for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First, and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties rather than <b>party</b> <b>affiliation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Specific {{elements}} were popular {{across the political}} spectrum, while others, such as the mandate to purchase insurance, were widely disliked. In a 2012 poll 44% supported the law, with 56% against. By <b>party</b> <b>affiliation,</b> 75% of Democrats, 27% of Independents and 14% of Republicans favored the law overall. 82% favored banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, 61% favored allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, 72% supported requiring companies with more than 50 employees to provide insurance for their employees, and 39% supported the individual mandate to own insurance or pay a penalty. By <b>party</b> <b>affiliation,</b> 19% of Republicans, 27% of Independents, and 59% of Democrats favored the mandate. Other polls showed additional provisions receiving majority support, including the creation of insurance exchanges, pooling small businesses and the uninsured with other consumers so that more people {{can take advantage of}} large group pricing benefits and providing subsidies to individuals and families to make health insurance more affordable.|$|E

5|$|A Democrat in a Whig district, Powell's {{political}} career {{began with an}} 1836 bid for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. He campaigned vigorously while his opponent, John G. Holloway, relied largely on his <b>party</b> <b>affiliation</b> to carry the election. This proved a critical misstep for Holloway, as Powell secured the surprise victory. Holloway apparently learned from his mistake. Upon the completion of Powell's term in 1838, Holloway challenged Powell again, and defeated him by a considerable majority. Six year later, Powell was chosen as a presidential elector on the Democratic ticket, supporting James K. Polk.|$|E

According to conventional expectations, politicians 2 ̆ 019 <b>party</b> <b>affiliations</b> should influence political representation {{when they are}} elected under a proportional system.

5|$|Samuel {{did not run}} for {{re-election}} as mayor, leaving an open seat to be contested by the Republican nominee, Daniel A. Poling, and the Democrat, Joseph S. Clark, Jr. Clark was a lawyer and United States Army officer who had served in World War II. Raised in an upper-class Republican family, he switched his <b>party</b> <b>affiliation</b> to the Democrats in 1928. After several unsuccessful attempts at public office in Philadelphia, {{he served as a}} Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania. Clark was known as a reformer, having been elected city controller two years earlier in 1949 on a platform of cleaning up corruption in the city. Despite being slandered as a communist for his membership in the Americans for Democratic Action, a left-wing group, Clark was victorious.|$|E
5|$|In 1852 Morton campaigned and {{was elected}} {{to serve as a}} circuit court judge, but {{resigned}} after only a year; he found that he preferred to practice law. By 1854 he was active in Indiana politics. Initially, Morton was an anti-slavery Democrat, but living in a region dominated by the Whig Party he had little hope of furthering a political career without changing his <b>party</b> <b>affiliation.</b> Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which repealed the Missouri Compromise's ban on slavery in the western territories, beyond Missouri, had a divisive effect on both parties. As the Democrats divided over the issue, Morton took a stand with the Free Soil supporters and opposed the Act. Under the influence of U.S. Senator Jesse D. Bright, the state's Democrats expel its anti-slavery members, including Morton, from the Indiana state convention in 1854. That same year Morton joined with other political factions to form the People's party, the forerunner to the state's Republican party.|$|E
5|$|Khánh {{selected}} a cabinet of thirteen ministers and two Secretaries of State at ministerial level, and chose new provincial and district chiefs. He originally tried to include {{members of a}} variety of political and religious groups including representatives of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo sects, who still had remnants of their private armies intact after their defeat by Diệm in 1955. Although Khánh insisted that he had no <b>party</b> <b>affiliation,</b> the orientation of his government was toward the Đại Việt, who held many of the key posts in the government. This provoked bitterness from other anti-communist nationalists and groups that were banned under Diệm and were seeking a greater role in public life, as well as from a younger generation who felt that the established nationalist parties were responsible for dividing the people.|$|E

5|$|The Provincial Assembly of Rio Grande do Sul {{was closed}} in 1837, and no {{elections}} were held {{because of the}} Ragamuffin rebellion. In 1845, Marques de Sousa ran and was elected as provincial deputy in the legislature that met in 1846, though he had no <b>party</b> <b>affiliation.</b> He married Maria Balbina Álvares da Gama, daughter of José Gama Lobo de Eça (later Baron of Saicã), on 28 November 1846. The couple's only child, Maria Manuela da Gama Marques, was born {{less than a year}} and a half later. Marques de Sousa was made brevet brigadier on 14 March 1847, and the 2nd Cavalry Brigade was placed under his command (until April 1848). He was later confirmed in the rank of brigadier on 14 August 1850. On 11 June 1851, his wife died in childbirth (aged 29), leaving him with a three-year-old daughter.|$|E
5|$|Bevin {{was sworn}} into a {{four-year}} term as Kentucky Governor on December 8, 2015. Observers {{from both parties}} praised Bevin's selection of experienced, relatively moderate individuals for his cabinet, including his former rival, Hal Heiner, as Secretary of the Education and Workforce Cabinet and former University of Kentucky football standout Derrick Ramsey as his Secretary of Labor. The appointments of two Democratic state representatives– John Tilley as Secretary of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and Tanya Pullin to a state judgeship– reduced the party's majority in the House and set up special elections that gave Republicans {{a chance to win}} their seats from Democrats. Bevin set the dates of the special elections to fill the seats of Tilley and Pullin, as well as those formerly held by newly elected Auditor Mike Harmon and newly elected Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, for March 8, 2016. Democratic representatives Denver Butler and Jim Gooch also switched their <b>party</b> <b>affiliation</b> to Republican in December, reducing the Democratic majority to 50–46 for the beginning of the first General Assembly of Bevin's governorship, and giving Republicans a chance to evenly split the chamber's 100 seats by sweeping the special elections. Republicans held only Harmon's seat, giving Democrats a 53–47 advantage in the House {{for the remainder of the}} session.|$|E
