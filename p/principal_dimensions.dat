25|$|The {{linguistic}} {{varieties of}} Modern Greek {{can be classified}} along two <b>principal</b> <b>dimensions.</b> First, {{there is a long}} tradition of sociolectal variation between the natural, popular spoken language {{on the one hand and}} archaizing, learned written forms on the other.

The competition between the popular and the learned registers (see Diglossia), culminated in the struggle between Dimotiki (Demotic Greek) and Katharevousa during the 19th and 20th centuries. As for regional dialects, variation within the bulk of dialects of present-day Greece is not particularly strong, except for a number of outlying, highly divergent dialects spoken by isolated communities.|$|E

30|$|In this study, we {{proposed}} a novel unsupervised manifold learning framework to construct a state space, {{in the form of}} a manifold embedded in 2 -D that quasi-isometrically visualizes EEG connectome dynamics. Moreover, in this space one can visualize time-dependent brain activities as a trajectory or Thought Chart. Using the temporal dynamic EEG connectome, two neighborhood construction algorithms are applied to visualize the state space in 2 -D. Both k-isomap and ε-isomap are able to compose a highly dynamic and complex geometry, where distinct subregions are distributed along the principle dimension (x-axis in the 2 -D space). The baseline resting state is concentrated on one end, followed by mostly Neutral points that can be observed later along the x-axis, while Maintain and Reappraise are mixed, from the posterior section on to the end. Note that this transition corresponds to different mental states, suggesting that the manifold has a <b>principal</b> <b>dimension</b> that is primarily linear, and a vertical motion around this <b>principal</b> <b>dimension</b> whose amplitude increases with cognitive demands. In this context, this manifold may resemble dynamical systems on a torus [22] (the surface of a doughnut), in that trajectories are generated by the product of distribution along the <b>principal</b> <b>dimension</b> and a minor up–down motion in the second dimension.|$|R

Previous studies have shown that perceived roughness is not based on neural activity in the Pacinian or cutaneous slowly adapting type II (SAII) neural responses or on mean impulse rate or temporal patterning in the cutaneous slowly adapting type I (SAI) or rapidly adapting (RA) discharge evoked by a textured surface. However, those studies found very high correlations between roughness scaling by humans and measures of spatial variation in SAI and RA firing rates. The present study used textured surfaces composed of dots of varying height (280 – 620 mm) and diameter (0. 25 – 2. 5 mm) in psychophysical and neuro-physiological experiments.

40|$|Existing {{analyses}} of the Turkish party system {{suggest that it is}} unique in several respects. Upper-class voters tend to support the Republican People’s Party (CHP), the centre-left social democratic party, while poorer voters support the right. Unlike party systems in Western democracies, expert surveys find that a religious–secular divide, and not a socio-economic divide, best explains the general left–right dimension. Qualitative literature stresses Turkey’s uniqueness due to the long history of the CHP, its close ties to the bureaucracy and military, {{and the role of the}} military in politics. Lastly, existing quantitative measures of policy positions disagree about the placement of major parties.

Since this study was commissioned for the ultimate purpose of determining hazards to landing spacecraft, such a definition was deemed appropriate in defining block-related hazards associated with craters.
