25|$|Modern {{personal}} computers have encouraged {{the use of}} digital modes such as radioteletype (RTTY) which previously required cumbersome mechanical equipment. Hams led the development of <b>packet</b> <b>radio</b> in the 1970s, which has employed protocols such as AX.25 and TCP/IP. Specialized digital modes such as PSK31 allow real-time, low-power communications on the shortwave bands. EchoLink using Voice over IP technology has enabled amateurs to communicate through local Internet-connected repeaters and radio nodes, while IRLP has allowed the linking of repeaters to provide greater coverage area. Automatic link establishment (ALE) has enabled continuous amateur radio networks to operate on the high frequency bands with global coverage. Other modes, such as FSK441 using software such as WSJT, are used for weak signal modes including meteor scatter and moonbounce communications.|$|E

5000|$|First, {{from the}} routing information, the sending radio {{constructs}} {{a list of}} radios that {{might be able to}} forward data from the sending radio to the destination. The radios' numbers are placed in a list sorted by distance to the destination, from closest to furthest. The destination radio is {{at the head of the}} list. Also, the source radio starts a list of the packets in the batch in order to measure packets' progress. This [...] "batch map" [...] is an array of radio numbers, one per <b>packet.</b> Each <b>radio</b> number is the radio that transmitted that packet, and was closest to the destination <b>radio.</b> Each data <b>packet</b> has the list of <b>radios,</b> and <b>packets</b> placed in the front. The list saves space in each <b>packet</b> by using <b>radio</b> numbers rather than IP addresses. Then, the sending radio broadcasts the first batch of data packets. It starts a timer. Radios that receive a packet but are not in the list in the packet ignore the data <b>packets.</b> These <b>radios</b> throw away the packets as soon as the <b>packets</b> are received. <b>Radios</b> that are in the <b>packet's</b> list of <b>radios</b> save the data packets that they receive. They also update their batch map. When a radio times out, it transmits the <b>packets</b> that no <b>radio</b> closer to the destination has retransmitted. These <b>packets</b> include the <b>radio's</b> best available information about the progress of the packets in the batch (i.e. its batch map). In particular, each packet's batch map contains the retransmitter's radio number for each packet that it retransmits. When a <b>radio</b> receives a <b>packet</b> sent from a radio that is closer to the destination, it erases its own copy of that packet. There's no need for it to retransmit that packet. However, it also updates its batch map about the progress of the packets in the batch. In this way, the information about the progress of the packets flows backward toward the source as radios farther from the destination update their batch maps by eavesdropping on retransmissions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Energy {{conservation}} {{and reliability of}} wireless communications are two crucial requirements of practical sensor networks. Radio duty cycling is a widely used mechanism to reduce energy consumption of sensor devices and to increase the lifetime of the network. A side effect of radio duty cycling {{is that it can}} cause the wireless communications to be unreliable—if a sender node transmits a packet while the receiver is asleep, the communication fails. Early duty cycling protocols like B-MAC thatwere designedfor bitstreamingradios achieve low dutycycle by keeping the radio transceiver awake for short time periods. However, they require a transmitter node to precede a packet transmission with a long preamble to ensure the reliability of wireless communication. Furthermore, they cannot be used with modern <b>packet</b> <b>radios</b> likewidelyused IEEE 802. 15. 4 based radio transceivers, which cannot transmit arbitrarily long preambles. Recent duty cycling schemes like X-MAC, on the other hand, reduce the length of the preamble and are designed to work with <b>packet</b> <b>radios.</b> However, {{in order to ensure that}} a receiver can reliably detect a transmitter’s preamble transmission, these schemes need to turn the radio transceiver on for longer time durations than the early schemes like B-MAC. In this paper, we present a novel duty cycling scheme called QuickMAC, that achieves a very low duty cycle without compromising the reliability of wireless communication. Furthermore, QuickMAC is stateless, compatible with packet (and bit stream) radios, and does not require synchronization among sensor nodes. From our experiments using TMote sky motes, we show that QuickMAC reduces duty cycle by a factor of about 4 compared to X-MAC, and yet maintains the same level of reliability of wireless communication as X-MAC.
