5|$|Khalid {{argued that}} he had conquered the city by force. Abu Ubaidah {{maintained}} the city had capitulated, through the <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> between him and Thomas. The corps commanders discussed the situation, and reportedly told Khalid that the <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> must be honored. Their rationale had logic: if other Byzantines in Syria heard that the Muslims had given a guarantee of safety to a surrendered city and then had slaughtered those whose safety had been guaranteed, no other city would ever surrender to the Muslims. This would make the task of conquering Syria immeasurably more difficult. Khalid, though not happy, agreed to honor the <b>peace</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} the <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> were {{that no one would}} be enslaved, no harm would be done to the temples, nothing would be taken as booty and that safe passage was given to Thomas, Harbees, and every citizen of Damascus who was not willing to live under Muslim rule. The <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> also stated that the peace would end after three days and that the Muslims could attack after these three days without violating the agreement.|$|E

40|$|Attaining durable peace after a {{civil war}} {{has become a major}} challenge, as many {{negotiated}} settlements relapse into violence. How can civil war negotiations be conducted and <b>peace</b> <b>agreements</b> formulated so as to contribute to lasting, durable peace? Previous research has focused on the durability of <b>peace</b> <b>agreements,</b> measured as the absence of violence. This study develops an index to measure durable peace for a period of 8 years after the agreement had been reached, and evaluates the new measure using an existing data set. We ask whether impacts on durable peace are similar or different to those found for the durability of agreements. This question suggests a number of hypotheses that are evaluated with 16 cases of <b>peace</b> <b>agreements.</b> Stable agreements are shown to mediate the relationship between equality provisions in <b>peace</b> <b>agreements</b> and durable <b>peace,</b> and to also mediate the relationship between procedural justice and the reconciliation component of durable peace. Interestingly, economic stability is not a dividend of <b>peace</b> <b>agreements...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Peace</b> <b>agreements</b> are {{instrumental}} {{not only}} in ensuring that peace prevails but also in setting up a new relationship between conflicting parties. <b>Peace</b> <b>agreements</b> {{have proven to be}} an important tool for indigenous peoples and states in establishing new relationship. The numerous recent <b>peace</b> <b>agreements</b> signed between states and indigenous peoples have been instrumental in establishing an agenda for social justice and equality for indigenous peoples. The chapter analyses to what extent such <b>peace</b> <b>agreements</b> have been successful in establishing new relationships between governments and indigenous peoples, notably by looking at central issues of self-determination, land rights and cultural rights. As the chapters examines one of the limitations of the <b>peace</b> <b>agreements</b> is their lack of implementation by states’ governments and the lack of monitoring of the implementation by the international community. The chapters examine to what extent international bodies such as the International Labour Organisation or the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Bodies can {{play an important role in}} monitoring the implementation of such agreements...|$|R

The treaty did not prevent the Finnish government from allowing volunteers {{to cross the border}} to support the East-Karelian Uprising in 1921 however, nor expatriate Finnish communists from causing disturbances in Finland.

5|$|After being {{occupied}} with suppressing the revolt of Bardas Phokas {{throughout the year}} 970, Tzimiskes marshalled his forces in early 971 for a campaign against the Rus', moving his troops from Asia to Thrace and gathering supplies and siege equipment. The Byzantine navy accompanied the expedition, tasked with carrying troops to effect a landing in the enemy's rear and to cut off their retreat across the Danube. The emperor chose Easter week of 971 to make his move, catching the Rus' completely by surprise: The passes of the Balkan mountains had been left unguarded, either because the Rus' were busy suppressing Bulgarian revolts or perhaps (as A.D. Stokes suggests) because a <b>peace</b> <b>agreement</b> that had been concluded after the battle of Arcadiopolis made them complacent.|$|E

40|$|The {{adoption}} of Security Council resolution 1325 on women, {{peace and security}} in October 2000 {{marked the beginning of}} a global agenda on women in armed conflicts and post-conflict transition. Women, Peace and Security: Repositioning gender in <b>peace</b> <b>agreements</b> discusses the context and the content of this UN agenda and provides a systematic review of its implementation, over the last fifteen years, in <b>peace</b> <b>agreements</b> around the world. This book is timely, offering a valuable contribution to the literature on gender in armed conflicts, <b>peace</b> <b>agreements,</b> <b>peace</b> mediation, and transitional justice and is essential reading for practitioners and scholars working in this field. The study adopts an interdisciplinary approach to raise key theoretical and practical questions often overlooked by scholars working within the strict boundaries of the distinct disciplines. The book introduces a new dataset on <b>peace</b> <b>agreements</b> that provides important comprehensive evidence {{on the extent to which}} resolution 1325 and other subsequent resolutions on women, peace and security have impacted on <b>peace</b> <b>agreements.</b> Through the reflections of elite peacemakers, the book provides additional insights into the practice of peacemaking and the challenges of implementing the UN resolutions on women, peace and security on the ground. The findings of this book have important policy implications for governments, international organisations and NGOs who must refocus their efforts on bridging the gap between the theory and practice of gender sensitive peacemaking...|$|R

In July 2003, conditions had become so bad in Honiara that the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), consisting of multiple Pacific nations under Australian leadership, was invited into the country by the Solomons Government to restore order. In 2006, riots broke out following the election of Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying a part of Chinatown and making more than 1,000 Chinese residents homeless.

5|$|In 927, a {{peace treaty}} had been signed between Bulgaria and Byzantium, ending many years of warfare and {{establishing}} forty years of peace. Both states prospered during this interlude, but {{the balance of power}} gradually shifted in favour of the Byzantines, who made great territorial gains against the Abbasid Caliphate in the East and formed a web of alliances surrounding Bulgaria.
