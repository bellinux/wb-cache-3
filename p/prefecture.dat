5|$|Throughout Linfa's {{passage of}} Japan, the storm brought heavy {{rainfall}} {{across a wide}} swath of the country, resulting in extensive and damaging flooding. Damage was primarily concentrated on Kyushu Island. Precipitation peaked at 727mm (28.62in) at a station in Nakagoya, Miyazaki <b>Prefecture.</b> However, a station in Owase, Mie observed 497mm (19.56in) of rain in 24hours, greater than any other location for that period of time. Despite making landfall on Ehime <b>Prefecture,</b> Linfa did not cause as much damage there relative to other provinces, particularly those bordering Ehime. Nonetheless, nearly 300homes lost power during the storm there. Linfa's worst impacts occurred in Kōchi <b>Prefecture,</b> where severe flooding inundated several buildings and triggered numerous landslides. Damage there totaled ¥1.28billion (US$10.7million). Similar effects took place in Tokushima <b>Prefecture,</b> in addition to widespread evacuations from impacted areas. Damage accrued by Linfa in Tokushima <b>Prefecture</b> reached ¥1.22billion (US$10.3million). Located near the coast, high seas generated by Linfa were reported in Wakayama <b>Prefecture,</b> resulting in cancellations of offshore activities and transportation. However, much of the damage in Wakayama <b>Prefecture</b> was caused by torrential precipitation, damaging roads in seven locations, amounting to ¥197.45million (US$1.65million). Severe flooding in Mie <b>Prefecture</b> resulted from heavy, prolonged rainfall, which peaked prefecture-wide at 497mm (19.57in) in Owase. Precipitation in Mie caused widespread power outages. As many as 65buildings were flooded, and approximately 87ha (215ac) of arable land was inundated by rainwater. In addition to surface inundation, the rains caused twenty landslides, blocking roads the traffic and suspending some rail operations. Power outages were also widespread in Hyōgo <b>Prefecture,</b> including a localized outage stripping electricity from 900homes in the Kita-ku ward in Kobe; similar impacts occurred in Osaka <b>Prefecture.</b> Rising floodwater in Kanagawa <b>Prefecture</b> engulfed the first floors of several office buildings and residences. The rain also deluged roads in Yokohama, Fujisawa, Chigasaki and Odawara.|$|E
5|$|In Kyushu, {{the heavy}} {{rainfall}} caused flooding and landslides, which buried several houses in Miyazaki <b>Prefecture</b> and forced 75people to evacuate. The high wind knocked over many cypress or cedar trees, totaling 22529ha (55,670acres) and accounting for ¥64billion ($530million USD) in damage in Ōita <b>Prefecture</b> alone. Damage was heaviest near Nagasaki, where 16people were killed, including five after a warehouse collapsed during the storm. A construction worker in nearby Isahaya {{was killed when}} the winds struck him with a prebuilt hut, and airborne debris killed five people in Kumamoto <b>Prefecture</b> and seven in Fukuoka <b>Prefecture.</b> Throughout Kyushu, about 2million people lost power. High winds and waves in Kagoshima <b>Prefecture</b> overturned several cars, killing one person in Ōshima. Throughout Kyushu, about 2million people lost power. On nearby Shikoku island, high winds and rains caused ¥4.7billion ($35.7million USD) in damage in Tokushima, mostly related to fisheries, crops, and houses. A record storm surge, in conjunction with high winds, damaged a school in Sakaide, {{as well as a}} floating pier and coastal road in nearby Ehime <b>Prefecture.</b> Rough surf swept away a women in Matsuyama.|$|E

50|$|At the Meiji Restoration, the han were legitimized as {{administrative}} units under Fuhanken Sanchisei, but were gradually replaced by <b>prefectures</b> between 1868 and 1871 (urban <b>prefectures</b> were called fu and rural <b>prefectures</b> ken). Provinces {{as part of}} the system of addresses were not abolished but, on the contrary, augmented. As of 1871, the number of <b>prefectures</b> was 304, while the number of provinces was 68, not including Hokkaidō or the Ryūkyū Islands. The boundaries between the many <b>prefectures</b> were not only very complicated, but also did not match those of the provinces. <b>Prefectures</b> were gradually merged to reduce the number to 37 by 1881; a few were then divided to give a total of 45 by 1885.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} the market characteristics of <b>prefectures</b> in which non-local regional banks of other <b>prefectures</b> choose {{to enter and}} the motivations of such banks for doing so, considering the Japanese government’s requirements for regional financial institutions to {{play an active role}} in stimulating local economies. In particular, by pooling prefecture-level data, the market characteristics of <b>prefectures</b> that experience more entrances by non-local regional banks compared with other <b>prefectures</b> are examined. It was found that entrance by non-local regional banks is more common in <b>prefectures</b> where high-performing companies are active. Therefore, it can be considered that non-local regional banks that are not satisfied with lending opportunities in their home <b>prefectures</b> enter other <b>prefectures</b> to increase their lending opportunities to high-performing companies. This study contributes by clarifying why many regional banks do not concentrate on businesses within their local regions and intentionally enter other <b>prefectures,</b> which is in contrast with the intent of the region-based relationship banking policy. ...|$|R

The Meiji Fuhanken sanchisei administration created the first <b>prefectures</b> (urban -fu and rural -ken) from 1868 to replace the urban and rural administrators (bugyō, daikan, etc.) in {{the parts of the}} country previously controlled directly by the shogunate and a few territories of rebels/shogunate loyalists who had not submitted to the new government such as Aizu/Wakamatsu. In 1871, all remaining feudal domains (han) were also transformed into <b>prefectures,</b> so that <b>prefectures</b> subdivided the whole country. In several waves of territorial consolidation, today's 47 <b>prefectures</b> were formed {{by the turn of the}} century.

In August 1871, Okubo, assisted by Saigō Takamori, Kido Takayoshi, Iwakura Tomomi and Yamagata Aritomo forced through an Imperial Edict which reorganized the 261 surviving ex-feudal domains into three urban <b>prefectures</b> (fu) and 302 <b>prefectures</b> (ken).
