A {{survey of the}} state {{recently}} completed by the Iowa Agricultural Experiment station and reported in this bulletin shows clearly {{that it is time}} now for Iowa farmers to give their best thought and effort to maintaining the fertility of their farms. Hundreds of soil samples collected from the typical soil areas of the state and thoroughly analyzed show that sooner or later the production of maximum crops will he limited by the lack of some <b>plant</b> <b>food</b> <b>element</b> unless farming systems are changed to meet the situation. The phosphorus content of Iowa soils is not large and this element must be supplied to all the soil areas sooner or later. There is a marked tendency in many sections for Iowa soils to become acid and that must he corrected by lime applications. Even the supply of nitrogen and organic matter has its limitations also and demands more attention than commonly supposed...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{states the}} regularities of the within-field {{variation}} of soil fertility which {{are important for}} variable rate fertilizer application under conditions of precision agrotechnologies including the technologies which limit the agroeconomic efficiency. As it is well known, the usual (traditional) fertilizer practice stipulates their application taking into account average indices of soil fertility: mobile <b>plant</b> <b>food</b> <b>elements</b> (N, P, K etc.) content in the plow layer. At the same time, {{one part of the}} plants gets excess of mineral nutrition, and the other part – its deficiency. That results in shortage of agricultural products, their deterioration and also the pollution of the environment and the soil with the excesses of agrochemicals in overfertilized plots. In the last decades traditional technologies give place to high-precision agrotechnologies with differentiated fertilizer application taking into account within-field heterogeneity of soil fertility. There are several constraints for widespread adoption of high-precision agrotechnologies including the underestimation of the character of within-field variability of soil quality. Our investigations reveal eight regularities of the within-field variation of agrochemical indices, which characterize soil fertility in arable soils. These regularities would allow to more seriously estimate the efficiency of variable rate fertilizer application under conditions of precision agrotechnologies...|$|R

Introduction: For {{the last}} fifty years the farmers of Kansas have been {{continually}} taking crops from the soil with little thought of returning anything to it. Likewise, little attention has been given to the rotation of crops and proper methods of tillage. Usually the only object in cultivation has been to kill weeds and consequently, many years, the yields have been smaller than they would have been if the field had had the proper treatment. Planting a field continuously to the same crop for twenty-five years or more has often largely exhausted certain forms of <b>plant</b> <b>food</b> that are essential to the growth and developement of that crop. This practice up to the present time has been yielding fairly good crops for the reason thtt the soil was new and rich in the necessary <b>plant</b> <b>food</b> <b>elements.</b> At present, however the older lands are becomming so exhausted that something must be done to stop this terrible drain upon the fertility of the soil. The average farm in Kansas may be made to produce perhaps half as much more than it is now producing by the application of the best methods of soil management. The great question that confronts the farmer of today is how to build up and maintain the soil fertility, how to conserve the moisture, and how to prevent the soil from blowing and washing...|$|R
30|$|Increased {{content of}} mineral {{elements}} in crops presents {{only the first}} step in making them improved sources of nutrients for humans [10], since not all mineral <b>elements</b> in <b>plant</b> <b>foods</b> are bio-available to humans and animals. <b>Plant</b> <b>food</b> can contain anti-nutrients, which interfere with the absorption of mineral nutrients in humans and animals. The question of bio-availability must be taken into consideration when enrichment of <b>plant</b> <b>food</b> with mineral <b>elements</b> was employed. This also takes into account enhancing substances - promoters (e.g. ascorbic acid, S-containing amino acids, etc.) that promote micronutrient bioavailability and/or suppress anti-nutrient substances (e.g. phytate, polyphenolics, etc.) that inhibit micronutrient bioavailability [2, 11]. Thus, it is essential to decrease content of various anti-nutrients in foods and to increase content of promoters [9].|$|R
40|$|Wheat {{is one of}} {{the major}} crops of Utah and for more than 50 years farmers have been raising wheat on the dry lands of the state. The system they use is known as the {{alternate}} cropping or crop-follow system and consists of one year of crop alternating with one year of clean cultivation known as fallow. Wheat removes a considerable amount of the natural <b>plant</b> <b>food</b> <b>elements</b> from the soil each year. This is especially true of nitrogen. According to Bracken and Greaves (9) the original low supply of nitrogen in most Utah soils together with the depleting effects of alternate wheat and fallow has the possibility of making nitrogen rather than moisture the limiting factor of crop production in certain dry-farm areas. The amount of nitrogen removed from the soil by the wheat crop is only a portion of the total supply. Such factors as leaching to a lower depth beyond the feeding range of the plant, erosion, denitrification, and volatilization through biological and possibly chemical action are thought to be responsible for the loss of nitrogen unaccounted for by crop removal. The results of several investigators indicate that this loss is approximately twice as much as was removed by the crop. Since nitrogen {{is one of the}} major factors responsible for high yields and high quality of wheat, it naturally follows that any reduction of the amount of nitrogen in the soil produces a corresponding reduction in yield and quality of wheat. Recent reports show that this condition exists in Utah as well as in other areas. As a result of this reduction in yield and quality of wheat, processors are concerned about the problems. The seriousness of the problem cannot be over-emphasized. Ways and means of checking these losses and subsequently increasing the yield and quality are being studied. Three possible procedures for increasing soil nitrogen have been suggested: 1. the use of legumes, especially alfalfa, in a rotation program; 2. non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation: and 3. the use of commercial fertilizers. Since legumes have not been grown to any great extent, the only other natural source of nitrogen has been non-symbiotic fixation. Evidence in this field of investigation, however, indicates that this source is inadequate and that other sources must be bad. Also, the data indicate that no effective methods have been found which increase non-symbiotic fixation. Limited information suggests that further study is needed on the use of legumes for increasing the nitrogen and organic matter content of dry farm soils. This investigation is confined to the use of commercial fertilizers as one solution to the general problem...|$|R

40|$|Novel food {{regulation}} {{is already in}} force in the European Community, Australia/New Zealand and in Canada. These regulations distinguish between traditional <b>plant</b> <b>foods</b> and novel <b>plant</b> <b>foods,</b> as the novel <b>plant</b> <b>foods</b> need {{to go through a}} premarket assessment procedure. This report focus on developing a proposal for definitions and criteria for determining if a <b>plant</b> <b>food</b> is traditional or novel and a proposal for an approach for the safety assessment of such <b>plant</b> <b>foods</b> with no or limited documented history of safe consumption. The report recommend to introduce a 2 -step management procedure, first to establish the novelty and secondly to define and commit resources for the safety assessment, and recommend to generate and use a worldwide net of global, regional, local and ethnobotanical positive lists for <b>food</b> <b>plants</b> to guide both the decision on novelty and the safety assessment. The report recommends using the "history of use"-concept and if the data submitted can support the claim that a product has a history of safe use, the approval can be straightforward.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose – The aims of {{this study}} were to examine farmers 2 ̆ 7 and food {{processors}} 2 ̆ 7 alignment with consumers 2 ̆ 7 views about <b>plant</b> <b>foods</b> and their intentions to produce <b>plant</b> <b>foods.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Data on <b>plant</b> <b>food</b> beliefs were collected from mail surveys of farmers, food processing businesses and random population samples of adults in Victoria, Australia. Findings – There were strong differences between consumers 2 ̆ 7 beliefs and farmers 2 ̆ 7 and food processors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of consumers 2 ̆ 7 beliefs. For example, a higher proportion of farmers and processors believed that consumers would eat more <b>plant</b> <b>foods</b> if more convenience-oriented plant-based meals were available than consumers themselves agreed. Farmers appeared to be more aware of or aligned with consumers 2 ̆ 7 beliefs than were processors. One- and two-thirds of farmers and processors respectively were planning to grow or process more <b>plant</b> <b>foods,</b> which bodes well for the availability of <b>plant</b> and plant-based <b>foods.</b> Research limitations/implications – Study limitations include the small food industry sample sizes and possible response bias, although analysis suggests the latter was low. Future research could survey a larger sample of food industry representatives, including those from other sectors (e. g. retailers). Practical implications – Education of consumers and industry groups on <b>plant</b> <b>foods</b> and better lines of communication from consumer to processor to farmer, are required. Originality/value – To the authors 2 ̆ 7 knowledge, this is the first study to examine farmers 2 ̆ 7 and food processors 2 ̆ 7 awareness of consumers 2 ̆ 7 beliefs about <b>plant</b> <b>foods.</b> This issue is important for those involved with the production and marketing of <b>plant</b> <b>foods</b> or with food, farming and health policy. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies show}} that {{ingestion}} of whole <b>plant</b> <b>foods,</b> vegetables, fruit and whole grain cereals, is inversely related with chronic disease. Conversely, poor diet, typified by the modern Western style diet, rich in refined carbohydrates, red meat, processed foods and low in whole <b>plant</b> <b>foods</b> and fiber is associated with increased disease risk. Aberrant gut microbiota profiles define the intestinal microbiota in obesity, diabetes (both type 1 and type 2), intestinal cancer and autoimmune disease. Similarly, microbial metabolites of red meat derived choline and L-carnitine have been directly linked with CVD. Importantly, the gut microbiota too is critical for rendering {{some of the most}} important <b>plant</b> <b>food</b> molecular components, non-digestible carbohydrates and polyphenols, into biologically available and biological active intermediates. This raises the intriguing possibility that not only is gut microbiota whole <b>plant</b> <b>food</b> metabolism associated with protection from chronic disease but that we may be able modulate the gut microbiota and their activities using whole <b>plant</b> <b>foods.</b> Our ecological studies examining the gut microbiota of children growing up in rural Africa with those in urban Italy show that diet and dietary transition can dramatically impact on the gut microbiome. Similarly, we have shown that dietary intervention with certain whole <b>plant</b> <b>foods</b> can improve recognised biomarkers of metabolic disease and concomitantly modulate gut microbiota profiles. Here we discuss how whole <b>plant</b> <b>foods</b> may be employed to modulate the gut microbiome giving specific examples from both in vitro models systems and human studie...|$|R
40|$|Phytochemicals are {{reported}} to provide various biological functions leading to the promotion of health {{as well as the}} reduced risk of chronic diseases. Fat-soluble plant pigments, carotenoids, are extensively studied micronutrient phytochemicals for their potential health benefits. It is noteworthy that specific carotenoids may be responsible for different protective effects against certain diseases. In addition, each carotenoid can be obtained from different types of <b>plant</b> <b>foods.</b> Considering the fact that the phytochemical content in foods can vary according to, but not limited to, the varieties and culture conditions, it is important to establish a database of phytochemicals in locally produced <b>plant</b> <b>foods.</b> Currently, information on individual carotenoid content in <b>plant</b> <b>foods</b> commonly consumed in Korea is lacking.
