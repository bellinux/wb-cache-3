50|$|Persistent <b>pupillary</b> <b>membrane</b> (PPM) is a {{condition}} of the eye involving remnants of a fetal membrane that persist as strands of tissue crossing the pupil. The <b>pupillary</b> <b>membrane</b> in mammals exists in the fetus {{as a source of}} blood supply for the lens. It normally atrophies from the time of birth to the age of four to eight weeks. PPM occurs when this atrophy is incomplete. It generally does not cause any symptoms. The strands can connect to the cornea or lens, but most commonly {{to other parts of the}} iris. Attachment to the cornea can cause small corneal opacities, while attachment to the lens can cause small cataracts. Using topical atropine to dilate the pupil may help break down PPMs.|$|E

50|$|In humans {{the pupil}} is round, but other species, such as some cats, have {{vertical}} slit pupils, goats have horizontally oriented pupils, and some catfish have annular types. In optical terms, the anatomical pupil is the eyes aperture and the iris is the aperture stop. The {{image of the}} pupil as seen from outside the eye is the entrance pupil, which does not exactly correspond to the location {{and size of the}} physical pupil because it is magnified by the cornea. On the inner edge lies a prominent structure, the collarette, marking the junction of the embryonic <b>pupillary</b> <b>membrane</b> covering the embryonic pupil.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Purpose: To {{report the}} {{clinical}} and histopathological {{findings of a}} patient who had bilateral persistent <b>pupillary</b> <b>membrane</b> with exotropia and high hyperopia. Methods: Case Report: A 7 -year-old boy presented with a persistent <b>pupillary</b> <b>membrane</b> in both eyes. His best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20 / 20 in the right eye and 20 / 32 in the left eye with exotropia of 18 prism diopters. He underwent surgical resection of both membranes. At 5 months postoperatively, BCVA was 20 / 20 with final bilateral refraction of + 6. 5 D in both eyes. Exotropia and photophobia showed improvement immediately after surgery. Histopathological examination revealed typical features of normal iris tissue in the excised membranes. Conclusion: Bilateral persistent pupillary membranes were excised successfully without injury to other ocular tissues, including the crystalline lens.

40|$|Cataracts, simply {{defined as}} a focal or {{complete}} opacification of the lens, are {{the leading cause of}} vision in purebred and older dogs. Caratacts can be congenital or acquired postnatally, inherited, or caused by disease, toxicity, trauma, or advanced age. Surgery is the only method of restoring vision in patients blinded by cataracts. The development of phacoemulsification in conjunction with the development of the artificial lens has greatly improved the success rate of the surgery, as well as the visual acuity post-operatively. 	A 3 year old, male castrated chocolate Labrador retriever presented with the chief complaint of vision loss in both eyes. The dog was bright, alert and responsive. He was over conditioned and aside from his vision loss his physical examination was unremarkable. Initial ophthalmic examination revealed that he had bilateral mature cataracts.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1986 Cibis and {{associates}} described 2 {{children with a}} new type of congenital pupillary-iris-lens membrane with goniodysgenesis that was unilateral, sporadic, and progressive. These membranes were different from the common congenital pupillary strands that extend from 1 portion of the iris collarette to another or from the iris collarette to a focal opacity on the anterior lens surface. They also differed from the stationary congenital hypertrophic <b>pupillary</b> <b>membranes</b> that partially occlude the pupil, originating from multiple sites on the iris collarette, but not attaching directly to the lens. CASE MATERIAL: The present report is an account of 7 additional infants with congenital iris membranes, similar to those reported by Cibis {{and associates}}, which caused pupillary distortion and were variably associated with adhesions to the lens, goniodysgenesis, and progressive occlusion or seclusion of the pupil. Six of the 7 patients required surgery to open their pupils for visual purposes or to abort angle closure glaucoma. A remarkable finding was that the lenses {{in the area of the}} newly created pupils were clear, allowing an unobstructed view of normal fundi. CONCLUSION: This type of fibrous congenital iris membrane is important to recognize because of its impact on vision and its tendency to progress toward pupillary occlusion. Timely surgical intervention can abort this progressive course and allow vision to be preserved...|$|R

She had been submitted to glaucoma surgery in both eyes (OU) 7 years ago and to cataract surgery in OS 1 {{and a half years}} ago in another Institution. Current examination showed a visual acuity of no light perception in her right eye (OD) and 1 / 10 in OS, intraocular pressure (IOP) of 24 mmHg in OD and 2 mmHg in OS. Biomicroscopy revealed a medium bleb OU and an inflammatory <b>pupillary</b> <b>membrane</b> OS. Fundoscopy revealed total excavation OD and OS couldn t be observed. Normal ocular ecography OU. After two successful Nd:YAG LASER removals, the <b>pupillary</b> <b>membrane</b> reappeared. It was decided to perform a surgical membranectomy.

Three weeks after the surgery the visual acuity is 8 / 10 OS and IOP of 8 mmHg OS. Iridencleisis consists in the surgical creation of a permanent drain by incarceration of a slip of the iris within a sclerocorneal incision to act as a wick through which the aqueous is filtered from the anterior chamber to the subconjunctival tissues.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: To {{correlate}} {{the initial}} ocular presentation with bacterial identification in 100 patients with acute postcataract endophthalmitis. METHODS: This was a prospective multicenter study. Demographic data, medical history, {{and the initial}} eye examination data were recorded on a standardized form. The relationship between bacterial identification and clinical factors at baseline was studied using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: One hundred patients were {{admitted to the hospital}} with a median delay of 6 days after cataract surgery. The main symptoms were loss of vision (94. 9 %) and pain (75. 5 %). Major clinical signs were hypopyon (72 %), <b>pupillary</b> fibrin <b>membrane</b> (77. 5 %), and loss of fundus visibility (90 %). Baseline factors significantly associated with microbiologic identification were as follows: diabetes mellitus, a shorter delay of onset, initial visual acuity limited to light perception, higher intraocular pressure, chemosis, <b>pupillary</b> fibrin <b>membrane,</b> loss of the red reflex, and reduced fundus visibility. As compared with other bacteria, the identification of Streptococcus species (n = 19) was more frequently associated with male gender, diabetes mellitus, initial visual acuity limited to light perception, and pain. The Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus lugdunensis group (n = 14) differed from other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus groups (n = 33) in that those patients had greater hypopyon height. CONCLUSION: The baseline features of acute endophthalmitis after cataract surgery in the era of phacoemulsification are similar to those reported in the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study 15 years ago and differ according to the bacterial species. The association between the clinical signs and the microbiologic identification suggests that initial characteristics other than visual acuity may be useful in identifying patients presumed to be infected with a virulent species...|$|R
40|$|Congenital iris {{ectropion}} as {{an indicator}} of variant aniridia Aniridia and its variants may cause diagnos-tic difficulty especially when the iris is not wholly or partially absent. 1 2 In congenital iris ectropion (also called ectropion uveae), the posterior pigment epithelium of the iris extends onto the anterior iris surface causing darkening around the pupil. We report a man and his infant son with variant aniridia and a mutation in the PAX 6 gene, where the major anterior segment finding was iris ectropion. Case report A 30 year old man with bilateral iris ectro-pion, vision impairment, and nystagmus attributed to optic nerve hypoplasia, and his infant son also with poor vision, were examined. A search of the man’s previous ophthalmic records indicated that at 6 weeks of age he had poor vision, nystagmus, myopia (26. 0 D), and small, anomalous optic discs. Ectropion uveae was noted in the records at age 9 years. A poorly developed foveal reflex was identified in his late teens. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) head scan at age 19 years was reported as normal. Inferior corneal pannus and raised intraocular pres-sure (mid 20 s mm Hg) were identified in the patient’s twenties. Visual acuity had remained around the level of ‘‘count fingers’’ all his life. Examination at 30 years of age revealed bilateral iris ectropion and corneal pannus, but no keratitis (fig 1 A). There was bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia with tilted discs, temporal excavation, and peripapillary atrophy (fig 1 C), as well as macular hypo-plasia.

METHODS: Seventeen eyes were included between 2004 and 2010, with clinical and microbiological data collected prospectively. Conventional cultures and panbacterial PCR {{were performed on}} aqueous and vitreous samples. RESULTS: Clinical signs of endophthalmitis were observed soon after trauma (1. 5 ± 2. 5 days). Laceration with an intraocular foreign body (IOFB) was noted in 53 % of the patients. At admission, all patients had aqueous humour (71 %) and/or vitreous (53 %) samples. Fifteen patients (88 %) underwent a pars plana vitrectomy. Bacteria were identified in 77 % of the cases: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), Streptococcus (n = 4), Bacillus (n = 2), Pseudomonas stuzeri (n = 1), and Streptococcus salivarius and Gemella haemolysans (multibacterial infection, n = 1). Progression toward phthisis was observed in 35 % of the cases; 41 % of the patients recuperated visual acuity (VA) ≥ 20 / 40.
