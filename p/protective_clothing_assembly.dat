New fabrication techniques {{led to the}} Mercury Space Suit, a constant-wear hybrid of the omni-environmental full pressure suit used by high-flying pilots of the 1950 s. The Gemini program (1964 - 1966) provided the first specifically designed <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>assembly</b> for both intra- and extravehicular operations. The G 4 C, used for EV (extravehicular) activities, protected the astronaut against solar radiation, heat loss, and meteoroid penetration. The clothing for the Apollo program (1968 - 1975) mirrored a greater concern for fire safety with Durette (a halogenated polyamide) and PBI (polybenzimadazole) widely used for intravehicular garments. With {{the advent of the}} Shuttle program, cabin pressure and composition were changed from 6 psi, 100 % oxygen to 9 - 14 psi, 23. 4 % oxygen, 76. 6 % N 2. As a result, 'off-the-shelf' materials were used without compromising fire safety. Reusability was stressed, as textile costs and durability were now important selection criteria noting that existing textile materials will probably be adequate for the next 20 years of space operations and research. A portable lunar survival shelter made of textiles is being developed; and a preliminary design for an EV 'tunnel suit system' (an access tunnel and homoform work station) is already in existence...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{construct}} functional sportswear such as F/W mountain climbing wear, which requires adaptability at different temperature and humidity from top {{to the foot of}} the mountain, thermodynamic analysis for the ventilation effect is necessary. The effective slit design is also important for running wear to remove body heat and sweat as the wearers are exposed to various environment conditions. As Shivers et al. (1977) showed that the slit location, openings and closures in the clothing have a significant effect on the rate of air exchange and circulation through ventilation. Lim et al. (2009) also pointed out that the slit position has a significant influence on the microclimate temperature and humidity of the areas localized around the slits. This is due to emission of heat and moisture through the exchange of air at the areas closest to the slits. Assessment of the movement of heat and moisture between the human body and its environment has been carried out through wear tests. However, a lack of reproducibility and its time-consuming and expensive costs are problems and hamper the scientific analysis of the ventilation effects. The earlier studies mainly showed the effects of ventilation on air exchange rates by using trace gas technique. Crockford et al. (1972) developed a method to measure air exchange rates in the clothing microclimate using a trace gas technique. Birnbaun and Crockford (1978) used trace gas to measure the air exchange rate and proposed a ventilation index to describe the performance of <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Since then, other devices and theoretical models have been used to evaluate the effects of ventilation under various conditions. Havenith et al. (1990) derived the values of the permeability index from change due to posture, movement and wind using the trace gas diffusion method. Chu and Nakajima (1997) investigated the effects of environmental temperature and the position of the opening on the clothing on ventilation of a thermal manikin by the trace gas method. Satsumoto et al. (2000) examined the effect of bellows action on heat transfer in the clothing system by using a device that consisted of a simulated skin and a clothing material plate. Satsumoto and Havenith (2010) developed a device to evaluate the distribution of ventilation in diapers and investigated the effect of the design and material factors of diapers on heat and water vapor transfer through ventilation.|$|R
40|$|A three-level two-factor (32) full {{factorial}} design {{was conducted to}} examine the effects of the batting constructions (e. g. batting types and positions) on moisture transport through multi-layer <b>clothing</b> <b>assemblies</b> consisting of different types of batting under subzero environmental conditions. The amounts of moisture accumulated within and transmitted through the different batting constructions during a 24 h period at - 20 °C were measured on a developed sweating guarded hot plate. The factorial analysis on the experimental results showed that the inner batting type had the most significant influence on moisture accumulation and transmission within the <b>clothing</b> <b>assemblies,</b> although the effects of the outer batting type and the interaction between the inner and outer batting types were also significant. The analysis showed that placing wool batting instead of down batting in the inner region could efficiently minimize the moisture accumulation within the batting constructions and consequently upgrade the thermal comfort of the cold <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> systems.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to improve the construction of impermeable clothing protecting against liquid chemical agents in order to lower the thermal strain caused by the clothing during work.

Then the results were compared with a basic model of impermeable <b>protective</b> <b>clothing.</b> Results indicated that all new models of <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> allowed workers to work 39 – 64 % longer than in a basic model of <b>protective</b> <b>clothing.</b> Thus new clothing significantly improved comfort of work in impermeable <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> because of the lower thermal strain that it imposed on the user. hot environment <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> physiological responses 1...|$|R

The protection and comfort requirements are always the contradicting fact in several <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> including fire-fighters’. Appropriate material selection, clothing design and final evaluation of the results {{play a critical role in}} predicting the clothing performance and comfort. Several researches have been done on the performance and comfort improvement of fire-fighter’s <b>protective</b> <b>clothing.</b> However, detailed review related to these parameters is not being reported in recent years. In this perspective review, we report the recent trends in the performance and comfort properties of the fire-fighters <b>protective</b> <b>clothing.</b> The clothing design and different materials used to achieve a balance between performance and comfort is illustrated.

30|$|Wearing <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> is {{essential}} to protect the fire-fighters from thermal exposures and other life threatening risks. In general, the standard <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> is a multilayer construction, which is heavy and bulky to provide the desired thermal protection. This in turn reduces {{the ability of the}} <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> to transfer internal heat to the surrounding atmosphere and creates heat stress to the fire-fighters. Hence, the moisture produced by sweating remains inside the clothing system resulting in a sensation of wet clinginess and thermal discomfort to the wearer. Therefore, optimizing the thermal protection and comfort properties of the PPC have been the major area of research in recent years. The comfort properties of the fire-fighters personal <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> (FFPPC) is a complex phenomenon governed by the transport properties and thermal resistance of the fabric combinations. An ideal clothing will provide the necessary protection as well as minimize the metabolic heat stress. However, these are the two conflicting factors to be considered while designing <b>protective</b> <b>clothing</b> for fire-fighters (Scott [2005]).|$|R
