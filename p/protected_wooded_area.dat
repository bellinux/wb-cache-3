50|$|Mills Reservation is {{a county}} park, {{consisting}} of a 157.15 acre <b>protected</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> located in Cedar Grove and Montclair, New Jersey, United States. The reservation is maintained by the Essex County Park Commission. The reservation has several walking/jogging trails, including four major trails and numerous smaller trails. One of the four main trails leads to a cliff that overlooks the New York City skyline.|$|E
50|$|As mayor, Woodside {{can count}} {{a range of}} accomplishments, {{including}} promoting information technology in Fredericton, {{and the development of}} information technology infrastructure such as the Fred eZone wireless zone. During his tenure as mayor, music festivals have been promoted in Fredericton including the Harvest and Blues Jazz Festival, the Country Music Festival, and FredRock. While infill development and sustainability have been priorities of his tenure as mayor, he has also faced controversy over sprawling box-store development in the university woods, a previously <b>protected</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{picnic area}} on the ocean {{side of the island}} {{features}} plenty of picnic tables, a full bathroom with showers, and a boardwalk to traverse the 20 ft-high dune ridge to the beach. The dune is needed to <b>protect</b> the <b>wooded</b> <b>area</b> and interior of the island from erosion due to storms. This area was repaired in 1983, with bulldozers pushing new primary dunes into place to correct the damage caused by 30 years of beachgoers trampling over the enormous dunes to the beach.|$|R
25|$|A {{search of}} records related to Bonie's cell phone found {{a series of}} pings that night, {{as well as some}} calls from towers in Orange and Rockland counties, {{northwest}} of the city {{on the other side of}} the Hudson River. Bonie has relatives living there. One detective, Malcolm Reiman, worked with a ballistics expert to narrow a search area based on Bonie's known departure and arrival times at his house and an estimated rate of road travel speed. Within that area, they searched road embankments, primarily in Harriman State Park, a large <b>wooded</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> that straddles the border between the two counties, but did not find Moore's body.|$|R
40|$|In 2001, {{samples of}} liver (n = 38) and perirenal fat (n = 25) (only in males) {{were taken from}} European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) populating a hilly, <b>wooded</b> <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> in the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy. Samples were {{analyzed}} for organochlorine pesticides dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocycloexane alpha-, beta- and gamma-isomers (alpha-, beta- and gamma-HCH), alpha-endosulfan, aldrin, dieldrin and endrin, and the seven PCB 'indicator' congeners IUPAC Nos. 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180, in order to investigate {{the current state of}} contamination of the area and to assess the possible toxicological risks for the monitored species. p,p'-DDE was detected in 95 % of the liver and perirenal fat samples (n = 63), at concentrations ranging from 0. 05). Females were not statistically tested because they were all adults. The levels of organochlorine contaminants were well below those associated with adverse reproductive effects and lethality in mammals...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} a <b>protected</b> <b>wooded</b> <b>area,</b> {{which is part of the}} Parco Regionale Gallipoli Cognato Piccole Dolomiti Lucane, one of the most {{important}} ecological reserves in southern Italy. From April 2010 to April 2011, 212 birds, comprising 22 species from 12 families, were captured and examined for ticks. A total of 75 (35. 4 %) birds were found infested by ticks, with 451 ticks being collected. All ticks were identified as Ixodes ricinus, of which 241 (53. 4 %) were larvae and 210 nymphs (46. 6 %). The highest intensity of infestation was found in April 2010, when 117 ticks were retrieved on 25 birds. No ticks were found on birds (n = 5) netted in December 2010. High infestation rates were recorded on blackbirds (Turdus merula) (90 %; 29 birds examined) and on mistle thrushes (Turdus viscivorus) (100 %; 2 birds examined). The highest intensity of infestation by larvae was found on wrens (5. 6 larvae/bird) and by nymphs on mistle thrushes (11. 5 nymphs/bird). Temperature and number of hours of light showed to influence the activity of larvae and nymphs. These data support the notion that birds may be responsible for the heterogeneous distribution of I. ricinus in Europe, thus playing a role in the epidemiology of certain tick-borne pathogens...|$|E
