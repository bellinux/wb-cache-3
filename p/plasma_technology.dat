50|$|<b>Plasma</b> <b>technology</b> {{was used}} to modify a {{polyethylene}} membrane for enhanced adhesion, wettability and printability.

The resulting acrylonitrile-coated membrane was named PiAn-PE. The surface characterization demonstrated that PiAN-PE's enhanced adhesion resulted from the increased polar component of surface energy.|$|E
