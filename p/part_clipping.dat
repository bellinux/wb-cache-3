40|$|Small mammal keepers need {{excellent}} observational {{skills to}} identify individual animals and determine {{changes in their}} condition and daily behavior, because these parameters are scaled down to the sizes of the small mammal species under their care. Animals might be identified through passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, individual characteristics, tattoos, or body <b>part</b> <b>clipping.</b> Even the least visible identification method (PIT tags) requires the keeper to {{have the time and}} expertise to get close to the animal with a digital reader. Condition changes are relatively easy to observe in large animals like deer and antelope, but difficult to observe in small mammals, unless the keeper takes the time to observe each animal as it moves toward food and around in the environment; these observations need to take place at the appropriate time every day. It is difficult, for example, to determine the condition of a sloth or mouse housed in a diurnal environment if that nocturnal animal is asleep in a nest box every time the keeper tries to observe it. So it might be better if occasionally the keeper were scheduled on an evening shift (e. g., during an evening event at the zoo) to observe the animal while it is active...|$|E

40|$|The use, and the joining process, of {{dissimilar}} {{materials have}} recently been highlighted. Joining of dissimilar materials can however be problematic, due to different material properties. Different materials respond differently to temperature changes and this might lead to deformations and stress in the final assembly. The joining methods differ also often from the one used to join similar material. Variation simulation is used to predict the geometrical variation of a subassembly or a final product. In variation simulation of dissimilar materials {{it is important to}} include material properties in order to achieve an accurate result. Also the effects form joining method must be included in the simulation. To join dissimilar materials like plastic and sheet metal <b>parts,</b> <b>clip</b> fasteners are often used. This paper presents a method for variation simulation of dissimilar materials with a focus on how to model clip fasteners. The method allows effects of temperature changes on holding forces and geometrical variation in the final assembly to be evaluated. Holding force refers to the force a clip fastener must withstand after the parts are joined. The method proposed can be used to support the design and selection of clip fasteners...|$|R

40|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} effective method to reduce PAPR {{might be the}} clipping and filtering [1], but the error performance of clipped OFDM signal is degraded due to the distortion of the original signals. The simplest and most effective method to reduce peak to average power ratio (PAPR) might be the clipping and filtering, but the error performance of clipped Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signal is degraded due to the distortion of the original signals. This paper suggests a simple solution to eliminate the degradation in the SER performance that caused by clipping the OFDM signal at the transmitter side by copying the <b>clipped</b> <b>part</b> of the OFDM signal and provide it to the receiver to recover the original signal. The delay in receiving the signal will be calculated to insure the receiver {{will be able to}} recognize and recover the <b>clipped</b> <b>part</b> of the original signal very well. With this proposed method there is freedom to use low clipping ratio (CR) and therefore it is easy to get efficient PAPR reduction. But it is better to choose the appropriate CR to avoid wasting the bandwidth by minimizing the amount of the copied <b>part</b> of the <b>clipped</b> signal. Key words...|$|R

30|$|Design and {{procedure}} Then 40 video clips were shown either as complete clips {{or with the}} ball contact excluded. The first <b>part</b> of each <b>clip</b> was between 1.4 and 15 seconds long. The clips were either causally connected or not (see “General method”). We always deleted four frames before the ball contact frame, resulting in a deletion of 160 ms in both incomplete conditions (the presentation rate of each clip was 25 frames per second). The second <b>part</b> of the <b>clip</b> was between 1.2 and 6.3 seconds long. 4 Clips consisted of 14 kick-offs, 5 corners, 13 throw-ins, and 8 free kicks. Participants received specific information on {{the probability that the}} ball contact was visible (50 %). Further, they saw a process graphic of a matchstick man approaching a ball and kicking it so that they knew what “ball contact moment” or “moment of ball release” meant. The suggested experiment has been conducted as a mixed 2 (ball contact visible, within-subject manipulation) × 2 (second part of the clip: causal or non-causal, order was balanced between groups) design.|$|R
