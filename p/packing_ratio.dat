40|$|Abstract In {{this work}} {{we present a}} simple, fast {{technique}} for generating particle packs at high <b>packing</b> <b>ratios</b> aiming at the simulation of granular compacts via the discrete element method (DEM). We start from a random sequence addition particle generation algorithm to generate a "layer" of non-overlapping spherical particles that are let to evolve dynamically in time under the action of "compacting" or "jamming" pseudo forces. A "layer-by-layer" approach is then followed to generate multiple layers {{on top of each}} other. In the end, very dense packs with pre-defined bulk shapes and sizes (e. g. rectangles in two dimensions and prisms in three dimensions) are achieved. The influence of rolling motion (with particle rotation and spin) along with inter-particle friction on the density and ordering of the generated packs is assessed. Both congruent and inhomogeneous packs (with respect to particle sizes) are created and their packing properties evaluated. We believe that simple techniques for fast generation of particle packs at high <b>packing</b> <b>ratios</b> are essential tools for the DEM simulation of granular compacts...|$|R

The oxygen of the water fuels the exothermic reaction, leaving hydrogen bubbles which causes the compound to foam. Given no compression, the foam rises to fill the space allowed. Based on the mixture and the specific makeup of the two chemicals, {{it is possible to}} estimate exactly how much foam is required to fill a given space.

40|$|An asphalt {{mixture is}} {{combined}} {{of different sizes}} of aggregate, filler, and bitumen for application on the most common road construction materials. In asphalt pavement material there are different types of distress such as permanent deformation (rutting), fatigue cracking, ravelling, potholes, stripping, etc. There are many reasons for these types of distress, some of them related to the pavement structure, e. g. whether the underlying layers are weak, others related to the mixture properties. Other causes {{could be related to}} external conditions such as high temperature, high axle load, long duration of load application, etc. This research has focused on the permanent deformation (rutting) as a function of aggregate gradation. The aggregate gradations of more than twenty asphalt mixtures, manufactured with different gradations, were analysed by using the Bailey method of gradation analysis. The analysis was performed in relation to Repeated Load Axial Test (RLAT) testing results to study the performance of each mixture. The results showed that the Bailey method is not capable on its own to define the differences between the gradations of each mixture. Therefore, three more <b>packing</b> <b>ratios</b> were introduced to adequately describe the aggregate gradation. The aggregate particle packing was extensively studied through these <b>packing</b> <b>ratios</b> and it was shown how the different particle sizes interact with each other. Images were taken for two mixtures to validate the theory behind the <b>ratios.</b> The five <b>packing</b> <b>ratios</b> (two of Bailey and three new ratios) were used in Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) techniques for all the mixtures as input data to predict the mixture performance (RLAT permanent deformation and Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus ITSM stiffness modulus) and they showed good prediction capability. After establishing the impact of aggregate packing on the performance, six mixtures were re-manufactured and re-tested with different variables; the selection of the mixtures was made to cover a range of different gradations (ratios). The aim of this step was to understand the effect of these variables on the asphalt mixture {{in the light of the}} <b>packing</b> <b>ratios.</b> The variables that were used were binder content, testing temperature and compaction effort. The binder content results showed an interesting effect on the permanent deformation and stiffness of the asphalt mixture. The packing of aggregate was very helpful in understanding the different mixture behaviour with different binder content. The effect of aggregate packing was not shown at relatively low testing temperature, but as the temperature rises the aggregate packing effect starts to appear. The effect of compaction which was represented by the number of gyrations in gyratory compactor was inconsistent; results show over-compaction can lead to poor performance. Finally, a linear viscous method was introduced aiming to predict the rutting in an asphalt mixture. The method was based on using a multilayer linear programme (BISAR) and using viscous parameters of the mixture as input. The non-linear properties of the material were incorporated by using the RLAT test. For this purpose, six mixtures were used and tested in a wheel tracking machine. The predicted results were compared with the wheel tracking rut depth in the laboratory and showed good agreement at different temperatures. However, at high temperature (50 Â°C) the material properties in the RLAT test did not behave as linear viscous, which resulted in a much poorer prediction. Trials were made to predict field rut but it was found that special requirements were needed for the approach which were not available at the time of the research. However, for the available field data, the method was found to be a good predictor...|$|R

30|$|The {{length of}} a DNA {{is much greater than}} the size of the nucleus and for this reason, the DNA has to be packed tightly in a chromosome. The degree to which DNA is {{compressed}} is called its <b>packing</b> <b>ratio</b> [5]. In a chromosome, this packing occurs during several stages. In the first stage of packing, DNA winds around a protein core to produce a âbead-likeâ structure termed a nucleosome. This results in a <b>packing</b> <b>ratio</b> of about 6. The second stage of packing is the coiling of beads in a helical structure called the 30 Â nm fiber that is found in all types of chromosomes. This structure increases the <b>packing</b> <b>ratio</b> to about 40. The final packaging happens when the fiber is organized in loops, scaffolds and domains that give a final <b>packing</b> <b>ratio</b> of about 1000 â 10, 000 in different types of chromosomes. During these stages, four types of inductor or coil appear. One coil emerges because the electric dipoles in the structure of a DNA. A second type is produced by coiling DNA bases around the histone in a nucleosome (see Fig.Â  3 -left hand up). A third type is created by the formation of loops in a chromatin fiber (see Fig.Â  3 -left and, down), and finally, a fourth type of inductor emerges along the supercoil within a chromosome (see Fig.Â  3 -right hand top).

The effects of fuel and environmental variables on the gas temperature profile and the âsurface wind speed â (gas velocity at the fuel bed surface) are reported. In non-zero winds, {{the temperature of the}} air near the fuel bed surface decays exponentially with distance from the fire front. In zero winds, the temperature decreases rapidly within a very short distance of the flame front, then decays slowly thereafter. The maximum air temperature decreases as the free stream wind speed, <b>packing</b> <b>ratio</b> and fuel moisture content increase. The characteristic distance of the exponential decay increases strongly with the free stream wind speed and decreases with the <b>packing</b> <b>ratio</b> and surface area-to-volume ratio of the fuel. The surface wind speed depends strongly on the free stream wind speed, {{and to a lesser extent}} on <b>packing</b> <b>ratio,</b> fuel bed depth and fuel moisture content. There are three general regimes for the surface flow: (1) a constant velocity flow of approximately half the free stream flow, far from the flame front; (2) an intermediate zone of minimum flow characterised by low or reversed flow; and (3) a region near the flame front where the velocity rises rapidly almost to the free stream velocity. The boundaries between the three regions move further from the flame front with increasing wind speed, in a way which is only slightly affected by fuel geometry...|$|E

For the single-layer systems, the carrier was employed at the packing ratios of 10 % and 20 % based on the bioreactor water volume. In the double-layer system, carriers were separated into two layers which occupied the top and bottom parts of the reactor with an overall <b>packing</b> <b>ratio</b> of 13 %. At the organic and nitrogen loading of O. 75 kg COD/m 3 /day and 0. 16 kg NH 3 -N/m 3 /day, all these systems achieved more than 96 % of SCOD removal and NH 3 -N removal efficiencies under continuous aeration. The double-layer system achieved about 40 % of total nitrogen removal, which was comparable with the single-layer system with <b>packing</b> <b>ratio</b> of 20 % but higher than the single-layer system with a <b>packing</b> <b>ratio</b> of 10 %. The SRT for the double-layer system and single-layer system with a <b>packing</b> <b>ratio</b> of 20 % could be achieved to more than 200 days. Based on the economics analysis, in the achievement of comparable performance, the capital cost for the double-layer configuration was lower than that for the single-layer configuration. Therefore, double layer configuration is recommended for the EMMC-biobarrel process design. EMMC-biobarrel process offers many advantages over the existing wastewater treatment processes including small space requirement, simple operation and maintenance and. improved nitrogen removal. It demonstrates great potential for onsite, small scale/land limited wastewater treatment applications. The installation cost for an EMMC-biobarrel treatment unit with capacity of 400 gallons/day and 1, 500 gallons/day are estimated as $ 4, 671 and $ 10, 191, respectively, which are comparable or lower than those for the existing commercial products which also involve the nitrogen removal technology.

Both point and composite FRI were shorter in low-elevation pine-oak forests, longer in upper-elevation fir-mixed conifer forests, and intermediate in mid-elevation pine-mixed conifer forests. The inverse relationship between fire frequency and elevation has previously been noted in the central Sierra Nevada (Caprio and Swetnam 1995), the Cascade Range (Taylor 2000, Bekker and Taylor 2001), and the Blue Mountains in Oregon (Heyerdahl et al. 2001). The increase in length of FRI with elevation is attributable to several factors that influence the flammability of forest fuels, and the behavior and spread of fire. First, the density of litter mats varies with forest composition. Forests dominated by short-needled species of fir have dense litter mats that retain more moisture and have low <b>packing</b> <b>ratios,</b> which results in lower rates of spread and fire line intensity (Albini 1976, Rothermel 1983, van Wagtendonk et al. 1998). Second, rates of fine fuel production are higher in warm low-elevation pine-dominated forest so fuel recovery after a fire occurs more rapidly and stands can burn sooner (Agee et al. 1978, Strohlgen 1988). Finally, longer snow-free periods in low-elevation stands lengthen the period that fuels are dry enough to burn each year compared to upper-elevation stands with later lying snowpacks (Agee 1993, Lutz et al. 2009).|$|R

40|$|Everything in the {{universe}} that has mass possesses stiffness and intrinsic damping. Owing to the stiffness property, mass will vibrate when excited and its intrinsic damping property will act to stop the vibration. The particle impact damper (PID) {{is a very interesting}} damper that affects impact and friction effects of particles by means of energy dissipation. PID is a means for achieving high structural damping by using a particle-filled enclosure attached to a structure. The particles absorb the kinetic energy of the structure and convert it into heat through inelastic collisions between the particles themselves and between the particles and the walls of the enclosure. In this work, PID is measured for a cantilever mild steel beam with an enclosure attached to its free end; copper particles are used in this study. The PID is found to be highly nonlinear. The most useful observation is that for a very small weight penalty (about 7 % to 8 %), the maximum damped amplitude of vibration at resonance with a PID, is about 9 to 10 times smaller than that without a PID. It is for more than that of with only intrinsic material damping of a majority of structural metals.

The results suggest that the initial folding step in nucleosome packing involves the formation of a zig-zag ribbon as has been proposed by others (Thoma F., T. Koller, and A. Klug, 1979, J. Cell Biol., 83 : 403 - 427; Worcel A., S. Strogartz, and D. Riley, 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 78 : 1461 - 1465), and that subsequent compaction occurs by coiling of the ribbon to form a double helical structure. This type of folding generates a fiber in which the nucleosome-nucleosome contacts established in the zig-zag ribbon are maintained and in which the histone H 1 molecules occupy equivalent sites. The diameter of the fiber is not dependent upon the nucleosome repeat length. Direct mass values for individual isolated fibers obtained from electron scattering measurements showed that the mass per length was dependent on ionic strength, and ranged from 6. 0 X 10 (4) daltons/nm at 10 mM NaCl to 27 X 10 (4) daltons/nm at 150 mM salt.
