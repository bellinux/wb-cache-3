5|$|After the 2000 presidential elections, Belgrade was {{the site}} of major public protests, with over half a million <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> These demonstrations {{resulted}} in the ousting of president Milošević.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 1991, massive demonstrations led by Vuk Drašković {{were held}} in the city against Slobodan Milošević. According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Two people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks were {{deployed}} onto the streets to restore order. Further protests {{were held in}} Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud at local elections. These protests brought Zoran Đinđić to power, the first mayor of Belgrade since World War II who {{did not belong to}} the League of Communists of Yugoslavia or its later offshoot, the Socialist Party of Serbia.|$|E
5|$|One week later, Mrs. Mallard {{leads the}} ducklings ashore and {{straight}} to the highway in hopes of crossing to reach the Garden, but she has trouble crossing as the cars will not yield to her. Michael, the policeman who the Mallards visited, stops traffic for the family to cross. Michael calls police headquarters and instructs them to send a police car to stop traffic along the route for the ducks. The ducks cross the highway, Embankment Road (Storrow Drive {{had yet to be}} constructed when the book was written), then proceed down Mount Vernon Street to Charles Street where they head south to the Garden. The <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> admire the family of ducks. When the family must cross Beacon Street to enter the Garden, there are four policemen standing in the intersection stopping traffic {{to make way for the}} ducklings. Mr. Mallard is waiting in the Public Garden for the rest of the family. Finally, the family decides to stay in the Garden and lives happily ever after. They end each day searching for peanuts and food, and when night falls, they swim to their little island and go to sleep.|$|E

25|$|The Hillcrest Fire Department (also {{known as}} the Moleston Fire District) {{provides}} fire protection services to New Square. In March 2007, the fire district met with Town of Ramapo supervisors and proposed removing New Square from its fire district after a February 7, 2007, fire that destroyed two buildings in New Square. Further hazards stem {{from the fact that}} the town has only one main access road (Washington Avenue), and the failure of some residents to yield to emergency vehicles, or to the crowd of <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> surrounding an incident. There also have been isolated cases of residents tampering with fire equipment while responders are on scene.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is noted}} for its streetscapes with narrow {{cobblestone}} lanes, that rise and fall over the hilly terrain, and occasionally defy colonial attempts to make a straight grid. It is still a small city, and at night, many wander the narrow streets with relative safety. The <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> are a mix of Mexicans, foreigners and indigenous. Its cultural and artistic reputation has brought many people from Mexico and abroad here to live. Several publications have named {{it one of the}} top 10 places to retire. The town has attracted famous people such as Jose Guadalupe Mojica, Pedro Vargas and Cantinflas to have homes here. Additionally, indigenous peoples, mostly Otomis and Nahuas (Chichimecas) can be seen on the streets, as they come to sell and buy from rural communities as well as to attend church.|$|E

25|$|After {{the success}} of Chocolat, Binoche was internationally {{recognized}} as an A-list movie star in the early 2000s, but as an actor her persona became somewhat fixed following a series of period roles portraying a stoic heroine facing tragedy and desolation. Keen to try something new, Binoche returned to French cinema in 2002 in an unlikely role: she played a ditsy beautician in Jet Lag opposite Jean Reno. The film, directed by Daniele Thompson, was a box-office hit in France and Binoche was once again nominated for a César for Best Actress. The film {{tells the story of}} a couple who meet at an airport during a strike. Initially the pair despises each other, but, over the course of one night, they find common ground and maybe even love. This playful spirit continued when Binoche featured in a 2003 Italian television commercial for the chocolates Ferrero Rocher. The advertisement played upon her Chocolat persona featuring Binoche handing out the chocolates to <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Paris.|$|E
25|$|At about 17:30 on Friday 17 May 1974, without warning, three {{car bombs}} {{exploded}} in Dublin city centre at Parnell Street, Talbot Street and South Leinster Street during rush hour. The streets all ran east-west from busy thoroughfares to railway stations. There was a bus strike in Dublin at the time, which meant {{there were more}} <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> than usual. According {{to one of the}} Irish Army's top bomb disposal officers, Commandant Patrick Trears, the bombs were constructed so well that 100% of each bomb exploded upon detonation. Twenty-three people died in these explosions and three others died from their injuries over the following few days and weeks. Many of the dead were young women originally from rural towns employed in the civil service. An entire family from central Dublin was killed. Two of the victims were foreign: an Italian man, and a French Jewish woman whose family had survived the Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|A form {{of sexual}} {{violence}} {{on the rise in}} the United States is Human Trafficking. Poverty can lead to increased trafficking due to more <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Women who are impoverished, foreign, socially deprived, or at other disadvantages are more susceptible to being recruited into trafficking. Many laws stated in Kelsey Tumiel’s dissertation, have recently been made to try to combat the phenomenon, but it is predicted that human trafficking will surpass illegal drug trafficking amounts in the US. Women that are victims of these sexual violence acts have a difficult time escaping the life due to abuse of power, organized crime, and insufficient laws to protect them. There are more people current enslaved in trafficking than there were during the African slave trade. “Branding” of human trafficking brings awareness to the issue claims Tam Mai, the author. This allows for public assertion and intervention. A claim made in Tam Mai's article states that by reducing poverty, thus may lead to a decrease in trafficking from the streets.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, debutant {{director}} Bala {{offered him}} {{the role of}} the rogue, Sethu (Chiyaan), in the film Sethu. To prepare for the character, Vikram shaved his head, lost twenty-one kilograms and grew his nails long for the role. [...] After beginning production in April 1997, the film went through development hell after industry strikes and lack of funds hampered progress. During this phase, he did not accept other acting offers {{in order to maintain the}} continuity of his looks. The film then struggled to find a distributor, who shunned it due to the tragic climax and the film remained unreleased. Vikram described the period of production as [...] "the worst phase of his career" [...] as he was financially strapped and [...] "his fire was in danger of dying down". He turned down an opportunity from a friend to take up a job in technology and attempted to stay in the industry by directing a serial titled Mounam Pesiyadhey, with Ameer as his assistant director. Sethu finally released in December 1999 and initially began running at a single noon show at a suburban theater but gradually gained an audience through word-of-mouth publicity. Eventually it ran for over one hundred days at several cinema halls across Chennai. Vikram was constantly being mobbed by <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> as a result of the film's success. Critics praised Vikram's performance with a reviewer referring to Vikram as [...] "a revelation" [...] and that [...] "he is very natural and his acting in last few scenes are just too good and could even be compared with the best we have seen". Similarly, a critic from the Malaysian daily, New Straits Times, described the film as an [...] "unforgettable experience" [...] and described Vikram's performance as [...] "praise-worthy". The performance drew accolades with Vikram winning the Filmfare Special Award– South and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for his portrayal of the title character, while reports emerged that he missed out on the National Film Award for Best Actor by a single vote to Mohanlal. Post-Sethu, Vikram has described the film would have been close to him regardless of its commercial success and that it put him on the [...] "right path", with Vikram choosing to adapt the prefix of Chiyaan to his screen name.|$|E
