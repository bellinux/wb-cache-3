5|$|Few prose {{narrative}} sources survive from Æthelstan's reign, but {{it produced}} {{an abundance of}} poetry, much of it Norse-influenced <b>praise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King in grandiose terms, such as the Brunanburh poem. Sarah Foot even made a case that Beowulf may have been composed in Æthelstan's circle.|$|E
5|$|In about 630, Christianity was {{permanently}} re-established in East Anglia when Sigeberht and Ecgric succeeded to rule jointly. Ecgric, who {{may have}} been a sub-king until the abdication of Sigeberht in around 634, seems to have remained a pagan. There is no evidence that Ecgric adopted or promoted Christianity: Bede wrote nothing to imply that he was a Christian, in contrast to his <b>praise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> devout Sigeberht, the first English king to receive a Christian baptism and education before his succession.|$|E

5|$|The mythological legends {{regarding}} {{the origin of}} Kerala are Hindu in nature. Kerala produced several saints and movements. Adi Shankara was a religious philosopher who contributed to Hinduism and propagated the philosophy of Advaita. He was instrumental in establishing four mathas at Sringeri, Dwarka, Puri and Jyotirmath. Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri was another religious figure who composed Narayaniyam, a collection of verses in <b>praise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hindu God Krishna.|$|E

A whole chapter on a dispute between doctors was completely removed, along with various sections of dialogue and <b>praise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Glastonbury Waters.

5|$|From his time, Tulsidas {{has been}} {{acclaimed}} by Indian and Western scholars alike for his poetry and his {{impact on the}} Hindu society. Tulsidas mentions in his work Kavitavali that he was considered a great sage in the world.

5|$|Ramarayaningar got {{his first}} taste of {{politics}} when he {{was appointed to the}} district board of North Arcot. In 1912, he was nominated to the Imperial Legislative Council of India and represented the landlords and zamindars of South India. He served as a legislator until 1915. During this period, Ramarayaningar earned the <b>praise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Viceroy, Lord Hardinge. He actively supported reforms in the Hindu society. In 1914, Ramarayaningar moved a legislation for the creation of separate Provincial departments for the welfare of depressed classes. In 1915, he was elected President of the Third Andhra Congress.|$|E
5|$|Several of Josquin's masses {{feature the}} {{paraphrase}} technique, and they {{include some of}} his most famous work including the great Missa Gaudeamus. The relatively early Missa Ave maris stella, which probably dates from his years in the Sistine Chapel choir, paraphrases the Marian antiphon of the same name; {{it is also one of}} his shortest masses. The late Missa de Beata Virgine paraphrases plainchants in <b>praise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary; it is a Lady Mass, a votive mass for Saturday performance, and was his most popular mass in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the mysteries developed after Isis's Hellenized cult reached Greece itself, later in the third century BCE. Much of the early evidence of Isis worship in Greece comes from aretalogies, poems in <b>praise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goddess. The wording of aretalogies from Maroneia and Andros, both from the first century BCE, closely links Isis with mystery rites. Petra Pakkanen says that these aretalogies prove the mysteries of Isis existed by that time, but Jan Bremmer argues that they only connect Isis with the Eleusinian Mysteries, not with distinctive rites of her own. Stronger evidence for mysteries of Isis {{is found in the}} first century CE, and they certainly existed in the second. Temples to Isis in Greece may have developed their mysteries in response to the widespread belief that the Greek mystery cults had originated with Isis and Osiris in Egypt. They could have adapted elements of Eleusinian rites, and perhaps Dionysian mysteries as well, to reflect Egyptian mythology. The end product would have seemed to the Greeks like an authentic Egyptian precursor to Greek mysteries. Many Greco-Roman sources claim that Isis herself devised these rites.|$|E

5|$|The Garden of Words premiered at the Gold Coast Film Festival in Australia on April 28, 2013 and had {{its general}} release on May 31, 2013 in Japan.

The Garden of Words had an unusual release schedule since it was released digitally on iTunes {{the same day as}} the Japanese theatrical premier, and its DVD and Blu-ray were released while the film was still in theaters, on June 21. The film has been licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America, Anime Limited in the UK, and Madman Entertainment in Australia. The film performed well in theaters {{for an extended period of}} time and was hosted at many local and international film events.

Online reviews were generally favorable with universal <b>praise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> art, though opinions were mixed regarding the story's length, plot and emotional climax.|$|E
5|$|The {{worship of}} the lingam {{originated}} from the famous hymn in the Atharva-Veda Samhitâ sung in <b>praise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yupa-Stambha, the sacrificial post. In that hymn, a description is found of the beginningless and endless Stambha or Skambha, and it is shown that the said Skambha is put {{in place of the}} eternal Brahman. Just as the Yajna (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, ashes, and flames, the Soma plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the wood for the Vedic sacrifice gave place to the conceptions of the brightness of Shiva's body, his tawny matted hair, his blue throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the Yupa-Skambha gave place in time to the Shiva-Linga. In the text Linga Purana, the same hymn is expanded in the shape of stories, meant to establish the glory of the great Stambha and the superiority of Shiva as Mahadeva.|$|E

40|$|Many people sing <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neem tree, {{partly because}} of its insect {{repellent}} constituents. Rightfully so. However, its growing popularity is causing problems for fruit farmers with neem in the vicinity. Its insect repelling component (azadirachtin) keeps insects away, thus preventing pollination of nearby flowering fruit trees. In 2001, a mango plantation in Uganda failed to fruit after neem trees, planted in 1999, started to flower for the first time.
