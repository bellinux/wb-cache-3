In the case of perfect lattice the autocorrelation function oscillates on the lattice with the periodicity of the lattice and decays gradually up to about the third layer of the lattice points. In the case of neutral vacancies, the central peak expands significantly, but the nearest <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>dip</b> are greatly reduced.

40|$|Using {{the flux}} {{resolved}} spectroscopy {{for the first}} time, we analyse the RXTE/PCA data of the black hole X-ray binaries GRS 1915 + 105 and IGR J 17091 - 3624, when both sources show large amplitude, quasi-regular oscillations in 2. 0 - 60. 0 keV X-ray light curves. For different observations, we extract spectra during the <b>peak</b> (spectrally soft) <b>and</b> <b>dip</b> (spectrally hard) intervals of the oscillation, and find that their spectra are phenomenologically complex, requiring at least two distinct spectral components. Besides a thermal Comptonization component, {{we find that the}} disc emission is better modelled by an index-free multicolour disc blackbody component (p-free disc model) rather than that from a standard accretion disc. While the <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>dip</b> spectra are complex, remarkably, their difference spectra constructed by treating dip spectra as the background spectra of the peak spectra, can be modelled as a single p-free disc component. Moreover, the variability at different time-scales and energy bands of the peak flux level is always {{greater than or equal to}} the variability of the dip flux level, which strengthens the possibility that the peak flux level may be due to an independent spectral component added to the dip one. We also verify it using joint spectral analysis of <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>dip</b> spectra with a variable emission component. Our result substantiates the standard hypothesis that the oscillations are due to the limit cycle behaviour of an unstable radiation pressure dominated inner disc. However, in this interpretation, the flux variation of the unstable disc can be several order of magnitudes as expected from some theoretical simulations and need not be fine tuned to match the factor ~ 10 variation seen between the <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>dip</b> levels.

In this paper, an analytical vibroacoustic membrane model is developed to study sound transmission {{behavior of the}} MAM under a normal incidence. The MAM is composed of a prestretched elastic membrane with attached rigid masses. To accurately capture finite-dimension rigid mass effects on the membrane deformation, the point matching approach is adopted by applying a set of distributed point forces along the interfacial boundary between masses and the membrane. The accuracy and capability of the theoretical model is verified through the comparison with the finite element method. In particular, microstructure effects such as weight, size and eccentricity of the attached mass, pretension and thickness of the membrane on the resulting transmission <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> <b>dip</b> frequencies of the MAM are quantitatively investigated.

50|$|Measurements made at 2 or 3 m, in {{the actual}} {{listening}} position between two speakers can reveal something of what is actually going on in a listening room. Horrendous though the resulting curve generally appears to be (in comparison to other equipment), it provides a basis for experimentation with absorbent panels. Driving both speakers is recommended, as this stimulates low-frequency room ‘modes’ in a representative fashion. This means the microphone must be positioned precisely equidistant from the two speakers if ‘comb-filter’ effects (alternate <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> <b>dips</b> in the measured room response at that point) are to be avoided. Positioning is best done by moving the mic {{from side to side}} for maximum response on a 1 kHz tone, then a 3 kHz tone, then a 10 kHz tone.

5000|$|The company advocates {{the superiority}} of horns for the {{aforementioned}} properties, but historically horns {{have a reputation for}} a coloring of the sound sometimes described as [...] "honkiness".

[...] Klipsch subsequently introduced horns of braced fiberglass which were said to alleviate resonances that colored the earlier, metal designs.

5000|$|Early on, radio {{loudspeakers}} {{consisted of}} horns, often sold {{separately from the}} radio itself, (typically a small wood box containing the radio's electronic circuits), so they were not usually housed in an enclosure. [...] When paper cone loudspeaker drivers were introduced in the mid 1920s, radio cabinets began to be made larger to enclose both the electronics and the loudspeaker. [...] These cabinets were made largely {{for the sake of}} appearance, with the loudspeaker simply mounted behind a round hole in the cabinet. It was observed that the enclosure had a strong effect on the bass response of the speaker. Since the rear of the loudspeaker radiates sound out of phase from the front, there can be constructive and destructive interference for loudspeakers without enclosures, and below frequencies related to the baffle dimensions in open-baffled loudspeakers (described in Background section, below). This results in a loss of bass and comb filtering (i.e. response <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> <b>dips</b> in power regardless of the signal meant to be reproduced).Before the 1950s many manufacturers did not fully enclose their loudspeaker cabinets; the back of the cabinet was typically left open. This was done for several reasons, not least because electronics (at that time tube equipment) could be placed inside and cooled by convection in the open enclosure. [...] Most of the enclosure types discussed in this article were invented either to wall off the out of phase sound {{from one side of the}} driver, or to modify it so that it could be used to enhance the sound produced from the other side. However, a few designs have ventured in a different direction, attempting to incorporate the natural acoustic properties of the cabinet material rather than deaden it, and shape the cabinet so that the rear can remain open and still provide good bass response with limited comb filtering.|$|E
