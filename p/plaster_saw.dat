After the foot is manipulated, a long leg cast is applied to hold the correction. Initially, the short leg component is applied. The cast should be snug with minimal but adequate padding. The authors paint or spray the limb with tincture of benzoin to allow adherence of the padding to the limb. The authors prefer to apply additional padding strips along the medial and lateral borders to facilitate safe removal of the cast with a cast saw. The cast must incorporate the toes right up to the tips but not squeeze the toes or obliterate the transverse arch. The cast is molded to contour around the heel while abducting the forefoot against counter pressure on the lateral aspect of the head of the talus. The knee is flexed to 90° for the long leg component of the cast. The parents can soak these casts for 30-45 minutes prior to removal with a plaster knife. The authors' preferred method is to use the oscillating <b>plaster</b> <b>saw</b> for cast removal. The cast is bivalved and removed. The cast then is reconstituted by coapting the two halves. This allows for monitoring of the progress of the forefoot abduction and, in the later stages, the amount of dorsiflexion or equinus correction.|$|E
40|$|Model {{surgery is}} the dental cast version of cephalometric {{prediction}} of surgical results. Patients having vertical maxillary excess with prognathism invariably require Lefort I osteotomy with maxillary segmentation and maxillary first premolar extractions during surgery. Traditionally, model surgeries {{in these cases}} have been done by sawing the model through the first premolar interproximal area and removing that segment. This clinical innovation employed the use of X-ray film strips as separators in maxillary first premolar interproximal area. The method advocated is a time-saving procedure where no special clinical or laboratory tools, such as <b>plaster</b> <b>saw</b> (with accompanying plaster dust), were required and reusable separators were made from old and discarded X-ray films...|$|E

They rise to vaulted {{ceilings}} finished in deep-stained thin-width board with molded wood ribs and paterae at vault intersections. Flat surfaces between the roof and ceiling are marked by a plaster cornice. Circular fluted columns with similarly shaped capitals support the roof timber.|$|R
50|$|Tenant Houses (2) - Developer Winchester homes {{concluded}} that the wooden lath holding <b>plaster</b> was circular <b>sawn,</b> so the entire house was newer than 1850, and was not worth preservation, although {{the date of the}} plaster installation was undocumented.|$|R

Stryker, an {{orthopaedic}} surgeon from Kalamazoo, Michigan, filed for a US patent for his <b>plaster</b> cast cutting <b>saw.</b> The design used an oscillating saw design {{not unlike the}} mechanism used in modern oscillating saws used in construction.

50|$|Historically {{there were}} three ways of making wood lath for plaster: Riven lath is the {{stronger}} forerunner to sawn lath, as it was traditionally split with the grain from chestnut, oak, or similar hardwoods or softwoods like eastern white pine. Individual laths were riven and nailed in place; Accordion laths are thin, sawn boards partially split with a hatchet or axe and the splits spread apart to form gaps for the plaster to key into. The spreading action is like pulling an accordion open, thus the name; After the circular saw came into use in the early 19th century, lath for <b>plastering</b> was <b>sawn</b> in sawmills and delivered to the building site.|$|R

Uncle John saw the smoke swallow them up, saw Beth and Maud each busy with lint, <b>plasters</b> and bandages, <b>saw</b> Patsy supporting a tall, grizzled warrior who came limping toward the car. Then he turned and saw Doctor Gys, crouching low against the protecting sand, his disfigured face working convulsively and every limb trembling as with an ague.|$|R
50|$|The Laird of Lynn {{remembered his}} father's death bed advice {{and the small}} key he had been given, so in his despair sought out his last resort, the {{dilapidated}} cottage in the woods at Coal-heuch-glen. After much searching he found and entered the building, only to be greeted {{by the sight of}} a hangman's noose dangling from the ceiling. Convinced of his father's apparent message from the dead he put the rope around his neck, only to find himself falling to the floor and being rained upon by <b>plaster.</b> He <b>saw</b> a letter in his father's hand and this directed him to a corner of the cottage where behind two loose stones he found a chest full of silver and gold. A new wisdom, from an almost fatal lesson, guided the Laird of Linn {{for the rest of his}} days, living quietly, with many real friends to enjoy; dwelling in his ancestral home and upon his lands, bought back from that despairing traitor, Jock O' the Scales.|$|R
40|$|The {{airborne}} dust generated when cutting splinting bandages represents a potential respiratory hazard, particularly {{to those who}} regularly remove casts with a power <b>saw.</b> <b>Plaster</b> of Paris (POP) dust is already classified by the Health and Safety Executive as a nuisance dust. This paper reports on a study to determine the nature, size and concentration of dust produced when cutting polyurethane (PU) impregnated bandages using a power saw. It has been shown that, under severe conditions PU bandages produce lower {{airborne dust}} concentrations than POP bandage but {{that all of the}} bandages tested produced particles small enough to reach the final divisions of the lung. It is therefore recommended that a dust extraction unit be used when cutting all types of bandage...|$|R
60|$|Thirdly, while I {{disclaim}} {{the error}} of Stahl in deriving the phenomena of life from the unconscious actions of the rational soul, I repel with still greater earnestness the assertion and even the supposition that the functions are the offspring of the structure, and “Life(5) the result of organization,” connected with it as effect with cause. Nay, the position seems to me little less strange, than as if a man should say, that building with all the included handicraft, of <b>plastering,</b> <b>sawing,</b> planing, &c. were the offspring of the house; and that the mason and carpenter {{were the result of}} a suite of chambers, with the passages and staircases that lead to them. To make A the offspring of B, when the very existence of B as B presupposes the existence of A, is preposterous in the literal sense of the word, and a consummate instance of the hysteron proteron in logic. But if I reject the organ as the cause of that, of which it is the organ, though I might admit it among the conditions of its actual functions; for the same reason, I must reject fluids and ethers of all kinds, magnetical, electrical, and universal, to whatever quintessential thinness they may be treble distilled, and (as it were) super-substantiated. With these, I abjure likewise all chemical agencies, compositions, and decompositions, were it only that as stimulants they suppose a stimulability sui generis, which is but another paraphrase for life. Or if they are themselves at once both the excitant and the excitability, I miss the connecting link between this imaginary ether and the visible body, which then becomes no otherwise distinguished from inanimate matter, than by its juxtaposition in mere space, with an heterogeneous inmate, the cycle of whose actions revolves within itself. Besides which I should think that I was confounding metaphors and realities most absurdly, if I imagined that I had a greater insight into the meaning and possibility of a living alcohol, than of a living quicksilver. In short, visible surface and power of any kind, much more the power of life, are ideas which the very forms of the human understanding make it impossible to identify. But whether the powers which manifest themselves to us under certain conditions in the forms of electricity, or chemical attraction, have any analogy to the power which manifests itself in growth and organization, is altogether a different question, and demands altogether a different chain of reasoning: if it be indeed a tree of knowledge, it will be known by its fruits, and these will depends not on the mere assertion, but on the inductions by which the position is supported, and by the additions which it makes to our insight into the nature of the facts it is meant to illustrate.|$|R
5000|$|Workers began {{demolition}} on Saturday 9 December 1979. Newspaper {{reports indicate}} that seven or eight young men demolished the interior with sledge hammers, axes and chain <b>saws.</b> <b>Plaster</b> on the walls was broken up, the royal boxes destroyed, and seats either kicked in or thrown from the upper windows to the ground. The plaster decoration around the screen was destroyed although the ceiling remained intact on Monday 11 December. The University Senate stated that the trustees' architects had been on site to ensure that any items required for the redevelopment were retained. Some of the interior fittings were salvaged for local cinemas such as the Majestic Theatre at Pomona. The [...] "Save the Regent" [...] organisation complained to the Labour Relations Minister over the demolition and for breaches of the Construction Safety Act 1971, for which a prosecution was initiated in December 1979.|$|R
60|$|My {{sister had}} a trenchant way of cutting our {{bread and butter}} for us, that never varied. First, {{with her left hand}} she jammed the loaf hard and fast against her bib,--where it {{sometimes}} got a pin into it, and sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she took some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf, in an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,--using both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and moulding the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a final smart wipe {{on the edge of the}} <b>plaster,</b> and then <b>sawed</b> a very thick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.|$|R
6000|$|April 3d.--A {{few days}} ago we visited the studio of Mr. ------, an American, {{who seems to have}} a good deal of vogue as a sculptor. We found a figure of Pocahontas, which he has {{repeated}} several times; another, which he calls [...] "The Wept of the Wish-ton-Wish," [...] a figure of a smiling girl playing with a cat and dog, and a schoolboy mending a pen. These two last were the only ones that gave me any pleasure, or that really had any merit; for his cleverness and ingenuity appear in homely subjects, but are quite lost in attempts at a higher ideality. Nevertheless, he has a group of the Prodigal Son, possessing more merit than I should have expected from Mr. ------, the son reclining his head on his father's breast, with an expression of utter weariness, at length finding perfect rest, while the father bends his benign countenance over him, and seems to receive him calmly into himself. This group (the plaster-cast standing beside it) is now taking shape out of an immense block of marble, and will be as indestructible as the Laocoon; an idea at once awful and ludicrous, when we consider that it is at best but a respectable production. I have since been told that Mr. ------ had stolen, adopted, we will rather say, the attitude and idea of the group from one executed by a student of the French Academy, and to be seen there in <b>plaster.</b> (We afterwards <b>saw</b> it in the Medici Casino.) ...|$|R
