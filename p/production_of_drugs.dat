5|$|Lilly's {{greatest}} {{contributions to}} the industry were his standardized and methodical <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>drugs,</b> his dedication to research and development, and the therapeutic value of the drugs he created. As {{a pioneer in the}} modern pharmaceutical industry, many of his innovations later became standard practice. Lilly's ethical reforms, in a trade that was marked by outlandish claims of miracle medicines, began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs. During his lifetime, Lilly had advocated for federal regulation on medicines; his son, Josiah, continued that advocacy following his father's death.|$|E

Here, we describe a workflow for the application of C. elegans for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> metabolites, starting from well-plate screening assays leading to the preparative <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> metabolites using fungus immobilised either in alginate or as a biofilm. Using 12 - and 96 -well plates, the simultaneous screening <b>of</b> several <b>drug</b> biotransformations was achieved. To scale up the biotransformation, both modes of immobilisation enabled semi-continuous <b>production</b> <b>of</b> hydroxylated <b>drug</b> metabolites through repeated addition <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> and rejuvenation <b>of</b> the fungus. It was possible to improve the productivity in the biofilm culture for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> 4 ′-hydroxydiclofenac from 1 mg/l h to over 4 mg/l h by reducing the incubation time for biotransformation and the number of rejuvenation steps...|$|R

In addition, I try to define addiction, the personality <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> addict and I elaborate methods of Roznov Art Therapy. I will focus on the ontogeny of art expression and art typology. I draw individual workplaces that have inspired my reflections. What are the positives and the negatives of art methodological guidance? Are there any common features in the artifacts from both workplaces that we could not find in "normal"population? The practical part is based on my personal therapeutic experience with drug addicts. I try to find out typical moments in artistic <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> addicts {{and at the same time}} I use art production created by "normal" population. In the epilogue of this thesis, I compare the art <b>production</b> <b>of</b> drug-addicted clients with "normal" population.

40|$|Nanosizing is a {{suitable}} method {{to enhance the}} dissolution rate and therefore the bioavailability <b>of</b> poorly soluble <b>drugs.</b> The success <b>of</b> the particle size reduction processes depends on critical {{factors such as the}} employed technology, equipment, and drug physicochemical properties. High pressure homogenization and wet bead milling are standard comminution techniques that have been already employed to successfully formulate poorly soluble drugs and bring them to market. However, these techniques have limitations in their particle size reduction performance, such as long production times and the necessity of employing a micronized drug as the starting material. This review article discusses the development of combinative methods, such as the NANOEDGE, H 96, H 69, H 42, and CT technologies. These processes were developed to improve the particle size reduction effectiveness of the standard techniques. These novel technologies can combine bottom-up and/or top-down techniques in a two-step process. The combinative processes lead in general to improved particle size reduction effectiveness. Faster <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> nanocrystals and smaller final mean particle sizes are among the main advantages. The combinative particle size reduction technologies are very useful formulation tools, and they will continue acquiring importance for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> nanocrystals...|$|R
