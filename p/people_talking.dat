25|$|Another {{common form}} of synesthesia is the {{association}} of sounds with colors. For some, everyday sounds such as doors opening, cars honking, or <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> can trigger seeing colors. For others, colors are triggered when musical notes or keys are being played. People with synesthesia related to music may also have perfect pitch because their ability to see/hear colors aids them in identifying notes or keys.|$|E

25|$|The writing {{style of}} the lyrics is {{deliberately}} obscure; Oakey says this is because he wanted the band's lyrics to provoke thought and get <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> about their songs. Often the meanings behind the songs have only been disclosed by Oakey in various interviews given since the album's release. An {{important point is that}} the album essentially evolved during 1981 and wasn't written from a single conceptual starting point.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{comprehension}} {{and production of}} these few words demonstrated that she distinguished speech from other environmental sounds and could hear individual phonemes when listening to <b>people</b> <b>talking,</b> two critical early components of language acquisition. Nonetheless, based on their observations both Children's Hospital doctors and the linguists who later worked with her concluded {{that she had not}} acquired a first language during childhood. Due to the lack of physical or mental explanations for her lack of speech, Kent and Hansen attributed it to the extreme isolation of her childhood. Kent came away from his first encounters with Genie extremely pessimistic about her prognosis on all fronts.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} into how often gay men use homosexual slang terms that are often not understandable to those outside of the LGBT community. The particular slang used by gay men as well as lesbians has been recorded in a number of specialist dictionaries, and according to researcher Greg Jacobs, is that the terminology listed in said dictionaries revolves heavily around sexual matters including terms for sex organs, preferences and activities, although Jacobs questions whether this accurately reflects {{the amount of time spent}} by gay <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> about sex and sexuality or whether it is down to methodological assumptions that conversations amongst LGBT people is primarily dominated with talk about sex.|$|E

25|$|A mild form of {{hallucination}} {{is known}} as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises and/or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject good things about themselves) or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. Auditory hallucinations of the malicious type are frequently heard, for example <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> about the subject behind his/her back. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.|$|E
25|$|Marilyn taught Genie to {{take her}} {{frustration}} out on inanimate objects in their yard and worked to verbally deescalate her, and as Genie learned more language she began to gain more control over her responses to situations that upset her. By {{the end of her}} stay with the Riglers she could gesture to indicate her level of anger, either vigorously shaking one finger or loosely waving her hand depending on whether she was very angry or merely frustrated. In mid-October 1971 Curtiss was reading Genie a story when she saw Genie was clearly listening and responding, and from then on Genie paid attention to <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. As she settled down with the Riglers she began to talk somewhat more, and her response time began to improve, but she continued to speak significantly less than most children in similar phases of language learning.|$|E
500|$|To {{produce and}} direct the show, Wood chose Geoff Posner, who had {{previously}} worked on successful and acclaimed British comedy shows of the early 1980s such as Not The Nine O'Clock News, The Young Ones and the pilot of Blackadder. Equally impressed with her work, Posner said of Wood's gift for comedy, [...] "She manages to examine <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> and capture speech-patterns and subjects that are everyday, but hysterical at the same time... it's quite unique to hold a mirror up to ordinary life and make it so special." ...|$|E

500|$|Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy {{wrote that}} despite a [...] "surging power-pop chorus", [...] "Little Miss Obsessive" [...] lacks [...] "the wow factor" [...] {{required}} to [...] "get <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> about Simpson's music again". Glenn Gamboa of Newsday called [...] "Little Miss Obsessive" [...] a [...] "passable Pinkish pop" [...] song, but {{stated that it}} isn't enough to keep Bittersweet World from [...] "going sour". Nick Levine of Digital Spy wrote that Simpson's voice is [...] "insufficiently meaty" [...] {{to be able to}} sing the song. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song [...] "quite awful", writing that exploring [...] "the endless possibilities of the word 'over' in the chorus" [...] is [...] "a bit of a slog".|$|E
500|$|Fincher had {{previously}} worked with director of photography Harris Savides on Seven (he shot the opening credits) and The Game. Savides loved the script but realized, [...] "there {{was so much}} exposition, just <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> on the phone or having conversations. It was difficult to imagine {{how it could be}} done in a visual way." [...] Fincher and Savides did not want to repeat the look of Seven. The director's approach to Zodiac was to create a look mundane enough that audiences would accept that what they were watching was the truth. The filmmakers also did not want to glamorize the killer or tell the story through his eyes. [...] "That would have turned the story into a first-person-shooter video game. We didn't want to make the sort of movie that serial killers would want to own," [...] Fincher said.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate has}} been widely criticized for its {{adversarial}} tone. David Berube in Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz characterized it as [...] "two <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> over each other... not conducive to reasonable rebuttal," [...] and quoted nanotechnology blogger and journalist Howard Lovy as saying [...] "the tenor of the debate is about personal pride, reputation, and {{a place in the}} pantheon." [...] Zyvex founder James von Ehr remarked that [...] "Eric [...] didn't do himself any favors by getting into a pissing match with a Nobel-prize winner." [...] An article in The New York Times called the debate [...] "reminiscent of that old Saturday Night Live sketch... Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin tossing insults at each other while ostensibly debating a serious political issue," [...] referring to a version of the long-running Weekend Update segment.|$|E

500|$|According to Carter, it {{was evident}} that The X-Files was a [...] "series in making" [...] during this episode. The episode was {{inspired}} by common ufology. Believers in aliens have long thought that Nevada's Area 51 and Nellis Air Force Base have alien technology captured during 1947's Roswell UFO incident. The name Ellens Air Force Base was derived from the name of Carter's college girlfriend, whose last name was Ellens. The story's military project was inspired by a rumor that the United States Air Force had started a project named the Aurora Project. Carter said he remembered <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> about this rumor and that its inclusion in the story was a [...] "nod" [...] to it. The surname for the two guest characters, Budahas, came from a high school friend of Carter. Duchovny and Anderson had never used a gun or held one before, so they were trained on how to hold them properly.|$|E
500|$|The biggest {{studio in}} the low-budget field {{remained}} a leader in exploitation's growth. In 1973, American International gave a shot to young director Brian De Palma. Reviewing Sisters, Pauline Kael observed that its [...] "limp technique doesn't seem to matter {{to the people who}} want their gratuitous gore.... e can't get two <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> {{in order to make a}} simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938." [...] Many examples of the blaxploitation genre, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was Pam Grier, who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970). Several New World pictures followed, including The Big Doll House (1971) and The Big Bird Cage (1972), both directed by Jack Hill. Hill also directed her best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974).|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Yori and her user, Dr. Lora Baines, {{do not appear}} in the sequel, even though the film refers to Alan Bradley being married to Lora. Fans have lobbied for actress Cindy Morgan to be in the film with active campaigns online, such as [...] "Yori Lives" [...] on Facebook, which is independent of Morgan herself. [...] "All I know is what I'm seeing online," [...] Morgan said. [...] "I am so thrilled and touched and excited about the fan reaction and about <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> about the first one and how it relates to the second one. I can't tell you how warm a feeling I get from that. It just means so much." [...] No one from Tron: Legacy had contacted Morgan, and she did not directly speak with anyone from the sequel's cast and crew. As Dr. Lora Baines, Cindy Morgan had appeared with Bruce Boxleitner (as Alan Bradley) at the Encom Press Conference in San Francisco, April 2, 2010.|$|E

500|$|The {{couple were}} {{separated}} {{for long periods}} at a time, as Dash recalled that Aaliyah continuously shot films and would be gone for months often to come back shortly and continue her schedule. Dash was also committed to [...] "his own thing", which did not make matters any better. Despite this, they were understanding that {{the time they had}} together was special. Dash remembered they would [...] "be {{in a room full of}} <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> to each other and it felt like everyone was listening but it would be just us. It would be like we were the only ones in the room". Dash always felt their time together was essential and Aaliyah was the person he was interested in being with, which is why, as he claimed, they had begun speaking about engagement. The relationship was mentioned in the lyrics of Jay-Z's remix to her song [...] "Miss You", released after her death.|$|E
500|$|On the {{day before}} the invasion, US President Gerald R. Ford and US Secretary of State Henry A.

In response to Suharto saying [...] "We want your understanding if it was deemed necessary to take rapid or drastic action [...]" [...] Ford replied, [...] "We will understand and will not press you on the issue. We understand the problem and the intentions you have." [...] Kissinger similarly agreed, though he had fears that the use of U.S.-made arms in the invasion would be exposed to public scrutiny, talking of their desire to [...] "influence the reaction in America" [...] so that [...] "there would be less chance of <b>people</b> <b>talking</b> in an unauthorised way." [...] The US also hoped the invasion would be swift and not involve protracted resistance. [...] "It is important that whatever you do succeeds quickly," [...] Kissinger said to Suharto.|$|E
500|$|Despite this assessment, {{the end of}} the show's {{fourth season}} saw Hahn grow closer to {{orthopedic}} surgeon Callie Torres, in a relationship dubbed [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes has stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry. And watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." [...] She has explained that in developing the relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get <b>people</b> <b>talking.</b> [...] We wanted {{to see what would happen}} if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of season finale, with which After Ellen have noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." ...|$|E
