40|$|The {{buffering}} {{of indoor}} humidity fluctuations {{can lead to}} more hygienic and comfortable conditions in residential buildings. In order to quantify the hygric buffering capacity of wood based wall and ceiling panels under realistic and well-defined boundary conditions, two identical test rooms were set-up. Both rooms have a door and a window and an inert PVC floor covering. One room serves as test room and the other as reference room. The walls and ceiling of the reference room are covered with a traditional interior plaster coated with a vapour permeable (sd= 0. 15 m) film of paint. The interior plaster of the test room is completely covered by aluminum foil. Both rooms are equipped with temperature and humidity sensors, calibrated ventilation systems and vapour <b>production</b> <b>apparatuses.</b> While temperature set-points, ventilation and moisture production rate are well defined, the exterior climate conditions cannot be controlled. Therefore, only comparative test can give reliable results. All investigations were done by measuring the indoor humidity in both rooms simultaneously.

40|$|The perceptual and {{physiological}} {{characteristics of the}} speech of a nine year old child who suffered a basilar artery stroke {{at the age of}} five years were investigated using a battery of perceptual {{and physiological}} instrumental measures. Perceptual tests administered included the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment, a perceptual analysis of a speech sample based on a reading of the Grandfather Passage and a phonetic intelligibility test. Instrumental procedures included: spirometric and kinematic analysis of speech breathing; electroglottographic evaluation of laryngeal function, nasometric assessment of velopharyngeal function and evaluation of lip and tongue function using pressure transducers. Physiological assessment indicated the most severe deficits to be in the respiratory and velopharyngeal sub-systems with significant deficits in the articulatory sub-system, all of which resulted in severely reduced intelligibility. These results were compared and contrasted with the subject 2 ̆ 7 s performance on the perceptual assessment battery.
