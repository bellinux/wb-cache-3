40|$|Protein misfolding {{is common}} across many {{neurodegenerative}} diseases, with misfolded proteins acting as seeds for "prion-like" conversion of normally folded protein to abnormal conformations. A central {{hypothesis is that}} misfolded protein accumulation, spread and distribution is restricted to specific neuronal populations of {{the central nervous system}} and thus predict regions of neurodegeneration. We examined this hypothesis using a highly sensitive assay system for detection of misfolded <b>protein</b> <b>seeds</b> in a murine model of prion disease. Misfolded prion <b>protein</b> <b>seeds</b> were observed widespread throughout the brain accumulating in all brain regions examined irrespective of neurodegeneration. Importantly neither time of exposure nor amount of misfolded <b>protein</b> <b>seeds</b> present determined regions of neurodegeneration. We further demonstrate two distinct microglia responses in prion infected brains, a 11 novel homeostatic response in all regions and an innate immune response restricted to sites of 12 neurodegeneration. Therefore accumulation of misfolded prion protein alone does not define targeting 13 of neurodegeneration which instead results only when misfolded prion protein accompanies a specific 14 innate immune response...|$|E

40|$|Seed of a Mexican semidwarf wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Inia 66), was {{obtained}} from a nitrogen fertilizer field trial grown in Mexico. A high positive correlation {{was obtained}} between seed protein content and seedling dry weight after 3 weeks growth (r = + 0. 92 **). The seedling dry weight {{was positively related to}} the protein content of the aleurone layer and endosperm, but not to the embryo. Small, 35 milligrams, high <b>protein</b> <b>seeds</b> (4. 7 milligrams protein per seed) produced larger seedlings than large, 45 milligrams, low <b>protein</b> <b>seeds</b> (4. 3 milligram protein per seed). There was no difference in the weight or protein content of embryos from low and high <b>protein</b> <b>seeds</b> and their growth was similar. Composite seeds of the two protein levels were produced by transferring embryos from one endosperm type to the other. After 4 weeks, {{there was no difference between}} the different embryo types grown on the same endosperm type.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 High protein wheat seeds {{frequently}} {{perform better}} than low <b>protein</b> <b>seeds</b> {{of the same}} variety. Protein content of seeds can be increased by management practices, {{the most important of}} which is rate and timing of N applications. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the chemical, biochemical and physiological changes that occur in seeds as a result of nitrogen fertilization, and to relate these changes to seed performance. Seeds of Yamhill, Paha and Hyslop soft white winter wheat were produced with N applications of 0 to 450 kg/ha. Applications were made at planting, flower initiation, and anthesis. Supplemental irrigation was supplied. Applications of 150 and 300 kg N /ha increased the grain yield and protein yield per hectare, seed size, and percent and amount of protein per seed of Yamhill wheat. N applications caused several biochemical changes in the food reserve of the seeds. These included increases in the amounts of gluten, each amino acid studied and free amino acids. The amount of soluble sugars decreased slightly and starch remained constant with high rates of N. N also caused several biochemical changes in embryos. These included increases in: free amino acids and soluble sugars; protein concentrations and amount per embryo; ADP, ATP and energy charge. Regardless of protein concentration, the quantities of solubles and adenylate phosphates were higher in larger embryos. Biochemical changes in seedlings associated with N applications and higher protein content included: more sugars and free amino acids; higher amounts of ATP, ADP and total AP; and faster rate and higher net translocation of food reserves. Small seeds contained a higher concentration of ash, some mineral elements, soluble sugars and free amino acids. The total amount of these compounds per seed, however, was related to protein content and seed size. The large seeds with high protein concentration produced seedlings with the highest ADP, ATP and total AP content, energy charge and growth potential. Smaller seeds absorbed water and germinated faster than larger seeds. Seedlings from small seeds produced longer roots and shoots during the early stages of growth, but their growth rate was slower at later stages.

Under dry conditions this may also prevent excessive moisture loss, improving the prospects of early germination and growth. However, under very wet conditions, and where soil structure has been damaged, ploughing may still be the most appropriate strategy, to accelerate drainage, facilitate soil drying and remove compaction.

Phenolic compounds increased their concentration since the first germination day reaching until 450 % more than the original seed level.

40|$|ABSTRACT In carrot seed production, {{harvesting}} of the umbels {{is generally}} staggered, or sometimes the whole plant is harvested with the umbels {{at different stages}} of maturation; in that case, there is a risk of harvesting immature seeds and of losses due to natural dehiscent, or to physiological deterioration as a result of unfavourable environmental factors. The present study aimed to evaluate the physiological and biochemical changes related to the maturation of 'Planalto' carrot seeds from diferent umbels. The samples were collected 120 days after anthesis, with the primary, secondary and tertiary umbels being harvested separately. Seeds were analysed for germination, first count and germination rate, at temperatures of 25 ºC (optimum) to 35 ºC (adverse), as well as for emergence in the greenhouse and the emergence rate.

A molecular mechanism referred to as “nucleation-dependent aggregation” is thought to underlie this neuropathological phenomenon. According to this concept, disease-associated protein particles act as nuclei, or seeds, that recruit cellular proteins and incorporate them, in a misfolded form, into their growing aggregate structure. Experimental {{studies have shown that the}} aggregation of the AD-associated proteins amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, and of the PD-associated protein α-synuclein, can be stimulated in laboratory animal models by intracerebral (i. c.) injection of inocula containing aggregated species of the respective proteins.

While the i. c. injection of inocula containing AD- or PD-associated protein aggregates was found to cause neuronal damage and clinical abnormalities (e. g., motor impairments) in some animal models, none of the studies published so far provided evidence for a transmission of severe or even fatal disease. In addition, available epidemiological data do not indicate a transmissibility of AD or PD between humans.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of seed protein content on plant growth of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The effects of nitrogen application on chemical and morphological characteristics of the seed were also studied. Seeds of 'Casbon' winter barley and 'Nugaines' winter wheat with different protein content were obtained by field applications of various amounts of nitrogen at seeding time (fall) and tillering time (spring). The increase in protein content from high nitrogen rates was accompanied by a decrease in seed size and yield. The protein increase occurred primarily in the endosperm. Neither protein content nor size of the embryo was affected by rates of nitrogen application. The effect of seed protein content on plant growth was evaluated in terms of inhibition and respiration, speed of germination and subsequent seedling growth, root and shoot elongation at 15, 20 and 25 C, and dry matter production when grown in low and high nitrogen soils in the green house. A positive relationship was found between seed protein content and plant performance. The rates of water absorption and oxygen consumption of germinating barley and wheat seed increased as a result of high protein content. High protein seed had a faster speed of germination and developed into larger seedlings with a higher dry matter content when grown in nitrogen-deficient soil. In nitrogen-enriched soil, seed protein content had little effect on seedling growth. The beneficial effects of seed protein content are more clearly expressed under stress conditions and are more evident when plant growth depends on the nutrients available from the seed. During initiation of germination, temperature influences the expression of the protein effect. After the seedling has formed and is capable of photosynthesis, the nitrogen availability in the soil influences the effect of seed protein content on plant growth. The relationship between seed protein content and plant growth can be an important factor in crop production because the increase in protein can be controlled by field application of nitrogen. However, since the high rates of nitrogen necessary to produce high seed protein levels are not consistent with the optimum nitrogen rates for yield, growers would probably be reluctant to apply such high rates unless some type of incentive were given them to do so. For seed production, it could still be important to strive for high protein levels in spite of some loss in yield if improved performance from high <b>protein</b> <b>seeds</b> proves to be of economic value. The results of this study indicate that producing and planting seeds rich in protein may be an effective method of achieving faster stand establishment of cereal crops. Additional research will determine the effects of high protein on yield...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthetic}} of antioxidant peptides from melinjo (Gnetum gnemon) <b>seed</b> <b>protein</b> isolated using sol-gel immobilized alcalase was studied, {{a commercial}} alcalase was physically entrapped in sol-gel matrices system. Characteristics of protein hydrolyzed {{were evaluated by}} the degree of hydrolysis obtained (DH) and the peptide profile by FPLC and SDS-PAGE. The antioxidant activity of protein hydrolyzed was determined using ABTS cation, DPPH, and superoxide radical scavenging assays. The DH values increased very quickly during the second hour followed by a slow increase up to 12 hours. Melinjo <b>seed</b> <b>protein</b> isolated was hydrolyzed about 23 % of degree hydrolysis at 50 °C after 2 hours of incubation. Similar results were also obtained by FPLC and SDS-PAGE, the peptide profile indicated the sol-gel immobilized alcalase was produced of peptides with low molecular weight from melinjo <b>seed</b> <b>protein</b> isolated. Immobilized alcalase preserved the initial activity over 4 cycles of repeated use in a routine reaction. The ABTS assay, the hydrolysate presented a more than   5 times greater activity than non-hydrolyzed melinjo <b>seed</b> <b>protein</b> isolated. It's confirming the potential use of sol-gel immobilized alcalase in synthetic antioxidant peptides from melinjo <b>seed</b> <b>protein</b> isolated.  </p...|$|R
