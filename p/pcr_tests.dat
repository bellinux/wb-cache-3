25|$|Sentinel {{lymph node}} biopsy is often performed, {{especially}} for T1b/T2+ tumors, mucosal tumors, ocular melanoma and tumors of the limbs. A process called lymphoscintigraphy is performed in which a radioactive tracer is injected at the tumor site to localize the sentinel node(s). Further precision is provided using a blue tracer dye, and surgery is performed to biopsy the node(s). Routine hematoxylin and eosin (H) and immunoperoxidase staining will be adequate to rule out node involvement. Polymerase chain reaction (<b>PCR)</b> <b>tests</b> on nodes, usually performed to test for entry into clinical trials, now demonstrate that many patients with a negative sentinel lymph node actually had {{a small number of}} positive cells in their nodes. Alternatively, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy may be performed and is often used to test masses.|$|E

40|$|The EURTAC trial {{demonstrated}} that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib was superior to chemotherapy as first-line therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) that harbor EGFR activating mutations in a predominantly Caucasian population. Based on EURTAC and several Asian trials, anti-EGFR TKIs are standard of care for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. We sought to validate a rapid multiplex EGFR mutation assay as a companion diagnostic assay to select patients for this therapy. Samples from the EURTAC trial were prospectively screened for EGFR mutations {{using a combination of}} laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), and tested retrospectively with the cobas EGFR mutation <b>test</b> (EGFR <b>PCR</b> <b>test).</b> The EGFR <b>PCR</b> <b>test</b> results were compared to the original LDT results and to Sanger sequencing, using a subset of specimens from patients screened for the trial.

2500|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (or HIV), is a difficult target to find and eradicate. The earliest tests for infection relied {{on the presence of}} antibodies to the virus circulating in the bloodstream. [...] However, antibodies don't appear until many weeks after infection, maternal antibodies mask the infection of a newborn, and therapeutic agents to fight the infection don't affect the antibodies. [...] <b>PCR</b> <b>tests</b> have been developed that can detect as little as one viral genome among the DNA of over 50,000 host cells.

2500|$|Thrombocytopenia {{that starts}} {{after the first}} 72 hours since birth is often the result of {{underlying}} sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). In the case of infection, <b>PCR</b> <b>tests</b> may be useful for rapid pathogen identification and detection of antibiotic resistance genes. [...] Possible pathogens include viruses (e.g. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella virus, HIV), bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica), fungi (e.g. Candida sp.), and Toxoplasma gondii. The severity of thrombocytopenia may be correlated with pathogen type; some research indicates that the most severe cases are related to fungal or gram-negative bacterial infection. The pathogen may be transmitted during or before birth, by breast feeding, or during transfusion. Interleukin-11 is being investigated as a drug for managing thrombocytopenia, especially in cases of sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).|$|E
40|$|Toxin-based {{identification}} {{procedures are}} useful for differentiating Pseudomonas syringae pathovars. A biological test on peptone-glucose-NaCl agar in which the yeast Rhodotorula pilimanae was used {{proved to be more}} reliable for detecting lipodepsipeptide-producing strains of P. syringae than the more usual test on potato dextrose agar in which Geotrichum candidum is used. A <b>PCR</b> <b>test</b> performed with primers designed to amplify a 1, 040 -bp fragment in the coding sequence of the syrD gene, which was assumed to be involved in syringomycin and syringopeptin secretion, efficiently detected the gene in pathovars that produce the lipodepsipeptides. Comparable results were obtained in both tests performed with strains of the syringomycin-producing organisms P. syringae pv. syringae, P. syringae pv. atrofaciens, and P. syringae pv. aptata, but the <b>PCR</b> <b>test</b> failed with a syringotoxin-producing Pseudomonas fuscovaginae strain. The specificity of the test was verified by obtaining negative <b>PCR</b> <b>test</b> results for related pathovars or species that do not produce the toxic lipodepsipeptides. P. syringae pv. syringae was detected repeatedly in liquid medium inoculated with diseased vegetative tissue and assayed by the <b>PCR</b> <b>test.</b> Our procedure was also adapted to detect P. syringae pv. morsprunorum with a cfl gene-based <b>PCR</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{real-time}} {{reverse transcription}} {{polymerase chain reaction}} assay (<b>PCR</b> <b>test)</b> based on genome segment 10 of Bluetongue virus (BTV) was developed. The <b>PCR</b> <b>test</b> consists of robotized viral RNA isolation from blood samples and an all-in-one method including initial denaturation of genomic double-stranded RNA, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and real-time detection and analysis. Reference strains of the 24 recognized BTV serotypes, isolates from different years, and geographic origins were detected. Other orbiviruses such as African horse sickness virus, Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, and Equine encephalosis virus were not detected. Experimentally infected animals were PCR positive from 2 days postinoculation, which was earlier than fever, other clinical signs, or seroconversion. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were very close to or even 100 %. The <b>PCR</b> <b>test</b> {{played a key role}} in the detection of BTV serotype 8 in August 2006 in The Netherlands.

Primers specific for serotypes 2, 5, and 6 were combined with the already existing species-specific primers used in a <b>PCR</b> <b>test</b> based on the omlA gene. The <b>PCR</b> <b>test</b> was evaluated with serotype reference strains of A. pleuropneumoniae as well as 182 Danish field isolates previously serotyped by latex agglutination or immunodiffusion. For all serologically typeable strains, a complete correspondence {{was found between the}} results obtained by the multiplex <b>PCR</b> <b>test</b> and the results obtained by the traditional serotyping methods. Six of eight serologically nontypeable strains could be allocated to a serotype {{on the basis of the}} multiplex PCR results. The species specificity of the assay was evaluated with a collection of 93 strains representing 29 different species within the family Pasteurellaceae, as well as species normally found in the respiratory tracts of swine. All of these strains were negative by the multiplex <b>PCR</b> <b>test,</b> including 50 field isolates of the phylogenetically closely related species Actinobacillus lignieresii. When the multiplex <b>PCR</b> <b>test</b> was used to test Danish field strains, it was able to identify the serotypes of approximately 94 % of all strains isolated from swine with clinical disease. More than 90 % of the isolates that cross-reacted by the latex agglutination test were of serotype 2, 5, or 6.

Some laboratory tests, such as culture, are not entirely satisfying. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare RUT with PCR in identifying H. pylori in the gastric biopsy tissue samples. Materials & Methods: First, the standard H. pylori sample (N:oC 30) was provided. primers or the glmM (ureC) gene were used In PCR method The <b>PCR</b> <b>test</b> was optimized by sensitivity and specificity methods. Then 100 clinical samples composed of stomach tissue biopsy were prepared. The rapid urease test was conducted on all obtained samples to identify H. pylori. DNA was extracted from samples using DNG plus technique. Then, samples were studied using PCR method.   Results: The 294 bp product was amplified in the optimized <b>PCR</b> <b>test.</b> The <b>PCR</b> <b>test</b> sensitivity was obtained at 10 CFU. Any unwanted products were not seen in the specificity test with the exception of H. pylori DNA samples. Of 100 stomach biopsy samples, 64 % were reported as positive by RUT and 76 % by the <b>PCR</b> <b>test.</b> Conclusion: Given that the <b>PCR</b> <b>test</b> has higher sensitivity and specificity to detect H. pylori comparing rapid ureaas test, therefore this method could be used to detect H. pylori. ...|$|R
