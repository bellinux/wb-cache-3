40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} are the predominated cultures in fermented dairy products. These bacteria primarily used for acidification {{of milk and}} covert them into different valuable foods. They also produced different secondary metabolites like bacteriocin applied as natural preservatives. In the present investigation, these lactic acid bacteria were isolated and characterized for the bacteriocin production and their metabolic compounds were applied for the bio preservation of dairy products. In the first phase, isolated lactic acid bacteria were categorized in three genera as lactobacilli (71 %), followed by streptococci (24 %) and lactococci (5 %) and eleven different species. The species of these bacteria were Lactobacillus bulgaricus (17. 5 %), Lactobacillus acidophilus (16. 3 %) and Streptococcus thermophilus (13. 8 %). In the second phase, all identified strains of lactic acid bacteria were screened for their antibacterial activity and {{it was observed that}} three species via L. acidophilus LA 06 FT, L. bulgaricus TLB 06 FT and S. thermophilus S 02 FT have maximum inhibitory effects against different food pathogens. The maximum yield of bacteriocin was obtained on growth media containing 1 % tryptone, NaCl, tween 80 and yeast extract and 2 % glucose or lactose at 37 oC. After optimizing the growth conditions for these three selected strains, their probiotic potential was explored and it was observed that L. acidophilus LA 06 FT survived in 2 - 3 % bile salts for the period of 6 h but L. bulgaricus TLB 06 FT and S. thermophilus S 02 FT can only remain viable in 1 % bile salt concentration. Furthermore, bacteriocin produced by L. acidophilus LA 06 FT was heat resistant at 90 oC, inhibited by proteinases, performed well over a wide range of pH (3. 5 - 7. 5). The bacteriocin produced by L. acidophilus LA 06 FT was further purified initially by micro-filtration and then precipitation by ammonium sulfate and dialysis through 12000 Da cut-off membranes having molecular weight (8. 5 kDa). In the third phase molecular characterization of selected probiotic strains was carried out. Firstly, protein profile of all selected strains was determined and it was observed that L. acidophilus have 6 prominent bands at 80, 62. 2, 45, 35, 24 and 14. 4 kDa along some minor ones. L. bulgaricus had shown nine prominent bands at 14, 18, 25, 38, 37, 48, 50, 62 and 69 kDa along some minor one. Similarly, S. thermophilus revealed 9 to 14 protein bands. In order to determine the similarity index among the collected strains hierarchal clusters analysis was carried out. Plasmid isolation and its restriction digestion were also performed and it was observed that some bacteriocin producing strains have single prominent band of 10 kbp. In addition, amplification of 16 S rDNA regains of these strains was carried out by species-specific primers and using their genomic DNA as template to get PCR products of approximately 200 bp to 250 bp. In the last phase, probiotic yoghurt was made in three combinations by using L. acidophilus LA 06 FT, L. bulgaricus TLB 06 FT, S. thermophilus S 02 FT being high bacteriocin producer and appreciable probiotic properties along with control. It was observed in a preparation Y 3 (1 : 1 : 1) stood best for all set parameters. In the second part of this phase, cellulose based <b>packaging</b> <b>sheet</b> was developed by coating with the purified bacteriocin and subsequently wrapping of butter whereas cellulose sheet without anti-microbial compound was used as control. It was noted that acidity, pH and viable count of control sample changed significantly during storage indicating high level of microbial activities as compared to coated one. In conclusion, dahi is a rich source of probiotic lactic bacteria that produced different antibacterial compounds effective against food borne pathogens. Results obtained were also help to modified the traditional preservation methods in which bacteriocin was applied along with cellulose packaging...|$|E

The loss of stability of plastic properties is {{the criterion of}} evaluation of plastic properties of steel sheets in most cases. The loss of stability of plastic properties depends on stress-strain scheme in real conditions of deep drawing of sheets. In the contribution will be evaluated the loss of plastic properties stability of thin double reduced <b>packaging</b> <b>sheets</b> made from low carbon steels. For evaluation of strength and plastic properties of thin <b>packaging</b> <b>sheets</b> is the tensile test most used at present. The material is stressed by uniaxial tension during this test. In the conditions of technological processes of drawing, which thin <b>packaging</b> <b>sheets</b> are mostly treating, is this way of stress not very objective. In most cases it deals about multiaxial stress of sheet by deformation of sheet to require draw cup. At the present, the biggest problem of thin steel sheets by uniaxial tension test evaluation {{is the loss of}} plastic deformation stability (localization of plastic deformation). Therefore, obtained results of plastic deformation during this test do not correspond with real plastic properties of thin steel sheets. In the contribution, will be compared the evaluation of plastic properties of these sheets by uniaxial and biaxial load.

These materials behave differently in production and end use and are therefore subject of extensive studies. The aim of this research is to understand the influence of deformation of pre-coated <b>packaging</b> steel <b>sheet</b> on real can product behaviour. The following issues and their mutual relations were addressed: deformation in the substrate and coating and its influence on interaction at the interface, the morphology of the coating, failure mechanisms of the product, and ionic transport through the coating. The research showed that the interface between substrate and coating undergoes large changes during the can making process. The initial very strong coating adhesion is reduced significantly after deformation. The reduction of the coating adhesion can be explained by change in surface morphology of the outer substrate layer as a result of tilting of the steel grains causing stress build-up in the coating. The effects of substrate and coating changes of deformed polymer coated packaging steel on the performance were studied in detail. A relation was found between product performance and the change in surface morphology of the outer substrate layer due to deformation. Mechanical Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

In principle, the benefit of the usage of open celled foams as heat insulation is twofold: Firstly, to the mass of the heat shields is reduced considerably and thus the production costs are expected to decrease. Secondly, it is expected, that better heat insulation capability may result in lower energy consumption of the furnaces. In conclusion, the project shows that open celled foams out of molybdenum are a potent substitute for conventional radiation sheet heat insulation. Since the masses of the Mo-foams is distinctly lower than that one of the radiation sheets, it is expected, that the use of foams as heat insulation will noticeably reduce production costs...|$|R
