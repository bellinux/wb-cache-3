50|$|<b>Pole-and-line</b> <b>fishing</b> {{is still}} carried out {{today in the}} Maldives, Ghana, the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Azores. Few pole-and-line boats now {{specifically}} target yellowfin, an incidental take compared to the total commercial catch. In the Maldives, the catch {{is a mix of}} skipjack tuna and small yellowfins that often associate with them.|$|E
50|$|Formerly, {{much of the}} {{commercial}} catch was made by <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>fishing,</b> using live bait such as anchovy to attract schools of tuna close to the fishing vessel that were then taken with baited jigs on sturdy bamboo or fiberglass poles or on handlines. This fishery, which targeted skipjack and occasionally albacore, as well as yellowfin, for canning, reached its heyday between World War I and the 1950s before declining. The most well-known fleet of pole-and-line boats sailed from San Diego in California and exploited abundant stocks in Mexican waters, as well as further south to Panama, Costa Rica, and the Galapagos Islands.|$|E
40|$|A {{review is}} given of current {{information}} concerning small pelagic fishes exploited for tuna bait in the South Pacific. These fishes are usually caught over or near coral reefs using light attraction and lift nets. The {{most common and}} widespread species are anchovies (Engraulidae), sprats (Clupeidae), silversides (Atherinidae), and herrings (Clupeidae). Recorded yields ranged from 0. 5 to 2. 6 t/km 2, and methods are described to estimate potential yields empirically {{in the absence of}} catch data. Environmental effects on small pelagic fish production are discussed, and evidence is presented to suggest that rainfall markedly affects stolephorid anchovy production. Some species of small pelagic fish, such as Selar spp., Decapterus spp., and Herklotsichthys sp., have been fished traditionally by artisanal fishermen, but anchovy and sprat stocks were probably unexploited prior to <b>pole-and-line</b> tuna <b>fishing</b> in the South Pacific...|$|R
40|$|Tropical tuna {{fisheries}} {{are among}} the largest worldwide, with some having significant bycatch issues. However, pole-and-line tuna fisheries are widely believed to have low bycatch rates, although these have rarely been quantified. The Maldives has an important pole-and-line fishery, targeting skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). In the Maldives, 106 <b>pole-and-line</b> tuna <b>fishing</b> days were observed between August 2014 and November 2015. During 161 fishing events, tuna catches amounted to 147 t: 72 % by weight was skipjack, 25 % yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and 3 % other tunas. Bycatch (all non-tuna species caught plus all tuna discards) amounted to 951 kg (0. 65 % of total tuna catch). Most of the bycatch (95 %) was utilized, and some bycatch was released alive, so dead discards were particularly low (0. 02 % of total tuna catch, or 22 kg per 100 t). Rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata) and dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) together constituted 93 % of the bycatch. Live releases included small numbers of silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) and seabirds (noddies, Anous tenuirostris and A. stolidus). <b>Pole-and-line</b> tuna <b>fishing</b> was conducted on free schools and schools associated with various objects (Maldivian anchored fish aggregating devices [aFADs], drifting FADs from western Indian Ocean purse seine fisheries, other drifting objects and seamounts). Free school catches typically included {{a high proportion of}} large skipjack and significantly less bycatch. Associated schools produced more variable tuna catches and higher bycatch rates. Fishing trips in the south had significantly lower bycatch rates than those in the north. This study is the first to quantify bycatch rates in the Maldives pole-and-line tuna fishery and the influence of school association on catch composition. Ratio estimator methods suggest roughly 552. 6 t of bycatch and 27. 9 t of discards are caught annually in the fishery (based on 2015 national catch), much less than other Indian Ocean tuna fisheries, e. g. gillnet, purse-seine, and longline...|$|R
40|$|Althought few {{data are}} available, Indian Ocean tuna {{resources}} are becoming {{the object of}} an increasingly active fishery. Between 1980 and 1985 catches grew from 275 000 t to almost 450 000 t, a 60 % increase. Catches of tropical surface tuna species, mainly skipjack and yellowfin, nearly doubled during the same period, from 156 000 t to almost 300 000 t. The catch potential for these species is still largely unknow. This document summarizes present knowledge on the biology of the main species of tuna in the Indian Ocean, the oceanographic environment and its influence on production. The main artisanal fisheries are described country by country. Results of the many surveys carried out by <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>fishing,</b> with live bait, and purse seining or through aerial survey are analysed. These observations {{and the most recent}} results of commercial purse-seine fisheries give clear indications of those areas favourable to tuna surface concentration and consequently potential grounds for purse-seining and <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>fishing.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|It is a {{recognized}} {{fact that the}} availability of bait fish in sufficient quantities {{is one of the}} most important deciding factors in the successful operation of <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>fishing</b> for tuna. In the Indian Union tuna fishing on an organized scale exists only in the island of Minicoy in the Laccadive Archipelago.

40|$|The Union Territory of Lakshadweep is {{represented}} by twenty islands out of which only ten are inhabited. Oceanic species of tunas such as skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) are available in Lakshadweep area from October to May every year. They are being exploited from Minicoy waters by pole-and-line tuna fishing using live bait. Since 1960, <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>fishing</b> has been adopted in the other islands of Amini group {{with the introduction of}} mechanised boats. The seventies has seen an almost complete transition of replacement of the ' Odum' (traditional tuna fishing boats) with mechanised boats fitted with bait tanks at Minicoy Islands. Thus tuna fishing became popular in the Union Territory which is now fetching a good amount to the islanders and helping in the improvement of the economy of these islands...|$|E
40|$|Tuna purse seining in the Pacific Islands {{region is}} the world's largest tuna fishery. Currently some {{organizations}} are publicising {{the desirability of}} replacing {{at least some of}} the purse seining with <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>fishing</b> [...] a technique which requires significant quantities of live baitfish. This research was undertaken to determine the quantity of baitfish required to replace purse seining. It is estimated that to catch a million tonnes of tuna annually in the Pacific Islands region (i. e. replace the purse seine fishery) would require about 31, 250  t of baitfish per year. Historical catches of baitfish suggest that catches this large may not be possible. There is also some question of the practicality and desirability of a substantial increase in baitfish harvesting in the region. Tuna Purse seine Pole-and-line Baitfish...|$|E
40|$|A brief {{account is}} given {{of the early}} {{development}} of the Indonesian skipjack fishery. The skipjack industry in Indonesia {{has the potential to}} expand tremendously, especially since the skipjack stock is underutilised and there Is an increasing demand for the raw material in world markets. A review of the methods of fishing for skipjack indicated that the pole-and-line method appears to be the best means for harvesting this resource in Indonesian waters. However, problems relating to the availability, abundance,and hardiness of baitfish must be overcome before the fishery can be expanded to its maximum. Experimental <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>fishing</b> trials and surveys carried out on modern skipjack vessels have indicated a bright prospect {{for the development of a}} skipjack fishery, particularly in the eastern park of the Indonesian waters. The total landings of tuna and tuna-like fish from the Indonesian waters is estimated at around 30, 000 tons annually. Classified according to the conditions of the Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a wide}} {{geographical}} {{spread of}} skipjack <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>fishing</b> bases in east Indonesia. The article identifies and analyses {{the relative importance of}} several interactive factors on pole-and-line vessel catch performance, including the effects of the vessel (eg its size, horse power and age), baitfish (its availability and abundance), the crew (number and skill), season, weather, use of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), geographical location of the fishing ground, and 'fleet congestion'. The importance of FADs in improving catch performance is particularly highlighted. Partly from this comparative analysis, it is postulated that the resident stock in this area is supplemented by large seasonal migrations of skipjack from the western tropical Pacific stock. As the bulk of this migration passes through the waters north of Irian Jaya, this region must offer some of the best fishing opportunities, and hence will have the highest priority for the future development of skipjack pole-and-line and purse seine bases in Indonesia. ...|$|E
40|$|Scattered chum bait is very {{available}} in line fishing, {{and it has}} been defined as the bait to be scattered at the fishing spot to attract the fishes from far to come close to the spot. And up to now only the attracting effect of this bait has been discussed by many fisheries biologists. But the significant effectiveness of the scattered chum bait in line fishing can not be considered to depend only on the attracting factor. The author carried out the tank experiments on the reaction of fish to the extract of food to find out how the scattered chum bait allures fish to the fishing bait sewed to a hook. The results are summarized as follows: 1. The fishes used, spotted mackerel, perch and sweep lips, showed avoiding reaction to the colored sea water introduced into the experimental tank. On the otherhand, when these fishes were exposed to the extract of food, their swimming became very active, and they disrupted the schooling, showing a feeding frenzy. 2. The clear social facilitation was observed in the reaction of spotted mackerel to the extract of food, i. e. the respons of a group of 5 individuals was most active than the other groups of less individuals, when an individual was kept solitary in a tank there was no positive reaction to the extract of food. 3. When in a feeding frenzy these three fishes indiscriminately tried to take any small inedible objects in the water or at the water surface. 4. Furthermore when the sweep lips was exposed to the extract of food, it actively picked the bottom board of the tank even though there was no object on the board. This remarkable behavior was also observed in other bottom fishes in an aquarium. And so the reaction of fish to an extract of food is considered to have close relationship with its feeding habit. 5. From these observations it is concluded that the scattered chum bait evokes very active feeding behavior of fishes; an reaction of an individual enhances that of the schooling companions; the success of line fishing and <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>fishing</b> depends on this activity. When in such a state fishes indiscriminately take any small object in the water and thus are vulnerable to line fishing and <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>fishing.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Problems {{have arisen}} not only between Japan and China but also between Japan and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands. Under these circumstances, there are {{fishermen}} operating around the Senkaku Islands. In this paper, putting {{a focus on}} <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>fishing</b> boats for groundfish that belong to the Hinoshima Fishermen's Cooperative in Kumamoto Prefecture and the Ibusuki Fishermen's Cooperative in Kagoshima Prefecture, this paper discusses the utilization of fishing grounds and the forms of operation, clarifies the relationship between Chinese fishing boats and Chinese government vessels, and analyzes the problems these Japanese fishermen face in operations and management. The results of the analysis are as follows. (1) The deployment of Chinese government vessels makes it almost impossible for ships of less than 5 tons from Okinawa Prefecture to operate. (2) Therefore, there is currently no competition between the fishing boats of Kyushu and Okinawa in the fishing grounds of the Senkaku Islands. (3) Chinese government vessels are deployed mainly in the waters surrounding Uotsuri Island and utilization of the Senkaku fishing grounds tends to concentrate in the territorial seas of Taisho Island. As {{a result of the}} deteriorating functioning of the Japan-China fishery pact and the conclusion of the Japan-Taiwan fishery pact, confusion in Japanese fishing operations is growing more serious...|$|E
40|$|A NEW DISTRIBUTION RECORD for a long-corseletted frigate {{mackerel}} {{of the genus}} Auxis was established on November 30, 1957, with the capture of 21 specimens in the centr al Pacific Ocean. These fish {{were taken from the}} same school together with five short-corseletted {{frigate mackerel}}s. The catch was made from the re-search vessel "John R. Manning " of the Pacific Oceanic Fishery Investigations (POFI), by <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>fishing,</b> one mile offshore, two miles northwest of Cape Kaea, lanai. Although the long- and short-corselerred Auxis are known {{from both sides of the}} Pacific, only the short-corseletted form has been reported heretofore from the central Pacific area. As is the case with some of the other scom-brids, the taxonomy of this genus is not very clear. Although the identity of the short-corseletted form has been well established as A. thazard (Lacepede 1802), the nomenclature of the long-corseletted form has been confused because of incomplete description and subse-quent misnaming by other workers. It is hoped that this paper will help to clarify the nomen-clature of this genus. The long-corseletted form of the western Pacific has been identified by various names. Kishinouye (1915 : 13 - 14) recognized two spe-cies of Auxis in Japanese waters, to which he ascribed the names A. hira and A. maru. The former species was described as having a short corselet which ended slightly posterior to the pectoral fin, whereas the latter was described as having a long corselet which extended to the anal fin. Under the description of the lat-ter species, Kishinouye stated that "Bleeker's tapeinosoma may also be this species, but the figure and description of this species are very rough and unclear.
