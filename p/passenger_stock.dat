5|$|The Talyllyn Railway {{remains a}} {{successful}} and popular tourist attraction. The original 1860s locomotives and <b>passenger</b> <b>stock</b> still run regularly alongside {{the roster of}} more modern rolling stock. The railway is promoted as one of The Great Little Trains of Wales, a joint marketing scheme launched in 1970 that encompasses ten narrow gauge railways in the country, mostly found in north and mid Wales.|$|E
5|$|The 1920s {{also saw}} an upsurge in holiday traffic, as Britain {{recovered}} from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal <b>passenger</b> <b>stock</b> with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats. An unusual tourist service offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which would be left at Abergynolwyn. At {{the end of the}} day the tourists would return to Tywyn in the wagon, powered by gravity. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s. The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some of the costs of operating the railway, but never enough for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones' ownership.|$|E
5|$|From {{the opening}} of the line, <b>passenger</b> <b>stock</b> {{consisted}} of 4-wheel carriages. In 1845, there were eight passenger trains a day from Tunbridge Wells to London, with half that number on Sundays. On 23June 1849, the Royal Train took Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to Tunbridge Wells to visit Queen Adelaide, the Queen Dowager. The train, consisting of the Royal Saloon, two first class carriages and a brake van made the journey from Bricklayers Arms to Tunbridge Wells in 75 minutes. It was driven by James Cudworth, the Locomotive Superintendent of the SER. The return journey took 70 minutes. The Royal Train visited the line again on 18December 1849 conveying Queen Victoria and Princess Alice from Windsor, Berkshire to Tunbridge Wells on a visit to Princess Louise. The journey via Waterloo took 100 minutes. The train was driven by William Jacomb, Resident Engineer of the LSWR, and Edgar Verringer, Superintendent of the LSWR. At Waterloo, driving of the train was taken over by John Shaw, General Manager of the SER and Mr. Cockburn, Superintendent of the SER. The return journey took 105 minutes.|$|E

5|$|While single {{passenger}} cars were sometimes {{moved around the}} system, either between depots or to Acton Works, these movements were infrequent, {{and when they were}} necessary, standard stock motor cars borrowed from the passenger fleet were normally used. Following the introduction of the 1959 <b>passenger</b> <b>stock,</b> single cars and parts of units were moved around much more frequently, and normal passenger motor cars could not be used to perform this task, as the equipment they needed to operate was spread around the unit, rather than confined to the motor car. Eight Standard Stock motor cars, dating from 1927 and 1934, were therefore allocated as pilot motor cars. In 1967, they were painted maroon, numbered L130 to L137, and became part of the ballast motor fleet. Four were withdrawn in 1971 without performing this work, however. Following withdrawal, L137 was shipped to the Isle of Wight, to replace a car on the Island Line which had been damaged. The remaining four cars worked as two pairs, and were still working as pilot motor cars in 1987, but had been withdrawn by 1993.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as running}} stock the railway {{also has a}} large {{collection}} of heritage rolling stock. <b>Passenger</b> <b>stock</b> {{is made up of}} three uniform rakes of British Rail Mark 1 coaches originally built in the 1950s and 60s. They are in Maroon, Carmine and Cream, and Southern Green liveries. BR Western Region Chocolate and Cream livered Mark 1 coaches will gradually enter service during 2014.|$|E
25|$|Another {{solution}} to loss of brake pressure is the two-pipe system, fitted on most modern <b>passenger</b> <b>stock</b> and many freight wagons. In {{addition to the}} traditional brake pipe, this enhancement adds the main reservoir pipe, which is continuously charged with air directly from the locomotive's main reservoir. The main reservoir is where the locomotive's air compressor output is stored, and is ultimately the source of compressed air for all systems that use it.|$|E

25|$|In 1948 {{there was}} a chronic {{shortage}} of large passenger tank locomotives on the un-electrified lines of the former London Brighton and South Coast Railway. As a result, trials of the class were made with <b>passenger</b> <b>stock</b> between Victoria railway station and Tunbridge Wells West railway station via the Oxted Line. However, like the K & K1 classes the W class {{were found to be}} unstable at speed and were banned from use on passenger trains.|$|E
25|$|Steam and vacuum brakes, {{as well as}} {{steam heating}} were provided. This was to enable the {{locomotive}} to undertake the shunting of <b>passenger</b> <b>stock</b> should such a role be called for. A second batch of ten locomotives was planned to be constructed at Eastleigh, but the economic climate in 1931 meant that the order was scrapped. By the time trade recovered in the mid 1930s, Maunsell had begun experimenting {{in the use of}} diesel-electric shunting locomotives for these duties, and no further examples were built.|$|E
25|$|Both the South Eastern and London, Chatham and Dover Railway companies' {{locomotives}} {{were painted}} black each {{with their own}} style of lining but, when {{taken over by the}} South Eastern and Chatham Railways Managing Committee (SE), dark green was adopted with an elaborate lining scheme. After some trials with a hybrid colour scheme (SER maroon on the upper parts and LC teak on the lower), the SE adopted the dark maroon/lake livery for <b>passenger</b> <b>stock.</b> Ex-LC locomotives were renumbered by adding 459 to the running numbers (i.e. locomotive No 1 became No 460, etc.); SER locomotives retained their existing numbers.|$|E

25|$|During the 1960s a {{new house}} was {{constructed}} within {{the grounds of the}} railway, {{and at the same time}} the ornamental lake was drained and in-filled. This rendered the impressive bridge redundant, and brought an end to the scene of trains running over the lake, but following the dismantling of the bridge the track was relayed across the newly drained lake. At the same time Tanners Halt station was closed. During the early 1970s the steam locomotives were replaced with electric engines, and newer coaches were added to the <b>passenger</b> <b>stock.</b> There was no overlap of steam and electric operations, although the steam locomotive Maid of Kent remained in the engine shed into the start of the electric operations.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 four pre-series sets (each {{consisting}} of a motor car and a driving trailer) were delivered. Ordered in 1981, they originally bore the RBDe 4/4 designation and road numbers 2100-2103. All four trainsets (RBDe 560 + Bt) were delivered in different color schemes, {{one of which was}} the livery used for the main series (blue over white sides, yellow doors, and red faces). The striking contrast to the green color scheme of previous SBB <b>passenger</b> <b>stock</b> led to the name Kolibri (Hummingbird), which is, however, rarely used. Nearly all the RBDe 560 sets have been named after smaller municipalities along the lines served by these trainset received the appropriate coat of arms.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} aspects of the L was its rolling stock, with the locomotives appearing originally in a livery of plain lined Holly green, later on a black base, with chestnut under-frames, hauling passenger carriages coloured terracotta with off-white upper panels, and light grey goods wagons. [...] The schemes were simplified as individual vehicles were repainted. [...] With the take over by the Southern and arrival of Lew the livery was slowly changed to Maunsell Green for locos and <b>passenger</b> <b>stock,</b> and umber for the goods wagons. The loco headlamps which had been black under the L were re-painted red.|$|E

2500|$|Two logos (or crests) {{were used}} during the period.

The second logo (1956–1965) featured a lion holding a wheel (which {{gave rise to the}} nickname [...] "ferret and dartboard"), sitting in a crown, with the words [...] "British" [...] and [...] "Railways" [...] to left and right. (<b>Passenger</b> <b>stock</b> and certain diesel locomotives used a roundel variant, where the words [...] "British Railways" [...] were in a ring surrounding the crest.) From 1965, the BR Corporate Image and [...] "Double Arrow" [...] logo was adopted, but this logo was not applied to steam locomotives (except on the Vale of Rheidol line).|$|E

2500|$|Electrification {{brought the}} {{introduction}} of the legendary and locally-built Class 303 EMUs, operated from a new depot at the former Hyndland terminus station. From 1967 they were joined by the similar Class 311 EMUs, which were built for the Inverclyde Line electrification but which were initially allocated to Hyndland for maintenance and were occasionally used on the North Clyde Line. The Class 303 and 311 trains were nicknamed the [...] "Blue Trains" [...] because of the bright Caledonian Blue colour scheme they carried in the 1960s, {{at a time when most}} British Railways <b>passenger</b> <b>stock</b> was painted either green or maroon. In the late 1960s they began to be repainted in the new standard Rail Blue, and from the late 1970s they received coaching stock blue/grey livery. This was followed by the distinctive Strathclyde PTE orange-and-black scheme in the 1980s. A few of the last surviving Class 303s eventually received the new SPT carmine/cream livery in the late 1990s. In September 2008 Transport Scotland announced that the SPT carmine and cream livery would be discontinued; trains will start to be repainted in a new, blue livery with white Saltire motifs at the ends of each carriage.|$|E
2500|$|The Silver Star was {{a luxury}} {{passenger}} train that ran overnight between Auckland and Wellington on the North Island Main Trunk railway of New Zealand. The train ran from Monday, 6 September 1971 until Sunday, 8 June 1979. [...] It replaced the Night Limited express passenger trains, which provided a faster service than the [...] "Ordinary" [...] Expresses by stopping at only six intermediate stations en route and not dragging postal or parcels vans at the rear. Designed as a [...] "hotel on wheels", its carriages were distinctive in New Zealand; {{rather than being}} painted in the traditional red, the Silver Stars carriages were made of stainless steel, and silver in appearance. Original planning of the train envisaged the sleeping cars being the basis of new standard NZR <b>passenger</b> <b>stock</b> with future passenger trains of 6 carriages and van, 7 stainless steel units of 30 tons each (210) tons pulled by a 1425hp DA. However planning for the Limited replacement became more ambitious in the early 1960s, moving away from 25 ton, 55ft stainless carriages of the type used on the 3ft 6inch, QR Sunlander to sleeping cars of standard gauge 9ft 9inch, standard gauge loading gauge. As a result the usual Silver star consist of 35 ton carriages would weigh 410 tons and lead to the order for superpower DX locomotive of 2750hp from General Electric to pull them and express freight on the NIMT and result in a large trackside work on the NIMT and the Silver stars alternative route via Marton- Wanganu-Stratford - Taurmaranui, to accommodate standard gauge width [...] carriages running on 3ft 6 inch.|$|E
