40|$|Degradation of Kraft lignin {{by using}} hemin and {{hydrogen}} peroxide was investigated to produce phenolic compounds. The degradation products were identified using spectroscopic methods and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). 2 -Methoxyphenol, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, and vanillic acid were produced. Their polymerisation products {{were used as}} synthetic tanning agents for tanning collagen. Polymerised 2 -methoxyphenol can increase the hydrothermal stability of collagen, like a conventional syntan, through hydrogen bonding interactions between the polymers and the protein. These products have potential {{to be used as}} raw materials for tanning of animal skins and other industries, such as chemical, pharmaceutical, food, and perfumery industries. Therefore, this can add value to the industrial byproduct (Kraft lignin), often considered a waste, and reduce its environmental impact. Leather tanning reactions between collagen and dihydroxynaphthalenes (DHNs) and oxazolidine have also been investigated, using hide powder and sheepskin <b>pickled</b> <b>pelt.</b> This investigation showed that some DHNs have a tanning effect on collagen. The measurement of combined and cross-linked DHNs on collagen showed that 30 – 40 % of 1, 6 - and 2, 6 -DHNs were fixed through covalent bonding. Shrinkage temperature of the leather changed little after the non combined DHNs had been removed from the leather, indicating that the high stability of the combination tanned leather comes from the covalent bonding formed between DHNs and collagen through oxazolidine. This work indicates that Kraft lignin degradation products could be used as new and innovative agents for leather production in a way that opens up new markets and reduces environmental pollution...|$|E
40|$|Chrome tanning is a {{versatile}} tanning system, but the pollution problems of chromium due to inadequa-cy of treatment systems and possible formation of Cr(VI), a carcinogen, {{have led to}} search for an eco-friendly and viable alternative tanning system. The present investigation focuses {{on the development of}} a novel, high performance and thermally stable aldehyde tannage system to produce chrome free leather by cross linking the NH 2 groups of collagen with glutaraldehyde (CHO-CH 2 -CH 2 -CH 2 -CHO). After as usual soaking, liming, deliming, bating and pickling operations the <b>pickle</b> <b>pelts</b> were tanned with glu-taraldehyde and other syntans.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was concerned with}} the concentration of residual chromium tanning liquor by evaporative techniques and the re-use of this concentrated chromium liquor for tannage after adjustment with a makeup of basic chromium sulphate powder. Twelve samples of the residual chromium liquors were collected randomly from ALNASR and the White Nile Tanneries. They were analysed mainly for Cr 2 o 3 content, concentration of neutral salts (0 Be) and (PH). The average quantity of chromium oxide "Cr 2 o 3 " for both tanneries which discharged as waste to the drain {{was found to be}} 5. 58 g/L. This quantity is equivalent to 32 % of the chromic oxide added {{at the beginning of the}} tannage. This mean, that more or less one third of the basic chromium sulphate used in tannage is lost as waste. Then two Evaporation experiments were carried out at the White Nile Tannery laboratory by direct heating to determine the optimum evaporation level for maximum chromium oxide recovery. This level of evaporation was found to be about 27 % of the water, can be evaporated without much loss of chromium oxide. Then Eight tanning Experiments were carried out at the White Nile Tannery pilot plant in the following manner:- A residual chrome liquor (R 1) was taken from the White Nile tannery and it was evaporated to the required level (C 1). Then the chromium oxide in (C 1) was determined and was adjusted with fresh chromium powder to maintain the tanning percentage to 7 %. Then it was used to tan a delimed, bated, <b>pickled</b> <b>pelt.</b> The residual liquor(R 2) from (C 1) was again evaporated to (C 2). Then the chromium oxide in (C 2) was determined and adjusted to the required level with fresh chromium powder. Then it was used to tan a delimed, bated, <b>pickled</b> <b>pelt.</b> This process was repeated eight times untill (C 8) and (R 9). The average quantity of basic chromium sulphate required to be added as a make-up was found to be 4. 9 %. That means 2. 1 % of basic chromium sulphate is saved all through the year, in addition to the following savings:- 1) 4 % in the sodium chloride 2) 60 - 70 % in the water 3) 0. 1 - 0. 2 % in the sulphuric Acid Then four pelts tanned with (C 8), (C 7), (C 6) plus one side from the White Nile Tannery were retanned as usual and they were paste- Dried. Then they were tested for their physical and chemical properties and the results obtained were found to be within the accepted international limits. The economical evaluation of the project was found to be feasible. The annual profit was found to be 33767 US$ and the pay-back period was found to be about 1. 3 year. As with regard to the environmental evaluation and since the process is a closed loop process, then appendix (5) proves that the salinity will be reduced by 25 %, the toxicity by 24 %, the B. O. D by 1. 2 % and the C. O. D by 1 %, from the total pollution load of the tannery. Hence this process is an eco-friendly process, in addition to the reduction in cost of the end of pipe treatment...|$|E

Kraft lignin degradation by a biomimetic system was investigated, using haemin and hydrogen peroxide, which mimics the catalytic mechanism of lignin peroxidase to produce phenolic compounds. The degradation products were identified using spectroscopic methods and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 2 -methoxyphenol, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin and vanillic acid were produced and their formaldehyde polymerisation products were used for tanning collagen. The denaturation (shrinkage) temperature of collagen was raised to 80 °C through hydrogen bonding interactions between the polymers and the protein. For dyeing of hide powder, the lignin degradation products were reacted with laccase (a polyphenol oxidase); 2 -methoxyphenol gave the darkest colour. These products have potential to be used as raw materials for tanning and dyeing of animal skins. Therefore, this can add value to the industrial byproduct (Kraft lignin) and reduce its environmental impact. Polyphenols are the basic building blocks of natural skin and hair pigments: they can be polymerised to create versions of natural black, brown and orange melanins. These reactions can be catalysed by laccase; not only do they create colour, but also if they are conducted in the presence of collagen, the resulting pigment is bound to the leather in a covalent tanning manner. Therefore, the leather becomes coloured by a lightfast pigment, which is firmly fixed. It appears to be a feature of this type of stabilising mechanism for collagen, the creation of a polyphenol matrix around the triple helix, that it has the added benefit of actually strengthening the leather. Since every traditional process step effectively weakens collagen, especially tanning, this is the first chemical reaction that has been shown to reverse that effect. Leather tanning reactions between collagen and dihydroxynaphthalenes (DHNs) and oxazolidine have been investigated, using hide powder and sheepskin <b>pickled</b> <b>pelt.</b> This investigation showed that some DHNs have a tanning effect on collagen. The measurement of combined and cross-linked DHNs on collagen showed that 30 - 40...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an overview and describes progress on work directed ultimately at developing an automated grading system for <b>pickled</b> sheep <b>pelts.</b> A laser scanner {{has been developed}} which provides simultaneous acquisition of three image types representing transmission, reflectance and fluorescent properties of the pelts. Of particular interest is the fluorescence image which highlights pelt defects not normally apparent with either the naked eye or a camera. The variation of pelt fluorescence with time has been investigated and two mechanisms identified—one due to long term decay of the fluorescent yield from time of slaughter and the other due to rapid decay of fluorescence with time {{of exposure to the}} laser excitation. The feasibility of using light transmission as a measure of pelt thickness has been investigated and preliminary results suggest that this will not be possible without other information also being used. Pattern recognition algorithms which show potential for automating the grading process are currently under investigation. These are briefly introduced. 1...|$|R
