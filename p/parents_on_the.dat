5|$|Although {{women were}} on a lower social tier than men (according to Confucian ethics), they enjoyed many social and legal {{privileges}} and wielded considerable power {{at home and in}} their own small businesses. As Song society became more and more prosperous and <b>parents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bride's side of the family provided larger dowries for her marriage, women naturally gained many new legal rights in ownership of property. Under certain circumstances, an unmarried daughter without brothers, or a surviving mother without sons, could inherit one-half of her father's share of undivided family property. There were many notable and well-educated women, and it was a common practice for women to educate their sons during their earliest youth. The mother of the scientist, general, diplomat, and statesman Shen Kuo taught him essentials of military strategy. There were also exceptional women writers and poets, such as Li Qingzhao (1084–1151), who became famous even in her lifetime.|$|E

Jean-Marie was the brother of Paul Jetté, Cadron's uncle by marriage, {{and at the time}} the two met he was in his thirties. After the wedding, Rosalie Cadron took her husband's name and was known as Rosalie Cadron-Jetté. Jean-Marie moved into Cadron-Jetté's parents' house with her, and undertook a new career as a farmer. In 1811, that house, along with the surrounding land and outbuildings, was donated to Cadron-Jetté and Jean-Marie by Cadron-Jetté's <b>parents,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> condition that the parents be allowed to live there until their death, and that Cadron-Jetté and Jean-Marie assume the care of Cadron-Jetté's sister Sophie until her age of majority.|$|E

As per the Mula Gosain Charita, he was born under the Abhuktamūla constellation, which according to Jyotisha (Hindu astrology) causes immediate danger to the life of the father. Due to the inauspicious events at the time of his birth, he was abandoned by his <b>parents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fourth night, sent away with Chuniya (some sources call her Muniya), a female servant of Hulsi.

5|$|Headley resumed {{playing for}} Lucas {{on his return}} to Jamaica, {{attracting}} great crowds and high expectations. Once the cricket season ended, he embarked on another trip to America to play exhibition matches, visiting his <b>parents</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> journey. On his return for the 1931–32 season, he was appointed captain of Lucas and began preparing for the forthcoming tour of Jamaica by another team led by Lord Tennyson. In addition to his regular practice, Headley began a programme of running and swimming to improve his overall fitness. After performing well in the trial matches for Jamaica, he was selected in the first match against the tourists. Jamaica made an uncertain start, losing five wickets by the time their score reached 215 but Headley had scored 130. He then shared a partnership of 487 for the sixth wicket with Clarence Passailaigue; 236 not out after the first day's play, Headley went on to score an unbeaten 344, after batting for 407 minutes and hitting 39 fours. Jamaica totalled 702, and won the match by an innings. During his innings, Headley passed the previous highest score by any West Indian batsman, 304 not out by Percy Tarilton in 1920, and {{the highest score in}} the West Indies by any batsman, Andy Sandham's 325 in 1930. His partnership with Passailaigue took 248 minutes, and as of 2015 remains a world record for the highest sixth wicket partnership in a first-class match. The success of two home batsmen led to celebrations in Jamaica and praise from the English bowlers for Headley's batting. Headley continued his success in the second game, opening the batting and top-scoring with 84 in the first innings. In the second innings, opening again, he made 155 not out to guide West Indies to their victory target of 363. In the final match, Headley scored his third century of the series after returning to number three, accumulating 140 of Jamaica's total of 561. Jamaica won the match to win the series 3–0; Headley scored 723 runs at an average of 361.50. In the remainder of the season, Headley led Lucas to victory in the Senior Cup, scoring a century in the final.|$|E
