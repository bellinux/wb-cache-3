40|$|A recent {{trend in}} the Malaysian retail {{industry}} is the growing Malaysian Muslim consumers’ conservatism, {{and the need to}} adopt to the Islamic way of life.

40|$|In 1474, Francesco Filelfo (1398 - 1481) wrote several long, still {{unedited}} essay {{letters to}} prominent European political leaders, calling (not {{for the first}} time in his career) for a crusade against the malignant Turks who had seized his beloved Constantinople and who were threatening to invade other parts of Europe. In my paper, I will explore how the theme of the ideal prince’s moral and Christian duties and the rhetoric of patronage run through these letters to Duke Charles of Burgundy, Duke Federico da Montefeltro, Pope Sixtus IV and King Ferrante of Naples. I will take into account the classical and historical exempla that the letters have in common, while pointing also to the differences that distinguish them from each other, and examine their relationship to earlier calls for a crusade by Filelfo and to other letters written to the same recipients. An analysis of the literary and rhetorical techniques of these letters as well as the role played by <b>patronage</b> <b>motives</b> may indeed provide a necessary but complementary vision to an exclusively ‘historicizing’ reading of these elaborate texts. status: publishe...|$|R

Unfortunately, the explosion of articles studying internet patronage involve the same limitation as previous shopping motivation research. Namely, the internet {{is just one of many}} channels from which consumers 2 ̆ 7 can choose to purchase products. Current articles on internet patronage, as well as the previous work on other channels, have failed to account for this fact. These studies examine <b>patronage</b> <b>motives</b> one channel at a time, while neglecting to account for how consumers choose between channels. As such, the main goal of this study was to develop an integrative consumer channel preference model which would allow for a comparison across channels to determine which factors are the most influential for each channel. ^ Participants for this study consisted of individuals 16 and older who had access to the internet. This sample was chosen to ensure that consumers have some type of access to the internet, which is essential for any on-line purchases.
