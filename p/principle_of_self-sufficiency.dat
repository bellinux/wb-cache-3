The aim of my project is to demonstrate that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> is foundational to the understanding of both Aristotle's political economy and political agrarianism, and thus they ought be seen as compatible in their outlook on economic activity. I begin with an interpretation of Aristotle's political economy and argue that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> is central to any adequate interpretation of it. In addition, I discuss how in the secondary literature a quarrel between agrarian republics and commercial ones has surfaced in regard to the understanding of his political economy. I claim that Aristotle is neither an agrarian nor does he favor commerce over the agrarian way of life, but rather he is better perceived as a moderate friend of political agrarianism, as he seems to prefer agrarianism over the merchant's commercial way of life. Given that the common opinion of the virtuous, self-sufficient farmer originated in ancient Greece, I also demonstrate the genesis and basis of this opinion in the work of Hesiod, Aristophanes, and Xenophon. In the second part of my dissertation, I focus on how the English and American agrarian social critics of the twentieth century have invoked the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> in response to industrial capitalism and the global economy. My intent is to show how this principle shapes their outlook regarding economic activity and is foundational to their way of life. My task is not to argue that agrarianism is better than commercialism, but rather I simply want to demonstrate how and when the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> is invoked among agrarians, as this principle makes their political economy compatible with Aristotle's. And it is principally among the Catholic English Distributists (G. K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, and Father Vincent McNabb) and the American agrarians (Wendell Berry and Victor Davis Hanson) that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> is invoked regarding political and economic matters...|$|E

40|$|Despite a trend {{during the}} last century towards a {{disconnection}} between agriculture and forestry, small woodlots strongly associated to farming activities are still very common in south western France. To explain {{the origin of this}} particularity and its consequences, we engaged ethnological, biotechnical and ecological studies. The ethnological study showed that the ‘house-centred’ social system - which is characteristic in this region - has shaped landscapes and reinforced the need for scattered small woodlots. Due to a <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency,</b> each farm had to have a direct access on its property or in its vicinity to all the resources needed. Woodlots had been maintained on lands that might have been cultivated and they contain a large diversity of woody species - even in the dominant tree layer - corresponding to the species needed for the family uses. Even if they are less able to apply all the usual practices, small woodlots are still seen by farmers as important components of their resources and landscapes. Their management lead to a particularly fine-grained mosaic of stands with different historical trajectories. Ecological studies revealed that these woodlots, and especially their edges, are key components of processes impacting agricultural activities, such as pest regulation. We argue that the small woodlots maintained in rural landscapes in south western France are beneficial for agriculture, forestry and rural activities, especially in a global change perspective. The question is how to keep their characteristics when their managers are leaving {{because of the lack of}} support from policy makers...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the nature and function of institutional confinement in late Victorian society. It consists of an analysis of incarceration at the local level, focusing on the county asylum and prison of Warwickshire, based on case-history and administrative records. The first chapter sets prison and asylum detention within the broader pattern of confinement in Warwickshire, discussing whether a cohesive systemI of incarceration existed. Next is examined the key role played by county magistrates in the provision of public and private institutions and their reluctance to follow national policy to the letter. A study of inmate labour demonstrates that the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> allowed local authorities to economise, with a mitigating influence on the ideologies of 'moral treatment' and penitentiary punishment. The remaining chapters concern the inmates. Workhouse, prison and asylum entrants are compared with the source population of the County. Social isolation was a factor common to entrants to all three institutions, but asylum inmates included many who were far from destitute. The last two chapters extend the theme that asylums were not functioning as places for Victorian society to offload its deviant and 'marginal' members. Study of the mentally disordered offender and the mentally handicapped indicates that opposition to the extension of segregative control persisted both locally and nationally. In conclusion it is argued that late Victorian institutions were less efficient at quarantining the deviant from the rest of society than previous studies have suggested. The conclusion also points out, however, that the fear of incarceration remained an important theme in the poor's relationship with the State, to which the experiences of institution inmates contributed. Further research into the role played by incarceration in this world-view, might avoid the pitfalls of an over-emphasis on 'social control', while acknowledging the inmate perspective...|$|E
40|$|Farmtecture” is a {{neologism}} of synthesis, {{devised by}} the authors to represent {{a new model of}} study to describe several particular applications in architecture. It is created to give body to a new concept of structural design for the construction of environments, also adapted to extreme weather conditions, designed expressly to accommodate the integrated agricultural production of quality in urban area. The Farmtecture, according to the AA, represent a possible answer to improve the safety and sustainability of food production, using and enhancing the environmental and human resources available in the urban environment. After analyzing the effects due to an increase in population and the direct impact on food security and food availability in the next 10 - 15 years, the Authors propose to realize in the large urban areas this new type of structures Farmtecture that can accommodate an integrated farming systems. In synthesis the Farmtecture buildings, depending of the environments they occupy and the structural rules in which they are made, can be different (Vertical Farm, Floating Farm, Underground Farm, Underwater Farm, Space Farm etc.) and are designed in according to the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> energy, using the scientific knowledge and the best technologies developed in recent years. The management of the Farmtecture with its integrated production systems planning and organization is based on mathematics - informatics methods of matrix calculation and linear programming, made possible by the use of powerful computers and by the cybernetic current knowledge. The management goals are accorrdingly set to the objectives of equifinality, maximum profit. food security, minimum water footprint, minimum carbon footprint / maximum level of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), optimization of the LCA procedure and maximum sustainability of the productions. The Authors describe an application model for the design of a Vertical Farm (VF), giving body to the General Theory of Systems Integrated, entrusting the automated management of the VF to complex mathematical models and an articulated system of monitoring and control of the environmental parameters. The techniques of aquaculture and organic farming are balanced and operated simultaneously, in order to achieve a symbiosis and synergy complementary, in which plant and animal production systems are integrated and feed eachother with reciprocity, in the context of VF. In particular, the work suggests productive associations compatible/ possible, depending on the particular and different climatic and geographical situations, including: sturgeons, tilapias, shrimps, carps, truffles, fruits, vegetables etc [...] , In particular for the “Floating Farm” (FF), are also provided the possible productive associations of marine organisms, managed and con-trolled in independent hydraulic circuits, with parallel productions of the freshwater systems. The Farmtecture is conceived as a space where different productive activities, including shops, restaurants, such as spas, conference centers and apartments, take place and help in integrating the all Farmtecture with all the values that optimize, according to authors holistic view, the viability and sustainability of the production structural complex itself. The study plans to incorporate the Farmtecture type VF, in different urban contexts to retrieve brownfield of industrial sites of all kinds, in order to solve different problems and risks common to many urban areas and territories all over the world. All Farmtecture Types are efficient and sustainable and above all are our meaning for a new forma urbis compatible with a more human dimension. Too many cities all over the world have lost the human dimension delicate balance and simply produce urban decay, social turmoils and even violence. This work is a study on the possibilities offered by this new interpretation of the sustainable use of production space, offering a real perspective to improving the safety and quality of strictly organic food, combining advanced science and food traditions. The Authors claim is that the future passes through a recovery of the human dimension and a correct land use, placing the forma urbis at the center of decisions, through a de-structuring and re-engineering of the urban production, using as a variable, the platform of new scientific knowledge and qualitative parameters for innovative choices: LCA, water footprint, carbon footprint and Social footprint, are the new design parameters of the Farmtecture Sus-tainable food production, made in certified environments within the cities borders, combining the most up dated and innovative technolgies with the ancient tradition of food excellence, is the new frontier and a big change in our urban society model and our constant pursuit of happiness...|$|E

This situation is contrary to the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> and proximity governing correct waste management and leads to excessive transport costs, in both economic and environmental terms.

In this study a Geographical Information System is used, together with indicators of the carbon footprint and the ecological footprint, to assess the environmental impact of transporting MSW in the province of Castellon. The footprint of transporting MSW is thus assessed in both the current scenario and the future scenario, that is, once the planned treatment facilities become operational.

40|$|The {{notion of}} "khozraschet" {{appeared}} in Soviet {{economy in the}} period of far-reaching centralization. It meant then a combination of central management of the state enterprises with some degree of their freedom in the fulfilment of commitments to increase production and lower production cost. This method of management was always connected with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> enterprises. The notion of "khozraschet" appeared in Polish economy in 1950, {{in the period of}} adoption in this country of the Soviet business management and financial system. Since 1956 another meaning of "khozraschet" has become more popular. This term has been used to denote a limited scope of state enterprises freedom in choosing their own production and investment tasks on the basis of economic calculation, Actually the enterprises have not acquired such freedom in production decissions and their freedom in investment decisions has been limited to very small undertakings. In practice, "khozraschet" continues to be associated in most cases with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>self-sufficiency.</b> This <b>principle</b> is, however, supplemented with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> delimitation of the state enterprise funds from the state budget. Without this delimitation the state enterprises could not be independent in their production and investment decisions (even within a limited scope). The problem of fund delimitation of state enterprises becomes complicated when the enterprise makes use of the bank credit to complete its own funds. l i miting of bank credit and paying it back from the enterprises own funds confirms the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> delimitation of the state enterprises funds from the state budget, but this is the case only so far as the investment credit is concerned. Easy possibility of obtaining short-term credit for current production needs makes credit similar to budget subsidies.

The data are obtained from Eurostat and from {{national statistical offices}} of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. The rate <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> is evaluated for the time period 2003 - 2013 and its results are compared to trade coverage ratio that indicates competitiveness of country in given commodity. Degree <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> is an important indicator of country's ability to meet demand of domestic supply. From the obtained results, it can be concluded, that {{the situation in the}} Czech Republic with regard to self-sufficiency significantly deteriorated after EU accession, especially in the area of pork and poultry. The self-sufficiency for pork meat decreased to 57 % and to 73 % in the case of poultry. The situation is quite stable for beef. However beef creates {{only a small portion of}} the Czech consumption. A similar situation can be observed in Slovakia, its degree <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> pork and poultry declined down to 53 % and 78 % respectively. To cover production of poultry and pork from national resources in both countries, production would need to increase by millions of swine and chicken, which may be complicated with respect to existing infrastructure. The production of beef, poultry and pork is sufficient in Poland, production covers consumption. Self-sufficiency in beef increased above 400 % mainly due to decline in beef consumption. Since 2009, self-sufficiency in pork has slightly risen and in 2013 it reached 117 %. Consumption and production of poultry is on the rise, poultry become a substitute to beef; processing industry doubled its output between 2003 and 2013.
