25|$|The {{transport}} system uses the proof-of-payment approach for fare collection for the metro, local trains, trams and ferries. In the buses the driver checks the tickets as <b>passenger</b> <b>step</b> in. Ticket controllers check tickets on randomly selected vehicles and a penalty fee of 80 EUR and {{a price of}} a single ticket is charged from any passenger without a valid ticket. If a passenger has forgotten his/her Travel Card with valid travel period, the passenger may later visit a service point of the transport company and {{will not have to}} pay the penalty fee.|$|E

6000|$|When {{the steamer}} was thus, at length, moored to the landing, {{a number of}} the <b>passengers</b> <b>stepped</b> off, and a great many others got on; and, {{immediately}} afterwards, the cables were cast off, and the boy called out,---- ...|$|R
50|$|There {{originally}} was no bottom station, <b>passengers</b> <b>stepped</b> into the tramcars {{directly from the}} pavement as the control equipment was incorporated in the upper station and no station was provided {{at the bottom of}} the lift. Fares are paid at the top station.|$|R
25|$|On April 1, 2003, Habeeb was {{traveling}} by rail from Seattle, Washington, to Washington, DC, intending {{to begin a}} new job with an Arabic-language newspaper. He and other <b>passengers</b> <b>stepped</b> off the train {{to take a break}} during a 30-minute stop at Havre, Montana.|$|R
60|$|The train {{rolled into}} the station; <b>passengers</b> <b>stepped</b> in and out; doors slammed, and the guard had already placed the whistle in his mouth, when Captain Crippen, {{breathing}} stentorously, came stumbling blindly on to the platform, and was hustled into a third class carriage.|$|R
50|$|Finnpulp {{actually}} pulled alongside Yarmouth Castle on {{the port}} side, and <b>passengers</b> <b>stepped</b> from the burning ship onto {{the deck of the}} freighter. Finnpulp was quickly forced to retreat to a safe distance, however, when its paint began to smoke and burn. The freighter then dispatched its lifeboats to pluck people from the water.|$|R
50|$|The easternmost {{stretch of}} {{line has been}} {{incorporated}} into the Onny Trail, forming a walk {{along the banks of}} the River Onny and across the fields where <b>passengers</b> <b>stepped</b> down to pick mushrooms. The course of the line is clearly visible today, well demarcated and forms a broad grassy walkway through sheep pasture or woodland trackway.|$|R

25|$|After the {{cessation}} of aircraft manufacture and modification, Heston Aircraft switched to a support role within the aviation industry, trading as Hestair. In early 1952 they were supplying components to de Havilland, Vickers-Armstrong and D. Napier & Son. In late 1953, the company was building <b>passenger</b> <b>steps</b> for BOAC de Havilland Comets and Bristol Britannias, and mobile servicing docks for BEA's Heathrow engineering base.|$|R
5000|$|The origin is a taxi {{expression}} for the minimum charge for hiring a taxi, {{to which the}} rate per kilometre or mile and a rate per minute is usually then added up to a minimum taxicab road speed. When the <b>passenger</b> <b>steps</b> inside the taxicab, the flagfall condition is triggered and the taxicab driver can start the taximeter. Even if the passenger has not yet instructed the driver where to take them, the driver is entitled to the flagfall and the rate per minute component (even if the taxi is not moving). The term, [...] "Flagfall" [...] {{dates back to the}} old mechanical taximeters, which were equipped with a flag-like lever that could be seen from outside the cab. When the [...] "flag" [...] was up and visible, the cab was not occupied. When a <b>passenger</b> <b>stepped</b> in, the driver turned the lever down - the [...] "flag fall" [...] - and the taximeter started counting. In Australia, once the taximeter is counting, there are orange tariff indicator lights on the taxi head sign which light up to show the taxicab is hired.|$|R
6000|$|Nobody washes out {{the corner}} of the corridor, though we stop at {{stations}} long enough, and there are two more hours journey. Train officials go by and stare, <b>passengers</b> <b>step</b> over and stare, new-comers stare and step over. Somebody asks who? Nobody thinks of just throwing a pail of water. Why should they? It is all in the course of nature.--One begins to be a bit chary of this same [...] "nature", in the south.|$|R
50|$|TIAS {{provides}} {{ground handling}} services, which includes baggage handling, aircraft load control, aerobridge and <b>passenger</b> <b>steps</b> operation, {{loading and unloading}} of aircraft, and cargo and mail delivery, to airline customers. TIAS also provides passenger and flight handling services, which includes passenger check-in, ticketing, flight dispatch, and cargo documentation. TIAS provides handling for 30 airlines out of 38 that operates in Taoyuan International Airport. Therefore, the company had a market share of over 75% in handling services at Taoyuan International Airport.|$|R
60|$|A large {{limousine}} {{passed him}} slowly, crawling up Fifth Avenue. Lutchester, {{with all his}} gifts of observation dormant, took no notice of its occupant, who leaned forward, raised the speaking-tube to his lips, and talked {{for a moment to}} his chauffeur. The car glided round a side street and came to a standstill against the curb. Its solitary <b>passenger</b> <b>stepped</b> quietly out and entered a restaurant. The chauffeur backed the car a little, slipped from his place, and followed Lutchester.|$|R
25|$|Overhead lines supply {{electricity}} {{to the vast}} majority of light rail systems. This avoids the danger of <b>passengers</b> <b>stepping</b> on an electrified third rail. The Docklands Light Railway uses an inverted third rail for its electrical power, which allows the electrified rail to be covered and the power drawn from the underside. Trams in Bordeaux, France, use a special third-rail configuration where the power is only switched on beneath the trams, making it safe on city streets. Several systems in Europe and a few recently opened systems in North America use diesel-powered trains.|$|R
50|$|After {{a week of}} frantic effort hiring staff, {{borrowing}} a tin shed at the RAAF base at Laverton because Essendon Airport {{had been}} turned into mud by heavy rain, creating operations manuals, passenger manifests, tickets, and load sheets — even making <b>passenger</b> <b>steps</b> and baggage carts because {{there was no time to}} buy them in the ordinary way — Captains Hepburn and Nickels took off from Laverton at 5:45 am bound for Sydney. TAA's first scheduled flight carried a full load of VIPs and just one paying passenger.|$|R
50|$|On 20 September 2003, {{an unusual}} {{incident}} occurred near Villeneuve-Triage station. A southbound train stopped at 18:50 {{on the central}} track near the station due to an incident. Passengers aboard were invited to step off the train by the left, as track 2M has been neutralised by the regulators. However, due to a misuse of the alarm signal by nervous passengers, some doors opened on the right. Ignoring the driver's orders, numerous <b>passengers</b> <b>stepped</b> off on the right, and were confronted with a northbound train, travelling at around 110 km/h.|$|R

50|$|The Oregon & California Railroad Ferry No. 2 {{initially}} served Portland, providing connectivity {{between the}} East Portland terminus of the O&C Railroad line and Downtown Portland. It {{was put into}} service in 1879 by Henry Villard, to replace an aging ferry initially set up by Ben Holladay. Differing accounts have the boat built on the East Coast and coming to Portland around Cape Horn, or else being built in Portland. The Portland ferry service {{was the subject of}} a court case appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court: in November 1878, a drunken <b>passenger</b> <b>stepped</b> off the boat before it landed, and drowned.|$|R
50|$|The MP70 was {{an early}} attempt to {{increase}} capacity of commuter trains without lengthening the train, foreshadowing the successful gallery cars introduced after World War II. The car was not a true bilevel design. It featured a single level with a centerline aisle, and two levels of seats, with the second staggered above the first. <b>Passengers</b> <b>stepped</b> up or down to reach the seats, which were in a facing 2×2 arrangement. This unusual arrangement was devised by Albert E. Hutt in 1928. The original prototype trailer seated 120 passengers, the first prototype motor car 134; all others 132.|$|R
50|$|Buses are {{sometimes}} fitted with curb feelers, which can assist the driver {{in ensuring that}} the bus is {{close enough to the}} curb to allow <b>passengers</b> to <b>step</b> to and from the curb easily.|$|R
50|$|The airport has two taxiways, Alpha and Bravo, that {{directly}} {{leads to the}} tarmac, or aircraft parking zone, from the runway. The tarmac can accommodate a maximum of four aircraft; two wide-body Boeing 747-400s, a wide-body McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and a narrow-body Airbus A320 can be parked there at once. The airport has two boarding bridges and two <b>passenger</b> <b>steps.</b> The parking points are usually empty {{as most of the}} planes that arrive there takeoff soon after and the planes of local airlines are generally parked at Shahjalal International Airport overnight. A small civil plane hangar belonging to Biman is available but is rarely used.|$|R
60|$|One <b>passenger</b> <b>stepped</b> off the train--a tall {{fellow in}} a faded lieutenant's uniform, who {{walked with a}} barely {{perceptible}} limp. He had a bronzed face {{and there were some}} grey hairs in the ruddy curls that clustered around his forehead. The new station agent looked at him anxiously. He was used to seeing the khaki-clad figures come off the train, some met by a tumultuous crowd, others, who had sent no word of their coming, stepping off quietly like this one. But there was a certain distinction of bearing and features in this soldier that caught his attention and made him wonder a little more interestedly who he was.|$|R
50|$|Improve {{safety for}} {{passengers}} boarding and alighting at these stops; unmodified stops require <b>passengers</b> to <b>step</b> into traffic to board/alight. The safety concerns are mostly {{with regard to}} drivers who are inexperienced at driving among streetcars in mixed traffic.|$|R

5000|$|A recent {{development}} is the controversial use of backscatter X-rays to detect hidden weapons and explosives on passengers. These devices, which use Compton scattering, require that the passenger stand close to a flat panel and produce a high resolution image. [...] A technology released in Israel in early 2008 allows passengers to pass through metal detectors without removing their shoes, a process required as walk-though gate detectors are not reliable in detecting metal in shoes or on the lower body extremities. Alternately, the <b>passengers</b> <b>step</b> fully shoed onto a device which scans in under 1.2 seconds for objects {{as small as a}} razor blade.In some countries, specially trained individuals may engage passengers in a conversation to detect threats rather than solely relying on equipment to find threats.|$|R
5000|$|The {{driver and}} front <b>passenger</b> had <b>steps</b> provided, {{but they were}} just a simple piece of angled steel welded {{to the bottom of}} the truck. It too was prone to icing as it was {{directly}} behind the front tires, and it also contributed to fall injuries.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cars had}} a light, but strong semi-unit {{body with a}} {{perimeter}} frame. Because of the encircling frame, <b>passengers</b> <b>stepped</b> down into the vehicles. Hudson's step-down design made the body lower than contemporary cars. It offered passengers the safety of being surrounded by the car's chassis with a lower center of gravity. In addition to the added safety of being surrounded by the car's chassis, the step-down also allowed Hudson to gain weight savings provided through unibody construction, making for a well-performing automobile. The cars featured slab-sided bodies with fully integrated fenders. Brougham and sedans were fastbacks while convertibles and coupes were notchbacks. A character line ran from the front to back further lowering the car even more visually, so [...] "the new Hudson looked like a dream car straight from the auto show." ...|$|R
5000|$|The image fades to {{show the}} square many years later. As there is {{graffiti}} {{on the walls and}} people are dressed in modern clothes, a Citroën BX is parked on the square - the time is clearly [...] "the present" [...] (then being 1992, as the episode was first broadcast then). A grey Mercedes drives into the square. As the driver steps out, {{it turns out to be}} a very old Von Strohm. The two <b>passengers</b> <b>step</b> out from the back seat and turn out to be the equally old Gruber and Helga. They spot the statue of René and then go into the café, to see if René is still there. As Gruber orders Von Strohm to wait by the car and he answers [...] "Yes, sir", he obviously is Gruber's servant.|$|R
50|$|The first Tu-114, {{registration}} CCCP-Л5611, {{was first}} {{shown to the}} West in 1958 at the Brussels World Exhibition. It later carried Nikita Khrushchev on {{his first trip to}} the US, the first such visit by any Soviet leader. When it arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, the ground crew found that the aircraft was so large and its landing gear so tall that they had no <b>passenger</b> <b>steps</b> high enough to reach the forward hatch. Khrushchev and his party were obliged to use the aircraft's own emergency escape ladder. The last flight of this particular plane was in 1968, and it is now on display at the Central Air Force Museum at Monino, outside of Moscow. Similar issues were experienced when the plane first landed at London and Paris airports, neither of which had hosted a plane of this size.|$|R
60|$|He {{pointed to}} the stairs, and his friend, going to his side, saw a <b>passenger</b> just <b>stepping</b> into a boat. The two men then turned away until, at sight of Captain Flower’s head {{appearing}} above the side, they went off into such silent manifestations of horror and astonishment that he feared for their reason.|$|R
50|$|This bus has a high-floor, & in {{addition}} to the driver's door, has just 1 automatic <b>passenger</b> door with <b>steps.</b> It is 7.4-7.7 metres long & has 17-19 seats.|$|R
