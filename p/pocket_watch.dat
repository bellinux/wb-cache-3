5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's <b>pocket</b> <b>watch,</b> proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's <b>pocket</b> <b>watch</b> fall out of his pocket so that it would not disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. It became more difficult for writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{wristwatch}} {{goes back to the}} production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch from Robert Dudley in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was {{not just a matter of}} fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. When the waistcoat was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of Charles II in the 17th century, the <b>pocket</b> <b>watch</b> was tucked into its pocket. Prince Albert, the consort to Queen Victoria, introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the <b>pocket</b> <b>watch</b> to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as bracelets, for women.|$|E

50|$|The Trench watch (wristlet) was {{a type of}} {{watch that}} came into use by the {{military}} during World War I, as <b>pocket</b> <b>watches</b> were not practical in combat.

Charles leaves the house, intending to return to the United States, wondering whether Sarah is a manipulative, lying woman who exploited him.|$|E
5|$|Between 1794 and 1795, in the {{aftermath}} of the French Revolution, the French government briefly mandated decimal clocks, with a day divided into 10hours of 100minutes each. The astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, among other individuals, modified the dial of his <b>pocket</b> <b>watch</b> to decimal time. A clock in the Palais des Tuileries kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread. Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the metric system, and it was abandoned.|$|E

With all flights canceled due to a snowstorm, Christian and Aaron spend an intimate night in a motel. When Christian awakes, he finds Aaron gone. Aaron's <b>pocket</b> <b>watch,</b> a family heirloom, has been left behind. Christian returns to Los Angeles. In Idaho, Aaron is excommunicated by the church elders, led by his own father, Farron, who is the stake president.

Overwhelmed by despair, Aaron attempts suicide. He is subsequently sent by his parents to a treatment facility to be cured of his homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the campaigning {{season of}} 1864, Cleburne became engaged to Susan Tarleton of Mobile, Alabama. Their {{marriage}} {{was never to}} be, as Cleburne was killed during an ill-conceived assault (which he opposed) on Union fortifications at the Battle of Franklin, just south of Nashville, Tennessee, on November 30, 1864. He was last seen advancing on foot toward the Union line with his sword raised, after his horse was shot out from under him. Accounts later {{said that he was}} found just inside the Federal line and his body carried back to an aid station along the Columbia Turnpike. Confederate war records indicate he died of a shot to the abdomen, or possibly a bullet that went through his heart. When Confederates found his body, he had been picked clean of any valuable items, including his sword, boots and <b>pocket</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence and produced by Caleb Dewart of DNA Inc. The video deals directly with the lyrics' theme of Stefani's search for inspiration in songwriting. It opens with a lengthy non-musical section in which Stefani arrives in Los Angeles off of No Doubt's Rock Steady Tour. She receives several calls from Interscope label head Jimmy Iovine, who attempts to push her forward with her solo debut project, but she replies that she is tired and uninspired. After a failed studio attempt, Stefani sees a flyer advertising help for writer's block. Upon arrival she is asked {{to fill out a}} suspicious questionnaire, where the camera pans to the questions which will be important. She is then told that she will be billed when she is finished. She asks for clarification only to discover that she is already back in the studio by herself. When Stefani picks up an oversized <b>pocket</b> <b>watch</b> from the piano, a rabbit knick-knack that she had previously seen jumps across the room. She throws the watch at the knick-knack, causing her to fall back on her chair and find herself transported to a fantasy world based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass.|$|E

500|$|In 1675, Huygens and Robert Hooke {{invented the}} spiral balance, or the hairspring, {{designed}} {{to control the}} oscillating speed of the balance wheel. This crucial advance finally made accurate <b>pocket</b> <b>watches</b> possible. [...] This resulted in a great advance in accuracy of <b>pocket</b> <b>watches,</b> from perhaps several hours per day to 10minutes per day, similar {{to the effect of}} the pendulum upon mechanical clocks. The great English clockmaker, Thomas Tompion, {{was one of the first}} to use this mechanism successfully in his <b>pocket</b> <b>watches,</b> and he adopted the minute hand which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilised into the modern-day configuration.|$|R

25|$|In 1675, Huygens {{patented}} a <b>pocket</b> <b>watch.</b> The watches {{which were}} made in Paris from c. 1675 and following the Huygens plan are notable for lacking a fusee for equalizing the mainspring torque. The implication is that Huygens thought that his spiral spring would isochronise the balance, {{in the same way}} that he thought that the cycloidally shaped suspension curbs on his clocks would isochronise the pendulum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pocket</b> <b>watch</b> style meters were in {{widespread}} {{use in the}} 1920s, at much lower cost than Avometers. The metal case was typically connected to the negative connection, an arrangement that caused numerous electric shocks.

5000|$|The rise of railroading {{during the}} last half of the 19th century led to the {{widespread}} use of <b>pocket</b> <b>watches.</b> A famous train wreck on the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway in Kipton, Ohio on April 19, 1891 occurred because one of the engineers' watches had stopped for four minutes. The railroad officials commissioned Webb C. Ball as their Chief Time Inspector, in order to establish precision standards and a reliable timepiece inspection system for Railroad chronometers. This led to the adoption in 1893 of stringent standards for <b>pocket</b> <b>watches</b> used in railroading. These railroad-grade <b>pocket</b> <b>watches,</b> as they became colloquially known, had to meet the General Railroad Timepiece Standards adopted in 1893 by almost all railroads.
