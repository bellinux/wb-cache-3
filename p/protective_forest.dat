40|$|AbstractThe world’s forests provide {{fundamental}} {{protection of}} soil and water resources as well as multiple ecosystem services and cultural or spiritual values. We summarized the FRA 2015 data for protective functions and ecosystem services, and analyzed increasing or decreasing trends of protective areas. The global forest area managed for protection {{of soil and}} water was 1. 002 billionha as of 2015, which was 25. 1 % of all global forested areas. Protective forests have increased by 0. 181 billionha over the past 25 years mainly because more countries are now reporting <b>protective</b> <b>forest</b> areas (139 in 2015 vs 114 in 1990). However, average percentage of designated for protective forests did not change significantly from 1990 to 2015. Global forest area managed for ecosystem services is also now at 25. 4 % of global total forest area and has changed little over the past 25 years. Among the twelve categories of protective forests, flood control, public recreation, and cultural services increased {{both in terms of}} percentage of total forest area and the number of reporting countries. Public awareness of the importance of forest resources for functions and services other than production continues to increase as evidenced by the increase of <b>protective</b> <b>forest</b> designations and reporting in many countries. Percentages of total forest area designated for both protective forests and ecosystem services show a dual-peak distribution of numbers of countries concentrated at 0 % and 100 %. This suggests a socio-economic influence for the designations. We examined five case study countries (Australia, Canada, China, Kenya, and Russia). The most dramatic changes in the past 25 years have been in China where protective forests for soil and water resources increased from about 12 % to 28 % of forest area. The Russian Federation has also increased percentages of forest area devoted to soil and water resource protection and delivery of ecosystem services. Australia is now reporting in more <b>protective</b> <b>forest</b> categories whereas Kenya and Canada changed little. These five countries have their own classification of forest functions and recalculation methods of reporting for FRA 2015 were different.

To assist postfire assessment teams {{in their efforts to}} evaluate fire effects and make postfire treatment decisions, a web-based Erosion Risk Management Tool (ERMiT) has been developed. ERMiT uses the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model to predict postfire hillslope erosion and to evaluate the potential effectiveness of some common hillslope erosion mitigation practices. The model uses a probabilistic approach that incorporates variability in climate, soil properties, and burn severity for forests, rangeland, and chaparral hillslopes. For user specified climate, burn severity, and soil conditions, ERMiT produces a distribution of erosion rates with a likelihood of their occurrence for each of five years after the fire. ERMiT also provides single-event erosion rate distributions for hillslopes that have been treated with seed, straw mulch, and erosion barriers. ERMiT’s outputs help managers establish the probability associated with a given level of sediment yield for a given location, and this information can be used along with information about the value of resources at risk and acceptable loss thresholds to make postfire erosion treatment decisions.

Photogrammetric measurements of tree variables (height, crown diameter), necessary for DBH estimation, were carried out in the stereomodels of colour infrared digital images of 30 cmand 10 cm spatial resolution, i. e. ground sample distance (GSD) using digital photogrammetric workstation. Results: The repeated measures ANOVA testing determined statistically significant differences between the results obtained by terrestrial and photogrammetric measurements (GSD 10 cm and GSD 30 cm) of the arithmetic mean DBH of subcompartments. Furthermore, the testing determined no statistically significant differences between the 2 ̆ 7 trends 2 ̆ 7 of estimating DBH by different methods. In other words, a 2 ̆ 7 pattern of constant overestimation 2 ̆ 7 of DBH, taken by the photogrammetric measurement in relation to terrestrial measurement, was noted for all subcompartments.
