Nonetheless, {{it should not be}} overlooked that Bentham's [...] "hedonistic" [...] theory (a term from J.J.C. Smart), unlike Mill's, is often criticized for lacking a principle of fairness embodied in a conception of justice. In Bentham and the Common Law Tradition, Gerald J. Postema states: [...] "No moral concept suffers more at Bentham's hand than the concept of justice. There is no sustained, mature analysis of the notion..." [...] Thus, some critics object, it would be acceptable to torture one person if this would produce an amount of happiness in other people outweighing the unhappiness of the tortured individual. However, as P. J. Kelly argued in Utilitarianism and Distributive Justice: Jeremy Bentham and the Civil Law, Bentham had a theory of justice that prevented such consequences. According to Kelly, for Bentham the law [...] "provides the basic framework of social interaction by delimiting spheres of <b>personal</b> <b>inviolability</b> within which individuals can form and pursue their own conceptions of well-being". It provides security, a precondition for the formation of expectations. As the hedonic calculus shows [...] "expectation utilities" [...] to be much higher than natural ones, it follows that Bentham does not favour the sacrifice of a few to the benefit of the many.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{basically}} concerned with asylum in European antiquity. In present day Europe {{the right to}} asylum first and foremost constitutes a complex field of political and legal discourses that are, however, rarely viewed in a larger historical perspective. Consequently, there is little academic reflection on the assumptions, components or values founding {{the basis for the}} general idea of asylum. The intention {{of this paper is to}} carry out precisely such a reflection, focusing on how asylum was originally thought out, practised and substantiated at the very outset in European culture. In this way, the motivation behind this paper stems from present circumstances, while at the same time pointing at the necessity of a historical analysis. The field of research is thus in general terms asylum i European antiquity. In recognising the broadness and complexity of the antiquity, the field of research is, however, delimited by focusing on four focal points, namely (1) the Old Testament or the Israelitic tradition, (2) Greek antiquity, (3) the New Testament and (4) Roman antiquity. Each of these focal points is being treated in separate chapters, were they are subjected to a thorough, interdisciplinary study concerned with whether and how asylum appears terminologically, philosophically, religiously as well as on a legal or in other ways practical level. In this way, the analytical scope is narrowed by delimiting the field of research to certain focal points, yet broadened by insisting on a interdisciplinary approach to the subject matter. In chapter one, dealing with the Israelitic tradition of the Old Testament, the study concludes that asylum first of all appears as a right, and is thereby linked to the legal thinking of the Pentateuch in general and to the apodictic laws in particular. More specifically, the right to asylum specified in the Pentateuch is granted to people guilty of involuntary manslaughter, protecting them against vendetta in the so-called cities of refuge. As the right to asylum is restricted to these biblical cities, the right of asylum becomes territorial. The territorial right of asylum is, however, not the only phenomenon of the Old Testament that can be linked to asylum protection; throughout the Pentateuch, the general right of the stranger is constituted through a number of commands protecting the stranger against encroachment and, in short, the stranger is thereby in many ways given the same legal status as the Israelites, as well as being included in the social teaching Yahweh demand of his people. The paper argues that the right of the stranger is closely linked to the friendship of the guest, widely acknowledged in the Mediterranean area in antiquity, and is substantiated by the vast Israelitic experience of diaspora. As such, the right of the stranger builds on a principle of reciprocity also known in the law of retaliation, lex talionis, and following the logic of reciprocity the people of Israel should thus welcome, include and treat the guest properly, because they remember (and it is their duty to remember) life in exile. In the right of the stranger, as chapter one concludes, we find an ethical obligation towards the stranger, that points towards a modern conception of asylum. Inclusion is however not the sole approach to the stranger in the Pentateuch; other passages command banishing of other peoples, intolerance and genocide. The voices of the Pentateuch concerning the stranger are thus polyphonic, but a clear voice of tolerance and inclusion are non the less identifiable. As the paper concludes in chapter two, the link between territorial asylum and the containment of vendetta against involuntary manslaughter is rediscovered in a Greek legal context, and hence the linking is not exclusively an Israelitic phenomenon. In a Greek context, territorial asylum is however first and foremost in post-Homeric time understood as inviolability in some Greek city states and at sacred places, denoted by the term ásylon. Inviolability is here guarantied by reference to divine jurisdiction. Beside the actual claims on territorial inviolability identified and discussed in chapter 2, asylum also appears as a distinct, literary theme in the classical Greek tragedies by respectively Aeschylos, Sophocles and Euripides. Here, the act of giving and respecting territorial asylum in precisely city states and at sacred places constitutes a norm that reaches beyond the literary sphere, due to the mythologicalreligious character of the tragedies. It is furthermore concluded that beside denoting territorial asylum, ásylon also refers to a secular practise that is best described as <b>personal</b> asylum, providing <b>inviolability</b> to appointed citizens, typically to the so-called proxenoi representing the polis in interstate diplomacy. Finally, a few aspects from the golden age of Greek philosophy are shortly treated at the end of chapter two, first and foremost the philosophy of friendship dealt with by Aristotle and the stoics. It is concluded that the philosophical concept of friendship implicate an underlying idea about the natural fellowship of mankind, echoing the very kernel of the right of asylum, namely being committed on the well-being of - in abstract terms - the other. Having given a thorough analysis of the Greek tradition, the paper once again focuses on a Biblical context, specifically on those ethical aspects of the New Testament that most clearly implicate, or bluntly commands, other-concern. The ethics of the New Testament is initially approached by analysing the paramount reinterpretation of the Israelitic-Jewish concept of law by Jesus Christ in the Gospels, and it is made clear that the various commandments binding Israel to include, respect and love the other are fundamentally replaced (encompassed, absorbed) by the Great Commandment to love God and to love one's neighbour as oneself. By reaffirming the Great Commandment of benevolence, as well as remodelling it into the crucial point from which all morality flows, Jesus both reaffirms the teaching of the Torah and definitively breaks with the ethical position of classical, Jerusalemitic Judaism. Other-concern is hereby placed at the very centre of the ethical thinking, and as the scope of ‘the other’ is furthermore broadened by perceiving not only the neighbour, but also one’s enemy (cf. Matthew 5 : 44) as the object of Christian benevolence or unselfish love, complying with the ethical standards of the New Testament becomes first and foremost a matter of being committed to the well-being of others. In this aspect, the ethics of the New Testament can be seen as a theological completion of the philosophical thinking about a fellowship of mankind suggested in a Greek context. This thinking constitutes a radical new view on man as such, and thus becomes relevant in the analysis of asylum in especially Roman antiquity, which becomes the subject matter of the last part of the analysis in chapter four. In many ways Roman antiquity integrates the various expressions of the general idea about asylum protection identified throughout the preceding chapters of the paper. First of all it becomes clear that asylum - appears in Roman, mythological literature too - partly as Roman receptions of Biblical and Greek mythological material, partly in the dominant mythological narrative concerned with how Rome was founded. On at literary-mythological level, the paper argues, asylum constitutes a norm, and a continuation of the Greek tradition is with regard to this aspect identified. Furthermore, in the dominant mythological narrative on how Rome was founded, the Roman population is outlined from outsiders through Roman citizenship, not through ethnicity or language, and as citizenship was initially given to everyone, the borderline between Romans and ‘others’ or ‘strangers’ were from the mythological starting point blurred. The paper argues that when redirecting the perspective from mythological to historical time, the boundary between ‘Romans’ and ‘strangers’ continues to be hazy at a deeper level, as all people subjected to Rome in time were given the possibility to obtain Roman citizenship. Community is so thought of in a broader way, which is also reflected in the Roman philosophical thinking on friendship. This is clearly the case with Cicero, who builds on Aristotle and the stoics when expressing the view that man is by nature enrolled in a binding community with all other fellow human beings, a communis humani generis societas. Cicero sharpens the Aristotelian-stoic analysis of friendship and community on the basis of natural law, though still being far from the radical thinking of the New Testament where other-concern is placed before anything else. Beside reflecting on mythology, norms and community, the paper stresses that the territorial right of asylum appears in Roman antiquity too, typically denoted by the Latin term asylum. It is however made clear that one must distinguish between republican and imperial time; the paper concludes that a broadly continuation of the Greek tradition for territorial asylum is seen in republican time, whereas the inviolability in city states and at sacred places is abandoned early in imperial time. Yet a novel variety of territorial asylum is identified in imperial time, namely asylum in the vicinity of images of the emperor. As it was not utterly clear as to what extent this sort of ‘imperial asylum’ were provided for Roman citizens exclusively or, alternatively, thought of as a more universal means of protection, guarantying inviolability to all human beings, a discussion about the asylum right of slaves is presented at the end of chapter four. In short, the paper concludes that though criticism were definitively voiced in imperial time, slaves were - at least in theory - as non-citizens protected by the imperial asylum on equal terms with Roman citizens. Thereby the imperial asylum must be seen as an indication of the fact, that the right of asylum was in late Roman antiquity linked to human beings as such - not to citizenship - substantiated on the basis of natural law. Based on the overall analysis of asylum i European antiquity, the paper concludes that the general idea about asylum was indeed present in the antiquity, partly in different traditions (Israelitic, Greek, Roman), partly manifested within different fields (religion, mythology, literature, law). On a practical level, asylum is often put into practise by territorial rights, and though the specific minting of the rights differ in accordance with the context in which they appear - especially with regards to substantiation and scope - a structural similarity between the antique traditions studied is indeed traceable. On a more abstract level, the paper furthermore argues that the appearance of asylum in antiquity must partly be seen in relation to the development of a line of thought - be it theological or philosophical - according to which man is connected to his fellow human beings in a binding community...|$|R

In Polish law legal titles of the deprivation of liberty are highly diversified. They comprise repressive measures, e. g. the deprivation of liberty for criminal offences and transgressions, and to some extent, e. g. in military law, for disciplinary delicts, preventive measures in criminal proceedings, arrest and preliminary detention, executive measures in civil and criminal proceedings, forced hospitalization, e. g. of people with contagious diseases, or of people who commited offences but who require medical treatment in isolation due to the threat they constitute to others, measures applied towards addicts. internment in extraordinary situations, measures applied for diagnostic ses, etc. A new constitution should determine the grounds and purposes of the deprivation of liberty so that {{to reduce the number of}} situations when a citizen may be deprived of liberty.

The maximum duration of arrest without the court decision should not exceed 24 hours, and the arrested should be informed immediately about the grounds of arrest.

40|$|In legal writing various views {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{with respect to}} the consent of the entitled person. According to the prevailing view, {{it is one of the}} conditions eliminating the unlawfulness of the infringement of personal interests. However, the proponents of this view admit that consent fulfills many functions. It may eliminate the very infringement of some personal interests (image, secrecy of mail). The most important function of consent consists in its capacity to eliminate the unlawfulness of behaviour. The article contains the analysis of the above problems on the basis of Polish civil law. It does not consider penal law issues. The author is of the opinion that providing for the conditions of validity of consent in the amended Civil Code is not necessary. According to a rather generally accepted view, the consent of the entitled person is a unilateral revokable legal action Legal consequences occur here irrespective of the intention of the acting behavior. The borderline between the consent of the entitled person and the activity undertaken at one's own risk is blurred. The article contains a detailed analysis of the application of consent. The consent of the entitled person is very important in medical treatment. In principle, any treatment, especially surgery, requires the consent of the patient. Similar situation takes place in matters of special interest today (e. g. the admissibility of ex vivo transplants). Here, very strict criteria of consent should be applied. Next, the author discusses the application of consent in sport. The participation in brutal or dangerous sport competitions (especially in boxing) is tantamount to the consent to slight bodily injury and infringement of <b>personal</b> <b>inviolability.</b> The article contains also the analysis of the consequences of consent in the sphere of protection of other personal interests (especially privacy). In the sphere of personal interest protection the Roman Law adage volenti non jit iniuria is of limited significance. The intencity of personal interests protection would be weakened if too wide application of the construction of consent were adopted. Its subjective and objective premises must be precisely determined. There is no uniform answer to the question of how the freedom of decision of a person who gives his/her consent is shaped...|$|E
40|$|Diplomatic {{immunity}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} elements of foreign relations, dating back as far as Ancient Greece and Rome. Today, it is a principle that has been codified into the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations regulating past customs and practices. Consuls and international organizations, although their privileges and immunities are similar to diplomatic personnel, do differ and are regulated by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the United Nations International Immunities respectively. These Conventions have been influenced by past practices and by three theories during different era’s namely exterritoriality, personal representation and functional necessity. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations further provides certain immunities and privileges to different levels of diplomatic officials, their staff and families. Privileges and immunities will be considered under various main categories, namely the diplomatic mission, the diplomatic official, diplomatic staff, and families. Each category receives privileges and immunities, for example immunities enjoyed by the diplomatic mission include mission correspondence and bags. Diplomatic officials enjoy <b>personal</b> <b>inviolability,</b> immunity from jurisdiction and inviolability of diplomats’ residences and property. The staff and families of diplomatic officials too enjoy privileges and immunities. The problem of so many people receiving privileges and immunities is that there is a high likelihood of abuse. Abuses that arise are various crimes committed by diplomats, their staff and families. They are immune from local punishment and appear to be above the local law. Although the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations provides remedies against diplomats, staff and families who abuse their position, it gives the impression that it is not enough. Various Acts in the United Kingdom, United States and the Republic of South Africa will be analysed in order to ascertain what governments have done to try and curb diplomatic abuses. Each will be considered and found that although they have restricted immunity from previous practices it still places the diplomats’ needs above its own citizens. Thus several suggestions have been put forward and argued whether they are successful in restricting immunity comprehensively. Such suggestions are amending the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations; using the functional necessity theory to further limit immunity; forming bilateral treaties between States as a possible means to restrict or limit; and lastly establishing a Permanent International Diplomatic Criminal Court. The key question to be answered is whether diplomatic immunity is needed for the efficient functioning of foreign relations between States...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, the law {{has largely}} ‘understood’ and {{regulated}} prostitution {{on the basis of}} some form of moral reflection on the sale of sex. Such a reflection is evident in recent policy efforts to criminalise the sale and/or purchase of sex, as outlined in inter alia the so-called ‘Honeyball Report’. The report suggests that prostitution is a violation of human dignity, which leads to a call to action to criminalise the purchase of sex. This study engages with this proposition, and poses the question: ‘Does prostitution violate human dignity? There are three core themes of dignity identified across the literature, in human rights theory and in international human rights law, as well as in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), grounded in an understanding that human dignity is inherent and inalienable in all persons. As the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and its associated international conventions recognize, this concept of inherent human dignity is the bedrock upon which human rights are founded. Modern conceptualisations of human dignity constructed by US scholars are appraised and three key descriptive elements of dignity; Inherence, <b>Personal</b> <b>Inviolability</b> and Autonomy are drawn together to form a model, called ‘IPA’ dignity. Thereafter, the idea of dignity violation is explored and examined using the jurisprudence of Article 3 ECHR to demonstrate judicial recognition of the idea of violation. This ‘violation’ of dignity as expounded examines various ways in which dignity may be violated. The model is critiqued, and it is established that in order to answer the hypothesis question, a descriptive model of dignity requires some normative framework in order that it be utilised to assess the dignity violation of sex workers in prostitution. The model is considered in a normative usage, according to the natural law theory of John Finnis in Natural Law and Natural Rights, in which Finnis sets out a normative call to action for the promotion of certain objective goods, the collective of which amounts to a life ‘worth pursuing’. To provide a sociological context for the study, the subject of prostitution is introduced as it is understood in the academic discipline of sociology, and relevant literature therein is reviewed around the central issue of what is termed here ‘the prostitution encounter’; that is, the sale/purchase of sexual services. A sociological explanatory model called the Gender and Male Violence Model (GMV) is justified as most appropriate for the study. Narratives taken from the seminal literature in the sociology of prostitution are analysed using a phenomenological method to consider the experiences of the sex worker of the prostitution encounter, and an evaluation is made as to potential modes of dignity violation within the prostitution encounter. This leads to an indication that the human dignity, modelled as IPA dignity and framed with the normative call to action of Finnis which directs that human agents should promote human flourishing and, a fortiori dignity, may be violated. Using these methods, the study concludes by indicating that prostitution may indeed violate human dignity...|$|E
