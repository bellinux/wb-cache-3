However, plaster of Paris casts take too long to fully dry and limits <b>patient</b> <b>mobility</b> for up to 74 hours — if the patient walks on the cast during this time, the shape will change, and the cast will not protect the foot and wound correctly. Fiberglass casts were introduced in the 1980 or '90s.

The <b>patients</b> <b>mobility</b> issue began to emerge in Italy with the 1992 reform that assigned the Regions with the responsibility of safeguarding the population health, as well as being responsible for maintaning a balanced financial position. The article highlights the existence of a structural asymmetry among the regional health systems by analysing the flows of patients among the Regions. This scenario needs to be governed according to a national perspective in relation to the serious financial difficulties experienced by the Regions of South Italy, in order to avoid putting at risk the economic sustainability of the whole system, as well as the ability to provide services which are qualitatively and quantitatively adequate for the entire Italian population...|$|R

50|$|For {{countries}} {{within the}} European Union, dental qualifications {{are required to}} reach a minimum approved by each country’s government. Thus a dentist qualified in one country can apply to any other EU country to practice in that country, allowing for greater mobility of labour for dentists (Directives typically apply {{not only to the}} EU but to the wider designation of the European Economic Area - EEA). The Association for Dental Education in Europe (ADEE) has standardization efforts to harmonize European standards. Proposals from the ADEE's Quality Assurance and Benchmarking taskforce cover the introduction of accreditation procedures for EU dentistry universities as well as programmes to facilitate dental students completing part of their education in foreign dentistry schools.

5000|$|During {{the course}} of the illness, the <b>patient's</b> <b>mobility</b> is {{progressively}} restricted as it becomes hard for him or her to bend down, reach for things, walk quickly and so on. Many patients say they have balance problems and fall easily, as the muscles cannot compensate for an off-balanced posture.

5000|$|The muscle {{spasticity}} {{can cause}} gait patterns to be awkward and jerky.

50|$|PD is less {{efficient}} at removing wastes {{from the body}} than hemodialysis, {{and the presence of}} the tube presents a risk of peritonitis due to the potential to introduce bacteria to the abdomen. There is not sufficient evidence to be clear about the best treatment for PD-associated peritonitis, although direct infusion of antibiotics into the peritoneum appears to offer slight advantage over the intravenous route of administration; there is no clear advantage for other frequently used treatments such as routine peritoneal lavage or use of urokinase. The tube site can also become infected; the use of prophylactic nasal mupirocin can reduce the number of tube site infections, but does not help with peritonitis. Infections can be as frequent as once every 15 months (0.8 episodes per patient year). Compared to hemodialysis, PD allows greater <b>patient</b> <b>mobility,</b> produces fewer swings in symptoms due to its continuous nature, and phosphate compounds are better removed, but large amounts of albumin are removed which requires constant monitoring of nutritional status. The costs of PD are generally lower than that of HD {{in most parts of the}} world, this cost advantage is most apparent in developed economies. There is insufficient research to adequately compare the risks and benefits between CAPD and APD; a Cochrane Review of three small clinical trials found no difference in clinically important outcomes (i.e. morbidity or mortality) for patients with end stage renal disease, nor was there any advantage in preserving the functionality of the kidneys.

40|$|Objectives To {{develop a}} {{framework}} that parsimoniously explains divergent <b>patient</b> <b>mobility</b> in the United States and Europe. Method Review of studies of patient mobility; data from the 2007 Flash Eurobarometer and the 2001 California Health Interview Survey was analyzed; and we reviewed government policies and documents in the United States and Europe. Results Four types of <b>patient</b> <b>mobility</b> are defined: primary, complementary, duplicative, and institutionalized. Primary exit occurs when people without comprehensive insurance travel because they cannot {{afford to pay for}} health insurance or directly finance care, as in the United States and Mexico. Second, people will exit to buy complementary services not covered, or partially covered by domestic health insurance, in both the United States and Europe. Third, in Europe, <b>patient</b> <b>mobility</b> for duplicative services provides faster or better quality treatment. Finally, governments and insurers can encourage institutionalized exit through expanded delivery options and financing. Institutionalized exit is developing in Europe, but uncoordinated and geographically limited in the United States.

40|$|<b>Patient</b> <b>mobility</b> is a {{key issue}} in the EU which {{recently}} passed a new law on a patient’s right to EU-wide provider choice. In this paper we use a Hotelling model with two regions that differ in technology to study the impact of <b>patient</b> <b>mobility</b> on health care quality, health care financing and welfare. We show that without <b>patient</b> <b>mobility</b> quality is too low (high) and too few (many) patients are treated in the high-skill (low-skill) region. The effects of <b>patient</b> <b>mobility</b> depend on the transfer payment. If the payment is below marginal cost, mobility leads to a ‘race-to-the-bottom’ in quality and lower welfare in both regions. If the payment is equal to marginal cost, quality and welfare remain unchanged in the high-skill region, but the low-skill region benefits. For a socially optimal payment, which is higher than marginal cost, quality levels in the two regions are closer to (but not at) the first best, but welfare is lower in the low-skill region. Thus, <b>patient</b> <b>mobility</b> can have adverse effects on quality provision and welfare unless an appropriate transfer payment scheme is implemented.

40|$|AbstractWireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) {{consist of}} tiny Biomedical Wireless Sensors (BWSs) and a Gate Way (GW) {{to connect to}} the {{external}} databases {{in the hospital and}} medical centres. The GW could connect the BWSs, to a range of wireless telecommunication networks. These wireless telecommunication networks could be either a mobile phone network, a standard telephone network, a dedicated medical centre or using public Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) nodes also known a Wi-Fi system. The electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are widely used in health care systems because they are non-invasive mechanisms to establish medical diagnosis of heart diseases. The current ECG systems suffer from important limitations: limited <b>patient's</b> <b>mobility,</b> limited energy, limited on wireless applications. The main drawback of current ECG systems is the location-specific nature of the. systems due to the use of fixed/wired applications. That is why; there is a critical need to improve the current ECG systems to cover security handling and to achieve extended <b>patient's</b> <b>mobility.</b> With this in mind, Compressed Sensing (CS) procedure and the collaboration of Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL) framework is used to provide a robust low sampling-rate approach for normal and abnormal ECG signals. Advanced WBANs based on our approach will be able to deliver healthcare not only to patients in hospital and medical centres; but also in their homes and workplaces thus offering cost saving, and improving the quality of life.

40|$|Power {{struggle}} ” {{might seem}} an odd title {{to give to}} a paper about <b>patient</b> <b>mobility</b> law. <b>Patient</b> <b>mobility</b> is about lots of things — legal innovation, cross-border regions, medical tourism, competition, and, of course, patients. But power? I argue that <b>patient</b> <b>mobility</b> policy is about power, because it causes two kinds of shifts {{in the distribution of}} power. First, it is about shifts in power between governments- also known as “authority migration ” (Gerber and Kollman, 2004; Orren and Skowronek, 2004). The fact that <b>patient</b> <b>mobility</b> fits into a larger EU regulatory framework driven by EU institutions, means that it comes with a transfer of power to the EU, loss of Member State autonomy, and disruption to relationships between governments within Member States. Second, it can also be a shift in power between different advocates and interest groups, with their different substantive preferences. That depends on different advocates ' ability to exploit new power relationships. As a result, the development of EU <b>patient</b> <b>mobility</b> law is a power struggle. The stakes are which governments do what, how do they constrain each others ' autonomy, and what substantive policy objectives will win as results of the shifting intergovernmental relations sparked by the extension of EU competencies...|$|E
