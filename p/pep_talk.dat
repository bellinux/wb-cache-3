5|$|During the {{preliminary}} round at the World Championships, Sacramone {{qualified for the}} event finals on floor and vault {{and contributed to the}} top-qualifying position of the American team. She also posted a score on beam that would have been high enough to qualify her to the beam final. However, due to an International Federation of Gymnastics rule allowing only two athletes per country to participate in each event final, Sacramone was unable to compete for a beam medal, because teammates Liukin and Shawn Johnson qualified ahead of her. In the team final, she competed on vault, beam and floor, earning scores of 15.750, 15.600 and 15.325, respectively. When the American team faltered after a difficult beam rotation, in which two gymnasts made major errors, Sacramone gathered the team for a <b>pep</b> <b>talk</b> to refocus them for floor. The American team earned 184.400 points overall, which was good enough to secure the gold medal ahead of China and Romania.|$|E

5|$|Xavier {{defeated}} Temple Owls 88–77 on January 22, extending their in-conference home-court {{winning streak}} to 35, surpassing Temple Owls' 34-game in-conference consecutive home victories {{for the longest}} in Atlantic 10 history. Former Xavier player Brian Grant had his jersey retired at halftime, and the team wore throwback uniforms in his honor. Grant gave the Musketeers a <b>pep</b> <b>talk</b> prior to the game, and Xavier opened an early 16–8 lead. Scootie Randall scored Temple Owls' first 10 points, hitting five out of his first six shots. The Owls took their only lead of the half 29–28 off of a three by Randall. In the second half, the teams traded baskets before Xavier went on a 10–0 run. Randall led Temple Owls on an 11–1 run {{to tie the game}} at 66, knocking down two fastbreak layups and a three-point shot, and finished with a career-high 28 points. The Owls took their final lead 69–68 off a Khalif Wyatt three-pointer with 5:30 to go. Afterwards Tu Holloway hit a scoop shot and Mark Lyons had a layup and a steal to give Xavier a 75–69 advantage that they maintained. Holloway scored 21 points and Lyons 19 to score the most points against Temple Owls in the season.|$|E

25|$|Booster {{returns to}} the present, using T. O. Morrow as bait to draw out Skeets. Skeets reveals itself to be Mister Mind in disguise, having used Skeets' shell as a cocoon to evolve into a being capable of devouring the Multiverse. Booster and Rip flee into the timestream with Skeets' remains {{and return to the}} end of the Infinite Crisis. Rip and Booster witness the birth of the new Multiverse, made up of 52 {{identical}} worlds. Mister Mind attempts to trap Booster and Rip in the Phantom Zone which he devoured when it was turned on him, but he is stopped by Supernova (now Daniel Carter, who was saved from the time loop he was trapped in by Rip and given Michael's outfit), who restores the Phantom Zone to its original place. Mister Mind then devours years and events of each of the 52 worlds, altering their history in the process. The real Skeets gives Booster a <b>pep</b> <b>talk</b> which inspires him to stop Mister Mind.|$|E

25|$|After Sora defeats Ansem, all the {{previously}} attacked worlds are restored, including Beast's Castle. Afterwards, Beast and Belle {{return to their}} home to carry on with their lives. However, the peace is shattered once again when Beast is approached by Xaldin of Organization XIII to do his bidding. Xaldin is determined to manipulate Beast into becoming a Heartless. If that happens, Beast will not only become a strong Heartless which Sora would have to destroy and feed to Kingdom Hearts, but also leave behind a powerful Nobody for Xaldin to use as he wishes (just like what happened to Xehanort). Manipulated and controlled, Beast is forced to allow the Heartless into the castle and lock the entire servant staff in the dungeons, with Belle too scared to intervene. Beast starts mistreating Belle. When Sora, Donald and Goofy arrive, they are encountered by Beast, who attacks them without hesitation. Sora wins the battle, and Beast comes back to his senses thanks to his servants who were released by Sora. Xaldin appears to flee. Later on, during a ball, Xaldin returns and steals the rose, throwing Beast into a depression and causing him to ask Belle and Sora to leave his castle. However a <b>pep</b> <b>talk</b> from Sora spurs him back into action. Xaldin confronts them and sends his Nobodies at them. They fight the Nobodies off, but Xaldin escapes to the castle drawbridge with Belle and the rose. Belle manages to escape from Xaldin's clutches with the rose, and Xaldin is then killed by Beast, Sora, Donald and Goofy. Belle gives Beast the rose but he is more relieved that she wasn't hurt. Beast then bids a grateful farewell to Sora, and returns to a normal life with Belle, until the spell is finally broken and Beast turns back into a human {{at the end of}} the game (a scene witnessed during the game's credits following completion). Beast's Limit attack for Kingdom Hearts II is Twin Howl, where he and Sora violently roar together and slash at enemies furiously.|$|E

25|$|The Allied “Grand Offensive”, {{planned by}} Foch and Haig, now began, the most {{important}} attack being that on the Hindenburg Line. Haig spent 26 September touring senior British Headquarters, contrasting Rawlinson’s optimism with Byng’s caution, and – at Monash’s request – giving a short <b>pep</b> <b>talk</b> and shaking hands with senior officers of the Australian Corps. On that day the Franco-American attack began in the Meuse-Argonne, then on 27 September British First and Third Armies attacked. First Army, which included the Canadian Corps, had to cross three trench systems and the Canal du Nord (dry but 100 feet wide), pinning many German reserves in five days of hard fighting and in due course penetrating 6 miles over a 12 mile front and taking 10,000 prisoners. On 28 September the Flanders Army Group (GAF) attacked in Flanders, eventually advancing six miles and almost reaching Roulers, which had been the immediate objective of the Third Ypres Offensive the previous autumn. On 29 September Fourth Army attacked, including the famous crossing of the St Quentin Canal (35 feet wide and 6 feet deep) by 46th Division, part of IX Corps, the men using lifebelts taken from Channel Ferries, after a mustard gas bombardment. Fourth Army was attacking forces of roughly equal strength, with the Australians (including the US 27th and 30th Divisions) covered by 1,488 guns and massed Vickers Guns. Rawlinson’s artillery density was equal only to that of 1 July 1916 but infantry had more organic firepower now. There were conflicting reports {{as to whether the}} US II Corps had captured the crossing over Bellincourt Tunnel (where the canal disappeared underground) – when asked for guidance by Monash, Haig ordered that his own attack must proceed as planned, even if American troops were killed by friendly fire. A cavalry brigade commanded by Haig’s cousin, Brigadier-General Neil Haig, was briefly committed to dismount and fight as infantry. By early October Fourth Army was through the Beaurevoir (German Reserve) Line and into open country. In late September Bulgaria sought an armistice, which also contributed to Ludendorff wanting an end to the war.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to Michael Buffer, the American boxing promoter Don King is featured prominently in [...] "Damien" [...] as Satan's promoter.

[...] Nancy Kerrigan, the Olympic figure skater attacked on orders of fellow skater Tonya Harding at the 1994 Winter Olympics, is referred to in a <b>pep</b> <b>talk</b> Stan gives Jesus. Stan wrongfully claims Kerrigan won the gold medal until Kyle reminds him she won the silver; Parker said this was done because he felt the perception of Kerrigan was extremely high among Americans considering she only actually achieved second place.

Green was surprised that Torres was not given a <b>pep</b> <b>talk</b> by either Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) or Chakotay in the final scene.
