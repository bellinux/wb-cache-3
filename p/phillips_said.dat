When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E
5|$|The {{group were}} {{surprised}} to see how small and technically basic the studio was, with only one microphone in {{the centre of the}} room. Phillips demanded that they pay for the recording before they set up the equipment, so each member paid 3 shillings and 6 pence, but he then asked for an extra surcharge (£1) {{to cover the cost of}} transferring the tape recording to acetate disc. As this was too expensive, <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> that for a cut-rate price they would not be taped first, but record directly to vinyl.|$|E

In subsequent recordings, these major modifications to the existing material became a normal procedure for Presley who took over the role of producer, although Sholes was still credited.

500|$|Phillips {{claimed the}} Dexter staff {{did not know}} how the finale would {{conclude}} until late in the season, but <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> Rita's death began to feel inevitable as the story evolved. [...] However, Julie Benz said she had been told John Lithgow knew about it {{from the beginning of the}} season. <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> the staff felt obligated to do more than simply kill the Trinity Killer in the final episode, especially because he felt the death of the third season antagonist (played by Jimmy Smits) was not handled [...] "as well as we could have". The writers discussed the idea of having Debra find out about Dexter's secret life, but it was decided they could not anticipate how drastically the series would be changed by that revelation. Benz heard rumors from David Zayas that her character would be killed in the episode, but she was not officially notified until late September, when the producers held a meeting with her the day before the season finale script was distributed to the cast. She said, [...] "It was a tough meeting. In a bizarre way, it felt like a scene from Defending Your Life." [...] Benz was unhappy about the news but she handled it professionally. Benz described the death scene as [...] "very poetic".|$|E

[...] The main goal was to fix the drainage of the terrace, which has leaked since the 1930s, and renovate the access steps.

[...] Mantle has said of his role: It is the job I've enjoyed doing {{more than anything else}} on TV. I have the greatest memories of beautiful, halcyon days-out filming on location and we had such a great, fun crew working on the show. We still get together once a year. Not just the cast but also the directors, producer, props guys, it's like a family! I think the key to part of the series' success was that this great camaraderie came across on screen.|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot was}} {{considered}} {{to have a good}} chance of being picked up, but ultimately the CW passed on the show. Discussing the excitement surrounding the project, Lou Diamond <b>Phillips</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The funny thing about the Aquaman project is that there's so much buzz about it already. Which is amazing, I mean you don't usually get that with a pilot, because they're sort of sight unseen." [...] There were reports of two WB pilots in contention for the new CW network, one being Aquaman, which was a frontrunner. On May 18, 2006, when The CW announced its fall lineup Aquaman was not on the list. Dawn Ostroff, The CW's president of entertainment, stated that it was still a midseason contender.|$|E

500|$|Haitian-American {{musician}} Wyclef Jean {{also serves}} as a producer. In addition, Wyclef Jean sings the first line of the second chorus in Haitian Creole. Richie said new artists were selected for the song so the song could be aimed at a new audience, commenting, [...] "We have a familiar song that kids learn in school. Why not bring in Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers and let them address the issues?" [...] adding that [...] "It was designed so that we wouldn't have any of the originals there, so that we could pass on the baton to the next generation". <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> that the producers received 80 percent of the people they wanted as recording artists for the song. In addition to Jean, Haitian actor Jimmy Jean-Louis, most famous for playing The Haitian on Heroes, appears in the chorus.|$|E
500|$|The writers planned {{from the}} pilot episode to {{eventually}} kill Doakes off the show. Executive producer Clyde <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> that Doakes [...] "always had a shelf life because of the collision course [...] ", while executive producer Sara Colleton believed it would be unrealistic to keep Doakes on for a third season without having him discover that Dexter is a murderer. Rosenberg said that risks {{had to be taken}} on the show, and Doakes was [...] "too good to not kill". The character was killed to prevent recycling of used ideas, so that the writers would [...] "stay aggressive and on top of it rather than repeat ourselves", according to Phillips. Erik King, who plays Doakes, mentioned the difficulty in killing Doakes off the show because Dexter could not murder an innocent man, and so Lila was Doakes' killer.|$|E
500|$|Dexters writing staff began {{meeting in}} March 2008 to {{brainstorm}} {{ideas for the}} third season's storylines. Writer Clyde <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> that, when the writers decided to open season 3 with the revelation of Rita's pregnancy, [...] "we were thinking about how it would affect Dexter psychologically and emotionally to create a life when he {{has spent most of}} his adult life taking lives." [...] They chose to introduce Miguel as a new character with the intention for his and Dexter's relationship to be [...] "the central arc of the season", according to Hall. Smits was the only actor who was considered for the role of Miguel. Smits was not initially interested in joining the cast, but after Phillips explained Miguel's dark side to him, Smits accepted the job offer because it was an opportunity to play a character dissimilar to any he had played before. He said, [...] "They promised upfront that this was really going to challenge me, that it would be stuff that I haven't done before, and they've really given me a shot. They've delivered the goods." [...] In regard to Dexter's abandonment of Harry's Code, Hall said that [...] "That need to rebel is a real engine for what unfolds this season." [...] Smits was hired to appear in ten of the season's twelve episodes. When asked at the beginning of the second season whether there was any possibility of Dexter killing an innocent person, show runner Daniel Cerone said that by not doing so, they were [...] "protecting the character". He thought that it was [...] "very important for the show that he does kill people who deserve it". <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "We don't want him knowingly killing somebody who doesn't deserve it out of impulse or something, but we have explored the notion of his having killed someone without properly vetting that person and perhaps making a mistake." ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{because of}} the devastation caused in Haiti, these plans were postponed. <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> that Jones had called Lionel and said, [...] "this is what this song is written for, as a {{fundraising}} vehicle for causes, tragedies, catastrophes like this. Why don't we take over the process, call our friends, and actually do this?" [...] Lionel understood the urgency of Haiti, and in January 2010, {{it was agreed that}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] would be re-recorded to help benefit Haiti, similar to how the original recording helped famine relief in Africa. Richie commented, [...] "Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a hit record to make someone decide to save a life. I want this song to be the battle cry again. Every once in a while, you have to wake the world up. We slept right through Katrina. If we are not a socially aware culture, we're going to fail." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive Producer Sara Colleton {{said it was}} {{difficult}} to kill off a long-standing character, but they felt [...] "this is where Dexter needed to be taken". She also felt the motives for Arthur killing Rita were deliberately made to be open to various interpretations, including that Arthur may have killed her [...] "in a bizarre way to trigger Dexter to deal with who he really is".s Season 5 Jump Ahead in Time? |work=TV Guide |date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 20, 2009}} When asked whether Arthur told Rita about Dexter's secret life before killing her, <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> the answer had not been determined because the fifth season was not yet planned, but he added, [...] "I would think that he did not tell her". Michael C. Hall called the ending a [...] "really bold stroke" [...] that would reset the stage of the series just as the Dexter Morgan character began to feel he could live with an emotional connection to his wife and family. Hall also said of the ending, [...] "More than anything I felt for the audience. I think {{this is the kind of}} thing that's really going to tie people in knots." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{said that}} there were three {{justifications}} for the immunity given in the caselaw and in argument. [...] Firstly, there was the [...] "chilling effect" [...] of such claims, making witnesses reluctant to give frank evidence or to provide expert evidence at all; secondly, the risk that an expert witness would be reluctant to comply with his paramount duty to the court if to do so involved giving evidence contrary to his client's interest with a risk of being sued for doing so. Thirdly, it was [...] "undesirable" [...] that a court hearing a claim for negligence against an expert witness should have to decide whether the court that decided the claim in which the expert gave evidence reached the correct decision. [...] This argument was not {{at the forefront of the}} defendant's arguments, but was one that Lord <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> should not be wholly discounted. He noted that a claim based on an alleged wrongful conviction as the result of an expert's negligence would be struck out as an abuse of process unless the conviction had been overturned, under the rule in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police.|$|E

500|$|The {{title was}} not {{shown at the}} 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) with the {{explanation}} {{that the company had}} spent the year [...] "rebuilding the technology", but a tie-in movie was mentioned as in production and a Saints Row 3 announcement was expected at the December Spike VGAs. Saints Row: The Third was finally announced officially in March 2011. The team wanted to include many different features and items, so scoping the final product became an issue. They laid out their ideas on a schedule and began to cut until over [...] "4000 man-days of scheduled work" [...] were removed, including features such as free-running (called [...] "freegunning") and a cover system. Competitive multiplayer was removed due to its lack of popularity in the previous series entries. In retrospect, <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> he wanted to remove more. The studio borrowed people {{from other parts of the}} company to finish the project. Writer Drew Holmes expressed the difficulty in determining what was too risqué for the game. In keeping with series advertising, Saints Row: The Third included a porn star, Sasha Grey, in the production as a character voice. Other celebrity voice actors include Hulk Hogan and Daniel Dae Kim.|$|E
500|$|Lord <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} appeal raised the [...] "narrow issue" [...] of whether [...] "the act of {{preparing}} a joint witness statement {{is one in}} respect of which an expert witness enjoys immunity from suit", and the broader issue of whether [...] "public policy justifies conferring on an expert witness any immunity from liability in negligence {{in relation to the}} performance of his duties in that capacity." [...] He said that it was surprising that the immunity had simply been accepted in the past and never challenged. He noted that the immunity dated back to Cutler v Dixon in 1585, over 400 years ago, before English tort law developed the modern law of negligence. It was originally a complete protection for witnesses against claims for defamation, before developing to cover protection from other tort claims. [...] He noted that it was difficult to draw the line at present between expert assistance that was immune from claim and that which was not: it might be that the earlier advice was negligent, not the evidence given in court resiling from that earlier advice, even if it was the later developments about which the client complained.|$|E
500|$|Saints Row 2 design {{philosophy}} was to [...] "put everything ... into the game", which {{made for a}} disjointed title with varied tone. Design director Scott <b>Phillips</b> <b>said</b> the series' legacy of lightheartedness made the sequel's tone hard to define. The development team withstood a high turnover between the two releases, with only {{a fifth of the}} final 100-person team having worked on a title in the series before. Saints Row: The Third was in development by September 2008 as Saints Row 3. For its first six months of development, the team tested a choice-based adventure concept featuring an undercover agent infiltrating the Saints, which was dropped for not aligning with the spirit of the series. Now without a vision, the team made a [...] "tone video" [...] with film segments and songs that would define the new title. The final version featured bits from Bad Boys II, Shoot 'Em Up, Hot Fuzz, and Mötley Crüe's [...] "Kickstart My Heart". The team worked in this direction to find a personality for Saints Row: The Third, which it found in its signature [...] "dildo bat". The idea started as one-off mission-specific weapon and the artists ran with the concept. Their design mantra became [...] "Embrace the Crazy; Fun Trumps All".|$|E
