50|$|Drawings for Louisiana-based {{games are}} {{conducted}} at Lottery headquarters in downtown Baton Rouge. They are videotaped and {{conducted in a}} special room secured by alarms and motion detectors. Each drawing is conducted using one of two secure automated <b>drawing</b> <b>machines.</b> Automated <b>drawing</b> <b>machines</b> are stand-alone computers that are essentially random number generators that are completely separate from the system that generates tickets, so the number of winners and where the winning tickets were sold is not known until after the drawing has occurred.|$|R
5000|$|Each Henry <b>drawing</b> <b>machine</b> {{was based}} around an {{analogue}} bombsight computer {{in combination with}} other components which Henry happened to have acquired for his home-based workshop in Whalley Range, Manchester. (O'Hanrahan 2005) Each machine took up to six weeks to construct and each drawing from between two hours to two days to complete. The <b>drawing</b> <b>machines</b> relied upon an external electric power source to operate either one or two servo motors which powered the synchronisation of suspended drawing implement(s) acting upon either a stationary or moving drawing table. (O'Hanrahan 2005) With the first <b>drawing</b> <b>machine</b> Henry employed biros as the mark-making implement; however with the machines that followed he preferred to use Indian ink in technical tube pens, since these effects, in contrast to biro ink, do not risk fading upon prolonged exposure to sunlight.

The pointed/reduced {{end of the bar}} or coil, which is smaller than the die opening, is passed through the die where it enters a gripping device of the <b>drawing</b> <b>machine.</b> The <b>drawing</b> <b>machine</b> pulls or <b>draws</b> the remaining unreduced section of the bar or coil through the die. The die reduces the cross section of the original bar or coil, shapes the profile of the product and increases the length of the original product.|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a series of}} works called Machinic Trajectories, consisting of domestic devices appropriated as mechanical <b>drawing</b> <b>machines.</b> These are contextualized within the post-digital discourse, which integrates messy analog conditions into the digital realm. The role of eliciting and examining glitches for investigating a technology is pointed out. Glitches are defined as short-lived, unpremeditated aesthetic results of a failure; they are mostly known as digital phenomena, but I argue that the concept is equally applicable to the output of mechanical <b>machines.</b> Three <b>drawing</b> <b>machines</b> will be presented: The Opener, The Mixer and The Ventilator. In analyzing their drawings, emergent patterns consisting of unpremeditated visual artifacts will be identified and connected to irregularities of the specific technologies. Several other artists who work with mechanical and robotic <b>drawing</b> <b>machines</b> are introduced, to situate the presented works and reflections in a larger context of practice and to investigate how glitch concepts are applicable to such mechanical systems.

The current developments mainly concern the wire last drawing operation: after a patenting treatment several reduction passes are performed on a slip-type multipass <b>drawing</b> <b>machine.</b> This paper focuses on modeling this multipass drawing process: a constitutive law based on the wire microstructure evolutions is created, a mechanical study is performed, a set of experiments which enables determining the process friction coefficients is suggested and finally the related analytical model is introduced.
