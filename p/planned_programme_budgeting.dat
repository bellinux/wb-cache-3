40|$|New {{political}} and social conditions in Poland make it necessary {{to take a new}} apporach to the structure, organization and functioning of planning. It seems that one of possible approaches in this respect is the conception of integrated territorial planning, comprising the totality of activities connected with the elaboration of development plans as well as with planning policy and economy in a given territory. Organizational structures should direct 'their attention at studies and analyses, programmes and conceptions as well as at executive and control activities. Of particular attention {{from the point of view}} of the requirements of the plan should be: the needs of the population and the possibilities of meeting them, natural environment as a subsystem of biophysical conditions of human existance and as a limiting factor for many planning projects, socio-eccnomic environment as a subsystem of psychosocial and material conditions of human life and activity, as well as spatial behaviours of economic units and the population. The planning process should be the analytic and creative sequence, the model of which may be found in J. B. Mc Loughlin's conception. However, the implementation of this process will be possible only if the efficient organizational structure is created. In this context, the question of well qualified and competent staff seems to be the priority. The implementation of the said planning system should bring positive effects in the form of real, good, socially advantageous and economically efficient <b>plans,</b> <b>programmes,</b> <b>budgets,</b> studies, analyses, etc., leading to the development of urban and rural areas along the expectations of the populationDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|R

40|$|Advocacy around mass {{treatment}} {{for the elimination of}} selected Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) has typically put the cost per person treated at less than US$ 0. 50. Whilst useful for advocacy, the focus on a single number misrepresents the complexity of delivering "free" donated medicines to about a billion people across the world. We perform a literature review and meta-regression of the cost per person per round of {{mass treatment}} against NTDs. We develop a web-based software application ([URL] to calculate setting-specific unit costs against which <b>programme</b> <b>budgets</b> and expenditures or results-based pay-outs can be benchmarked. We reviewed costing studies of mass {{treatment for the}} control, elimination or eradication of lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, onchocerciasis, trachoma and yaws. These are the main 6 NTDs for which mass treatment is recommended. We extracted financial and economic unit costs, adjusted to a standard definition and base year. We regressed unit costs on the number of people treated and other explanatory variables. Regression results were used to "predict" country-specific unit cost benchmarks. We reviewed 56 costing studies and included in the meta-regression 34 studies from 23 countries and 91 sites. Unit costs were found to be very sensitive to economies of scale, and the decision of whether or not to use local volunteers. Financial unit costs are expected to be less than 2015 US$ 0. 50 in most countries for programmes that treat 100 thousand people or more. However, for smaller programmes, including those in the "last mile", or those that cannot rely on local volunteers, both economic and financial unit costs are expected to be higher. The available evidence confirms that mass treatment offers a low cost public health intervention on the path towards universal health coverage. However, more costing studies focussed on elimination are needed. Unit cost benchmarks can help in monitoring value for money in <b>programme</b> <b>plans,</b> <b>budgets</b> and accounts, or in setting a reasonable pay-out for results-based financing mechanisms...|$|R

Methods Recorded semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 NHS dental decision-makers (mixed clinical and finance backgrounds) predominantly across Primary Care Trusts in England. Data were analysed using qualitative methods and the constant comparative approach. Results Participants were generally involved with contracting rather than commissioning new dental services at the time of interview. It was unclear how oral health needs assessments would guide future resource shifts and how commissioners would ensure the efficient use of finite resources. Whilst many participants thought that economic approaches would assist their commissioning decisions, few participants were aware of <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and marginal analysis as an alternative economics-based approach. Conclusions An assessment {{of the extent to which}} finite resources actually maximise the oral health of local populations is timely. Pragmatic economic approaches such as <b>programme</b> <b>budgeting</b> and marginal analysis may offer a framework to guide decision-makers through commissioning and the stages which lie beyond oral health needs assessments.
