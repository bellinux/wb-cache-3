5000|$|During {{construction}} a large gravel filled {{hole was}} discovered in the centre channel or [...] "gullet" [...] of the river bed. This gullet which was 50 ft (4.6 m) deep and varied in width from 50 to 100 ft (9.3 m) was dug out and filled {{with a mix of}} pozzolana (fly ash) and cement under the dam while under the powerhouse <b>Prepakt</b> <b>concrete</b> was used as this reduced demand on the batching plant which was fully occupied supplying concrete for the dam blocks. A total of 700,000 cubic yards (535,188 m3) of concrete were used {{in the construction of the}} dam and spillway consuming 600,000 cubic yards (458,733 m3). The cement was sourced from Millburn's Bankside plant at Dunedin while the aggregate was obtained from the Clutha River at Commissioner's Flat. Water came from the river.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Three matters {{discussed}} in the main report on {{the investigation of the}} suitability of <b>Prepakt</b> <b>concrete</b> for mass and reinforced concrete structures, issued in October 1951, required further study. These matters are (a) the properties of Alfesil, (b) the permeability of <b>Prepakt</b> <b>concrete,</b> and (c) the resistance of <b>Prepakt</b> <b>concrete</b> to natural weathering...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{investigation}} reported herein was to develop data on the suitability of <b>Prepakt</b> <b>concrete</b> for mass concrete dams and for reinforced concrete construction. <b>Prepakt</b> <b>concrete</b> is made by packing the forms with coarse aggregate and then pumping in a cement base intrusion mixture (grout) to fill the voids...|$|E
