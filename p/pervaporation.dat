25|$|Membranes {{can also}} be used to {{separate}} ethanol and water.

25|$|Other {{products}} fabricated {{with this}} process include various ceramic membranes for microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, <b>pervaporation</b> and reverse osmosis.

In all membrane methods, the membrane separates the fluid passing through it into a permeate (that which passes through) and a retentate (that which is left behind). When the membrane is chosen so that is it more permeable to one constituent than another, then the permeate will be richer in that first constituent than the retentate.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} make ABE {{fermentation}} profitable, many in-situ product recovery systems have been developed. These include gas stripping, <b>pervaporation,</b> membrane extraction, adsorption, and reverse osmosis. Green Biologics Ltd has implemented this at an industrial scale.|$|E
50|$|Membranes {{are used}} with {{pressure}} as the driving processes in membrane filtration of solutes and in reverse osmosis.

5000|$|The term <b>pervaporation</b> {{is derived}} from the two steps of the process: (a) {{permeation}} through the membrane by the permeate, then (b) its evaporation into the vapor phase.

50|$|Membrane {{separation}} processes have a {{very important}} role in the separation industry. Nevertheless, they were not considered technically important until the mid-1970s. Membrane separation processes differ based on separation mechanisms and size of the separated particles. The widely used membrane processes include microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, electrolysis, dialysis, electrodialysis, gas separation, vapor permeation, <b>pervaporation,</b> membrane distillation, and membrane contactors. All processes except for <b>pervaporation</b> involve no phase change. All processes except (electro)dialysis are pressure driven. Microfltration and ultrafiltration is widely used in food and beverage processing (beer microfiltration, apple juice ultrafiltration), biotechnological applications and pharmaceutical industry (antibiotic production, protein purification), water purification and wastewater treatment, the microelectronics industry, and others. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes are mainly used for water purification purposes. Dense membranes are utilized for gas separations (removal of CO2 from natural gas, separating N2 from air, organic vapor removal from air or a nitrogen stream) and sometimes in membrane distillation. The later process helps in the separation of azeotropic compositions reducing the costs of distillation processes.|$|E

50|$|Hydrophilic {{membranes}} {{are more}} widely available. The commercially most successful <b>pervaporation</b> membrane system {{to date is}} based on polyvinyl alcohol. More recently also membranes based on polyimide have become available. To overcome the intrinsic disadvantages of polymeric membrane systems ceramic membranes have been developed over the last decade. These ceramic membranes consist of nanoporous layers {{on top of a}} macroporous support. The pores must be large enough to let water molecules pass through and retain any other solvents that have a larger molecular size such as ethanol. As a result, a molecular sieve with a pore size of about 4 Å is obtained. The most widely available member of this class of membranes is that based on zeolite A.|$|E

5000|$|In {{membrane}} {{science and}} technology, concentration polarization {{refers to the}} emergence of concentration gradients at a membrane/solution interface resulted from selective transfer of some species through the membrane under the effect of transmembrane driving forces. Generally, the cause of concentration polarization is the ability of a membrane to transport some species more readily than the other(s) (which is the membrane permselectivity): the retained species are concentrated at the upstream membrane surface while the concentration of transported species decreases. Thus, concentration polarization phenomenon is inherent to all types of membrane separation processes. In the cases of gas separations, <b>pervaporation,</b> membrane distillation, reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration separations, the concentration profile has a higher level of solute nearest to the upstream membrane surface compared with the more or less well mixed bulk fluid far from the membrane surface. In the case of dialysis and electrodialysis, the concentrations of selectively transported dissolved species are reduced at the upstream membrane surface compared to the bulk solution. The emergence of concentration gradients is illustrated in Figs. 1a and 1b. Fig. 1a shows the concentration profile near and within a membrane when an external driving force is just applied to an initially equilibrium system. Concentration gradients have not yet formed. If the membrane is selectively permeable to species 1, its flux (...) within the membrane is higher than that in the solution (...) [...] Higher flux in the membrane causes a decrease in the concentration at the upstream membrane surface (...) and an increase at the downstream surface (...) , Fig. 1b. Thus, the upstream solution becomes depleted and the downstream solution becomes enriched in regard to species 1. The concentration gradients cause additional diffusion fluxes, which contribute to an increase of the total flux in the solutions and to a decrease of the flux in the membrane. As a result, the system reaches a steady state where [...] The greater the external force applied, the lower [...] In electrodialysis, when [...] becomes much lower than the bulk concentration, the resistance of the depleted solution becomes quite elevated. The current density related to this state is known as the limiting current density.|$|E

Water-alcohol mixture <b>pervaporation</b> was investigated using a <b>pervaporation</b> cell and hy-drophobic membranes.

Compared to vacuum <b>pervaporation,</b> on which many researchers have focused, sweep gas <b>pervaporation</b> has received little attention. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse opportunities for integrating and optimising both process layouts for the treatment of wastewater. The focus was on hollow fibre modules. Two module configurations of hollow fibre modules were considered: (1) shell-side and (2) tube-side feed flow. An advanced simulation program based on a phenomenological/semi-empirical model was used. The influence of (1) process parameters such as permeate pressure and the size of the sweep stream per module, and of (2) module design parameters such as void fraction or module configuration was determined for two model substances pyridine and phenol. Based on the simulations, guidelines for the optimisation of <b>pervaporation</b> are presented. These include the observation that for vacuum <b>pervaporation</b> shell-side feed flow is superior, whilst for sweep gas <b>pervaporation</b> tube-side feed flow should be selected. In the former case and for a given feed rate per module, the void fraction within the module should be selected as low as possible to reduce the effect of concentration polarisation. This approach is, however, limited by the pressure resistance of packed fibres causing an increasing pressure gradient on the feed side. For hydrophobic <b>pervaporation</b> of wastewater, sweep gas <b>pervaporation</b> should be combined with a moderate vacuum (of around 0. 1 bar) to improve the <b>pervaporation</b> performance; the performance at atmospheric pressure for the conditions selected leads to excessive membrane areas.
