5|$|Introduction {{of these}} quagga-like zebras could be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive</b> {{restoration}} program including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical {{times in a}} mutually beneficial association, could be kept together {{in areas where the}} indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.|$|E

25|$|According to the OECD, Finland's {{job market}} is the least {{flexible}} of the Nordic countries. Finland increased job market regulation in the 1970s to provide stability to manufacturers. In contrast, during the 1990s, Denmark liberalised its job market, Sweden moved to more decentralised contracts, whereas Finnish trade unions blocked many reforms. Many professions have legally recognized industry-wide contracts that lay down common terms of employment including seniority levels, holiday entitlements, and salary levels, usually as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Comprehensive</b> Income Policy Agreement. Those who favor less centralized labor market policies consider these agreements bureaucratic, inflexible, and along with tax rates, a key contributor to unemployment and distorted prices. Centralized agreements may hinder structural change as there are fewer incentives to acquire better skills, although Finland already enjoys {{one of the highest}} skill-levels in the world.|$|E
25|$|General Victor-Constant Michel, Vice-President of the Conseil supérieur de la guerre in 1910, {{was more}} {{convinced}} than Lacrois of a German move through Belgium, {{because of the}} obstacle of French defences in Lorraine, the terrain in eastern Belgium and German railway building. Michel thought that the Germans would make their main effort in central Belgium and that covering a longer front would need the organisation of French reserve units and integration with the active army. The council rejected his view in 1911, which caused Michel to resign as he considered that deployment from Belfort to Mézières and an offensive towards Antwerp, Brussels and Namur as the only possible way to respond. Joseph Joffre was eventually appointed and the functions of Vice-President of the Council and Chief of Staff of the army were combined. In October 1911, a strategic assessment was delivered as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive</b> review conducted from 1911–1912.|$|E

In this modeling, a fit between individual, strategy, structure and environment is key to attain better performance in terms of, for example, efficiency or profitability. Strategy is assumed to be the linking pin between the entrepreneur’s (or his or her venture’s) strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunities and threats in the environment. In line with this contingency approach, the authors utilize a multi-disciplinary theoretical lens in combination with analysis techniques that allow for the identification of fits (and misfits), such as the analysis of conditional processes or dynamic multi-level QCA fit analysis...|$|R

Likewise, the program’s hiring subsidy is similar to the social security break for new employees introduced in the 2015 Italian draft budgetary plan: there are high expectations for this national subsidy boosting labor demand in 2015.41 Overall, although the differences between the regional hiring subsidy analyzed here and the national subsidy make direct comparison difficult, the results reported in this study can nevertheless offer some guidance to infer the effects of these future interventions. 42 [...]...|$|R
