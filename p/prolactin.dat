5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} and the periventricular {{nucleus of the}} {{hypothalamus}} have dopamine neurons that form an important projection—the tuberoinfundibular pathway which goes to the pituitary gland, where it influences the secretion of the hormone <b>prolactin.</b> Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of <b>prolactin</b> from the anterior pituitary gland. Dopamine produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the pituitary gland. The <b>prolactin</b> cells that produce <b>prolactin,</b> {{in the absence of}} dopamine, secrete <b>prolactin</b> continuously; dopamine inhibits this secretion. In the context of regulating <b>prolactin</b> secretion, dopamine is occasionally called prolactin-inhibiting factor, prolactin-inhibiting hormone, or prolactostatin.|$|E
5|$|A {{high blood}} <b>prolactin</b> level {{within the first}} 20 minutes {{following}} a seizure {{may be useful to}} help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Serum <b>prolactin</b> level is less useful for detecting focal seizures. If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum <b>prolactin</b> does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope. It is not recommended as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Prolactin</b> (PRL) {{plays a role}} in breastfeeding, and {{inability}} to breastfeed may point at abnormally low <b>prolactin</b> levels.|$|E
5|$|Unless the {{pituitary}} {{damage is}} being {{caused by a}} tumor that overproduces a particular hormone, it {{is the lack of}} pituitary hormones that leads to the symptoms described above, and an excess of a particular hormone would indicate the presence of a tumor. The exception to this rule is prolactin: if a tumor compresses the pituitary stalk, a decreased blood supply means that the lactotrope cells, which produce <b>prolactin,</b> are not receiving dopamine and therefore produce excess <b>prolactin.</b> Hence, mild elevations in <b>prolactin</b> are attributed to stalk compression. Very high <b>prolactin</b> levels, though, point more strongly towards a prolactinoma (prolactin-secreting tumor).|$|E
5|$|The {{pigmentation}} of hair {{is controlled}} by the hormone <b>prolactin</b> and colour genetics.|$|E
5|$|For TSH, basal {{measurements}} are usually sufficient, {{as well as}} measurements of thyroxine {{to ensure that the}} pituitary is not simply suppressing TSH production in response to hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland). A stimulation test with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is not regarded as useful. <b>Prolactin</b> can be measured by basal level, and is required for the interpretation of LH and FSH results in addition to the confirmation of hypopituitarism or diagnosis of a prolactin-secreting tumor.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably <b>prolactin,</b> growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the hormones}} in the {{anterior}} pituitary are {{each part of}} an axis that is regulated by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes a number of releasing hormones, often according to a circadian rhythm, into blood vessels that supply the anterior pituitary; {{most of these are}} stimulatory (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone and growth hormone-releasing hormone), apart from dopamine, which suppresses <b>prolactin</b> production. In response to the releasing hormone rate, the anterior pituitary produces its hormones (TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, GH) which in turn stimulate effector hormone glands in the body, while <b>prolactin</b> (PRL) acts directly on the breast gland. Once the effector glands produce sufficient hormones (thyroxine, cortisol, estradiol or testosterone and IGF-1), both the hypothalamus and the pituitary cells sense their abundance and reduce their secretion of stimulating hormones. The hormones of the posterior pituitary are produced in the hypothalamus and are carried by nerve endings to the posterior lobe; their feedback system is therefore located in the hypothalamus, but damage to the nerve endings would still lead to a deficiency in hormone release.|$|E
5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of <b>prolactin</b> in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism is made on blood tests. Two types of blood tests {{are used to}} confirm {{the presence of a}} hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and dynamic tests, where blood tests are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, <b>prolactin,</b> TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum <b>prolactin</b> levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|In newts and salamanders, {{metamorphosis}} is {{less dramatic}} than in frogs. This {{is because the}} larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. Their lungs are functional early, but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure. Salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land. Adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer, and a land phase in winter. For adaptation to a water phase, <b>prolactin</b> is the required hormone, and for adaptation to the land phase, thyroxine. External gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Most {{amphibians}} {{go through}} metamorphosis, {{a process of}} significant morphological change after birth. In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and <b>prolactin,</b> which counteracts thyroxine's effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues. Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances. For this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth, whisker-like skin extensions or fins. They also make use of a sensory lateral line organ {{similar to that of}} fish. After metamorphosis, these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death, called apoptosis. The variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide, with many discoveries still being made.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases (60–80%) are not precipitated by a particular cause. A quarter {{has a history of}} high blood pressure, but this is a common problem in the general population, and {{it is not clear whether}} it significantly increase the risk of apoplexy. A number of cases has been reported in association with particular conditions and situations; it is uncertain whether these were in fact causative. Amongst reported associations are surgery (especially coronary artery bypass graft, where there are significant fluctuations in the blood pressure), disturbances in blood coagulation or medication that inhibits coagulation, radiation therapy to the pituitary, traumatic brain injury, pregnancy (during which the pituitary enlarges) and treatment with estrogens. Hormonal stimulation tests of the pituitary have been reported to provoke episodes. Treatment of prolactinomas (pituitary adenomas that secrete <b>prolactin)</b> with dopamine agonist drugs, as well as withdrawal of such treatment, has been reported to precipitate apoplexy.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{develops in}} {{the third week of}} embryogenesis from interactions between the diencephalon part of the brain and the nasal cavity. The brain cells secrete FGF-8, Wnt5a and BMP-4, and the oral cavity BMP-2. Together, these cellular signals stimulate a group of cells from the oral cavity to form Rathke's pouch, which becomes independent of the nasal cavity and develops into the anterior pituitary; this process includes the suppression of production of a protein called Sonic hedgehog by the cells of Rathke's pouch. The cells then differentiate further into the various hormone-producing cells of the pituitary. This requires particular transcription factors that induce the expression of particular genes. Some of these transcription factors {{have been found to be}} deficient in some forms of rare combined pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD) in childhood. These are HESX1, PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4, TBX19, SOX2 and SOX3. Each transcription factor acts in particular groups of cells. Therefore, various genetic mutations are associated with specific hormone deficiencies. For instance, POU1F1 (also known as Pit-1) mutations cause specific deficiencies in growth hormone, <b>prolactin</b> and TSH. In addition to the pituitary, some of the transcription factors are also required for the development of other organs; some of these mutations are therefore also associated with specific birth defects.|$|E
25|$|General {{guidelines}} for diagnosing <b>prolactin</b> excess (hyperprolactinemia) define the upper threshold of normal <b>prolactin</b> at 25µg/L {{for women and}} 20µg/L for men. Similarly, {{guidelines for}} diagnosing <b>prolactin</b> deficiency (hypoprolactinemia) are defined as <b>prolactin</b> levels below 3µg/L in women and 5µg/L in men. However, different assays and methods for measuring <b>prolactin</b> are employed by different laboratories and as such the serum reference range for <b>prolactin</b> is often determined by the laboratory performing the measurement. Furthermore, <b>prolactin</b> levels also vary factors including age, sex, menstrual cycle stage and pregnancy. The circumstances surrounding a given <b>prolactin</b> measurement (assay, patient condition, etc.) must therefore be considered before the measurement can be accurately interpreted.|$|E
25|$|Human <b>prolactin</b> receptors are {{insensitive}} to mouse <b>prolactin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Prolactin</b> is {{available}} commercially {{for use in}} animals, but not in humans. It is used to stimulate lactation in animals. The biological half-life of <b>prolactin</b> in humans is around 15–20 minutes. The D2 receptor {{is involved in the}} regulation of <b>prolactin</b> secretion, and agonists of the receptor such as bromocriptine and cabergoline decrease <b>prolactin</b> levels while antagonists of the receptor such as domperidone, metoclopramide, haloperidol, risperidone, and sulpiride increase <b>prolactin</b> levels. D2 receptor antagonists like domperidone, metoclopramide, and sulpiride are used as galactogogues to increase prolatin secretion and induce lactation in humans.|$|E
25|$|In humans, <b>prolactin</b> is {{produced}} {{at least in}} the anterior pituitary, decidua, myometrium, breast, lymphocytes, leukocytes and prostate. A key regulator of <b>prolactin</b> production is estrogens that enhance growth of prolactin-producing cells and stimulate <b>prolactin</b> production directly, as well as suppressing dopamine.|$|E
25|$|The first International Reference Preparation (or IRP) {{of human}} <b>Prolactin</b> for Immunoassay was {{established}} in 1978 (75/504 1st IRP for human <b>Prolactin)</b> {{at a time when}} purified human <b>prolactin</b> was in short supply. Previous standards relied on <b>prolactin</b> from animal sources. Purified human <b>prolactin</b> was scarce, heterogeneous, unstable and difficult to characterize. A preparation labelled 81/541 was distributed by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization without official status and given the assigned value of 50 mIU/ampoule based on an earlier collaborative study. It was determined that this preparation behaved anomalously in certain immunoassays and was not suitable as an IS.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prolactin</b> follows diurnal and ovulatory cycles. <b>Prolactin</b> levels peak during REM {{sleep and}} in the early morning. Many mammals {{experience}} a seasonal cycle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prolactin</b> {{levels may}} be of some use in {{distinguishing}} epileptic seizures from psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. The serum <b>prolactin</b> level usually rises following an epileptic seizure.|$|E
25|$|Three {{different}} human pituitary extracts containing <b>prolactin</b> {{were subsequently}} obtained as candidates for an IS. These were distributed into ampoules coded 83/562, 83/573 and 84/500. Collaborative studies involving 20 different laboratories found little {{difference between these}} three preparations. 83/562 {{appeared to be the}} most stable. This preparation was largely free of dimers and polymers of <b>prolactin.</b> On the basis of these investigations 83/562 was established as the Second IS for human <b>Prolactin.</b> Once stocks of these ampoules were depleted, 84/500 was established as the Third IS for human <b>Prolactin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} chart {{illustrates the}} variations seen in normal <b>prolactin</b> measurements across different populations. <b>Prolactin</b> values {{were obtained from}} specific control groups of varying sizes using the IMMULITE assay.|$|E
25|$|Sucking on {{the nipple}} offsets {{the fall in}} <b>prolactin</b> as the {{internal}} stimulus for them is removed. The sucking activates mechanoreceptors {{in and around the}} nipple. These signals are carried by nerve fibers through the spinal cord to the hypothalamus, where changes in the electrical activity of neurons that regulate the pituitary gland increase <b>prolactin</b> secretion. The suckling stimulus also triggers the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary gland, which triggers milk let-down: <b>Prolactin</b> controls milk production (lactogenesis) but not the milk-ejection reflex; the rise in <b>prolactin</b> fills the breast with milk in preparation for the next feed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prolactin</b> {{levels may}} be checked {{as part of}} a sex hormone workup, as {{elevated}} <b>prolactin</b> secretion can suppress the secretion of FSH and GnRH, leading to hypogonadism and sometimes causing erectile dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prolactin</b> receptors {{are present}} in the mammillary glands, ovaries, {{pituitary}} glands, heart, lung, thymus, spleen, liver, pancreas, kidney, adrenal gland, uterus, skeletal muscle, skin and areas of the central nervous system. When <b>prolactin</b> binds to the receptor, it causes it to dimerize with another <b>prolactin</b> receptor. This results in the activation of Janus kinase 2, a tyrosine kinase that initiates the JAK-STAT pathway. Activation also results in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Src kinase.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prolactin</b> – {{deficiency}} (childhood).|$|E
25|$|Elevated {{levels of}} <b>prolactin</b> {{decrease}} {{the levels of}} sex hormones — estrogen in women and testosterone in men. The effects of mildly elevated levels of <b>prolactin</b> are much more variable, in women, substantially increasing or decreasing estrogen levels.|$|E
25|$|During pregnancy, high {{circulating}} {{concentrations of}} estrogen and progesterone increase <b>prolactin</b> levels by 10- to 20-fold. Estrogen and progesterone inhibit the stimulatory effects of <b>prolactin</b> on milk production. The abrupt drop of estrogen and progesterone levels following delivery allow prolactin—which temporarily remains high—to induce lactation.|$|E
25|$|Other actions include {{contributing}} to pulmonary surfactant {{synthesis of the}} fetal lungs {{at the end of}} the pregnancy and immune tolerance of the fetus by the maternal organism during pregnancy. <b>Prolactin</b> delays hair regrowth in mice. <b>Prolactin</b> promotes neurogenesis in maternal and fetal brains.|$|E
25|$|Hypoprolactinemia, or serum <b>prolactin</b> deficiency, is {{associated}} with ovarian dysfunction in women, and arteriogenic erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, oligozoospermia, asthenospermia, hypofunction of seminal vesicles and hypoandrogenism in men. In one study, normal sperm characteristics were restored when <b>prolactin</b> levels were raised to normal values in hypoprolactinemic men.|$|E
25|$|Several {{variants}} {{and forms}} are known per species. Many fish have variants <b>prolactin</b> A and <b>prolactin</b> B. Most vertebrates including humans {{also have the}} closely related somatolactin. In humans, three smaller (4, 16 and 22 kDa) and several larger (so called big and big-big) variants exist.|$|E
25|$|Elevated <b>prolactin</b> {{concentrations}} {{have been}} observed in patients taking trazodone.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, <b>prolactin</b> is {{associated}} with milk production; in fish it {{is thought to be}} related to control of water and salt balance. <b>Prolactin</b> also acts in a cytokine-like manner and as an important regulator of the immune system. It has important cell cycle-related functions as a growth-, differentiating- and anti-apoptotic factor. As a growth factor, binding to cytokine-like receptors, it influences hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and is involved in the regulation of blood clotting through several pathways. The hormone acts in endocrine, autocrine and paracrine manner through the <b>prolactin</b> receptor and a large number of cytokine receptors.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} SSRIs, {{citalopram}} can cause {{an increase in}} serum <b>prolactin</b> level.|$|E
