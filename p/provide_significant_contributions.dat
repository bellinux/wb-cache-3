40|$|Changes in enzyme {{conformation}} {{are often}} accompanied by large changes in volume. Model compound studies suggest that these volume changes may derive from two sources: (i) "hydration density" effects due {{to changes in the}} exposure to solvent of protein groups which modify water density, and (ii) "structural" contributions arising from changes in the volume of the protein itself. An experimental approach was developed to test the validity of the predictions based on model compound studies for catalytic conformational changes.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} an Australian agribusiness supply chain, the Australian Beef Supply Chain. The definition of the Australian Beef Supply Chain is the chain or sequence of all activities from the breeding property to the domestic or overseas consumers. The beef sector in Australia is undergoing rapid change because of globalisation, a highly competitive beef market (local and export), quicker production cycle and delivery times and consequently reduced inventories, a general speed-up of {{the rate of change}} in the business environment, the trend toward more outsourcing of activities, and the rapid development of IT. In this business environment, advanced supply chain systems have the potential to <b>provide</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> to Australian beef industry performance.

Research in network and distributed systems security has <b>provided</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> for well-known security problems.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the formation of}} the sand waves generated by tide propagation, the stability of the flat sea bottom forced by tidal currents is often analyzed. Both quasi-steady and unsteady approaches are used. The quasi-steady approaches consider a steady current characterized by a slowly varying strength such that the time t is considered as a parameter in the equations describing the phenomenon. The unsteady approaches take into account the unsteadiness of the forcing flow assuming that the terms related to partial/partial t <b>provide</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> to the momentum and sediment balances. In the present paper, the accuracy of the two classes of approach is discussed along with the reliability of their predictions. The use of an unsteady approach appears to be necessary when the suspended sediment transport provides a significant contribution to the total load. A simple diagram is presented to evaluate the need of an unsteady approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of several major cases of persistent negative height anomalies over the extratropical central North Pacific and eastern North Atlantic regions was investigated. These events were manifested {{at the surface}} by the {{development of}} large-scale cyclonic circulations and, at upper levels, by the formation of anomalously intense zonal jets. The data for the analyses were obtained from the twice-daily NMC final analyses of Northern Hemisphere sea-level pressure as well as geopotential heights, winds, and temperatures at all standard levels from 1000 mb to 100 mb for the fourteen winter seasons from years 1963 - 1964 through 1976 - 1977. The results indicate that, in many cases of cyclogenesis, baroclinic processes are likely {{to play an important role}} in the initial developments. At later stages, barotropic processes also <b>provide</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> and play a role in the maintenance of the anomalies once they are established...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{taxonomy}} {{is fundamental}} to conservation efforts of bioresources. The units on which conservation is based are determined largely by species designation. Ambiguous identification of species may lead to erroneous conclusions, which may be more serious than {{lack of understanding of}} the population structure and status; for example, conclusions such as loss of genetic variability(e. g., by unwitting extinction of a species). In cetaceans (whales,dolphins andporpoises), morphological features are subtle and difficult to compare because of the rarity of specimens or widespread distributions. Identifying the geographical variants of recognized species of cetaceans is more cumbersome using the conventional approaches and in this context molecular genetics can <b>provide</b> <b>significant</b> <b>contributions</b> to taxonomic understanding of inter and intra-specific variations for conservation and management purposes. Similarly, in dugong,a critically endangered marine mammal, in order to devise adequate conservation andmanagement strategies for the species of concern, it is essential to study the population genetic characteristics of the species throughout the range of its distribution. DNA sequence analysis has become a powerful tool for conservation...|$|E
