5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his important work on {{conservation of energy}} in <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> he used those principles {{to explain why the}} oscillation dies away, that it is the resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz also noted that there was evidence of oscillation from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by electric shock but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E

5|$|The cagA gene {{codes for}} one of the major H. pylori {{virulence}} proteins. Bacterial strains with the cagA gene are associated with an ability to cause ulcers.
