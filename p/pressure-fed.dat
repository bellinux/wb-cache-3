25|$|Kestrel is a LOX/RP-1 <b>pressure-fed</b> rocket engine, and {{was used}} as the Falcon 1 rocket's second stage main engine. It is built around the same pintle {{architecture}} as SpaceX's Merlin engine but does not have a turbo-pump, and is fed only by tank pressure. Its nozzle is ablatively cooled in the chamber and throat, is also radiatively cooled, and is fabricated from a high strength niobium alloy.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a shoulder-wing monoplane {{powered by a}} 52kW (70hp) Gnome Gamma 7-cylinder rotary engine driving a two bladed propeller. The pilot and passenger were seated in side-by-side configuration: the control column was centrally mounted {{and there were two}} sets of rudder pedals, so that it could be flown from either seat. The shallow section rectangular fuselage tapered to a horizontal knife-edge at the tail, with the elongated triangular horizontal stabiliser mounted in the middle, its covering blending into that of the upper and lower fuselage surface. A semi-elliptical elevator was mounted on the trailing edge, and a triangular balanced rudder was mounted above the rear fuselage. Lateral control was effected by wing-warping, the wires leading to a single inverted V-strut cabane above the fuselage and a similar V strut beneath. Petrol was stored in three tanks: a pair of gravity tanks were located under the top decking in front of the cockpit, <b>pressure-fed</b> from a larger tank under the seats.|$|E
2500|$|Buran's {{equivalent}} of the Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System used GOX/LOX/Kerosene propellant, with lower toxicity and higher performance (a specific impulse of [...] using a turbopump system) than the Shuttle's <b>pressure-fed</b> monomethylhydrazine/dinitrogen tetroxide OMS engines.|$|E
2500|$|Camshaft {{bearings}} {{are similar}} to crankshaft main bearings, being <b>pressure-fed</b> with oil.

2500|$|... {{amortization}} of R and facility costs over {{mass production}} {{to the degree}} seen in more pedestrian manufacturing. Amongst liquid-fueled rockets, complexity can be influenced by how much hardware must be lightweight, like <b>pressure-fed</b> engines can have two orders of magnitude lesser part count than pump-fed engines but lead to more weight by needing greater tank pressure, most often used in just small maneuvering thrusters as a consequence.|$|E
2500|$|Rocket Racer - The EZ-Rocket program led to {{a second}} {{rocketplane}} design for the Rocket Racing League. [...] It was built on a Velocity SE airframe and later {{became known as the}} Mark-I X-Racer. [...] It was powered by an XCOR regeneratively cooled and pump-fed XR-4K14 rocket engine. [...] This rocket-powered aircraft flew several demonstration flights at the 2008 EAA AirVenture Oshkosh air show. [...] The total thrust for the single-engine Mark-I X-Racer has been variously reported as [...] to , approximately twice that of the EZ-Rocket initial prototype. [...] The engine uses <b>pressure-fed</b> LOX and pump-fed kerosene, a combination that allows the fuel to be stored in the airplane's wing tanks while avoiding potential complications with pumping liquid oxygen. [...] After flight testing of the X-Racer was completed in 2008, XCOR completed seven rocketplane flights in one day.|$|E

5000|$|The Orion Main Engine (OME) was a 7500-pound thrust, <b>pressure-fed,</b> regeneratively cooled, {{storable}} bi-propellant {{rocket engine}} {{to be made}} by Aerojet. The OME was an increased performance version of the 6000-pound thrust rocket engine used by the Space Shuttle for its Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS). The SM Reaction Control System (RCS), the spacecraft's maneuvering thrusters (originally based on the Apollo [...] "quad" [...] system, but resembling that used on Gemini), would also be <b>pressure-fed,</b> and would use the same propellants. NASA believed the SM RCS would be able to act as a backup for a trans-Earth injection (TEI) burn in case the main SM engine fails.|$|E

50|$|The <b>pressure-fed</b> {{engine is}} {{a class of}} rocket engine designs. A {{separate}} gas supply, usually helium, pressurizes the propellant tanks to force fuel and oxidizer to the combustion chamber.

5000|$|ICAO Annex 14, § 9.2.34 directs that: All {{rescue and}} fire {{fighting}} personnel shall be properly trained {{to perform their}} duties in an efficient manner and shall participate in live fire drills commensurate with the types of aircraft and type of rescue and fire fighting equipment in use at the aerodrome, including <b>pressure-fed</b> fuel fires.|$|E
50|$|Conventionally, rockets use {{pressurized}} {{reserves of}} an inert gas to 'backfill' propellant tanks, {{in order to}} maintain tank pressure as the tank voids. However, the proposed aerospike throttled thrust architecture uses autogenous <b>pressure-fed</b> methane/liquid oxygen propellant. Pressure is maintained by the propellant alone, thus removing the weight requirement, complexity and additional failure modes of inert gas reserves.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pressure-fed</b> engines have {{practical}} {{limits on}} propellant pressure, {{which in turn}} limits combustion chamber pressure. High pressure propellant tanks require thicker walls and stronger alloys which make the vehicle tanks heavier, thereby reducing performance and payload capacity. The lower stages of launch vehicles often use either solid fuel or pump-fed liquid fuel engines instead, where high pressure ratio nozzles are considered desirable.|$|E
50|$|The BT-4 is a <b>pressure-fed</b> liquid {{rocket engine}} {{designed}} and manufactured by IHI Aerospace of Japan.

It has also been used on the HTV and Cygnus automated cargo spacecraft.|$|E
