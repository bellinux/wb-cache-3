40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the frequency, persistence and succession sequence of six types of air mass {{during the period}} 1951 – 2010. The study, which relied on a calendar of air masses in southern Poland published by T. Niedźwiedź, concludes {{that there is no}} simple relationship between the persistence and the frequency of specific air masses in the region. The study found that there was a great variety in the persistence of specific types of air mass and that persistence depended more on the direction of air mass advection than on their frequency of occurrence. The study also failed to identify any strict overall rule of succession, as any air mass could follow after any other, but certain finer-grained patterns emerged. In winter and summer, arctic air (A) never followed directly after tropical air (T) or vice versa. Also, the most frequent succession sequence identified was from <b>Polar</b> <b>maritime</b> fresh <b>air</b> (mPf) to <b>Polar</b> <b>maritime</b> old and it accounted {{for the vast majority of}} successions from mPf into any other air mass (63 % annually and 76 % in summer) ...|$|R

2500|$|Each {{air mass}} type brings in {{different}} temperature and moisture properties. The continental polar air mass brings in cold and dry air from central Canada, traveling south across the region. The continental tropical air mass comes {{in from the}} Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, bringing in hot and dry air while moving north. The <b>maritime</b> tropical <b>air</b> mass comes from the southwest United States and Northern Mexico, and it tends to bring in warm and moist air, but sometimes the air that comes in is dry. The last air mass that affects this ecoregion is the <b>maritime</b> <b>polar</b> <b>air</b> mass. It comes in from the Pacific Ocean and moves east over the mountain regions. It brings in cool moist air that changes to warm dry air after moving over the mountains. These air masses cause the seasons to be very extreme and drastic. The winter time brings harsh and varied weather. The midsummer months bring in warm moist and dry air, depending on the area within the region and what air masses affect those areas.|$|R
40|$|Na podstawie kalendarza mas powietrznych w Polsce Południowej opracowanego przez T. Niedźwiedzia scharakteryzowano długotrwałość występowania 6 typów mas powietrznych w latach 1951 – 2009. Skoncentrowano się na średnim czasie utrzymywania i ciągach dni z masami powietrznymi w porach roku oraz trendach ich zmian wieloletnich. Średnia długotrwałość mas zmienia się od 1, 4 dnia (masa PP_m_c w lecie) do 4, 5 dnia (masa PP_k w zimie). Największą długotrwałością występowania, niezależnie od pory roku cechują się masy PP_k (maksymalnie do 30 dni), a najmniejszą masy PP_m i PP_m_c. Czas utrzymywania się nad Polską Południową mas zależy nie tylko od ich częstości, ale też od kierunku adwekcji. Istotny wzrost średniej długotrwałości cechuje masy PA w zimie. The {{duration}} of six types of air masses was identified in southern Poland {{over the period}} 1951 – 2009. A calendar of air masses developed by T. Niedźwiedź was used, and the six air masses included: arctic (PA), polar maritime fresh (PP_m), polar maritime old (PP_m_s), polar maritime warm (PP_m_c), polar continental (PP_k) and tropical air (PZ). The study determined the average {{duration of}} air masses per season {{and the frequency of}} sequences of days with individual air masses. Linear regression analysis was used to identify trends in the average duration. The duration of air masses investigated in southern Poland was found to be highly variable. The average duration varied in the range from 1. 4 days of the warm <b>polar</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>air</b> (PP_m_c) in summer to 4. 5 days of the polar continental air (PP_k) in winter. The largest number of air–mass spells ranged from one to three days. Polar continental air masses (PP_k) were found to account for the longest uniform air–mass spells regardless of the season (up to 30 days in autumn of 1951), whilst the polar maritime fresh (PP_m) and warm <b>polar</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>air</b> masses tended to last the shortest. The Advection vector determined air mass duration more than the frequency of occurrence. The highly stable easterly air circulation was found to promote long durations of uniform air masses over the area and produced longer periods dominated by PP_k air. In the long term, average durations followed a number of various trends, of which only the trend of to an increase in the average duration of arctic air in winter was statistically significant. This trend was a result of a growing frequency of occurrence of this air mass type...|$|E
40|$|Directional {{analysis}} {{has been used}} to study changes in the sub-polar climate of the mountainous and glacierised sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia (54 - 55 °S, 36 - 38 °W). Significantly for climate change studies, South Georgia lies in the Scotia Sea between polar and temperate latitudes, and approximately 1000 km northeast and downwind of the Antarctic Peninsula - one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth (Vaughan et al., 2001). South Georgia was chosen for directional analysis because its climate is substantially advected by predominantly westerly circulations, and because it has a long (since 1905) meteorological record from King Edward Point (KEP) on its eastern side. Additional shorter records from Bird Island at the northwest tip of South Georgia allow comparison between windward (Bird Island) and leeward (KEP) climate regimes. The variation of mountain barrier heights with direction from KEP allows climate changes to be studied under different amounts of orographic influence (from ~ 700 m to ~ 2200 m). Records of glacier advance and retreat provide further independent evidence of climate change for comparison with the meteorological record. Directional climate analysis is based on a series of monthly-mean pressure fields defining the orientation and strength of synoptic-scale air-mass advection over the Scotia Sea. These fields are used to define directional climatologies for six 30 ° sectors with bearings from 150 - 180 ° to 300 - 330 °; these sectors encompass 99 % of recorded months since 1905. The climatologies summarise the frequencies of air masses from each sector, and the accompanying temperatures and precipitation. The 6 sectors can be broadly associated with 4 air-mass types and source regions: (i) sectors 150 - 210 ° advect cold <b>polar</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>air</b> that originated over the Antarctic continent before passing over the Weddell Sea, (ii) sectors 210 - 270 ° advect warmer, more stable <b>polar</b> <b>maritime</b> <b>air</b> from the Bellingshausen Sea/Antarctic Peninsula region, (iii) sector 270 - 300 ° has warmer, drier returning polar maritime circulated from the Bellingshausen Sea and across the Andes, and (iv) sector 300 - 330 ° has warm, humid tropical maritime air from the South Atlantic High. Detailed climatologies are compared for 4 distinct time periods covering: glacier advance (1920 - 1951), glacier retreat (1951 - 82), the latest decade (2000 - 2009), and a reference period (1905 - 1982). The comparisons show how climate changes between periods are composed of alterations in (i) air-mass frequency from different sectors, and (ii) temperature and precipitation within sectors. The ability of directional analysis to explain climate-change processes is confirmed by comparing directional results for the periods of glacier advance and glacier retreat. Specifically, during the ‘advance’ period the air masses came 20 % more frequently from the 4 colder, southerly sectors and correspondingly less frequently from the 2 warmer, northerly sectors. Moreover, the temperature of air coming from each sector was 0. 1 - 0. 8 °C cooler than during the ‘retreat’ period. Further directional analysis will compare records from the latest decade with previous periods to investigate recent sub-polar climate change, and particularly any advected warming from the Antarctic Peninsula. Directional analysis and advection climatologies can be used to test climate model performance and to examine atmospheric processes under changing climates. Previous directional analyses in an upland region of northwest England have detected changes in its mid-latitude temperate climate that were masked by directionally unsorted data (Malby et al., 2007, Ferranti et al., 2009); the South Georgia study now shows how similar methods can give insights into sub-polar climate change...|$|E
40|$|Convective {{clouds and}} {{thunderstorms}} redistribute air pollutants vertically, and by altering the chemistry and radiative {{balance of the}} upper troposphere, these local actions can have global consequences. To study these effects, measurements of trace gases ozone, Os, carbon monoxide, CO, and odd nitrogen were made aboard the NCAR Sabreliner on 18 flights over the southern Great Plains during June 1985. To demonstrate chemical changes induced by vertical motions in the atmosphere and to facilitate comparison with computer model calculations, these data were categorized according to synoptic flow patterns. Part 1 of this two-part paper details the alternating pulses of <b>polar</b> and <b>maritime</b> <b>air</b> masses that dominate the vertical mixing in this region. In this paper, trace gas measurements are presented as altitude profiles (0 - 12 km) with statistical distributions of mixing ratios for each species in each flow pattern. The polar flow regime is characterized by northwesterly winds, subsiding air, and convective stability. Concentrations of CO and total odd nitrogen (NOy) are relatively high in the shallow planetary boundary layer (PBL) but decrease rapidly with altitude. Ozone, on the other hand, is uniformly distributed, suggesting limited photochemical production; in fact, nitric oxide, NO, mixing ratios fell below 10 ppt (parts per 10 • 2 by volume) in the midtroposphere. The maritime regime is characterized by southerly surface winds, convective instability, and a deep PBL; uniformly high concentrations of trace gases were found up to 4 km on one flight. Severe storms occur in maritime flow, especially when capped by a dry layer, and they transport large amounts of CO, Os, and NOy into the upper troposphere. Median NO levels at high altitude xceeded 300 ppt. Lightnin...|$|R
40|$|The Asteraceae {{family is}} one of the largest families, {{comprising}} 67 genera and 264 species in Poland. However, only a few genera, including Artemisia and Ambrosia are potential allergenic sources. The aim of the study was to estimate how often and to what degree Artemisia and Ambrosia pollen seasons co-occur intensifying human health risk, and how synoptic situations influence frequency of days with high pollen concentrations of both taxa. Artemisia and Ambrosia pollen data were collected, using the volumetric method, at 8 sites in Poland. Daily concentrations of Artemisia pollen equal to 30 grains or more and Ambrosia pollen equal to 10 grains or more were accepted as high values. Concentrations of more than 10 pollen grains were defined as high in the case of Ambrosia because its allergenicity is considered higher. High concentrations were confronted with synoptic situations. Analysis was performed on the basis of two calendars on circulation types of atmosphere in Poland (Niedźwiedź, 2006, 2015). Co-occurrence of Artemisia and Ambrosia pollen seasons is being found most often, when Ambrosia pollen season starts in the first half of August. If it happens in the last 10 days of August high pollen concentrations of Artemisia and Ambrosia do not occur at the same days. At three sites (Sosnowiec, Rzeszów, Lublin) high Ambrosia pollen concentrations during the Artemisia pollen season appear more often than in other sites under question. The high Artemisia pollen concentrations occur, when continental or <b>polar</b> <b>maritime</b> old <b>air</b> masses inflow into Poland. The impact of air masses on high Ambrosia pollen concentrations depends on site localizations. It is likely, that in the south-eastern part of Poland high Ambrosia pollen concentrations result from the pollen transport from east-south-south-westerly directions and the local sources. Co-occurrence of both taxa pollen seasons depends on the air masses inflow and appears more often in a southeastern part of Poland...|$|R
