5|$|The Old Man of Hoy {{is a red}} {{sandstone}} stack and {{perched on}} a plinth of basalt rock. It is separated from the mainland by a 60-metre (200ft) chasm strewn with debris, and has nearly vertical sides with a top just a few metres wide. The rock is composed of layers of soft, sandy and <b>pebbly</b> sandstone and harder flagstones of Old Red Sandstone, giving the sides a notched and slab-like profile.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, many {{specimens}} of a previously unidentified dinosaur were found associated {{together in the}} same bed and locality: a <b>pebbly</b> stratum near a route to Cerro Condor. The specimens were first described by Jose Bonaparte in 1979. For the fossil he erected the genus Patagosaurus, as well as its type species P. fariasi. The generic name of Patagosaurus comes from the location of its find in Patagonia, {{and the fact that it}} is a reptile. The specific name honours Ricardo Farias, on whose land the initial discovery was made. The genus was originally known from an almost complete postcranial skeleton lacking a skull as the holotype, and many referred specimens however in 2003 it was found that a dentary was referable to the species, so more specimens are probably this taxon. Its skeleton was found near those of Piatnitzkysaurus and Volkheimeria in the Callovian to Oxfordian aged Patagonian deposits of the Cañadón Asfalto Formation. Patagosaurus is almost completely known, with many articulated specimens found covering almost all of the skeleton, including parts of the skull. Over twelve specimens have been referred to the species, although some of the material is probably from a unique taxon. Bonaparte (1986) assigned three specimens other than the holotype PVL 4170, PVL 4076, MACN CH 934, and MACN CH 933 to the genus. While the holotype includes a post cranial skeleton, the others are known from cranial material and a nearly complete juvenile skeleton and skull. MACN CH 933 is directly comparable with the type material of Patagosaurus, which confirms its association with the genus. A specimen first referred to Patagosaurus in 2003, MPEF-PV 1670 (which includes just a lower jaw), is also very similar to MACN CH 934, and differences can be associated with age, so therefore, MPEF-PV 1670 presumably represents adult cranial material. However, the teeth of MACN CH 934 are very different from those of both lower jaws (MACN CH 933 and MPEF-PV 1670), so it can be identified as another sauropod from the same deposit as Patagosaurus. Thus, the taxon only certainly includes PVL 4170, MACN CH 933, and MPEF-PV 1670.|$|E

25|$|The volcaniclastic {{sandstone}} of the Seathwaite Fell Formation predominates, {{with the}} <b>pebbly</b> sandstone and breccia of the Pavey Ark Member exposed on the Langdale face.|$|E
25|$|The {{summit of}} the fell is formed of the Pavey Ark Member, <b>pebbly</b> {{sandstone}} and breccia from the Borrowdale Volcanic series. There is no history of mining within {{the area of the}} fell.|$|E
25|$|The summit area is {{composed}} of the dacitic welded lapilli-tuff and volcaniclastic sandstone of the Lincomb Tarns Formation. The southern crags reveal andesite sills and the <b>pebbly</b> sandstone and breccia of the Pavey Ark Member.|$|E
25|$|The {{face of the}} crag {{displays}} the <b>pebbly</b> sandstone and breccia of the Pavey Ark Member. The bulk of the fell is formed of the Seathwaite Formation, volcaniclastic sandstone with some conglomerates, breccia and andesite sills.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominant}} {{rocks on}} Bowfell are the volcaniclastic sandstones of the Seathwaite Fell Formation, with interbeds of andesite outcropping near the summit. The <b>pebbly</b> sandstone and breccias of the Pavey Ark Member also cross the fell.|$|E
25|$|The face is an outcrop of the {{formation}} named for the fell, the Pavey Ark Member. This consists of <b>pebbly</b> sandstone and breccia and is set within the Seathwaite Fell Formation of volcaniclastic sandstone with interbeds of tuff, lapilli-tuff, breccia and conglomerate.|$|E
25|$|The {{rearward}} slopes show {{evidence of}} the Pavey Ark Member, <b>pebbly</b> sandstone and breccia. The Langdale face displays several strata: from the top The Lingmell Formation, Crinkle Member and Bad Step Tuff.

25|$|Weston died at {{his home}} on Wildcat Hill on New Year’s Day, 1958. His sons {{scattered}} his ashes into the Pacific Ocean at an area then known as <b>Pebbly</b> Beach on Point Lobos. Due to Weston's significant influence in the area, the beach was later renamed Weston Beach. He had $300 in his bank account {{at the time of}} his death.|$|E
25|$|Wilmslow, Bulkeley Hill and Helsby Sandstone {{formations}} of the Sherwood Sandstone Group {{are present}} within the site, {{dating from the}} Early Triassic period around 250 million years ago. The fine-grained red sandstones which predominate in the lower rock levels represent sedimentation from sandy braided rivers, while the conglomerate beds of Delamere <b>Pebbly</b> Sandstone (a type of Helsby Sandstone formation) which occur in the upper levels represent the deposition of larger particles from coarse-grained braided rivers.|$|E
25|$|The only {{specimen}} of Daemonosaurus was recovered at the Ghost Ranch (Whitaker) quarry at the Siltstone Member of the Chinle Formation in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. Its remains {{were collected in}} the 1980s by E.H. Colbert in <b>pebbly,</b> calcareous conglomerate from the Rhaetian stage of the Triassic period, approximately 208 to 201 million years ago. This specimen is housed {{in the collection of}} the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|Mushroom anchors are {{the most}} common anchors and work best for softer seabeds such as mud, sand, or silt. They are shaped like an {{upside-down}} mushroom which can be easily buried in mud or silt. The advantage is that it has up to ten times the holding-power-to-weight ratio compared to a dead weight mooring; disadvantages include high cost, limited success on rocky or <b>pebbly</b> substrates, and the long time it takes to reach full holding capacity.|$|E
25|$|The first recipe in French for {{flavoured}} ices {{appears in}} 1674, in Nicholas Lemery’s Recueil de curiositéz rares et nouvelles de plus admirables effets de la nature. Recipes for sorbetti saw publication in the 1694 edition of Antonio Latini's Lo Scalco alla Moderna (The Modern Steward). Recipes for flavoured ices begin {{to appear in}} François Massialot's Nouvelle Instruction pour les Confitures, les Liqueurs, et les Fruits, starting with the 1692 edition. Massialot's recipes result in a coarse, <b>pebbly</b> texture. Latini claims {{that the results of}} his recipes should have the fine consistency of sugar and snow.|$|E
25|$|The Ocetá Páramo {{is mostly}} {{accessed}} from Monguí along the Camino de la Otra Vida; a full-day hike, ascending and back descending , that takes between six and eleven hours. A steep and <b>pebbly</b> {{access to the}} Ocetá Páramo is indicated with a gate called Portal de la Gloria. It is possible to access the páramo by horse and do wild camping on the páramo. The use of a trained guide is recommended, as the journey contains many paths and the sudden mist can be cold and dangerous due {{to the loss of}} orientation. The best months to visit the páramo are November and December.|$|E
25|$|Harrison Stickle's summit area is {{composed}} of the <b>pebbly</b> sandstone and breccia of the Pavey Ark Member. Several greenstone knapping sites have been found below the main peak, and following the strike of the tuff exploited at nearby Pike O'Stickle in the neolithic period. The sites on Pike O'Stickle have been well described as the Langdale axe industry, {{but they have been}} found to be much more widespread than originally thought. The rock was roughly shaped on site, and then traded across the country, where the final polishing could be undertaken. Such polished axes have been found in Buckinghamshire for example as well as in East Anglia. The axes varied widely in size, shape and function, and most were designed to be fitted with either wooden or bone handles (using pointed butt ends or narrow waists).|$|E
25|$|The Opotiki {{district}} is bounded on one long side by {{the eastern half}} of the Bay of Plenty embayment of the Pacific Ocean and on the other long side by the Raukumara mountain range which rises to 1754m (5755ft) at Mt. Hikurangi. The {{district is}} predominantly steep hills dissected by fast-flowing rivers, the largest being the Motu. The coastal riverine floodplains (‘flats’) and terraces (‘tablelands’) provide the only flat land. Opotiki township is situated on the largest flat at the conjunction of two of these, the Otara River and the Waioeka River. Sandy beaches, lower hills and larger flats are characteristic of the southwest area of the district; <b>pebbly</b> or rocky beaches and high hills coming right down to the sea are characteristic of the northeast. Current human population is therefore concentrated in the coastal southwest. The district has a land area of 3,104.54km² (1,198.67 sq mi).|$|E
25|$|Gartenskulptor (Garden Sculpture), for instance, {{had started}} out as a copy of the {{multiple}} P.O.TH.A.A.VFB, a self-portrait bust made of chocolate and birdseed standing on a bird-table, exposed to the elements. Referred to by Roth as a 'dis- and re-assembly object', each new incarnation gradually acquired working drawings, paintings, sculpted rabbits and collages placed on trellises in collector's gardens. It even acquired a real rabbit and the rabbit's hutch for a number of years. The last time it was installed in a garden was in 1989. When it was exhibited indoors in Switzerland, 1992, Gartenskulptor took up an entire room. By 1995 it was 20m long and included all sorts of objects including a fire ladder and television screens. By 2000, in Mönchengladbach, it was 40 metres long, having acquired elements from each of the installations' incarnations, including <b>pebbly</b> earth excavated by the architects Herzog and de Meuron for the facade of the Schaulager, for instance. The rabbit was no longer present.|$|E
25|$|Three {{other main}} beds are seen at Alderley Edge. The first is friable mottled {{sandstone}} {{similar to the}} Upper Mottled Sandstone, the Beacon Lodge Sandstone which attains a thickness of 12m and {{can be seen at}} Beacon Lodge resting above the conglomerates. The second is a conglomerate which overlies the Brynlow and is seen by the site of the old mines and is thus called the West Mine Conglomerate. There are ten upward fining cycles in this rock and it has a thickness of 40m. The third rock is creamy white sandstone, which lacks the <b>pebbly</b> beds and is upward fining; it overlies the West Mine Conglomerate and is seen in outcrops at Brynlow. This is the Wood Mine Sandstone it has a thickness of 16m. Two other minor beds are seen to the southeast of these areas a single cycle conglomerate/sandstone/marl of 9m thickness known as the Brynlow conglomerate and a final bed that overlies the Brynlow Conglomerate and is named the Nether Alderley Sandstone. On top of the Nether Alderley Sandstone lie the Mercia Mudstones which attain a thickness of 300m, but these are only seen on the lower plains, it is in these beds that the halite lies.|$|E
500|$|The Pocono Beds {{are found}} near Shickshinny Creek, on Shickshinny Mountain. The Pocono Beds are {{found at the}} same level as the creek {{slightly}} north of Shickshinny. This rock formation consists of [...] of gray sandstone and brownish sandy shales. Approximately [...] below the Pocono Beds is a layer of rock approximately [...] thick and composed of <b>pebbly</b> sandstone. This may be the Mount Pleasant Formation. The Mauch Chunk Formation is also found in the watershed. Additionally, the Chemung Beds are found on parts of the creek.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{was present}} at the Normandy Landings wearing a large head bandage but, {{according}} to Meyers, he was considered [...] "precious cargo" [...] and not allowed ashore. The landing craft came within sight of Omaha Beach before coming under enemy fire and turning back. Hemingway later wrote in Collier's that he could see [...] "the first, second, third, fourth and fifth waves of [...] lay where they had fallen, looking like so many heavily laden bundles on the flat <b>pebbly</b> stretch between the sea and first cover." [...] Mellow explains that, on that first day, none of the correspondents were allowed to land and Hemingway was returned to the Dorothea Dix.|$|E
500|$|Marine {{habitats}} include brackish water, estuaries, bays, {{the open}} sea, the intertidal zone, the sea bed, reefs and deep water zones. Further variations include rock pools, sand banks, mudflats, brackish lagoons, sandy and <b>pebbly</b> beaches, and seagrass beds, all supporting their own flora and fauna. The benthic zone or seabed provides {{a home for}} both static organisms, anchored to the substrate, and for a large range of organisms crawling on or burrowing into the surface. Some creatures float among the waves {{on the surface of}} the water, or raft on floating debris, others swim at a range of depths, including [...] organisms in the demersal zone close to the seabed, and myriads of organisms drift with the currents and form the plankton.|$|E
500|$|On Santa Catalina Island, {{boulders}} {{estimated to}} weigh [...] were tossed inland by the surf. Substantial damage {{took place at}} the Avalon Harbor where many dry-docked boats were knocked off their stands. The harbor was littered with debris for several days, mainly pieces of lumber. A pier at White's Landing was also partially destroyed. A [...] boat was tossed onshore at <b>Pebbly</b> Beach into Catalina Laundry, the only laundry business on the island. The building and a nearby boatyard were deemed total losses. Damage at the beach was deemed the worst since September 1997 when Hurricane Linda brought large swells to the region. The Catalina Express ferry halted service on August27 due to the rough seas. Damage across Catalina Island was estimated to be $3–5million. Total losses in California amounted to nearly $20million.|$|E
500|$|Based on the {{principle}} of phylogenetic bracketing, it was predicted that Tyrannosaurids might also possess such feathering. However, a study in 2017 published by a team of researchers in Biology Letters described Tyrannosaurid skin impressions collected in Alberta, Montana and Mongolia, which came from five genera (Tyrannosaurus, Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Daspletosaurus and Tarbosaurus.) [...] Although the skin impressions are small, they are widely dispersed across the post-cranium, being collectively located on the abdomen, thoracic region, ilium, pelvis, tail and neck. They show a tight pattern of fine, non-overlapping <b>pebbly</b> scales (which co-author Scott Persons compared to those seen on the flanks of an crocodile) and preserve no hints of feathering. The basic texture is composed of tiny [...] "basement scales" [...] approximately 1-2mm in diameter, with some impressions showing 7mm [...] "feature scales" [...] interspersed between them. Additional scales can be seen in Tyrannosaurid footprints and potential ostelogical correlates for scales are present on the skull.|$|E
500|$|The mountainous {{terrain of}} the {{peninsula}} and its numerous caverns, canyons, and valleys result in the area being of high interest to both visitors and researchers. There are several coves along the shore that have been named {{in order to identify}} them easily. Upon entering the park from the east, the first and easternmost beach available to the public is known as İçmeler Cove (...) [...] This cove's waters are shallower than any other in the park, and its beaches are sandy, unlike some of the coves farther out. Therefore, it appears to be more popular amongst tourists than most of the remaining beaches and parts of Kuşadası that are visible along the horizon from it. Aydınlık Cove is situated about [...] further to the west, and has <b>pebbly</b> shores and deeper waters. It marks the transition point where the waters {{of the peninsula}}'s beaches become more challenging. As a result, these beaches tend to attract more experienced swimmers and locals rather than tourists. After passing the jandarma (public safety patrol) checkpoint, a turn onto a road leads to a nearby canyon, immediately to the left. From this point on, there are several trails through the forests of the peninsula. One of them leads to the village of Doğanbey, and if followed further, leads to the nearby ancient Hellenistic port city of Karine. However, this path's final [...] are limited in access, and a permit or an accompanying tour guide is required to proceed. The third cove along the peninsula, Kavaklı Burun Cove, and the final, westernmost cove accessible to the public, Karasu Cove, both provide close views of the island of Samos, and are significantly less visited than the former coves of the peninsula. At {{the very end of the}} peninsula appears its tallest mountain, Mycale (...) , which looms over Samos and the strait of its namesake.|$|E
2500|$|Outside {{of the bay}} {{and just}} north of the Casino is Descanso Beach, a private beach, {{entertainment}} and meetings venue run by the Santa Catalina Island Company. At the farthest north end of town are the Hamilton Cove condominiums, a gated community consisting mostly of second homes. South of the bay is Lovers Cove dive park, a marine reserve frequented by both snorkelers and the classic glass-bottom boat tours. [...] Further south still is <b>Pebbly</b> Beach, an industrial area home to the heliport and <b>Pebbly</b> Beach Generating Station where Avalon gets its power.|$|E
2500|$|Geographically, Abruzzo {{is located}} in central Italy and {{southern}} Italy, stretching {{from the heart of}} the Apennines to the Adriatic Sea, and includes mainly mountainous and wild land.

2500|$|Scansoriopteryx had a non-perforated hip socket, {{which is}} more open in most, but not all, other dinosaurs. It also had a pubis (hip bone) which pointed forward, a {{primitive}} trait among theropods, and unlike some maniraptorans {{more closely related to}} birds, where the pubis points downward or backward. The legs were short, and preserve small <b>pebbly</b> scales along the upper foot (metatarsus), as well as possible impressions of long feathers in the same area, possibly similar to the [...] "hind wings" [...] of Microraptor and other basal paravians. It also had an unusually large first toe, or hallux, which was low on the foot and may have been reversed, allowing some grasping ability.|$|E

Males can grow to [...] long, while females reach a maximum size of [...] Males commonly weigh around , with large specimens up to [...] or more, against the female weight of [...] In areas such as Lake Argyle and Katherine Gorge there exist a handful of confirmed [...] individuals. This species is shy and has a more slender snout and have slightly smaller teeth than the dangerous saltwater crocodile. The body colour is light brown with darker bands on the body and tail—these tend to be broken up near the neck. Some individuals possess distinct bands or speckling on the snout. Body scales are relatively large, with wide, close-knit armoured plates on the back. Rounded, <b>pebbly</b> scales cover the flanks and outsides of the legs.|$|E
2500|$|Skin-impressions of Pelorosaurus {{and other}} sauropods (dinosaurs with elephantine bodies and long necks) reveal large {{hexagonal}} scales, and some sauropods, such as Saltasaurus, had bony plates in their skin. The skin of ceratopsians consisted of large polygonal scales, sometimes with scattered circular plates. [...] "Mummified" [...] remains and skin impressions of hadrosaurids reveal <b>pebbly</b> scales. It {{is unlikely that}} the ankylosaurids, such as Euoplocephalus, had insulation, as most of their surface area was covered in bony knobs and plates. Likewise {{there is no evidence of}} insulation in the stegosaurs. Thus insulation, and the elevated metabolic rate behind evolving them, may have been limited to the theropods, or even just a subset of theropods. Worth mentioning is that filaments similar to feathers has been found on three species of small ornithischians, those being Psittacosaurus, Tianyulong and Kulindadromeus, but whether these are true feathers, or the result of convergent evolution is unclear.|$|E
2500|$|The city {{is served}} by several {{high-speed}} passenger boats with daily services such as the Catalina Express to the Los Angeles district of San Pedro, and to Long Beach, and Dana Point. Daily service is also provided by the Catalina Flyer to Newport Beach in Orange County. Private vessels that come to Avalon Harbor are assigned a mooring by the Avalon Harbor Patrol on a first-come, first-served basis. Boaters can get from their vessels to shore either by mooring their dinghies {{at one of the}} dinghy docks, or by catching a ride on a private shoreboat. Several helicopter companies serve the city, with most landing at the <b>Pebbly</b> Beach Heliport, located south of Avalon Bay. Small planes can also land at the Catalina Airport, known as the Airport in the Sky, located [...] northwest of Avalon. [...] Historically, during the early 1970s, scheduled passenger seaplane service was operated by Catalina Air Lines, a division of Golden West Airlines, between Avalon Harbor and both Long Beach Airport and the Orange County Airport (now John Wayne Airport). [...] Golden West Airlines also operated de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter STOL turboprops with scheduled passenger service at this same time between Airport in the Sky and both Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Long Beach Airport.|$|E
2500|$|Located at the {{confluence}} of the Nashua and Merrimack rivers, Dunstable was first settled about 1654 as a fur trading town. Like many 19th century riverfront New England communities, it would be developed during the Industrial Revolution with textile mills operated from water power. By 1836, the Nashua Manufacturing Company had built three cotton mills which produced 9.3 million yards of cloth annually on 710 looms. On December 31, 1836, the New Hampshire half of Dunstable was renamed [...] "Nashua", after the Nashua River, by a declaration of the New Hampshire legislature (the Dunstable name lives on across the Massachusetts border). The Nashua River was named by the Nashuway Indians, and in the Penacook language it means [...] "beautiful stream with a <b>pebbly</b> bottom", with an alternative meaning of [...] "land between two rivers". In 1842 the town split again in two for eleven years following a dispute between the area north of the Nashua, and the area south of the river. During that time the northern area (today [...] "French Hill") called itself [...] "Nashville", while the southern part kept the name Nashua. They reconciled in 1853 and joined together to charter the [...] "city of Nashua". Six railroad lines crossed the mill town, namely the Boston, Lowell and Nashua; Worcester and Nashua; Nashua and Acton; Nashua and Wilton; Concord and Nashua; and Rochester railroads; with 56 trains entering and departing daily in the years before the Civil War. These various railroads led to all sections of the country, north, east, south, and west. The Jackson Manufacturing Company employed hundreds of workers in the 1870s.|$|E
2500|$|By the Triassic, the Permian Zechstein Sea {{had retreated}} and the climate {{had become a}} little wetter giving a gentle {{transition}} making the Permian-Triassic boundary uncertain in northern England as there are no fossil horizons or facies changes that make a definitive separation possible as there in continental Europe. The horizon however is characterised by a succession of red marls (calcareous mudstones) deposited on coastal flats, followed by the Sherwood Sandstone (formerly Bunter Sandstone). [...] The 'British Isles' were not islands, but had an intra-continental position within Pangea. The area that now constitutes Great Britain was drifting northwards as Pangea rotated, was at a latitude of 10° - 20° north, equivalent to the latitude of the present day Sahara desert. Erosion of the then recently uplifted landmass formed Aeolian deposits in the southern and central parts of the country. This iron-rich silica sandstone was both oxidised and reworked to give it its red colouration and its name, [...] "New Red Sandstone". British deposits of the era consist of these red beds, alluvial, fluvial and lake deposits, with some shallow-water marine and evaporite deposits. These Permo-Triassic outcrops {{can be seen on}} either side of the Pennines and in Devon. Within the main central England basin (Staffordshire and Cheshire), the deposits are dominated by <b>pebbly</b> sandstones and conglomerates (Chester Pebble Beds, Wilmslow and Wildmoor Sandstones), which have been interpreted as the deposits of a fluvial system running within well-confined channels. The Sherwood Sandstone Group comprises a series of conglomerates, coarse sandstones and mudstones. The Chester pebble beds to the south of Alderley represent material deposited in alluvial fan/braided river system. The finer sediments of the Wilmslow and Helsby Sandstone to the west of Alderley represent alluvial deposits of low sinuosity channels. The Alderley area represents the midpoint between the full braided river system and the lower energy area. Minor aeolian dunes and channel infill deposits in the Wilmslow Sandstones indicate an inter channel area or seasonal drying of some of the minor river channels.|$|E
