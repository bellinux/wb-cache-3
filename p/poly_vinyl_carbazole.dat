40|$|Solution {{processed}} {{multilayer polymer}} light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) based on different molecular weight host have been investigated. A PLED based on {{high molecular weight}} <b>poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> <b>carbazole)</b> PVKH and low molecular weight <b>poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> <b>carbazole)</b> PVKL, doped with iridium, tris(2 -phenylpyidine) Ir(ppy) 3 as a host-guest emitting layer (EML), shows {{a dramatic increase in}} device efficiency. When the PVKH was used as a hole transport electron blocking layer (HT-EBL), effective electron blocking was achieved, which leads to an increase exciton population in the phosphorescent zone. The use of low molecular weight PVKL as a host material in the top layer prevents barrier formation for hole transport from the poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxy-thiophene) (PEDOT) –EBL to the EML. External quantum efficiency of 11 %, current efficiencies of 38 cd/A, power efficiency of 13 lm/W and brightness of 7000 cd/m 2, were obtained. The effect of the PVKH layer on the electrical and optical device characteristics was investigated. Simulation of the optical outcoupling using SETFOS 3. 1 software is in agreed with the observed results and allowed us to predict the emissive dipole location and distribution in the EML layer. The effect of the PVKH on the exciton quenching by the electrodes was also investigated using time resolved fluorescence photon counting, which indicates weak exciton quenching by the PEDOT layer and the device enhancement predominantly achieved by exciton confinement in the emissive layer...|$|E
40|$|Energy EngineeringMetal oxides such as LiCoO 2 and LiMn 2 O 4 {{have been}} widely used as cathode {{materials}} of lithium ion batteries. The inorganic compounds provide practically high capacity based on the redox activity of d orbital transition metals with structural stability leading to cycle retention. As a logical alternative to the conventional cathode materials, also, organic cathode materials have attracted academic attentions from the viewpoint of (1) unlimited elemental resources and (2) elastic properties guaranteeing flexibility in case of polymeric materials. In this work, <b>poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> <b>carbazole)</b> (PVK) was studied as an electro-active material for cathode materials of lithium ion batteries. PVK showed binder and conductive agent-dependent performances probably because of its volumetric change during oxidation. More elastic polymer binder and use of carbon nanotubes as a conductive agent guaranteed higher capacity (120 mAh g- 1 at 0. 1 C) and enhanced rate capability (up to several hundreds of C-rate). Optimized condition for making electrode composites would allow practical application of PVK to cathode materials for rechargeable batteries. Moreover, A 1 D organic redox-active material is composited with another 1 D conductive material for rechargeable batteries. <b>Poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> <b>carbazole)</b> (or PVK) and Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (or PEDOT:PSS) are used as the redoxactive and conductive 1 D materials, respectively. Due to their extreme anisotropic geometry, the two polymers are expected to be inter-tangled with each other, showing an kinetically ideal model system in which each redox-active moiety of PVK is supposed to be directly connected with the conducting pathways of PEDOT:PSS. In addition to the role of conductive agents providing kinetic benefits, PEDOT:PSS works as an efficient binder that guarantees enhanced electrochemical performances with only a tenth of the amount of a conventional binder (polyvinylidene fluoride or PVdF). The benefit of gravimetric energy density gain obtained with the conductive binder comes mainly from efficient spatial coverage of binding volume due to the low density of PEDOT:PSS. Towards realizing flexible allpolymer batteries, a quasi-all-polymer battery half-cell is designed with the PVK/ PEDOT:PSS composite with a polymer gel electrolyte. ope...|$|E

The experimental results prove that modified membranes with an even <b>poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> alcohol) hydrogel layer show dramatically high anti-fooling characteristics compared to inadequately modified and unmodified membranes.

The dust produced by mechanical rubbing along with problems due to friction and uneven roller pressure lead to defects in the display. Therefore a novel method for aligning polymers films by irradiation with polarised light has been attempted. Anisotropy introduced into the films by selective irradiation affects liquid crystal alignment. The polymers {{used in this study}} are <b>poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> cinnamate), <b>poly</b> (9 - anthraceneoate ethyl methacrylate) and poly (p-azidobenzoate ethyl methacrylate). <b>Poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> cinnamate) is a classical photoresist polymer which undergoes a [2 + 2] photocycloaddition in the presence of UV light. Poly (9 -anthraceneoate ethyl methacrylate) and poly (p-azidobenzoate ethyl methacrylate) are both novel polymers which have the potential to undergo photo-crosslinking reactions. Poly (9 -anthraceneoate ethyl methacrylate) contains an anthracene-terminated side chain which dimerises under the influence of UV light introducing anisotropy into the system. Poly (p-azidobenzoate ethyl methacrylate) contains an azido group which when irradiated with polarised light loses nitrogen to yield nitrenes which can combine to form azobenzene species.

Besides their similar conformation (only the functional side group differs), poly (acrylic acid) was chosen to be in aqueous solution in contrast to a <b>poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> alcohol) melt. For <b>poly</b> (<b>vinyl</b> alcohol) a non-optimized bond angle potential turns out to be sufficient in connection with a special, optimized non-bonded potential.
