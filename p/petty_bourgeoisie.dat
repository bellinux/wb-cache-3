Commenting on this [...] "New Age capitalism", Hess observed that it was largely small-scale and entrepreneurial, focused around small companies run by members of the <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie,</b> rather than being dominated by large scale multinational corporations. The links between New Age and commercial products have resulted in the accusation that New Age itself {{is little more than a}} manifestation of consumerism. This idea is generally rejected by New Age participants, who often reject any link between their practices and consumerist activities.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the flag comes with cultural, political, and {{regional}} meanings. The colour itself is significant; red is a festive colour for the Chinese people, used to {{convey a sense of}} celebration and nationalism. Moreover, the red colour is identical to that used in the national PRC flag, chosen to signify the link re-established between post-colonial Hong Kong and China. The position of red and white on the flag symbolises the [...] "one country two systems" [...] political principle applied to the region. The stylised rendering of the Bauhinia blakeana flower, a flower discovered in Hong Kong, is meant to serve as a harmonising symbol for this dichotomy. The five stars of the Chinese national flag, representing the Communist Party and Mao Zedong's four classes (proletarian workers, agricultural peasants, <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> and capitalists), are replicated on the petals of the flower.|$|E

Next {{it should be pointed out}} that the source of ultra-democracy consists in the <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie's</b> individualistic aversion to discipline.

500|$|Zeng Liansong, {{a citizen}} from Wenzhou, Zhejiang, {{was working in}} Shanghai {{at the time the}} {{announcement}} came out; he wanted to create a flag design to express his patriotic enthusiasm for the new country. In the middle of July, he sat down in his attic for multiple nights to come up with designs. His inspiration for the current design comes from the stars shining in the night sky. He thought of a Chinese proverb [...] "longing for the stars, longing for the moon", ( [...] , pàn xīngxīng pàn yuèliàng) which shows yearning. He viewed the CPC as the great saviour ( [...] , dà jiùxīng [...] "great saving star") of the Chinese people, being represented by a larger star. The idea for four small stars came from On the People's Democratic Dictatorship a speech by Mao Zedong, which defined the Chinese people as consisting of four social classes, also referred to in Asian cultures as the four occupations (...) shi, nong, gong, shang ("the working class, the peasantry, the urban <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> and the national bourgeoisie").

2500|$|Following in the {{footsteps}} of previous military strongmen like Plaek Phibunsongkhram and Sarit Thanarat, Thanom became prime minister in 1963 following Sarit's death. He oversaw a massive influx of financial aid from the United States and Japan, fuelling the Thai economy, as well as increasing American cultural influence. But by the early-1970s, the US was withdrawing its troops from Indochina. In such a context, the Thai middle class and <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> who had supported student efforts in 1973 to topple the Thanom regime were more a product of their immediate history than devotees of democracy. They lacked political experience and so had no real idea of the consequences of ending the dictatorship. The regime was simultaneously blamed both for failing to exact fuller commitments from its allies and for excessive subservience to Washington. The support given by the Thai middle class and <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> to the 1973 student protests was not an unconditional stamp of approval for democratic processes and the chaos that followed. The [...] "chaotic democracy" [...] from 1973 to 1976 was seen as having threatened the economic interests of the middle class and <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> who favored stability and peace above democracy. In light of this, while they supported the mass demonstrations against the Thanom regime leading up to the uprising on 14 October 1973, they turned their backs on democracy, hence Anderson's use of the phrase [...] "withdrawal symptoms", and welcomed the return to dictatorship on 6 October 1976, heralding the end of the period of chaotic democracy.|$|E

Using the theory of historical materialism, I attempt to show that Count Dracula is {{the symbol of the}} 19 th century feudal while his opponents the (<b>petty</b> and big) <b>bourgeoisies</b> of the same century. The Count is the monopolistic feudal who tries to revive the ancient mode of concentration and monopoly. His monopolistic feudalism can be seen from his tendency toward territorial expansion and total submission of his subjects. The bourgeoisies in the novel are what Marx Engels ridicule as the socialistic bourgeoisies who characterize the Victorian Capitalism. Still brand-new, ashamed of themselves, and troubled by guilty feeling, these bourgeoisies try to use their money and both scientific and superstitious knowledge to do good. And yet this in-betweenness is the key of their success in defeating the one dimensional Dracula...|$|R
2500|$|The {{establishment}} of Sămănătorul was linked by researchers {{to a set}} of significant events of fin de siècle European economic history. Spanish historian Francisco Veiga placed the emergence of Sămănătorul in direct connection to a European-wide evolution of capitalism and related phenomena affecting the middle class: [...] "In the traumatic circumstances of late 19th and early 20th century imperialist crises [...] and the rejection of urban-industrial society by the <b>petty</b> and medium <b>bourgeoisie</b> threatened by the crisis of capitalism, Sămănătorism can be identified with those groups of intellectual movements seeking to preserve national identity in front of threats, by resorting to an idealized past." [...] Alongside the [...] "identity crisis" [...] provoked by [...] "the traumatic advance of industrial modernization inside a country with a majority peasant and illiterate population", researcher Paul Cernat discusses the [...] "decline" [...] of local boyar aristocracy as issues preparing the ground for Sămănătorul and like-minded journals. Likewise, Swedish art historian Tom Sandqvist views Sămănătoruls focus on the peasant community as a source of legitimate culture as connected with economic change and [...] "emerging industrialization": [...] "In the mid-1870s grain prices had declined catastrophically, and it became more and more obvious that the image of the grateful farmer and the 'natural' village community as bearer of true Romanian culture was false and did not correspond very well with a reality characterized by utmost poverty, misery, autocratic boyars, ruthless profiteers, moneylenders, and village gendarmes". The emergence of Sămănătorism and Poporanism, Sandqvist notes, happened [...] "in spite of this—or rather because of it", since both still proclaimed [...] "the special character of Romanian culture as deriving from the traditional village community." [...] Researcher Rodica Lascu-Pop presents a similar perspective, discussing Sămănătorism as [...] "an echo of mutations occurring in society {{at the beginning of the}} century: the acute crisis of the peasant issue , the social gap between the urban and rural environments." ...|$|R
2500|$|Tunisian {{scholars}} {{described the}} rivalry {{between the two}} parties: [...] "The Old Destour was a party of notables, well-raised distinguished people, Arabists formed in majority in the Ez-Zitouna University. Bourguiba and his fellows had, overall, a very different profile and view. From the <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> of the coast, they were considered, scornfully, as Afaqiyin, those who came from behind the horizon, a euphemism for designating provincials. They had a modern, bilingual education and thus were also comfortable both in French and Arabic, were close to the people, whom they addressed with its spoken language, in Tunisian Arabic, and had the ambition to create a large mass party".|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} Arab socialism, {{accused of being}} narrow-minded and nationalistic, was {{replaced}} with the [...] "Arab road to socialism" [...] concept. [...] The Points of Departure criticized the classical Ba'athist view regarding private ownership. Classical Ba'athists supported private ownership {{as a way to}} recruit into the party many petty bourgeois elements. The document called for nationalization of the commanding heights of the economy, the slow incorporation of the <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> into the socialist economy and the elimination of the national bourgeoisie and its allied classes. To safeguard the party from evolving into one supporting state capitalism, the socialist economy would be controlled by a vanguard party together with popular participation from the toiler masses.|$|E
2500|$|A {{parallel}} {{recovery of}} Sămănătorist views is argued {{to have taken}} place in the Soviet Union's Moldavian SSR, formed from the bulk of the Bessarabia upon the 1940 breakup of Greater Romania. While the local population's cultural identification with Romania was officially discouraged and repressed during the adoption of Moldovenist ideology, the rural aesthetics of Sămănătorism were adapted to the proletarian themes favored by official culture. This phenomenon was later described by literary critic Iulian Ciocan in terms of cultural synthesis: [...] "Sămănătorism was harnessed to the rumbling wagon of proletkultism. The original ideology was, of course, retouched. 'National specificity' was replaced with 'social class specificity', subordinated to 'proletarian internationalism', and the contrast between the idyllic village and the dehumanized city [...] is supplanted by the animosity between the agricultural proletariat and the (<b>petty)</b> <b>bourgeoisie.</b> The working class, attenuating the rift between village and city, is called to the forefront." [...] According to Ciocan, the reaction against this merger was less significant than in Romania, even though postmodern authors also emerged in the Moldavian SSR.|$|E
2500|$|By 1912, Stroescu {{was living}} in Lausanne, but still {{appeared}} incognito to celebrate the golden jubilee of Petru Maior Society in Budapest. However, he was expressing his disenchantment with his Transylvanian colleagues. His letters to his fund's beneficiaries often included [...] "drastic reprimands." [...] In early 1913, he published a piece in the newspaper Românul of Arad, attacking Romanian banks for paying dividends higher than 5%, and their clients for accepting them; the difference, he argued, could go toward sponsoring culture. Responding to this [...] "judicious and unusually categorical" [...] critique, the economist Ion Mateiu suggested that the reduction demanded by Stroescu was needlessly abrupt. Stroescu, who donated 50,000 Kronen to settling disputes between ASTRA and the popular banks, {{and then to the}} creation of alternative credit unions, found sympathy with the writing team at Luceafărul, which basked in his critique of [...] "our <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> [...] its plutocratic ideals". Through ASTRA, he also distributed his brochure Statutele și îndrumările pentru băncile poporale ("Statutes and Guiding for the People's Banks"). The Bihar County bankers objected to such initiatives, seeing Stroescu as an unfair competitor to their business.|$|E

5000|$|Karl Marx saw the [...] "June Days" [...] {{uprising}} {{as strong}} evidence of class conflict. Marx saw the 1848 Revolution as being {{directed by the}} desires of the middle-class. While the bourgeoisie agitated for [...] "proper participation", workers had other concerns. Many {{of the participants in}} the revolution were of the so-called petite bourgeoisie (small business owners). In 1848, the [...] "petite" [...] or <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> outnumbered the working classes (unskilled laborers in mines, factories and stores, paid to perform manual labor and other work rather than for their expertise) by about two to one. However, the <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> was greatly indebted due to the economic recession of 1846-1847. By 1848, overdue business debt was 21,000,000 francs in Paris and 11,000,000 francs in the provinces. The February Revolution united all classes against Louis Philippe. The bourgeoisie joined with the working classes to fight for [...] "proper participation" [...] in the government for all sections and classes in society. But after the revolution, the working classes were disillusioned by their small share of that participation, and revolted in the streets. This frightened the bourgeoisie and they repressed the uprising during the June Days. The petit bourgeoisie worked the hardest to suppress the revolt. Its financial condition had deteriorated even further due to slow sales and economic dislocations of the Revolution. As of June 1848, over 7,000 shopkeepers and merchants in Paris had not paid their rent since February. During the June Days, their creditors and landlords (the finance bourgeoisie), forestalled most attempts to collect on those debts. But once the worker revolt was put down, they began to assert their claims in court. Thus, the financial bourgeoisie turned their back on the <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie.</b> [...] Bankruptcies and foreclosures rose dramatically. The <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> staged a large demonstration at the National Assembly to demand that the government inquire into the problem of foreclosures and for debt to be extended for businessmen who could prove that their insolvency was caused by the Revolution. Such a plan was introduced in the National Assembly but was rejected. The <b>petty</b> <b>bourgeoisie</b> was pauperized and many small merchants became part of the working class.|$|E
