40|$|The serum {{levels of}} {{specific}} IgE antibodies to food allergens and inhalant allergens were evaluated in ninety five patients with bronchial asthma using the MAST system, which can measure specific IgE antibodies against sixteen different allergens {{with a single}} sample. 1. Higher <b>positivities</b> of specific IgE antibodies were found in inhaled allergens than in food allergens. Specific IgE antibodies against several allergens were detected in individuals more frequently in inhaled allergens than in food allergens. 2. <b>Positivities</b> of specific IgE antibodies against food allergens did not correlate to patients' age and patients' age at onset. In inhaled allergens, positive results in MAST system were frequently observed in patients under age of 50 and under age at onset of 60. 3. In subjects with high serum IgE levels, high <b>positivities</b> of specific IgE antibodies against inhaled allergens and food allergen were found. 4. The MAST system is suggested to be clinically more useful than RAST. 気管支喘息 95 例を対象に,MASTシステムにより吸入抗原,食餌抗原の陽性率を検討した｡その結果,吸入抗原の方が食餌抗原よりも陽性者が高率にみられ,さらに複数個の抗原に陽性の傾向が見られた｡また 8 名の食餌抗原陽性者の内 7 名が吸入抗原陽性であった｡MAST陽性率と年令,発症年令には食餌抗原では明らかな相関は見られなかったが,吸入抗原では, 50 才以下の症例に陽性率がやや高い傾向が,発症年令が 60 才以下の症例の陽性率が高い傾向が見られた｡食餌抗原では血清IgE値が 300 IU/ml以上の症例で陽性者がみられ, 1001 IU/ml以上の症例では 66. 7 %と比較的高率であった｡一方,吸入抗原に対する陽性率は,血清IgE値が 500 IU/ml以上の症例で高く 70 %以上の陽性率であった｡以上の結果より 1 検体同時多項目(16 項目) 測定可能なMASTシステムは従来のRASTに比して臨床的に有用であると考えられた...|$|R

40|$|The commercially {{available}} radioallergosorbent test (RAST) is still widely {{used as a}} good diagnostic tool for diagnosis of allergic diseases.

In this study, we examined serum levels of specific IgE antibodies to food allergens and inhalant allergens in forty bronchial asthma patients using the MAST System. Higher <b>positivities</b> of specific IgE antibodies were found in inhaled allergens than in food allergens.

40|$|The <b>positivities</b> of {{two methods}} for the {{diagnosis}} of localised cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) were estimated in 280 patients enrolled in a clinical trial. The trial was conducted in an endemic area of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis and trial participants were patients with skin ulcers and positive leishmanin skin tests. Patients underwent aspirative skin punctures of the ulcerated lesions and lymph nodes for in vitro cultures, which were processed under field conditions at the local health centre. Skin lesion biopsies were tested at a reference laboratory using kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA) -PCR to detect DNA. The median time required to obtain a positive culture from the skin samples was seven days and the contamination rate of the samples was 1. 8 %. The <b>positivities</b> of the cultures from skin lesions, kDNA-PCR and {{the combination of the}} two methods were 78. 2 % (95 % CI: 73 - 82. 6 %), 89. 3 % (95 % CI: 85. 1 - 92. 4 %) and 97. 1 % (95 % CI: 94. 5 - 98. 5 %).

Whilst there is some research on the affective components (i. e., positive and negative affect) of well-being at the workplace involving SDT, the boundary conditions (i. e., moderators) {{for the relationship between}} self-determination needs satisfaction (SDNS) and these affective components have not been examined. Using a sample of employees from different industries in the United States, this study hypothesised and tested the moderating effects of three pairs of work environment variables (i. e., supportive-abusive supervisors, supportive-abusive colleagues, positive-negative working conditions) with contrasting valence (termed work <b>positivities</b> vs. work negativities) on the relationship between self-determination needs satisfaction and affective well-being outcomes at work (i. e., positive affect and negative affect). Both composite measures and the relevant subscales were tested. Results supported several hypotheses of moderator effects in which the strength of the relationship between SDNS and affective well-being at work was dependent on the level of work negativities (e. g. negative working conditions and abusive colleagues). Although several moderator effects in which the strength of the relationship between SDNS and positive affect at work were dependent on the level of work <b>positivities,</b> the nature of the interactions were not as hypothesised. Implications of the results and future directions for research were discussed in terms of the understanding self-determination needs satisfaction within the context of other work environment variables...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the role of causal attribution for performance monitoring in the medial frontal cortex. To this end, we compared internally and externally-caused errors in a selective attention task with respect to error-related EEG activity and error-induced adjustments of speed and attentional selectivity. Both error types evoked early negativities and later <b>positivities</b> in the response-locked event-related potential. However, whereas internal-ly-caused errors caused posterror slowing, externally-caused errors were followed by reduced attentional selec-tivity. Moreover, the amount of reduced attentional selec-tivity {{was related to the}} amplitude of the early negativity on externally-caused errors. This suggests that posterror adjustments are initiated on the basis of perceived causality and, thus, causal attribution of errors...|$|R
