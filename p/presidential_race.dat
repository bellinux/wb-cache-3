5|$|When Bill Clinton became {{president}} in 1993, a blind trust was established; in April 2007, the Clintons liquidated the blind trust {{to avoid the}} possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as Hillary undertook her <b>presidential</b> <b>race.</b> Later disclosure statements revealed that the couple's worth was now upwards of $50million, {{and that they had}} earned over $100million since 2000, with most of it coming from Bill's books, speaking engagements and other activities.|$|E
5|$|The Crisis carried editorials by Du Bois that {{supported}} the ideals of unionized labor but excoriated the racism demonstrated by its leaders, who systematically excluded blacks from membership. Du Bois also supported {{the principles of the}} Socialist Party (he was briefly a member of the party from 1910 to 1912), but he denounced the racism demonstrated by some socialist leaders.Lewis, p. 275 (denounced). Frustrated by Republican president Taft's failure to address widespread lynching, Du Bois endorsed Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 <b>presidential</b> <b>race,</b> in exchange for Wilson's promise to support black causes.|$|E
5|$|From 1858 to 1860, Crittenden {{sought out}} moderates from all {{sections}} {{of the country to}} effect compromise on the territorial and slavery issues, thus averting war. In 1860, he was named chair of the National Union Executive Committee, a group of congressmen and journalists who feared that sectional differences would destroy the Union. His efforts helped form the Constitutional Union Party later that year. Chosen as the keynote speaker at the party's national convention on May 9, 1860, many urged him to become their nominee for president. At age seventy-three, however, Crittenden was already contemplating retirement and instead orchestrated the nomination of John Bell, whom he actively supported in the 1860 <b>presidential</b> <b>race.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1987, {{the media}} speculated that Clinton {{would enter the}} <b>Presidential</b> <b>race</b> after {{incumbent}} New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and {{twice as long as}} it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered. Clinton presented himself as both a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.|$|E
5|$|In {{the state}} {{elections}} of 2012, during which {{all members of}} the legislature (but not the governor) were up for election, the shutdown was a major campaign issue. The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses of the legislature, giving the DFL full control of the state government. Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said the shutdown probably was one reason for their electoral defeat. However, other national and state issues may have had more of an influence on the result. The <b>presidential</b> <b>race</b> was also on the ballot, as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage Amendment and Voter ID Amendment, which had been put on the ballot by the legislature in 2011. All of these ballot items increased the turnout of DFL-leaning voters.|$|E
5|$|Klotter {{wrote that}} Breckinridge's {{sale of a}} female slave and her six-week-old child in November 1857 {{probably}} ended {{his days as a}} slaveholder. Slaves were not listed among his assets in the 1860 Census, but Heck noted that he had little need for slaves at that time, since he was living in Lexington's Phoenix Hotel after returning to Kentucky from his term as vice president. Some slavery advocates refused to support him in the 1860 <b>presidential</b> <b>race</b> because he was not a slaveholder. Klotter noted that Breckinridge fared better in rural areas of the South, where there were fewer slaveholders; in urban areas where the slave population was higher, he lost to Constitutional Unionist candidate John Bell, who owned 166 slaves. William C. Davis recorded that, in most of the South, the combined votes for Bell and Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas exceeded those cast for Breckinridge.|$|E
