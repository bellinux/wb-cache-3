50|$|The Palghat {{district}} {{where the}} temple is situated, has mainly paddy cultivation {{as the main}} occupation of the people. The district is called the ‘Rice Bowl’ of Kerala. The social and cultural customs of the people are, therefore, one way or other, connected with paddy cultivation. They believe that the Goddesses of ‘Kavu’ (temple) protect them in their ‘Thattakam’ (meaning the area where they live, surrounds the ‘Kavu’). The people make offerings to the Goddesses in their ‘Thattakam’ in the form agricultural produces having bearing on the seasonal agriculture. The people prayed for good harvest and as an offering for this, they celebrates ‘Kathir’ in the third Friday of the Malayalam month of ‘Vrichikam’. On this day, a procession carrying ‘Sarodam’, in a very ornately decorated form is taken out in the evening from the premises of Lord Muniyappan temple, situated at the southern side of the Bhagavathy temple and it culminates at the Manappully Bhagavathy temple at dusk, passing {{through the streets of}} Manappullikavu Nair Thara. Another procession from Kenathuparambu, also joins the procession at the Manappullikavu junction and culminates at the temple. An attractive part of this ‘Kathir’ is the procession carrying decorative umbrellas made of palm leaves tied to freshly cut bamboo poles accompanied by ‘drum beating’. The Kathir literally announces the ensuing ‘Vela’ festival. The procession also carries ‘Kathir Koodu’, small balls made of tender palm leaves containing freshly plucked ‘Nel kathir’ (paddy bunches) which are distributed to all the houses in the area and hung in the front yard of each house till the next ‘Kathir’. These practices continue to be observed even now with great pomp and show. After the ‘Kathir’, the next <b>preparatory</b> <b>function</b> of the Vela is ‘Kanyar’ (Kodiyettam), which is performed on the first Friday of the Malayalam Month ‘Kumbam’. The huge freshly cut bamboo pole (flag post) with a typical flag - Koora is hoisted in front of the temple with rituals. This declares and denotes the ensuing Manappully Bhagavathy Vela.|$|E

Stretch shortening cycle muscle function enhances performance during the final phase (concentric action) [205], and the increase in preparatory muscle activity with higher running speeds was suggested to be a mechanism to tolerate higher impact loads, regulate landing stiffness [206] and improve RE [177]. A recent study showed that a greater ratio of eccentric to concentric vastus lateralis muscle activity was associated with a lower metabolic demand during running (i.e. better RE) [207].|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} {{cerebellum}} in {{the anatomical}} and functional architecture of the brain {{is a matter of}} ongoing debate. We propose that cerebellar temporal processing contributes to speech perception on a number of accounts: temporally precise cerebellar encoding and rapid transmission of an event-based representation of the temporal structure of the speech signal serves to prepare areas in the cerebral cortex for the subsequent perceptual integration of sensory information. As speech dynamically evolves in time this fundamental <b>preparatory</b> <b>function</b> may extend its scope to the predictive allocation of attention in time and supports the fine-tuning of temporally specific models of the environment. In this framework, an oscillatory account considering a range of frequencies may best serve the linking of the temporal and speech processing systems.

40|$|According to the literature, imagining {{how things}} {{would have been better}} in the past (counterfactual thinking) serves to prepare for future, {{highlighting}} prescriptions that can be converted in future intentions and in a more appropriate behavior. This view implicitly assumes that people think about controllable elements in their counterfactual thoughts and that the content of imaginary thoughts about {{the past and the future}} is the same. However, some studies (Ferrante, Girotto, Stragà, & Walsh, 2013) found a temporal asymmetry between past and future hypothetical thinking: thinking about how a failure could be a success in the future (prefactual thinking) elicit more controllable elements than thinking about how the same failure could have been a success in the past. In the present study, we replicated and extended previous findings in a more ecological setting. Athletes who have just run a marathon were asked to generate counterfactual or prefactual thoughts. The results showed the same temporal asymmetry found in Ferrante et al. (2013). In addition, we found that focusing on training, instead of focusing on other elements, resulted in a greater intention to train harder for the next marathon in the prefactual condition, but not in the counterfactual condition. Taken together, these findings question the postulated <b>preparatory</b> <b>function</b> of counterfactual thinking...|$|E
40|$|Counterfactual {{thinking}} (reflecting on "what {{might have}} been") {{has been shown}} to enhance future performance by translating information about past mistakes into plans for future action. Prefactual thinking (imagining "what might be if…") may serve a greater preparative function than counterfactual thinking as it is future-orientated and focuses on more controllable features, thus providing a practical script to prime future behaviour. However, whether or not this difference in hypothetical thought content may translate into a difference in actual task performance has been largely unexamined. In Experiment 1 (n = 42), participants performed trials of a computer-simulated physical task, in between which they engaged in either task-related hypothetical thinking (counterfactual or prefactual) or an unrelated filler task (control). As hypothesised, prefactuals contained more controllable features than counterfactuals. Moreover, participants who engaged in either form of hypothetical thinking improved significantly in task performance over trials compared to participants in the control group. The difference in thought content between counterfactuals and prefactuals, however, did not yield a significant difference in performance improvement. Experiment 2 (n = 42) replicated these findings in a dynamic balance task environment. Together, these findings provide further evidence for the <b>preparatory</b> <b>function</b> of counterfactuals, and demonstrate that prefactuals share this same functional characteristic...|$|E

40|$|In its severe critiąue of {{the content}} of the old tradition, postmodernism tends to avoid {{discussing}} the basic moment of this tradition, i. e. its theoretical attitude that {{is at the core of}} reflective rationality. More radical critiąue of rational reflection leads to a dichotomy bettveen theoretical and eiperiential thinking that grasp the main topics of contemporary philosophy in a deeper way. Therefore, a claim is made that virtual alternative for reflexive Western metaphysics should be sought in the direction of the philosophy of experience. It is found in the explication of philosophical hermeneutics in both its authorities - M. Heidegger and H. G. Gadamer. Experience, according to Gadamer, is an extremely wide concept that happens to be most undefined. Experience of scientific cognition is accumulated facts and empirical data that are later being used as material for a scientific experiment or any other research. Experience treated this way is only one of many steps of the scientific research: it prepares reflection that is scientific interpretation of these "meaningless" empirical facts and is a sole provider of the real cognition. This conception of experience is still encountered in the majority of postmodernist works that criticize the epoch of modernity.

40|$|The thesis, The Return of Christian Gnosticism. An Investigation of the Theology of Ulf Ekman, {{is divided}} into two main sections. In the first section I address the {{question}} of what can be seen as characteristic of modern Gnosticism. This section also performs a <b>preparatory</b> <b>function</b> for the second section which contains the primary focus of the thesis, namely an analysis of Ulf Ekman’s theology and an investigation as to whether this theology can be regarded as a modern expression of Gnostic ideas. The first section of the thesis thus creates a platform which is later used to provide answers for the questions found in the second section. In the final chapter of the thesis I shall also relate Ekman’s theology more generally to a neo-Gnostic intellectual climate. In the second section of the thesis I investigate the extent to which Ekman’s theology, which is closely related to international, primarily American, religious movements, contains veins of Gnosticism. I discuss in the background of ideas behind the American religious movement’s theology. Kenyon is reckoned to be the American movement’s founder and he is considered Ekman’s most significant spiritual father. I also discuss briefly how Gnostic thinking has contributed in various ways to the ideas of romanticism. I return to this theme in the concluding chapter of the thesis where I reflect on Gnostic traditions and ideas, and their presence in our culture. Then I present Ekman’s main theological thoughts. The focal point of the thesis is to what extent Ulf Ekman’s theology can be viewed as an expression of Christian neo-Gnosticism. The comparison that I draw in this section between Ekman’s theology and modern Gnosticism is based on the “Gnostic grammar” formulated in the first section. This comparison lies on a structural level, that is to say I compare {{the extent to which the}} fundamental thought structures in Ekman’s theology agree with the term modern Gnosticism as used in this thesis. This analysis is conducted under headings such as view of humanity; faith; salvation and knowledge; the cosmos and the world; dualism. I then discuss the results of the analysis and pose the question as to whether Ekman’s theology can be seen as being a modern, Christian Gnostic theology. There then follows a reflection over Ekman’s Christian Gnostic grammar. In the concluding chapter, the return of Christian Gnosticism, I widen the perspective by relating Ekman’s thinking to other, more general, cultural examples of Gnosticism such as the film The Matrix and the philosophy of James Redfield. I also discuss the issue of whether Ulf Ekman’s theology can be viewed as an expression of secularisation, if by secularisation one means Christian convictions permeating culture to an ever decreasing extent. This chapter also makes even clearer the historical connections, and their importance for the understanding of Ekman’s theology...|$|E
40|$|This text explores three {{developments}} {{pertaining to}} children and reading in seventeenth-century England. The author aims to show how profoundly death was implicated {{in the development of}} thought about children's reading {{as well as in the}} emergence of a literature for children in the early modem period. The first chapter discusses the negative reaction to the growing phenomenon of children reading romances and adventures in chapbook form. Escapist literature was believed to make one forget one's mortal lot, which in turn decreased one's motivation for piety. Through a discussion of the threat chapbook romances posed to pious reading, the chapter establishes the historical context for a related development, the creation of a religious or moralizing literature that children would find compelling. In their quest for gripping settings, authors latched on to the deathbed scene for its felicitous blend of inherent theatricality and religious resonance. By early seventeenth century, a few women writers even used the pretext of deathbed advice to pen their own conduct-of-life manuals in an otherwise male-dominated marketplace. The second chapter discusses the prefatory rhetoric used by the two most successful female writers in this genre. The remarkable success of maternal deathbed advice literature suggests that books in Protestant culture absorbed the near-superstitious value of Catholic icons and relics. The genre also implies a Protestant adaptation of the Catholic veneration of the mother. Comfort for the motherless child no longer came from prayer to Mary, but through the reading (and perhaps holding of) a book of advice by a model (and dead) Protestant mother. An analysis of the prefaces enables a close reading of the self-fashioningof model mother-authors. The third and final chapter discusses the starring role of death in the first English-language children's book, A Token for Children, by James Janeway. The chapter explores the literary interest in the early deaths of ordinary children of extraordinary piety. By reference to the doctrine of predestination, the author speculates that these books had a comforting as well as a <b>preparatory</b> <b>function,</b> allowing parents and children to rehearse (through reading) a model death of a child undoubtedly bound for Heaven. By no means a comprehensive treatment of the connections between death culture and children's reading in the early modern period, the thesis is intended to indicate how pious reading functioned as a reminder of one's mortality and a spur to self-scrutiny. The "looking glass" of the text displayed idealized and heaven-bound children and parents compared to whom the reader may have felt sorely in need of increased vigilance. by Heather Miller.

Discussion of the problems raised by this possibility and of the choice of biological material will be deferred until the data on growth are presented (Patterson, Dackerman, and Schultz, 1949).

Remarkably, the contrary is considered elusive and, indeed, many authors have tried to obtain wave mechanics starting from other alternative frameworks of classical mechanics (for instance, Hamilton-Jacobi theory). Despite this common opinion, we present here a simple method to make Newtonian dynamics develop naturally into Schrodinger representation.

First, the role of classical density functions is underlined in view of their use to define constants of the motion for massive particles.

The resulting wave equation is defined in dependence on a parameter that plays the identical role of the constant K introduced by Schrodinger in the original formulation of his theory. In the final step, the classical wave equation is treated under the hypothesis of conservative forces common to the Eherenfest theorem and, after some algebra, the Schrodinger equation emerges by means of the identification of the classical momentum with de Broglie momentum of matter waves.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{a theory of}} self-directed {{learning}} is presented based on social constructivistic starting points. Social constructivism focuses on the exchange of perspectives on reality between {{people who are willing}} to maintain and strengthen each other's identities. For learning this means that perspectives and perspective taking are important processes in learning. Moreover collective meaning construction is essential. Learning is described as a social-interactive, contextual, constructive, self-regulated and reflective process. The theory focuses on three kinds of learning <b>functions</b> (<b>preparatory,</b> executive and closing) as building blocks that can be used in three different ways: in guided environments, in self-directed learning and in situations where learning is a side effect of other activities only. Learning functions are psychological processes and activities that people execute when learning, be it consciously or unconsciously. The three ways to learn (guided, self-directed, unconsciously) are described as three different ways to organize the same learning functions in different ways. We describe the success factors for these three ways to learn. Skills of self-directed learning are also different for the three ways to learn. In guided environments, skills of learner control consist mostly of executive learning functions. The skills for self-directed learning (or action learning in working situations) are described next. Here the preparatory and closing learning functions tend to dominate. Finally, skills of experiential learning are described. In this way of learning the key skill is to design and look for environments that may lead to unconscious forms of learning where the learning functions follow from action automatically...|$|R
