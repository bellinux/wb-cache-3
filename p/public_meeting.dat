40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 Despite their {{potential}} democratic value, <b>public</b> <b>meetings</b> between citizens and officeholders are poorly understood sites of political participation and community planning. Although {{there has been}} a recent rise in scholarly and practical attention paid to citizens in <b>public</b> <b>meetings,</b> officeholders' accounts and practices have been largely ignored. Given the stake that public officials have in meetings with citizens, and the effects that their contributions may have on meetings' procedures and outcomes, it is important to inform our understandings of <b>public</b> <b>meetings</b> by acknowledging and describing officeholders' experiences. This project approaches <b>public</b> <b>meetings</b> from a deliberative democratic perspective, which values communicative interaction as the underlying constitutive force of democratic organizations. Recognizing the prevalence of expressive and competitive public discourses in American politics, a deliberative democratic approach focuses concern on how potentially synthetic kinds of talk, like deliberation and dialogue, play out in political speech situations. This dissertation's most basic assumption is that <b>public</b> <b>meetings</b> between citizens and officeholders provide contexts in which deliberation and dialogue may flourish. The project's empirical dimension features case studies of three government-initiated <b>public</b> <b>meetings.</b> The research applies descriptive methods that cohere with the ethnography of speaking approach, and which include participant-observation and interviews with participating and facilitating officeholders. Case reports describe and discuss the contexts in which meetings take place, the kinds and qualities of talk that participants enact, and officeholders' senses of motivations, purposes, roles, relationships, constraints, opportunities, outcomes, and so on. The fundamental research goal is to respond to the general question, What are some {{of the ways in which}} <b>public</b> <b>meetings</b> [...] -particularly deliberative <b>public</b> <b>meetings</b> [...] -might take place given our civic milieu and the practical experiences of officeholders...|$|R

5|$|The Town of Christchurch {{by-election}} in 1860 {{was triggered}} by the resignation of Richard Packer as the Member of the House of Representatives for the Town of Christchurch electorate, and occurred during the term of the 2nd New Zealand Parliament. The previous representative of the electorate, the politician Henry Sewell, had returned after three years in England and the general expectation was that Sewell would be the sole contender for election. The Lyttelton Times wrote several provocative editorials, generally endorsing Sewell for his obvious ability, but criticising him for not publicly talking about his policies and plans. Sewell eventually arranged a <b>public</b> <b>meeting</b> the evening prior to nomination day; {{this was the only}} <b>public</b> <b>meeting</b> during the election campaign. After a lengthy address, which was favourably received by the Lyttelton Times, a second contender for the office put his name forward at that meeting: the publican Michael Hart. Sewell, a former premier and one of New Zealand's most senior politicians at the time, was successful against the political novice Hart.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} local railway {{was still}} of {{interest}} to the people of Anglesey. A <b>public</b> <b>meeting</b> was held in Llangefni on 5 July 1858, to popularise the idea of building a railway leaving the main line at Gaerwen, running north to Amlwch, west to Cemaes Bay, then south through Llanrhyddlad to rejoin the main line at Valley. This ambitious scheme did not gain enough support to proceed, although some landowners offered to exchange land for shares.|$|E

5|$|A <b>public</b> <b>meeting</b> in February 1919 {{established}} a consensus {{to create a}} monument and a fund {{for the families of}} wounded servicemen. The meeting agreed to commission Lutyens to design the monument. His design for a bridge over the River Roch was abandoned after a local dignitary purchased a plot of land adjacent to Rochdale Town Hall and donated it for the site of the memorial. Lutyens revised his design and Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, unveiled the memorial on 26 November 1922. It is a Grade I listed structure, having been upgraded in 2015 when Lutyens' war memorials were declared a national collection.|$|E
5|$|Cross-river traffic {{increased}} {{following the}} establishment of the Royal Arsenal in 1671. To enable movement of troops and supplies, the army established its own ferry in 1810. The following year an Act of Parliament established a commercial ferry company, but it was dissolved in 1844. In 1846 the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway extended its lines to include a Thames wharf branch; eventually three steam ferries operated, but they proved inadequate to meet the growing demand. In October 1880 a <b>public</b> <b>meeting</b> was held in Woolwich to discuss setting up a locally run steam-ferry service, but the cost was seen as prohibitive.|$|E
5|$|First {{offered in}} 1946 in the Sandusky area and later {{expanded}} to serve Erie, Huron, Lorain, and Ottawa counties, extension programs established {{a foundation for}} BGSU Firelands, the university's regional campus.

In 2003, Cedar Point Center opened its doors on the Firelands campus. The facility houses a 450-seat divisible <b>public</b> <b>meeting</b> area, smaller conference rooms, a cyber cafe, multimedia classrooms, and two distance learning classrooms.

5|$|Following Malvern's new-found fame as a spa {{and area}} of natural beauty, and fully {{exploiting}} its new rail connections, factories {{from as far}} as Manchester were organising day trips for their employees, often attracting as many as 5,000visitors a day. In 1865, a <b>public</b> <b>meeting</b> of residents denounced the rising rail fares– by then twice that of other lines– that were exploiting the tourism industry, and demanded a limitation {{to the number of}} excursion trains. The arrival of the railway also enabled the delivery of coal in large quantities, which accelerated the area's popularity as a winter resort.|$|E

The following month, the Whig government introduced the Bill for the Abolition of Slavery, formally saluting Wilberforce in the process. On 26 July 1833, Wilberforce heard of government concessions that guaranteed {{the passing of the}} Bill for the Abolition of Slavery. The following day he grew much weaker, and he died early on the morning of 29 July at his cousin's house in Cadogan Place, London.|$|E

However, they begin to internally fight over other ideas such as having theaters for shadow puppets and a broccoli juice program, and their wildly unpopular plans at a <b>public</b> <b>meeting</b> (including the banning of all contact sports and Comic Book Guy's plan to limit breeding to every 7 years) further expose the rifts inside the group.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} sparse {{through most of}} the life of the railway. In 1905, three trains per day ran from Goole to Haxey Junction and back, with a {{separate}} train operating on the Fockerby Branch. By November, only the morning and evening train ran, except on Wednesdays. A coal strike in 1912 resulted in all services being withdrawn except on Wednesdays and Saturdays for a period of three weeks. At a <b>public</b> <b>meeting</b> held in October 1920, users complained about the poor service and the lack of trucks to carry goods. The chairman of the Isle of Axholme Rural District Council was particularly exasperated by the fact that the trains arrived at Haxey Junction shortly after the trains on the other line had departed.|$|E
