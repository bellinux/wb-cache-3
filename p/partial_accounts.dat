We compare measures of semantic neighborhood density derived from three distinct semantic representations: elicited features, associations, and text-based co-occurrence measures and examine whether embellishments such as frequency-weighting and distinctiveness-weighting improve measures of semantic neighborhood density. According to some metrics, responses are faster and more accurate in dense semantic neighborhoods, but other metrics show exactly the opposite pattern. We propose that distant neighbors facilitate semantic access but near neighbors inhibit semantic access...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is shown how a partial {{semantics}} for presuppositions {{can be given}} which is empirically more satisfactory than its predecessors, and how this semantics can be integrated with a technically sound, compositional grammar in the Montagovian fashion. Additionally, {{it is argued that}} the classical objection to <b>partial</b> <b>accounts</b> of presupposition projection, namely that they lack `flexibility', is based on a misconception. Partial logics can give rise to flexible predictions without postulating any ad hoc ambiguities.

40|$|The {{concept of}} faith is {{important}} {{both in the}} philosophy of religion and in religious practice. Faith—or at least religious faith—has been widely conceived as a kind of virtue. Both concepts play important roles in major theological and ethical traditions; but, for certain purposes, both can be best clarified by abstracting from highly specific contexts, such as those of the New Testament and Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics. The paper examines many important relationships between faith and virtue. Doing this requires at least <b>partial</b> <b>accounts</b> of both virtue and faith. Providing these accounts is facilitated by A consideration of faithfulness—a kind of fidelity—in relation to both concepts helps to provide the needed accounts of virtue and faith.

I want to go beyond <b>partial</b> <b>accounts</b> of this structure in terms of cross-situational consistency coefficients and estimated percentages of variance accounted for by person-situation interactions. For this purpose I propose a small set of empirically testable questions that underlie a basic typology of contextualized individual differences structures.

Tools from the two-mode clustering domain (old as well as recently proposed ones) can be used to detect the type of individual differences structure that constitutes the gist of a person by situation data set at hand.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{dominant}} perspectives for understanding e-democracy in practice. It argues that although these, on their own, only provide static and <b>partial</b> <b>accounts</b> {{of the role}} and implications of e-democracy, nevertheless {{they should not be}} disregarded. The paper proposes an integration of their key positions to generate a more rounded and complete account of the role of e-democracy in practice. It suggests that Giddens's Structuration Theory provides a starting point in this direction. A structuration perspective is able to integrate many of the diverse perspectives whilst simultaneously avoiding technological and social determinism by focusing attention on the interplay of social structures and agency in e-democracy practices. This perspective assists in illuminating the underlying institutional arrangements and structures in which e-democracy practices are embedded, as well as the strategies employed by human actors. It focuses attention on structures of signification, domination and legitimation that surround e-democracy practices and also how individuals are both enabled and constrained in these practices. It is argued that more complete and balanced accounts which emerge from such an integrated perspective could assist in developing a more effective e-democracy policy...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{centrality}} of managing diversity effectively in contemporary organizations, existing literature gives disparate and incomplete accounts of how managers actually manage diversity in practice. The prevailing managerial literature focuses on what diversity activities {{should be involved in}} managing diversity but does not identify how managers actually undertake these activities in practice. The growing interpretive/critical literature focuses on how people's understandings define managing diversity, but is silent on how managers translate their understandings into specific diversity activities in practice. We applied a practice perspective in conjunction with phenomenography as a methodological approach to investigate how managers actually manage diversity in practice in the empirical context of professional services firms. The results show that managers' practice of managing diversity is constituted by four understandings of managing diversity that distinguish and organize diversity activities into four different and progressively more comprehensive ways of managing diversity. This practice-theoretical account transcends the existing literature's <b>partial</b> <b>accounts</b> in significant ways by offering a new and considerably broader and more precise conceptualization of managers' practice of managing diversity, including which ways of managing diversity may be more effective than others.

40|$|We argue {{two major}} {{difficulties}} in current discourses of citizenship education.

The second is in failing to understand the discursive and material support for citizenship activity. We, thus, {{argue that it is}} not a lack of citizenship that education research might address, but identification and exploration of the different forms of citizenship that students already engage in. We offer a fragmentary, poststructuralist theorization oriented to explore the ‘contemporary limits of the necessary', drawing on specific resources from the work of Michel Foucault and others for the constitution of local, <b>partial</b> <b>accounts</b> of citizenship discourses and activities, and exploration of their possibilities and constraints. We argue this as a significant tactic of theorization in support of an opening of discourses of citizenship and in avoiding the discursive difficulties that we have identified. Our theorization, then, is significant in its potential to unsettle discourses that confine contemporary thought regarding citizenship education and support exploration of what might be excessive to that confinement...|$|E

40|$|For {{many years}} Teresa de Ávila’s Libro de la vida was {{considered}} an exceptional work of literature, in both senses of the word “exceptional”. The work of Isabelle Poutrin, Francisco Durán López and others has made us question one of these meanings: no one doubts Teresa’s great literary value, but {{we now know that}} hers is one of hundreds (if not more) spiritual autobiographies/diaries kept by early modern Spanish women (and a few men as well). None of these lesser known vidas are as comprehensive or polished as Teresa’s Vida, and many are fragmentary and even incoherent. Insofar as these <b>partial</b> <b>accounts</b> of spiritual graces have been studied or translated, they are often excerpted, paraphrased, or translated {{in such a way as}} to make them more legible than, I argue, they really are. I propose then to consider how we might integrate these failed (in the sense that their authors’ spiritual narratives were never deemed models for others), fragmentary, incomplete, and incoherent narratives into the study of the “spiritual autobiography”. This chapter will examine a selection of such autobiographies to make the argument that, by examining a more complete corpus of spiritual autobiographies, and not just the most polished and successful ones, we get a different and fuller picture of the possibilities and limits of women’s self-fashioning through language in the early modern period...|$|E
