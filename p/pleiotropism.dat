40|$|Intrinsic {{mortality}} {{at relatively}} advanced age results from natural selection favouring early reproduction. When individuals produce many and early offspring, costs are incurred {{due to the}} accumulation of pleiotropic mutations with adverse effects late in life, which make senescence an inevitable result of evolution. However, a few organisms exist with seemingly indefinite generation lengths. This paper identifies conditions of life history and ecology under which natural selection favours continually reducing intrinsic mortality. The analysis considers the particular case of populations held at carrying capacity by density dependence suppressing net fertility, acting either on fecundity equally across fecund ages or on juvenile mortality {{up to the first}} fecund age. This broad category of density dependence increases the susceptibility of populations to invasion by mutations that extend net fertility into later life. Whether a population then evolves longer generation times depends on the relative timing of period benefit to onset of senescent cost amongst antagonistic <b>pleiotropisms</b> that arise to confront the selection process. Simulations show that if the onset of senescent costs either precedes the benefit, is concurrent with it, or is postponed by a fixed interval, then natural selection will favour those <b>pleiotropisms</b> that increase generation length. The selection on generation-lengthening <b>pleiotropisms</b> continues indefinitely and regardless of current generation length, {{for as long as the}} environment remains constant. The wide range of life histories encompassed by these conditions leads to the conclusion that many species may have evolved generation lengths considerably longer than the minimum set by developmental constraints...|$|R
40|$|Chlorophyll {{content is}} {{positively}} correlated with photosynthetic rate. However, {{little is known about}} the genetic correlation between grain yield and chlorophyll content in the same wheat mapping population. The primary goal of the study was to detect the genetic basis of grain yield and chlorophyll content and their possible roles in the genetic improvement of grain yield in wheat. Here, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain yield and chlorophyll content were studied using a set of 168 doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from a cross between two elite Chinese wheat cultivars, Huapei 3 ×Yumai 57. The DH population and parents were evaluated for grain yield and chlorophyll content in three environments. A total of 11 additive QTLs and 6 pairs of epistatic QTLs were detected for grain yield and chlorophyll content. Loci, such as Xcfd 53, Xwmc 718, and Xwmc 215 on chromosomes (e. g. 2 D, 4 A, and 5 D) simultaneously controling grain yield and chlorophyll content, showed tight linkages or <b>pleiotropisms.</b> Three novel major QTLs, qGY 5 D, qChla 5 D, and qChlb 5 D, closely linked with the PCR marker Xwmc 215 on chromosome 5 D, accounted for 10. 32...|$|R
40|$|The {{coexistence}} of different color morphs is often attributed to variable selection pressures across space, time, morph frequencies or selection agents, but the routes by which each morph is favored are rarely identified. In {{this study we}} untangle the interactions and trait <b>pleiotropisms</b> that influence floral color polymorphisms on a local scale in Protea, within which ~ 40 % of species are polymorphic. Previous work shows that seed predators and reproductive differences likely influence polymorphism maintenance in four Protea species. Here, we explore whether selection acts on floral color directly or indirectly in Protea aurea, using path analysis of pollinator behavior, nectar production, seed predation, color, morphology, and fitness measures. We found that avian pollinators spent more time on white morphs, likely due to nectar differences, but this had no apparent consequences for fecundity. Instead, a single continuous trait underpinned many of the reproductively-important differences between color morphs: the number of flowers per flowerhead. This trait differed between color morphs (white had more), {{and it was also}} positively correlated with nectar, seed predation, and fecundity independent of predation. Realized fecundity, in contrast, was not directly associated with color or any other floral trait, although it covaried with leaf chlorophyll content, which was higher in white morphs. Thus, although conflicting selection via predation and higher reproductive potential may promote color polymorphism in Protea aurea, the phenotypes targeted by selection are more strongly associated with the number of flowers per head, leaf chlorophyll content, and their unmeasured correlates, rather than with flowerhead color itself...|$|R

40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects on embryonic and gametophytic development of two nonallelic defective-kernel mutants of maize. Earlier studies indicated that both mutants are abnormal in embryonic morphogenesis {{as well as in}} the formation of their endosperm. Mutant rgh*- 1210 embryos depart from the normal embryogenic pathway at the proembryo and transition stage, by developing meristematic lobes and losing bilateral symmetry. They continue growth as irregular cell masses that enlarge and become necrotic. Somatic embryos arising in rgh*- 1210 callus cultures display the rgh*- 1210 mutant phenotype. Mutant fl*- 1253 B embryos are variably blocked from the coleoptilar stage through stage 2. Following formation of the shoot apex in the mutant embryos the leaf primordia and tissues surrounding the embryonic axis continue growth and cell division, while the scutellum ceases development and becomes hypertrophied. Mutant fl*- 1253 B embryos are unable to germinate, either in mutant kernels or as immature embryos in culture, and the mutant scutellar tissue does not produce regenerable callus. Expression of the fl*- 1253 B locus during male gametophytic development is revealed by a marked reduction in pollen transmission as a result of mutant expression during the interval between meiosis and the initiation of pollen tube growth. In both mutants, there is considerable proliferation of the aleurone cells of the endosperm. Mutant expression of rgh*- 1210 in the female gametophyte is revealed by the abnormal antipodal cells of the embryo sac. These results show that these two gene loci play unique and crucial roles in normal morphogenesis of the embryo. In addition, it is evident that both mutants are pleiotropic in affecting the development of the endosperm and gametophyte as well as the embryo. These <b>pleiotropisms</b> suggest some commonality in the gene regulation of development in these three tissues...|$|R
50|$|Often, the {{advantages}} and disadvantages conveyed are rather complicated, because more than one gene may influence a given trait or morph.

50|$|Promptov {{was born}} in the family of a {{high-ranking}} Russian revenue official. He went to school in Kostroma and graduated from the Nechaev gymnasium in Moscow. Even as a young boy, he took an interest in birds but he chose to study experimental zoology rather than ornithology. It is thought that his choice may have been aided by family ties to Nikolai Koltsov. Promptov's and Koltsov's mothers were related and Koltsov influenced the authorities to let Promptov study the genetics of fowl under Aleksandr Serebrovskii, a former student of Koltsov, in a project funded by the People's Commissariat of Agriculture. Promptov graduated in 1923 and joined the University in the department of genetics. He contributed to a translation of T.H. Morgan's Physical Basis of Heredity into Russian and joined Sergei Chetverikov's research team working on Drosophila. In 1926 he started research at Moscow University's Institute of Zoology on <b>pleiotropism</b> and polymorphism in Drosophila genetics. Throughout this period, he continued to take an interest in field ornithology and began to explore many aspects of avian biology including song learning and hybridization of finches. After defending his dissertation in 1929 he made a trip to the Urals to study song variation in several bird species. Returning after two months, he took up a job of a lecturer in general biology. He gradually intensified his studies in ornithology and in 1937 he produced a 400 page manual of field ornithology, Птицы в природе ("birds in nature") which is still considered a classic. It included calls described in his own notations. Promptov also pioneered bird sound recording in the USSR with an instrument that made use of photographic film. In 1940 he moved to an Ornithological Laboratory at the Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Pathology of Higher Nervous Activity which had been established in Koltushi by Ivan Pavlov and then directed by his student Leon Orbeli. He began to study species specific stereotyped behaviour in birds but the war broke out. Promptov stayed at the Institute through the war and after the war, he was visited by Julian Huxley who reported that it was the only work on the genetics of behaviour in wild birds that he knew of. On November 11, 1948 Promptov committed suicide. Some of his work was posthumously published by his wife Elizaveta Lukina (who was also a research collaborator).|$|E

40|$|Cancer cells contain {{genetic damage}} of two sorts (Bishop 1991) : dominant, with targets known as proto-oncogenes; and recessive, with targets known most {{commonly}} as tumor suppressor genes. The lesions in proto-oncogenes cause an unwanted gain of function, whereas {{the damage to}} tumor suppressor genes typical-ly causes loss of function. Proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are generally thought of as governors of cellular proliferation, with the former serving as accelerators, the latter as brakes. Jam an accelerator or remove a brake, and the cell is unleashed to relentless division. Useful as this view may be, it is erroneously simplistic. In reality, many proto-oncogenes and at least some tumor suppressor genes have diverse, even paradoxical functions that vary with cellular and phys-iological context: There is plasticity in the machine. Until we can understand the nature and genesis of that plasticity, {{it is unlikely that}} we will be able to fully understand the biochemical maladies of cancer cells.

40|$|Vitamin D {{receptor}} (VDR) is {{a nuclear}} hormone receptor {{that acts as}} a transcriptional regulator in response to circulating 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D 3, the active hormonal form of vitamin D. VDR gene polymorphism (VDRGP) have been extensively studied in different diseases, with over 700 primary research articles, although this has focused mainly on the same markers. The VDRGP experience, with its huge literature and appearance of apparently contradictory reports each month, may provide an example of what to expect with other genes in the growing field of analysis of common gene polymorphisms with complex common disorders. Morita et al. provide a typical example of a moderately sized population study of the relationship of VDRGP to bone density and rate of bone loss in Japanese. 1 Reviewing the VDRGP literature {{is beyond the scope of}} this commentary which will only refer to a limited number of publications. For those interested, Zmuda et al. provide two comprehensive reviews of the literature of VDR related to disease. 2, 3 Suffice to say that VDRGP have shown positive association to a wide range of divergent diseases, and due to the pleiotropic mode of action of a nuclear-hormone receptor such as the VDR, plausible molecular scenarios of involvement can be constructed for many different diseases. In fact, if functional genetic polymorphism occurs in a transcriptional regulator, one should expect <b>pleiotropism,</b> due to the fact that VDR controls the expression of a large and unknown number of subordinate genes, in both positive and negative senses and in cell-specific manners. The VDR protein is at the centre of the vitamin D endocrine system, a complex physiological system with substantial feedback regulatory mechanisms involved in maintaining serum calcium and 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D 3 within narrow bounds and now known to affect a large number of organs. 4 It is possible that the self-regulatory nature of the VDR endocrine system moderates the effect of VDRGP. VDR gene polymorphisms are looking for phenotypes, and judging from the literature, are related to numerous different traits, reflecting <b>pleiotropism.</b> Therefore, although literature has accumulated concerning VDR and bone mineral density (BMD) in particular, this may not necessarily be the most potent effect of genetic variation in VDR.

The most promising approach, however, is from rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). Chen et al. (1993) reported a new recessive GMS line (9012 A) in which the sterility is conditioned by two recessive genes and an epistatic suppression gene (esp). Later, they successfully developed it into a ‘three-line’ system (i.e. sterile line, temporary maintainer line and restorer line), which is as effective as traditional CMS system for massive hybrid seed production (Chen and Hu 1998 [...]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Tumor {{heterogeneity}} is {{a confusing}} {{finding in the}} assessment of neoplasms, potentially resulting in inaccurate diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tests. This tumor heterogeneity is not always a random and unpredictable phenomenon, whose knowledge helps designing better tests. The biologic reasons for this intratumoral heterogeneity would then be important to understand both the natural history of neoplasms and the selection of test samples for reliable analysis. The main factors contributing to intratumoral heterogeneity inducing gene abnormalities or modifying its expression include: the gradient ischemic level within neoplasms, the action of tumor microenvironment (bidirectional interaction between tumor cells and stroma), mechanisms of intercellular transference of genetic information (exosomes), and differential mechanisms of sequence-independent modifications of genetic material and proteins. The intratumoral heterogeneity is at the origin of tumor progression and it is also the byproduct of the selection process during progression. Any analysis of heterogeneity mechanisms must be integrated within the process of segregation of genetic changes in tumor cells during the clonal expansion and progression of neoplasms. The evaluation of these mechanisms must also consider the redundancy and <b>pleiotropism</b> of molecular pathways, for which appropriate surrogate markers would support the presence or not of heterogeneous genetics and the main mechanisms responsible. This knowledge would constitute a solid scientific background for future therapeutic planning...|$|E
