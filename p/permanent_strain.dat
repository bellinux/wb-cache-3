The influence of stress level, water content, density, and compaction method (vibrating hammer or vibrocompaction) was analyzed. Tests with one cyclic stress level on one specimen (single stage loading) and tests with several cyclic stress levels on the same specimen (multi-stage loading) were performed, in order to evaluate the prediction capability of the multi-stage loading test. The latter test procedure is quicker and more practical. Although the <b>permanent</b> <b>strains</b> obtained by the two test procedures were different, the multi-stage loading method did indicate the trend of the long-term behavior of the material.

The testing of the elements was carried out according to EC 3, chapter 9, “Testing Procedure”, because the elements are classified as cold-rolled thin-gauge profiles as stated in Romanian Norm NP 012 - 92 (EC 3 parts 1 - 3). The testing procedure consisted of several repeated loading–unloading cycles. Finally, one specimen from each class was loaded until collapsed. The local buckling of the edge ribs caused {{the collapse of the}} profiles (in reality this is impossible because the steel sheets are coupled). The ultimate deflections are limited according to several Norms between L/ 100 and L/ 200.

5000|$|The next crucial {{stage is}} load application. This {{issue has been}} widely {{investigated}} {{but there is no}} loading path universally adopted by the testing laboratories. It has to be said that the loading cycles mainly depend on the scope of the test and it is unrealistic to consider the possibility of elaborating a single loading path able to fulfil at the same time all the requirements imposed by the investigation of the initial behaviour, the service behaviour, the behaviour at breaking load and long term behaviour. This part of the procedure should provide a valid approach to the establishment of a load profile, describing the effects of the parameters involved, in order to fully investigate the material response according to the required repeatability.Since coated fabrics do not follow an elastic behaviour, once the stress is removed the sample maintains a certain level of <b>permanent</b> <b>strain,</b> a plastic deformation. This behaviour is known as residual strain and is present both in monoaxial and biaxial tests. The main value of residual strain is shown {{between the first and second}} load cycle, decreasing to zero after a number of cycles that depends on the material properties, the applied load and the time for which it has been applied. This is due to the creep of the yarns and the coating material and to the internal frictional effects. In order to obtain a realistic description of the material the strain should be measured within a unique load cycle, assuming equal to zero the strain at pre-stress. For this reason the loading cycle considered for the strain measure is generally preceded by identical cycles in a number sufficient to stabilise the sample response. In order to remove the residual strain previous researches considered adequate the application of five identical loading and unloading cycles, the TensiNet design guide consider three or five repetitions to be sufficient, depending on the testing protocol. While the Membrane Structures Association of Japan [...] prescribes the repetition of the cycles three times, but only for the 1:1 load ratio which separates the others. This offers several advantages in the comparison of readings carried out within the same test and with other tests.|$|E

Evaluation {{of the results of the}} laboratory study on shear response of the overlay mixes reported herein included the effects of mix temperatures, air-void content, aging, mixing and compaction conditions, aggregate gradation, and shear stress level. Shear testing was performed to assess expected rutting performance at high temperatures. Mixes with five binders were tested, namely AR 4000, asphalt rubber, and three modified binders termed MB 4 (meeting the Caltrans MB 4 specification [2003]), MB 15 (meeting the MB 4 specification and containing 15 percent recycled tire rubber, referred to as MAC 15), and MAC 15 TR (Southern California GreenBook specification, containing 15 percent recycled tire rubber, referred to as MAC 15). A full factorial considering all the variables required a total of 2, 880 tests. This was reduced to 186 tests to accommodate time and fund constraints. Based on the shear test results for the mixes used in the overlay experiment, mix rankings for Cycles to 5 Percent <b>Permanent</b> Shear <b>Strain,</b> <b>Permanent</b> Shear <b>Strain</b> at 5, 000 Cycles, and Resilient Shear Modulus (G*) were: • <b>Permanent</b> Shear <b>Strain</b> at 5, 000 Cycles (best performance to worst) : AR 4000 -D; MAC 15 -G; RAC-G; MB 4 -G; MB 15 -G. • Cycles to 5 Percent <b>Permanent</b> Shear <b>Strain</b> (best performance to worst) : AR 4000 -D; MAC 15 -G; RAC-G; MB 4 -G; MB 15 -G. • Resilient Shear Modulus (G*) (stiffest to least stiff) : AR 4000 -D; RAC-G; MAC 15 -G; MB 4 -G; MB 15 -G The results show that the rankings of different mixes for expected rutting performance are the same for the two permanent deformation parameters calculated from Repeated Simple Shear Test (RSST) results: <b>Permanent</b> Shear <b>Strain</b> at 5, 000 Cycles and Cycles to 5 Percent <b>Permanent</b> Shear <b>Strain.</b> The RSST demonstrated that the densegraded mix with unmodified AR- 4000 asphalt performed better than the gap-graded mixes with modified binders.
