5|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that at the}} time, the <b>pass</b> of Thermopylae {{consisted}} of a track along {{the shore of the}} Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could <b>pass</b> through at a time. In fact, as noted below, the <b>pass</b> was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian hordes. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defenses of the <b>pass</b> by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the <b>pass,</b> Herodotus describes how the Gauls who fell into the marsh disappeared and were drowned.|$|E

5|$|The column {{had yet to}} {{run into}} any American troops when they reached Howard's Tavern (also known as Howard's Half-Way House), {{just a few hundred}} yards from the Jamaica <b>Pass.</b> Tavern keeper William Howard and his son William Jr. were forced to act as guides to show the British the way to the Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the Jamaica <b>Pass</b> to the west (located today in the Cemetery of the Evergreens). Five minutes after leaving the tavern, the five American militia {{officers}} stationed at the <b>pass</b> were captured without a shot fired, as they thought that the British were Americans. Clinton interrogated the men and they informed him that they were the only troops guarding the <b>pass.</b> By dawn, the British were through the <b>pass</b> and stopped so that the troops could rest. At 09:00, they fired two heavy cannons to signal the Hessian troops below Battle <b>Pass</b> to begin their frontal assault against Sullivan's men deployed on the two hills flanking the <b>pass,</b> while Clinton's troops simultaneously flanked the American positions from the east.|$|E
