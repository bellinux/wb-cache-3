5|$|A {{more serious}} fictional {{portrayal}} of McCarthy <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> {{role in the}} 1959 novel The Manchurian Candidate by Richard Condon. The character of Senator John Iselin, a demagogic anti-communist, is closely modeled on McCarthy, even to the varying numbers of Communists he asserts are employed by the federal government. He remains a major character in the 1962 film version.|$|E
5|$|Clements {{was elected}} to the Kentucky Senate in 1941, {{representing}} Union, Webster, and Henderson counties. By 1944, he had risen to the post of majority leader in that body and <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> role in writing the state's budget that year. Due to Clements' efforts, educational appropriations were increased far above what had been called for by Republican governor Simeon Willis.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the ships}} were poorly armored {{compared}} to foreign designs in general, the ships' underwater protection {{was the greatest}} weakness in the armor scheme. The torpedo bulkhead was placed {{too close to the}} outer hull, which reduced its ability to absorb damage. This weakness <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> role in the loss of both Espa√±a to grounding in 1923 and the sinking of Alfonso XIII by a single mine in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are an {{important}} natural means of transferring genes between different species, which increases genetic diversity and drives evolution.

5|$|Between April 1947 and December 1948, when George C. Marshall was Secretary of State, Kennan {{was more}} {{influential}} {{than he was}} at any other period in his career. Marshall valued his strategic sense and had him create and direct what is now named the Policy Planning Staff, the State Department's internal think tank. Kennan became the first Director of Policy Planning. Marshall relied heavily on him to prepare policy recommendations. Kennan <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> role in the drafting of the Marshall Plan.|$|E

Friend, a faculty member in Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology, <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> role in planning the iconography. It was built by Matthews Construction Company, which worked on several projects on Princeton's campus. Among those who contributed to the design of stained glass windows were Charles Connick, Henry Lee Willet (of the studio that would become Willet Hauser), and Philadelphia-based stained glass artist Nicola d'Ascenzo.|$|E
5|$|Education of {{the young}} was never {{considered}} to be the primary domain of schools, even after they had become more common. Most education was carried out by a child's parents or foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> role in a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.|$|E

In 1941, he helped establish the American-based Economic History Association and its Journal of Economic History. He later became the association's second president. Innis <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> role in founding two important sources for the funding of academic research: the Canadian Social Science Research Council (1940) and the Humanities Research Council of Canada (1944).|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{prescription}} for strong public investment had ties to {{his interest in}} uncertainty. Keynes had given a unique perspective on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, years before his major economic works. Keynes thought strong public investment and fiscal policy would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of economic fluctuations can have on the economy. While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty may have <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E

5|$|Night market: The {{concept of}} the night market traces its roots back to the medieval Chinese Tang dynasty. The Tang {{government}} put strict sanctions on night markets and their operations in A.D. 836. Towards {{the end of the}} Tang Dynasty, economic expansion led to less state regulation and restrictions being lifted on night markets. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), Night markets <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> role in medieval Chinese nightlife. These markets were found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours. Song period night markets are also known to have included restaurants and brothels due to being frequently located near business and red light districts.|$|E
5|$|Palmer {{traveled}} to the Oregon Country in 1845. He <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> role in blazing {{the last leg of}} the Oregon Trail, the Barlow Road, with Sam Barlow and others. Specifically, Palmer is noted for having climbed high on Mount Hood to observe the surrounding area when the party ran into difficulty. He wrote a popular immigrant guidebook, co-founded Dayton, Oregon, and served as a controversial Indian Affairs administrator. After Oregon became a state, Palmer served in both branches of the Oregon Legislative Assembly. He was selected as Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives for one session in 1862, and in 1870 lost a bid to become Governor of Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{of affairs}} did not {{surround}} only Bigge. In 1890, the sculptor Joseph Edgar Boehm died in Louise's presence at his studio in London, leading to rumours {{that the two}} were having an affair. Boehm's assistant, Alfred Gilbert, who <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> role in comforting Louise after Boehm's death, and supervised the destruction of Boehm's private papers, was rapidly promoted as a royal sculptor. Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master. However, Jehanne Wake, Louise's biographer, argues {{that there is no}} substantial evidence to suggest that Louise had sexual relationships with anyone other than her husband.|$|E

5|$|Taiko have a mythological {{origin in}} Japanese folklore, but {{historical}} records suggest that taiko {{were introduced to}} Japan through Korean and Chinese cultural influence {{as early as the}} 6th century CE. Some taiko are similar to instruments originating from India. Archaeological evidence also supports that taiko were present in Japan during the 6th century in the Kofun period. Their function has varied through history, ranging from communication, military action, theatrical accompaniment, and religious ceremony to both festival and concert performances. In modern times, taiko have also <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> role in social movements for minorities both within and outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|A {{pioneering}} {{work of the}} fantasy genre was The King of Elfland's Daughter, a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> role in Tolkien's legendarium, notably The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language {{similar to those in}} Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which featured not only in novels but also role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons) are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as well. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.|$|E
5|$|Australians <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>central</b> {{role in the}} New Guinea {{campaign}} during 1942 and 1943. After {{an attempt}} to land troops at Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay. Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the Kokoda Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay {{with the support of}} the RAAF and USAAF. Australian and US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard-fought Battle of Buna-Gona. The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of Wau in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the Salamaua-Lae campaign in April. In late 1943, the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation Cartwheel, when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the Huon Peninsula during the Huon Peninsula campaign and Finisterre Range campaign.|$|E
