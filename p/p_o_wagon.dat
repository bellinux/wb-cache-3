40|$|Abstract Background Oral (<b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> {{chemotherapy}} treatments gained increasing {{importance in}} the palliative treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Aim of this survey was to evaluate the acceptance of <b>p.</b> <b>o.</b> treatment and patients' individual attitudes towards it. Methods A specific 14 item-questionnaire was designed. Patients suffering from breast cancer receiving a newly launched <b>p.</b> <b>o.</b> or i. v. chemotherapy treatment were prospectively evaluated during 4 months of time. 224 questionnaires using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, Spearman correlation were evaluated. Results Patients' median age was 54 years, 164 received i. v., 60 <b>p.</b> <b>o</b> therapy. 89 % with <b>p.</b> <b>o.</b> and 67 % with i. v. regimens would choose <b>p.</b> <b>o.</b> over i. v. therapy, if equal efficacy is guaranteed. Significant differences were especially found in terms of personal benefit (55 % i. v., 92 % <b>p.</b> <b>o.),</b> reduced feeling of being ill due to <b>p.</b> <b>o.</b> treatment (26 % i. v., 65 % <b>p.</b> <b>o.),</b> better coping with disease due to <b>p.</b> <b>o.</b> therapy (36 % i. v., 68 % <b>p.</b> <b>o.).</b> Side effects were significantly less often reported under <b>p.</b> <b>o.</b> treatment (19 % <b>p.</b> <b>o.</b> vs. 53 % i. v.) Conclusion <b>P.</b> <b>o.</b> chemotherapy shows a high acceptance in MBC patients under palliative therapy.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{proposed}} that ovale malaria in humans is caused by two closely related but distinct species of malaria parasite, Plasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri. It was recently shown that these two parasite types are sympatric at the country level. However, it remains possible that localised geographic, temporal or ecological barriers exist within endemic countries which prevent recombination between the genomes of the two species. Here, using conventional and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods specifically designed to discriminate <b>P.</b> <b>o.</b> curtisi and <b>P.</b> <b>o.</b> wallikeri, it is shown that both species are present among clinic attendees in Congo-Brazzaville, and occur simultaneously both in lake-side and inland districts in Uganda and on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. Thus <b>P.</b> <b>o.</b> curtisi and <b>P.</b> <b>o.</b> wallikeri in these localities are exactly sympatric in both time and space. These {{findings are consistent with}} the existence of a biological barrier, rather than geographical or ecological factors, preventing recombination between <b>P.</b> <b>o.</b> curtisi and <b>P.</b> <b>o.</b> wallikeri. In cross-sectional surveys carried out in Uganda and Bioko, our results show that infections with P. ovale spp. are more common than previously thought, occurring at a frequency of 1 – 6 % in population samples, with both proposed species contributing to ovale malaria in six sites.

Aim of the studyTo investigate the antinociceptive effect of ethanol extract from Lecythis pisonis leaves (LPEE), fractions (hexane-LPHF, ether-LPEF and ethyl acetate-LPEAF) and mixture of triterpenes [ursolic and oleanolic acids (MT) ] in mice. Materials and methodsLPEE and LPEF were evaluated on the acetic acid induced writhings and formalin, capsaicin and glutamate tests. In addition, MT was investigated on the writhings induced by acetic acid, capsaicin and glutamate tests. In the study of some possible mechanisms involved on the antinociceptive effect of LPEF, it was investigated the participation of opioid system, K+ATP channels and l-arginine-nitric oxide pathway. ResultsLPEE (12. 5 and 25 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.),</b> LPEF and MT (6. 25, 12. 5 and 25 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> reduced the writhings in comparison to saline. LPEE (100 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> and LPEF (50 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> were effective in inhibiting both phases of formalin test. In capsaicin test, LPEE (100 and 200 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.),</b> LPEF (12. 5 – 50 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o)</b> and MT (6. 25 – 25 mg/kg, <b>p.</b> <b>o.)</b> showed a significant antinociceptive effect compared to the control.

Four different sensitivity regimes are obtained based on the indicator. The sensitivity is found to show a distinctive pattern in each regime. In Regime I (Φ <b>P</b> (<b>O</b> 3) almost linearly increases with increasing HC and almost linearly decreases with increasing NO x. In Regime II (1 <b>P</b> (<b>O</b> 3) with HC and a less-than-linear decrease with NO x. <b>P</b> (<b>O</b> 3) less-than-linearly increases with both HC and NO x in Regime III (9 ± 5 45 ± 7). During the campaign, 91 percent of <b>P</b> (<b>O</b> 3) data appear in Regime III and IV, indicating that NO x is a limiting factor of ozone production. Hence, it may be an efficient strategy to control NO x emission for ozone abatement at the site. Comparisons between the observed <b>P</b> (<b>O</b> 3) and the ones modelled have represented general agreement. However, the model tends to underestimate <b>P</b> (<b>O</b> 3) in Regime II, implying that an important source of peroxy radicals is possibly missed. In Regime IV, the modelled <b>P</b> (<b>O</b> 3) is systematically larger than the measured one under a low j (O 1 D) condition, which may be caused by the over-estimated yields of peroxy radicals from the reactions of monoterpenes with ozone. A budget analysis indicates that sensitivity of <b>P</b> (<b>O</b> 3) is declining with HC and enhancing with NO when the condition shifts from Regime II to Regime IV, which is also observed through the analysis of <b>P</b> (<b>O</b> 3) sensitivity using Φ. Sensitivity studies for <b>P</b> (<b>O</b> 3) are conducted to determine the effect of NO x and monoterpenes on ozone production and the conclusions are very consistent with those derived from the indicator.

40|$|Moringa oleifera (Moringaecea) {{are used}} in Indian {{traditional}} medicine and in folklore for many diseases and extensively used as CNS depressant traditionally. The interesting things of this plant are each part of Moringa oleifera is used as medicines. The present work {{has been carried out}} to evaluate the anti-epileptic activity of fresh fruit juice of Moringa oleifera against maximal electroshock (M. E. S) and Picrotoxin (PTX) induced convulsions in mice at different dose level (100 ml/kg. <b>p.</b> <b>o</b> & 50 ml/kg. <b>p.</b> <b>o).</b> Diazepam (5 mg/kg. <b>p.</b> <b>o)</b> and Phenytoin (25 mg/kg. i. p) were used as reference standard drugs. The data obtained indicates that the fresh fruit juice of Moringa oleifera at the dose of (50 ml/kg <b>p.</b> <b>o</b> & 100 ml/kg <b>p.</b> <b>o)</b> shows anticonvulsant activity against Maximal electroshock and Picrotoxin induced convulsion in mice. </p...|$|R

40|$|Detection and {{mapping of}} Posidonia Oceanica (<b>P.</b> <b>O.)</b> meadows in the Mediterranean sea {{is crucial to}} {{preserve}} the endemic ecosystems and to underscore {{the negative impact of}} many anthropogenic activities. Furthermore, navigating Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) in marine environments where the ground is densely colonized with <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> is nowadays a challenging task, since this sea-grass generates dynamic and extremely textured areas, difficult to match in consecutive or loop-closing images. This paper presents two important contributions: a) a complete assessment to characterize areas of <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> with visual features, in order to obtain visual localization data as accurate as possible; b) the automatic detection of <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> in video sequences grabbed from the AUV Sparus II in coastal areas; the images containing the detected sea-grass will be used later to build visual mosaics showing the real extension and form of the <b>P.</b> <b>O.</b> meadow.

40|$|Various {{combinations}} of immunization routes were examined for ability to elicit or prolong (or both) a salivary secretory immunoglobulin A response to Streptococcus mutans strain Ingbritt (serotype c) in Macaca fascicularis monkeys. Intraductal (i. d.), per <b>os</b> (<b>p.</b> <b>o.),</b> and subcutaneous (s. c.) routes were utilized. Four {{groups of three}} to five monkeys each were immunized by the following schedules: group I [...] <b>p.</b> <b>o.,</b> s. c., i. d.; group II [...] i. d., <b>p.</b> <b>o.,</b> i. d.; group III [...] s. c., <b>p.</b> <b>o.,</b> i. d.; and group IV [...] control. Immune responses in the serum and parotid fluid were quantitated by using passive hemagglutination assays with purified serotype-specific polysaccharide and by indirect immunofluorescent staining assays. Both s. c. and i. d., but not <b>p.</b> <b>o.,</b> routes resulted in detectable serum antibody responses. Only i. d. immunization resulted in a measurable salivary response. Indirect immunofluorescent staining revealed specific secretory immunoglobulin A antibodies in the parotid fluid which correlated with passive hemagglutination titers.
