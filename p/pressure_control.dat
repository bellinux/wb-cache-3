Within these settings, CPAs have resulted in improved attainment of goal laboratory values like hemoglobin A1c for diabetics, improved lung function for asthmatics, and improved blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> for people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant <b>pressure</b> <b>control.</b> Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> {{ventilation}} is {{a common}} mode of ventilation used to manage both adult and pediatric populations. However, {{there is very little}} evidence that distinguishes the efficacy of <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation over that of volume controlled ventilation in the adult population. This gap in the literature {{may be due to the}} absence of a consistent and systematic algorithm for managing <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation. This article provides a brief overview of the applications of both <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation and volume controlled ventilation and proposes an algorithmic approach to the management of patients receiving <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation. This algorithmic approach highlights the need for clinicians to have a comprehensive conceptual understanding of mechanical ventilation, pulmonary physiology, and interpretation of ventilator graphics in order to best care for patients receiving <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation. The objective of identifying a systematic approach to managing <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation is to provide a more generalizable and equitable approach to management of the ICU patient. Ideally, a consistent approach to managing <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation in the adult population will glean more reliable information regarding actual patient outcomes, as well as the efficacy of <b>pressure</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation when compared to volume controlled ventilation...|$|R

25|$|Within each {{ventilatory}} pattern {{there are}} several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a “zone of comfort” (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all {{the parameters of the}} pressure waveform (<b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> during a single inspiration.Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as fuzzy logic, rule based expert systems, and artificial neural networks.|$|E
25|$|A {{high-speed}} door is a {{very fast}} door some with opening speeds of up to 4m/s, mainly used in the industrial sector where {{the speed of a}} door has an effect on production logistics, temperature and <b>pressure</b> <b>control.</b> high-speed clean room doors are used in pharmaceutical industries for the special curtain and stainless steel frames. They guarantee the tightness of all accesses. The powerful high-speed doors have a smooth surface structure and no protruding edges. Therefore, they can be easily cleaned and depositing of particles is largely excluded. High-speed doors are made to handle a high number of openings, generally more than 200000 a year. They need to be built with heavy duty parts and counterbalance systems for speed enhancement and emergency opening function. The door curtain was originally made of PVC, but was later also developed in aluminium and acrylic glass sections. High Speed refrigeration and cold room doors with excellent insulation values was also introduced with the Green and Energy saving requirements.|$|E
25|$|A {{primitive}} tourniquet can be {{made from}} a stick and a rope (or leather belt). The rope is made into a loop that fits over the damaged limb and the stick is inserted through the loop. The loop is tightened by twisting the stick. The primitive device may stem the flow of blood but side-effects such as soft tissue damage and nerve damage may occur due to the application of unknown, uncontrollable and excessively high pressures and pressure gradients. It is well established by evidence in the clinical literature that higher tourniquet pressures are associated with higher probabilities of tourniquet-related injuries. Modern pneumatic tourniquet systems are microcomputer-based, allowing more accurate and automatic <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> and many important safety features to minimize the risk of patient injury. Recent trends toward personalized care has increased patient safety by allowing perioperative staff to measure and select a personalized tourniquet pressure based on the patient’s Limb Occlusion Pressure, and select and apply a personalized tourniquet cuff that can adapt the shape of the tourniquet cuff {{to a wide range of}} non-cylindrical limb shapes.|$|E
