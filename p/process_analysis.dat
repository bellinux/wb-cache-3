5|$|The longest-lived {{and most}} {{abundant}} (nearly 100%) naturally occurring isotope of protactinium, protactinium-231, has a half-life of 32,760 {{years and is}} a decay product of uranium-235. Much smaller trace amounts of the short-lived nuclear isomer protactinium-234m occur in the decay chain of uranium-238. Protactinium-233 results from the decay of thorium-233 {{as part of the}} chain of events used to produce uranium-233 by neutron irradiation of thorium-232. It is an undesired intermediate product in thorium-based nuclear reactors and is therefore removed from the active zone of the reactor during the breeding <b>process.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the relative concentrations of various uranium, thorium and protactinium isotopes in water and minerals is used in radiometric dating of sediments which are up to 175,000 years old and in modeling of various geological processes.|$|E

[...] When planning the integration of fragmentation measurement instrumentation, position your camera monitoring station in a location where you can effect a process control change based upon the particle size information you receive. [...] For example, the primary crusher product is a good location to measure, since {{you are able to}} control the size that the crusher is producing with slight adjustments to the crusher ensuring that the downstream comminution circuit is receiving a consistent product to help reduce variability in the process. [...] In addition to the continuous particle size analysis, the database of belt material size can be used for simulations and for further <b>process</b> <b>analysis</b> to help increase process efficiency and throughput.|$|E

[...] "Certainly the interest in being released from incarceration is of sufficient magnitude to have some bearing on the process due." [...] Moreover, the Court did not even focus on the risk of error that the Nebraska procedure actually entailed, with the result that its analysis of the effect on that risk additional procedures would have was necessarily skewed as well. [...] Finally, due process also required that the procedures appear fair as well as actually be fair. [...] The Court had ignored this aspect of the due <b>process</b> <b>analysis</b> as well.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{some aspects of}} <b>process</b> {{capability}} <b>analysis</b> are considered. <b>Process</b> capability <b>analysis</b> deals with how to assess the capability of manufacturing processes. Based on the <b>process</b> capability <b>analysis</b> one can determine how the process performs relative to its product requirements or specifications. An important part within <b>process</b> capability <b>analysis</b> {{is the use of}} process capability indices. This thesis focuses on process capability indices in the situation when the specification limits are one-sided. The thesis consists of a summary and three papers, of which one is already published in an international journal. The summary gives a background to the research area, a short overview of the three papers, and some suggestions for future research. In Paper I, the frequency and use of <b>process</b> capability <b>analysis</b> together with statistical process control and design of experiments, within Swedish companies hiring alumni students are investigated. We also investigate what motivates organisations to implement or not implement these statistical methods, if there are differences in use that can be related to organisational types and what will be needed to increase the use.

2500|$|Following the {{publication}} of the original version of CSP, Hoare, Stephen Brookes, and A. W. Roscoe developed and refined the theory of CSP into its modern, process algebraic form. The approach taken in developing CSP into a process algebra was influenced by Robin Milner's work on the Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS), and vice versa. The theoretical version of CSP was initially presented in a 1984 article by Brookes, Hoare, and Roscoe, and later in Hoare's book Communicating Sequential Processes, which was published in 1985. In September 2006, that book was still the [...] computer science reference of all time according to Citeseer (albeit an unreliable source {{due to the nature of}} its sampling). The theory of CSP has undergone a few minor changes since {{the publication}} of Hoare's book. Most of these changes were motivated by the advent of automated tools for CSP <b>process</b> <b>analysis</b> and verification. Roscoe's The Theory and Practice of Concurrency describes this newer version of CSP.|$|E

The <b>process</b> performance <b>analysis</b> supports goals monitoring, allowing {{to detect and}} to treat threats to goals achievement. In this context, measurement is essential. The collected data for measures are {{used to analyze the}} process performance and to guide informed decisions that lead to the achievement of business and technical goals. For software organizations, the <b>process</b> performance <b>analysis</b> is a high maturity practice. In this context, although there are several standards that address the importance of software measurement and its use in <b>process</b> performance <b>analysis,</b> the vocabulary used by these standards concerning software measurement is diverse.
