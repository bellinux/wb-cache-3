5|$|Sexuality is an {{important}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> person's identity, although some people might {{have no interest in}} sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a woman, or as an attractive person).|$|E
5|$|Lord Anglesey {{became the}} captain of Cowes Castle in 1826, by now a sinecure rather than a regular {{military}} appointment, and spent <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> year at the castle, making further, lavish improvements to the interiors. Anglesey was {{also a member of}} the Royal Yacht Squadron, first established in 1815, which then operated from the Gloster Hotel in Cowes. By this time yachting had become a prestigious local event; the painter J. M. W. Turner sketched the yachts sailing off the castle when he visited in 1827. When Anglesey died in 1854 the government decommissioned the castle and leased the property initially to Anglesey's son-in-law Lord Conyngham, and then to the Squadron in 1855.|$|E

5|$|Natural ice {{was put to}} many uses. The ice trade enabled its {{widespread}} use in medicine in attempts to treat diseases and to alleviate their symptoms, as well as making tropical hospitals more bearable. In Calcutta, for example, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> ice shipment was specially reserved in the city's ice house {{for the use of}} the local doctors. By the middle of the 19th century, the British Royal Navy was using imported ice to cool the interiors of its ships' gun turrets. In 1864, and after several attempts, salmon eggs were finally shipped successfully from Britain to Australia, using natural ice to keep them chilled on route, enabling the creation of the Tasmanian salmon fishery industry.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed the feeling of being in a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two diametrically opposed characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, and as long as they made it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales are}} highly curved, which creates inter-scale reflection. This {{mechanism}} is unusual among Lepidoptera. The proximal <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> scale is almost flat; the scale then gradually curves {{up and then}} steeply bends down at the distal end, covering the proximal part of the next row of scales. Because of this shape, adjacent rows of scales have valley-like grooves between them. This allows light to strike one scale, reflect at a roughly 90° angle, strike the next scale, and be reflected away from the wing. Because the angle of each reflection is far from normal incidence, the interference effect favours reflection of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes {{near the top of}} the curved part of the scale.|$|E

5|$|The use of Egypt's immense land rents {{to finance}} the Empire's {{operations}} resulted from Augustus' conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government. As it was effectively considered Augustus' private property rather than a province of the Empire, it became <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> succeeding emperor's patrimonium. Instead of a legate or proconsul, Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports; this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming Prefect of the Praetorian Guard. The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions, as well as bread and circuses for the population of Rome.|$|E
5|$|This {{constellation}} forms {{part of the}} zodiac, {{and hence}} is intersected by the ecliptic. This circle across the celestial sphere forms the apparent path of the Sun as the Earth completes its annual orbit. As the orbital plane of the Moon and the planets lie near the ecliptic, they can usually {{be found in the}} constellation Taurus during some <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> year. The galactic plane of the Milky Way intersects the northeast corner of the constellation and the galactic anticenter is located near the border between Taurus and Auriga. Taurus is the only constellation crossed by all three of the galactic equator, celestial equator, and ecliptic. A ring-like galactic structure known as Gould's Belt passes through the constellation.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most WWE events, where {{rules and}} {{participants}} for matches {{were determined by}} WWE's creative staff, {{this was the first}} event where at least some <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> match was determined by votes from WWE fans conducted on WWE's official website. The event was scheduled to feature eight professional wrestling matches. Various wrestlers were involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines leading to the matches taking place at this event. Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or fan favorites as they followed a series of tension-building events. The event featured wrestlers and other talent from the Raw brand– a storyline division in which WWE assigned its on-air talent to separate television brands.|$|E

5|$|In {{the public}} school system of Baltimore city, music {{education}} is a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> grade level to high school, at which point it becomes optional. Beginning in first grade, or approximately six years old, Baltimore students begin to learn about melody, harmony and rhythm, and are taught to echo short melodic and rhythmic patterns. They also begin to learn about different musical instruments and distinguish between different kinds of sounds and types of songs. As students progress through the grades, teachers go into more detail and require more proficiency in elementary musical techniques. Students perform rounds in second grade, for example, while movement (i.e. dance) enters the curriculum in third grade. Beginning in middle school in the sixth grade, students are taught to make mature aesthetic judgements, and to understand and respond to a variety of forms of music. In high school, students may choose to take courses in instrumentation or singing, and may be exposed to music {{in other areas of the}} curriculum, such as in theater or drama classes.|$|E
