5|$|Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston, {{were both}} wealthy, and had aggressively {{purchased}} and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 {{to build a}} winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as Prohibition was implemented, and if their team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right <b>price,</b> <b>the</b> Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase.|$|E

5|$|By 1980, Gulf {{exhibited}} many of {{the characteristics}} of a giant corporation that had lost its way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share <b>price.</b> <b>The</b> stock market value of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation, and rival Houston competitor Dynegy offered to purchase the company at a very low <b>price.</b> <b>The</b> deal failed, and on December 2, 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.

During the development phase, the designers planned on using French Exocet anti-ship missiles as the class's main weapon system. However, due to the high <b>price</b> <b>the</b> French asked for the missile, possibly because of political reasons, the project was changed and two Soviet P-20 (SS-N-2B) were used instead. Self-defense measures include two Wallop Barricade chaff launchers.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial <b>price.</b> <b>The</b> principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E

5|$|In September 1998 Manchester United {{were the}} target of a {{proposed}} takeover by British Sky Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Negotiations between both sides had begun during the summer, but had stalled after disagreements over the asking <b>price.</b> <b>The</b> satellite group’s original bid of £575million – initially thought to be their final offer – was deemed too low by two members of United’s board (chairman Martin Edwards and Professor Sir Roland Smith), who pressed for a higher figure. Two days of talks followed and in an attempt to close the deal, BSkyB made a final bid of £623.4million.|$|E
5|$|It {{was decided}} {{early on that}} most of the budget be spent on the writing and voice actors. The {{original}} story was written in French by Jean-Luc Cano, and converted into a game script by the co-directors and design team. It was subsequently handed over to Christian Divine and Cano to be fine tuned in English. Story and character development were highlighted over point-and-click puzzles, making choice and consequence integral to how the narrative unfolds. Hannah Telle auditioned for Max Caulfield in July 2014 and was offered the part; Ashly Burch auditioned for both Max and her given role Chloe <b>Price.</b> <b>The</b> recording sessions were done in Los Angeles, California, with the French developer brought in via Skype.|$|E

50|$|From the marketer's {{point of}} view, an {{efficient}} price {{is a price}} that {{is very close to}} the maximum that customers are prepared to pay. In economic terms, it is a price that shifts most of the consumer economic surplus to the producer. A good pricing strategy would be the one which could balance between <b>the</b> <b>price</b> floor (<b>the</b> <b>price</b> below which <b>the</b> organization ends up in losses) and <b>the</b> <b>price</b> ceiling (<b>the</b> <b>price</b> by which <b>the</b> organization experiences a no-demand situation).|$|R

5|$|On 17 May 2008, the BBC {{reported}} that the tenants had put the remaining 40 years of their lease up for sale, with an asking price of £15,000,000. Within four days, there were over 50 potential buyers, which led to fears from residents that the island's identity would be lost if it was bought by the wrong owner. In September 2008 {{it was announced that}} Starboard Settlement, a trust, had acquired the remainder of the lease for considerably less than the asking <b>price.</b> <b>The</b> trust formed a company based in Guernsey, Herm Island Ltd, to manage the island for the trustees.|$|E
5|$|Political and {{financial}} problems led to very low {{oil prices and}} oversupply, causing most metals to drop in <b>price.</b> <b>The</b> economies of China, India and other emerging countries slowed in 2014 and 2015. In 2014 alone, 23,722,890 motor vehicles were produced in China, excluding motorbikes. This resulted in a rhodium price of 740.00 US-$ per Troy ounce (31.1 grams) in late November 2015.|$|E
