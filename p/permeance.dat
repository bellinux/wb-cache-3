30|$|In[6], how to {{implement}} the TCM for flux-switching machine is explained. To calculate the airgap and magnet-related <b>permeances,</b> electrostatic FEM (eFEM) is used. Although the accuracy of FEM is very good, it requires {{a long time for}} an adequate mesh and for the solving process. Additionally, the results need to be post-processed in MATLAB before the <b>permeances</b> are inserted in the TCM network. To overcome these problems and for a full integration into the MATLAB environment, SC mapping is used instead of FEM to calculate the airgap <b>permeances.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{efficient}} and effective magnetic circuit model is developed {{for the analysis of}} a magnetless double-rotor flux switching motor. First, a magnetic circuit network for the proposed machine is built, and formulas for the calculation of the magnetic components in the circuit, including the <b>permeances</b> of teeth, yokes, slots, leakage <b>permeances,</b> and air-gap <b>permeances,</b> are derived. Then, by applying Kirchhoff's current law to each node in the network, nodal analysis is used to solve the matrix equation. All the circuit variables, and hence the complete motor magnetic characteristics are being considered. When the rotor rotates, the air-gap <b>permeances</b> are adjusted accordingly, and the above calculations are repeated, so as to find the complete static performance of the motor. Last, the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed method are verified using both the experimental results and the simulation results obtained from the time-stepping finite-element method.

40|$|Using the Maxwell-Stefan (M-S) {{diffusion}} equations as a basis, we derive simple analytic {{expression for}} {{the estimation of}} component <b>permeances</b> of mixtures across micro- and mesoporous membranes {{on the basis of}} unary permeation data. The analytic procedure uses two simplifying assumptions: (1) downstream pressures are negligibly small in comparison to upstream pressures, and (2) adsorption equilibrium within the pores can be described by Henry law coefficients. Two limiting scenarios are considered in estimating the M-S exchange coefficients, Ðij: (1) correlations negligible, and (2) correlations dominant. In the correlations negligible scenario, the <b>permeances</b> of each component in the mixture equal that of the corresponding pure components. For the correlations dominant scenario, the <b>permeances</b> in the mixture are significantly different from the pure component values; the differences being dictated not only by mobilities of the species within the pores, but also by the adsorption equilibrium.

40|$|The permeabilities of {{amino acids}} for {{isolated}} cuticular membranes of ivy (Hedera helix L.) were measured at different pH. Cuticular <b>permeances</b> were lowest for the zwitterionic form at pH 6, {{followed by the}} cationic form at pH 1. Highest <b>permeances</b> were obtained for the anionic form at pH 11. <b>Permeances</b> {{were not correlated with}} octanol/water partition coefficients and decreased at a given pH with increasing molar volume of the solute. This finding suggests that permeation takes place in the polar cuticular pathways. The effect of pH on the cuticular transport properties was analysed according to the porous membrane model considering the polyelectrolytic character of the cuticle in terms of porosity, tortuosity, and size selectivity of the aqueous cuticular pathway which is altered by pH. An increase of water content and permeability of the cuticular membrane was caused by the dissociation of weak acidic groups with increasing pH leading to a swelling of the cuticle induced by fixed negative charges. In addition, the pH-dependent size of the hydration shell of the amino acids was identified as a secondary factor explaining the variability of cuticular <b>permeances...</b>|$|R

40|$|Transport {{characteristics}} of several gases (O 2, O 3, CO 2, H 2 S, SO 2, CH 3 SH, NO 2 and H 2 O) for cuticles isolated from leaves and fruits {{of a variety}} of plant species were investigated. It was shown that: (1) Cuticular <b>permeances</b> determined at high partial pressure depend strongly on the condensability of the respective gas. They rise exponentially with increasing boiling point of the gases; (2) The partition coefficient for SO 2 between the dry cuticle and the surrounding gas phase rises when the partial pressure is decreased. This behavior is explained tentatively as a combination of gas adsorption at internal surfaces of the cuticle and dissolution of the gas in the cuticular polymer network. This conception implies significant interactions between different gases present in the air (e. g. SO 2 and water vapor). The use of a model allows the mathematical extrapolation to gas concentrations which occur in the environment, and for which the partition coefficients or <b>permeances</b> cannot be determined directly. The mathematical treatment corresponds to the 'dual-mode sorption' model for polymers which are in the glassy state. A great number of deposition experiments with typical pollutant gas concentrations have shown clearly that the deposition velocities to plant surfaces after stomatal closure had been accomplished were much higher than the corresponding cuticular <b>permeances</b> observed so far. Although the dual-mode sorption model predicts higher cuticular <b>permeances</b> at ambient pollutant concentrations, other hypothetical reasons for the discrepancy between observed surface flux velocities and cuticular <b>permeances</b> have to be taken into account.

40|$|Weight {{limitations}} in electric/hybrid cars demand {{the highest possible}} power-to-weight ratio from the traction motor, as in double salient permanent magnet (PM) machines. Their high flux densities in the air gap result in nonlinear analytical models, which need to be time optimized. The incorporated reluctance networks {{are sensitive to the}} correctness of air gap <b>permeances.</b> Conventionally, in these networks, air gap <b>permeances</b> are calculated by approximating flux paths; however, it is time inefficient. For an improved simulation time, spatial discretization techniques are presented to calculate air gap <b>permeances</b> in double salient PM machines. The spatial techniques discussed here cover the tooth contour method and Schwarz–Christoffel (SC) mapping as semidiscrete methods, which are used to discretize only the air gap region. Their results are verified by the spatial discrete method and finite element method, which discretizes the whole machine geometry. For consistency in this paper, all methods are explained on a three-phase 12 / 10 flux-switching PM motor. Obtained air gap <b>permeances</b> show a very good agreement with only 0. 8 % difference. Further on, machine characteristics such as phase flux linkage and cogging torque are also compared to show the impact of the modeling techniques. The total machine simulation time is improved by 20 % using the SC method. Although methods are explained particularly for double salient PM machines, formulas are generalizable for other machine types as well...|$|R

Gas adsorption analysis indicates that the Pd-doped organosilica membrane has larger micropores compared with the undoped organosilica membrane.

The selectivities (H 2 relative to other gases) were lower than Knudsen for dense CNT membranes, as shown in Fig.  3 c. These results clearly indicate that the high <b>permeances</b> through these dense CNT membranes are not Knudsen [17]. Surface diffusion and viscous flow may play important roles in the transport of gas molecules through the aligned CNT membranes. From the perspective of separations, lower flux with higher separation for surface diffusion and higher flux with lower separation is obtained for viscous flow. The low gas selectivities indicate the presence of viscous flow in the membrane. Although the average pore diameter is less than 10 nm, the CNT membranes may have a few large pores that favor high molecule weight gases permeation. Furthermore, the smooth surface of the CNTs may {{also play a role}} in the selectivity derivation of gas molecules from the Knudsen diffusion.|$|R

The effect of temperature (from 300 C to 600 C) and of relative pressure (from 0. 2 MPa to 0. 5 MPa) was studied. In general, rises of both these parameters allowed increasing H 2 permeate flux. The Pd–Ag membrane showed {{to have a great}} selectivity, as when inlet gas mixture contained different compositions of CO 2, CO or CH 4, these gases were never detected in membrane permeate side. However, when hydrogen content in inlet gas decreased, a significant reduction in H 2 permeate flux was observed, especially when CO was present, probably due to the deposition of solid carbon in membrane surface by Boudouard reaction.
