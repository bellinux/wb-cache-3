Soon the train comes to the next major scenic highlight of the trip: Yellowhead Lake.Yellowhead Mountain continues to hover overhead to the north (left side of the train going east) while Mounts Rockingham (7,797 feet) and Fitzwilliam (9,549 feet) {{can be seen to}} the south(to the right) across the lake. The train finally crosses the Continental Divide at Yellowhead Pass, which at 3,718 feet is the lowest crossing of the divide in North America.

500|$|In the ride's climax, Doctor Octopus {{lifts the}} Scoop up to {{a height of}} [...] using the anti-gravity cannon. A number of {{synchronized}} effects help achieve this without the vehicle leaving the ground. These include a movable building set, lighting cues, simulator movements, projections and wind effects. Spider-Man attempts to pull the Scoop down, but is attacked by all the supervillains. Spider-Man thwarts them, but not before Doctor Octopus disengages the anti-gravity device, sending the Scoop on a simulated freefall until it is rescued by Spider-Man's webbing right above the ground and another Stan Lee cameo. Spider-Man manages to capture all of the supervillains by tying them with webs. As the vehicle <b>pulls</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> unload station, Spider-Man thanks the guests for their help and sends {{them back to the}} Daily Bugle, where he has rigged the anti-gravity cannon to lift Jameson up to the ceiling in his office. Guests unload while a modern rendition of the classic Spider-Man theme song plays and a voiceover by Stan Lee instructs the riders on exiting properly.|$|E
