30|$|The {{stability}} of <b>PSOA</b> in aqueous environments under environmentally relevant pH values has been assessed following OECD Test Guideline 111 [2].

Based on these results, <b>PSOA</b> is considered hydrolytically unstable at environmentally relevant pH values. Experience with <b>PSOA</b> indicates that its stability in water is influenced by its aqueous concentration, with low ppm levels of <b>PSOA</b> showing less stability than higher concentrations (data not shown). This is important considering that in commercial applications of <b>PSOA,</b> the chemical is diluted prior to application and wastewater effluent containing <b>PSOA</b> {{is likely to be}} mixed with other facility wastewater lacking <b>PSOA,</b> further diluting the overall <b>PSOA</b> concentration prior to discharge and potentially accelerating chemical hydrolysis. Therefore, <b>PSOA</b> is not expected to persist in the environment.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>PSOA</b> RuleML is an object-relational rule {{language}} general-izing POSL, OO RuleML, F-logic, and RIF-BLD. In <b>PSOA</b> RuleML, {{the notion}} of positional-slotted, object-applicative (<b>psoa)</b> terms {{is used as a}} generalization of: (1) positional-slotted terms in POSL and OO RuleML and (2) frame and class-membership terms in F-logic and RIF-BLD. We demonstrate an online <b>PSOA</b> RuleML reasoning service, PSOATransRun, consisting of a translator and an execution engine. The translator, <b>PSOA</b> 2 TPTP, maps knowledge bases and queries in the <b>PSOA</b> RuleML presentation syntax to the popular TPTP interchange language, which is supported by many first-order logic theorem provers. The trans-lated documents are then executed by the open-source VampirePrime reasoner to perform query answering. In our implementation, we use the ANTLR v 3 parser generator tool to build the translator based on the grammars we developed. We wrap the translator and execution engine as resources into a RESTful Web API for convenient access. The presen-tation demonstrates PSOATransRun with a suite of examples that also constitute an online-interactive introduction to <b>PSOA</b> RuleML. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{particle}} swarm {{optimization algorithm}} in size and shape optimization P. C. Fourie and A. A. Groenwold Abstract Shape and size optimization problems instruc-tural design are addressed using the particle swarm op-timization algorithm (<b>PSOA).</b> In our implementation of the <b>PSOA,</b> the social behaviour of birds is mimicked. In-dividual birds exchange information about their position, velocity and fitness, and the behaviour of the flock is then influenced to increase the probability of migration to re-gions of high fitness. New operators in the <b>PSOA,</b> namely the elite velocity and the elite particle, are introduced. Standard size and shape design problems selected from literature are {{used to evaluate the}} performance of the <b>PSOA.</b> The performance of the <b>PSOA</b> is compared with that of three gradient based methods, as well as the genetic algorithm (GA).

30|$|As noted earlier, the {{disposal}} of <b>PSOA</b> via industry wastewater effluent requires identification of aquatic hazards of this chemical.

25|$|The lumbar plexus {{is formed}} lateral to the {{intervertebral}} foramina by the ventral rami {{of the first}} four lumbar spinal nerves (L1-L4), which all pass through <b>psoas</b> major. The larger branches of the plexus exit the muscle to pass sharply downward to reach the abdominal wall and the thigh (under the inguinal ligament); {{with the exception of}} the obturator nerve which pass through the lesser pelvis to reach the medial part of the thigh through the obturator foramen. The nerves of the lumbar plexus pass in front of the hip joint and mainly support the anterior part of the thigh.|$|E
25|$|The {{obturator}} nerve (L2-L4) passes medially behind <b>psoas</b> major {{to exit the}} pelvis through the obturator canal, after which it gives off branches to obturator externus and divides into two branches passing behind {{and in front of}} adductor brevis to supply motor innervation to all the other adductor muscles. The anterior branch also supplies sensory nerves to the skin on a small area on the distal medial aspect of the thigh. The femoral nerve (L2-L4) is the largest and longest of the nerves of the lumbar plexus. It supplies motor innervation to iliopsoas, pectineus, sartorius, and quadriceps; and sensory branches to the anterior thigh, medial lower leg, and posterior foot.|$|E
25|$|The iliohypogastric (T12-L1) and ilioinguinal nerves (L1) {{emerge from}} the <b>psoas</b> major near the muscle's origin, from where they run {{laterally}} downward to pass anteriorly above the iliac crest between the transversus abdominis and abdominal internal oblique, and then run above the inguinal ligament.

Iliohypogastric supplies sensory branches to {{the skin of the}} lateral hip region, and its terminal branch finally pierces the aponeurosis of the abdominal external oblique above the inguinal ring to supply sensory branches to the skin there. Ilioinguinalis exits through the inguinal ring and supplies sensory branches to the skin above the pubic symphysis and the lateral portion of the scrotum.|$|E

30|$|To {{gauge the}} {{hydrophilic}} nature of <b>PSOA,</b> EPI Suite software [KOWWIN Program (v 1.68)] {{was used to}} estimate the Log Kow values {{for two of the}} primary components of <b>PSOA,</b> 10 -hydroxy- 9 -sulfooctadecaneperoxoic acid and 10 -hydroxy- 9 -sulfooctadecanoic acid [16]. Based on this work, a representative Log Kow of 3.12 was identified. The adsorption coefficient (Log Koc) can be used to estimate <b>PSOA’s</b> ability to bind to suspended sediment in water. Testing conducted in accordance with OECD Test Guidelines 121 identified Koc values ranging from 0 to 190, 546 (Log Koc of un-retained to 5.28) [1]. To identify a representative value in this range, a Koc weighted average based on the percent peak area of the test solutions was calculated to be 1.06, resulting in a Log Koc estimate of 0.024. This representative value indicates a relatively low sediment binding potential overall for the <b>PSOA</b> mixture; however, select minor fractions of the <b>PSOA</b> mixture may readily bind sediment.|$|R

40|$|In Positional-Slotted Object-Applicative (<b>PSOA)</b> RuleML, a {{predicate}} application (atom) {{can have}} an Object IDentifier (OID) and descriptors that may be positional arguments (tuples) or attribute-value pairs (slots). <b>PSOA</b> RuleML 1. 0 specifies for each descriptor whether {{it is to be}} interpreted under the perspective of the predicate in whose scope it occurs. This perspectivity dimension refines the space between oidless, positional atoms (relationships) and oidful, slotted atoms (frames) : While relationships use only a predicate-scope-sensitive (predicate-dependent) tuple and frames use only predicate-scope-insensitive (predicate-independent) slots, <b>PSOA</b> RuleML 1. 0 uses a systematics of orthogonal constructs also permitting atoms with (predicate-) independent tuples and atoms with (predicate-) dependent slots. This supports data and knowledge representation where a slot attribute can have different values depending on the predicate. <b>PSOA</b> thus extends object-oriented multi-membership and multiple inheritance. Based on objectification, <b>PSOA</b> laws are given: Besides unscoping and centralization, the semantic restriction and transformation of describution permits rescoping of one atom's independent descriptors to another atom with the same OID but a different predicate. For inheritance, default descriptors are realized by rules. On top of a metamodel and a Grailog visualization, <b>PSOA's</b> atom systematics for facts, queries, and rules is explained. The presentation and (XML-) serialization syntaxes of <b>PSOA</b> RuleML 1. 0 are introduced. Its model-theoretic semantics is formalized by extending the earlier interpretation functions for dependent descriptors.
