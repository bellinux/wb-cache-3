40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review and {{critique}} the field of public sector accounting research. Many nation states deliver essential public services. In recent times, many of these nations have been involved in programmes of “modernisation”, which, in part, means that these public services now are significantly managed, delivered and governed by private and third sector organisations. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employs a literature-based analysis and critique of public sector accounting articles published in the selected journals from 1992 to 2006. From this, a descriptive meta-analysis of the characteristics of the research will be discussed. Finally, a conceptual analysis of the selected literature will be used to evaluate the field and address a possible future research agenda. Findings – The descriptive analysis highlights that among the research papers reviewed several interesting patterns emerged concerning public service research. Also, the dominance of Australasia and UK research was noted. The extent of research in different levels of government/jurisdiction indicated that the majority of research was organisationally based. Finally, when the various functional types of accounting are considered, management accounting remained the most researched area of interest. Research limitations/implications – The paper only considered research within eight selected journals and over the period 1992 to 2006. Therefore, for instance, US mainstream public sector accounting research has not been reviewed. Originality/value – The main implications of the paper are that “contextual” <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>accounting</b> research has a strong tradition and, through the process of reflection and critique of the body of work, several important insights are provided in order to highlight areas for further research and policy development. 41 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - How could memory, {{heritage}} and post-disaster construction integrated in practice? The {{purpose of this}} paper is to introduce our approach in public participation of reconstruction plan, after a raging fire destroyed part of the historic town of Shangri-la, China. Approach – We develop two kind of crowd sourcing platform to collect and also present memory of the vanishing streets which were distroyed completely by fire. One is on Wechat platform. Through secondary development on Wechat Platform, we built a <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>account</b> that allowed users to upload photos, hand-painted pictures, and text, all of the files can be saved automaticly in our database. The other platform in on web. The website is designed for users to upload photos based on location where they were taken. All the images collected from the two platforms can be open accessed viewed with location information, which had been sort out by volunteers. The wechat platform is also used to communicate and provide education and information of the historic town to promote awareness of the heritage value. Users can send text to the public account, without privacy risk. Findings – Spreading with help from a local non-government organization, the invations of the wechat <b>public</b> <b>service</b> <b>account</b> received amazing amount of attention, which, according to automatic web statistics, reached up to 40, 000. About 150 people followed the Wechat public account. At last we received nearly 1000 photos and hand-painted pictures. About half of our users are from Shangrila local community, Their uploaded files including historical photos of the community, providing us local perspective with long period of concern. The other half users come from travlers from all over the world, mostly from China but also european people. Their photos and paintings also contribute to the memory construction. Implications –The widespread use of smart mobile devices can make individuals more active as participants of public fairs, with the premise of carefully designed infrastructure. In this way, new technologies may contribute to a people centred principle in our conservation and design process. Value – Our approach is so-called Volunteered Geographic Information(VGI) (Goodchild, 2007) in collecting memory fragments for post-disaster construction. By convenience of uploading photos and texts from mobile devices, we successfully involved local people and travlers‘participation.

40|$|Abstract: Despite a broad {{consensus}} {{on the need to}} account for the value of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> and geographical cost of living differences on the measurement of poverty, there is little reliable evidence on how these factors actually affect poverty estimates. Unlike the standard approach in studies of the distribution of <b>public</b> <b>services,</b> this paper employs a method for valuing sector-specific local <b>public</b> <b>services</b> that <b>accounts</b> for differences between municipalities in the costs and capacity to produce <b>public</b> <b>services.</b> Furthermore, recipient frequencies in various demographic groups are used as the basis for determining the allocation of the value of these services on citizens of the municipalities. Geographical differences in living costs are accounted for by using municipal housing price indices or by replacing the country-specific poverty line with municipal-specific poverty lines. Applying Norwegian register data for the period 1993 - 2001, we find that disregarding the value of local <b>public</b> <b>services</b> and geographic cost of living differences yields a misleading picture of poverty.

40|$|Corruption {{features}} {{prominently in}} {{assessments of the}} governance, performance and capacity of South Africa’s <b>public</b> <b>service.</b> However, <b>accounts</b> of corruption too often fail to offer systematic appraisals of its occurrence within the diverse institutional makeup of the <b>public</b> <b>service.</b> This article seeks to address this gap by investigating {{the relationship between the}} level and type of corruption, and the institutional characteristics of government departments. Based on an original dataset which assembles published data on financial misconduct, staffing and budgetary information, the article examines whether the institutional makeup of national departments render some more susceptible to corruption than others. The findings highlight the multidimensional nature of corruption, indicating that departmental risk should not simply be judged on its cumulative or aggregate effect: how much corruption do departments sustain, but incorporate the proportional effect of corruption: how much does it matter? Indicators such as overall staff size, ratio of supervisory to non-supervisory staff and functional orientation are necessary but insufficient indicators of corruption risk, whilst budget size appears to have little bearing on increased risk; although there is more, though not unequivocal, reason to be concerned about departments with a higher percentage of their budgets allocated to goods and services spending...|$|R

The modernization agenda encouraged a process of organizational development (e.g., formal restructuring of <b>public</b> <b>services),</b> but the <b>accounting</b> workforce itself was very small and highly centralized, and therefore almost identical with the project group.

To ensure that the <b>public</b> <b>service</b> acts {{in the interests of the}} public it serves and secures the public interest, a system of governance, including monitoring and evaluation, is required. Governance occurs at various levels from the State to particular public organisations. The paper addresses the accountability of public accounting officers and authorities for their public finance responsibilities on the basis of performance (including finance) reports in the State and public governance contexts. The article aims to examine appropriateness of public finance management in the State and public governance contexts. The article’s objectives are, firstly, to establish the nature of public sector finance in the context of State governance, secondly, to determine the requirements for public finance management in public organisations in the context of public governance and, thirdly, to address aspects such as the financial responsibilities, accountability, monitoring and reporting relevant to public organisations’ governing bodies. am 201...|$|R
