50|$|The <b>pitchover</b> {{maneuver}} {{consists of}} the rocket gimbaling its engine slightly to direct some of its thrust to one side. This force creates a net torque on the ship, turning {{it so that it}} no longer points vertically. The <b>pitchover</b> angle varies with the launch vehicle and is included in the rocket's inertial guidance system. For some vehicles it is only a few degrees, while other vehicles use relatively large angles (a few tens of degrees). After the <b>pitchover</b> is complete, the engines are reset to point straight down the axis of the rocket again. This small steering maneuver is the only time during an ideal gravity turn ascent that thrust must be used for purposes of steering. The <b>pitchover</b> maneuver serves two purposes. First, it turns the rocket slightly so that its flight path is no longer vertical, and second, it places the rocket on the correct heading for its ascent to orbit. After the <b>pitchover,</b> the rocket's angle of attack is adjusted to zero for the remainder of its climb to orbit. This zeroing of the angle of attack reduces lateral aerodynamic loads and produces negligible lift force during the ascent.|$|E

50|$|The gravity turn is {{commonly}} used with launch vehicles such as a rocket or the Space Shuttle that launch vertically. The rocket begins by flying straight up, gaining both vertical speed and altitude. During {{this portion of the}} launch, gravity acts directly against the thrust of the rocket, lowering its vertical acceleration. Losses associated with this slowing are known as gravity drag, and can be minimized by executing the next phase of the launch, the <b>pitchover</b> maneuver, as soon as possible. The <b>pitchover</b> should also be carried out while the vertical velocity is small to avoid large aerodynamic loads on the vehicle during the maneuver.|$|E
50|$|On September 11, 1991, Continental Express Flight 2574, {{flown by}} Britt Airways, was a {{scheduled}} domestic passenger flight from Laredo International Airport in Laredo, Texas to Houston Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas. The Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia crashed {{as it was}} descending towards Houston, killing all 14 people on board. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that an improperly-maintained horizontal stabilizer failed during approach, causing a severe nose-down <b>pitchover</b> and breakup of the plane.|$|E
50|$|Many {{signals of}} {{interest}} have a {{distribution of energy}} thatvaries in time and frequency. For example, any sound signalhaving a beginning or an end has an energy distribution thatvaries in time, and most sounds exhibit considerablevariation in both time and frequency over their duration.Time-frequency representations are commonly used to analyzeor characterize such signals. They map the one-dimensionaltime-domain signal into a two-dimensional function of timeand frequency. A time-frequency representation describes thevariation of spectral energy distribution over time, much asa musical score describes the variation of musical <b>pitchover</b> time.|$|E
50|$|In July 2013, a Proton-M/DM-03 {{carrying}} three GLONASS satellites failed {{shortly after}} liftoff. The booster began pitching {{left and right}} along the vertical axis within {{a few seconds of}} launch. Attempts by the onboard guidance computer to correct the flight trajectory failed and ended up putting it into an unrecoverable <b>pitchover.</b> The upper stages and payload were stripped off 24 seconds after launch due to the forces experienced followed by the first stage breaking apart and erupting in flames. Impact with the ground occurred 30 seconds after liftoff.|$|E

"The {{failure of}} Continental Express {{maintenance}} and inspection personnel {{to adhere to}} proper maintenance and quality assurance procedures for the airplane's horizontal stabilizer de-ice boots {{that led to the}} sudden in-flight loss of the partially secured left horizontal stabilizer leading edge and the immediate severe nose-down <b>pitchover</b> and breakup of the airplane. Contributing to the cause of the accident was the failure of the Continental Express management to ensure compliance with the approved maintenance procedures, and the failure of FAA surveillance to detect and verify compliance with approved procedures." ...|$|E
5000|$|The first HTV-2 {{flight was}} {{launched}} on 22 April 2010. The HTV-2 glider was to fly 4800 mi across the Pacific to Kwajalein at Mach 20. The launch was successful, {{but the first}} mission was not completed as planned. Reports stated that contact had been lost with the vehicle nine minutes into the mission. [...] In mid-November, DARPA revealed that the test flight had ended when the computer autopilot had [...] "commanded flight termination". According to a DARPA spokesman, [...] "When the onboard system detects or unsafe flight behavior, it forces itself into a controlled roll and <b>pitchover</b> to descend directly into the ocean." [...] Reviews found that the craft had begun to roll violently.|$|E
50|$|After the <b>pitchover,</b> the rocket's {{flight path}} {{is no longer}} {{completely}} vertical, so gravity acts to turn the flight path back towards the ground. If the rocket were not producing thrust, the flight path would be a simple ellipse like a thrown ball (it's a common mistake to {{think it is a}} parabola: it is only true if you assume that Earth is flat, and gravity always points in the same direction, which is a good approximation for short distances), leveling off and then falling back to the ground. The rocket is producing thrust though, and rather than leveling off and then descending again, by the time the rocket levels off, it has gained sufficient altitude and velocity to place it in a stable orbit.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the rocket}} is a {{multi-stage}} system where stages fire sequentially, the rocket's ascent burn {{may not be}} continuous. Obviously, some time must be allowed for stage separation and engine ignition between each successive stage, but some rocket designs call for extra free-flight time between stages. This is particularly useful in very high thrust rockets, where if the engines were fired continuously, the rocket would run out of fuel before leveling off and reaching a stable orbit above the atmosphere. [...] The technique is also useful when launching from a planet with a thick atmosphere, such as the Earth. Because gravity turns the flight path during free flight, the rocket can use a smaller initial <b>pitchover</b> angle, giving it higher vertical velocity, and taking {{it out of the}} atmosphere more quickly. This reduces both aerodynamic drag as well as aerodynamic stress during launch. Then later during the flight the rocket coasts between stage firings, allowing it to level off above the atmosphere, so when the engine fires again, at zero angle of attack, the thrust accelerates the ship horizontally, inserting it into orbit.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} dynamic electrothermal {{model for}} the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) total, nonscanning channels is formulated. This model is then used to accurately simulate two types of dynamic solar observation: the solar calibration and the so-called <b>pitchover</b> maneuver. Using a second model, the nonscanner active cavity radiometer (ACR) thermal noise is studied. This study reveals that radiative emission and scattering by the surrounding parts of the nonscanner cavity are acceptably small. The dynamic electrothermal model {{is also used to}} compute ACR instrument transfer function. Accurate in-flight measurement of this transfer function is shown to depend on the energy distribution over the frequency spectrum of the radiation input function. A new array-type field of view limiter, whose geometry controls the input function, is proposed for in-flight calibration of an ACR and other types of radiometers. The point spread function (PSF) of the ERBE and the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) scanning radiometers is computed. The PSF is useful in characterizing the channel optics. It also has potential for recovering the distribution of the radiative flux from Earth by deconvolution...|$|E
40|$|End-to-end {{integration}} {{tests are}} critical risk reduction efforts for any complex vehicle. Phasing tests are an end-to-end integrated test that validates system directional phasing (polarity) from sensor measurement through software algorithms to end effector response. Phasing tests are typically performed on a fully integrated and assembled flight vehicle where sensors are stimulated {{by moving the}} vehicle and the effectors are observed for proper polarity. Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) Pad Abort 1 (PA- 1) Phasing Test was conducted from inertial measurement to Launch Abort System (LAS). Orion Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT- 1) has two end-to-end phasing tests planned. The first test from inertial measurement to Crew Module (CM) reaction control system thrusters uses navigation and flight control system software algorithms to process commands. The second test from inertial measurement to CM S-Band Phased Array Antenna (PAA) uses navigation and communication system software algorithms to process commands. Future Orion flights include Ascent Abort Flight Test 2 (AA- 2) and Exploration Mission 1 (EM- 1). These flights will include additional or updated sensors, software algorithms and effectors. This paper will explore the implementation of end-to-end phasing tests on a flight vehicle which has many constraints, trade-offs and compromises. Orion PA- 1 Phasing Test was conducted at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) from March 4 - 6, 2010. This test decreased the risk of mission failure by demonstrating proper flight control system polarity. Demonstration was achieved by stimulating the primary navigation sensor, processing sensor data to commands and viewing propulsion response. PA- 1 primary navigation sensor was a Space Integrated Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) (SIGI) which has onboard processing, INS (3 accelerometers and 3 rate gyros) and no GPS receiver. SIGI data was processed by GN&C software into thrust magnitude and direction commands. The processing changes through three phases of powered flight: <b>pitchover,</b> downrange and reorientation. The primary inputs to GN&C are attitude position, attitude rates, angle of attack (AOA) and angle of sideslip (AOS). Pitch and yaw attitude and attitude rate responses were verified by using a flight spare SIGI mounted to a 2 -axis rate table. AOA and AOS responses were verified by using a data recorded from SIGI movements on a robotic arm located at NASA Johnson Space Center. The data was consolidated and used in an open-loop data input to the SIGI. Propulsion was the Launch Abort System (LAS) Attitude Control Motor (ACM) which consisted of a solid motor with 8 nozzles. Each nozzle has active thrust control by varying throat area with a pintle. LAS ACM pintles are observable through optically transparent nozzle covers. SIGI movements on robot arm, SIGI rate table movements and LAS ACM pintle responses were video recorded as test artifacts for analysis and evaluation. The PA- 1 Phasing Test design was determined based on test performance requirements, operational restrictions and EGSE capabilities. This development progressed during different stages. For convenience these development stages are initial, working group, tiger team, Engineering Review Team (ERT) and final...|$|E
