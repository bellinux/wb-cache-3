5|$|When the {{announcer}} {{at the ball}} asks {{if there is a}} doctor in the house, Mac <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> up, to Caroline's embarrassment. Things get more embarrassing when Guy also volunteers, and asks why Caroline is sitting next to Mac when she is Guy's fiancée. A unconscious patient lies on an operating table. Guy touches her breasts, takes pictures of her naked body under the blanket, and kisses her. Caroline alleges that the patient is transgender, which repels Guy. Sue White then appears in a tutu, claiming that the patient is stalking Mac, and repeating the assertion that the patient is transgender.|$|E
25|$|That night Walt goes to {{the gang}} members' house, where they draw their weapons on him. He loudly berates them and enumerates their crimes, drawing the {{attention}} of the neighbors. Putting a cigarette in his mouth, he asks for a light, then <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in his jacket and provocatively pulls it out as if he were holding a gun, causing the gang members to shoot and kill him. As he falls to the ground, his hand opens to reveal the Zippo cigarette lighter with the 1st Cavalry insignia; he was unarmed. His plan had in fact been to provoke them into killing him in public. Sue, following Walt's directions, frees Thao, and they drive to the scene in Walt's Gran Torino. One of the police officers tells them that all gang members have been placed under arrest for the murder, and due to the number of witnesses, they all face a lengthy stay in prison.|$|E
2500|$|Lawrence rewrote many of {{his novels}} several times to perfect them and {{similarly}} he returned {{to some of his}} early poems when they were collected in 1928. This was in part to fictionalise them, but also to remove some of the artifice of his first works. As he put in himself: [...] "A young man is afraid of his demon and <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> over the demon's mouth sometimes and speaks for him." [...] His best-known poems are probably those dealing with nature such as those in the collection Birds, Beasts and Flowers, including the Tortoise poems, and [...] "Snake", one of his most frequently anthologised, displays some of his most frequent concerns: those of man's modern distance from nature and subtle hints at religious themes.|$|E
60|$|He <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>'and</b> to Bill's {{pocket and}} took out a little green snake; then he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>'and</b> to Bill's trouser-pocket {{and took out}} a frog, while pore Bill's eyes looked as if they was corning out o' their sockets.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said little}} Abraham, brightly, from the window-bench; [...] "and I seed it! {{and it did}} twinkle when he <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> up to <b>his</b> mistarshers. Mother, why did our grand {{relation}} keep on <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> up to <b>his</b> mistarshers?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} slipped from the table, and lounged to the door. The Doctor <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in <b>his</b> pockets and {{followed}} him. The young man, {{as if in}} unconscious imitation, had <b>put</b> <b>HIS</b> <b>hands</b> in <b>his</b> pockets also, and looked at him.|$|R
2500|$|The film {{switches}} to [...] "2 Metaphor". At the Nyon lakefront Davidson {{is sitting on}} a bench looking through a book of Nicolas de Staël reproductions when Marie and her boyfriend arrive to say goodbye before they go to the United States. Ivitch arrives, dressed like Davidson in matching trench coat and hat. While the two discuss the tyranny of images, the German speaking man arrives and the scene plays out as before: he accosts Ivitch, fires his gun, and leaves. As before, a man approaches the shaken woman. This time it is the man that is offscreen and the woman who is onscreen (Ivitch behind metal bars – an image frequently used in promotion of the film). The man, Marcus, <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on the bars and declares, [...] "I am at your service." ...|$|E
2500|$|J.T., {{wounded and}} lying beside his dying brother, stays behind to {{detonate}} explosives {{to eliminate the}} remaining zombies while the others flee. The survivors make plans to escape by stealing helicopters but must fight past the remaining zombies. Abby dies, along with hope for a cure, when a ballistic projectile blows his head up. The survivors use the blade tips of their helicopter to kill the rest. However, while saving Cherry from a zombie, El Wray is fatally wounded. In the epilogue, Cherry, now sporting a minigun leg, leads the group and many more survivors to the Caribbean beach at Tulum, where they start a peaceful new society during a world-wide zombie outbreak. It is also revealed that Cherry has given birth to El Wray's daughter (alluded to earlier during El Wray's final scene when he <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on her stomach and restates his motto [...] "I never miss").|$|E

6000|$|... 'This,' <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on a backing-bell rope, 'is {{to sound}} the fire-alarm; this,' <b>putting</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on a go-ahead bell, 'is to call the texas-tender; this one,' {{indicating}} the whistle-lever, 'is to call the captain'--and so he went on, touching one object after another, and reeling off his tranquil spool of lies.|$|R
