40|$|The {{purified}} protein {{derivative of}} tuberculin (<b>PPD</b> <b>tuberculin)</b> stimulates approximately one of two lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated B-cell blasts of C 57 BL/ 6 J nu/nu spleen cells to continued clonal growth and maturation to IgM and IgG secretion. It alwo stimulates background, in vivo-activated large cells of normal C 57 BL/ 6 J nu/nu spleen to growth and Ig secretion, at a frequency of approximately 1 of 100 large spleen cells. <b>PPD</b> <b>tuberculin,</b> therefore, is a polyclonal B-cell activator for B-cell blasts. Many single murine splenic B cells (approximately 50 %) appear to have reactivities, and therefore probably receptors, for LPS and <b>PPD</b> <b>tuberculin.</b> <b>PPD</b> <b>tuberculin</b> does not stimulate small, resting B cells to growth {{as measured by the}} number of cells in culture and by thymidine uptake. However, it stimulates approximately one-fourth of all spleen cells to blast transformation. The large-size blast cells secrete IgM and, therefore, form plaques in the protein A plaque assay. IgG-secreting, plaque-forming cells develop at later stages of stimulation, indicating that the switch from IgM to IgG may occur without division in single, stimulated B cells. Stimulation of resting B cells to maturation by <b>PPD</b> <b>tuberculin</b> is polyclonal. Thus, approximately 1 in 10 (2) IgM-secreting plaque-forming cells form plaques with trinitrophenyl-substituted sheep erythrocytes, 1 in 450 do so with horse erythrocytes, and 1 in 10 (3) with sheep erythrocytes.

40|$|Abstract Background Bovine tuberculosis, {{caused by}} Mycobacterium bovis, afflicts {{approximately}} 50 million cattle worldwide and is detected by the tuberculin skin test (TST). While {{it has long}} been recognized that purified protein derivative (<b>PPD)</b> <b>tuberculin</b> is composed of a mixture of M. bovis derived protein components, {{little is known about the}} quality, relative quantity and identity of the proteins that make up <b>PPD</b> <b>tuberculin.</b> We manufactured a sterile filtered <b>PPD</b> <b>tuberculin</b> (SF-PPD) from a nine-week-old M. bovis culture supernatant in order to characterise the culture filtrate proteins (CFP) which make up M. bovis <b>PPD</b> <b>tuberculin</b> and to compare the antibody response of M. bovis infected versus M. bovis sensitized cattle. Results SF-PPD resolved into approximately 200 discrete spots using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 -DE) while fewer than 65 spots could be discerned from 2 -DE gels of tuberculin derived from autoclaved culture supernatant. Two dimensional Western blot analyses indicated that sera from M. bovis sensitized cattle recognized additional SF-PPD antigens as compared to M. bovis infected cattle at seven weeks post infection/sensitization. However, application of a comparative tuberculin skin test resulted in an antibody boosting response to the same set of M. bovis CFPs in both the M. bovis infected and M. bovis sensitized cattle. Conclusions We concluded that it is the heat sterilization of the M. bovis CFPs that causes severe structural changes to the M. bovis proteins. This work suggests that M. bovis infected cattle and cattle artificially sensitized to M. bovis with an injection of heat killed cells exhibit similar antibody responses to M. bovis antigens. </p...|$|E

40|$|Two {{major events}} {{occur in the}} {{response}} of the immune system to antigenic stimulation, proliferation of cells and secretion of soluble products. The relative importance of these two events is not well known. Mitogens have been found to provide valuable tools for analysis of these problems (for review, see reference 1). The substances most well studied are phytohemagglutinin (PHA) 1 and concanavalin A, which have been found to selectively activate thymus-derived (T) cells (2 - 6), and lipopolysaccharides of bacterial origin (LPS), which have been found to selectively activate bursal equivalent or bone marrow-derived (B) cells (2, 7).

We have previously found, under improved tissue-culture conditions for murine lymphocytes (2, 3), that one of three splenic B lymphocytes can be stimulated as a single precursor to the clonal growth and maturation of> 100 IgM-secreting cells per clone in vitro (4, 5) by the mitogens lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1 (6), lipoprotein (LP) (7), and Nocardia (NOC) (8). A major part of all these splenic B cells has, as mitogenactivated blasts, reactivities, and therefore probably receptors, for more than one of these mitogens.

The assay was performed in duplicate with two cut-off points. Dialysis of PPD reduced test sensitivity, whereas the concentration of phenol did not significantly affect test outcome. Delaying antigenic stimulation of samples > 8. h resulted in a reduction in test sensitivity, compromising the capacity of the assay to detect infected animals. Performing the assay in duplicate was unnecessary, which has implications for reducing assay costs.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{allergic}} test of mallein {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently used tests, together with the Complement Fixation Test (CFT), for the diagnosis of glanders in endemic areas. Mallein, a purified protein derivative (PPD), is produced similarly to <b>PPD</b> <b>tuberculin</b> and the end product is a primarily proteic antigen, which is only poorly purified. The immuno-allergic activity of mallein is believed to be due to a high molecular weight group of proteins present in the antigen. To improve the quality of the antigen, in terms of sensitivity and specificity, a new method of mallein production was developed, in which purification was accomplished by ultrafiltration in a Tangential Flow Filtration system (TFF). Results The TFF methodology efficiently separated the high and low molecular weight protein groups of mallein. The five TFF-purified malleins, produced from Burkholderia mallei strains isolated from clinical cases of glanders in Brazil, proved to be more potent than standard mallein in the induction of an allergic reaction in sensitized animals. Regarding specificity, two of the purified malleins were equivalent to the standard and three were less specific. Conclusion Some of the TFF-purified malleins showed considerable potential to be used as an auxiliary test in the diagnosis of glanders. </p...|$|E

Further univariate analysis also showed that smear grading and an induration size of ≥ 10 mm were independently associated with delayed smear conversion. Patients with cavitary lesions showed a higher rate of non-conversion after two months, which was not significant. We could not find any association between some of the variables, such as age, sex, weight, smoking, alcoholism, addictions, respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, alternative anti-TB treatment, and smear conversion. Conclusion: Intensified treatment and precautions against transmission should be especially considered for TB patients with high smear grading and an induration size of more than 10 mm...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The {{incidence}} of tuberculosis is increased in HIV positive patients. Purified protein derivative (<b>PPD,</b> <b>tuberculin)</b> testing {{has not been}} performed routinely on patients infected with HIV in the UK and its usefulness in diagnosing tuberculosis in these patients is unclear. METHODS [...] 198 HIV positive patients were Tine tested and a CD 4 + lymphocyte count and chest radiograph were performed. Of the 179 male patients 164 were homosexual or bisexual, 11 were injecting drug users (IDUs), and four were both homosexual and IDUs. Of 19 women 14 were heterosexual and five were IDUs. Patients assessed their own skin reactions at 72 hours, recording the grade on a card which was returned by post. Patients with a grade 0 reaction were requested {{to have a second}} test one month later. RESULTS [...] Details were available on 168 of the 198 patients. Grade 0 reactions occurred in 89 of the 168 patients, requiring a second Tine test, and 73 completed Tine 2 results were received. Of 57 patients with CD 4 + lymphocyte counts below 200 /mm 3, low grade PPD reactivity was seen in 18 on Tine 1 and nine on Tine 2. No history of BCG immunisation of tuberculosis was found in 33 Tine positive patients. Two patients treated for tuberculosis in the previous six months were PPD positive with CD 4 + counts of 60 /mm 3 and 4 /mm 3 respectively. CONCLUSIONS [...] PPD reactivity may be maintained despite a CD 4 + count of 100 /mm 3 or less when there is a history of tuberculosis or BCG immunisation...|$|E
40|$|Themycobacterial immunodominant ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10 antigens are {{strongly}} recognizable in tuberculosis-infected cattle, {{and they do}} not elicit a response in cattle without infection. In addition, they are absent in most environmental mycobacterial spe-cies, and therefore, their use can be an alternative to purified protein derivative (<b>PPD)</b> <b>tuberculin</b> {{in the development of a}} more specific skin diagnostic test in cattle. The aim of the current study was to assess the potential of an ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10 (E 6 -C 10) protein cocktail in a skin test format in naturally tuberculosis-infected and paratuberculosis-infected cattle. We also included MPB 83 as a third component in one of the protein cocktail preparations. The protein cocktail was tested at different dose con-centrations (5, 10, and 15 g per protein). The best skin response to the E 6 -C 10 protein cocktail was obtained with 10 g. Subse-quently, this concentration was tested in 2 herds with high and low bovine tuberculosis prevalence, the latter with paratubercu-losis coinfection. Our data show that the E 6 -C 10 cocktail allows identification of an important proportion of animals that PPDB is not able to recognize, especially in low-prevalence herds. The protein cocktail did not induce reactions in tuberculosis-free cattle or in paratuberculosis-infected cattle. Addition of MPB 83 to the protein cocktail did not make any difference in the skin reaction. Bovine tuberculosis (TB) control requires identification andremoval of infected animals from the herd. The primary diag-nostic test is the tuberculin skin test (TST) (25). TST is based on the measurement of the skin thickness increment 72 h after th...|$|E
40|$|The {{intradermal}} {{tuberculin tests}} and the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) assay {{are the principal}} tests used worldwide for the ante-mortem diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. The conventional reagent currently in use in these tests is purified protein derivative (<b>PPD)</b> <b>tuberculin</b> obtained from Mycobacterium bovis culture. The components of PPD are poorly characterized and difficult to standardize. To overcome this issue, antigens specific to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex are being studied. Here we have assessed the biological potency of ESAT- 6, CFP- 10 and Rv- 3615 c presented as peptide or recombinant protein cocktails {{in comparison with the}} standard bovine PPD used routinely in Spanish eradication campaigns. The study was performed in cattle (n= 23) from a herd with natural M. bovis infection. Animals were simultaneously injected with PPD and the peptide and protein cocktails. The percentages of cattle reacting positively to single intradermal test were 60. 9 % (bovine PPD), 47. 8 % (peptide cocktail) and 60. 9 % (protein cocktail), with {{no significant difference between the}} actual skin fold thickness increases (p> 0. 05). The IFN-γ assay detected 60. 9 % of animals when stimulation was performed with bovine PPD, but decreased to 52. 2 % when stimulation was performed with the peptide cocktail and to 47. 8 % when stimulation was performed with the protein cocktail. However, no significant differences were found between IFN-γ responder frequencies (p> 0. 05). These results show a potential use of these defined reagents for in vivo tuberculosis diagnosis.
