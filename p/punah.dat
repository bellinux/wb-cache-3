3000|$|These {{problems}} in Hudson’s interpretation of Dhṛtarāṣṭra {{could have been}} avoided had she read the Kaṇikanīti, a passage of 230 lines found in the vulgate. 29 Although in the vulgate rather than the critical edition, this text should not be dismissed lightly, for the vulgate, as Madeleine Biardeau argues, represents the best guide to the epic’s interpretation. The Indian tradition is a text-commentarial tradition; ideas do not appear from just anywhere, but are developed within a strictly controlled system of commentary, meta-commentary, and sub-commentary. The Mahābhārata’s later recensions, as argued elsewhere (Adluri and Bagchee 2017), are not simply instances of uncontrolled contamination; they are the first glosses on the archetypal text. In the passage under consideration, we are offered a completely different view of Dhṛtarāṣṭra than the one Hudson works out so painstakingly. Dhṛtarāṣṭra is a hypocrite, an utterer of sanctimonious bromides, begrudging of others’ success, jealous of his privileges, and {{always on the lookout for}} bad counsel that will justify his actions. Kaṇika, the king’s minister, tells Dhṛtarāṣṭra that strong kings should never hesitate to render harmless their foes, whether through bribery, conciliation, warfare, or treachery. Kaṇika’s advice resonates well with the king, who queries him ardently on what he should do, either by bribery, or by sowing dissension, or by force, to destroy the enemy (kathaṃ sāntvena dānena bhedair daṇḍena vā <b>punaḥ</b> | amitraḥ śakyate hantuṃ tan me brūhi yathātatham, App. 1, no. 81, lines 49 – 50). Kaṇika responds by comparing the king’s position with a jackal, fully acquainted with the science of politics (nītiśāstra, App. 1, no. 81, line 52), who, even though surrounded by stronger, braver, and nobler animals, is able to assert his authority. Kaṇika’s choice of the jackal, known from the Pañcatantra for its cunning and ruthlessness, shows that he has correctly discerned the king’s nature. It is also the first time in the epic that Dhṛtarāṣṭra listens to an advisor’s counsel. By not taking seriously the view of Dhṛtarāṣṭra canonical in the continuing tradition, Hudson commits avoidable mistakes. 30 [...]...|$|E
