5|$|Selenium {{deficiency}} {{is rare in}} otherwise healthy, well-nourished individuals. It {{can occur}} in patients with severely compromised intestinal function, those undergoing total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition,</b> and in those of advanced age (over 90). Also, people dependent on food grown from selenium-deficient soil are at risk. Although New Zealand soil has low levels of selenium, adverse health effects have not been detected in the residents.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been reported {{as a consequence of}} non-molybdenum supplemented total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate, {{in much the same way}} as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. However (presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{history of}} {{nutrition}} support in Brazil {{is parallel to}} its development in the world. Inspired by the publications of the surgical group headed by Professor Rhoads at the University of Pennsylvania, a group of Brazil-ian physicians pioneered the beginning of parenteral nutri-tion (PN) therapy. The Brazilian Society of <b>Parenteral</b> and Enteral <b>Nutrition</b> (SBNPE) was officially founded in 1975. Soon, scientific contributions started to appear, reflected by articles in the Journal of <b>Parenteral</b> and Enteral <b>Nutrition</b> and other journals and by books. In many states of Brazil, nutrition support services were created to carry out scientific and educational activities. The relationship with the Ameri-can Society of <b>Parenteral</b> and Enteral <b>Nutrition</b> was funda-mental {{in the development of}} clinical nutrition in Brazil because of the strong scientific exchange between the Unite...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Background: We {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} multi-layered bags vs ethylvinyl-acetate bags on peroxidate forma-tion of various emulsions for all-in-one total parenteral nutri-tion solutions (TPN) during storage. Methods: Twenty-four <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutritions</b> were prepared with 4 commercial IV lipid emulsions (Soyacal 20 %, Grifols; Intralipid 20 %, Frese-nius-Kabi; Lipofundina 20 %, Braun; and Clinoleic 20 %, Clin-tex) and 2 different bags (multilayered [ML] bag, Miramed; and 1 ethylvinyl-acetate [EVA] bag, Miramed). Each kind of TPN was prepared in triplicate. Samples were taken at 3 different times: immediately after preparation (time 0), after 6 days at 4 °C and 48 hours at 37 °C (time 1), and finally after a total of 14 days at 37 °C (time 2). Oxidation of TPN was evaluated by analysis of hydroperoxides by ferrous oxidation–xylenol orange (FOX) reactive, lipoperoxides b...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} {{to enhance}} the solubilty of various poorly water soluble drugs and this enhancing the bioavailability throught uitilization of the SolEmuls®-technology has been achieved. It could be proven, that the SolEmuls®-technology is suited to transform a range of poorly water soluble drugs into biologically active and sufficiently long-term stable formulations. The advantages of the SolEmuls®-technology became obvious: easy formulation process, cost effective technology and easy scaling up ability. Apart from that, this work also showed the good usability for parenteral fat emulsions as drugcarriers, because of their extreme long-term stability (18 years). Even after a storage period of 18 years, the emulsions were still in general stable and of the appropriate particlesize. Although some of the emulsions showed signs of flocculation or sedimentation, which {{on the other hand}} could be easily taken out of the equation by filtering the emulsion, leaving a product still in the desired particle size range. Though the emulsions were no longer suitable for <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutritions</b> purposes, they remained well suited for use as drug carriers...|$|R

25|$|There is no {{specific}} {{treatment for the}} canine distemper. As with measles, the treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The supportive care is geared towards treating fluid/electrolyte imbalances, neurological symptoms, and preventing any secondary bacterial infections.

25|$|Treatment {{involves}} {{administration of}} {{large volumes of}} intravenous fluids, which can become very costly. Antibiotics are often given if deemed appropriate based on the presumed underlying cause and the horse's CBC results. Therapy to help prevent endotoxemia and improve blood protein levels (plasma or synthetic colloid administration) may also be used if budgetary constraints allow. Other therapies include probiotics and anti-inflammatory medication. Horses that are not eating well may also require <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition.</b> Horses usually require 3–6 days of treatment before clinical signs improve.|$|E

25|$|Central IV {{lines have}} their {{catheters}} that are advanced through a vein and empty {{into a large}} central vein (a vein within the torso), usually the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava or even the right atrium of the heart. Because these veins have a larger diameter than peripheral veins and have faster blood flow, central lines are commonly used to administer substances that could irritate the blood vessel lining, such as some chemotherapy drugs and total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition,</b> whose high glucose content can damage blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} survive a tetanus infection, the {{maintenance}} of an airway and proper nutrition are required. An intake of 3,500 to 4,000 calories and at least 150g of protein per day is often given in liquid form through a tube directly into the stomach (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), or through a drip into a vein (<b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition).</b> This high-caloric diet maintenance is required because of the increased metabolic strain {{brought on by the}} increased muscle activity. Full recovery takes 4 to 6 weeks because the body must regenerate destroyed nerve axon terminals.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{following}} the surgery, {{the patient is}} placed in an intensive care unit for monitoring, normally {{for a period of}} a few days. The patient is put on a ventilator to assist breathing. Nutritional needs are generally met via total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition,</b> although in some cases a nasogastric tube is sufficient for feeding. Chest tubes are put in so that excess fluids may be removed. Because the patient is confined to bed, a urinary catheter is used. IV lines are used in the neck and arm for monitoring and giving medications.|$|E

There is no cure for intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Different types of surgery and treatment managing life-threatening complications such as ileus and volvulus, intestinal stasis which lead to bacterial overgrowth, and resection of affected or dead parts of the gut may be needed.

25|$|Malnutrition, <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> and {{malabsorption}} {{can lead}} to osteoporosis. Nutritional and gastrointestinal disorders that can predispose to osteoporosis include undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (both symptomatic and asymptomatic people), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, cystic fibrosis, surgery (after gastrectomy, intestinal bypass surgery or bowel resection) and severe liver disease (especially primary biliary cirrhosis). People with lactose intolerance or milk allergy may develop osteoporosis due to restrictions of calcium-containing foods. Individuals with bulimia can also develop osteoporosis. Those with an otherwise adequate calcium intake can develop osteoporosis due to the inability to absorb calcium and/or vitamin D. Other micronutrients such as vitamin K or vitamin B12 deficiency may also contribute.|$|E
25|$|Many diets {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{for the management of}} Crohn's disease, and many do improve symptoms, but none have been proven to cure the disease. The specific carbohydrate diet usually requires adjustments by patients; if a patient finds that certain foods increase or decrease symptoms, they may adjust their diet accordingly. A food diary is recommended to see what positive or negative effects particular foods have. A low residue diet may be used to reduce the volume of stools excreted daily. People with lactose intolerance due to small bowel disease may benefit from avoiding lactose-containing foods. Patients who cannot eat may be given total <b>parenteral</b> <b>nutrition</b> (TPN), a source of vitamins and nutrients.|$|E
