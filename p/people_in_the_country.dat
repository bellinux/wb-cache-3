5|$|In Cambodia, {{the deeply}} rooted {{tradition}} {{of using the}} Bengal and pygmy slow lorises in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. Some <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> believe dried slow loris can cure cancer. Slow lorises are also smoked for other traditional remedies. Traditional Khmer medicine practitioners in that region claim that medicines made from slow lorises can cure 100diseases, with some practitioners from the National Centre for Traditional Medicine reporting that slow loris are sometimes roasted alive {{under the assumption that}} this increases the medicine's potency. Slow lorises are also burned alive, causing their eyes to burst and release a liquid called minyak kukang (or loris oil), which is used in black magic and traditional medicine and is supposed to have life-giving qualities and act as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportion}} {{of people living}} under poverty line was 60.5 per cent in 2010 compared to 62.8 per cent in 2006 as per the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS). The extremely poor formed 42.3 per cent {{of the total population}} as against 42.7 per cent in 2007. Around two per cent of the population was disabled, 35 per cent of which is accounted to diseases. Out of the disabled, 90.2 per cent were employed and the literacy rate of the disabled population remained at 58.6 per cent compared to the general literacy rate of 70.2 per cent. Albinism is a condition where people have little or no pigment in their eyes, skin or hair.

5|$|By April 1955 the Guatemalan government's foreign {{exchange}} reserves had declined from $42million {{at the end of}} 1954 to just $3.4million. The regime was thus facing difficulties borrowing money, leading to capital flight. The government also received criticism for the presence of black markets and other signs of approaching bankruptcy. By the end of 1954 the number of unemployed <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> had risen to 20,000, four times higher than it had been during the latter years of the Árbenz government. In April 1955 the Eisenhower administration approved an aid package of $53million and began to underwrite the debt of the Guatemalan government. Although officials in the USgovernment complained about Castillo Armas's incompetence and corruption, he also received praise in that country for acting against communists, and his human rights violations generally went unremarked. In 1955, during a corn famine, Castillo Armas gave corn import licences to some of his old fighters in return for a $25,000 bribe. The imported corn, upon inspection by the United Nations, turned out to be unfit for consumption. When a student newspaper exposed the story, Castillo Armas launched a police crackdown against those criticizing him. Castillo Armas returned some of the privileges that the United Fruit Company had had under Ubico, but the company did not benefit substantially from them; it went into a gradual decline following disastrous experiments with breeding and pesticides, falling demand, and an anti-trust action.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} to the disturbance brought locally heavy rainfall to the Yucatán Peninsula, with a maximum of 7.09inches (18cm) in Lázaro Cárdenas, Quintana Roo. The depression produced intense precipitation across central and eastern Cuba, peaking at 12.4inches (31.5cm) in Topes de Collantes. In Victoria de Las Tunas, a rainfall total of 8.6inches (21.8cm) set the new record most rainfall in 24hours. The rainfall caused flooding of rivers and lakes behind dams, and in some places, residents required rescue from the roofs of their houses. Officials forced the evacuation of 40,000people in several provinces, and across the country, the storm destroyed 1,860homes and damaged 16,500more. The flooding blocked mountainous highways in Santiago de Cuba Province, and in Las Tunas Province railway lines were damaged. Widespread crop damage occurred just {{two months after the}} Storm of the Century left similar heavy damage. The flooding damaged 87sugar production centers. The depression killed seven <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> with another five missing, as reported by a newspaper on the day after the depression left the island. After the storm passed, the Cuban government activated the Civil Defense, while National Relief Services worked to rescue all people affected by the flooding.|$|E
5|$|In Belize, the {{rainfall}} in {{one week}} represented the average monthly values at some stations. Heavy rainfall from the depression caused levels to rise along rivers and creeks. A bridge that had been rebuilt following earlier Tropical Storm Arthur was flooded, prompting the Belize Defence Force to assist in crossings. This isolated much of Cayo District {{from the rest of}} the country until the bridge was repaired. On the western portion of the district, flooding along the Macal River damaged a bridge crossing into northern Guatemala, which restricted traffic only to people returning home. Levels along the Macal and the Belize River were higher than the floods of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, but less than that of Hurricane Keith in 2000. The floods caused residents to evacuate after over 1,000homes were flooded; 311people stayed in shelters, while the remainder stayed with families and relatives. Of the affected houses, 12 were destroyed and 802 were severely damaged. Most of the affected population was in rural areas of western Belize. One village in Orange Walk District had to be quarantined due to the health threat from the floods for 25days. Many roads were closed, and there were widespread school closures. Overall, the floods killed two <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> and caused BZ$54.1million (BZD, $27.1million USD) in damage. Most of the damage was agricultural, accounting for BZ$28.2million (BZD, $14.1million USD), or 25% of the country's agricultural gross domestic product. Other damage included BZ$11.7million (BZD, $6.3million USD) to roads and bridges. The ongoing floods caused BZ$2.7million (BZD, $1.5million USD) in tourism losses, due to closed facilities and water damage.|$|E
