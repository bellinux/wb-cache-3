40|$|Abstract The {{topic of}} punitive damages {{presents}} {{a number of}} interesting and challenging research issues especially on a comparative perspective. Punitive damages, as they are described in the Restatement Second of Tort, are defined as damages other than compensatory awarded in a private civil action against a person to punish him for the outrageous conduct and to deter the wrongdoer and others form committing similar acts in the future. This doctrine is a well established and time-honored feature of the common law tradition which has always been familiar with a dualistic concept of damages mirroring the fact that tort law is endowed not only with a compensatory aim but also with punishment and deterrent aims. Differently, the civil law tradition has a purely monistic approach since damages are strictly limited to achieve compensation, while punitive and deterrence purposes belong to a different branch of law. For this reason, punitive damages are disfavored since they are deemed to be {{in contrast with the}} principle of compensation which has been promoted as a fundamental and mandatory principle governing the civil liability system. This gap between common law and civil law over punitive damages comes out also when looking at the recognition and enforcement of common law punitive judgments in civil law countries. Our civil courts, indeed, have traditionally denied the enforcement of punitive damages decisions {{in the name of the}} compensation dogma; especially stating that punitive damages are in contrast with the ordre public. So, most part of the civil law countries have built up a kind of a bulwark through the compensation dogma to ban any possible contacts with punitive aspects of the tort law system. Face to this gap the aim of this work is twofold: first, the outstanding point is to verify whether the compensatory rule brought out by the civil law countries is definitely the real hindrance and barrier to the acknowledgment of a kind of punitive aim within the civil law tort system. Secondly, it is important to find out the chance of a closer relationship between common law and civil law worlds over the issue of punitive damages especially in light of a new comparative-globalized approach on tort law. The chance of carrying on these work hypothesis is given by comparative law as a method of observation of realty which makes aware that just in the field of punitive damages there are ever-growing and constant changes both in common law and in civil law. This is true especially in light of the debatable intervention of the United States Supreme Court on punitive damages and in light of the rise up of new trends in the Italian tort system showing that probably, in certain situations, the compensation theory is too weak to rule alone. To this end, I began with a general portray of the historical English background which reveals that the origins of punitive damages come form the ancient unity of tort and crime during the Anglo-Saxon period (V century B. C.). The connection between tort and crime is really important since it has never been abandoned, neither to date nor when the common was born in 1066; so it is not surprising that an institution halfway between civil law and criminal law has become part of the common law legal system. What is noteworthy is that in the historical path running form the Anglo-Saxons times until the birth of the common law, the most part of English cases dealing with punitive damages was concerned with cases involving the violation to liberty, honour and the dignity of a private citizen. In sum, in their first applicability punitive damages began to be combined with the need to protect a private right against all kind of abuses especially abuses of power by the Crown. The two landmark cases which can testify this earlier workability of punitive damages date back to 1763 and they are Wilkes v. Wood and Huckle v. Money. In both cases a British court awarded punitive damages against the Crown's agents for unlawful search and seizure of the plaintiffs' home and newspaper. Exemplary damages were awarded on the grounds that actual damages would have been insufficient to punish the Crown for the wrong committed against a citizen's private right and deter this type of conduct by the Crown's agents in the future. The final and actual setting of English punitive damages doctrine was achieved in 1964, with Rookes v. Barnard and in 2001 with Kuddus case. With these cases we assist both to an attempt to limit punitive damages making them more predictable and fairer in their amounts, and to expand the range of cases in which they can be awarded. Once punitive damages became widely available English courts began put further limits establishing a maximum amount of punitive damages of 50, 000 pounds and ratio limit of no more than 3 times the compensatory damages. So, to date in England punitive damages are carefully supervised while they still remain a traditional feature of the English tort law. As far as the situation in United States is concerned, punitive damages appeared later and at the very beginning, around 1784 the American tort law followed the English inheritance of exemplary damages. Indeed, in most part of the early American opinions it is evident that punitive damages were awarded as a kind of revenge for the poor against the aggression of power and violence. Punitive damages indeed were assessed as punishment for intentional and malicious acts involving property, reputation and violation of liberty by those who are more powerful. Moreover, they were levied in a variety of cases involving a societally recognized inequity between the plaintiff and the defendant. The first relevant cases showing such inheritance dates back to 1784 with Genay. v. Norris and to 1791 Coryell v. Calbaught. Indeed, both cases dealt with the infringement of the honour of the victims. Later, around the end of the XIX century the situation changed and punitive damages in United States entered in the course of a history which looked pretty much different than the one in England. The most outstanding change was the rise of mass tort litigation which is one of the worst context in which United States came across a dramatic increase in the incidence and size of punitive damages awards especially against big corporations. And the peculiarity of mass torts lawsuits is that the defendant stand accused of committing an act or engaging in a course of conduct that harmed a large number of people and in this context punitive damages began to be awarded by juries in an amount sufficient to punish the defendant not only for the harm done to the plaintiff but also according to the so called total-harm pattern. According to this latter criteria the amount of punitive damages is calculated taking into account the defendant's wrongful and reprehensible out-of state conduct and nationwide commercial policy. So the major problem in mass tort was that of the excessiveness of punitive awards since they became huge and unprecedented in their amounts. Much of the criticism is concerned with the jury which is endowed with a great discretionary power over punitive awards with neither mandatory guidelines nor precise criteria to follow. Among the variety of the case law concerning mass torts there are three major cases showing the problem with juries assessing excessive punitive damages awards: MER/ 29 (1867), McDonald's case (1995) and Boeken v. Philip Morris (2001). Since punitive damages became highly problematic on the ground that they were unprecedented in their amounts, there was the need of a compelling a strong solution and that's why the US Supreme Court for the first time entered in the world of punitive damages and focused on their excessiveness under the due process clause of the XIV Amendment to the American Constitution. The due process clause states that “nor shall any state deprive a person of the life, liberty, or property, without due process of law”. So a due process challenge is based on the concern that big punitive awards deprive defendants of their most fundamental rights without due process of law thereby excessive punitive damages are unconstitutional. The U. S. Supreme Court's movement towards constitutional limits on punitive damages under the due process clause of the XIV Amendment began with great cautiousness over the course of 8 major cases from roughly 1990 to 2008. The first 4 cases were Browning Ferries v. Kelco a Vermont case of 1990, Pacific Mutual Life Ins. v. Haslip an Alabama case of 1991, Txo Production Corporation v. Alliance a West Virginia case of 1993 and Honda v. Oberg an Oregon case of 1994. In these cases constitutional issues have been suggested but not directly tackled since the US Supreme Court refused to draw bright line rules of constitutionality of punitive damages. It was only in 1996 BMW of North America v. Gore, an Alabama case, that the US Supreme Court finally takes the opportunity to strengthen the idea of the Due Process Clause as a constitutional limit for punitive damages. Indeed, the US Supreme Court for the first time struck down a punitive damages award by the Alabama jury as unconstitutional and stressed down the three famous guideposts for imposing punitive damages. Then, in 2003 The US Supreme Court had another opportunity to strike down what it deemed to be a grossly excessive punitive damages award in State Farm v. Campbell a Utah case in which the Gore factors have been reaffirmed and reinforced with the single digit-ratio rule. This latter rule became the most important standard for the due process challenge, according to which punitive damages may not exceed the ratio rule of 9 : 1 otherwise they are unconstitutional. In 2007 again in Philip Morris v. Williams, the US Supreme Court stressed a new individualized nature of punitive damages and established that the amount of punitive damages must be tailored and calibrated to the harm suffered by the plaintiff and juries cannot any more use the total harm pattern. In 2008 in Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, a federal maritime case, the U. S. Supreme Court further tightened punitive damages and venture to 1 : 1 ratio limit between punitive and compensatory damages. Taken together, the Supreme Court's recent punitive damages opinions reflect a clear desire by the Court itself to reduce arbitrariness and excessiveness in punitive damages awards trough a more compelling tool by introducing a constitutional scrutiny and mathematical rules on punitive damages. Face to this new constitutional framework on punitive damages the approach and the reaction of the states in the aftermath of the constitutional limits for excessive punitive damages has not been the same. United States are split in two: the Northern States usually have a restrictive approach to punitive damages and thus they have followed the US Supreme Court's constitutional rules putting ceiling punitive damages. More specifically the states' reforms included abolition of punitive damages for Nebraska and New Hampshire, an assessment of punitive damages only if provided by statutes for Louisiana, Massachusetts and Washington. The reforms included also caps on punitives such as a ratio limit, a dollar cap amount, the split-recovery system or enhancement of the existing procedural mechanisms strengthening the role of trial courts in deciding the amount of punitive damages rather than jurors. Differently the Southern States have always been unwilling to follow the constitutional guidelines; indeed even though also these states have adopted ceiling on punitive damages big awards remained pretty much common. There are far too many cases where the US Supreme Court’s constitutional limits have been disregarded or flouted and this happened throughout the several exceptions which the states introduced especially in particular areas of law where important values are at stake. So what can be noticed is that there are two opposing forces: on one hand there the US Supreme Court is pushing for tighter limits throughout the constitutional-ratio test, on the other hand the states are struggling with evaluating excessive punitive damages awards through the constitutional lens. The current clash between the U. S. Supreme Court and the states looks like a paradox since, as a general rule, states must follow the Supreme Court in its holding at least as a constitutional authority and they should comply with the limits on punitive damages. It is part of the scope of this work to go to the origins of that paradox which makes the Supreme's constitutional limits to be waived by the states. Maybe, the problems come from two main points of inconsistency inherent to the U. S. Supreme Court's intervention on punitive damages: first, the doubtful legitimacy of the Supreme Court's interpretation of the XIV Amendment; indeed the US Supreme Court, by establishing the due process as a limit for punitive damages, has created a new federal constitutional right to have reasonable punitive awards. This is a right which the due process, in its historical meaning, was never meant to comprehend. Secondly, the possible violation of the principle of federalism. The Supreme substantive due process limits on punitives seem to be a federal judicial interference into a matter falling within the states' legislative and judicial authority. Indeed, punitive damages are a state law subject and the states have always had a great discretionary power in ruling them; so the Supreme Court's interpretation of the due process in the context of punitive damages seems to be an illegitimate judicial activism, a break-in an area that both the Constitution and the tradition leave to the states. So, the approach of United States, if compared to the situation of punitive damages in England is pretty much different; what is worth to notice is that in England there is a restrictive approach since exceptions to the limits on punitives are not so frequent. While in United States it is true that the efforts of the U. S Supreme Court to limit punitive awards lead to reinforce their constitutional legitimacy as a black-letter rule of American tort law, making them more predictable and better supervised; however there is still a constant clash with the states. Anyhow, these efforts should be appreciated and should be considered remarkable in European countries in order to the enforce U. S punitive damages decisions. The general perception at European level is that the chances of getting a European court to recognize and enforce a punitive damages decision are almost nil. This trend seems to be confirmed by the practice of some European civil law courts like Italy with the famous case Parrot v. Fimez in 2001. In Italy the violation of the ordre public by a punitive award is grounded both on some provisions of the Italian Civil Code and the Constitution. Primarily, punitive damages are in contrast with art. 2043 c. c which is the core of the civil liability system and with unjust enrichment prohibition of art 2041 c. c. according to which the victim of a wrong is not allowed to recover more than the harm suffered because the wrong cannot be a source of enrichment. Among the Constitutional provisions, punitive damages are deemed to be in contrast with art. 3 Cost. establishing for the principles of equality, reasonableness and proportionality. A doctrinal orientation states that the compensatory rule has its roots just in this constitutional provision and as a consequence it turns out to be a principle with enjoys constitutional protection. So, according to these constitutional roots, the compensation principle strengthens its role of ordre public principle. Further constitutional limits stems form art. 23 (riserva di legge) which provides that every kind of personal or pecuniary performance must be established by the legislator only; then art. 25 comma 2 (principio di legalità) according to which there is no legislative provision which explicitly allows the judge to assess punitive damages. Therefore, damages need to be certain and such a certainty is granted by the compensation dogma. In Germany, the German Supreme Court has addressed the question of the recognition of a California punitive damages decision in 1992 and the exequatur was denied on the ground of the compensatory dogma. In France, a punitive award is in breach of the traditional compensation rule as a matter of principle. This is confirmed by a 2009 decision of the Cour d'Appel de Poitier which denied the exequatur of a California decision containing punitive damages. What is noteworthy is that the grounds on which a civil law court may dismiss the petition is the order public which encompasses all the fundamental principles of a legal system and the compensatory dogma too has been included as fundamental one. However, the outlined pan-compensatory framework could be highly debatable since some civil law countries have some code provisions which raise up new challenges for their tort law systems going towards an unexpected cross-bordering. Indeed, as far as the Italian legal system is concerned, attention should be drawn to some code provisions which could lead to a different perspective over the aims of Italian tort law. Those provisions seem to be endowed with a kind of punitive or sanctioning aim which, unlikely is definitely disregarded by the courts while applying them. The issue at stake is currently addressed with particular focus on a provision contained in a special law: article 12 of Law of Press n. 47 / 1948. Article 12 provides for <b>pecuniary</b> <b>reparation</b> which can be assessed in case of defamation only upon request of the plaintiff and beyond both pecuniary and non pecuniary damages. This is a kind of private penalty which is not linked to the crime committed but it reinforces the civil damages. The punitive element is evident while looking at the criteria used by the judge in assessing this civil penalty: the gravity of the wrongdoer's conduct and the widespread of the defamatory statement. Both criteria give legitimacy to damages which can be far higher than the real harm suffered. Moreover, what is noteworthy is that in reading the very isolated decisions, different headings of damages are stressed down but the real sanctioning aim never comes out. It seems that the decision-maker prefers not to mention any further purposes but the compensatory one. The reluctance of the courts in explaining the real purpose of article 12 justifies the scant application of this provision. The administrative sanction is another tool which seems to be endowed with a punitive aim. There is a great debate over the nature of the administrative sanction and two different approaches can be distinguished. A first approach considers the administrative sanction as a compensatory tool since it mainly aims at restoring the particular interest of the Public Administration. Another approach considers the administrative sanction a penalty which aims at protecting the general interest. Anyhow, these two approaches are not in contrast with each other because it has been invoked the mixed nature of the administrative sanction, both compensatory and punitive. The punitive purpose stems form the need to punish the person who violated the imperative provision of law, while the compensatory purpose is only indirectly accomplished and it comes from the need to compensate the particular interest of the Public Administration. So a significant room is left for punishment. Moreover, as far as the criteria for the awarding are concerned, most part of them are focused on the wrongdoer, such as the inquiry upon its personality and its economic situation. A particular field which testifies this mixed nature is the Environmental law (T. U. A.). The general rule in T. U. A. is article 313 which provides for a reparatory function of the wrong according to the status quo ante doctrine; however, article 341 co. 3, which applies when the wrong is both administrative or criminal, provides for a debatable rule: in cases in which the amount of compensatory damages is not easy to be determined, the damage itself is assumed to be three times the sum established for the administrative sanction. That seems to be a precise legislative choice which places the environmental wrong half-way between a compensatory aim and a punitive one. According to this approach there is not link to the real environmental wrong suffered and the damages go beyond compensation for the actual harm. Besides, article 314 is scarcely applied, courts seems again to show reluctance to use such a tool which could introduce a different aim into the civil liability context. Among the hypothesis which are useful for the present inquiry over a punitive aim of tort law, article 96 of the Italian procedural Code is another important example showing the presence of a kind of punitive/sanctioning aim of the civil liability system. The vexatious litigation of article 96 involves the party who brings a civil action acting in bad faith or gross negligence with the intent to delay the civil proceeding knowing that his/her claim will fail. This party can be ordered to pay damages ex comma 1 and equitative damages ex comma 3. The attempts to consider art. 96 co 1 c. p. c as punitive clash with the traditional academic perspective focusing on the compensation dogma. That's why art. 96 c. p. c has been considered as a special hypothesis of tort damage but always with the traditional civil liability rules. Nowadays, the main doctrinal and courts trend follows the idea that art 96 is within the compensatory aim which permeate our law tradition because of the need to av...|$|E

Given that women represent a very {{large proportion of the}} victims of these conflicts and authoritarianism, and that women arguably experience conflicts in a distinct manner, it makes sense to examine whether reparations programs can be designed to redress women more fairly and efficiently and seek to subvert gender hierarchies that often antecede the conflict.
