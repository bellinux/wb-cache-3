Radish is a worldwide root vegetable crop with significant health and nutritional benefits.

In this study, Pb stress was induced using Pb(NO 3) 2 in hydroponic culture, aiming to characterize the transport, ultrastructural localization and distribution of chemical forms of Pb in different tissues of radish. The results showed that the majority of Pb (85. 76 – 98. 72 %) was retained in underground organs including lateral roots, root heads and taproot skins, while a small proportion of Pb was absorbed by root flesh (0. 44 – 1. 56 %) or transported to the shoot (1. 28 - 14. 24 %). A large proportion of Pb (74. 11 – 99. 30 %) was integrated with undissolved Pb oxalate, protein and <b>pectates</b> forming Pb-phosphate complexes. Moreover, a low-Pb-accumulating line of radish showed a higher proportion of Pb in water-soluble form compared with a high-Pb-accumulating line. Subcellular distribution analysis showed that a large proportion of Pb was bound to cell wall fraction in lateral roots (71. 08 – 80. 40 %) and taproot skin (46. 22 – 77. 94 %), while the leaves and roots had 28. 36 – 39. 37 % and 27. 35 – 46. 51 % of Pb stored in the soluble fraction, respectively.

To further understand the mechanisms involved in Zn adaptability and detoxification, two genotypes Suzhouqing and Aijiaohuang were selected to investigate the chemical forms of Zn and root exudation. Zinc stress obvious strained the plant growth, and Aijiaohuang was more injured than Suhouqing under Zn stress. Under normal Zn levels, the chemical forms of Zn were diverse in three organs between genotypes.

40|$|Our {{previous}} work (E. Shedletzky, M. Shmuel, D. P. Delmer, D. T. A. Lamport [1990] Plant Physiol 94 : 980 - 987) showed that suspension-cultured tomato cells adapted to growth on the cellulose synthesis inhibitor 2, 6 -dichlorobenzonitrile (DCB) have a markedly altered cell wall composition, most notably a markedly reduced {{level of the}} cellulose-xyloglucan network. This study compares the adaptation to DCB of two cell lines from dicots (tomato [Lycopersicon esculentum] and tobacco [Nicotiana tabacum]) and a Graminaceous monocot (barley [Hordeum bulbosum] endosperm). The difference in wall structures between the dicots and the monocot {{is reflected in the}} very different types of wall modifications induced by growth on DCB. The dicots, having reduced levels of cellulose and xyloglucan, possess walls the major integrity of which is provided by Ca 2 +-bridged <b>pectates</b> because protoplasts can be prepared from these cells simply by treatment with divalent cation chelator and a purified endopolygalacturonase. The tensile strength of these walls is considerably less than walls from nonadapted cells, but wall porosity is not altered. In contrast, walls from adapted barley cells contain very little pectic material and normal to elevated levels of noncellulosic polysaccharides compared with walls from nonadapted cells. Surprisingly, they have tensile strengths higher than their nonadapted counterpart, although cellulose levels are reduced by 70 %. Evidence is presented that these walls obtain their additional strength by an altered pattern of cross-linking of polymers involving phenolic components. Such cross-linking may also explain the observation that the porosity of these walls is also considerably reduced. Cells of adapted lines of both the dicots and barley are resistant to plasmolysis, suggesting that they possess very strong connections between the wall and the plasma membrane...|$|R

Tolerance indices were established for tolerant and non-tolerant ecotypes. Copper was found accumulated mainly in the root. Anatomical, histochemical and electron microscopical studies indicated that the major accumulating area within the tolerant plant was the hypodermis. Phloem, endodermis, medullary sheath and tannin bearing cells also showed high concentrations. Chemical extraction schemes were carried out on root material. 29. 0 % Of the metal was removed with low molecular weight water soluble materials, 11. 8 % was solubilized by the proteolytic enzyme pronase and 49. 0 % was associated with pec tic and similar polysaccharidic material. Differential ultracentrifugation indicated that copper was mainly linked to cell wall material. Dialysis with tartaric acid resulted in the removal of 44. 8 % of the copper present in root material, suggesting only weak bonding to cell wall <b>pectates.</b> Water extractable copper from roots was {{in the form of}} bis-prolinato copper(Il).

40|$|The bulk protein {{of green}} leaves {{has been shown}} to be {{dissociable}} and probably distinct from the acid phosphatase previously associated with it. This conclusion is based on the differential sedimentation rates in the analytical ultracentrifuge of the bulk protein and of phosphatase, on the relative amount of enzyme present in the bulk protein prepared by salt-precipitation or by differential centrifugation, and on the comparative stability of the two proteins toward heat and acid. Leaf phosphatase is further shown to be a mixture of isodynamic enzymes with different pH optima and Michaelis constants. A separation was accomplished by adsorption, dialysis, and by antigen-antibody reactions. The phosphatases are shown to lose enzymatic activity during dialysis, but to be capable of reactivation by certain metal ions. Copper ions are the most effective activators. Comparison of the spectrographic analysis of the ash of dialyzed phosphatase with enzymatic activity, however, disclosed a direct relation between activity and the amount of iron and manganese, as well as copper. Various comparative aspects of the enzymes were also studied. The influence of auxin on metabolic pathways is studied by a new method, in which the rate of incorporation of isotopically labeled intermediates into varied components of living tissue is studied as a function of the auxin supplied. It is found that auxin is without effect on the total protein amino nitrogen, or on the rate of incorporation of the C[superscript 14] label from glycine or leucine into tissue proteins of Avena and corn coleoptiles. Hence, auxin has no effect on protein metabolism during cell elongation. Similarly, auxin exerted only small effects on the rate of incorporation of C[superscript 14] from acetate into the lipid constituents of Avena coleoptiles. Added auxin induced no important changes in the incorporation of the C[superscript 14] of acetate or sucrose into the cell wall components of Avena. It was shown, however, that absence of auxin favors incorporation of the isotopic label of acetate or sucrose into the <b>pectates</b> and soluble polyuronide hemicelluloses, while the presence of auxin favors incorporation into the non-cellulosic polysaccharides. These effects are of small magnitude in relation to gross increase in cell length...|$|R

The ICP method was satisfactory only at relatively high concentrations. The biological effects of platinum group metals on Eichhornia crassipes were studied. At an applied metal concentration of 10 ppm, the relative toxicity was found to be: Pt 2 + ≈ Pd 2 + > Os 4 + ≈ Ru 3 + > Ir 3 + > Pt 4 + " Rh 3 +. The metals were deposited mostly in plant roots though varying amounts were transported to the tops. Toxic symptoms of Pt 2 + complexes included the appearance of reddish-brown streaks in the leaves, whilst Rh 3 + appeared to exhibit a tonic effect. In contrast, the grass Setaria verticillata was growth stimulated by Pt 2 + at low levels. Two complexed forms of platinum were investigated further because of the difference in relative toxicity. Platinum applied as the anti-tumour complex cis [Pt(NH 3) 2 Cl 2] was found to be toxic at high levels. When applied at low levels some 47. 9 % of the platinum in the leaves was associated with alpha-cellulose and lignin; 16. 1 % was removed by the proteolytic enzyme pronase, and 20. 8 % found with water soluble <b>pectates.</b> A similar distribution was found in the floats of Eichhornia crassipes and in the plant roots the values were 35 %, 3 - 5 % and 14. 2 % respectively.

40|$|Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} grain legume in sub- Saharan Africa. It is an important source of affordable dietary proteins for the low-income populations. Cowpeas develop hard-to-cook (HTC) defect during storage at high temperaturehigh humidity (HTHH) conditions experienced in these regions. Cowpeas with HTC defect are characterised by long cooking time that lead to increased energy demands that add constraints on the consumers with limited resources. The main objective of this work was to determine the effect of micronisation and hot-air roasting as strategies in the control of HTC defect development. A preliminary study determined the effect of accelerated storage conditions of 40 °C and 80 % relative humidity for 40 days on HTC defect development among 3 cowpea types. The accelerated conditions simulate the HTHH storage conditions. The 3 cowpea types (Bechuana white, Agripienk and Mae–e–tsiliwane) stored at these HTHH conditions developed HTC defect as shown by the increased cooking time. The increase in cooking time was not observed in the control cowpeas stored at 4 oC. The increase in cooking time differed among the 3 cowpea types and this indicated varying degree of susceptibility to HTC defect. HTC defect development at the accelerated HTHH conditions was shown to be due to increased phytase activity that resulted in decreased phytate content and decrease in water soluble pectin. This was in agreement with the "phytase-phytate-pectin" theory. The role of lignification was not established during HTHH storage conditions since peroxidase activity and lignin content did not increase. Agripienk which had the highest increase in cooking time was selected for the heat pre-treatment study. Cowpeas of the Agripienk type were pre-conditioned to 25 % moisture before being micronised or hot-air roasted at 150 oC for 5 minutes. Phytase activity was reduced by 70 % and 45 % by micronisation and roasting pre-treatments respectively. After HTHH storage the cooking time increased by > 430 %, 243 % and 92 % for the control, roasted and micronised cowpeas respectively. Micronised cowpeas had the lowest increase in cooking time. Therefore, HTC defect was controlled but not prevented by the heat pre-treatments. Micronised cowpeas which had the lowest phytase activity has higher phytate and water soluble pectin contents when compared to both roasted and control cowpeas. The mechanism of HTC defect control by the heat pre-treatments was attributed to partial phytase inactivation which decreased the rate phytate hydrolysis and liberation of divalent cations available to bind to pectin in the middle lamella. There was higher content of water soluble pectin and lower content of chelator soluble pectin in the heat pre-treated cowpeas than in the control after HTHH storage. Increase in chelator soluble pectin indicated formation of <b>pectates</b> that limit the rate of cell separation during cooking. Based on these findings, cell separation during cooking was investigated further. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that there was more cell separation in the heat pre-treated cowpeas when compared to the control after HTHH storage. The control cowpeas showed minimal cell separation even after 2 hours of cooking. The ease in cell separation in the heat pre-treated cowpeas was due to presence of more soluble pectin in the middle lamella when compared to the control that had more chelator soluble pectin. Micronised cowpeas had more cell separation when compared to the hot-air roasted cowpeas. Differential scanning calorimetry of cowpea flours showed that HTHH did not lead to an increase in gelatinisation temperatures (To and Tp) or gelatinisation enthalpy(H) in control, micronised and hot-air roasted cowpeas. Increase in these thermal properties is suggested to lead in increased cooking time. The pasting viscosities of the cowpea flours decreased after heat pretreatments but HTHH conditions did not alter the viscosities of either the control or heat pretreated cowpeas. Therefore the changes in starch thermal and pasting properties due to HTHH storage were not observed. This study indicates that HTC defect development was dependent on phytase activity during HTHH storage. The effectiveness of micronisation and hot-air roasting in preventing HTC defect was dependent on the degree of phytase inactivation. Micronisation was more effective than hot air roasting in controlling the development of HTC defect due to a higher degree of phytase inactivation. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.
