On 4 May 2004, the MAS started issuing <b>polymer</b> versions of the S$10 note for general circulation; <b>polymer</b> versions of the S$2 and S$5 notes were subsequently released. Higher denomination banknotes (S$50, S$100, S$1,000 & S$10,000) are still printed on paper. The paper version of the lower denomination banknotes remain in active circulation alongside the <b>polymer</b> version, though the number of S$2 and S$5 paper notes have dwindled significantly since the introduction of <b>polymer</b> notes.|$|E
5|$|Organolithium {{compounds}} {{are widely}} used {{in the production of}} <b>polymer</b> and fine-chemicals. In the <b>polymer</b> industry, which is the dominant consumer of these reagents, alkyl lithium compounds are catalysts/initiators. in anionic polymerization of unfunctionalized olefins. For the production of fine chemicals, organolithium compounds function as strong bases and as reagents for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. Organolithium compounds are prepared from lithium metal and alkyl halides.|$|E
5000|$|Inorganic <b>polymers</b> are <b>polymers</b> with a {{skeletal}} {{structure that}} does not include carbon atoms in the backbone. <b>Polymers</b> containing inorganic and organic components are sometimes called hybrid <b>polymers,</b> and most so-called inorganic <b>polymers</b> are hybrid <b>polymers.</b> One of the best known examples is polydimethylsiloxane, otherwise known commonly as silicone rubber. Inorganic <b>polymers</b> offer some properties not found in organic materials including low temperature flexibility, electrical conductivity, and nonflammability. [...] Inorganic <b>polymers</b> focus on 1-dimensional <b>polymers,</b> not heavily crosslinked materials such as silicate minerals. Inorganic <b>polymers</b> with tunable or responsive properties are sometimes called smart inorganic <b>polymers.</b> A special class of inorganic <b>polymers</b> are geopolymers, which may be anthropogenic or naturally occurring.|$|R
50|$|Most {{synthetic}} <b>polymers</b> {{are resistant}} to microbial attack because of their physical and chemical properties. However, they can become biodegradable when introducing natural <b>polymers</b> such as starch. Natural <b>polymers</b> introduce ester groups that attach to the backbone of non-biodegradable <b>polymers,</b> making them more susceptible to degradation. Due to biodegradable <b>polymers</b> having limited properties; blending synthetic <b>polymers</b> can bring economic advantages and superior properties.|$|R
50|$|Silyl {{modified}} <b>polymers</b> (SMP, also silane-modified <b>polymers,</b> modified-silane <b>polymers,</b> silane terminated <b>polymers,</b> etc.) are <b>polymers</b> (large, chained molecules) terminating with a silyl group.

25|$|The {{attractive}} forces between <b>polymer</b> chains play {{a large part}} in determining polymer's properties. Because <b>polymer</b> chains are so long, these interchain forces are amplified far beyond the attractions between conventional molecules. Different side groups on the <b>polymer</b> can lend the <b>polymer</b> to ionic bonding or hydrogen bonding between its own chains. These stronger forces typically result in higher tensile strength and higher crystalline melting points.|$|E

30|$|Bio-based <b>polymers</b> are {{materials}} {{which are}} produced from renewable resources. The terms bio-based <b>polymers</b> and biodegradable <b>polymers</b> are used {{extensively in the}} literature, {{but there is a}} key difference between the two types of <b>polymers.</b> Biodegradable <b>polymers</b> are defined as materials whose physical and chemical properties undergo deterioration and completely degrade when exposed to microorganisms, carbon dioxide (aerobic) processes, methane (anaerobic processes), and water (aerobic and anaerobic processes). Bio-based <b>polymers</b> can be biodegradable (e.g., polylactic acid) or nondegradable (e.g., biopolyhethylene). Similarly, while many bio-based <b>polymers</b> are biodegradable (e.g., starch and polyhydroxyalkanoates), not all biodegradable <b>polymers</b> are bio-based (e.g., polycaprolactone).|$|R

Questions of bond strengths are investigated along with the stability of ladder <b>polymers</b> and some fundamental concepts in the synthesis of aromatic and heteroaromatic <b>polymers.</b> The substances considered include aromatic single-strand <b>polymers,</b> heteroaromatic <b>polymers,</b> <b>polymers</b> obtained by addition polymerizations, and nonhydrogen-containing <b>polymers.</b> Future trends are also explored...|$|R
25|$|Two main {{groups of}} <b>polymers</b> exist: {{synthetic}} <b>polymers</b> and biopolymers.

25|$|Plasma {{polymers}} {{also contain}} an internal stress. If {{a thick layer}} (e.g. 1µm) of a plasma <b>polymer</b> is deposited on a glass slide, the plasma <b>polymer</b> will buckle and frequently crack. The curling is attributed to an internal stress formed in the plasma <b>polymer</b> during the <b>polymer</b> deposition. The degree of curling {{is dependent on the}} monomer as well as the conditions of the plasma polymerization.|$|E
25|$|<b>Polymer</b> {{degradation}} is {{a change}} in the properties—tensile strength, color, shape, or molecular weight—of a <b>polymer</b> or polymer-based product under the influence of one or more environmental factors, such as heat, light, chemicals and, in some cases, galvanic action. It is often due to the scission of <b>polymer</b> chain bonds via hydrolysis, leading to a decrease in the molecular mass of the <b>polymer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Step-growth <b>polymers</b> {{are defined}} as <b>polymers</b> formed by the {{stepwise}} reaction between functional groups of monomers, usually containing heteroatoms such as nitrogen or oxygen. Most step-growth <b>polymers</b> are also classified as condensation <b>polymers,</b> but not all step-growth <b>polymers</b> (like polyurethanes formed from isocyanate and alcohol bifunctional monomers) release condensates; in this case, we talk about addition <b>polymers.</b> Step-growth <b>polymers</b> increase in molecular weight at a very slow rate at lower conversions and reach moderately high molecular weights only at very high conversion (i.e., >95%).|$|R

Conductive <b>polymers</b> are generally not thermoplastics, i.e., they are not thermoformable. But, like insulating <b>polymers,</b> they are organic materials. They can offer high electrical conductivity but do not show similar mechanical properties to other commercially available <b>polymers.</b> The electrical properties can be fine-tuned using the methods of organic synthesis and by advanced dispersion techniques.|$|R

This chapter {{discusses the}} synthesis, properties, and applications of different hydrophilic <b>polymers.</b> It considers the hydrophilic <b>polymers</b> as three {{categories such as}} natural, semisynthetic, and synthetic. Natural hydrophilic <b>polymers</b> are again classified into plant origin and animal origin. Semisynthetic water-soluble <b>polymers</b> are derived by either chemical modification of natural <b>polymers</b> or from microbial sources. Most natural hydrophilic <b>polymers</b> are polysaccharides, which vary substantially in their basic sugar units, linkages, and substituents. Synthetic hydrophilic <b>polymers</b> have different applications in pharmacology, biotechnology, and chemistry. The chapter provides some examples of synthetic hydrophilic <b>polymers.</b> The copolymer Divinyl Ether-Maleic Anhydride (DIVEMA), which {{is also known as}} pyran copolymer, is used in drug delivery systems.

25|$|Additionally, the {{molecular}} {{weight of the}} <b>polymer</b> of interest is known to affect its creep behavior. The effect of increasing molecular weight tends to promote secondary bonding between <b>polymer</b> chains and thus make the <b>polymer</b> more creep resistant. Similarly, aromatic polymers are even more creep resistant due to the added stiffness from the rings. Both molecular weight and aromatic rings add to polymers' thermal stability, increasing the creep resistance of a <b>polymer.</b>|$|E

25|$|However, solid <b>polymer</b> {{electrolytic}} capacitors, aluminum {{as well as}} tantalum and niobium {{electrolytic capacitors}} also have a lifetime specification. The <b>polymer</b> electrolyte has a small deterioration of conductivity caused by a thermal degradation mechanism in the conductive <b>polymer.</b> The electrical conductivity decreases {{as a function of}} time, in agreement with a granular metal type structure, in which aging is due to the shrinking of the conductive <b>polymer</b> grains. The lifetime of <b>polymer</b> electrolytic capacitors is specified in terms similar to non-solid e-caps but its lifetime calculation follows other rules, leading to much longer operational lifetimes.|$|E
50|$|Most {{intrinsically}} fire-resistant <b>polymers</b> {{are made}} by incorporation of aromatic cycles or heterocycles, which lend rigidity and stability to the <b>polymers.</b> Polyimides, polybenzoxazoles (PBOs), polybenzimidazoles, and polybenzthiazoles (PBTs) are examples of <b>polymers</b> made with aromatic heterocycles (Figure 2). <b>Polymers</b> made with aromatic monomers {{have a tendency to}} condense into chars upon combustion, decreasing the amount of flammable gas that is released.

Synthesis of <b>polymers,</b> such as polyesters, with fire retardant monomers were also developed around this time. Incorporating flame-resistant additives into <b>polymers</b> became a common and relatively cheap way to reduce the flammability of <b>polymers,</b> while synthesizing intrinsically fire-resistant <b>polymers</b> has remained a more expensive alternative, although the properties of these <b>polymers</b> are usually more efficient at deterring combustion.|$|R
