40|$|Background: The {{most common}} {{complication}} of lumbar <b>puncture</b> (LP) occurring in over {{thirty percent of}} patients is headache. The position after lumbar <b>puncture,</b> needle type and size, and volume of the extracted cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been evaluated as contributory factors in occurrence of post lumbar <b>puncture</b> headache (PLPH), but the position before lumbar <b>puncture</b> has not been evaluated. Methods: The occurrence of post lumbar <b>puncture</b> headache was evaluated in 125 patients undergoing lumbar <b>puncture,</b> divided randomly into sitting and lateral decubitus groups in the following five days. Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Thirty eight patients (30. 4 %) reported headache after lumbar <b>puncture</b> in the two groups, and post lumbar <b>puncture</b> headache was significantly lower in the lateral decubitus position (p = 0. 001).

5|$|One Velociratoptor mongoliensis skull bears two {{parallel}} rows of small <b>punctures</b> that match the spacing {{and size of}} Velociraptor teeth. Scientists believe that the wound was likely inflicted by another Velociraptor during a fight.

Another specimen, found with the bones of an azhdarchid pterosaur within its stomach cavity, was carrying or recovering from an injury sustained to its ribs. From evidence on the pterosaur bones, which were devoid of pitting or deformations from digestion, the Velociraptor died shortly after, possibly from the earlier injury.|$|E

40|$|In this {{experimental}} study, {{we measured}} the force needed to <b>puncture</b> the liver (low elastin) and the spleen (high elastin). The surface displacement preceding <b>puncture</b> was also measured. These data {{are relevant to}} an understanding of surgical technique and are essential to the development of electronic surgical simulators. Controlled <b>puncture</b> experiments were performed on intact organs harvested from pigs and sheep, as well as on their surface capsules following removal and suspension at zero strain and at three increasing levels of prestrain. The biomechanical data were compared with information obtained from histological studies. The spleen has a higher <b>puncture</b> force than the liver and suffers greater displacement before <b>puncture</b> (p < 0. 05). Prestrain decreases displacement before <b>puncture</b> (p < 0. 05) but has no effect on <b>puncture</b> force. The higher <b>puncture</b> force and displacement of spleen, as compared with liver, is probably due to its higher elastin content...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: A precise <b>puncture</b> of the renal {{collecting}} {{system is the}} most essential step for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). There are many techniques describing this crucial first step in PCNL including the bull's eye technique, triangulation technique, free-hand technique, and gradual descensus technique. We describe a novel <b>puncture</b> guide to assist accurate percutaneous needle placement during bull's eye technique. Methods: The mini access guide (MAG) stabilizes the initial <b>puncture</b> needle by mounting it on an adjustable multidirectional carrier fixed to the patient's skin, which aids in achieving the “bull's eye” <b>puncture.</b> It also avoids a direct fluoroscopic exposure of the urologist's hand during the <b>puncture.</b> Sixty consecutive patients with solitary renal calculus were randomized to traditional hand versus MAG <b>puncture</b> during bull's eye technique of <b>puncture</b> and the fluoroscopy time was assessed. Results: The median fluoroscopy screening time for traditional free-hand bull's eye and MAG-guided bull's eye <b>puncture</b> (fluoroscopic screening time for <b>puncture)</b> was 55 versus 21 s (P = 0. 001) and the median time to <b>puncture</b> was 80 versus 55 s (P = 0. 052), respectively. Novice residents also learned <b>puncture</b> technique faster with MAG on simulator. Conclusion: The MAG is a simple, portable, cheap, and novel assistant to achieve successful PCNL <b>puncture.</b> It would be of great help for novices to establish access during their learning phase of PCNL. It would also be an asset toward significantly decreasing the radiation dose during PCNL access...|$|R

In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow <b>punctures</b> and could not cut or slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E

40|$|AbstractResistance to <b>puncture</b> is a {{critical}} property for several applications, in particular for elastomer materials used in protective clothing. To evaluate the <b>puncture</b> resistance of membranes, some methods have been proposed as standard tests. However, the rounded <b>puncture</b> probes used in these tests {{are very different from}} real pointed objects like medical needles, and may not measure the level of material resistance that correspond to them. In fact, <b>puncture</b> by medical needles is shown to proceed gradually as the needle cuts into the membrane. This behavior is highly different from <b>puncture</b> by rounded probes which occurs suddenly when the strain at the probe tip reaches the failure value. In addition, maximum force values are observed to be much smaller with medical needles. A method has been developed based on the change in strain energy with the <b>puncture</b> depth to evaluate the fracture energy associated to <b>puncture.</b> The results show that the phenomenon of <b>puncture</b> by medical needles involves contributions both from friction and fracture energy, in a similar way as for cutting. Prestrained samples must be used to determine the material <b>puncture</b> energy...|$|R

It was found that craters could not be repaired simply by filling the holes with rubble. This would quickly fill with water, settle, and become a bog hole. A proper repair required that the water be pumped out, and the crater filled with stone, {{which had to be}} compacted, rolled and re-surfaced. In addition to the craters, bombing sprayed fragments over the runways that could cause <b>punctures</b> and blowouts in airplane tyres, resulting in accidents on takeoff and landing. A visual search for fragments had to be made after each bombing raid.|$|E

5|$|Particularly {{prominent}} in the ocean waters surrounding Hilton Head Island, the stingray serves as a fascination and painful natural encounter for many beach goers. Small stingrays inhabit the quieter, shallow region of ocean floor just beyond the break of the surf, typically buried beneath {{a thin layer of}} sand. Stingrays are a type of demersal, cartilaginous fish common to the South Carolina coast as well as other areas on the Atlantic shoreline. Typically, stingrays avoid contact with humans unless they are accidentally stepped upon, a situation often ending in a stingray injury, where the stingray <b>punctures</b> the human with its poisonous barb. While these injuries are extremely painful, they are not usually life-threatening {{as long as they are}} properly attended to by a medical professional. One complaint shared by many Hilton Head Island tourists is that the lifeguards maintain a poor alert system for notifying swimmers when numerous stingrays have been sighted within a specific stretch of the shore. This lack of notification on days when multiple sightings are reported can sometimes end in a high number of stingray injuries that might have otherwise been avoided; in 2009, 121 people were treated for stingray injuries.|$|E

40|$|<b>Puncture</b> injury {{leads to}} large {{qualitative}} and quantitative losses of loose tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) when they pass through handling operations. Some cultivars are less susceptible to <b>puncture</b> injury, which is a desirable characteristic for tomato quality. It is, therefore, important that the <b>puncture</b> injury susceptibility of a new tomato cultivar is known, prior to commercialisation and large-scale production. In this research, a pendulum was designed to evaluate the <b>puncture</b> injury susceptibility of tomato cultivars in an objective way. Logistic regression {{was used as a}} statistical tool to model the influence of the impact energy on the incidence of <b>puncture</b> injury. This methodology was applied to two cultivars with different susceptibilities to <b>puncture</b> injury, 'Tradiro' (less susceptible) and 'Blitz' (very susceptible). Their susceptibilities to <b>puncture</b> injury were measured as a function of storage time and colour stage. It was found that: (i) tomatoes at harvest were less susceptible to <b>puncture</b> injury than after storage for several days; and (ii) colour at harvest had no effect on the susceptibility for <b>puncture</b> injury. This research revealed that the pendulum test in combination with logistic regression is a suitable method and a promising measurement tool to determine the <b>puncture</b> injury susceptibility of tomato cultivars.
