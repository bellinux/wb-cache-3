40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In digital pathology, devising {{effective}} image representations {{is crucial to}} design robust automated diagnosis systems. To this end, many studies have proposed to develop object-based representations, instead of directly using image pixels, since a histopathological image may contain {{a considerable amount of}} noise typically at the pixel-level. These <b>previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>define</b> their objects, based on the color information, as to approximately represent histological tissue components in an image and then use the spatial distribution of these objects for image representation and classification. Thus, object definition has a direct effect on the way of representing the image, which in turn affects classification accuracies. In this thesis, we present a new model for effective representation and classification of histopathological images. The contributions of this model are twofold. First, it introduces a new two-tier tissue decomposition method for defining a set of multityped objects in an image. Different than the <b>previous</b> <b>studies,</b> these objects are defined combining the texture, shape, and size information and they may correspond to individual histological components as well as tissue sub-regions of different characteristics. As its second contribution, it defines a new metric, which we call “dominant blob scale”, to characterize the shape and size of an object with a single scalar value. Our experiments on colon tissue images reveal that this new object definition and characterization provides distinguishing representation of normal and cancerous histopathological images, which is effective to obtain more accurate classification results compared to its counterparts.

In this paper we propose Multiple-Objective Metric (MOM), which reflects four different metrics for base station placement in wireless sensor networks. First, the ratio of sensor nodes which can communicate with a base station via either single-hop or multi-hop represents the coverage of sensor nodes. Second, the average ratio of sensor nodes after the failure of base stations represents the fault tolerance of a network. Third, the average distance between sensor nodes and their nearest base station represents the energy consumption of a network. Fourth, the standard deviation {{of the degree of}} base stations represents the average delay of a network due to congestion. We show that placing multiple base stations using our proposed MOM can fairly increase various properties of wireless sensor networks...|$|R

On the other hand, as there is no data on the clinical state of the interviewed children, one cannot know whether this depressive coping mechanism is purely a result of the parent's conditions or whether it is somewhat contaminated by the children's own clinical course.

Additionally, perspective studies of cyanobacteria recruitment in lakes were pointed out. In light of the existing knowledge, cyanobacteria recruitment could be regarded as a process that benthic overwintering cyanobacteria migrated to the pelagic phase after germination and growth renewal under suitable conditions. This process was divided into three consecutive phases: germination, a potential growth phase and migration to the pelagic phase. <b>Previous</b> <b>studies</b> <b>mostly</b> focused on the migration from sediments to water. To date, several kinds of traps had been designed to investigate cyanobacteria recruitment.

Significant classification performance was achieved in all 4 modalities. Modality-independent decoding was implemented by training and testing the searchlight method across modalities. This allowed the localization of those brain regions, which correctly discriminated between the categories, independent of stimulus modality. The analysis revealed large clusters of voxels in the left inferior temporal cortex and in frontal regions. These voxels also allowed category discrimination in a free recall session where subjects recalled the objects in the absence of external stimuli.

In contrast, less is known about how the geometric cues mediate the migration dynamics of cells. Here, we fabricate graphene oxide (GO) microstripes on cell non-adhesive PEG substrate by using micromolding in capillary (MIMIC) method. Such micropatterns with alternating cell adhesion and cell resistance enable an effective control of selective adhesion and migration of single cells. The sharp contrast in cell adhesion minimizes the invasion of cells into the PEG patterns, and thereby strongly confines the cells on GO microstripes. As a result, the cells are forced to adapt highly polarized, elongated, and oriented geometry to fit the patterns. A series of pattern widths have been fabricated to modulate the extent of cell deformation and polarization. Under strong confinement, the cytoskeleton contractility, intracellular traction, and actin filament elongation are highly promoted, which result in enhanced cell migration along the patterns. This work provides an important insight into developing combinatorial graphene-based patterns for the control of cell migration dynamics, which is of great significance for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine...|$|R
