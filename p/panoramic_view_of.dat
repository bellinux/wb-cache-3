5|$|The Helix has {{traditionally}} been known for offering a <b>panoramic</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the New York skyline. While local zoning laws prohibit the construction of high-rise buildings that would obstruct sight-lines from higher points in town, as of June 2013 {{construction of a new}} residential building partially blocked the view from the lower portion of the roadway. As of 2015, the Helix is considered by the PANYNJ to have a working life-span of ten years. Alternatives to its replacement include tunnels under the Palisades directly to the Lincoln Tunnel portals.|$|E

5|$|The {{station is}} also {{close to the}} {{original}} entrance gate to Sloatsburg's Cappamore Farm. The house in the nearby mountainside was built around 1900 as an estate for Nicholas T. Brown, a local alderman from Paterson, New Jersey. This estate and farm gave a <b>panoramic</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the countryside around Sloatsburg. The house was demolished during {{the construction of the}} New York State Thruway in 1956. The steel bridge over the Ramapo River and the wooden bridge over Sloat's Millrace were removed as they had become hazardous. Today, all that remains are the stone pillar entranceway, and a walking trail to the nearby Sloat's Dam. The gateposts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with the remaining mill and dam structures since they used the same stonework.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Early Netherlandish painters did not usually {{pay much attention to}} landscape backgrounds. They were often included, showing strong influence from the Italian painters, but typically as minor elements of the composition, seen in the far distance and lacking any real observation of nature. This diptych, however, contains {{one of the most memorable}} landscape backgrounds in Northern 15th-century art. The <b>panoramic</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Jerusalem extends upwards in the distance to the mountainous peaked range in the background. The sky, which continues to the upper part of the right hand panel, is rendered in deep blues and lined with cumulus clouds. These clouds are similar to those in the Ghent Altarpiece and, as in that work, are included to give depth to and enliven the background skyscape. The sky seems to have just darkened, in keeping with the idea that the panel captures the moment of Jesus' death. Faint cirrus clouds can be seen in the far high-ground, with the presence of the sun is suggested by a shadow falling on the top left area of the panel.|$|E
