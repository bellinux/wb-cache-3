On {{the basis of the}} three-dimensional solid model established using PRO / E, we make the simulation for the institutions overall course of the campaign through using ADAMS, to detected design products by experience whether meet the actual requirements or not, but also provide a theoretical basis for the optimized design of wall <b>plastering</b> <b>machine</b> in the future...|$|E
40|$|Semi-automatic wall <b>plastering</b> <b>machine</b> can {{effectively}} reduce the labor intensity of workers, increase operational efficiency {{in the construction}} process. A problem is solved how to select its work parameters. In order to obtain the best working conditions of a certain wall <b>plastering</b> <b>machine,</b> this paper has studied hydrostatic compaction process of the wall <b>plastering</b> <b>machine.</b> According to “Standard of the Architectural Decoration Project Quality Approval” in China, mortar compaction effects in cases of different plastering speed, rotation speed of the screw auger, and mortar consistency have been obtained by experiments. Using static-pressure method for wall plastering, experimental {{results showed that the}} best plastering speed, screw auger rotation speed and mortar consistency is in the range of 17 ~ 18. 2 cm/s, 55 ~ 65 r/min and 78 ~ 86 mm...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{manual process}} of wall {{plastering}} on construction site, {{there is a}} huge scale requirement of labor and hence the labor cost is responsible for increasing the price of construction or project work. The quality of work is mostly depending on the skill of the labor work in manual plastering process. The solution of these problems is just to automate the process, so {{that there will be a}} saving of period and cost and getting good plaster finishing to the walls. The <b>plastering</b> <b>machine</b> can plaster the walls automatically and very smoothly. Due to which the process will fast and there will be saving of cost and time this will helps to reduce the total cost, total time which ultimately responsible for the growth and hence the progress rate of a country is going to increase...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{knowledge}} and the competence of the firm members are substantial success factors in the world-wide competition. For a "Hidden Champion " like the middle-sized manufacturer of Top-Class Concrete Pumps and <b>Plastering</b> <b>Machines,</b> Putzmeister, Inc. /Germany, a systematic and anticipating Competence Development System is essential. The article describes a pilot project started in spring 2002 to gain more specific knowledge about {{the implementation of a}} strategic computer aided, employee orientated Skill Management System in the Company. The main success factors found are first, an acceptance strategy, which includes the participation of motivated groups of pilots, the integration of the workers council, the support of the management as well as much information and transparency about the objectives and the purpose of the system. Especially a good co-operation with the workers council is from great importance. Finally enough personnel and organizational resources must be given to the project...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} was constructed from 1935-1938 {{based on the}} designs of Philadelphia School Board architect Irwin Catharine. The {{main body of the}} school is built of limestone-trimmed yellow brick, with a limestone low-rise section abutting the higher brick section. Piers and pillasters emphasize verticality in the Art Deco design. Carved cartouches show people at work. Classrooms adjoin one of two central light courts. At the time of its construction, the building represented a new trend in vocational education. Rather than just teach carpentry skills, the school taught, and had dedicated space for, subjects such as brick laying, <b>plastering,</b> plumbing, <b>machine</b> building, tailoring, and hairdressing.|$|R
5000|$|Plaster {{spraying}} {{allows a}} plasterer to skim a drywall {{more than five}} times faster than using a hand float to apply it. Although classic gypsum-based plaster can be sprayed if it is [...] "spray grade," [...] most plaster sprayers prefer the organic-based pre-mixed plaster packaged in a plastic bag because the <b>plaster</b> spraying <b>machine</b> {{does not need to be}} cleaned out after the job is finished, providing that plaster is kept moist. The pre-mixed plaster also has the advantage that any surplus can be recycled, almost eliminating waste, and plasterers do not need to haul water and mix the plaster from powder. A drywall skimmed with pre-mixed plaster can be painted in less than 24 hours, depending on the ambient temperature and humidity.|$|R
