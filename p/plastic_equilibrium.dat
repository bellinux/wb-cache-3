50|$|Despite its {{diversity}} and its profusion, his work reveals a profound unity in its writing, which materializes in his preference for diagonal axes, for compositions showing fragile equilibrium {{and in his}} spatiotemporal approach to the visual world. Barbeau thus expresses his fascination for movement as a bearer of desire and of time measure. He also stands out for the symbolic dimension and irony that translate from {{the title of his}} purest abstractions. As a “baroque” artist, his work falls within a fusional approach to artistic creation, while revealing his search for formal perfection and <b>plastic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Economy of means and aesthetic perfection being of great concern for him, Barbeau still needs to express emotions in an elated way and refers to the unconscious, even in his paintings, let them be optical, geometrical, minimalist or serial. Thus, his work reveals itself as a permanent and utopian quest in reaching the synthesis of opposites.|$|E
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1956 Dr. D. H. TrollopeThe design of embankments usually involves a stability analysis {{by one or more}} of the various slip surface methods. A common feature of these methods is the assumption that a state of limiting <b>plastic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> exists over the surface of failure. The shape of the potential failure surface is, however, determined empirically. In recent years various refinements have been introduced in the most generally used method (the Swedish slip-circle); but these refinements have been superficial and the underlying assumptions of the method continue to be accepted, to a greater or lesser degree.

40|$|Many {{interesting}} {{tasks in}} technology need {{the solution of}} complex boundary value problems modeled by the mathematical theory of elasticity and elastoplasticity. Error controlled adaptive strategies {{should be used in}} order to achieve a prescribed accuracy of the computed solutions at minimum cost. In this paper, locally computed residual error indicators in the primal form of the finiteelement -method for Elasticity as well as Hencky- and Prandtl-Reu-plasticity without and with nonlinear hardening are presented, controlling global errors of <b>equilibrium,</b> <b>plastic</b> strain rates, the yield condition and the numerical integration of the flow rule.

40|$|Abstract　In this paper, {{the authors}} {{researched}} the equilibrum {{temperature in the}} teeth of plastic gears which should be taken into consideraration on the design of plastic gears. There are two kinds of heat that can be generated by meshing the of plastic gears : first, the frictional heat, produced by the friction between teeth 2 ̆ 7 s surfaces : and secondly, the heat, derived from the hysteresis loss {{due to the fact that}} plastic material is viscoelastic. Also, regarding the quantity of heat, which is emitted into the atmosphere from the higher-temperature tooth surface of rotating gears, the authors derived a calculation formula based on their experiments, and from these, they were able to obtain another calculation formula of determing the equilibrium temperature {{in the teeth of}} operating <b>plastic</b> gears. The <b>equilibrium</b> temperature in the teeth of test gears were also experimentally measured and these measured values were compared with the calculation values : both showed comparatively good coincidence...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Polymeric {{composites}} exhibit highly nonlinear {{and rate}} dependent behavior during {{loading and unloading}} in off-axis directions. In this study, off-axis specimens were used to study this behavior in AS 4 /PEEK thermoplastic composite. The equilibrium states of stress during loading and unloading were determined by stress–relaxation and stress–recovery tests, respectively. It {{was found that the}} equilibrium stress–strain curves for loading and unloading are basically the same for the same loading–unloading rate. A one-parameter plasticity model was used to generate a master <b>equilibrium</b> <b>plastic</b> stress–strain curve for both loading and unloading. Stress relaxation curves and recovery curves were obtained during loading and unloading cycles, respectively, for various strain rates. Similarity between relaxation and recovery curves was noted, and the effective stress defined from the one-parameter plastic potential function was able to describe both curves.

40|$|Up to a {{very recent}} time, it has been {{difficult}} or impossible to perform exact analyses of any realistic field problem in soil mechanics or soil engineering even when a linearly elastic behavior was assumed for the soil involved. As a consequence, analyses in soil mechanics have been restricted to extremely idealized physical situations including linearly elastic behavior (uniform loads or rigid footings at the surface of semi-infinite elastic continua, for example) or to problems of <b>plastic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> The latter also include greatly simplified geometries and an idealized material behavior.

40|$|The bearing {{capacity}} of strip footings on unsaturated soils is studied using slip line theory. The suction profiles considered are non-uniform with depth and correspond to vertical {{flow of water}} by infiltration or evaporation. The slip line theory assumes a <b>plastic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> state of a Mohr-Coulomb soil in which suction influences are included using the effective stress concept. This paper shows that {{the influence of a}} non-uniform suction profile on {{bearing capacity}} is significant. When the contribution of suction to the effective stress can be approximated as a function that varies linearly with depth, the effects of suction on bearing capacity can be represented in dimensionless form in separate charts for smooth and rough footings. Using the charts the bearing capacity can be determined for any combination of friction angle, footing width, surcharge, soil unit weight and linear profiles of cohesion and the contribution of suction to the effective stress...|$|E
40|$|The {{depth of}} {{cracking}} of soils is often required for boundary value and limit equilibrium analyses in geotechnical engineering. At present, {{the depth of}} cracking is customarily expressed {{as a function of}} shear strength using the Rankine theory of lateral earth pressure. The objectives of this thesis are to study the mechanism of desiccation cracking in soils and to propose a mathematical model for the prediction of crack depth. Observations obtained from the laboratory program indicated that the locations of desiccation cracks and the crack spacing were highly dependent upon the inhomogeneities in the soils. Based on the experimental results, desiccation cracks were initiated at a matric suction of less than 10 kPa for silty and clayey soils. Silty soils are expected to require a higher matric suction at cracking than do clayey soils. The volumetric shrinkage strain at cracking for Indian Head Till was about 7 %. Regina Clay is expected to require a lower volumetric shrinkage strain at cracking than does Indian Head Till. Two mathematical expressions were derived using the volume change (i. e., elastic equilibrium analysis) and shear strength (i. e., <b>plastic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> analysis) behavior of unsaturated soils for the prediction of crack depth. Based on the result of a parametric study, {{it was found that the}} crack depth predicted by the plastic analysis was almost twice as deep as that predicted by the elastic analysis. Since desiccation cracks are formed as a result of soil volume reduction, the elastic analysis is expected to be more appropriate for the prediction of crack depth, although the validity of the analysis must be confirmed with future studies on the desiccation crack depth in the field...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} load {{of a typical}} steel frame {{is dependent on the}} geometrically nonlinear and material yielding effects. The complexity for considering material yielding by the plastic hinge approach is the unknown location of the plastic hinge, which can occur at the ends or any position along the element length. For the latter case, a member is divided into many elements in order to approximate the location of a plastic hinge. This process is tedious, inconvenient to use, and involves extensive computer time. Further, the strength check for sectional capacity using the LRFD code requires an assumption of the K factor or the effective length ratio, which further complicates a computer analysis for the {{ultimate load}} of a steel frame. To describe the formation of a plastic hinge along an element in a member at the ultimate limit state, a single element capable of modeling the P - δ effect as well as the formation of the plastic hinge is needed. This paper adopts a simple concept of superimposition of triangular deflected shapes due to the formation of plastic hinge to the fifth order deflection shape for elastic deflection to yield the final deflection of the element, the <b>plastic</b> pointwise <b>equilibrium</b> polynomial (PPEP) element. Equilibrium of moment and shear at midspan of an element is maintained for accurate modeling of the P - δ effect in the tangent and secant stiffness. The robustness, accuracy and reliability of the developed element are demonstrated in a number of worked examples. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The present {{work has}} {{examined}} the effects of short- (30 [*]min) and long-term (14 [*]h) exposure to cyclosporine A (CsA) on the uptake of L-DOPA, its decarboxylation to dopamine and the cellular extrusion of taken up L-DOPA and of newly-formed amine in monolayers of LLC-PK 1 cells. In the presence of benserazide (50 [*]μM), L-DOPA was rapidly accumulated in LLC-PK 1 cells (cultured in collagen-treated <b>plastic)</b> attaining <b>equilibrium</b> at 30 [*]min of incubation. Non-linear analysis of the saturation curves revealed a Km of 113 ± 16 [*]μM and a Vmax of 5581 ± 297 [*]pmol[*]mg− 1 protein 6 [*]min− 1. In the absence of benserazide, LLC-PK 1 cells incubated with increasing concentrations of L-DOPA (10 to 500 [*]μM) for 6 [*]min accumulate newly-formed dopamine by a saturable process with apparent Km and Vmax values of 31 ± 6 [*]μM and 1793 ± 91 [*]pmol[*]mg− 1 protein 6 [*]min− 1, respectively. The fractional outflow of newly-formed dopamine was found to be 20 %. Up to 200 [*]μM of intracellular newly-formed dopamine, the outward transfer of the amine was found to be a non-saturable process. Short-term exposure to CsA (0. 3, 1. 0 and 3. 0 [*]μg[*]ml− 1) was found not to change the intracellular concentrations of newly-formed dopamine, but increased the levels of dopamine in the incubation medium (143 % to 224 % increase) and the total amount of dopamine formed (31 % to 59 % increase). Long-term exposure to CsA (0. 03 to 3. 0 [*]μg[*]ml− 1) reduced the total amount of dopamine (15 % to 39 % reduction) and the intracellular levels of the amine (11 % to 56 % reduction), without changing dopamine levels in the incubation medium. Both short- and long-term exposure to CsA resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the fractional outflow of newly-formed dopamine. Short-term exposure to CsA (3. 0 [*]μg[*]ml− 1) reduced the apical extrusion of intracellular L-DOPA by 15 % (P< 0. 05), whereas long-term exposure to CsA reverted this effect and decreased its intracellular availability (15 % reduction; P< 0. 05). Detection of P-glycoprotein activity was carried out by measuring verapamil- or UIC 2 -sensitive rhodamine 123 accumulation. Both UIC 2 (3 [*]μg[*]ml− 1) and verapamil (25 [*]μM) significantly increased the accumulation of rhodamine 123 in LLC-PK 1 cells. A 30 [*]min exposure to CsA was found not to affect the accumulation of rhodamine 123 in the presence of verapamil (25 [*]μM), whereas a 14 [*]h exposure to CsA was found to reduce the accumulation of rhodamine 123. In conclusion, the increase and the reduction in the formation of dopamine after short- and long-term exposure to CsA, respectively, correlate with the effects of the immunosuppressant on the apical cell extrusion of taken up L-DOPA, suggesting the involvement of P-glycoprotein. The effects of CsA on the fractional outflow of newly-formed dopamine appear to be mediated by a different mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} an {{investigation}} of general principles of superplasticity (SP) in deformed materials. It is shown that a non-linear, wave plastic deformation is the basic process for all plastic deformation phenomena, it makes an individual contribution into these phenomena, allows describing them from the same standpoints, and offers a way to follow {{the relationship between the}} physics of defects and the mechanics of plasticity. It is to be noted that macro and meso defects - discontinuities in the vector fields of macro and meso elastic displacements, are no less fundamental than are the microdefects - dislocations and disclinations, it is the latter which form the process of localized macrodeformation. General mechanisms of this process are analyzed in this study. Constitutive equation of superplastic state is obtained, which relates the strain rate, its rotational modes, local irreversible stresses, temperature, and density of heat and mass transfer. Special cases and their derived relations are analyzed. It is shown that SP is determined by <b>plastic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> concurrent with the composition and structure fluctuations. An expression is obtained for the superplastic flow velocity, containing three terms: velocity of wave plastic macroprocess, increased by fluctuations, velocity prescribed by the gradient of external sources (diffusion, etc.), and velocity of the delayed intragranular slip. It should be noted that transformation is a characteristic and necessary feature of SP flow. In the absence of transformations, deformation occurs via creep. Fragmentation of the deforming region and grain-boundary sliding (GBS) are discussed and so are their mechanisms and characteristic features. Formulas are derived for the strain rate under conditions of GBS and the reasons for its non-monotonic dependence on grain size, applied stresses and temperature are analyzed.

40|$|The use {{of surface}} {{floating}} dredgers in deep inland reservoirs and continental shelves, either for dredging or mining purposes, is restricted by several operational limitations. Use of smaller surface floating dredgers in deep inland reservoirs is {{constrained by the}} ladder (a long truss like structure 'arm' that supports the excavation tool) length. Bigger dredgers have operational restrictions and mobilization problems. In shelf areas, the dredging operation is less precise due to currents, winds and waves. The floating pipelines, floats and winch wires are obstacles to navigational paths for other surface vessels. High investment costs {{are involved in the}} construction of bigger high capacity dredgers. It is difficult to modify such systems once they are constructed. The limitation of the existing technology served as the main motivation to design an active legged submersible dredger / miner, which is described in this thesis. The designed vehicle is named the 'Golden Tortoise' because it simulates the belly crawling motion of a tortoise or turtle. A full scale prototype vehicle was manufactured by Excavation & Equipment Manufacturing (P) Ltd., (EEM (P) Ltd.) India. The prototype vehicle is suitable for operation in deep inland reservoirs up to a depth of 50 m and is designed to excavate sand, silt or clay mixtures in various proportions. [...] Parametric performance models were developed to evaluate the locomotion, excavation and transportation processes of the designed vehicle. Periodic gait plans were developed for straight line and curvilinear locomotion on natural terrain. Experimental validation of the theoretical gait plans was performed, which showed that the average slip was about 20 % at the foot/soil interface in medium to relatively fine sands. Parametric models were developed for the evaluation of the locomotion cycle time of the designed vehicle. The locomotion cycle time was also measured from the gait plan tests and was found to be an average of 30 seconds. The static load incident at each foot {{as a function of the}} vehicle weight and the leg joint parameters was predicted by developing a two-dimensional model based on simple beam theory. Prototype tests were performed to measure the static load incident at each foot as a function of the leg swing angle. The maximum static load measured due to weight of the vehicle was approximately 13 kN. The subsequent soil settlement and failure were estimated based on the theories of elasticity and <b>plastic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> as well as the shallow foundation theories. The dynamic load as a function of the leg actuating hydraulic cylinders was also considered for predicting the soil response. Comparisons between the different performance parameters of tracked vehicles and the designed legged vehicle were made. The shear stress-shear displacement relationship for different types of terrain was considered to predict the traction available for each foot during locomotion under different slip conditions. It was observed that the foot with grousers (lugs or teeth underneath the foot) provided more tractive effort compared to a tracked vehicle of similar dimensions and weight in cohesive soils. [...] Parametric performance models for the designed excavation system were developed based on the theories of earth moving machinery and their dynamics. The performance of the designed excavation system was evaluated based on the excavation production, spillage generated and the excavation power required under varying operational and soil conditions. [...] Parametric models were developed for evaluation of the designed pump-pipeline system by integrating the two-phase flow theories developed by various previous researchers. The models predict the total head loss in the pipeline system and hence the required pump power and also the limiting settling velocity condition and thereby the chances of pipeline blockage. In the present design this means that the suitable pipeline diameter is between 0. 15 to 0. 3 m to achieve a production of 61 m³/hr with a maximum volumetric concentration of 18 %. The mean mixture velocity in the pipeline should vary between 2 to 5 m/sec to achieve the desired production and avoid pipeline blockage. A conceptual model was developed showing the complex interrelationships existing between the dredging and locomotion processes. [...] The results from this thesis can now be used to design the requisite controllers for the automatic operation of the 'Golden Tortoise'...|$|E
