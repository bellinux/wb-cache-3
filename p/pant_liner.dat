5000|$|The uniform was {{designed}} to be warm in winter by use of a separate jacket liner and <b>pant</b> <b>liner</b> (this is why the trousers had buttoned waist tabs), both made of [...] "pile" [...] faux fur. The trouser pile liners were dropped in favor of ordinary wool trousers. The jacket liner was a separate cotton-shell jacket with two slash pockets and button and loop fastening, generally in a lighter shade of olive drab (OD3) than the main jacket but in practice rarely issued during World War II. In the ETO this was intended to be replaced by the M-1944 'Ike' jacket, or one of the generic 'ETO' jackets which could come in versions that were either near-identical to the M-1941 jacket, but in rough khaki wool outer, or versions almost identical to British Battledress, both versions being produced locally in the UK in several variations.|$|E

The Army is currently allowing temporary use of the two physical fitness uniforms: the APFU and the alternate IPFU, until it is mandatory for all US Army soldiers to wear and have purchased the APFU by September 30, 2017. The APFU is also sold at Army Military Clothing Stores and costs slightly less than the IPFU. The two uniforms are similar in appearance and features, {{with the exception of}} shirt and jacket color. However, the APFU is made from different fabrics, has a <b>pant</b> <b>liner</b> and a brief-style trunk liner, and includes unisex or female sizes for the jacket and pants. The APFU was released on October 1, 2014 and the uniform's mandatory possession date will be on the same day in 2017.|$|E
