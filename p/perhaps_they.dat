5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that all hands {{are aware of the}} decision and recognize the need for it. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> are relieved {{that they did not have}} to make it. But it is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.|$|E
5|$|As {{the pairs}} go their {{separate}} ways, an enforcer for the loan shark {{catches up with}} the duplicated pair {{to get the money}} back and they discover they have no cash. The enforcer orders Brian to decide whether he kills him or Stewie. Brian initially refuses to choose but when he panics, he tells the enforcer to shoot Stewie in the head, killing him, then the enforcer tells Brian to give him the money he and Stewie borrowed and leaves the room. Meanwhile, the real pair worry about getting caught Stewie suggest that they make a run for it and head home, but Brian fears it will endanger the family. Stewie suggests that <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> should kill themselves and Brian reluctantly agrees. They prepare to throw themselves off the top balcony of the hotel but Stewie chickens out at the last second, leaving Brian to fall to his death. A panic-stricken Stewie trips over his backpack and finds the money the other pair had won.|$|E
5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it imperative to attack. Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> were aware (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E

25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> thought Caux & Castillou were Spanish {{because they}} used Latin words for packing, such as secundo and aparejo.

25|$|The most learned {{men have}} sought to {{ascertain}} the secret, and fancied they discovered the seed. Their promises, however, were vain, and no planting was ever followed by a harvest.

25|$|The 2001 Oklahoma Commission Final Report {{notes that}} it was unusual for both Rowland and Page to be working {{downtown}} on Memorial Day, when most stores and businesses were closed. It suggests that Rowland had a simple accident, such as tripping and steadying himself against the girl, or <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> were lovers and had a quarrel.|$|E

25|$|If {{enough people}} do not think like free-riders, the private and {{voluntary}} provision of public goods may be successful. For example, a free rider might come to a public park to enjoy its beauty, yet discard litter that makes it less enjoyable for others. More public-spirited individuals don't do this (they might even pick up existing litter) – why? There could be several reasons. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> have lived nearby for years and derive pleasure from helping their community, or at least would feel ashamed if their neighbors or friends saw them. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> are emotionally attached to the environment, or the park is a national treasure; littering it would offend their patriotism. To the extent that most people behave like this (for any reason), a public good is produced: everyone enjoys a clean park, without the government needing to spend tax money on maintenance crews.|$|E
25|$|According to Eugene Volkov, the {{earliest}} Neolithic {{culture of the}} Ingala Valley should be considered the Koshkino (middle 6th millennium BC - late 5th millennium BC), and the Sosnovka-Ostrov (middle 5th millennium BC - 4th millennium BC) was the next. Boborykino culture (late 5th millennium BC - late 4th millennium BC) coexisted with the Koshkinskino and Sosnovka-Ostrov. Monuments of the Poludenskoe culture are few; <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> were functioning {{at a time when}} the surrounding area was empty.|$|E
25|$|There was a rumor of {{one final}} act to survive {{conducted}} by the USBA. The idea to turn Merl Mennenga, {{the founder of the}} ABA to somehow force Mr. Anderson and Mr. Vargas to sell back the ABA and then to sell the ABA to the USBA which would then close down the ABA under the Chapter VII bankruptcy law with the USBA inheriting the tracks ABA's then current leadership. If true, <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> were thinking about the precedent of Walt Ehnart, the former President of the ABA and by then the Vice President of the USBA that they could have turned Mennenga. However unlikely it would have been, nothing came of it.|$|E

25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> {{have written}} exhaustively on this topic, {{and their work}} did not reach us. There are many sciences. There have been {{numerous}} sages among the nations of mankind. The knowledge that has not come down to us {{is larger than the}} knowledge that has. Where are the sciences of the Persians that ‘Umar ordered to be wiped out {{at the time of the}} conquest? Where are the sciences of the Chaladaeans, the Syrians and the Babylonians, and the scholarly products and results that were theirs? Where are the sciences of the Copts, their predecessors? The sciences of only one nation, the Greeks, have come down to us, because they were translated through Al-Ma'mun's efforts. He was successful in this direction because he had many translators at his disposal and spent much money in this connection.|$|E
25|$|Cast iron {{development}} lagged in Europe, as the smelters {{could only}} achieve temperatures of about 1000 C; or <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> {{did not want}} hotter temperatures, as they were seeking to produce blooms as a precursor of wrought iron, not cast iron. Through {{a good portion of}} the Middle Ages, in Western Europe, iron was still being made by the working of iron blooms into wrought iron. Some of the earliest casting of iron in Europe occurred in Sweden, in two sites, Lapphyttan and Vinarhyttan, between 1150 and 1350. Some scholars have speculated the practice followed the Mongols across Russia to these sites, but there is no clear proof of this hypothesis, and it would certainly not explain the pre-Mongol datings of many of these iron-production centres. In any event, by the late 14th century, a market for cast iron goods began to form, as a demand developed for cast iron cannonballs.|$|E
25|$|On the {{borrowing}} end, after 10–20 years, the S 500 corporations {{become extremely}} accustomed to obtaining funds via these money markets, {{which are very}} stable. Initially, <b>perhaps</b> <b>they</b> only borrowed in these markets for a highly seasonal cash needs, being a net borrower for only say 90 days per year. They would borrow here as they experienced their deepest cash needs over an operating cycle to temporarily finance short-term build ups in inventory and receivables. Or, they moved to this funding market from a former bank revolving line of credit, that was guaranteed {{to be available to}} them as they needed it, but had to be cleaned up to a zero balance for at least 60 days out of the year. In these situations the corporations had sufficient other equity and debt financing for all of their regular capital needs. They were however dependent on these sources to be available to them, as needed, on an immediate daily basis.|$|E

25|$|The {{passing of}} the Land Drainage Act 1930 held promise for the future. The many bodies {{responsible}} for small parts of Somerset's flood defences were swept away, and replaced by the Somerset Catchment Board. More importantly, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>they</b> {{did not have to}} prove that benefits would occur to a particular community in order to issue rates for drainage work, but could raise rates based on the rateable values of properties. This should have worked, but they soon became apprehensive, and reverted to producing reports, which were not actioned. However, inactivity gave way to action in 1939, when a new engineer was appointed, who saw it as his job to direct what needed to be done. Work began on improvements to the King's Sedgemoor Drain in 1939. The items to be addressed were the size of the channel, the size of the bridges, and the size of Dunball clyse, all of which were too small. The onset of the Second World War, just a few months later, threatened to stop the scheme, but did not.|$|E
25|$|Briseis wasn't {{the only}} {{sensation}} surrounding the 1876 Melbourne Cup. Two {{months before the}} event, on Saturday 9 September, the City of Melbourne sailed for Melbourne from Sydney with a cargo including 13 racehorses, {{many of whom were}} considered serious contenders for the Melbourne Cup. The following day the ship ran into a savage storm and was hit by several rogue waves, with Nemesis (the winner of the 1876 AJC Metropolitan Handicap in Randwick, Sydney and favourite for the Cup, owned by John Moffat) and Robin Hood (another favourite, owned by Etienne de Mestre) being among the 11 horses that were killed. Betting on the big race was paralysed. To the dismay and anger of the public, bookmakers, showing no feeling, presented a purse (loaded with coins) to the captain as token of their appreciation for his part in saving them many thousands of pounds in bets already laid on the favourites who had perished. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> should have kept their money, however. The outsider Briseis comfortably won by 1 length in the biggest field of all time, and in an extremely good time, so {{it is unlikely that the}} horses who perished could have beaten her.|$|E
25|$|Much {{international}} attention was attracted especially {{by the discovery}} of an extremely rare find, a life-sized sandstone statue or stele, dating from the 5th century BC, which was found just outside the larger tumulus. The stele, fully preserved except for its feet, depicts an armed male warrior. It measures 186cm in height and weighs 230kg. It is made from a type of sandstone available within a few kilometres of Glauberg. Much detail is clearly visible: his trousers, composite armour tunic, wooden shield and a typical La Tène sword hanging from his right side. The moustachioed man wears a torc with three pendants, remarkably {{similar to the one}} from the chamber in mound 1, several rings on both arms and one on the right hand. On his head, he wears a hood-like headdress crowned by two protrusions, resembling the shape of a mistletoe leaf. Such headdresses are also known from a handful of contemporary sculptures. As mistletoe is believed to have held a magical or religious significance to the Celts, it could indicate that the warrior depicted also played the role of a priest. Fragments of three similar statues were also discovered in the area. It is suggested that all four statues once stood in the rectangular enclosure. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>they</b> were associated with an ancestor cult.|$|E
