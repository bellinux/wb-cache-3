40|$|Advances in {{the area}} of {{structural}} testing have in recent years led to hybrid simulation, that is, the advanced structural experimental method that encompasses the traditional <b>pseudodynamic</b> <b>testing</b> <b>method</b> and relies on substructuring to offer the advantage of combining the actual experimental testing of selected parts of the structure to the numerical treatment of the rest. The experimental part usually involves simplified test setups and structural elements with few degrees of freedom. Thus, issues of cross-coupling present in testing MDOF structures have not been treated adequately so far. In addition, it has been realized {{that when it comes to}} testing very stiff structures, in which the above phenomena are accentuated, further problems arise in relation to the quality of actuator control (accuracy of imposed displacements and stability of the test process). Few studies have focused on these issues, thus necessitating more work in the future.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the experimental, {{numerical}} and design-oriented investigation of plane steel-concrete composite frames under severe earthquake loading. The basic tests consisted in the loading of four different large-scale types of composite frames with actual, measured accelerograms (El Centro, Friuli). In this connection, the earthquake simulation was realized {{by means of the}} <b>pseudodynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>method.</b> Parallel to the tests, a finite-element-model was developed, taking the relevant material and geometric nonlinearities into account. Applied to each of the four types of frames in a step-by-step integration procedure, the model reproduced the experimental results in very good approximation. For the design investigations, the models of the frames were varied and numerous, typical design situations were considered. Thus, the applicability of the principal design concept of Eurocode 8 could be confirmed. The concept implies the employment of the response spectrum method combined with a behaviour factor. (orig.)

40|$|The <b>pseudodynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> is a {{tool for}} obtaining the {{non-linear}} response of structures to transient ground acceleration. The modelling technique relies on representing the inertial and viscous damping components of the equation of motion computationally, while obtaining {{a measure of the}} non-linear elastic restoring forces experimentally. A pseudodynamic implementation system is presented, displaying innovations within both the computational and experimental domains. A SDOF pseudodynamic test facility has been designed and manufactured employing a computer controlled servo-hydraulic actuator system. The experimental facility enables displacements of up to 50 mm under forces of up to 50 kN with all required instrumentation. The experimental apparatus is controlled by algorithms running in the LabView environment, fully integrated within the execution system, rendering the requirement for a hardware controller obsolete. The execution system allows interactive control of the experiments, and offers a large range options with respect to both control and time integration. The execution routine incorporates both the time integration and control algorithms, and combines these such that they effectively execute as an integrated system. This enables semi-continuous implementation of the pseudodynamic tests with very limited resources. A novel, integral form time stepping scheme is proposed, based on an explicit integral form algorithm (Chang et al. 1998) and the Newmark Implicit scheme. The proposed formulation offers an implicit, and thus unconditionally stable alternative to Chang's algorithm without introducing further approximations. This yields improved dissipation and accuracy properties in addition to enabling combination of the integral form schemes' advantages of representing non-linear force variations during a time step with an unlimited time step size. The improvements have been shown both through analytical analyses and numerical examples in linear and non-linear systems. Implementation of the implicit integral form algorithm has been enabled by coding parts of the algorithm directly into the digital controller...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{methods and}} their {{innovative}} applications to earthquake engineering are an invaluable and irreplaceable tool to throw light onto {{a number of}} complex matters related to the behaviour of structural systems under seismic excitation. It is commonly acknowledged {{that the development of}} code formulations for the design or assessment of earthquake resistant structures and the assessment and validation of said approaches could not have been achieved but through extensive experimental activity. For this reason, in the last decades, very considerable research efforts and economic resources have been allocated, in Europe and worldwide, to the development of increasingly accurate and state-of-the-art facilities and testing methods and algorithms, {{to the point of being}} virtually able of experimentally reproducing and studying any structural problem, in many cases removing limitations previously deemed inherent to experiments, due to the incredibly fast-paced growth of computational capacities. Nevertheless, for accurate, grand, expensive and extensive as an experimental campaign can be, for long-standing and active a facility or laboratory can be, there will always be aspects of challenge, novelty, peculiarity inherent in any new experimental campaign, requiring tailoring ad-hoc procedures, solutions, in some cases ¿expedients¿ to fully and correctly study the problem at hand. The European Laboratory for Structural Assessment (ELSA) of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, located in Ispra (VA), Italy, with its reaction wall facility, the largest in Europe, has been at the forefront of the development and upgrading of the <b>pseudodynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>method</b> to study the seismic response of virtually any kind of large scale structures of civil engineering. In the paper, the peculiar aspects, from the experimental point of view, of the pseudodynamic testing campaigns carried out in the framework of three recent research projects are thus presented and discussed, with reference to the peculiar issues posed by each of them and the strategy adopted to solve them, and to the effectiveness of said strategies, comparing the results that were derived to the originally planned requirements and the expected outcomes of the campaigns, with the goal of showing how flexibility, problem-solving attitude and open-mindedness were the basic prerequisites for the success of the very challenging experimental activity of a modern, large and state-of the art laboratory.

40|$|A new {{real-time}} substructure <b>method</b> for <b>testing</b> systems under {{dynamic loading}} is described. The method separates a complex system into a physical, possibly nonlinear, subsystem (to be tested experimentally at large scale) and a surrounding linear system, modeled numerically.

This behavior may be impossible to model computationally, and the method overcomes problems associated with scaling and time-dependent effects associated with current shaking table and <b>pseudodynamic</b> <b>test</b> <b>methods.</b> Dynamic forces are applied to the numerical model, and the resulting displacements at the interface between the two subsystems are applied to the physical system using servohydraulic actuators. The restoring forces are then measured and fed back to the numerical model, so that the response for the next time step can be calculated. The technique {{can be applied to}} a wide range of complex, linear/nonlinear systems such as structures with localized plastic deformation, soil-structure interaction, or vehicle-suspension interaction.

40|$|Small-scale {{models have}} been {{frequently}} used for experimental test of seismic performance because of limited testing facilities and economic reasons. However, {{there are not enough}} studies on similitude law for analogizing prototype structures accurately with small-scale models, although conventional similitude law based on geometry is not well consistent in the inelastic seismic behavior. When fabricating prototype and small-scale model of reinforced concrete structures by using the same material, added mass is demanded from a volumetric change and scale factor could be limited due to size of aggregate. Therefore, it is desirable that different material is used for small-scale models. Thus, a modified similitude law could be derived depending on geometric scale factor, equivalent modulus ratio and ultimate strain ratio. In this study, compressive strength tests are conducted to analyze the equivalent modulus ratio of micro-concrete to normal-concrete. Then, equivalent modulus ratios are divided into multi-phase damage levels, which are basically dependent on ultimate strain level. Therefore, an algorithm adaptable to the <b>pseudodynamic</b> <b>test,</b> considering equivalent multi-phase similitude law based on seismic damage levels, is developed. In addition, prior to the experiment, it is numerically verified if the developed algorithm is applicable to the <b>pseudodynamic</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{distributed}} control strategy is presented {{that supports the}} implementation of hybrid (<b>pseudodynamic)</b> <b>testing</b> with geographically distributed substructures. The objectives of the {{distributed control}}ler are: (1) to provide a scalable framework for multiple substructure testing at distributed sites and (2) to improve {{the reliability of the}} test results by minimizing strain-rate and force relaxation errors in the remote experimental substructures. The control strategy is based on a multi-threaded simulation coordinator combined with an event-driven controller at the remote experimental sites. The multi-threaded coordinator is applied to simultaneously load multiple remote substructures at different sites. The event-driven remote site controller allows for the implementation of continuous hybrid simulation algorithms on distributed models where computation, network communication and other tasks may have random completion times.

Optimizing the experimental programme reduces the risk of either wasting time and resources or missing some of the fundamental ingredients of the structural behaviour because of oversimplification or inclusion of too many elements at the same time. The European Laboratory for Structural Assessment and ASSOBETON have been involved in many research programmes aimed at studying the seismic behaviour of precast concrete structures, with different goals and different levels of complexity. A first programme was aimed at obtaining information about the cyclic behaviour of precast concrete columns. This apparently simple task resulted into an innovative experimental setup because of the need to properly allow for the elongation of the rebars in the region above the pocket foundation. A second programme was aimed at comparing the behaviour of precast and cast in situ frames, and involved the cyclic and <b>pseudodynamic</b> <b>testing</b> of two different mock-ups.
