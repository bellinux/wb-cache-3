5000|$|The name <b>pulasan</b> {{comes from}} the Malay word pulas (twist) related to [...] "pilas" [...] (remove) of Tagalog. The fruit is opened through the act of {{twisting}} the fruit with both hands, thus the name <b>pulasan.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>pulasan,</b> Nephelium mutabile Blume (family Sapindaceae), is a {{tropical}} fruit closely allied to the rambutan and sometimes confused with it. It has various common names, including <b>pulasan</b> in English, Spanish and Malay, kapulasan in Indonesia, ngoh-khonsan in Thailand, and bulala or panungayan in the Philippines.|$|E

50|$|Sapindaceae {{includes}} {{many species of}} economically valuable tropical fruit, including the lychee, longan, pitomba, guinip/mamoncillo, korlan, rambutan, <b>pulasan</b> and ackee. Other products include guarana, soapberries and maple syrup.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pulasan</b> is ultra-tropical and thrives only in very humid regions between 360 and 1,150 ft (110-350 m) of altitude. In Malaya, it is {{said that}} the tree bears best after a long, dry season.|$|E
50|$|While {{very similar}} to rambutan, the fruit lacks the hairy spines. The flesh is very sweet and juicy, and {{separates}} easily from the seed, much more easily than the rambutan. In addition, unlike the seed of the rambutan, the seed of the <b>pulasan</b> is readily edible raw. It has a flavour somewhat {{similar to that of}} almonds.|$|E
50|$|Rasah {{has many}} housing estates {{encircling}} it - Kampung Dato Mansor, Kampung Pasir, Taman Sri <b>Pulasan,</b> Taman Lian, Taman Nee Yan, Taman Klana Jubli, Taman Bukit Chedang, Taman Dato' Raja Mohd Hanifah, Taman Rasah, Taman Rasah Jaya, Taman Desa Rasah, Taman Harapan Baru, Taman Happy, Taman Thivy Jaya, Taman Sri Putih, Taman Nuri Indah, Taman Anggur, Taman Bukit Rasah, Taman Belimbing, and so forth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pulasan</b> is {{native to}} Peninsular Malaysia. Wild trees are {{infrequent}} in lowland forests around Perak, Malaysia but abundant in the Philippines at low elevations from Luzon to Mindanao. The tree has long been cultivated in the Malay Peninsula and Thailand; is rarely domesticated in the Philippines. Ochse reported that there were extensive plantings in Java only around Bogor and the villages along the railway between Bogor and Jakarta.|$|E
50|$|The {{tree was}} planted at the Trujillo Plant Propagation Station in Puerto Rico in 1926 and young trees from Java {{were sent to}} the Lancetilla Experimental Garden, Tela, Honduras, in 1927. The latter were said in 1945 to be doing well at Tela and fruiting moderately. The <b>pulasan</b> is little known {{elsewhere}} in the New World except in Costa Rica where it is occasionally grown and the fruits sometimes appear on the market.|$|E
50|$|You will easily {{notice a}} variety of local fruit trees along the Plieran river bank with the most common being local fruit such as durian, rambutan, <b>pulasan,</b> bamboo, terap, langsat, 'eman', 'nanga' or sago palm (Eugeissona utilis), 'mali' and 'bua' alim' (wild mango) {{when you take a}} boat ride from Plieran bridge at Long Ampan Aing, Long Bora, Long Taa, Ka Laeh to Lidung Jelo (upstream). All these crops were planted by the Kenyah Badeng people in 1820's-1900's the Penan in Plieran {{acknowledged}} that.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pulasan</b> tree is an ornamental. It attains {{a height}} of 10-15 m and has a short trunk to 30-40 cm thick. The branchlets are brown and hairy when young. The {{alternate}} leaves, pinnate or odd-pinnate, are 17-45 cm long, have 2 to 5 pairs of opposite or nearly opposite leaflets, are oblong or elliptic-lanceolate, 6.25-17.5 cm long and up to 5 cm wide; slightly wavy, dark-green and barely glossy on the upper surface; pale, and somewhat bluish, with a few short, silky hairs on the underside. Very small, greenish, petalless flowers with 4-5 hairy sepals are borne singly or in clusters on {{the branches of the}} erect, axillary or terminal, panicles clothed with fine yellowish or brownish hairs.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pulasan</b> (Nephelium ramboutan-ake (Labill.) Leenh) {{fruit is}} highly similar to {{rambutan}} rapiah (Nephelium lappaceum) fruit with ovate shape, {{sweet and sour}} fresh taste, {{but it has a}} thick rind. The diversity of <b>pulasan</b> is little informed including in Bogor. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the genetic diversity of <b>pulasan</b> from Bogor revealed by microsatellite marker. The DNA of 63 individuals from 10 populations of <b>pulasan</b> were extracted using CTAB method and amplified using two primer sets, LMLY 6 (GA) 9 (CA) 2 (GA) 4 dan LMLY 12 (CT) 11. DNA amplification product was visualized and arranged in a matrix of binary data then analyzed the value of the number of different alleles (Na), the number of effective alleles (Ne), Shannon information index (I), heterozygosity (He), and the percentage of polymorphism (PLP). The results of the analysis showed the highest genetic diversity was found in North Bogor (He= 0. 313). The genetic diversity within a population (61 %) was higher than that among populations (39 %). A dendrogram was constructed using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with arithmetic Mean (UPGMA). The similarity index ranged from 52 to 100 % that means there are close relationships among individuals. Cluster analyses grouped some individuals originated from different locations in the same group. The levels of heterozygosity within a population was determined by the history of each individual in a population...|$|E

40|$|AbstractToday, {{world is}} facing the {{increasing}} energy demand, {{security of energy supply}} and reduction of emissions. Energy consumption which accounts for 60 % global greenhouse gas emissions has mainly contributed to climate change. Renewable energy is an appropriate way to satisfy energy consumption without environmental degradation. Solar energy {{is one of the most}} promising renewable energy sources today. In recent years, organic solar cells (OSCs) which are a promising alternative to conventional inorganic devices have received much attention. In this research, OSCs are developed from organic material; <b>Pulasan</b> (Nephelium mutabile Labill), Kemunting (Rhodomyrtus tomentosa) and Poly (3 - Dodecylthiophene) (P 3 DT). These OSCs are facbricated accordingly bulk heterojunction of ITO/P 3 DT+natural dye/Au via electrochemical method at room temperature. The OSCs was deposited onto heated substrate from 50 ̊C to 200 ̊C. From four point probes (FPP) data revealed that electrical conductivity increases by the increment of light intensity and temperature of substrate. Then, the samples were examined using Hall Effect measurement to obtain the type of sample, Hall mobility, and highest charge carrier in the sample of OSCs. Both samples detected was N-type of charge carrier from Hall effect measurement...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of Nephelium ramboutan-ake (<b>pulasan)</b> rind in selected human cancer cell lines. The crude ethanol extract and fractions (ethyl acetate and aqueous) of N. ramboutan-ake inhibited the growth of HT- 29, HCT- 116, MDA-MB- 231, Ca Ski cells according to MTT assays. The N. ramboutan-ake aqueous fraction (NRAF) was found to exert the greatest cytotoxic effect against HT- 29 in a dose-dependent manner. Evidence of apoptotic cell death was revealed by features such as chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation and apoptotic body formation. The result from a TUNEL assay strongly suggested that NRAF brings about DNA fragmentation in HT- 29 cells. Phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization on the outer leaflet of plasma membranes was detected with annexin V-FITC/PI binding, confirming the early stage of apoptosis. The mitochondrial permeability transition is an important step in the induction of cellular apoptosis, and the results clearly suggested that NRAF led to collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential in HT- 29 cells. This attenuation of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was accompanied by increased production of ROS and depletion of GSH, an increase of Bax protein expression, and induced-activation of caspase- 3 / 7 and caspase- 9. These combined results suggest that NRAF induces mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the cytotoxic effect and elucidate the possible underlying apoptotic mechanisms of Nephelium ramboutan-ake (<b>pulasan)</b> rind in selected human cancer cell lines. The crude ethanol extract and fractions (ethyl acetate and aqueous) of N. ramboutan-ake reduced the cell viability of HT- 29, HCT- 116, MDA-MB- 231, Ca Ski cells by MTT assay. The N. ramboutan-ake aqueous fraction (NRAF) was found to exert the most potent cytotoxic effect against HT- 29 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Further investigation for its plausible mechanisms was conducted by using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. This study confirmed the induction of apoptosis by a series of archetypal apoptotic features such as chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, cell shrinkage and apoptotic body formation by Hoechst 33342 /PI dual staining. The apoptotic mechanisms were further substantiated with the detection of DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assay and phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization on the outer leaflet of plasma membrane which detected by annexin V-FITC/PI binding confirming the early stage of apoptosis. In addition, mitochondrial permeability transition is a vital step in the induction of cellular apoptosis, and data clearly revealed that NRAF resulted in disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) in HT- 29 cells. Dissipation of Δψm was indicated through a series of evidences such as increased generation of ROS and depletion of GSH, upregulation of Bax protein expression, as well as activation of caspase- 3 / 7 and caspase- 9. Collectively, these results suggested that NRAF induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis...|$|E
