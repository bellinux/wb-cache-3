"If the <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Stage</b> Company {{want to keep}} up {{with the}} times, and not {{degenerate}} into the old style 'one hoss' road-wagon business, they'd better make some reform on the line. They might begin by shipping off some of the old-time whiskey-guzzling drivers who are too high and mighty to do anything but handle the ribbons, and are above speaking to a passenger unless he's a favorite or one of their set. Over-praise for an occasional scrimmage with road agents, and flattery from Eastern greenhorns, have given them the big head. If the fool-killer were let loose on the line with a big club, and knocked a little civility into their heads, it wouldn't be a bad thing, and would be a particular relief to the passengers for Gilead who have to take the stage from Simpson's Bar." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was thus}} {{recorded}} in the county paper: [...] "A piece of rare good fortune, involving, it is said, {{the development of a}} lead of extraordinary value, has lately fallen to the lot of Mr. John Silsbee, the popular blacksmith, {{on the site of the}} old Medliker Ranch. In clearing out the failing water-course known as Burnt Spring, Mr. Silsbee came upon a rich ledge or pocket at the actual source of the spring,--a fissure in the ground a few rods from the road. The present yield has been estimated to be from eight to ten thousand dollars. But the event is considered as one of the most remarkable instances of the vagaries of 'prospecting' ever known, as this valuable 'pot-hole' existed undisturbed for EIGHT YEARS not FIFTY YARDS from the old cabin that was in former times the residence of J. Medliker, Esq., and the station of the <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Stage</b> Company, and was utterly unknown and unsuspected by the previous inhabitants! Verily truth is stranger than fiction!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Undeterred by {{his earlier}} struggles, Ormsby moved to Genoa, Utah Territory (later Nevada) in 1857 {{as an agent}} for the <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Stage</b> Line.

Ormsby presided over a meeting in Genoa which selected Judge James Crane to go to Washington, D.C. in an effort to create a new territory, which they thought should be named [...] "Sierra Nevada".

5000|$|Mail and {{passenger}} stages usually went {{at night to}} avoid most of the slower (~3 mph) wagon traffic. As counted in 1862, {{the average number of}} passengers carried each day on the Placerville Routes <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Stage</b> Company line with 12 coaches and 600 horses averaged about 37 passengers/day. Horses were changed at roughly every 10-20 mile intervals and the drivers often vied to make the fastest time. A typical stage trip took approximately 18 hours from Placerville to Virginia City with an 18-hour return. Holdups, stage wrecks and other accidents were an occasional occurrence on both routes. In 1864, stage receipts were estimated by newspapers of the time to be about $527,000 at $27.00 per passenger on the Placerville route. The Henness Pass roads California Stage Company and Nevada Stage Line carried somewhat fewer passengers. Both stage coach routes together were estimated by newspapers of the day to have gross receipts, including mail subsidies, of over $1,000,000 total in 1864. The typical freight charges were about $120.00 to $160.00/ton (6-8 cents/pound) with am additional $20.00 to $30.00 toll charges/wagon. A Central Pacific Railroad agent (J. R. Atkins) estimated, after counting all Placerville toll road traffic in August and September 1862, that the freight charges to Virginia City over the Placerville route would have been about $5,000,000, which delivered roughly 20000000 lb of freight in eight weeks. Similar amounts presumable were shipped over the Henness pass route. In a given month during the busy season, over 2,000 wagons (sometimes up to three wagons were pulled by one team) and over 10,000 draft animals (mostly mules) per month were counted on the Placerville road alone in 1862. [...] The Placerville Route and Henness Pass route even had sprinkler wagons that wetted down the road during daylight hours about every three hours to minimize dust and wear and tear on the road. There were 93 hotels, stage relay stations and lodging stations located along the Placerville Route with similar stations along the Henness Pass route located at roughly ten mile (16 km) intervals. The teamsters stayed at these locations {{at the end of each}} days travel. The Placerville Route tried to stay open in winter to at least horse traffic and was only closed temporarily by winter storms. The Pony Express used this route in the summer and winter of 1860-61. The net profit per year from these toll roads was probably over $100,000/yr in 1862 and increasing every year.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} stop the {{continuous}} decline of typical dune slack communities along the Dutch coast, restoration projects {{have been carried out}} since 1952. Restoration measures consisted of re-introducing traditional management techniques in dune slacks, such as mowing, grazing and sod removal, or constructing artificial dune slacks to compensate for lost biodiversity elsewhere. An analysis of successful and unsuccessful projects showed that constructing new dune slacks was not very successful for maintaining new populations of endangered dune slack species, since such projects were often carried out in areas where seed banks were depleted, while hydrological conditions and seed dispersal mechanisms were sub-optimal. The construction of sand dikes to prevent sea intrusion in large beach plains was, unintentionally, a temporary success for the establishment of many Red List species, although such measures often disrupted natural dune slack formation. Successful sites were all characterised by a regular discharge of calcareous groundwater provided by local or regional hydrological systems, where not very long ago populations of typical dune slack plants were present. Under such conditions, sod removal was a successful measure to create <b>pioneer</b> <b>stages</b> which were relatively stable, due to a very slow accumulation of organic matter in the topsoil. It is argued that new and more flexible coastal defence strategies can provide new opportunities for natural and relatively stable <b>pioneer</b> <b>stages</b> of dune slack formation, suitable for the long term preservation of endangered dune slack species. ...|$|R

30|$|A {{practical}} {{consequence is}} that dominance of fire prone species groups, {D, E, F}, in the end, including rockroses, brooms, and small heaths, is expected over sclerophyllous paleomediterranean tall-shrubs (also mesophytic forest shrubs, e.g., {A,B,C}) if fire regime is intense and in short periods. The pine tree, {{which is the}} ecologically dominant plant, seems to align with the fire-sensitive group but with some emergence capacity if seeds are fairly protected by deeper soil layers (i.e., group B). The major ecological issue is that our results suggest that succession in Portuguese pine forests is drawn back to fire-prone <b>pioneer</b> <b>stages</b> by regular fires and kept that way for long periods.|$|R
