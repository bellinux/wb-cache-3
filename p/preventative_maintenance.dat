25|$|GS-X (1999) – Incorporated {{a setting}} table and ball {{accelerator}} redesign that reduced {{the amount of}} parts, the number of adjustments, {{and the amount of}} preventive maintenance required. In 2000 the GS-X consolidated electronics was replaced with a single box electrical system called the NexGen Controller. This change reduced the overall size, weight, and number of electrical components needed to operate the pinsetters and made the setup for the machine more user-friendly. An additional modification lowered the overall profile of the pinsetter, allowing it to be installed in centers with low ceilings and reducing the number of parts and adjustments and the amount of <b>preventative</b> <b>maintenance</b> required.|$|E

30|$|The {{feasibility}} of monitoring the dipped rail joint defects has been theoretically investigated by simulating a locomotive-mounted acceleration system negotiating {{several types of}} dipped rail defects. Initially, a comprehensive locomotive-track model was developed using the multi-body dynamics approach. In this model, the locomotive car-body, bogie frames, wheelsets and driving motors are considered as rigid bodies; track modelling was also taken into account. A quantitative relationship between the characteristics (peak–peak values) of the axle box accelerations and the rail defects was determined through simulations. Therefore, the proposed approach, which combines defect analysis and comparisons with theoretical results, will enhance the ability for long-term monitoring and assessment of track systems and provides more informed <b>preventative</b> track <b>maintenance</b> strategies.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, batch by batch {{reliability}} of buses could be unpredictable and often required running adjustments. The combination the build quality of early AEC vehicles and the professionalism of the Corporation's garage staff produced in-service mileage figures and engine life that Commercial Motor praised as [...] "exceptionally good". Measures taken included mandatory defect reporting by drivers {{at the end}} of each shift, a <b>preventative</b> <b>maintenance</b> regime which called for inspection/repairs every 10 days (with the spare parts inventory including complete engines) with close monitoring of parts usage, and an overhaul/repaint cycle of every 18 months. In order to improve the system, the Corporation was performing its own modifications to buses as early as 1921, experimenting with a new type of rear shock absorber using rubber pads on one of its Leylands, and widening the doors of buses during overhaul. Examples of in-house innovation included portable bus electrics testing apparatus in 1932 and the establishment in the 1940s of a soap making plant inside the Laundry at Shrubhill Depot, in response to the need for a soap which didn't damage vehicle paintwork.|$|E

40|$|Sensing {{technology}} is a cornerstone for many industrial applications. Manufacturing plants and engineering facilities, such as shipboard engine rooms, require sensors to ensure product quality and efficient and safe operation. We focus on one representative application, <b>preventative</b> equipment <b>maintenance,</b> in which vibration signatures are gathered to predict equipment failure. Based on application requirements and site surveys, we develop a general architecture for this class of industrial applications. This architecture meets the application’s data fidelity needs through careful state preservation and over-sampling. We describe the impact of implementing the architecture on two sensing platforms with differing processor and communication capabilities. We present a systematic performance comparison between these platforms {{in the context of}} the application. We also describe our experience and lessons learned in two settings: in a semiconductor fabrication plant and onboard an oil tanker in the North Sea. Finally, we establish design guidelines for an ideal platform and architecture for industrial applications. This paper includes several unique contributions: a study of the impact of platform on architecture, a comparison of two deployments in the same application class, and a demonstration of application return on investment.

30|$|Maintaining {{equipment}} {{in a proper}} working state is {{an important aspect of}} manufacturing. However, industrial equipment maintenance is an expensive activity that can account for over 30  % of a facilities annual operating costs, and between 60 and 75  % of a machines lifecycle cost [6]. These figures will vary from site-to-site {{depending on the type of}} equipment being maintained, and maintenance strategies being employed. Maintenance strategies range from those that focus on reacting to issues when they arise, to those that focus on preventing issues from occurring. Strategies that embrace a predictive and <b>preventative</b> approach to <b>maintenance</b> are well suited to smart manufacturing, given their affinity to optimising machine uptime and availability. Most maintenance strategies are supported by information systems that monitor particular measurements (e.g. temperature, revolutions per minute, etc.) from {{equipment in}} the factory. However, a criticism of existing real-time maintenance systems is their inability to describe, predict or prescribe specific maintenance actions [19].|$|R

40|$|This paper studies a multiple-recipe {{predictive}} maintenance problem with M/G/ 1 queueing e ects. The server degrades {{according to a}} discrete-time Markov chain and {{we assume that the}} controller knows both the machine status and the current number of jobs in the system. The controller's objective is to minimize total discounted costs or long-run average costs which include <b>preventative</b> and corrective <b>maintenance</b> costs, holdings costs, and possibly production costs. An optimal policy determines both when to perform maintenance and which type of job to process. Since the policy takes into account the machine's degradation status, such control decisions are known as {{predictive maintenance}} policies. In the single-recipe case, we prove that the optimal policy is monotone in the machine status, but not in the number of jobs in the system. A similar monotonicity result holds in the two-recipe case. Finally, we provide computational results indicating that signi cant savings can be realized when implementing a predictive maintenance policies instead of a traditional job-based threshold policy for PMs. ...|$|R
