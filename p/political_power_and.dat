5|$|Many voters {{decried the}} bill as a self-serving attempt by Goebel to {{increase}} his <b>political</b> <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> the election board remained a controversial issue until its abolition in a special session of the legislature in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Himmler began {{developing}} {{the notion of}} a Germanic religion and wanted SS members to leave the church. In early 1936, Heydrich left the Catholic Church. His wife, Lina, had already done so the year before. Heydrich not only felt he could no longer be a member, but came to consider the church's <b>political</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> influence a danger to the state.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Evans {{acknowledged}} that membership levels had declined but predicted a dramatic turnaround would soon occur. His prediction was inaccurate. This loss of members {{resulted in a}} Klan that was a skeleton of its former self. Historians have attributed this loss of membership to ineptness and hypocrisy {{on the part of}} Klan leadership. McVeigh argues that the Klan's inability to form alliances with other political groups led to the sharp loss of <b>political</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> solidarity within the group.|$|E

50|$|The main issues {{concerning}} mainstream media in Turkey are the heavy concentration of ownership, the widespread self-censorship of journalists and media professionals (also {{due to their}} vulnerability to <b>political</b> <b>powers)</b> <b>and</b> the presence of nationalist rhetoric and hate speech.|$|R
5|$|A known {{historical}} {{resident of}} Zaprešić was Count Josip Jelačić of Bužim (1801–59), the Ban of Croatia from 1848 until his death. Although born in Novi Sad, Serbia (then Habsburg Monarchy), {{he received an}} estate in Zaprešić together with his title. He is responsible for abolishing serfdom in Croatia in 1848, but also for an infamous suppression of Croatian intelligentsia, and the Illyrian movement during his reign under the orders of Baron Alexander von Bach, and Emperor Franz Joseph I. A statue of Jelačić riding a horse was constructed by Anton Dominik Fernkorn, and placed on the Zagreb's central square, Ban Jelačić Square. The statue has been repeatedly removed, and reinstated during changes in <b>political</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> orientation in Croatia, from monarchist, through ultra-nationalist, and communist, up to democratic. After the Croatian declaration of independence, marking {{the start of the}} democratic era, the statue was returned to the square, and Zaprešić credits Jelačić with a major arterial road named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|At {{one stop}} on the book tour {{associated}} with the publication and release of the book at the David A. Clarke School of Law of the University of the District of Columbia, Jackson's message was perceived as saying that American history can be studied as an analysis of race, but that economics and the tension between states’ rights and federal rights are the true basis of a domestic history revolving around pursuit of economic development, <b>political</b> <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> personal freedom. He then advanced the theory that these pursuits would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments, guaranteeing rights primarily grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the U.S. has ratified. Each is discussed in a separate chapter: the rights to quality health care, housing, education, a clean environment, fair taxes, full employment, equality for women, {{and the right to}} vote.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, Lajjun was {{replaced}} by Jenin as the administrative capital of the sanjak which now included the Sanjak of Ajlun. By the 19th century it was renamed Sanjak Jenin, although Ajlun was separated from it. Zahir al-Umar, who became the effective ruler of the Galilee {{for a short period}} {{during the second half of}} the 18th century, was reported to have used cannons against Lajjun in the course of his campaign between 1771-1773 to capture Nablus. It is possible that this attack led to the village's decline in the years that followed. By that time, Lajjun's influence was diminished by the increasing strength of Acre's <b>political</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> Nablus's economic muscle.|$|E

50|$|These regimes were {{progressive}} {{in terms}} of the colonial development that had occurred thus far.

50|$|Moreover, {{in spite}} of his {{unacknowledged}} use of Western studies Adamiyat dismisses them all as ‘Western rubbish’ (bunjul-i farangī). In a characteristically caustic tone he accuses western specialists of fabrication, charlatanism, being in the service of <b>political</b> <b>powers,</b> <b>and</b> entertaining ‘Jewish evil designs’ (aghrāḍ-i yahūdīgarī).|$|R
5|$|Marx's {{theories}} about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as Marxism—hold that human societies develop through class struggle. In capitalism, this {{manifests itself in}} {{the conflict between the}} ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour power in return for wages. Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: socialism. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature, would eventuate the working class' development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of <b>political</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively fought for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.|$|E
5|$|Qin Shi Huang, {{the first}} {{ruler of the}} Qin dynasty, {{established}} China's imperial system of government in 221 BC after unifying the Seven Warring States through conquest, bringing to an end the Warring States period. For a time, the rulers of the warring states claimed nominal allegiance to an overlord king of the Zhou dynasty (c. 1050 – 256 BC), yet the Zhou kings' <b>political</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> prestige was {{less than that of}} later Chinese emperors. The imperial system fell apart after the fall of Qin in 206 BC. However, following Han's victory over Chu, the King of Han reestablished the imperial system and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu (r. 202–195 BC).|$|E
5|$|The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles {{had their}} {{origins in the}} Indian {{independence}} movement, which strove to achieve the values of liberty and social welfare as the goals of an independent Indian state. The development of constitutional rights in India was inspired by historical documents such as England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. The demand for civil liberties formed {{an important part of}} the Indian independence movement, with one of the objectives of the Indian National Congress (INC) being to end discrimination between the British rulers and their Indian subjects. This demand was explicitly mentioned in resolutions adopted by the INC between 1917 and 1919. The demands articulated in these resolutions included granting to Indians the rights to equality before law, free speech, trial by juries composed at least half of Indian members, <b>political</b> <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> equal terms for bearing arms as British citizens.|$|E
25|$|Javoršek gained {{recognition}} foremost as a playwright. His early plays, {{based on}} existential concerns, but filled with irony, playfulness and artistic {{use of language}} games, largely contributed to the modernization of the Slovene theatre in the 1950s. In his plays, he was critical towards the established <b>political</b> <b>powers</b> <b>and</b> social conformism.|$|R
25|$|The special {{relation}} of militarists {{and the central}} civil government with the Imperial Family supported the important position of the Emperor as Head of State with <b>political</b> <b>powers,</b> <b>and</b> {{the relationship with the}} nationalist right-wing movements.

5|$|The {{eldest son}} of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Edward {{was related to}} royalty {{throughout}} Europe. Before his accession to the throne, he served as heir apparent and held the title of Prince of Wales for longer {{than any of his}} predecessors. During the long reign of his mother, he was largely excluded from <b>political</b> <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties, and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes, but despite public approval his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} the first four kings was {{distinct}} {{from that of the}} last three kings. The first kings were elected. Between the reigns of the final three kings, however, the monarchy became hereditary, and as such, the senate became subordinated to the king. This breach in the senate's sovereignty, rather than an intolerable tyranny, was probably what led the Patricians in the senate to overthrow the last king. The king may have sought the support of the Plebeians; however, the Plebeians were no doubt exhausted from their continued military service, and from their forced labor in the construction of public works. They were probably also embittered by their lack of <b>political</b> <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> therefore did not come to the aide of either the king or the senate.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of Antony at the Battle of Actium in 31BC, Octavian {{consolidated}} his <b>political</b> <b>power</b> <b>and</b> in 27BC was named Augustus by the Roman Senate, becoming the first Roman emperor. Around this time, Tiridates II of Parthia briefly overthrew Phraates IV, {{who was able to}} quickly reestablish his rule with the aid of Scythian nomads. Tiridates fled to the Romans, taking one of Phraates' sons with him. In negotiations conducted in 20BC, Phraates arranged for the release of his kidnapped son. In return, the Romans received the lost legionary standards taken at Carrhae in 53BC, as well as any surviving prisoners of war. The Parthians viewed this exchange as {{a small price to pay}} to regain the prince. Augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over Parthia; this propaganda was celebrated in the minting of new coins, the building of a new temple to house the standards, and even in fine art such as the breastplate scene on his statue Augustus of Prima Porta.|$|E
2500|$|The State of Kerala {{came into}} {{existence}} on 1 November 1956, with a Governor appointed by the President of India {{as the head of}} the State instead of the King.

5|$|He {{sought to}} {{concentrate}} <b>political</b> <b>power,</b> <b>and</b> the emergency superpowers law giving discretionary powers {{to the president}} to change the national budget was periodically renewed. The Front for Victory (conceived as a lema of the PJ) became a political alliance of the PJ, pro-Kirchner factions in other parties, and minor left-wing parties. The progressivist population, lacking leadership since the crisis which discredited the UCR, also supported the new coalition. Most Peronists simply defected to the new party, {{and the end of}} the economic crisis and the discretionary control of state finances allowed Kirchner to discipline his allies and co-opt his rivals. As a consequence, the Congress became compliant and the opposition was unable to present a credible alternative to the government. In addition to concentrating power, Kirchner micromanaged most government tasks or assigned them to trusted aides regardless of cabinet hierarchy. He managed relations with the United States and Brazil, leaving relations with Bolivia and Venezuela in the hands of Minister of Federal Planning Julio de Vido. There were no cabinet meetings during Kirchner's presidency, rare in a national government; this may have been influenced by his governance of Santa Cruz, a sparsely-populated province in which the cabinet was of little use and decisions were primarily made by the governor.|$|E
5|$|When John's {{elder brother}} Richard became king in September 1189, {{he had already}} {{declared}} his intention of joining the Third Crusade. Richard set about raising the huge sums of money required for this expedition through the sale of lands, titles and appointments, and attempted to ensure {{that he would not}} face a revolt while away from his empire. John was made Count of Mortain, was married to the wealthy Isabel of Gloucester, and was given valuable lands in Lancaster and the counties of Cornwall, Derby, Devon, Dorset, Nottingham and Somerset, all with the aim of buying his loyalty to Richard whilst the king was on crusade. Richard retained royal control of key castles in these counties, thereby preventing John from accumulating too much military and <b>political</b> <b>power,</b> <b>and,</b> for the time being, the king named the four-year-old Arthur of Brittany as the heir to the throne. In return, John promised not to visit England for the next three years, thereby in theory giving Richard adequate time to conduct a successful crusade and return from the Levant without fear of John seizing power. Richard left political authority in England – the post of justiciar – jointly in the hands of Bishop Hugh de Puiset and William Mandeville, and made William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, his chancellor. Mandeville immediately died, and Longchamp took over as joint justiciar with Puiset, which would prove a less than satisfactory partnership. Eleanor, the queen mother, convinced Richard to allow John into England in his absence.|$|E

Like the church, the landed aristocracy felt threatened by O'Higgins, resenting his attempts to eliminate noble titles and, more important, to eliminate entailed estates.|$|R
