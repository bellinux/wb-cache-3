5|$|On {{the morning}} of the fifth day, the Pokémon News Flash reports on a {{breaking}} news story: a disc containing the unaired fifth episode of Pichu Bros. was dropped and lost by the delivery Magnemite {{on their way to the}} show's broadcasting studio. After obtaining a lamp from a friendly Duskull in the front lawn, the player takes a bus back to Mt. Snowfall, where the disc was presumed lost. Eastward are the Ruins of Truth, where the stubborn Ghost-type Pokémon Gengar blocks the player's path until it is scared away by the lamp. Inside the Ruins, Pikachu gets stuck inside a statue of the bat-like Pokémon Golbat. Upon being shaken free, the missing disc <b>pops</b> <b>out.</b> The player hands it back to Magnemite, who is waiting sheepishly outside, and heads home to watch the last episode, along with a video called Meowth's Party.|$|E
5|$|The opening segment {{had many}} parodies and {{references}} to films. When the segment opens, the Simpson family is {{dressed up for}} Halloween. Here Maggie <b>pops</b> <b>out</b> of Bart's astronaut suit, dressed as a baby alien, which is {{a reference to the}} 1979 film Alien. Homer is dressed as Doctor Manhattan from the 2009 superhero film Watchmen. During the middle, there is a spoof of the 1960 film Psycho, as the same music and similar scenes are used (E.G: Reverend Lovejoy eyeing Homer in his car. In the end of the segment, it turns into a spoof of the 2010 film 127 Hours, in which Ralston loses his arm after being trapped under a rock. Ralston voiced the 911 dispatcher Homer calls when he is trapped.|$|E
25|$|Takahashi {{collaborated with}} Yoshio Sawai by drawing {{a picture of}} Dark Yugi for Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, where he <b>pops</b> <b>out</b> of Bobobo's afro at one point. In return, Takahashi {{included}} the nu handkerchief in a panel of the thirty-fourth volume of Yu-Gi-Oh!.|$|E

25|$|Martha taunts George aggressively, and he retaliates {{with his}} usual passive aggression. Martha tells an {{embarrassing}} story about how she humiliated him with a sucker-punch {{in front of her}} father. During the telling, George appears with a gun and fires at Martha, but an umbrella <b>pops</b> <b>out.</b> After this scare, Martha's taunts continue, and George reacts violently by breaking a bottle. Nick and Honey become increasingly unsettled and, {{at the end of the}} act, Honey runs to the bathroom to vomit, because she had too much to drink.|$|E

She agreed. In the end Carmen said that the party had fun moments {{but it was not a}} success.|$|R
500|$|In 2002, [...] Industries {{obtained}} a patent for an underwire design {{that includes a}} spring-loaded plastic cushion tip on one or both ends. The spring is designed to keep the wire from poking through the bra. In 2008, Scott Dutton of Wales invented the [...] "Bra Angel", a simple device to repair a bra when the underwire <b>pops</b> <b>out</b> of its channel. It is a barbed plastic cap that fits onto {{the end of the}} underwire, which is then inserted back into the bra and held in place by the barbs.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} Cruise enters the closet is {{referenced}} in the South Park {{segment of the}} opening of the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards on August 27, 2006, in which Conan O'Brien is {{trying to get to the}} show, but suddenly appears in Stan's room in an animated form. Stan begins yelling at him as he runs into the nearby closet. Immediately following the entrance, he exits the closet and says, [...] "There's someone else in there", referring to Cruise, and leaves the door open. Cruise then <b>pops</b> <b>out</b> and closes the door.|$|E
500|$|Various {{species of}} Taenia infest {{the guts of}} humans, cats and dogs. The juveniles use herbivores – for example pigs, cattle and rabbits – as {{intermediate}} hosts. Excreted proglottids release eggs that stick to grass leaves and hatch after being swallowed by a herbivore. The larva makes {{its way to the}} herbivore's muscles and metamorphoses into an oval worm about [...] long, with a scolex that is kept inside. When the definitive host eats infested and raw or undercooked meat from an intermediate host, the worm's scolex <b>pops</b> <b>out</b> and attaches itself to the gut, and the adult tapeworm develops.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the nature of}} face perception, several studies used the visual search paradigm, whereby subjects detect an odd target among distractors. When detection reaction time is set-size independent, the odd element is said to “pop out”, reflecting a basic mechanism or map for the relevant feature. A number of previous studies suggested that schematic faces do not <b>pop</b> <b>out.</b> We show that natural face stimuli do <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> among assorted non-face objects. Animal faces, on the other hand, do not <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> from among the same assorted non-face objects. In addition, search for a face among distractors of another object category is easier than the reverse search, and face search is mediated by holistic face characteristics, rather than by face parts. Our {{results indicate that the}} association of <b>pop</b> <b>out</b> with elementary features and lower cortical areas may be incorrect. Instead, face search, and indeed all feature search, may reflect high-level activity with generalization over spatial and other property details...|$|R

500|$|Bungee {{launching}} {{was widely}} used {{in the early days}} of gliding, and occasionally gliders are still launched from the top of a gently sloping hill into a strong breeze using a substantial multi-stranded rubber band, or [...] "bungee". For this launch method, the glider's main wheel rests in a small concrete trough. The hook normally used for winch-launching is instead attached to the middle of the bungee. Each end is then pulled by three or four people. One group runs slightly to the left, the other to the right. Once the tension in the bungee is high enough, the glider is released and the glider's wheel <b>pops</b> <b>out</b> of the trough. The glider gains just enough energy to leave the ground and fly away from the hill.|$|E
500|$|Although Comedy Central did {{not object}} to most aspects of the episode, they did require some edits to {{material}} they deemed potentially offensive. During rehearsal for a Nativity play, a baby Jesus resembling a fetus <b>pops</b> <b>out</b> of Wendy, who is playing the Virgin Mary, and is caught by Kyle, who is portraying Joseph of Nazareth. Although the scene was ultimately kept in the episode, Comedy Central executives had problems with it and Parker said they had to handle its animation [...] "very carefully". Additionally, during filming of the live-action Mr. Hankey commercial, the baby originally held the Mr. Hankey stool and took {{a bite out of}} it. Comedy Central officials would not allow the scene in the episode and it was changed to portray the idea that the baby had already eaten the stool off-camera, which Parker said he felt was actually funnier.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{exterior}} {{scenes were}} shot in Vancouver, Canada's Chinatown while the crematorium scenes were shot on a soundstage. Interior {{shots of the}} gambling parlor were shot at the Welsh Irish Scottish English (W.I.S.E.) Hall, a community building in Vancouver. The production staff created a second balcony in the hall exclusively for the episode, with an agreement to tear it down once the episode was filmed. However, after the filming ended, the W.I.S.E. Hall's owners requested that the balcony be left in place [...] "for aesthetic reasons". The vase and tiles used in the episode were created entirely by the show's production department. The scene where a frog <b>pops</b> <b>out</b> of a victim's chest was created by using molds to create a fake human torso, which was then placed over the actor. For a close-up shot, the torso was placed on {{a table with a}} hole on it, allowing the show's animal wrangler to push a live frog through the opening in the torso. Actors Michael Yama and Lucy Liu had to redo all of their dialogue in a Cantonese accent in post production. Their re-recorded lines were dubbed over the original soundtrack.|$|E

2500|$|The main character, a nameless {{citizen of}} Enoch, starts {{the game in}} a {{beautiful}} garden where everything seems fine.

2500|$|Los Angeles Times {{film critic}} Michael Wilmington felt that Darkman {{was the only}} film at the time [...] "that {{successfully}} captures the graphic look, rhythm and style of the superhero books." [...] Terrence Rafferty of The New Yorker said, [...] "Raimi works from inside the cheerfully violent adolescent-male sensibility of superhero comics, {{as if there were}} no higher style for a filmmaker to aspire to, and the absence of condescension is refreshing." [...] USA Today gave the film three out of four stars. However, Richard Corliss in Time said that Raimi was not [...] "effective with actors" [...] and Peoples Ralph Novak called Darkman, a [...] "loud, sadistic, stupidly written, wretchedly acted film." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "The movie is full of jaunty, Grand Guignol touches (the main gangster enjoys snapping and collecting fingers), but Raimi's images also have a spectral, kinetic beauty." [...] In his review for the Washington Post, Joe Brown wrote, [...] "Though Raimi seems to be trying to restrain himself, his giddily sick sense of humor still <b>pops</b> <b>out</b> all over the place – Darkman is a frenetic funhouse ride that has you laughing and screaming at the same time." ...|$|E
