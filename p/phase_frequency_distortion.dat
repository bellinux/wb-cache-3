When these methods {{are applied to}} the linear equation: y″ + ω 2 y = 0, ω > 0, we determine the parameters α, β so that the <b>phase</b> lag (<b>frequency</b> <b>distortion)</b> of the method is minimal. The resulting method has (algebraic) order 4 and a small <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> of size (13628800) v 8 (v = ωh, h being the step size) and in addition it possesses an interval of periodicity of size 4. 63, which {{is larger than the}} interval of periodicity corresponding to the explicit method of Chawla and Rao (1986).

The human ear is largely insensitive to phase distortion, though it is exquisitely sensitive to relative phase relationships within heard sounds.

40|$|Increased {{expression}} of choline kinase has frequently {{been shown in}} tumours and {{is thought to be}} associated with disease progression. Studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy have shown an increase in total choline-containing metabolites (tCho) in tumour compared with healthy tissue. Subsequent reductions in tCho following successful treatment support the use of tCho as a biomarker of disease and response. However, accurate measurement of tCho using MRS in abdominal tumours is complicated by respiratory motion, blurring the acquisition volume and degrading the lineshape and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of metabolites. Motion compensation using prospectively gated acquisitions or offline correction of <b>phase</b> and <b>frequency</b> <b>distortions</b> can help restore the SNR and linewidth of metabolites. Prospectively gated acquisitions have the advantage of confining the volume of acquisition to the prescribed volume but are constrained by the repetition time (TR) of the respiratory motion. In contrast, data acquired for offline correction may use a shorter repetition time and therefore yield an increased SNR per unit time. In this study abdominal spectra acquired from single-voxel ‘free-breathing’ measurements in liver of healthy volunteers and in abdominal tumours of cancer patients were compared with those of prospective gating and with an implementation of offline correction. The two motion compensation methodologies were assessed in terms of SNR, linewidth and repeatability. Our experiments show that prospective gating and offline correction result in a 12 – 22...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We model a {{degraded}} {{image as}} an original image {{that has been}} subject to linear <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> and additive noise injection. Since the psychovisual effects of <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> and noise injection are independent, we decouple these two sources of degradation and measure their effect on the human visual system. We develop a distortion measure (DM) {{of the effect of}} <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion,</b> and a noise quality measure (NQM) of the effect of additive noise. The NQM, which is based on Peli’s contrast pyramid, takes into account the following: 1) variation in contrast sensitivity with distance, image dimensions, and spatial frequency; 2) variation in the local luminance mean; 3) contrast interaction between spatial frequencies; 4) contrast masking effects. For additive noise, we demonstrate that the nonlinear NQM is a better measure of visual quality than peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and linear quality measures. We compute the DM in three steps. First, we find the <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> in the degraded image. Second, we compute the deviation of this <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> from an allpass response of unity gain (no distortion). Finally, we weight the deviation by a model of the frequency response of the human visual system and integrate over the visible frequencies. We demonstrate how to decouple distortion and additive noise degradation in a practical image restoration system. Index Terms—Computational vision, human visual system modeling, image quality.

40|$|Adaptive optics is {{concerned}} with the correction of phase distortions in wavefronts which degrade the quality of images produced by optical systems. It was originally developed for both astronomy and the military, where the Earth's atmosphere causes distortions, although other uses are now being developed. As ground based telescopes become increasingly large the size and complexity of adaptive optics systems also increase, creating "extreme adaptive optics”. This thesis deals with such an adaptive optics system. A novel self referenced phase shifting interferometer based on a liquid crystal (LC) waveplate is presented which can measure high spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>phase</b> <b>distortions.</b> This is then coupled to a LC spatial light modulator wavefront corrector. The geometry is matched such that {{there is no need for}} a wavefront reconstructor. The performance is measured in two stages. Firstly, spatially where static phase distortions are measured by the interferometer and corrected. Secondly, temporally where a simple analogue feedback is implemented to show correction over a single corrector pixel for fast time varying phase distortions. This work builds on other published research on using point diffraction interferometry in adaptive optics. The novelty lies in the development of a new implementation of a point diffraction interferometer, and in the demonstration of a high-speed closed loop single channel system. This work therefore contributes to the groundwork required to build an extreme adaptive optics system whose complexity scales linearly with the size (area) of the telescope aperture.
