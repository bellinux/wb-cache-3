40|$|In {{the course}} of re-writing my typical {{top-level}} GMOS-IFU data reduction sequence in Python for a research project, I have developed a small module that helps express the scientific process in a relatively intuitive way as a Pythonic series of operations on NDData collections, mapped to files, with existing IRAF steps integrated almost seamlessly (pending their eventual replacement). For scientific end-user purposes, this experiment aims to obviate a need for <b>pipeline</b> <b>machinery,</b> favouring simple control flow in the main script and retaining a smooth transition from high-level process description to lower-level libraries by encapsulating necessary bookeeping within the data representation and simple wrappers. The I/O abstraction should make support for file formats other than FITS (eg. ASDF) straightforward to add. This work-in-progress {{can be found at}} [URL] and I intend to split its functionality involving IRAF or instrument processing into a separate "ndprocess" module as the prototype nears completion, leaving a core "ndmapper" package, without any special dependencies, as a general add-on for nddata...|$|E

40|$|Metal casting {{enables the}} {{production}} of simple and complex parts that meet {{a wide variety of}} needs. Nearly all manufactured goods contain one or more cast components. Major end-uses include power generation equipment, defense systems and machinery, motor vehicles, transportation equipment, oil field <b>machinery,</b> <b>pipelines,</b> industrial <b>machinery,</b> construction materials, and other products vital to our economic and national security. The scope of the study is mainly made to cover the following areas:- I – Investigate the availability of materials in the Sudan for moulds construction for different metal casting processes as well as for producing parts by casting. The research showed that Sudan contains good quantities of scrap of various metal alloys beside natural resources of natural metals like iron and copper. II – Investigate the situation of metal casting Industry in the Sudan and the techniques adopted to the current activities. The survey work made on this area showed that the quality of the products is very poor because the industry of metal casting is lacking the following requirements:- i – Adoption of Scientific techniques. ii – Skilled labour. iii – Specialized engineers. iv – Proper equipment and tools. Due to the above reasons metal casting does not play any role in the plan of the development of Sudan. The adoption of the correct techniques will make the industry able to reduce its cost of production to become competitive with other manufacturing methods. Also energy content can be reduced by improving product quality-thereby reducing scrap and melting requirements. III – The research exerted great emphasis to put the foundry equipment of the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture (U of K) in good operational conditions to realize the three metal casting processes, sand casting, die casting and centrifugal casting can be performed...|$|R
40|$|The {{pipeline}} processor {{is a common}} paradigm for very high speed computing <b>machinery.</b> <b>Pipeline</b> processors provide high speed because their separate stages can operate concurrently, much as different people on a manufacturing assembly line work concurrently on material passing down the line. Although the concurrency of {{pipeline processor}}s makes their design a demanding task, they {{can be found in}} graphics processors, in signal processing devices, in integrated circuit components for doing arithmetic, and in the instruction interpretation units and arithmetic operations of general purpose computing machinery. Because I plan to describe a variety of pipeline processors, I will start by suggesting names for their various forms. Pipeline processors, or more simply jus...|$|R
40|$|When {{multifunctional}} <b>pipeline</b> repair <b>machinery</b> (MPRM) {{is used in}} {{the deep}} sea area, it is difficult to grip the pipeline and ensure concentricity between the cutter heads and the pipeline during its operation. In view of this, a new system of two-arm holding self-centering pipeline clamping device was proposed. The system is composed of two groups of parallelogram double-rocker mechanism and cranking block mechanism which are symmetrically distributed on the frame. The geometric parameter solutions of the clamping device were analyzed with motion and transmission as the constraints. A mechanical model was established to associate the friction torque of clamping points with the driving force. Clamping device and machinery were designed and manufactured for the Ø 304. 8 – 457. 2  mm pipelines used in this test. ADAMS simulation experiments were conducted underwater, and the cutting and beveling tests were carried out onshore. The following results are achieved. First, the smaller the pipe diameter, the smaller the transmission angle of the oscillating slider mechanism; the longer the hydraulic cylinder stroke, the greater the transmission angle of the double rocker mechanism. Second, the driving force of the clamping device increases with the increase of the pipe diameter. When the diameter reaches 457. 2  mm, the hydraulic cylinder driving force of the clamping device should be greater than 10219  N. Third, the feed rate of the cutters increases suddenly due to the slight shaking of the machinery which occurs {{at the beginning of the}} pipe cutting, so it is necessary to adopt a small feed rate. And fourth, onshore experiment results agree well with the theoretical design and simulation results, proving the rationality of the system. The research results in this paper provide technical basis for the research and development of similar engineering prototypes...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological and Agricultural EngineeringWenqiao YuanGasification is an {{efficient}} way to produce energy from biomass, which has significant positive impacts on the environment, domestic economy, national energy security, and the society in general. In this study, a lab-scale updraft biomass gasifier was designed, built, and instrumented for stable gasification using low-bulk density biomass. Related accessories, such as a biomass feeder, inlet air temperature controller, air injection nozzle, and tar cracking system, were also developed to enhance gasifier performance. The effect of operation parameters on gasifier performance was studied. Two operational parameters, including air flow rate and feed-air temperature, were studied on three sources of biomass: prairie hay, sorghum biomass, and wood chips. Results showed that higher air flow rate increased tar contents in syngas for all three types. It was also found that different biomasses gave significantly different tar contents, in the order of wood chips>sorghum biomass>prairie hay. Feed-air temperature did not {{have a significant effect on}} tar content in syngas except for prairie hay, where higher feed air temperature reduced tar. A statistical model was implemented to study differences on syngas composition. Results showed that different biomasses produced syngas with different high heating value, e. g., wood chips > prairie hay > sorghum biomass. CO composition also showed differences by feed air temperature and biomass, e. g. prairie hay>wood chips>sorghum biomass, but H[subscript] 2 did not show significant differences by either biomass type or operating conditions. Moreover, because of the downstream problems caused by tars in syngas such as tar condensation in <b>pipelines,</b> blockage and <b>machinery</b> collapse, an in-situ tar cracking system was developed to remove tars in syngas. The tar cracking device was built in the middle of the gasifier’s combustion using gasification heat to drive the reactions. The in-situ system was found to be very effective in tar removal and syngas enhancement. The highest tar removal of 95 % was achieved at 0. 3 s residence time and 10 % nickel loading. This condition also gave the highest syngas HHV increment of 36 % (7. 33 MJ/m[superscript] 3). The effect of gas residence time and Ni loading on tar removal and syngas composition was also studied. Gas residence of 0. 2 - 0. 3 s and Ni loading of 10 % were found appropriate in this study...|$|R
