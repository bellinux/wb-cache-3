In response, Spanish premier Mariano Rajoy said that the state might [...] "use any available judicial and <b>political</b> <b>mechanism</b> contained in the constitution and in the laws to defend the sovereignty of the Spanish people and of the general interest of Spain", a hint that he would not stop at military intervention. Following prolonged negotiations between Junts pel Sí and the CUP, Mas was replaced as president by Carles Puigdemont in January 2016. Puigdemont, on taking the oath of office, omitted the oath of loyalty to the king and the Spanish constitution, the first Catalan president to do so.|$|E
2500|$|For Grenville, {{the first}} issue was {{the amount of the}} tax. [...] Soon after his {{announcement}} of the possibility of a tax, he had told American agents that he was not opposed to the Americans suggesting an alternative way of raising the money themselves. However, the only other alternative would be to requisition each colony and allow them to determine how to raise their share. [...] This had never worked before, even during the French and Indian War, and there was no <b>political</b> <b>mechanism</b> in place that would have ensured the success of such cooperation. On February 2, 1765, Grenville met to discuss the tax with Benjamin Franklin, Jared Ingersoll from New Haven, Richard Jackson, agent for Connecticut, and Charles Garth, the agent for South Carolina (Jackson and Garth were also members of Parliament). [...] These colonial representatives had no specific alternative to present; they simply suggested that the determination be left to the colonies. [...] Grenville replied that he wanted to raise the money [...] "by means the most easy and least objectionable to the Colonies". Thomas Whately had drafted the Stamp Act, and he said that the delay in implementation had been [...] "out of Tenderness to the colonies", and that the tax was judged as [...] "the easiest, the most equal and the most certain." ...|$|E
60|$|What {{that system}} is {{it would take}} far more space than {{we can afford to}} sketch even in outline. All we can do is to enumerate some of its main positions. They are to be drawn not only from the Positive Polity, but from two other works,--the Positivist Catechism: a Summary Exposition of the Universal Religion, in Twelve Dialogues between a Woman and a Priest of Humanity; and second, The Subjective Synthesis (1856), which is the first and only volume of a work upon {{mathematics}} announced {{at the end of the}} Positive Philosophy. The system for which the Positive Philosophy is alleged to have been the scientific preparation contains a Polity and a Religion; a complete arrangement of life in all its aspects, giving a wider sphere to Intellect, Energy, and Feeling than could be found in any of the previous organic types,--Greek, Roman, or Catholic-feudal. Comte's immense superiority over such præ-Revolutionary Utopians as the Abbé Saint Pierre, no less than over the group of post-revolutionary Utopians, is especially visible in his firm grasp of the cardinal truth that the improvement of the social organism can only be effected by a moral development, and never by any changes in mere <b>political</b> <b>mechanism,</b> or any violences in the way of an artificial redistribution of wealth. A moral transformation must precede any real advance. The aim, both in public and private life, is to secure to the utmost possible extent the victory of the social feeling over self-love, or Altruism over Egoism. This is the key to the regeneration of social existence, as it is the key to that unity of individual life which makes all our energies converge freely and without wasteful friction towards a common end. What are the instruments for securing the preponderance of Altruism? Clearly they must work from the strongest element in human nature, and this element is Feeling or the Heart. Under the Catholic system the supremacy of Feeling was abused, and the intellect was made its slave. Then followed a revolt of Intellect against Sentiment. The business of the new system will be to bring back the Intellect into a condition, not of slavery, but of willing ministry to the Feelings. The subordination never was, and never will be, effected except by means of a religion, and a religion, to be final, must include a harmonious synthesis of all our conceptions of the external order of the universe. The characteristic basis of a religion is the existence of a Power without us, so superior to ourselves as to command the complete submission of our whole life. This basis is to be found in the Positive stage, in Humanity, past, present, and to come, conceived as the Great Being.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} various <b>political</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and the variation in unemployment compensation programs (i. e., compulsory, voluntary, and assistance programs).

Using a multinomial logit analysis of 13 European countries from 1880 to 1945, I find that among other <b>political</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> franchise extension had the greatest impact on the likelihood of instituting unemployment compensation, controlling socio-economic factors. Greater enfranchisement is associated with a higher probability of choosing a compulsory program, but not a voluntary one. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to separating church and state, the new charter, {{which did not}} become effective until 1919, introduced substantial changes in {{the powers of the}} presidency. The executive power consisted of the president, who controlled foreign relations, national security, and agriculture, and the National Council of Administration (Consejo Nacional de Administración), or colegiado, which administered all other executive governmental functions (industrial relations, health, public works, industry and labor, livestock and agriculture, education, and the preparation of the budget). The colegiado, embodying the <b>political</b> <b>mechanism</b> of coparticipation, consisted of nine members: six from the majority party and three from the minority party. The first colegiado (1919-33) was thereby established without eliminating the office of president.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} the Vietnamese economy {{experienced}} crisis, making a more liberal, market-based economy {{more of a}} sensible option to many politicians. This led to Linh's being re-instated in the Politburo in 1985 (and Permanent Secretariat 1986), {{under the direction of}} General Secretary Trường Chinh draft political report and even being made party general secretary the following year. Immediately, he started reforming Vietnam's economy. He was elected General Secretary {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the 6th National Congress. Renouncing the ideological decisions that he claimed had caused the problems, he allowed private enterprise and market prices and disbanded agricultural collectives. This change in policy was dubbed Doi Moi, a Vietnamese term meaning renovation. In the political sphere, Linh tried to improve relations with both the United States and China. In 1990, he secretly visited China, becoming the first Vietnamese leader to do so since the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War. In 1989, he ordered the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, where they had been sent to remove Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge regime. However, as far as domestic policy is concerned, Linh felt there was little need for change. [...] "It is not objectively necessary to establish a <b>political</b> <b>mechanism</b> of pluralism and multiparty government," [...] he stated, while always referring to Western-style democratic systems as [...] "demagogic bourgeois democracies". He criticised the old communist policies, blaming them on corrupt leaders. Thus, Linh's policies were the constant target of criticism from the more conservative elements in the Communist Party. Linh stepped down as party leader in 1991 at the 7th National Congress, having announced his withdrawal a year before. His poor health was cited as the cause, as he had been hospitalised for what is suspected to have been a stroke in 1989, but political rivalries probably also played into his decision. He was succeeded by Đỗ Mười, a supporter of Linh's reforms.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how organisations' use <b>political</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and carbon accounting in the ETS policy process {{to reduce their}} carbon-related costs. It uses insights from transactional cost economics and capture theory to analyse seventy submissions made by four key industries. Instead of internalising carbon-related costs and being responsible for their emissions, organisations sought to externalise their carbon costs using political means. By participating in ETS policy processes, organisations lobbied Government to reduce their carbon-related costs, or gain opportunities for rent-seeking and income enhancement. Carbon accounting is used extensively by trade-exposed and emissions-intensive organisations to strengthen their case. The ability {{to do this is}} governed by an organisations capacity to capture policy processes; that capture depending on whether they support the Government of the day. These results will help practitioners and policy-makers understand the <b>political</b> <b>mechanisms</b> adopted within policy processes and the effectiveness of policy in triggering organisational behavioural change...|$|R

This study addresses the causes of the tendency of centralization in Turkish political system because centralized <b>political</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are the main obstacles to solve many problems such as actual and structural ones. Certainly, individuals should be treated as necessary agents in modern politics. Therefore, the place of individuals in a political system has a vital importance.

40|$|Decentralization {{throughout}} {{the developing world}} raises questions about how local political processes affect the provision of local public goods.

Villages were randomly assigned one of two <b>political</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for choosing projects, either a representative meeting-based mechanism or a direct election-based mechanism. I find that the election-based mechanism resulted in dramatically higher satisfaction, increased knowledge about the project chosen, greater perceived benefits from the project, and higher reported willingness among villagers to contribute supplementary funds and labor to the project. The <b>political</b> <b>mechanisms</b> used had much smaller effects on the actual types and locations of project chosen, with some evidence that direct elections resulted in projects located in poorer, but less isolated, areas of villages. The results show that direct participation in political decision making can substantially increase legitimacy, even if it has relatively little effect on the ultimate decisions taken...|$|R
