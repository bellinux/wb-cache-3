5000|$|The scalar {{approach}} defines {{flux density}} as a scalar-valued {{function of a}} direction and sense in space prescribed by the investigator at a point prescribed by the investigator. Sometimes this approach is indicated {{by the use of}} the term 'hemispheric flux'. For example, an investigator of thermal radiation, emitted from the material substance of the atmosphere, received at the surface of the earth, is interested in the vertical direction, and the downward sense in that direction. This investigator thinks of a unit area in a horizontal plane, surrounding the prescribed point. The investigator wants to know the total power of all the radiation from the atmosphere above in every direction, propagating with a downward sense, received by that unit area. For the flux density scalar for the prescribed direction and sense, we may writewhere with the notation above, [...] indicates that the integration extends only over the solid angles of the relevant hemisphere, and [...] denotes the angle between [...] and the prescribed direction. The term [...] is needed on account of Lambert's law. Mathematically, the quantity [...] is not a vector because it is a positive scalar-valued function of the prescribed direction and sense, in this example, of the downward vertical. In this example, when the collected radiation is propagating in the downward sense, the detector is said to be [...] "looking upwards". The measurement can be made directly with an instrument (such as a <b>pyrgeometer)</b> that collects the measured radiation all at once from all the directions of the imaginary hemisphere; in this case, Lambert-cosine-weighted integration of the spectral radiance (or specific intensity) is not performed mathematically after the measurement; the Lambert-cosine-weighted integration has been performed by the physical process of measurement itself.|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of <b>pyrgeometer,</b> which uses {{modulation}} of the atmospheric radiation by a mechanical chopper has built {{for the use of}} ground based and airborne measurement of broadband infrared atmospheric irradiances. The instrument basically consists of two radiometers - a target radiometer and a reference radiometer - using a specially developed chopper. The reference radiometer is used to measure the radiation of the chopper which has to be known additionally to calculate the atmospheric radiation from the signal of the target radiometer. The radiometer equations take into account the non-flat spectral response. A spectral correction factor is introduced to describe the relation between the weighted irradiance at the detector and the irradiance coming from the source. One important advantage of the chopped <b>pyrgeometer</b> is its nonsensitivity to the temperature distribution inside the instrument as well as its fast response. The chopped <b>pyrgeometer</b> has been used during a number of airborne missions. During the Pre-EUCREX Intercomparison Campaign flown in January 1992, two Eppley pyrgeometers, two pyrgeometers of the Foot-type and a chopped <b>pyrgeometer</b> were flown besides other instruments on three aircraft. During a rectangular flight pattern (box) the absolute irradiance values measured by the five instruments differ by about #+-# 10 % from the average value (#approx# 85 W/m" 2) of all instruments, the chopped <b>pyrgeometer</b> indicating the smallest values throughout. Since a detailed error budget of all instruments was not available, special emphasis was placed on relative quantities (ratios) to describe the trends measured by the various instruments along the flight tracks. It has been found, that the measurements of the chopped <b>pyrgeometer</b> show a much better correlation to the measurement of the Foot pyrgeometers, than to the Eppley instruments.

40|$|A {{description}} of the radiative properties of two cirrus clouds sampled on 10 / 28 / 88 in the FIRE cirrus IFO is presented. The clouds are characterized {{in terms of the}} broadband infrared effective emittance, cloud fractional absorptance, shortwave heating rate, cloud albedo and vertical velocity. The broadband fluxes used in these calculations were obtained from measurements made by pyranometers and <b>pyrgeometers.</b> The shortwave irradiances were corrected to a horizontal plane and normalized to the same time by taking into account Sabreliner flight information (i. e., pitch, roll, heading and angle of attack), as well as sun-earth geometry considerations. Since only one aircraft was used, broadband fluxes at different levels in the cloud were not measured simultaneously. As a result, sampling errors may occur due to the nonsteady state of the cloud field or due to the possibility that the flight legs were not flown directly above or below each other.

40|$|Broadband {{solar and}} {{terrestrial}} irradiance measurements of high temporal resolution {{are needed to}} study inhomogeneous clouds or surfaces and to derive vertical profiles of heating/cooling rates at cloud top. An efficient method to enhance the temporal resolution of slow-response measurements of broadband terrestrial irradiance using <b>pyrgeometer</b> is introduced. It {{is based on the}} deconvolution theorem of Fourier transform to restore amplitude and phase shift of high frequent fluctuations. It is shown that the quality of reconstruction depends on the instrument noise, the <b>pyrgeometer</b> response time and the frequency of the oscillations. The method is tested in laboratory measurements for synthetic time series including a boxcar function and periodic oscillations using a CGR- 4 <b>pyrgeometer</b> with response time of 3 s. The originally slow-response <b>pyrgeometer</b> data were reconstructed to higher resolution and compared to the predefined synthetic time series. The reconstruction of the time series worked up to oscillations of 0. 5 Hz frequency and 2 W m − 2 amplitude if the sampling frequency of the data acquisition is 16 kHz or higher. For oscillations faster than 2 Hz, the instrument noise exceeded the reduced amplitude of the oscillations in the measurements and the reconstruction failed. The method was applied to airborne measurements of upward terrestrial irradiance from the VERDI (Vertical Distribution of Ice in Arctic Clouds) field campaign. <b>Pyrgeometer</b> data above open leads in sea ice and a broken cloud field were reconstructed and compared to KT 19 infrared thermometer data. The reconstruction of amplitude and phase shift of the deconvoluted data improved the agreement with the KT 19 data. Cloud top temperatures were improved by up to 1 K above broken clouds of 80 – 800 m size (1 – 10 s flight time) while an underestimation of 2. 5 W m − 2 was found for the upward irradiance over small leads of about 600 m diameter (10 s flight time) when using the slow-response data.

The measurement site is the Skukuza airport. The operation period for 1999 is from August 16 to September 10. The main instruments include shortwave (approximately 0. 28 - 2. 8 micrometers) and longwave (approximately 4 - 50 micrometers) broadband radiometers, a shadow-band radiometer, a micro-pulse lidar, and a microwave radiometer. We also did some measurements of solar spectral flux by using an ASD spectrometer. The operation period for 2000 is from August 15 to September 22. This time we added a few new features to the SMART system: a solar tracker for direct and diffuse components of solar fluxes; the scanning capability to the microwave radiometer; a whole sky camera for documenting the sky conditions every minute; and a mini-weather station for atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction. A surface SSFR (Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer) from NASA Ames also joined us for the measurements. This is a unique data set with reasonably long observational period and high accuracy.

40|$|An {{important}} part of the Energy Balance Experiment (EBEX- 2000) was the measurement of the net radiation and its components. Since the terrain, an irrigated cotton field, could not be considered homogeneous, radiation measurements were made at nine sites using a variety of radiation instruments, including pyranometers, <b>pyrgeometers</b> and net radiometers. At several of these sites multiple instruments were employed, which enabled us to compare instruments and assess accuracies. At all sites the outgoing longwave and shortwave radiation and the net radiation were measured, while the incoming radiation was supposed to be uniformly distributed over the field and was therefore measured at three sites only. Net radiation was calculated for all sites from the sum of its four components, and compared with the direct measurement of net radiometers. The main conclusions were: (a) the outgoing shortwave radiation showed differences of up to 30 W m- 2 over the field; the differences were not clearly related to the irrigation events; (b) the outgoing longwave radiation showed differences of up to 50 W m- 2; the differences increased during the periods of irrigation; (c) the net radiation showed differences of several tens of W m- 2 across the field, rising to 50 W m- 2 or more during the periods of irrigation; (d) the net radiation is preferably to be inferred from its four components, rather than measured directly, and (e) attention should be paid to the characteristics of pyranometers that measure the outgoing radiation, and thus are mounted upside down, while they are commonly calibrated in the upward position.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of two computationally-efficient, simplified radiation codes employed {{to evaluate the}} components of the budget of terrestrial radiation is assessed from comparisons with enchmarl. calculations, perforrned with higher accuracy by reference codes. A number of approximations about the longwave radiative transfer in the atmosphere was assumed in the conception ofboth simplified codes. The first one was developed at the Instituto Astronômico e Geofísico da Universidade de São Paulo (Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics, University of São Paulo (IAG-USP; São Paulo, SP); it provides irradiances throughout the atmosphere from radiances integrated over the whole terrestrial spectrum and previously computed by running the version 7 of the Low Resolution Transmittance radiative transfer code (LOWTRAN - 7). The second simplified code under consideration is included in the general circulation model developed at the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA; USA), which runs at the Centro de Previsão do Tempo e Estudos Climáticos (CPTEC; Cachoeira Paulista, SP) for numerical weather forecasting and climate studies. Benchmark calculations employed in this study were obtained by other groups through carefulline-by-line spectral integration under hypothetical atmospheric conditions, prescribed in the scope of the program Intercomparison of Radiative Codes used in Climate Models (ICRCCM). Only the effects due to the emission I absorption by water vapor, carbon dioxide and ozone are analyzed. The effects due to the carhon dioxide are well reproduced by the code CPTEC/COLA and, excepting relatively cold atmospheric conditions, by the code developed at IAG-USP. The effects due to the ozone are underestimated by hoth simplified codes but mainly by the CPTEC/COLA, Doce the ozone bands situated outside the region 980 - 1100 cm. 1 were neglected in its development. Sensitivity tests conceming the water vapor continuum absorption indicare that its both components ("self', related to the water vapor partial pressure, and "foreign", related to the dry air pressure) must be considered in order to obtain reliable water vapor absorption estimares. Under hypothetical atmospheric conditions and assuming the occurrence of the three maio molecular absorbers, downward longwave irradiances at the surface can be systematically underestimated by the code CPTEC/COLA.
