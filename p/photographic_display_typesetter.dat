40|$|Subjects {{were asked}} to match faces {{presented}} singly on a television display with one of 35 faces presented on a <b>photographic</b> <b>display.</b> The probability of correct recognition and {{the time required to}} recognize the single face were related to the qwlity of the television image. Image quality was varied by changing the square-wave response of the television system and the video signal-to-noise voltage ratio. A derived unitary metric of image quality, the square-wave modulation transfer function area, hfTFAsQ, was shown to correlate highly with both measures of observer performance. The utility of this metric for systems design is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{information}} storage and delivery system {{was based upon}} GPT4190 computers coupled to dial in modem for public to access and via microwave link to a UHF TV Transmitter fitted with full field teletext inserters.

40|$|The article proposes {{an overall}} {{interpretation}} of Michele Mari’s Leggenda privata (2017) {{in the light}} of its photo-textual form. In particular, the author focuses on the unique position of Leggenda privata within Mari’s oeuvre and explores the function of its <b>photographic</b> <b>display</b> with respect to the autobiographical matter and the fictional frame of the narrative. A close analysis of the different ways in which the photographs interact with the text allows the author to question the merely documentary function of these images, suggesting their power to multiply narrative layers and perspectives, as well as to bring the distinctive outrance of Mari’s writing into new territory...|$|R
50|$|The {{permanent}} exhibition {{presents the}} history of Polish Underground State and Home Army in their complexity.

40|$|This essay {{critically}} {{examines the}} implications of digital media for the remembrance of the Holocaust in contemporary museum spaces, a development that has seen fundamental shifts in thinking around agency, education and entertainment. Expanding existing discussions of this issue into the Australian context, the essay takes as its central case study the design and integration of interactive StoryPod screen media in Melbourne’s Jewish Holocaust Centre. Addressing both the limitations and potentialities of interactive digital technologies for facilitating visitor-viewers’ engagement with survivor stories, the analysis highlights that digital media {{can be used to}} complement and enhance – rather than replace – traditional artefact and <b>photographic</b> <b>displays,</b> and will play an integral role in the Holocaust museums of the future...|$|R

In 2009, the museum expanded again with a new exhibition installed in a former storage area and a museum café which opened in a space formerly rented by the museum.
