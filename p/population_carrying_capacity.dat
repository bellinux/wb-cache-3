40|$|Ecological {{footprint}} (EF) is {{a useful}} tool for exploring human impacts on natural ecosystems and has been widely applied. Until now, an important issue on the relationship between population sustainable carrying capacity and EF trade has rarely been discussed. EF trade can have positive or negative impacts on demand and supply of resources, and often changes the ecological carrying capacity of a country, region or city. This study focused on relationships between <b>population</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and trade using the EF analysis framework. Taking Macao City as a case study, EFs from 1977 to 2004 were calculated. An ecological economic indicator, EF/US$ 1000, was used to analyse relationships between international trade of EF and carrying capacity, and a method for calculating <b>population</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> was also established to compare differences in sustainable populations in other countries. The results indicate that EF trade among countries, regions and cities can make up for shortages of domestic ecological resources and expand the <b>population</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> In terms of ecological carrying capacity, the developmental status of the population in Macao was weakly sustainable. This research is helpful for a country, region or city to adjust its style of consumption and population size towards a reasonable level of sustainability...|$|E

40|$|The global {{impact of}} an {{ever-increasing}} population-base combined with dangerously depleted natural resources highlights {{the urgent need}} for changes in human lifestyles and land-use patterns. To achieve more equitable and sustainable land use, it is imperative that populations live within the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of their natural assets in a manner more accountable to and ethically responsible for the land which sustains them. Our society’s very survival may well depend on worldwide acceptance of the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> imperative as a principle of personal, political, economic, educational and planning responsibility. This theoretically-focused research identifies, examines and compares a range of methodological approaches to <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> assessment and considers their relevance to future spatial planning. It also addresses existing gaps in current methodologies and suggests avenues for improvement. A set of eleven key criteria are employed to compare various existing <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> assessment models.

40|$|Natural catastrophes such as {{earthquakes}} can, {{in addition}} to causing loss of life, disrupt the urbanization process through the need for forced population redistribution and the modification of resource and environmental carrying capacity. The <b>population</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> (PCC) of an altered environment following an earthquake is a crucial determinant in the relocation of displaced persons. We use data adaptive methods to model {{the correlation between the}} physical environment and human population density in estimating PCC in areas affected by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Comparing actual population distributions with ideal population distributions allows for the identification of villages where population exceeds PCC, or conversely, areas where the environment can support a higher population. Such a comparison can provide the basis for a relocation plan, a critical element of post-catastrophe policy-making...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} spatial ecology {{is to understand}} how population-scale patterns emerge from individual-level birth, death, and movement processes. These processes, which depend on local landscape characteristics, vary spatially and may exhibit sharp transitions through behavioural responses to habitat edges, leading to discontinuous population densities. Such systems can be modelled using reaction–diffusion equations with interface conditions that capture local behaviour at patch boundaries. In this work we develop a novel homogenization technique to approximate the large-scale dynamics of the system. We illustrate our approach, which also generalizes to multiple species, with an example of logistic growth within a periodic environment. We find that population persistence and the large-scale <b>population</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> is influenced by patch residence times that depend on patch preference, as well as movement rates in adjacent patches. The forms of the homogenized coefficients yield key theoretical insights into how large-scale dynamics arise from the small-scale features...|$|E

40|$|Variance {{effective}} size Coalescent effective size geological, climatic {{and ecological}} processes. In this paper, we examine how such dynamic landscapes can alter mutant fixation probability {{and time to}} fixation. We consider three stochastic landscape dynamics: (i) the population is subject to repetitive bottlenecks, (ii) to the repeated alternation of fragmentation and fusion of demes with a constant <b>population</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> (iii) idemwith a variable carrying capacity. We show by deriving a variance, a coalescent and a harmonic mean population effective size, and with simulations that these landscapedynamics generate repetitive founder effectswhich counteract selection, thereby decreasing the fixation probability of an advantageous mutant but accelerate fixation when it occurs. For models (ii) and (iii), we also highlight an antagonistic ‘‘refuge effect’ ’ which can strongly delay mutant fixation. The predominance of either founder effects or refuge effects determines the time to fixation and mainly depends on the characteristic time scales of the landscape dynamics. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The {{logistic}} model for {{population growth is}} the simplest form of a differential equation which satisfies a number of ecologically realistic constraints, such as a carrying capacity (due to limited resources, for instance). When written in terms of stock biomass, this model specifies that dBt dt = rBt − rKB 2 t, where Bt is biomass in year t, r is the intrinsic rate of increase in absence of density dependence, and K is <b>population</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> (Schaefer 1954; 1957). This equation may be rewritten {{to account for the}} effects of fishing by introducing an instantaneous fishing mortality term, Ft: dBt dt = (r − Ft) Bt − rKB 2 t. By writing the term Ft as a function of catchability coefficients and effort expended by fishermen in different fisheries, Prager (1994) showed how to estimate model parameters from time series of yields and effort. These parameters can be estimated numerically using maximum likelihood, as wit...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{process of}} global rapid urbanization, {{it becomes a}} hot issue that whether urban {{ecosystems}} can sustain the high intensity of the human activities and eliminate impact that socio-economic development induced or not, therefore the evaluation of urban ecosystem carrying capacity has become a significant point of urban ecology. Currently the theory and method of urban ecological carrying capacity can be categorized into three main patterns by represented characteristics: <b>population</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> ecological footprint and relative carrying capacity. The relative carrying capacity in urban ecosystem {{can be defined as}} a potential ability, which can show the sustainable developing trend via comparison between ecological pressures and supportive ability. In this paper, an evaluation method of urban relative carrying capacity based on grey relevant degree is proposed and applied with Tongzhou district of Beijing, China as case study.

40|$|Abstract Strategies for {{environmental}} sustainability and global food security must account for dietary change. Using a biophysical simulation model we calculated human carrying capacity under ten diet scenarios. The scenarios included two reference diets based on actual consumption and eight “Healthy Diet” scenarios that complied with nutritional recommendations but varied {{in the level}} of meat content. We considered the U. S. agricultural land base and accounted for losses, processing conversions, livestock feed needs, suitability of land for crops or grazing, and land productivity. Annual per capita land requirements ranged from 0. 13 to 1. 08 ha person- 1 year- 1 across the ten diet scenarios. Carrying capacity varied from 402 to 807 million persons; 1. 3 to 2. 6 times the 2010 U. S. <b>population.</b> <b>Carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> was generally higher for scenarios with less meat and highest for the lacto-vegetarian diet. However, the carrying capacity of the vegan diet was lower than two of the healthy omnivore diet scenarios. Sensitivity analysis showed that carrying capacity estimates were highly influenced by starting assumptions about the proportion of cropland available for cultivated cropping. Population level dietary change can contribute substantially to meeting future food needs, though ongoing agricultural research and sustainable management practices are still needed to assure sufficient production levels...|$|E
40|$|Assessment of <b>population</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> {{is a key}} task in the {{reconstruction}} planning of areas struck by disasters, in which the precision of estimation is required. This study developed a decision-making model for estimating the population capacity of the involved townships and cities in the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake based on {{the assessment of the}} suitability for reconstruction of the areas. Through analysis, arable land resources were argued to be the critical constraint of population capacity in these areas. Then, the spatial differentiations of the post-quake development conditions across different regions were analyzed with respect to their natural environments, socio-economic development and quake damages. The expected levels of urbanization, family incomes and income structures, output levels of land, and the reliance of agricultural population on arable land were estimated by different regions. With these parameters, the population capacities of the involved townships and cities in three scenarios were estimated. The total population capacity of the entire areas is abundant compared with the actual post-quake population; however, the status of over-population substantially varies across space. It was suggested to put the emphasis of post-quake resettlement policy on those counties where earthquake had been the main causes of over-population. In the Full Recovery Scenario, three mountain counties were identified including Wenchuan, Beichuan and Maoxian, with a total over-population of about 100, 000 people...|$|E
40|$|Technology (i. e. tools, {{methods of}} {{cultivation}} and domestication, systems of construction and appropriation, machines) {{has increased the}} vital rates of humans, {{and is one of}} the defining features of the transition from Malthusian ecological stagnation to a potentially perpetual rising population growth. Maladaptations, on the other hand, encompass behaviours, customs and practices that decrease the vital rates of individuals. Technology and maladaptations are part of the total stock of culture carried by the individuals in a population. Here, we develop a quantitative model for the coevolution of cumulative adaptive technology and maladaptive culture in a ‘producer–scrounger’ game, which can also usefully be interpreted as an ‘individual–social’ learner interaction. Producers (individual learners) are assumed to invent new adaptations and maladaptations by trial-and-error learning, insight or deduction, and they pay the cost of innovation. Scroungers (social learners) are assumed to copy or imitate (cultural transmission) both the adaptations and maladaptations generated by producers. We show that the coevolutionary dynamics of producers and scroungers in the presence of cultural transmission can have a variety of effects on <b>population</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> From stable polymorphism, where scroungers bring an advantage to the population (increase in carrying capacity), to periodic cycling, where scroungers decrease carrying capacity, we find that selection-driven cultural innovation and transmission may send a population on the path of indefinite growth or to extinction...|$|E

In this study, a predictive model was developed to translate changes in fecundity of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) in a short-term laboratory toxicity test to alterations in population growth rate. The model uniquely combines a Leslie population projection matrix and the logistic equation. Application of the model requires only a life table for the organism of interest, a measure of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> for the given population, and an estimation {{of the effect of}} a stressor on vital rates. The model was applied to investigate population dynamics for fathead minnow exposed to the androgen receptor agonist 17 β-trenbolone. Organismal-level responses for fathead minnows exposed to varying levels of 17 β-trenbolone were used to determine projected alterations in a population existing in a small body of water containing varying concentrations of the androgen. Fathead minnow <b>populations</b> occurring at <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and subsequently exposed to 0. 027 mg/L of 17 β-trenbolone exhibited a 51 % projected decrease in average population size after 2 years of exposure. <b>Populations</b> at <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> exposed to concentrations of 17 β-trenbolone ≥ 0. 266 mg/L exhibited a 93 % projected decrease in average population size after 2 years of exposure.
