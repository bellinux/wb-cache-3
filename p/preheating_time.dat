50|$|Introduction of the magnesium-zinc-zirconium alloys, ZW2 and ZW3, {{represents}} a considerable advance in magnesium alloy technology {{for a number}} of reasons. They are high strength, but, since they do not contain aluminium, the cast billet contains only small quantities of the second phase. Since the solidus temperature is raised by about , the risk of hotshortness at relatively high extrusion speeds is much reduced. However, the mechanical properties are sensitive to billet <b>preheating</b> <b>time,</b> temperature and extrusion speed, Long preheating times and high temperatures and speeds produces properties similar to those in older aluminium-containing alloys, Heating times must be short and temperatures and speeds low to produce high properties.

According to the packaging roadmap, worldwide COB market trend would most likely expand to about 25 billion units per year by 2001 [1]. The popularity of COB is driven by its lower cost and its compatibility to the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) surface mounting process.

Experiments are performed with toluene as VOC. Several parameters are investigated both experimentally and through a mathematical model.

The concentration of the desorbed VOC as a function of time has the shape of a peak followed by a tail.

40|$|A {{hierarchy}} of interacting and interdependent approaches {{have been developed}} for calculating internal surface convective heat transfer coefficients within mechanically-ventilated rooms. A 'high-level' computer code is developed for non-bucyant and buoyant flow based on the "elliptic' code of Pun and Spalding (1977), in which 'upwind' finite-difference approximations to the governing partial-differential equations for continuity, momentum and thermal energy are formulated in terms of 'primitive' pressure-velocity variables. Closure of these time-averaged, elliptic equations is obtained via transport equations for both the turbulence kinetic energy and its dissipation rate. The high-level code solves the difference equations for a predetermined size, staggered grid in an iterative 'line-by-line' manner using a guess-and-correct procedure. An 'intermediate-level' computer code (the ROOM-CHT program) has also been developed for the above purpose, which employs 'informed" estimates of the flow and thermal field based on the known mean flow properties of wall-jets. The corresponding heat transfer distribution across the room surface is calculated using wall-jet profile analysis or improved data correlations for bucyancy-driven convection as appropriate. Caqputations are presented for a room into which air is injected through a low or high side wall register. The supply of air governed by both cyclic and modulating control was examined.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Industrial & Manufacturing Systems EngineeringShuting LeiLaser-assisted {{machining}} (LAM) is {{a promising}} non-conventional machining technique for advanced ceramics. However, the fundamental machining mechanism which governs the LAM {{process is not}} well understood so far. Hence, the main objective {{of this study is}} to explore the machining mechanism and provide guidance for future LAM operations. In this study, laser-assisted milling (LAMill) of silicon nitride ceramics is focused. Experimental experience reveals that workpiece temperature in LAM of silicon nitride ceramics determines the surface quality of the machined workpiece. Thus, in order to know the thermal features of the workpiece in LAM, the laser-silicon nitride interaction mechanism is investigated via heating experiments. The trends of temperature affected by the key parameters (laser power, laser beam diameter, feed rate, and <b>preheat</b> <b>time)</b> are obtained through a parametric study. Experimental results show that high operating temperature leads to low cutting force, good surface finish, small edge chipping, and low residual stress. The temperature range for brittle-to-ductile transition should be avoided due to the rapid increase of fracture toughness. In order to know the temperature distribution at the cutting zone in the workpiece, a transient three-dimensional thermal model is developed using finite element analysis (FEA) and validated through experiments. Heat generation associated with machining is considered and demonstrated to have little impact on LAM. The model indicates that laser power is one critical parameter for successful operation of LAM. Feed and cutting speed can indirectly affect the operating temperatures. Furthermore, a machining model is established with the distinct element method (or discrete element method, DEM) to simulate the dynamic process of LAM. In the microstructural modeling of a β-type silicon nitride ceramic, clusters are used to simulate the rod-like grains of the silicon nitride ceramic and parallel bonds act as the intergranular glass phase between grains.

The objective of this research is to investigate the accuracy of flame spread modelling in FDS 4; where the prediction of opposed flow flame spread parameters from FDS 4 were directly compared with the experimental results that were obtained experimentally. The standardised procedure for determining the material ignition and flame spread properties was followed and applied to simulate the LIFT test. The LIFT test apparatus was set up in FDS 4 with a domain size of 0. 9 x 0. 3 x 0. 3 metres in the x, y and z directions respectively. From the heat flux distribution along the calibration specimen, it indicated that calibration of the LIFT apparatus can be executed in FDS 4 where the percentage error is within 1. 2 %. This report also provides the thermal transport properties (i. e. thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity) of the tested New Zealand timber and timber based products. These were determined using a transient plane source technique and subsequently these properties were entered as the surface identifications in FDS 4. The ignition tests were not performed as part of the simulated LIFT test since a direct comparison with the results was required to give a more meaningful assessment. For this reason, the ignition parameters that were obtained from the previous experiments were employed to carry out the flame spread test. Due to the concept of a <b>preheat</b> <b>time</b> required by the standard test method and FDS 4 being not able to preheat specimens, the temperature immediately after the <b>preheat</b> <b>time</b> was calculated and implemented for the specimens. The heat transfer problem was solved using an explicit method; where specimens were divided into 11 different nodes. Different scenarios were investigated to see the effect that the selected combustion model has on modelling flame spread. The two analytical models tested were (1) thermoplastic fuels and (2) charring fuels model. Furthermore, the flame spread was visualised using either the Mixture Fraction or the HRRPUV model in Smokeview; where the rate of flame spread for each specimen was obtained. And lastly, three different absorption coefficients (0. 6, 0. 7 and 0. 8) for each specimen were examined; this parameter contributed significantly to the rate of flame spread as it determines the amount of heat flux being absorbed by the specimen during the <b>time</b> of <b>preheating.</b> A study of the grid size was also performed to investigate the accuracy of the FDS 4 simulations with the grid size selected. It has been found that increasing the size of the grid cell does not greatly affect the flame spread results. Moisture content and heat of vaporisation input variables were also examined. From the flame spread data, moisture content does not have a significant role in modelling flame spread. However, it was indicated that the heat of vaporisation has an effect on the output of the flame spread parameters. It was determined from the sensitivity analysis that the most appropriate solid boundary condition to be used in predicting the flame spread would be thermoplastic fuels model with an absorption coefficient of 0. 8. By using this scenario as the basis, the plot of the arrival time against the distance along the specimen exhibits a similar trend of flame spread with the experimental results at first, but later on, the extinction of flame front actually occurred at a much earlier stage than the experimental results showed. In general, the analyses showed that FDS 4 cannot perform the LIFT test where the prediction of flame heating parameter and minimum heat flux for spread were out by more than 20 % shown by the direct comparison between experimental results. However, the prediction of minimum heat flux required for ignition seems to agree with the experimental results where the percentage error is within 20 %...|$|R
30|$|Compared {{with the}} two <b>preheating</b> methods, the <b>time</b> when Te reached 20  °C from −[*] 10  °C with Method 1 was about 35  s less than that with Method 2. This was not great {{advantage}} for the Method 1 because this needed larger size heating films, the heat transfer surface of which were about 7.7 times more than that with Method 2 under the same heating power, which will cause more cost of BTMSs. Moreover, Method 1 increases more difficulties of maintenance than Method 2 when the cells are integrated in a package for EV applications.|$|R
