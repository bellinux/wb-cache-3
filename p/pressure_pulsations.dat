One dimensional (1 D) acoustic method, Finite Element Method (FEM) calculated impedance transfer matrix method, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are three commonly used methods to calculate these <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsations.</b> With CFD being used most often to solve this type of analysis; however CFD is often time consuming and requires significant computer resources.

This paper will use the FEM calculated impedance transfer matrix method to analyze a hermetic HVAC reciprocating compressor to show that geometry simplifications could result in poor predictions of pressure pulsation.

For pressure pulsation attenuation, different types of mufflers are applied using a design based on the Helmholtz resonator approach. This design is not effective for variable revolution speed compressors and in this case other <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsations</b> attenuation methods are required. Nowadays, due to the increasing application of variable speed compressors new design methods are developed. One of the possibilities to attenuate <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsations</b> over a wide range of frequencies is the introduction of specially shaped nozzles in the gas duct flow directly after the compressor outlet chamber. It is well known that a nozzle can attenuate <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsations,</b> however, it increases the compressor power at the same time. The main criterion for the nozzle selection is the highest possible attenuation of <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsations</b> coupled with the lowest possible effect on the compressor pumping power. In some cases 25 - 30 % of the pressure damping is good enough to reach the standard requirements. The method applying CFD impulse flow simulations has been developed for the estimation of the nozzle influence on <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsations</b> for all frequencies. The FLUENT/ANSYS software has been used for the simulation.

Finite element Random Vibration analysis is conducted on Proton WAJA 1. 6 intake manifolds designs for material cast aluminium alloy AlSi 12 and glass-fibred polyamide PA 6 GF 30. The {{purpose of this}} project is to study the computational maximum stress on the model due {{to the effect of}} engine vibrations and <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsation</b> loads. The input data of vibrations and <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsation</b> loads are taken from previous studies. The softwares used are SOLIDWORK 2005 and ALGOR V 16. Base on the simulation results obtained, the maximum stress of both materials are compared to distinguish which is better in resisting the vibration loads applied...|$|R

Model test has been conducted in the Water Power Laboratory at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The data collected from the model test has been compared with corresponding data from field measurements at the geometrical similar prototype. Three operation points have been compared; these were 42 %, 50 % and 75 % load. The comparisons were made from three different locations; draft tube cone, runner blade and vaneless space. As a scale-up relation the A/H fraction has been tested, {{but none of the}} pressure transducer showed a tendency to follow this relation. Moreover it have been conducted <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsation</b> measurements on the model turbine for different sigma levels. These measurements were conducted at 50 % load with four different sigma levels with the range of 0. 026 to 0. 050. The sigma variation influence proved to be significant in the draft tube, and marginal in the runner. For the vaneless space the influence could be neglected. However the results from all the transducers showed a tendency of an increase in <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsation</b> amplitude with decrease in sigma level. </p...|$|R
