ABSTRACT: The {{biodegradability}} of <b>polycyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> such as naphthalene, fluorene, anthracene and phenanthrene by a halotolerant bacterial consortium {{isolated from}} marine environment was investigated. The <b>polycyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> degrading bacterial consortium was enriched from mixture saline water samples collected from Chennai (Port of Chennai, salt pan), India. The consortium potently degraded <b>polycyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> (> 95 %) at 30 g/L of sodium chloride concentration in 4 days. The consortium {{was able to}} degrade 39 to 45 % of different polycyclic hydrocarbons at 60 g/L NaCl concentration. Due to increase in salinity, the percent degradation decreased.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that Soderberg {{aluminum}} smelters are a large source of anthropogenic <b>polycyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the environment. The atmospheric fate of <b>polycyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> is of importance to the aluminum industry in Canada due to their environmental persistence and potential health effects. For Soderberg smelters, the fate of facility emissions is of concern due to the involuntary nature of exposure by the general public in the surrounding regions. Excellent relationships between benzo[a]pyrene and <b>polycyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> between different types of Soderberg facilities and raw material formulations were found in the occupational environment during this investigation. This was followed by the comparison of emission profiles of a horizontal stud Soderberg aluminum smelter with profiles measured in a network of sampling stations in the adjacent community. The results suggested that benzo[a]pyrene may be less stable than the majority of the <b>polycyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> An analysis of different sampling sites across Canada revealed that station profiles in the vicinity of Soderberg facilities were different from those found for sites impacted by steel plants, traffic and domestic heating. To explain some of the observed differences, it was hypothesized that <b>polycyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> on particulate matter approach a relatively stable profile that is based on the particle characteristics and source intensities.

25|$|To {{understand}} the DNA damage theory of aging {{it is important}} to distinguish between DNA damage and mutation, the two major types of errors that occur in DNA. Damage and mutation are fundamentally different. DNA damage is any physical abnormality in the DNA, such as single and double strand breaks, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine residues and <b>polycyclic</b> <b>aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> adducts. DNA damage can be recognized by enzymes, and thus can be correctly repaired using the complementary undamaged sequence in a homologous chromosome if it is available for copying. If a cell retains DNA damage, transcription of a gene can be prevented and thus translation into a protein will also be blocked. Replication may also be blocked and/or the cell may die. Descriptions of reduced function, characteristic of aging and associated with accumulation of DNA damage, are given later in this article.|$|E
