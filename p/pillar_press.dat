His {{collection of short}} stories, Tales from Rainwater Pond was published by <b>Pillar</b> <b>Press,</b> Kilkenny, in 2006. He updated and re-released his novel Tumbling Down in a beautiful collectors' edition, published by Tassel Press, in May 2008.|$|E
30|$|The {{normally}} used empirical formulas {{to predict the}} height of water conducting fissure zone originate from «Regulations of buildings, water, railway and main well lane leaving coal <b>pillar</b> and <b>press</b> coal mining» and «Mine Hydrogeology Regulations» (Hu et al. 2012). However, height of water conducting fissure zone is highly influenced by {{various factors such as}} geological conditions, roof overburden structure and coal mining process. More and more researches have focused on correction of the empirical formula by validating the height of the water conducting fissure zone, or to propose a new formula for predicting the height of water conducting fissure zone.|$|R

5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve <b>pillar</b> and <b>presses</b> the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|R
40|$|Metal forming is {{a process}} which is done by {{deforming}} metal work pieces to the desired shape and size using pressing or hammering action. Hydraulic presses are being used for forming and pressing operations with wide range of capacities. Hydraulic press machine works under continuous impact load. Because of this continuous load, tensile and compressive stresses are experienced {{in various parts of}} machine. These stresses cause permanent deformation in some parts of machine. This work is based on optimization of a 250 -ton four <b>pillar</b> type hydraulic <b>press</b> considering constraints like design, weight and cost. The work is focused on design and optimization of top plate of the press machine. Top plate holds the hydraulic cylinder {{and is one of the}} most critical parts of the machine. The design is based on sizing optimization method and the results are validated by Finite Element method with proper boundary conditions. The CAD modelling has been carried out by PTC CREO and for FEA, ANSYS software is used...|$|R
5000|$|... 1988 saw {{the launch}} of the Pillar Project, aimed at {{encouraging}} artists and architects to bring forward new ideas for an appropriate permanent memorial to replace Nelson. Suggestions included a 110 m flagpole, a triumphal arch modelled on the Paris Arc de Triomphe, and a [...] "Tower of Light" [...] with a platform that would restore Nelson's view over the city. In 1997 Dublin Corporation announced a formal design competition for a monument to mark the new millennium in 2000. The winning entry was Ian Ritchie's Spire of Dublin, a plain, needle-like structure rising 120 m from the street. The design was approved; on 22 January 2003 it was completed, despite some political and artistic opposition. During the excavations preceding the Spire's construction, the foundation stone of the Nelson <b>Pillar</b> was recovered. <b>Press</b> stories that a time capsule containing valuable coins had also been discovered fascinated the public for a while, but proved illusory.|$|R
