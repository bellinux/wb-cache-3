While the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission declared that the leak, caused by a <b>pump</b> <b>seal</b> failure, did not pose any threat to human health, many Canadians questioned the safety of nuclear power plants in Canada. Gordon Edwards, Canadian physicist and founder of the Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility, claimed that the leak [...] "shows the potential for more significant nuclear contamination of Lake Ontario [...] ". He added that the source of the Pickering plant's leak was the same as that of the incident at Fukushima I and that the leak must not be taken lightly. The Gentilly Nuclear Generating Station near Bécancour, Quebec, is the only Canadian nuclear power plant near a fault line. Quebec Premier Jean Charest issued statements that the Gentilly-2 reactor was safe, and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission declared it could withstand earthquakes.|$|E

When leakage occurs, {{it is expected to}} be from the high pressure area to the lower pressure surroundings. The basic concept of the upstream <b>pumping</b> <b>seal</b> is that the conventional seal is replaced by a low volume, high pressure ?pump?- the upstream <b>pumping</b> <b>seal.</b> This ?<b>pump?</b> propels a minute quantity of barrier liquid along the path normally sealed by the mechanical seal and into the product side.

40|$|LectureAmong the {{technologies}} developed {{for oil and}} gas production centrifugal <b>pump</b> <b>sealing</b> applications, active lift technology {{is one of the most}} promising. The reliability of any centrifugal pump in a critical application is strongly influenced by the performance of the mechanical seals. It is widely accepted based on extensive operating experience that mechanical seals are the most vulnerable components in the pump structure and their life is not easy to predict. Depending on the product being sealed and operating conditions, seals can last from a few weeks to 20 years. Active lift, also known as ?upstream <b>pumping,?</b> <b>seals</b> represent a new approach to the liquid sealing technology with the potential to offer a step change in seal reliability and resulting production gains. Developed from dry gas seal technology its major advantage over conventional contacting mechanical seals is that the face separation is stabilized and there is no rubbing between the seal faces. As rubbing is completely eliminated face deterioration is eliminated and face life is significantly extended together with a considerable reduction in the generated by the seal faces. Another important advantage of this new concept compared to traditional pressurized double seals is the elimination of a sophisticated pressurized barrier fluid system in favor of a much more simple system. It is obvious these days that ?upstream <b>pumping?</b> <b>sealing</b> technology for higher pressure pumping applications is moving from small laboratory scale trials to wide industrial application. This paper takes the form of a general review of the product development and field experience accumulated during 18 months of operation with upstream <b>pumping</b> <b>seals</b> in a critical sea water injection pump application...|$|R

5000|$|The {{change of}} air cooling to liquid cooling {{occurred}} {{at the start of}} World War II when the US military needed reliable vehicles. The subject of boiling engines was addressed, researched, and a solution found. Previous radiators and engine blocks were properly designed and survived durability tests, but used water pumps with a leaky graphite-lubricated [...] "rope" [...] seal (gland) on the pump shaft. The seal was inherited from steam engines, where water loss is accepted, since steam engines already expend large volumes of water. Because the <b>pump</b> <b>seal</b> leaked mainly when the pump was running and the engine was hot, the water loss evaporated inconspicuously, leaving at best a small rusty trace when the engine stopped and cooled, thereby not revealing significant water loss. Automobile radiators (or heat exchangers) have an outlet that feeds cooled water to the engine and the engine has an outlet that feeds heated water {{to the top of the}} radiator. Water circulation is aided by a rotary pump that has only a slight effect, having to work over such a wide range of speeds that its impeller has only a minimal effect as a pump. While running, the leaking <b>pump</b> <b>seal</b> drained cooling water to a level where the pump could no longer return water to the top of the radiator, so water circulation ceased and water in the engine boiled. However, since water loss led to overheat and further water loss from boil-over, the original water loss was hidden.|$|E
50|$|Common {{types of}} leaks {{for many people}} include leaks in vehicle tires, causing air to leak out {{resulting}} in flat tires, and leaks in containers, spilling the contents. Leaks can occur or develop in {{many different kinds of}} household, building, vehicle, marine, aircraft, or industrial fluid systems, whether the fluid is a gas or liquid. Leaks in vehicle hydraulic systems such as brake or power steering lines could cause outleakage of brake or power steering fluid resulting in failure of the brakes, power steering, or other hydraulic system. Also possible are leaks of engine coolant - particularly in the radiator and at the water <b>pump</b> <b>seal,</b> transmission fluid, motor oil, and refrigerant in the air conditioning system. Some of these vehicle fluids have different colors to help identify the type of leaking fluid. A zinc-carbon battery is an example of an easy-leaking system; the electrolytes inside the cell sometimes leak out of the cell casing and cause damage to an electronic appliance.|$|E

Murrow’s television program See It Now featured the event as a special news report, broadcast on November 24, 1957. In July 1958, Atomics International produced a film describing {{the construction of the}} Sodium Reactor Experiment facility. The Sodium Reactor Experiment used sodium as a coolant; heat generated in the reactor was transported by liquid sodium through the reactor facility piping system. The pumps used to move the sodium were hot-oil centrifugal pumps modified for use in a sodium system. A support system used tetralin (an oil-like fluid) to cool the pump seals, which prevented leakage of hot sodium at the pump shaft. In July 1959, tetralin seeped into the primary coolant system through a <b>pump</b> <b>seal</b> and was decomposed by the high-temperature sodium. The decomposed tetralin clogged several narrow cooling channels used by the sodium to remove heat from the reactor fuel elements. As the tetralin residues clogged the reactor's internal cooling channels, 13 of the reactor's 43 fuel elements overheated and were damaged. The exact date of the fuel damage is unknown, but is believed to have occurred between July 12 and 26.|$|E
40|$|There are an {{increasing}} number of nuclear reactors around the world operating well beyond their original design lives.

The two seals described are the main heavy water <b>pump</b> <b>seal</b> and the heavy water degassing <b>pump</b> <b>seal.</b> The main heavy water <b>pump</b> <b>seal</b> is a tandem seal containing two identical, but 180 º offset, eccentric seals of 95 mm balance diameter.
