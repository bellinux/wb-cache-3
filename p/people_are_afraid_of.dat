500|$|According to Wong, {{the idea}} of using a roller-coaster {{derailment}} as the opening-scene disaster came from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant and was not inspired by a Big Thunder Mountain Railroad incident. The idea of death omens in photographs was taken from The Omen (1976). Morgan revealed he searched the aisles of a local store at Sunset Boulevard for days to get inspiration regarding Erin's death at the hardware store. According to Morgan, the loss of control was a major theme that he and Wong had envisioned from the very beginning for the film; this is exemplified by both Wendy, who is afraid of losing control, as well as the roller coaster. He stated {{that one of the reasons}} <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> roller coasters is because, according to psychologists, [...] " [...] have no control" [...] while on them.|$|E

2500|$|The European {{great powers}} finally ceased their ambitions of colonizing China having {{learned from the}} Boxer rebellions {{that the best way}} to deal with China was through the ruling dynasty, rather than {{directly}} with the Chinese people (a sentiment embodied in the adage: [...] "The <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> officials, the officials are afraid of foreigners, and the foreigners are afraid of the people" [...] (...)

2500|$|Also in Sister Outsider is [...] "The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action.*" [...] Lorde {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} speaking, even when afraid because one's silence will not protect them from being marginalized and oppressed. [...] Many people fear {{to speak the truth}} because of how it may cause pain, however, one ought to put fear into perspective when deliberating whether to speak or not. [...] Lorde emphasizes that [...] "the transformation of silence into language and action is a self-revelation, and that always seems fraught with danger." [...] <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> others' reactions for speaking, but mostly for demanding visibility, which is essential to live. [...] Lorde adds, [...] "We can sit in our corners mute forever while our sisters and ourselves are wasted, while our children are distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; we can sit in our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid." [...] People are taught to respect their fear of speaking more than silence, but ultimately, the silence will choke us anyway, so we might as well speak the truth.|$|E
2500|$|Ciaran is the [...] "mùirn beatha dàn"(soulmate) of Maeve Riordan (Morgan's birth mother)and {{also the}} birth father of Morgan. He later killed Maeve and her lover Angus when {{she refused to}} be with him. He is also {{in one of the}} most {{powerful}} Woodbane covens named [...] "Amyranth" [...] who perform dark magick. And he is the leader of the coven. He is known as one of the most dangerous witches in the world, and <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> him. Ciaran captured Morgan and intended to kill her and steal her powers. One of his coven members found a watch on Morgan that he had given to Maeve as a present. As soon as Morgan had told him that she was Maeve's daughter it was unbearable for him to think that Maeve and Angus had borne a child. He performs tath meanma on Morgan and discovers that she is in fact his daughter. During the tath meanma, he witnessed Morgan's birth and her mother saying [...] "You have your father's eyes." [...] when in fact, Maeve's lover, Angus, had blue eyes and Morgan has brown, like Ciaran. In that moment Hunter comes in to save Morgan and Ciaran disappears with Hunter. The other coven members continued with the ritual. Hunter comes in again saved her with the help of Ciaran. The next time Morgan saw Ciaran was in Widows Vale they both shape-shifted into wolves. She had put a watch sigil on him to track him. After a while he contacted Morgan through a vision and said he would go to Widows Vale to meet her once again. When Ciaran went to Widows Vale he asked Morgan to join forces with him but she always declined. Until she called him and the night that she called him he was stripped of his powers.|$|E

60|$|All {{this time}} they had had no dinner, for the snake's flesh was not nice, and the lion did not like eating bear--perhaps because he never felt sure that the bear was REALLY dead, and would not jump up alive when his enemy went near him.

6000|$|The gondola stopped, the old palace was there; {{it was a}} {{house of}} the class which in Venice carries even in extreme {{dilapidation}} the dignified name. [...] "How charming!

It was not particularly old, only two or three centuries; and it had an air not so much of decay as of quiet discouragement, as if it had rather missed its career. But its wide front, with a stone balcony from end to end of the piano nobile or most important floor, was architectural enough, with the aid of various pilasters and arches; and the stucco with which in the intervals it had long ago been endued was rosy in the April afternoon. It overlooked a clean, melancholy, unfrequented canal, which had a narrow riva or convenient footway on either side. [...] "I don't know why--there are no brick gables," [...] said Mrs. Prest, [...] "but this corner has seemed to me before more Dutch than Italian, more like Amsterdam than like Venice. It's perversely clean, for reasons of its own; and though you can pass on foot scarcely anyone ever thinks of doing so. It has the air of a Protestant Sunday.
