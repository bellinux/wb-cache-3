5|$|All runways {{have been}} resurfaced with concrete, a more durable {{material}} {{than the previous}} asphalt. In April 2016, 8L/26R became the last runway to be resurfaced. This runway is also the longest at McCarran and typically serves one-third of the airport's annual traffic. Parallel to it is runway 8R/26L, which opened in 1991. On {{the western side of}} the airport are runways 1L/19R and 1R/19L. 1L/19R was originally a short runway suited for light aircraft before it was significantly widened and lengthened in 1997. Between the two sets of <b>parallel</b> <b>runways</b> was runway 14/32, which has been decommissioned. Runways 8L/26R and 8R/26L were previously 7L/25R and 7R/25L respectively. The runways were renumbered 8L/26R and 8R/26L in August 2017, following a geographical shift in the planet's magnetic poles by more than 3 degrees, the threshold for renumbering set by the FAA.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, a Spanish Learjet {{operated}} by Mar Aviation overshot runway 25 and {{collided with a}} van heading eastward on the A40 Western Avenue; the aircraft was carrying an actress bound for Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. The two pilots, the actress and van driver all suffered minor injuries. The ensuing investigation by the Civil Aviation Authority's Air Accidents Investigation Branch found that both the crew's lack of understanding English and military air traffic control procedures had {{contributed significantly to the}} crash. Subsequently, after some thirty years of protracted consideration, an ILS was eventually fitted to Northolt's redefined Runway 25. In addition, aggregate-filled safety pits were installed {{at each end of the}} runway by 21 January 1998 to protect road users in the event of another business jet or military transport failing to stop or ascend before the end of the runway. The House of Commons Transport Select Committee considered the conversion of RAF Northolt to a possible offshoot of Heathrow Airport in the 1990s. While the existing runways would cause aircraft to cross the flightpaths of those using Heathrow, new <b>parallel</b> <b>runways</b> were suggested. These suggestions were opposed by then MP for Ruislip-Northwood, John Wilkinson, and eventually progressed no further.|$|E

25|$|In Phase 1, {{the airport}} had a {{capacity}} of 30 million passengers annually, and a cargo capacity of 1.7million metric tonnes annually. In this phase, a passenger terminal with a floor space of , two <b>parallel</b> <b>runways,</b> a control tower, an administrative building, a transportation centre (the Integrated Transportation Centre, designed by Terry Farrell and Partners and Samoo Architects & Engineers), and integrated operations centre, three cargo terminals, international business centre, and a government office building were constructed.|$|E
25|$|Estimated to be {{completed}} in 2020, this is the final and the ultimate construction stage. Upon completion, the airport will have two passenger terminals, four satellite concourses, 128 gates, and five <b>parallel</b> <b>runways</b> (one exclusively for cargo flights).

The airport is projected to be transformed into one of the ten busiest airports in the world by 2020.|$|E

Northwest's flights to MSP were DTW's only nonstops west beyond Chicago and Milwaukee until 1966, when the {{remaining}} passenger airlines at Willow Run moved to Metro Airport. The North Terminal (later renamed the Davey Terminal) opened in 1966 {{and a third}} terminal, the Michael Berry International Terminal, opened in 1974. The last of its original three <b>parallel</b> <b>runways</b> (3R/21L) was completed in 1976. A new parallel crosswind runway (9R/27L) opened in 1993.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} our nation's {{airports}} depend on closely spaced <b>parallel</b> <b>runway</b> operations to handle their normal traffic throughput when weather conditions are favorable.

25|$|The Wayne County Airport Authority's latest FAA Master Plan {{includes}} {{a number of}} proposed future developments to be considered at such time as demand warrants and funding is available. A significant element of this plan is growing air service nearly 60 percent until 2030. The goals are to include better connectivity to the Middle-East, India, and nonstop flights to several key destinations in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. This addition would add to the airport's four existing <b>parallel</b> <b>runways</b> and its two crosswind runways in order to alleviate future congestion.|$|E
25|$|As of March 2010, {{information}} on future development at KSIA is scarce and conflicting.

25|$|City {{management}} {{has committed to}} a $6 billion capital investment plan to increase the airport's capacity by 60% and decrease delays by an estimated 79 percent. This plan {{was approved by the}} FAA in October 2005 and will involve a reconfiguration of the airfield and addition of terminal space. The plan includes the addition of four runways, the lengthening of two existing runways, and the decommissioning of two existing runways in order to give the airfield six <b>parallel</b> <b>runways</b> in a configuration similar to that used at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, and other large modern hub airports. This plan was very controversial as the added improvements, at the time they were proposed, were expected to increase the airport's air traffic capacity only slightly, given existing FAA rules. Additionally, the southernmost new runway would require the city acquiring additional land, which was extremely controversial as residents did not want to move.|$|E
