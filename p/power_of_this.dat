5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War, the Canadian Active Service Force (CASF) was {{initially}} composed of two divisions; the 1st and 2nd Canadian Infantry Divisions, both raised on 1September 1939. The fighting <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> force lay in its constituent infantry brigades, of which each division had three. These were in turn composed of three rifle and one machine gun battalion, with additional divisional artillery and engineer units in support.|$|E
5|$|Princess Victoria {{soon came}} to hate Conroy who bullied and insulted her, mocking her {{economical}} habits. Some historians have conjectured that Conroy's arrogant behaviour towards Victoria may have {{stemmed from a}} personal belief that his wife Elizabeth was secretly the illegitimate child of the Duke of Kent. While the rumour was later proven false, Conroy's strong ambition may have stemmed from this self-perceived connection to the aristocracy. Ambition {{may also have been}} influenced by Conroy's claim of descent from the ancient kings of Ireland. Regardless of his claims of grandeur, Conroy belonged to the middle class and recognised the growing <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> group within British society.|$|E

25|$|The invading Danes {{not only}} spared St Augustine's, but in 1027 King Cnut made {{over all the}} {{possessions}} of Minster-in-Thanet to St Augustine's. These possessions included the preserved body of Saint Mildred. Belief in the miraculous <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> relic had spread throughout Europe, and it brought many pilgrims to St Augustine's, whose gifts enriched the abbey.|$|E
25|$|The Minster {{was built}} {{by the city of}} Bern {{as a symbol of the}} growing <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> city-state. The {{interior}} was therefore designed to awe the citizens as well as foreign visitors. The central nave was built in a lacy gothic style with enormous stained glass windows and numerous altars in side chapels. The Gothic style allowed a taller central nave and larger windows than had been possible before, creating an impressive and (for the time) light and airy structure.|$|E

25|$|In {{low-level}} languages, {{the concept}} of macros has become synonymous with textual substitution of source-code due to {{the widespread use of}} the C preprocessor. However, high-level languages such as Lisp pre-dated C in their use of macros that were far more powerful. It is this Lisp-like macro concept that Perl 6 will take advantage of. The <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sort of macro {{stems from the fact that}} it operates on the program as a high-level data structure, rather than as simple text, and has the full capabilities of the programming language at its disposal.|$|E
25|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{configuration}} was to free up space for the heavy main armament, a 37mm (1.46in) Oldsmobile T9 cannon firing {{through the center of}} the propeller hub for optimum accuracy and stability when firing. This happened because H.M. Poyer, designer for project leader Robert Woods, was impressed by the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> weapon and pressed for its incorporation. This was unusual, because fighter design had previously been driven by the intended engine, not the weapon system. Although devastating when it worked, the T9 had very limited ammunition, a low rate of fire, and was prone to jamming.|$|E
25|$|The Ashanti {{government}} was built upon a sophisticated bureaucracy in Kumasi, with separate ministries {{to handle the}} state's affairs. Of particular note was Ashanti's Foreign Office based in Kumasi; despite its small size, it allowed the state to pursue complex negotiations with foreign powers. The Office was divided into departments to handle relations separately with the British, French, Dutch, and Arabs. Scholars of Ashanti history, such as Larry Yarak and Ivor Wilkes, disagree over the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sophisticated bureaucracy {{in comparison to the}} Asantahene, but agree that it was a sign of a highly developed government with a complex system of checks and balances.|$|E

25|$|The {{potential}} <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> confederation aroused {{the opposition}} of Argentina and, above all, Chile; both nations declared war on the confederation. In the initial round of hostilities, Santa Cruz managed to repel an attack by Argentina, and surrounded Chilean forces at Paucarpata where he forced the Vice Admiral Manuel Blanco Encalada to sign a peace treaty. However, the Chilean government rejected the treaty and launched a second offensive against the Confederation. Santa Cruz' decisive defeat by Chilean forces in the Battle of Yungay in January 1839, coupled with revolts in both Bolivia and Peru, resulted in {{the breakup of the}} confederation and ended the career of Bolivia's ablest nineteenth-century president. Santa Cruz went into exile in Ecuador.|$|E
25|$|The {{proximity}} to Sahand, a {{mountain in the}} south of the city, {{has been a source of}} inspiration for contemporary revolutionaries and poets alike. The <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> inspiring source, however, goes to much earlier times. Tabriz was a house for numerous Iranian writers, poets, and illumination movements. In old times the city notables, supported poets and writers by organizing periodical meetings. Within its long history it was a residence for many well known Iranian writers and poets. The list can start from the old time Rumi, Qatran, Khaqani to recent years Samad Behrangi, Gholam-Hossein Sa'edi, Parvin E'tesami. The prominent Iranian Azeri poet Mohammad-Hossein Shahriar was born in Tabriz. The culture, social values, language and the music is a mixture of what exists in rest of Iran.|$|E
25|$|The first colonies {{were settled}} on the two paths to Iberia's mineral wealth— along the North African coast and on Sicily, Sardinia and the Balearic Islands. The centre of the Phoenician world was Tyre, which served as its {{economic}} and political hub. The <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> city waned following numerous sieges by Babylonia, and then its later voluntary submission to the Persian king Cambyses and incorporation within the Persian empire. Supremacy passed to Sidon, and then to Carthage, before Tyre's eventual destruction by Alexander the Great in 332 BC. Each colony paid tribute to either Tyre or Sidon, but neither city had actual control of the colonies. This changed {{with the rise of}} Carthage, since the Carthaginians appointed their own magistrates to rule the towns and Carthage retained much direct control over the colonies. This policy resulted in a number of Iberian towns siding with the Romans during the Punic Wars.|$|E

25|$|The 1978 University of London Act saw the {{university}} {{defined as a}} federation of self-governing colleges, starting the process of decentralisation {{that would lead to}} a marked transference of academic and financial power in this period from the central authorities in Senate House to the individual colleges. In the same period, UCL and King's College regained their legal independence via acts of parliament and the issuing of new royal charters. UCL was reincorporate in 1977, while King's College's new charter in 1980 reunited {{the main body of the}} college with the corporation formed in 1829. One of the largest shifts in <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period came in 1993, when HEFCE switched from funding the University of London, which then allocated money to the colleges, to funding the colleges directly and them paying a contribution to the University.|$|E
25|$|Learning {{from his}} grandfather, Abbas (who {{had been used}} by the vying Qizilbash factions during his youth) decided to {{encourage}} this new (Caucasian) grouping in Iranian society, as he realized that he must impose his authority on the Qezelbāš or remain their tool. Under Abbas, he single-handedly encouraged the growth in influence and <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new grouping, also called the third force. It is estimated that during Abbas' reign alone some 130,000 to 200,000 Georgians, tens of thousands of Circassians, and around 300,000 Armenians were deported from the Caucasus to Persia's heartland, with a significant number gaining responsibilities and roles in Iranian society, including some of the highest positions of the state, including the ghulam corps. Many of those deported from the Caucasus settled in various regions of Iran and became craftsmen, farmers, cattle breeders, traders, soldiers, generals, governors and peasants within Iranian society.|$|E
25|$|Since he had {{attained}} {{the throne}} {{at such a}} young age, the child emperor was ruler in name only, with the real {{power in the hands of}} Empress Lê Thị, who acted as regent for her son. Since Empress Lê Thị favored Đỗ Anh Vũ, the royal court witnessed the rising <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> official who decided almost all matters of the country and despised other officials. According to Ngô Sĩ Liên in Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, the reason for the favouritism of Empress Lê Thị for Đỗ Anh Vũ was the secret personal relationship between them, as a result, some mandarins such as Vũ Đái, Nguyễn Dương, Nguyễn Quốc and Dương Tự Minh tried to topple Đỗ Anh Vũ but failed and thus died under his order. After the death of the Empress in 1147, Đỗ Anh Vũ maintained his strong position in the royal court until his own death in the eighth month of 1158. The rise of Đỗ Anh Vũ in the royal court was considered by Ngô Sĩ Liên as bad judgment on the Emperor's part, and one of the more serious weaknesses of Lý Anh Tông's reign.|$|E

25|$|Eye {{movement}} in reading involves the visual processing of written text. This {{was described by}} the French ophthalmologist Louis Émile Javal in the late 19th century. He reported that eyes do not move continuously along a line of text, but make short, rapid movements (saccades) intermingled with short stops (fixations). Javal's observations were characterised by a reliance on naked-eye observation of eye {{movement in}} the absence of technology. From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, investigators used early tracking technologies to assist their observation, in a research climate that emphasised the measurement of human behaviour and skill for educational ends. Most basic knowledge about eye movement was obtained during this period. Since the mid-20th century, there have been three major changes: the development of non-invasive eye-movement tracking equipment; the introduction of computer technology to enhance the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> equipment to pick up, record and process the huge volume of data that eye movement generates; and the emergence of cognitive psychology as a theoretical and methodological framework within which reading processes are examined. Sereno & Rayner (2003) believed that the best current approach to discover immediate signs of word recognition is through the recordings of eye movements and event-related potential.|$|E
25|$|In a {{discovery}} setting, {{the goal is}} to identify and describe cell populations correlated with an external variable (as opposed to the diagnosis setting in which {{the goal is to}} combine the predictive power of multiple cell types to maximize the accuracy of the results). Similar to the diagnosis use-case, cluster matching in high-dimensional space can be used for exploratory analysis but the descriptive <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> approach is very limited, as it is hard to characterize and visualize a cell population in a high-dimensional space without first reducing the dimensionality. Finally, combinatorial gating approaches have been particularly successful in exploratory analysis of FCM data. Simplified Presentation of Incredibly Complex Evaluations (SPICE) is a software package that can use the gating functionality of FlowJo to statistically evaluate a wide range of different cell populations and visualize those that are correlated with the external outcome. flowType and RchyOptimyx (as discussed above) expand this technique by adding the ability of exploring the impact of independent markers on the overall correlation with the external outcome. This enables the removal of unnecessary markers and provides a simple visualization of all identified cell types. In a recent analysis of a large (n=466) cohort of HIV+ patients, this pipeline identified three correlates of protection against HIV, only one of which had been previously identified through extensive manual analysis of the same dataset.|$|E
