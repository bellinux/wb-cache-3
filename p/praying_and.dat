A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there <b>praying</b> <b>and</b> crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E

5|$|The imams {{said that}} the three {{additional}} images were sent anonymously by mail to Muslims who were participating in an online debate on Jyllands-Postens website, and were apparently included to illustrate the perceived atmosphere of Islamophobia in which they lived.

This image was later found to be a wire-service photograph of a contestant at a French pig-squealing contest in the Trie-sur-Baise's annual festival. One of the other two additional images (a photograph) portrayed a Muslim being mounted by a dog while <b>praying,</b> <b>and</b> the other (a cartoon) portrayed Muhammad as a demonic paedophile.|$|E

25|$|As {{the real}} cause of dancing mania was unknown, {{many of the}} {{treatments}} for it were simply hopeful guesses, although some did seem effective. The 1374 outbreak occurred only decades after the Black Death, and was treated in a similar fashion: dancers were isolated, and some were exorcised. People believed that the dancing was a curse brought about by StVitus; they responded by <b>praying</b> <b>and</b> making pilgrimages to places dedicated to Vitus.|$|E
25|$|Some {{families}} build altars {{or small}} shrines in their homes; these sometimes feature a Christian cross, statues or {{pictures of the}} Blessed Virgin Mary, pictures of deceased relatives and other people, scores of candles, and an ofrenda. Traditionally, families spend some time around the altar, <b>praying</b> <b>and</b> telling anecdotes about the deceased. In some locations, celebrants wear shells on their clothing, so when they dance, the noise will wake up the dead; some will also dress up as the deceased.|$|E

25|$|For 41 years, Gallitzin {{traveled}} the Allegheny Mountains, often in very difficult conditions, preaching, teaching, serving, <b>praying</b> <b>and</b> offering the sacraments.

Father Gallitzin ministered faithfully until the very end of his life, and after a brief illness, died at Loretto on May 6, 1840, shortly after Easter. He was buried near St. Michael's church in Loretto.|$|E
25|$|The villagers, {{who were}} {{getting ready for a}} market day, at first did not panic or run away, and they were herded into the hamlet's commons. Harry Stanley, a machine gunner from Charlie Company, said during the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division's (CID) inquiry that the killings started without warning. He first {{observed}} a member of 1st Platoon strike a Vietnamese man with a bayonet. Then, the same trooper pushed another villager into a well and threw a grenade in the well. Next, he saw fifteen or twenty people, mainly women and children, kneeling around a temple with burning incense. They were <b>praying</b> <b>and</b> crying. They were all killed by shots in the head.|$|E
25|$|After the election, a {{state court}} ruled that Waldman's {{children}} had to be reinstated at the yeshiva, an action that was only taken after the judge held Teitelbaum in contempt and fined him personally.

It originally drew 150 signatures, but all but 15 retracted their names after being threatened with excommunication by the grand rabbi, signing a document that they had not actually read the petition. One of the dissidents who signed was attacked while <b>praying,</b> <b>and</b> state troopers had to be called in again to disperse a mob that gathered on Waldman's lawn and broke his windows.|$|E

25|$|According to his successor, Dr Meek, Mr M’Culloch {{had been}} in the habit of preaching out of doors, in the nearby gorge, because of the poor repair of the church. It was here, after sermon, that he shared the letters and written sermons he {{received}} from New England. Towards the end of January 1742, two men, Ingram More, a shoemaker, and Robert Bowman, a weaver, went through the parish, and got about 90 heads of families to sign a petition to the minister, asking that he give them a weekly lecture. Thursday evening was set for this. The first two lectures passed off as expected, and only a few persons came back to the manse for further prayer and discussion. However, on Monday 15 February, all the Fellowships in the parish turned up at the manse and spent several days <b>praying</b> <b>and</b> discussing and wondering about the great events that were being reported from England and America.|$|E
25|$|Since the Romanian Revolution of 1989, {{the church}} has been {{represented}} at European and world Pentecostal conferences, and their leaders have visited various Pentecostal churches abroad. In particular, it has close relationships with the Cleveland Church of God and the Assemblies of God. Its leaders have made frequent trips to the United States, where the Romanian Pentecostal Church has seen strong growth, due in large measure to {{a steady stream of}} immigrants. In Romania, the real strength of the movement is subject to some dispute: some sources suggest 450,000 or over 800,000 adherents, with church authorities claiming undercounting by hostile or careless census-takers. Even the census recorded a 50% jump in membership between 1992 and 2002, growth has been attributed to conversion efforts and a high birthrate among members. In 2002, 6.5% of self-declared Roma were recorded as Pentecostals, and a number of churches for Roma exist, with worship said in Romani. The church receives state subsidies but also relies on annual membership fees and donations; in addition to functions like <b>praying</b> <b>and</b> Sunday school, its activities include education, social development, social assistance (often in collaboration with NGOs), spiritual support and commercial enterprises.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said that the reason the Pope always faced the people when celebrating Mass in St Peter's was that early Christians faced eastward when <b>praying</b> <b>and,</b> due to the {{difficult}} terrain, the basilica was built with its apse to the west. Some have attributed this orientation in other early Roman churches to the influence of Saint Peter's. However, the arrangement whereby the apse with the altar is at the west end of the church and the entrance on the east is found also in Roman churches contemporary with Saint Peter's (such as the original Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls) that were under no such constraints of terrain, and the same arrangement remained the usual one until the sixth century. In this early layout, according to some experts, the people were situated in the side aisles of the church, not in the central nave. While the priest faced both the altar and east throughout the Mass, the people would face the altar (from the sides) until the high point of the Mass, where they would then turn to face east along with the priest. This view is strongly criticized {{on the grounds of the}} unlikelihood that, in churches where the altar was to the west, they would turn their backs on the altar (and the priest) at the celebration of the Eucharist.|$|E
