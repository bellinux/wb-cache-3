40|$|Abstract—In this letter, the {{capacitance}} characteristics of RF LDMOS transistors with different temperatures and layout struc-tures were studied. In a conventional fishbone structure, the <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> capacitances {{decrease with increasing}} temperature. For the ring structure, two <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> a capacitance–voltage curve have been observed at high drain voltages due to the additional corner effect. <b>In</b> addition, <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> gate-to-source/body capacitance decrease and <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> gate-to-drain capacitance increase with increasing temperature at high drain voltages. By analyzing the effects of temperature on threshold voltage, quasi-saturation current, and drift depletion capacitance, the variations of capacitances with temperature were investigated.

40|$|The {{explanation}} of twin peak empirics through multiple-steady-state growth models has one serious implication: Whenever a model generates twin <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> GDP per capita it also generates twin <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> other variables. We check for some multiple steadystate models {{whether or not}} they have twin <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> the other variables besides GDP per capita. It turns out that the required twin peaks do not exist for the textbook version of the population trap model but a modified version cannot be dismissed. Stiglitz' (1987) endogenous growth model requires twin <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> savings per capita, which are not found in the data. Models of human capital accumulation and endogenous population growth are closer to the idea of twin peaks because twin <b>peaks</b> <b>in</b> population growth rates do exist, but human capital accumulation is not exactly distributed in a way twin peaks would require but that distribution rather follows a structure of one peak with one or two stairs depending on the human capital variable. ...|$|R
