5000|$|Two-shot molding is an {{injection}} molding process using two different resins {{and only one}} of the two resins is <b>platable.</b> Typically the <b>platable</b> substrate is ABS and the non-platable substrate is polycarbonate. In a two shot component, these are then submitted to an electroless plating process where the butadiene is used to chemically roughen the surface and allow adhesion of a copper primary layer. [...] The plating chemistry can be controlled to prevent the roughening of the polycarbonate portions of the component. While not commonly found outside of cellphone antenna production, this technology is public and widely available.|$|E
5000|$|The ika sōmen is not sashimi {{according}} to some sources, one such culinary reference making the comparison that while the squid is suited for the ika sōmen, the thicker-fleshed cuttlefish is more <b>platable</b> for making into sashimi. However, {{it has also been}} pointed out that ika sōmen is synonymous with ito-zukuri or [...] "thread cut", which is a technique in sashimi-slicing.|$|E
5000|$|The Committee for Cultural Freedom (CCF) {{was founded}} on May 14, 1939. The genesis of the CCF was a {{disagreement}} among communists, socialists, leftists, and centrists in the United States over the value of forming a popular front {{and the need for}} violence, revolution, and dictatorship in establishing a more just society. Many American far left-wing intellectuals in the 1920s and 1930s were Trotskyists who believed in democracy and were opposed to the totalitarianism advocated by Joseph Stalin and Stalinism. The CCF was an attempt by John Dewey and other leftists to break with what they argued was the totalitarianism of the Communist Party USA and [...] "cleanse" [...] left-wing politics to make it more <b>platable</b> to the mainstream of American voters. But the goals of the group's founders were not uniform on this. Dewey saw the CCF as an independent organization. Hook saw the CCF as a means of undermining the popular front. Dewey believed that he could persuade other left-wing organizations to give up their belief in revolution and dictatorship and join with the CCF in promoting leftist ideals. Hook secretly worked against him in these negotiations. The CCF's statement of purpose was signed by 96 intellectuals in May 1939. However, it did not hold its first meeting until October 1939.|$|E
40|$|Pollution {{prevention}} {{has emerged}} as an effective tool for companies to attain compliance with environmental requirements. As stated in the previous chapter, using pollution prevention as the primary technique for attaining compliance also can reduce operating costs and increase profits. Metal finishing firms have achieved widespread success in reducing pollution using everything from improved housekeeping to advanced technologies. The primary goal of this manual is to describe the major pollution prevention techniques used in the metal finishing industry. Some of the technologies involve simple installations, for example, retrofitting pipes or drainboards. These methods are cost effective and can be implemented in house without outside consultation. Other methods such as metal removal from liquids and total recycling in a closed-loop system require large capital expenditures. Although EPA and the states do not mandate recycling or zero discharge, urging companies to plan new equipment purchases with these goals in mind should prove cost effective {{in the long run}} and help companies sustain environmental compliance and profitability. This manual does not attempt to make blanket judgments as to the economic feasibility of the pollution prevention options that are presented. The conditions in each facility vary, and the characteristics and quantities of the <b>platables</b> are diverse. However, loss of raw materials in metal finishing can affect at least five distinct cost categories. Facilities should consider the following in any financial evaluation of pollution prevention options: • Replacement of raw materials • Removal of the materials from the waste water before discharge (i. e., pretreatment...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculous sputum {{contains}} multiple Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) populations {{with different}} requirements for isolation in vitro. These include cells forming colonies on solid media (<b>platable</b> Mtb), cells requiring standard liquid medium for growth (non-platable Mtb), and cells requiring supplementation of liquid medium with culture supernatant for growth (SN-dependent Mtb). Here we describe protocols for the cryopreservation and direct assessment of antimicrobial tolerance of these Mtb populations within sputum. Our {{results show that}} first line drugs achieved only modest cidal effects on all three populations over 7 days (1 - 2. 5 xlog 10 reductions) and SN-dependent Mtb were more tolerant to streptomycin and isoniazid compared to <b>platable</b> and non-platable Mtb. Susceptibility of <b>platable</b> Mtb to bactericidal drugs was significantly increased after passage in vitro, thus tolerance observed in the sputum populations was likely associated with mycobacterial adaptation to the host environment at some time prior to expectoration. Our findings {{support the use of}} a simple ex vivo system for testing drug efficacies against mycobacteria phenotypically adapted during tuberculosis infection. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{ability of}} {{bacteria}} isolated from a fixed-film bioreactor to precipitate phosphate crystals {{for the treatment}} of domestic wastewater in both artificial and natural media was studied. When this was demonstrated in artificial solid media for crystal formation, precipitation took place rapidly, and crystal formation began 3 days after inoculation. The percentage of phosphate-forming bacteria was slightly higher than 75 %. Twelve major colonies with phosphate precipitation capacity were the dominant heterotrophic <b>platable</b> bacteria growing aerobically in artificial media. According to their taxonomic affiliations (based on partial sequencing of the 16 S rRNA), the 12 strains belonged to the following genera of Gram-negative bacteria: Rhodobacter, Pseudoxanthobacter, Escherichia, Alcaligenes, Roseobacter, Ochrobactrum, Agromyce, Sphingomonas and Paracoccus.

40|$|The {{status of}} the {{parthenogenetic}} millipede Amphitomeus attemsi (Schubart, 1934), a common European hothouse species originally described in Detodesmus Cook, 1896, is revised. Discovery among several hundred females of an apparently residual (=atavistic) male each in hothouses in Berlin, Freiburg and Kiel, Germany allows confirmation of Amphitomeus Verhoeff, 1941 as a "good" genus based on both male genitalic structure and certain peripheral characters, largely plesiomorphic. Based on biogeographical evidence, apparently the origin centre of A. attemsi lies somewhere in the northwestern Andes whence it has become introduced and established in Europe and southeastern Brazil. In Europe at least, its life history seems to require {{at least one year}} and the species basically feeds on rotting wood. Experimental data on <b>platable</b> gut microflora and its cellulase activity show fungi and actinomycetes, but apparently not bacteria, to be highly cellulose-dependent. Lectotype selection has been made for Oniscodesmus aurantiacus Peters, 1864...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Blind-via plays {{a crucial}} role in {{interlayer}} interconnection of printed circuit board. To get the blind via metallized a direct electroplating process has been put forward by the way of a inducing CO 2 laser beam irradiating the copper in the bottom of blind via. The method for direct electroplating of copper onto a non-copper <b>platable</b> layer has been investigated in blind via metalization. The regression analysis was used to discuss the laser beam energy in different parameters. The results of electroplated blind via showed that the copper in the bottom of blind via can be induced by CO 2 laser, and the induced copper particles ejected to the hole wall plays a role of the conductive film layer that mainly composed of copper by electroless plating or carbon black conductive film during electroplating, plasma used in cleaning blind via can promote the sorption of induced copper particles onto the via wall...|$|E
40|$|No {{straightforward}} method exists for separating {{the proportion of}} ion exchange and respiration due to rhizoplane microbial organisms from that of root ion exchange and respiration. We examined several antibiotics that might {{be used for the}} temporary elimination of rhizoplane bacteria from hydroponically grown wheat roots (Triticum aestivum cv. Veery 10). Each antibiotic was tested for herbicidal activity and plate counts were used to enumerate bacteria and evaluate antibiotic kinetics. Only lactam antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins) did not reduce wheat growth rates. Aminoglycosides, the pyrimidine trimethoprim, colistin and rifampicin reduced growth rates substantially. Antibiotics acted slowly, with maximum reductions in rhizoplane bacteria occurring after more than 48 h of exposure. Combinations of nonphytotoxic antibiotics reduced <b>platable</b> rhizoplane bacteria by as much as 98 %; however, this was generally a reduction from about 10 (9) to 10 (6) colony forming units per gram of dry root mass, so that many viable bacteria remained on root surfaces. We present evidence which suggests that insufficient bacterial biomass exists on root surfaces of nonstressed plants grown under well-aerated conditions to quantitatively interfere with root nitrogen absorption measurements...|$|E

E. coli JM 83 and JM 101, which contained plasmids pBR 322 and pUC 8, respectively, {{were placed in}} sterile artificial seawater for 21 days. Culturability was determined by plating on both nonselective and selective agar, and plasmid maintenance was monitored by direct isolation of plasmid nucleic acid from bacteria collected on Sterivex filters. E. coli JM 83 became nonculturable after incubation for 6 days in seawater yet maintained plasmid pBR 322 for the entire period of the study, i. e., 21 days. E. coli JM 101 was nonculturable after incubation in seawater for 21 days and also maintained plasmid pUC 8 throughout {{the duration of the}} microcosm experiment. Direct counts of bacterial cells did not change significantly during exposure to seawater, even though plate counts yielded no viable (i. e., <b>platable)</b> cells. We concluded that E. coli cells are capable of maintaining high-copy-number plasmids, even when no longer culturable, after exposure to the estuarine or marine environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{precipitation}} {{of calcium}} carbonate and calcium sulphate by isolated bacteria from seawater and real brine obtained in a desalination plant growth in culture media containing seawater and brine as mineral sources has been studied. However, only bioprecipitation was detected when the bacteria were grown in media with added organic matter. Biomineralization process started rapidly, crystal formation {{taking place in}} the beginning a few days after inoculation of media; roughly 90 % of total cultivated bacteria showed. Six major colonies with carbonate precipitation capacity dominated bacterial community structure cultivated in heterotrophic <b>platable</b> bacteria medium. Taxonomic identification of these six strains through partial 16 S rRNA gene sequences showed their affiliation with Gram-positive Bacillus and Virgibacillus genera. These strains were able to form calcium carbonate minerals, which precipitated as calcite and aragonite crystals and showed bacterial fingerprints or bacteria calcification. Also, carbonic anhydrase activity was observed in three of these isolated bacteria. The results of this research suggest that microbiota isolated from sea water and brine is capable of precipitation of carbonate biominerals, which can occur in situ with mediation of organic matter concentrations. Moreover, calcium carbonate precipitation ability of this microbiota could be of importance in bioremediation of CO 2 and calcium in certain environments...|$|E

The phylogenetic tree shows that most of the identified populations were evolutionarily related to the Alphaproteobacteria (91. 66 % of sequences). The minerals formed were studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX). All of these strains formed phosphate crystals and precipitated struvite (MgNH 4 PO 4 ?? 6 H 2 O), bobierrite [Mg 3 (PO 4) 2 ?? 8 H 2 O] and baricite [(MgFe) 3 (PO 4) 2 ?? 8 H 2 O]. The results obtained in this study show that struvite and spherulite crystals did not show any cell marks. Moreover, phosphate precipitation was observed in the bacterial mass but also near the colonies. Our results suggest that the microbial population contributed to phosphate precipitation by changing the media as a consequence of their metabolic activity. Moreover, the results of this research suggest that bacteria play {{an active role in the}} mineral precipitation of soluble phosphate from urban wastewater in submerged fixed-film bioreactors...|$|E
