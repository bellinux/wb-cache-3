5|$|The House Select Committee on Benghazi {{was created}} in May 2014 and {{conducted}} a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack. Its actions were often seen through the <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> domestic politics. This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation. On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee. The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves. Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee. The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines, with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability by Clinton.|$|E

40|$|Organic {{components}} of typical prismatic layers in several molluscan shells were reexamined by applying {{scanning electron microscopy}} to preparations treated with the freeze-dry or the critical-point-dry method, with the result showing the following: The interior <b>of</b> <b>prisms</b> is almost filled up with a spongy intraprismatic matrix. Also three principal types <b>of</b> <b>prisms</b> are distinguishable {{according to the state}} of development and the histochemical nature of a vertical (interprismatic) wall. Namely, <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> type 1 are separated from their neighbor by a rigid vertical wall, and are represented by calcite simple <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Pinctada and aragonite simple <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Anodonta: <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> type 2 are separated by a compound (partly rigid and partly spongy) vertical wall, and are represented by aragonite simple <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Unio; <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> type 3 are separated by a spongy vertical wall, and are represented by composite <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Tapes and Peronidia. These findings suggest that type 2 is intermediate between types 1 and 3, and that transformation of an interprismatic matrix from a "primitive" rigid matrix to a more "advanced" spongy one has probably taken place in the course <b>of</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>prisms.</b> In addition, the histochemical nature of the rigid matrix is acidophilic like the shell epidermis. Meanwhile, the spongy matrix, regardless of being inter- or intraprismatic, is basophilic, and will have some connections with mineralization <b>of</b> <b>prisms...</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1803 Gian Francesco Malfatti {{posed the}} problem of cutting three {{cylindrical}} columns out of a triangular <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> marble, maximizing the total volume of the columns. He assumed, as did many others after him, that {{the solution to this}} problem was given by three tangent circles within the triangular cross-section of the wedge. That is, more abstractly, he conjectured that the three Malfatti circles have the maximum total area of any three disjoint circles within a given triangle.|$|E
25|$|This {{emphasis}} {{on the relationship between}} anthropologists and those they study—the point that, while astronomers and stars; chemists and elements; botanists and plants are fundamentally different, anthropologists and those they study are equally human—implied that anthropologists themselves could be objects of anthropological study. Although Boas did not pursue this reversal systematically, his article on alternating sounds illustrates his awareness that scientists should not be confident about their objectivity, because they too see the world through the <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> their culture.|$|E

25|$|Böhm-Bawerk's {{critique}} of Marx's theories was put under intense scrutiny by Marxian economists, such as Nikolai Bukharin. In his Economic Theory of the Leisure Class (1927), Bukharin argued that Böhm-Bawerk's axiomatic assumptions of individual freedom in his subjectivist theories are fallacious in that economic phenomena {{can only be}} understood under the <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> a coherent, contextualised, and historical analysis of society, such as Marx's. By contrast, Austrian economists have regarded Böhm-Bawerk's {{critique of}} Marx as definitive. For example, Gottfried Haberler argued Böhm-Bawerk's thorough critique of Marx's economics was so devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} in Kansas, Simons was also able to finally finish a {{historical}} work {{which he had been}} working for years, a book entitled Social Forces in American History, published by the commercial publisher Macmillan & Co. in 1911. Simons' book was a temperate survey of American history from the age of discovery through Civil War reconstruction written through the <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> class struggle. Although Simons professed that he was writing as a Marxist, the tone and content of the work was so moderate that some reviewers did not even recognize the book as a socialist document.|$|E

In Cunningham's book it is one day in the life of each of the three central characters; Clarissa Vaughan, Laura Brown and Virginia Woolf herself. Through this prism, Cunningham attempts, as did Woolf, to show the beauty and profundity of every dayeven the most ordinaryin every person's life and conversely how a person's whole life can be examined through the <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> one single day.|$|E

25|$|In Ancient Rome, fellatio was {{considered}} profoundly taboo. Sexual acts were generally {{seen through the}} <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> submission and control. This is apparent in the two Latin words for the act: irrumare (to penetrate orally), and fellare (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it {{was considered}} to be abhorrent for a male to perform fellatio, since that would mean that he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from a woman or another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, anal sex – known practitioners were supposed to have foul breath and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table.|$|E
25|$|One of Wheatstone's most ingenious devices was the 'Polar clock,' {{exhibited}} at {{the meeting of the}} British Association in 1848. It is based on the fact discovered by Sir David Brewster, that the light of the sky is polarised in a plane at an angle of ninety degrees from the position of the sun. It follows that by discovering that plane of polarisation, and measuring its azimuth with respect to the north, the position of the sun, although beneath the horizon, could be determined, and the apparent solar time obtained. The clock consisted of a spyglass, having a Nicol (double-image) prism for an eyepiece, and a thin plate of selenite for an object-glass. When the tube was directed to the North Pole—that is, parallel to the Earth's axis—and the <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> the eyepiece turned until no colour was seen, the angle of turning, as shown by an index moving with the prism over a graduated limb, gave the hour of day. The device is of little service in a country where watches are reliable; but it formed part of the equipment of the 1875–1876 North Polar expedition commanded by Captain Nares.|$|E
25|$|Leading {{constitutional}} law scholar Erwin Chemerinsky {{participated in the}} same symposium, exploring how this decision would be understood and applied by school officials, school boards, and lower court judges. He suggested that the opinion was misguided and—from a First Amendment perspective—highly undesirable, arguing that the decision cannot be justified under existing First Amendment principles, {{that it could be}} seen as authorizing punishment of students for speech that is deemed distasteful or offensive, even just juvenile. However, he noted Justice Alito's concurring opinion, which suggests that the majority opinion might be exceedingly narrow and based on a very unusual factual context; Chemerinsky noted that if Justice Alito's opinion is seen as defining the scope of the holding, then the case establishes only the power of schools to punish speech encouraging illegal drug use rather than giving school officials great discretion to punish student speech. Thus, despite the fact that Morse v. Frederick is consistent with decisions from the Supreme Court and lower federal courts over the last two decades, his hope is that Chief Justice Roberts's majority opinion will be read through the <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> Justice Alito's concurring opinion, thereby having little effect on the already very limited First Amendment rights of students.|$|E

500|$|The {{secret to}} Lord's success, {{according}} to the New York Herald Tribunes critic Stanley Walker, was that he used [...] "a kind of literary pointillism, the arrangement of contrasting bits of fact and emotion in such a fashion that a vividly real impression of an event is conveyed to the reader." [...] Walker highlighted the way that Lord had avoided telling the story through the <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> social class, which had been the usual style of previous narratives, and instead successfully depicted the human element of the story by showing how those aboard reacted to the disaster whatever their class.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the actual details of the case were known in southeastern South Australia for decades after the murders, from the 1920s a number of {{variations}} on the story appeared in print and were retold by local historians. The two key aspects of these accounts were that Brown was guilty of poisoning rather than shooting the Aboriginal people, and had subsequently undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to successfully establish his alibi. The authors Foster, Hosking and Nettelbeck have concluded that this evolution of the story worked to play down the seriousness of the crime, and demonstrated that the story had been filtered through a <b>prism</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "pioneer legend" [...] of the South Australian frontier.|$|E
