After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Tucker {{was part}} of the second U.S. {{destroyer}} squadron sent overseas. Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown, Ireland, Tucker made several rescues of passengers and crew from ships sunk by U-boats. For her part in rescuing crewmen from the Dupetit-Thouars in August 1918, Tucker received a commendation from the <b>Préfet</b> Maritime. In June, Tucker was transferred to Brest, France, and spent the remainder of the war there.|$|E

[...] Under his new <b>préfet</b> of the Seine, Baron Haussmann, and his new chief of the waters of Paris, Belgrand, [...] the Paris water system was reconstructed so that water from springs, brought by aqueducts, was used exclusively for drinking water, while less healthy river water was used for washing the streets, watering gardens and parks, and for fountains.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} {{working week}} is Monday to Friday. Shops are also open on Saturday.

Workers are not obliged to work on Sunday.

6000|$|Though M. le Comte de Cambray {{had listened}} to the <b>préfet's</b> {{narrative}} with all his habitual grandeur of mien, it soon became obvious {{that some of his}} aristocratic sangfroid had already abandoned him.

Mme. la Duchesse perceived this, no doubt, for her keen eyes were fixed scrutinisingly upon her brother; she saw too that his thin lips were quivering and that the reason why he made no comment on what he had just heard was because he could not quite trust himself to speak. It was she, therefore, who now remarked quietly: ...|$|R

[...] In his report to the General Council of the department of Indre-et-Loire, the <b>Prefet</b> (official in charge of a French department) does not even mention the situation. [...] The general reaction is one of complete indifference.

2500|$|As {{more and}} more {{resistance}} groups started to appear, {{it was agreed that}} more could be achieved by working together than apart, and the chief promoter of unification was a former <b>préfet</b> of Chartres, Jean Moulin. After identifying [...] the three largest resistance groups in the south of France that he wanted to see co-operate, Moulin decided to go to Britain to seek support. Moulin made a secret trip, visiting Lisbon on 12 September 1941 from where he traveled to London to meet General de Gaulle on 25 October 1941. De Gaulle named Moulin his representative in France and ordered him to return and unify all Resistance groups and to have them recognize the authority of de Gaulle's Free French National Committee in London, which very few resistance groups did at the time. To lend further support de Gaulle founded in October 1941 the BCRA (Bureau Central de Renseignements et d'Action -Central Office for Intelligence and Action) under André Dewavrin who used the code-name [...] "Colonel Passy" [...] to provide support for the Resistance. Through the BCRA was based in an office in Duke Street in London, its relations with the SOE were often strained as de Gaulle made no secret of his dislike of British support for the resistance groups, which he saw as British meddling in France's domestic affairs. Tensions between Gaullist and non-Gaullist resistance groups led to the SOE dividing its F section into two with RF section providing support for Gaullist groups and the F section dealing with the non-Gaullist groups.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spring of}} 1944 is remembered in France as {{time of the}} mentalité terrible, the period of la guerre franco-française when the Milice and the Maquis fought one another without mercy. The Milice and maquis were caught up in ever-escalating cycle of {{violence}} with Ousby commenting: [...] "1944 had simply become the time for settling scores, any scores, for revenging grudges, any grudges. Agreed on this common imperative, the sides in the conflict blur and become almost indistinguishable from each other. The Milice hit squads pretended to be the Maquis; the Maquis hit squads pretended to be the Milice. Sometimes {{it was impossible to}} tell which was really which, and sometimes it hardly mattered". As it was starting to become more and more clear that the Allies were going to win the war, the Milice become more desperate and vicious as the knowledge that when the Allies won, the miliciens would be tried for treason if they not killed out of hand first, caused the Milice to engage in increasing savage torture and killings of the maquisards, hoping against hope that they could annihilate all of their enemies before the Allies won. For their part, some of the maquisards struck back in kind against the Milice. In the town of Voiron, close to Grenoble, in April 1944, a Maquis assassination squad entered the home of the local Milice chief and killed him, his wife, his infant daughter, his 10-year-old son, and his 82-year-old mother. Outside the village of Saint-Laurent in the Haute-Savoie, a mass grave was discovered in May 1944 of eight gendarmes known for their loyalty to Vichy kidnapped by the Maquis from Bonneville who had been lined up and shot by their captors. The killing of the gendarmes was denounced by the chief collaboratorist propagandist Philippe Henriot on the radio as the [...] "French Katyn", who used the killings as an example of the sort of [...] "Bolshevik terrorism" [...] that he maintained was typical of the resistance. In the south of France, the Maquis had started to form an alternative government to Vichy, which still controlled the French civil service. Georges Guingouin, the Communist maquis leader of the Maquis du Limousin in the Limousin region styled himself a <b>préfet</b> and imposed his own system of rationing on the local farmers that flouted the rationing system imposed by Vichy. In the Auxois region, the Maquis Bernard had created its system of taxation with people being taxed on the basis of their willingness to collaborate with the authorities or support the resistance. When the British philosopher A. J. Ayer arrived in Gascony as a SOE agent in the spring of 1944, he described a power structure established by the maquis that placed power [...] "in the hands of a series of feudal lords whose power and influence were strangely similar to that of their fifteenth-century Gason counterparts".|$|E
60|$|Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen, therefore, did not willingly {{place her}} aristocratic {{fingers in the}} hand of a renegade, who she felt might turn renegade again if his {{personal}} interest so dictated it. Perhaps something of what lay behind Madame's curt nod to him, struck the <b>préfet's</b> sensibilities, for the high colour suddenly fled from his round face, and he did not attempt to approach her for the ceremonial hand-kissing. But he ran across the room as fast as his short legs would carry him, and he opened the door for her and bowed to her as she sailed past him with all the deference which in the olden days of the Empire he had accorded to the Empress Marie Louise.|$|R
60|$|She did {{not wait}} {{long enough to}} allow M. le Comte time to ring for Hector, and she {{appeared}} so busy with her lace shawl that {{she was unable to}} do more than acknowledge with a slight inclination of the head M. le <b>préfet's</b> respectful salute. But then Mme. la Duchesse douairière d'Agen--though a fervent royalist herself--had a wholesome contempt for these opportunists. Fourier, celebrated mathematician, loaded with gifts and honours by Napoleon, who had made him a member of the Institute of Science and given him the prefecture of the Isère, had turned his coat very readily at the Restoration, and the oaths of loyalty which he had tendered to the Emperor seemed not to weigh overheavily upon his conscience when he reiterated them to the King.|$|R
50|$|The Jospin Government also {{established}} (within {{the framework of}} a policy to improve coverage for industrial diseases) of a compensation fund for asbestos victims, and extended the right to asylum. A conditional amnesty for illegal immigrants was carried out, with some 75,000 obtaining legal residence as a result. Measures aimed at reintegrating the very long-term unemployed into the workforce were strengthened in 1998, and emergency groups were set up that same year in each département coordinated by the senior local representatives of the government at département level (<b>préfets),</b> with the objective of examining individual payments to those most in need. An overhaul of housing assistance scales was carried out, and a law on gender equality at work was introduced. This legislation removed the ban on night work for women, and introduced new regulations for this type of work, with covered all employees. A social security funding law for 2002 was passed which, amongst other measures, provided a general rise in pensions and increased paternity leave (from 3 to 11 days).|$|R
