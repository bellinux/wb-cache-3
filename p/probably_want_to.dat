500|$|Regarding Broadway, MacFarlane told The Hollywood Reporter, [...] "If I did a Broadway musical, I'd <b>probably</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do {{something}} a little bit more old-fashioned", and went on saying [...] "I wouldn't necessarily {{do something}} that was as edgy as what they ] and [...] have done. The challenge to me would be more along the lines of, gosh, can somebody write Oklahoma! for 2011?" [...] He has also said that, [...] "The good thing about Broadway is that you don't have to worry about an airdate. It gets done when it gets done." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the mostly}} {{positive}} reviews, Star Fox Adventures is often criticised for its setting being {{too much of}} a departure from the other Star Fox games. Casamassina said that [...] "Fans expecting a true Star Fox experience akin to the older games are in for a disappointment". He also added that the Star Fox license has been utilised sparingly {{to the point where the}} game felt [...] "out of place within the confines of the Star Fox game universe". Casamassina asserted that Fox was [...] "clearly only on 'Dinosaur Planet' at Nintendo's request, not because he belongs". NGC Magazine similarly expressed concern on why Fox was added to the game, adding that Adventures was [...] "one game Fox himself would <b>probably</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> forget" [...] and further speculating that Nintendo only added the Star Fox license to prevent Dinosaur Planet from appearing on the Xbox.|$|E
500|$|Homer captures Molloy at the {{retirement}} home, and the surprisingly amiable cat burglar returns the objects he stole. Chief Wiggum arrests {{him and he}} is imprisoned. While in his cell at the police station, Molloy casually mentions that he assumes Homer and the cops <b>probably</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know where he hid all of his loot. This piques their interest, and Molloy tells them the stash is hidden under a giant [...] "T" [...] somewhere in Springfield. They all rush {{out of the station}} hoping to get the treasure for themselves. In a matter of minutes the entire town hears of the existence of Molloy's stash and almost everybody in Springfield is racing to get there first. After the residents get to the site and dig, they finally discover a box with a note inside. The note tells them that there is no treasure and that while they have been searching, Molloy has escaped from his cell. However, several citizens continue to dig, convinced that a real treasure must be buried deeper.|$|E

5000|$|On the {{original}} lyrics, Reed said, [...] "Jesus. Best left forgotten. Obviously, I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use real names yet. I <b>probably</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make sure I wasn't using {{a name that}} really meant something to me." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1154, Eudoxia married Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland, who had {{recently}} lost his first wife, Princess Elisabeth of Hungary. With this union, Mieszko III <b>probably</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> cement his relations with the Rurikid rulers.|$|R
500|$|The Dreamcast port of Incoming {{received}} a mixed reaction from critics. IGN opened their review by saying that, although the game [...] "is lacking in many areas, there's {{more than enough}} here for the hardcore shooting fans out there to have their requisite blast of shooting action." [...] Though criticizing the graphics' ability to [...] "get in the way at times," [...] the [...] "very vague" [...] mission briefings and the [...] "odd flying model for the planes," [...] the reviewer conceded that [...] "if you're a hardcore shooting fan, and you're {{looking for a good}} challenge, you'll <b>probably</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> look into Incoming." [...] GameSpy's review was harsher, describing the plot as [...] "the same recycled garbage used in tons of other games of this type," [...] the multiplayer split screen mode as [...] "lame" [...] and the objectives as [...] "mundane." [...] The reviewer also noted graphical issues, clipping problems and poor controls. Though dismissing the graphics as [...] "a bit dated," [...] the reviewer did acknowledge the [...] "nifty special effects" [...] and admitted that [...] "Incoming may be worth a rental... is only slightly better than mediocre." [...] In a rare positive review for the Dreamcast version, GameVortex described the visuals as [...] "some of the most breathtaking visuals you'll find in any game." [...] Though describing the multiplayer as [...] "fun", it considered [...] "by far, the best [...] Campaign mode." [...] The review concluded by describing the game as [...] "lots of fun and highly recommended." ...|$|E
2500|$|William Sebald responded, [...] "I have {{personally}} {{followed this}} controversy {{over a long}} period of time... although Japan is free to do as it thought best in presenting its case, the Security Council would <b>probably</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see that all bilateral efforts have been exhausted before hearing the case." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2014, Sulkowicz filed {{a report}} against Nungesser with the New York Police Department (NYPD), but {{declined}} to pursue an investigation after Sulkowicz discovered the case could extend past her graduation, when she would <b>probably</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> [...] "erase all of [...] memories of Columbia". Sulkowicz further stated that NYPD officers [...] "badly mistreated" [...] her and [...] "were dismissive {{of what she had}} to say". The district attorney's office interviewed Sulkowicz and Nungesser, but did not pursue charges, citing lack of reasonable suspicion.|$|E
5000|$|Wynwyn Marquez also portrays Danica Benitez, Maika's bitter {{twin sister}} and Hazel's half-sister. At first, she haunts them and acted like Maika. But {{eventually}} revealed as Danica. She <b>probably</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> get revenge to Hazel, because of Maika's death.|$|R
5000|$|Emily Rome of EW wrote, [...] "Oh, boy, Grimm, {{way to get}} so... grim. In {{what may}} be the show's darkest episode yet, Nick learns more than he <b>probably</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> about his ancestry, and things heat up between Juliette and Renard." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{destruction}} of the abbey was probably ordered by the French King Francis I, who occupied the city on 11 September 1543 during the Italian War of 1542-46, and <b>probably</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> prevent troops of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, from occupying the abbey during the next siege.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2014, {{longtime}} drummer and percussionist Kliph Scurlock {{left the}} band, he {{was replaced by}} drummer, percussionist and keyboardist Matt Duckworth, and the band added percussionist and drummer Nicholas Ley, Derek Brown began focusing on guitars, and occasional keyboards and percussion. In May, Scurlock claimed he had been fired for negative comments about Wayne Coyne's friend Christina Fallin, the daughter of Oklahoma's governor and leader of a band called Pink Pony. Fallin had recently been criticized for cultural appropriation after she wore a Native American headdress in a publicity photo. [...] According to Scurlock, his criticism of Fallin's actions led to conflict with Coyne and his dismissal. In response, Drozd said, [...] "his Lips/Kliph bullshit has gone too far. We parted ways because of the usual band musical differences. The rest has been blown way out." [...] Coyne went even further, calling Scurlock a [...] "pathological liar" [...] and stated that he never meant his defense of Fallin, which included posting a photo of his dog in a feathered headdress, to be offensive {{but that he was}} [...] "very sorry, to anybody that is following my Instagram or my Twitter, if I offended anybody of any religion, any race, any belief system. I would say you shouldn't follow my tweets; you shouldn't even <b>probably</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a Flaming Lips fan because we don't really have any agenda." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{would have}} been as bad as to show themselves.

50|$|The {{defeat of}} invading Hungarians brought the same {{benefits}} to both Germans and Czechs. Less obvious is what Boleslaus <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> gain from his participation {{in the war against}} the Obotrite Slavic dukes in far north.

6000|$|... "I {{see what}} you mean," [...] said my friend, a little impatiently. [...] "You mean sumptuary legislation. But I have not come {{to talk to you}} upon that subject, for then you would <b>probably</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do all the talking yourself.

6000|$|... "I {{will take}} another opportunity," [...] said the minister. [...] "As you have raised that {{somewhat}} trite objection of the bearing of children, which we in our country, sir, have altogether got over, I must {{put you in}} possession of my views on that subject; but I will find another occasion."

25|$|Lomax left Harvard, {{after having}} spent {{his sophomore year}} there, to join John A.

"To-morrow," [...] he said, [...] "perhaps to-night, we {{have some}} railway men coming down to {{thoroughly}} discuss the most efficient method of moving troops from Aldershot and London to different points, and to inaugurate a fresh system.

6000|$|... 'One {{of these}} days, Mr Ford,' I said, 'I {{am going to}} publish a {{directory}} of the names and addresses {{of the people who}} have mistaken me for Smooth Sam Fisher. I am not Sam Fisher. Can you grasp that? My name is Peter Burns, and for the past term I have been a master at this school.

The force will <b>probably</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> start, before that time; and we shall have to victual both the land and water columns.

50|$|Castro {{received}} {{economic assistance}} during his old age. The official {{data from this}} office showed his birthplace as New York City. After the S.S.

50|$|Furthermore, {{his reason}} {{could also be}} financial. As {{explained}} by McKenzie, the unsanitary London prisons were very expensive.

50|$|Lancaster was platted on Oct. 5, 1815 by David Hillis and William McFarland.

I shan't like seeing you whizz down the air.... You'd better make yourself useful, Smallways. I think I shall requisition you for my squad. You'll have to work, you know, and be infernally intelligent and all that. And you'll have to hang about upside down a bit. Still, it's the best chance you have. We shan't carry passengers much farther this trip, I fancy. Ballast goes over-board--if we don't want to ground precious soon and be taken prisoners of war. The Prince won't do that anyhow. He'll be game to the last." ...|$|E
60|$|Respected Hopkins,[18]--This is {{to inform}} you that the Jersey cow had an elegant little cow-calf Sunday last. There {{was a great deal of}} rejoicing, of course; but I don't know whether or not you {{remember}} the Jersey cow. Whatever else she is, the Jersey cow is not good-natured, and Dines, who was up here on some other business, went down to the paddock to get a hood and to milk her. The hood is a little wooden board with two holes in it, by which it is hung from her horns. I don't know how he got it on, and I don't believe he does. Anyway, in the middle of the operation, in came Bull Bazett, with his head down, and roaring like the last trumpet. Dines and all his merry men hid behind trees in the paddock, and skipped. Dines then got upon a horse, plied his spurs, and cleared for Apia. The next time he is asked to meddle with our cows, he will <b>probably</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know the reason why. Meanwhile, there was the cow, with the board over her eyes, left tied by a pretty long rope to a small tree in the paddock, and who was to milk her? She roared,--I was going to say like a bull, but it was Bazett who did that, walking up and down, switching his tail, and the noise of the pair of them was perfectly dreadful.|$|E
6000|$|I think, by the way, I should, if I were you, take or {{send out}} a few [...] servants--not too many at first, only just enough to attend on our [...] two selves.

50|$|Merutunga, on {{the other}} hand, states that Bhima's three sons were Mularaja, Karna and Haripala. Of these, Haripala was born of a courtesan named Bakuladevi. Historian A. K.

Hemachandra, who was a royal courtier, <b>probably</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid mentioning the illegitimate son Haripala, and therefore, glossed over the genealogy.|$|R
