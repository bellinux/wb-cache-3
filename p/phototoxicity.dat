40|$|A {{series of}} {{asymmetric}} porphyrins with varying substituents, such as 4 -hydrophenyl and N-methyl- 4 -pyridyl, were synthesized and characterized and their cell uptake, intracellular localization, cytotoxicities and <b>phototoxicities</b> were evaluated in vitro. The most phototoxic of the porphyrins synthesized, 5, 10 -di-(N-methyl- 4 -pyridyl) - 15, 20 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 21, 23 H-porphyrin, which was mainly localized in the mitochondria and displayed {{low levels of}} dark toxicity toward human cancer HeLa cells, offers potential application in photodynamic therapy.

In the dark, the complexes presented high cytotoxicity towards only melanoma and ovarian cancer cells. However, the complexes exhibited good <b>phototoxicities</b> toward all cancer cells (1 μM concentration, LD(50) = 2 - 7 J/cm(2)), thus suggesting a dual synergistic effect with good properties {{of both the}} arene ruthenium chemotherapeutics and the porphyrin photosensitizers...|$|R
40|$|Two new photosensitizers {{based on}} the BODIPY {{scaffold}} have been synthesized, of which one bears an NLS peptide, which {{is linked to the}} BODIPY’s core using the copper catalysed azide–alkyne click reaction.

Although the conjugation of a single NLS peptide to the BODIPY did not lead to any observable nuclear localization, the photosensitizer did exhibit a superior photoxicity.

25|$|Thus, {{it appears}} that a brief 0.25-second {{exposure}} to a <5nbsp&mW laser such as found in red laser pointers does not {{pose a threat to}} eye health. On the other hand, there is a potential for injury if a person deliberately stares into a beam of a classnbsp&IIIa laser for few seconds or more at close range. Even if injury occurs, most people will fully recover their vision. Further experienced discomforts than these may be psychological rather than physical. With regard to green laser pointers the safe exposure time may be less, and with even higher powered lasers instant permanent damage should be expected. These conclusions must be qualified with recent theoretical observations that certain prescription medications may interact with some wavelengths of laser light, causing increased sensitivity (<b>phototoxicity).</b>|$|E

Various <b>phototoxicities</b> of ZnO NPs and TiO 2 NPs were reported on several organisms. It was still necessary to evaluate the toxicity of photoreactive ZnO NPs and TiO 2 NPs due to species-specific effects under various irradiation conditions. We compared the acute toxicity of Moina macrocopa under visible, ultraviolet (UV) A, and B irradiations, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines for the testing of chemicals (Test No. 202). The sensitivity of ZnO NPs for M. macrocopa was UVB>UVA>visible light irradiation. There were no significant lethal and immobile effects of TiO 2 NPs on juveniles under all irradiations and in the tested concentrations of TiO 2 NPs.

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) induces {{cell death}} through light {{activation}} of a photosensitizer (PS). Targeted delivery of PS via monoclonal antibodies has improved tumor selectivity. However, these conjugates have long half-lives, leading to relatively long photosensitivity in patients. In {{an attempt to}} target PS specifically to tumors and to accelerate PS clearance, we have developed new conjugates consisting of nanobodies (NB) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and a traceable PS (IRDye 700 DX). These fluorescent conjugates allow the distinction of cell lines with different expression levels of EGFR. Results show that these conjugates specifically induce cell death of EGFR overexpressing cells in low nanomolar concentrations, while PS alone or the NB–PS conjugates {{in the absence of}} light induce no toxicity. Delivery of PS using internalizing biparatopic NB–PS conjugates results in even more pronounced <b>phototoxicities.</b> Altogether, EGFR-targeted NB–PS conjugates are specific and potent, enabling the combination of molecular imaging with cancer therapy...|$|R
40|$|Three binary {{molecule}} conjugates {{were designed}} and synthesized by conjugating a chromophore (3, 6 -bis-(1 -methyl- 4 -vinylpyridinium) -carbazole diiodide, BMVC) to mono-, bis- and trishydroxyl photosensitizers, respectively. BMVC {{plays the role of}} cancer cells recognizer; AIEE (aggregation-induced emission enhancement) generator and FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) donor. The self assembling properties of these binary conjugates result in different degrees of AIEE and then achieve the formations of FONs (fluorescent organic nanoparticles), which present efficient FRET and singlet oxygen generations. Biologically, FONs-photosensitizers from these compounds were much more <b>phototoxicities</b> to cancer cell than to normal cell without significant dark toxicity. In addition, their intracellular fluorescent colors switching upon photo-excitation are expected to be used for further cell death biomarker applications. This improved photodynamic activity might be due to the aggregation of compounds in the cell that form FONs which can promote PDT (photodynamic therapy) and are observed in cancer cell but not normal cell.

The biological effects {{of all these}} derivatives were assessed on human melanoma tumor cells, and their cellular uptake and intracellular localization were determined. All molecules, except the rhodium complex which was not cytotoxic, demonstrated comparable cytotoxicity {{in the absence of}} laser irradiation. The ruthenium complexes exhibited excellent <b>phototoxicities</b> toward melanoma cells when exposed to laser light at 652 nm. Cellular uptake and localization microscopy studies of [Ru 4 (eta (6) -C 6 H 5 CH 3) 4 (TPP) Cl 8] and [Rh 4 (eta (5) -C 5 Me 5) 4 (TPP) Cl 8] revealed that they accumulated in the melanoma cell cytoplasm in granular structures different from lysosomes.

In the absence of light, all tetranuclear complexes were cytotoxic (IC 50 ≤ 20 μM), while the mononuclear derivatives were not (IC 50 ≥ 100 μM). Kinetic studies of tritiated thymidine and tritiated leucine incorporations in cells exposed to a low concentration (5 μM) of tetranuclear p-cymene derivatives demonstrated a rapid inhibition of DNA synthesis, while protein synthesis was inhibited only later, suggesting arene ruthenium–DNA interactions as the initial cytotoxic process. All complexes exhibited <b>phototoxicities</b> toward melanoma cells when exposed to laser light of 652 nm. At low concentration (5 μM), LD 50 of the mononuclear derivatives was between 5 and 10 J/cm 2, while for the tetranuclear derivatives LD 50 was approximately 2. 5 J/cm 2 for the [Ru 4 (η 6 -arene) 4 (tetra- 4 -pp) Cl 8] complexes and less than 0. 5 J/cm 2 for the [Ru 4 (η 6 -arene) 4 (tetra- 3 -pp) Cl 8] complexes. Examination of cells under a fluorescence microscope revealed the [Ru 4 (η 6 -arene) 4 (tetra- 4 -pp) Cl 8] complexes as cytoplasmic aggregates, whereas the [Ru 4 (η 6 -arene) 4 (tetra- 3 -pp) Cl 8] complexes were homogenously dispersed in the cytoplasm.

Compounds 1 - 3 were assessed on different types of human cancer cells and normal cells. Their uptake by cells was quantified by fluorescence and checked by fluorescence microscopy.
