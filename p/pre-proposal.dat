5000|$|The V-model first {{appeared}} at Hughes Aircraft circa 1982 {{as part of}} the <b>pre-proposal</b> effort for the FAA Advanced Automation System (AAS) program. It eventually formed the test strategy for the Hughes AAS Design Competition Phase (DCP) proposal. It was created to show the test and integration approach which was driven by new challenges to surface latent defects in the software. The need for this new level of latent defect detection was driven by the goal to start automating the thinking and planning processes of the air traffic controller as envisioned by the automated enroute air traffic control (AERA) program. The reason the V is so powerful comes from the Hughes culture of coupling all text and analysis to multi dimensional images. It was the foundation of Sequential Thematic Organization of Publications (STOP) [...] created by Hughes in 1963 and used until Hughes was divested by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1985.|$|E

The goal of the proposed program is to improve the health of poor people by breeding staple food crops that are rich in micronutrients, a process referred to here as biofortification. ” The Biofortification Challenge Program seeks to bring the full potential of agricultural and nutrition science to bear on the persistent problem of micronutrient malnutrition. Micronutrient malnutrition, primarily the result of diets poor in bioavailable vitamins and minerals, affects {{more than half of the}} world’s population, especiallywomen and preschool children. The costs of these deficiencies in terms of lives lost, forgone economic growth, and poor quality of life are staggering.

40|$|The International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) {{states in}} its current IODP Science Plan for 2013 - 2023 that the polar regions {{are one of the}} primary target areas for {{scientific}} drilling using the drill vessels Joides Resolution and Chikyu as well as various drilling options in so-called Mission-Specific Platforms. In particular this is expressed in the Science Plan’s Key Theme “Climate and Ocean Change” and its Challenge 1 “How does Earth’s climate system respond to elevated levels of atmospheric CO 2 ” and Challenge 2 “How do ice sheets and sea level respond to a warming climate”: The response of ice sheets to a warmer climate can be reconstructed from sedimentary records of relatively recent interglacial episodes when ice extent was similar, or slightly less than at present, and from much earlier times (34 - 3 Ma) when climate was several degrees warmer than today. Analysis of recently recovered ocean sediment cores suggests that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), with a potential of 4 m sea level rise, is particularly sensitive to climate change and may have collapsed many times over the last 5 million years. Estimates of sea level rise during warm intervals about 3 million years ago suggest the possibility of even larger changes. The Greenland Ice Sheet and WAIS together account for only about 12 m of potential sea level, so estimates greater than 12 m imply a significant loss of ice from the much larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet, containing the equivalent of about 52 m of sea level. Some of the major questions to be urgently addressed are: Did large sections of the West and East Antarctic Ice Sheets collapse the last time when atmospheric CO 2 levels reached 400 ppm? What are the time spans over which past ice sheet collapses occurred, and how much warming was required to push them past their “tipping points”? To answer these questions, sediment cores are needed from the Antarctic shelves and slopes where sediment accumulates rapidly. This information is needed, along with land-based records, to constrain numerical ice sheet models that attempt to predict how ice sheets melt under warmer conditions. Drilling of continental rise and deep-sea sediments at sites close to past ice sheets will provide more direct information regarding regional ice melt history and the timing of ice advance and retreat. Ultimately, the combination of these ice-proximal and ice-distal data with modelling techniques can be used to work out the relative contributions of different ice sheets to past sea level change, providing more realistic scenarios for testing predictive models and a better understanding of ice sheet behaviour in climate change situations. The general drilling strategy in IODP is to target locations ranging from polar seas to low-latitude upwelling zones to explain the behaviour of the climate system during past episodes of global warmth. This is well in line with the SCAR-PAIS approach to development of “ice-to-abyss” data transects, extending from the ice sheet interior to the deep sea in order to link ice core, ice sheet-proximal, offshore, and far-field records of past ice sheet behaviour and sea level, yielding an unprecedented view of past changes in ice sheet geometry, volume, and ice sheet-ocean interactions. About 10 drilling proposals for Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, at various stages from <b>pre-proposals</b> to revised and mature full proposals, are currently in the IODP evaluation and implementation system. Some have been forwarded to the Facility Boards for scheduling, and one proposal is already scheduled for drilling. This presentation will give an overview of these proposals and their progress stages, also with regard to the future perspectives and challenges of IODP, and will discuss strategies that may help successful proposals to be considered for drilling. ...|$|R
