40|$|The Dutch Railways {{are held}} {{accountable}} by the Ministry of Transport {{for the so-called}} ¿punctuality¿ of trains, measured at thirty-five important rail interchange points in the Netherlands. A train {{is considered to be}} punctual if it arrives within three minutes of delay. It is questionable whether such a process-oriented approach of reliability corresponds very well to the customer-oriented ambitions of the Dutch Railways. The <b>punctuality</b> <b>indicator</b> does not account for the size of the delay, or the travel time variation. Furthermore, unreliability on departure is ignored. This paper addresses these issues by identifying and comparing six different indicators and specifications. Based on a correlation analysis two clusters of indicators could be identified. Those that place specific weight to extreme delays and those that do not. Results from a series of regression and correlation analyses indicate that the two indicators in the latter cluster, i. e. the <b>punctuality</b> <b>indicator</b> as used by Dutch Railways and an alternative indicator based on the average size of the delay, are most closely related to the customer experience of travel time unreliability, in particular when an arrival-based specification of unreliability is used. For the other four indicators, which do place specific weight on extreme delays, a departure-based specification leads to better results. JRC.

40|$|In a Web Advertising Traffic Operation the Trafficking Routing Problem (TRP) {{consists}} in scheduling {{the management of}} Web Advertising (Adv) campaign between Trafficking campaigns in {{the most efficient way}} to oversee and manage relationship with partners and internal teams, managing expectations through integration and post-launch in order to ensure success for every stakeholders involved. For our own interest we did that independent research projects also through specific innovative tasks validate towards average working time declared on "specification required" by the main worldwide industry leading Advertising Agency. We present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for end-to-end management of campaign workflow along a predetermined path and generalize it to include alternative path to oversee and manage detail-oriented relationship with partners and internal teams to achieve the goals above mentioned. To meet clients' KPIs, we consider an objective function that includes the <b>punctuality</b> <b>indicators</b> (the average waiting time and completion times) but also the main <b>punctuality</b> <b>indicators</b> (the average delay and the on time performance). Then we investigate their analytical relationships in the advertising domain through experiments based on real data from a Traffic Office. We show that the classic <b>punctuality</b> <b>indicators</b> are in contradiction with the task of reducing waiting times. We propose new indicators used for a synthesize analysis on projects or process changes for the wider team that are more sustainable, but also more relevant for stakeholders. We also show that the flow of a campaign (adv-ways) is the main bottleneck of a Traffic Office and that alternate paths cannot improve the performance indicators.

40|$|Service {{reliability}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important determinants for shifting people to public transport. In low-frequency services, the reliability is considered in terms of punctuality, which becomes significant also from the standpoint of operators, given that <b>punctuality</b> <b>indicators</b> are generally included in business models. As a support for further improvement in bus punctuality in the urban area of Rome, analyses were carried out using automatic vehicle location (AVL) data of a bus line with services mixed with other traffic components and therefore subject to high degrees of travel time variability. The analyses allowed the systematic components of bus dispatching irregularity to be revealed and to investigate to what extent these components are influenced by road congestion, and hence by delayed arrival times at terminals...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} service performance of government agencies, the stakeholders {{have to pay attention}} to  the satisfaction of the public it serves. This study aimed to determine the level of public satisfaction and further will be analyzed the gap between service performances of the agency and public satisfaction to the service of Land  Office of Bekasi City. This research was conducted at the Land Office of Bekasi City; held from March to June  2014. The design used in this study was a cross-sectional study. The samples were chosen by convenience  sampling technique. Analysis of the gap was measured by Importance Performance Analysis (IPA). The results  showed that the quality of land registration services that was provided by the Land Office of Bekasi City had not  meet people's satisfaction. This was indicated by the difference between the average score of the service  performance (3, 22) and an the average score of the expectations (3, 77). This finding showed a gap of - 0, 55 that  means the service performance of the agency still lower that public expectation for the services. Moreover,  <b>punctuality</b> was <b>indicator</b> that that had high gap score between the service performance and public satisfaction.   Therefore, Land Office of Bekasi should have a policy to discipline its employees to be on time in service of land  registration. </span...|$|R
30|$|Applying daily {{values for}} the overall period, the {{correlation}} coefficients typically have an absolute value of between 0.08 and 0.19 (significant at 0.000). For the overall period, the variables attributed to snow depth are shown to have the highest correlation with punctuality, {{which is consistent with}} the results of the correlation analysis for the weekly data. On a year-by-year basis, the highest correlations are also observed between <b>punctuality</b> and snow <b>indicators,</b> the maximum of which happened in the year 2010 for low punctuality attributed to the sum of snow depth with an r value of −[*] 0.44 (significant at 0.000), followed by an r value of −[*] 0.36 (significant at 0.000) in 2013, and an r value of −[*] 0.35 (significant at 0.000) in 2012. It is noticeable that in comparison with the weekly dataset, the value of the coefficient has decreased. There might be several explanations for this difference. One possible explanation is that fluctuations in punctuality and weather data increase when one considers daily values instead of averages of daily samples as weeks. Weekly data are more aggregated, and the aggregation will compensate for random fluctuations [35]. The correlation coefficients are therefore expected to be lower for daily data than for more aggregated weekly data.|$|R
40|$|Long and {{frequent}} train delays, striking many periodically make headlines. The question is raised: {{what might be}} done about it? The on-going deregulation of the Swedish railway, with more actors entering the market, contributes to the question's topicality. In this thesis, problems and symptoms concerning punctuality are described and analysed. Herein, punctuality {{is defined as the}} extent to which an event takes place when agreed, for example the agreement between passengers and the company selling the ticket, considering the event that the train arrives at a certain time. The terminology in use on punctuality-related entities is floating. Causes for unpunctuality are related to the infrastructure, locomotives, wagons and personnel. Herein, primarily failures related to infrastructure are discussed. Maintenance, i. e. correcting and preventing failures, together with the track, rolling stock, weather, driver, other personnel and the timetable determine how good the punctuality will be. To the ore and steel transports studied {{it is more important to}} limit the lengths of the transport times, rather than having high punctuality, i. e. adherence to timetable. Generally, for freight transports it is difficult to give an estimation of the cost for unpunctuality. To find the root cause of a delay is vital, as is identification of symptoms and triggering events, in order to be able to carry out appropriate actions. Often the information needed to do so is lacking in the Ofelia database for infrastructure failures. Comparisons between regions or over time are complexified by the varying policies on how failure coding is to be performed. To improve punctuality by learning from others is made more difficult by e. g. different countries employing different ways of denoting punctuality. In the transport chain of post in Norway, terms related to punctuality varied even more among stakeholders. They considered being informed on estimated time of arrival as important, but getting this information was, despite this, not among the quantified goals. Few requirements were quantified, despite this often being simple to do. The consequences of failure are important to consider, not only e. g. the number of failures. Studying the variation in transport time on different line sections might help in identifying problems, because coding of delays shorter than five minutes is not carried out in the Swedish railway. Such causes of delay include low contact wire voltage, minor problems with locomotives and slippery rails due to leaves on the track. Disadvantageously, this variation is masked in the case of heavy trains or steep and curvy lines. In a studied maintenance organisation, the indicators of maintenance measured the result of the entire maintenance process. In order to manage each sub process better, it is more advantageous to measure the performance of them individually. Considering the specific sub process that decides which maintenance actions are to be carried out, it only uses expenses for the action itself when deciding, not resulting future costs and <b>punctuality.</b> The <b>indicators</b> focus on measuring past performance, not on facilitating planning for the future. A design of information systems facilitating information usage from different functions of the organisation would facilitate informed decisions. Information concerning technology, traffic and economy need to be integrated. Godkänd; 2005; 20061218 (haneit...|$|R
