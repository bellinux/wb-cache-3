A quicker stop by Rosberg saw Vettel emerge just in front of him, but the Ferrari stayed ahead and he passed Hamilton for second on lap 16.

40|$|The aim {{here was}} to define {{realistic}} load conditions for hip implants, based on in vivo contact force measurements, and to see whether current ISO standards indeed simulate real loads. The load scenarios obtained are based on in vivo hip contact forces measured in 4 patients during different activities and on activity records from 31 patients. The load scenarios {{can be adapted to}} various test purposes by applying average or high peak loads, high-impact activities or additional low-impact activities, and by simulating normal or very active patients. The most strenuous activities are walking (average <b>peak</b> <b>forces</b> 1800 N, high <b>peak</b> <b>forces</b> 3900 N), going up stairs (average <b>peak</b> <b>forces</b> 1900 N, high <b>peak</b> <b>forces</b> 4200 N) and stumbling (high <b>peak</b> <b>forces</b> 11, 000 N). Torsional moments are 50 % higher for going up stairs than for walking. Ten million loading cycles simulate an implantation time of 3. 9 years in active patients. The in vitro fatigue properties of cementless implant fixations are exceeded during stumbling. At least for heavyweight and very active subjects, the real load conditions are more critical than those defined by the ISO standards for fatigue tests...|$|R
40|$|Elasticity is a {{fundamental}} property of dynamic locomotion and is generally thought to affect the efficiency and stability of motion. In particular, {{it is becoming increasingly}} apparent that elastically-suspended loads are common in biology and useful for carrying loads.

In this paper, we present a simple model of locomotion to examine the effect of elastically-suspended loads on the <b>peak</b> <b>forces,</b> energy cost, and stability during locomotion. The results from the model show that elastically-suspended loads reduce the <b>peak</b> <b>forces,</b> energy cost, and stability of locomotion compared to rigidly-attached loads, thus indicating that a tradeoff exists between the decreased stability of locomotion and the reduction of <b>peak</b> <b>forces</b> and energy cost.

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to examine the effect of shaft {{stiffness}} on puck velocity and response characteristics of the stick during performance of a slap shot. Six elite male ice hockey players performed 6 slap shots with 4 sticks of different shaft stiffness designated as medium (13 N/m), stiff (16 N/m), extra (17 N/m) and pro stiff (19 N/m). These four levels represent the range in stiffness of sticks available to hockey players. The mechanics of the slap shot were evaluated by recording ground reaction forces and kinematics from high speed filming and a radar gun.

40|$|Mantis shrimp are {{renowned for}} their unusual method of {{breaking}} shells with brief, powerful strikes of their raptorial appendages. Due {{to the extreme}} speeds of these strikes underwater, cavitation occurs between their appendages and hard-shelled prey. Here we examine the magnitude and relative contribution of the impact and cavitation forces generated by the peacock mantis shrimp Odontodactylus scyllarus. We present the surprising finding that each strike generates two brief, high-amplitude <b>force</b> <b>peaks,</b> typically 390 - 480 mu s apart. Based on high-speed imaging, force measurements and acoustic analyses, {{it is evident that}} the first <b>force</b> <b>peak</b> is caused by the limb's impact and the second <b>force</b> <b>peak</b> is due to the collapse of cavitation bubbles. <b>Peak</b> limb impact <b>forces</b> range from 400 to 1501 N and <b>peak</b> cavitation <b>forces</b> reach 504 N. Despite their small size, O. scyllarus can generate impact forces thousands of times their body weight. Furthermore, on average, cavitation <b>peak</b> <b>forces</b> are 50 % of the limb's impact force, although cavitation forces may exceed the limb impact forces by up to 280 %. The rapid succession of high <b>peak</b> <b>forces</b> used by mantis shrimp suggests that mantis shrimp use a potent combination of cavitation forces and extraordinarily high impact forces to fracture shells. The stomatopod's hammer is fundamentally different from typical shell-crushing mechanisms such as fish jaws and lobster claws, and may have played an important and as yet unexamined role in the evolution of shell form...|$|R

This overall vehicle score was broken down into the frontal barrier crash rating of four-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), giving an overall front-impact protection rating of three-stars. A side barrier rating of five-stars for the driver (male), and two-stars for the front passenger (female), gave for an overall side-impact protection rating of three-stars. The third testing component, the rollover rating, resulted in a grading of four-stars. Subsequently, the NHTSA tested a later release of the 2011 model year Camry with enhanced safety. This resulted in an increase to the side barrier rating from two- to four-stars for the front female passenger, thus increasing the Camry's overall score to four-stars.|$|E

An exploratory and descriptive research design was used. Twelve male amateur boxers participated in this study.

The <b>peak</b> vertical <b>force,</b> <b>peak</b> horizontal braking <b>force</b> and vertical loading rate were assessed in 15 elite Australian female fast bowlers. A sequential averaging procedure indicated that a mean of twelve trials (± 2. 8) were required to achieve performance stability across these ground reaction force variables and this demonstrated the importance of analyzing {{a sufficient number of}} trials to obtain representative data. The mean peak vertical ground reaction force was 3. 49 kN (± 0. 81) and the mean <b>peak</b> horizontal braking <b>force</b> was 2. 13 kN (± 0. 52).
