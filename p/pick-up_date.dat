Unlike a typical taxi, the rider must contact the Shared Ride Taxi Service to schedule their <b>pick-up</b> <b>date</b> and time. The taxi service plans their routes {{based on the number}} of riders, pick-up/drop-off time and destination then plans the routes accordingly.|$|E

Information to be provided for this request include, but is not limited to, purchase order details (quantities, weights, and cube), commodity classifications in shipment (refer to National Motor Freight Classification 100 series), how the load (unitized methodology) is being tendered to the pick-up carrier, <b>pick-up</b> <b>date,</b> time of availability, and the applicable shipment contact details.|$|E

Mōʻiliʻili Matters played {{an active role}} in {{exploring}} the issue and collaborating with community stakeholders. After monitoring the discussion forum on illegal garbage dumping, the Founder of Mōʻiliʻili Matters collaborated with Kamehameha Schools (Mōʻiliʻili's largest landowner) to address the problem. [...] The collaboration produced an informational postcard regarding bulky item <b>pick-up</b> <b>dates</b> and guidelines [...] The postcard was mailed to more than 15,000 households.|$|R

Keith Harris of The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) wrote that by the album's release, Kelly had [...] "apparently learned from Michael Jackson's publicity mistakes, because the new Kelly was less haunted, if no less horny.

40|$|Landfill {{conservation}} {{has been}} gaining increasing priority in solid waste management, due to {{the transition from the}} use of local tip sites to more distantly located sites. The waste transfer facilities and haulage distances involved are causing waste disposal costs to increase from around 12 per tonne to 25 - 30 per tonne (Webb, 1988; Bell, 1988; Rodenburg, 1988). Waste reduction by source separation recycling has begun to be perceived as an effective means of landfill conservation, and has been implemented in local authorities throughout Australia (AEC, 1987). The introduction of 240 L mobile bins to Australian households has however been criticised as removing the incentive to householders to recycle by providing bins that are large enough to accommodate all household waste. The aim {{of the study was to}} locally determine the impact of the 240 L bins on the degree of recycling undertaken by householders and to understand the factors influencing motivation to participate in the house to house recycling scheme. The general hypothesis tested was that a convenient house-to-house recycling scheme would counteract the disincentive created by the larger capacity bins to recycle. The study has involved two methodologies: a waste volume and composition analysis of household rubbish to determine the changes caused by the introduction of mobile bins and a recycling scheme; and a questionnaire survey to determine the changes in recycling routes for materials with and without a house to house collection service. In the waste survey component of the Study, ten neighbourhoods were selected to represent a broad cross-section of socio-economic conditions within the City of Stirling, that had not yet received mobile bins or recycling bags for the first survey. The second survey was conducted randomly in the same neighbourhoods 5 - 8 months subsequent to the distribution of the bins, allowing sufficient time for householders to become accustomed to the larger bin capacity. A time constraint in the study resulted in a winter-summer waste profile. In each survey 400 randomly selected bin samples were collected and individually weighed into 16 waste categories. The questionnaire component involved random, door to door, personal interviews of householders. Time lapse since distribution of mobile bins and recycling bags was 3 - 4 weeks. The socio-economic conditions targeted for the survey were considered 'less than optimal' for recycling. Two zones of lower-middle socio-economic conditions were available for the before and after cases. An 'optimal' characterised survey zone with high socio-economic conditions was also included for comparison of recycling activity after the introduction of the mobile bins and recycling scheme with the 'less than optimal' zone. The City of Stirling house to house glass and aluminium can recycling scheme commenced with the introduction of 240 L mobile bins. The scheme involved distribution of recycling bags providing instruction for glass only on the exterior; a low intensity publicity campaign involving the recycling bags, stickers on mobile bin lids, and the separation rule indicated on mobile bin leaflets; and weekly collection, simultaneous with normal rubbish collection. Additionally the influence of the mobile bins was able to be tested on a house to house paper recycling scheme which was already established in the area and operated by a recycling company. This scheme involved: no distribution of a recycling container; a low intensity publicity campaign consisting of half yearly letterbox drops of calenders with <b>pick-up</b> <b>dates</b> marked; and an ·irregular 4 - 6 weekly collection on days other than the normal rubbish collection day. After the 3 - 4 week time lapse, a greater degree of recycling activity was found in the zones with the mobile bins and recycling scheme, considering all available routes. House to house recycling constituted the major recycling route for all glass categories without a deposit value. The degree of recycling via other routes besides the recycling scheme did not differ significantly from the "before" bins case. This indicates that the short time lapse between the distribution of the mobile bins and recycling bags had generally not permitted those with already established recycling habits to alter to the more convenient recycling route made available. Participation in the glass recycling scheme as expressed in interviews was higher in the 'optimal' zone with 67...|$|R
