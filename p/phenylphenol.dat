30|$|Though, {{this effect}} may be {{indicative}} of a stress response arising from cells exposure to high benzoate levels. In a previous transcriptomic study, Jang et al. (2008) investigated the cellular response of Staphylococcus aureus to <b>phenylphenol</b> and they observed a strong overexpression of several genes encoding ribosomal proteins after 20  min of exposure. This finding was interpreted to reflect a bacterial response to <b>phenylphenol</b> toxicity and it was argued that the upregulation of ribosomal protein genes might enhance the translation process or help proper ribosome functioning under stress conditions as the exposure to <b>phenylphenol.</b> Based on these, a similar response would be expected for P. putida F 1 exposure to benzoate considering its moderate toxicity and its structural similarities to <b>phenylphenol.</b>|$|E
40|$|Ozonation is a {{heterogeneous}} process of chemical absorption often {{controlled by a}} gas-liquid mass transfer rate. This paper {{presents the results of}} kinetics in a reaction between <b>phenylphenol</b> isomers and ozone. The degradation of <b>phenylphenol</b> isomers during ozonation proceeds quite fast. In order to avoid the influence of mass transfer limitation the kinetics experiments were conducted in a homogenous liquid-liquid system. The second-order rate constants were determined using classical and competition methods, which are especially recommended for fast reactions. The determined rate constants at pH 2 using the two different methods are almost the same. The increase of pH causes an increase of rate constants for the reaction of <b>phenylphenol</b> isomers with ozone...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} two-dimensional gas chromatography/time-of-flight {{mass spectrometry}} (GC x GC/TOFMS) method {{has been developed}} for the characterization of phenols in mainstream cigarette smoke condensate. A commercially available blend type cigarette has been investigated by using the developed method. Auto data processing by TOFMS software combined with "structured chromatogram" was used to assign the components. 250 phenols were tentatively identified including 66 alkylphenol derivatives, 47 alkenylphenol derivatives, 57 naphthalenol derivatives, 17 <b>phenylphenol</b> derivatives, 32 methoxyphenol derivatives, 9 acylphenol derivatives and 15 hydroxybenzaldehyde derivatives. The distributing profiles of different phenol derivatives in two-dimensional chromatogram were discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Methods of acid-base {{separation}} and extrography {{were used to}} decompose shale oil of Longkou oil shale (LSO), Shandong province, and coal tar of Shenmu coal (SCT), Shanxi province, both China, into acid, base and neutral fractions. The molecular structure and mass distribution of the oxygen compounds present in LSO and SCT were investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and negative-ion electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS). The results of GC-MS showed that oxygen compounds in the acid fractions of LSO and SCT were phenols, indanols, naphthols, <b>phenylphenols,</b> fluorenols and phenanthrenols, and their derivatives, while oxygen compounds in neutral fractions 4 and 5 were aliphatic ketones, esters and minor aromatic ketones. The results of ESI FT-ICR MS demonstrated that in LSO, O 1, O 2, O 3, N 1 O 1, N 1 O 2, N 1 and N 2 compounds were determined with O 1 and O 2 compounds as the most abundant. SCT contained O 1, O 2, O 3, O 4, O 5 and O 6 compounds, while O 2 and O 3 compounds dominated...|$|R
40|$|A micellar liquid chromatographic {{method to}} {{determine}} thiabendazole (TBZ) and o- <b>phenylphenol</b> in wastewater is described here. The sample was directly injected without any additional treatment other ﬁltration. The pesticides were resolved in ⬍ 11 min, us- ing a mobile phase of 0. 10 M SDS— 6 % 1 -pentanol buffered at pH 3 running through a C 18 column at 1 mL/min. The detection {{was performed by}} ﬂuorescence at 305 / 360 and 245 / 345 nm excitation/emission wavelengths for TBZ and o-phenylphenol, respectively. The method was validated following the directives of the Validation and Peer Review of U. S. Environmental Protection Agency Chemical Methods of Analysis guidelines in terms of selectivity, quantitation range (0. 01 – 0. 02 to 2 mg/L), detection limit (0. 005 – 0. 008 mg/L), trueness (92. 1 – 104. 2 %), precision (⬍ 13. 9 %), robustness (⬍ 6. 6 %), and sta- bility under storage conditions. The procedure {{was applied to the}} screening of TBZ and o-phenylphenol in wastewater samples from citrus packing plants, agricultural gutters, urban sewage, as well as in inﬂuent and efﬂuent wastewater treatment plants. This work was supported by the projects P 1 - 1 B 2012 - 36 (Uni- versitat Jaume I) and 11 I 358. 01 (FACSA) ...|$|E
