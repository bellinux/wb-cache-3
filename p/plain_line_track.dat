50|$|In June 2006 GrantRail won the {{contract}} to complete the £20 million upgrade of the Network Rail track in the Nuneaton area. This was the final conclusion of a three-stage development that began in 2002. The project was set for 24 months and required the installation of 36 new point ends of switches and crossings, the recovery and plain lining of 37 switch and crossings units, installation of significant lengths of <b>plain</b> <b>line</b> <b>track,</b> signalling mechanical installations, design and erection of 100 new overhead line (OLE) structures, and 19 km of new OLE conductors. This new upgrade would allow Network Rail to increase its line speeds and capacity enhancements between Euston and Glasgow. The project was completed in 2008.|$|E
40|$|Abrupt {{changes in}} track {{stiffness}} can occur where the ballasted track transitions from soft foundations onto bridges and viaducts, onto hard foundations and into tunnels, {{or at the}} interface between bal¬lasted track and slab track. Such interfaces between areas of different track stiff¬ness are defined as critical zones and can cause passenger discomfort, unpredictable track degradation and, potentially, track support failures. Given their nature, main¬taining critical zones is more expensive than maintaining <b>plain</b> <b>line</b> <b>track</b> and measuring and assessing the variations in track stiffness are critical activities in track main¬tenance and in ascertaining the quality of newly designed and built railways. Existing methods of track stiffness measurement are not sufficiently accurate and depen¬dable. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} research was to develop an innovative but rapid method of assessing track stiffness, so as to identify problems in transition zones. During her doctoral research, the author designed and built a sleeper deflection measurement system as a means of quickly assessing track stiffness. The laser-based digital system developed uses position sensitive detectors (PSDs) and a line laser. The performance of the new measurement system was verified on a private railway at Long Marston, which showed that the system was able to capture the displacement data of individual sleepers and thus the continuous movement of rails supported by 18 sleepers. Ob¬serving the train-induced dynamic deflection patterns across multiple sleepers allows a rapid assessment of the track stiffness and provides the information that is necessary to manage the stiffness variation around transition zones...|$|E

No public roads were crossed , {{which resulted in}} the construction of many costly bridges, tunnels, and viaducts.

Two stations on the White <b>Plains</b> <b>line</b> had four <b>tracks,</b> although express-train operation using the four-track stations did not prove to be warranted by the traffic volume.|$|R

25|$|After {{the end of}} the Civil War, {{proposals}} for new railroads reached new levels. As New York City continued to expand, many proposals were made to link The Bronx with Westchester County, hoping to capitalize on increasing real estate values. Banking that the city would continue to grow northward, the New York, Westchester and Boston Railway Company developed new lines of service to serve the large populations moving to the suburbs. Two main lines were built as part of the NYW, the Port Chester line and the White <b>Plains</b> <b>line.</b> The Port Chester Line ran along the same route as the New York Railroads New Haven line which remains in service today. The White <b>Plains</b> <b>Line</b> ran north through much of New Rochelle's rural, undeveloped upper end.|$|R
