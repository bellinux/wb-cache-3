5|$|Digital {{forensics}} {{investigations have}} a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil (as part of the electronic discovery process) courts. Forensics may also feature in the private sector; such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigation (a specialist <b>probe</b> <b>into</b> {{the nature and extent of}} an unauthorized network intrusion).|$|E
5|$|In 2007, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley {{opened a}} <b>probe</b> <b>into</b> the {{finances}} of six televangelism ministries that promoted prosperity theology: Kenneth Copeland Ministries, Creflo Dollar Ministries, Benny Hinn Ministries, Bishop Eddie Long Ministries, Joyce Meyer Ministries, and Paula White Ministries. In January 2011, Grassley concluded his investigation stating {{that he believed}} self-regulation by religious organizations was preferable to government action. Only the ministries led by Meyer and Hinn cooperated with Grassley's investigation.|$|E
5|$|Other {{means are}} also used to garner prey. Some species such as the red-naped sapsucker sally into the air to catch flying insects, and many species <b>probe</b> <b>into</b> crevices and under bark, or glean prey from leaves and twigs. The rufous {{woodpecker}} specialises in attacking the nests of arboreal ants and the buff-spotted woodpecker feeds on and nests in termite mounds. Other species such as the wrynecks and the Andean flicker feed wholly or partly on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Outside Mars, Jupiter {{was first}} visited by Pioneer 10 in 1973. More than 20 years later Galileo sent a <b>probe</b> <b>into</b> the planet's atmosphere, {{and became the}} first {{spacecraft}} to orbit the planet. Pioneer 11 became the first spacecraft to visit Saturn in 1979, with Voyager 2 making the first (and so far only) visits to Uranus and Neptune in 1986 and 1989, respectively. The first spacecraft to leave the solar system was Pioneer 10 in 1983. For a time it was the most distant spacecraft, but it has since been surpassed by both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo {{spacecraft}} was {{the first}} to have entered orbit around Jupiter, arriving in 1995 and studying the planet until 2003. During this period Galileo gathered a large amount of information about the Jovian system, making close approaches to all of the four large Galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them, as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath their surfaces. It also discovered a magnetic field around Ganymede. As it approached Jupiter, it also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9. In December 1995, it sent an atmospheric <b>probe</b> <b>into</b> the Jovian atmosphere, so far the only craft to do so.|$|E
5|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{probably}} acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can <b>probe</b> <b>into</b> a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, {{the defence}} {{argued that the}} {{proceedings}} were invalid as Knight had been granted immunity by the Attorney-General's Chambers in 1991 from further charges arising from his corruption investigations, in exchange for him to plead guilty in the earlier trial. They argued that the latest set of charges stemmed from that investigation and thus were subject to the immunity clause. The CPIB revealed {{that it had been}} tipped off about the misappropriation of money only in 1997 by an unnamed informant. The court ruled that the proceedings could continue because the 1991 <b>probe</b> <b>into</b> Knight's dealings did not investigate his misappropriation of money. Eventually the court found him guilty of two charges of misappropriation and sentenced him to a $10,000 fine and another day in jail.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{counter-terrorism}} agency NCTb {{said that}} it had started a <b>probe</b> <b>into</b> where the suspect originated. Dutch officials also said that they will now use 3D full-body scanning X-ray technology on flights departing to the U.S., despite protests from privacy advocates. Dutch officials said that security must take priority over {{the privacy of the}} individuals being scanned, but the scanners are not designed to compromise an individual's privacy, as the imagery resolution is only high enough to detect non-metallic objects under clothing, such as powdered explosives. Members of the Second Chamber (Lower House) of the Dutch parliament demanded an explanation from Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin, asking how the suspect managed to smuggle explosives on board, despite Schiphol's reportedly strict security measures.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also <b>probe</b> <b>into</b> the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E

5|$|The Australian magpie is omnivorous, eating various items {{located at}} or near ground level {{including}} invertebrates such as earthworms, millipedes, snails, spiders and scorpions {{as well as a}} wide variety of insects—cockroaches, ants, beetles, moths and caterpillars and other larvae. Insects, including large adult grasshoppers, may be seized mid-flight. Skinks, frogs, mice and other small animals as well as grain, tubers, figs and walnuts have also been noted as components of their diet. It has even learnt to safely eat the poisonous cane toad by flipping it over and consuming the underparts. Predominantly a ground feeder, the Australian magpie paces open areas methodically searching for insects and their larvae. One study showed birds were able to find scarab beetle larvae by sound or vibration. Birds use their bills to <b>probe</b> <b>into</b> the earth or otherwise overturn debris in search of food. Smaller prey are swallowed whole, although magpies rub off the stingers of bees and wasps before swallowing.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} this tragedy, {{workers in the}} unorganized leather {{industry}} of Topsia area held protest rallies demanding compensation for the relatives of the deceased workers, better working conditions and a <b>probe</b> <b>into</b> the fire mishap. The mayor of Kolkata convened an all-party meeting to discuss the incident and also promised to initiate a drive demolish illegal constructions in the area. The labour inspectors inspected the building and declared the factory as illegal. Even though the building was declared illegal and unsafe, a month later, the police raided the house and found that another leather factory was operating behind closed doors in {{the ground floor of}} the building. The civic officials issued a notice to stop any work in the building. Though local residents alleged that clandestine work started in the building with the help of local MLA, Javen Khan, Khan himself blamed it rather on the police.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo orbiter, which went into orbit around Jupiter on December 7, 1995. It orbited the planet for over seven years, making 35 orbits {{before it was}} destroyed during a controlled impact with Jupiter on September 21, 2003. During this period, it gathered {{a large amount of}} information about the Jovian system; the amount of information was not as great as intended because the deployment of its high-gain radio transmitting antenna failed. The major events during the eight-year study included multiple flybys of all of the Galilean moons, as well as Amalthea (the first probe to do so). It also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 as it approached Jupiter in 1994 and the sending of an atmospheric <b>probe</b> <b>into</b> the Jovian atmosphere in December 1995.|$|E
