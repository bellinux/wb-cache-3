5|$|The film {{concerns}} a middle-aged railway <b>pointsman,</b> Maloin (Miroslav Krobot), {{who lives in}} a decrepit apartment in a port town with his highly-strung wife Camélia (Tilda Swinton) and his daughter Henriette (Erika Bók). One night while in his viewing tower at the port's rail terminus, Maloin witnesses a fight on the dockside. One of the shady combatants is knocked into the water along with the briefcase he carries; when the other flees the dark quayside, Maloin makes a clandestine descent from the tower and retrieves the briefcase, which he finds full of sodden English banknotes. Maloin conceals the money and tells no-one of what he has seen. The next morning, he visits a tavern where he plays chess with the barkeep (Gyula Pauer). On his way home, he stops by the butcher's where his daughter works, and finds to his indignation that they have her washing the floor. Later, from the window of his apartment, he notices Brown (János Derzsi) watching him from below. At dinner, Maloin is increasingly irascible, addressing Henriette brusquely and arguing with Camélia. Meanwhile, Brown searches the water at the dock's edge without success before noticing the watchtower overlooking the quayside, and Maloin within.|$|E

60|$|Will Garvie was a <b>pointsman</b> now. On {{recovering}} from his prolonged illness, {{during which he}} had been supported out of the Provident Fund of the railway--to which he and all the other men on the line contributed-- he was put to light work at first at the station of Clatterby. By degrees his strength returned, and he displayed so much intelligence, and such calmness of nerve and coolness of courage, that he was made a <b>pointsman</b> at the station, and had a sentry-box sort of erection, with windows all round it, apportioned to his daily use. There he was continually employed in shifting the points for the shunting of trains, none of which dared to move, despite their mighty power and impatience, until Will Garvie gave them leave.|$|E
60|$|It was a Junction-Station, {{where the}} wooden razors before {{mentioned}} shaved the air very often, {{and where the}} sharp electric-telegraph bell was in a very restless condition. All manner of cross-lines of rails came zig-zagging into it, like a Congress of iron vipers; and, a little way out of it, a <b>pointsman</b> in an elevated signal-box was constantly {{going through the motions}} of drawing immense quantities of beer at a public-house bar. In one direction, confused perspectives of embankments and arches were to be seen from the platform; in the other, the rails soon disentangled themselves into two tracks and shot away under a bridge, and curved round a corner. Sidings were there, in which empty luggage-vans and cattle-boxes often butted against each other as if they couldn't agree; and warehouses were there, in which great quantities of goods seemed to have taken the veil (of the consistency of tarpaulin), and to have retired from the world without any hope of getting back to it. Refreshment-rooms were there; one, for the hungry and thirsty Iron Locomotives where their coke and water were ready, and of good quality, for they were dangerous to play tricks with; the other, for the hungry and thirsty human Locomotives, who might take what they could get, and whose chief consolation was provided in the form of three terrific urns or vases of white metal, containing nothing, each forming a breastwork for a defiant and apparently much-injured woman.|$|E
50|$|The NUR was an {{industrial}} union founded in 1913 by {{the merger of}} the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants (founded 1872), the United <b>Pointsmen</b> and Signalmen's Society (founded 1880) and the General Railway Workers' Union (founded 1889).|$|R

You see that <b>pointsman!</b> They say he's an old mutineer, and when he relaxes he boasts of the Sahibs he has killed. He's glad enough to eat the Company's salt now." [...] Such a withered old face was the face of the <b>pointsman</b> at No. 11 point! The information suggested a host of questions, and the answers were these: [...] "You won't be able to understand till you've been down into a mine. We work our men in two ways: some by direct payment--under our own hand, and some by contractors. The contractor undertakes to deliver us the coal, supplying his own men, tools, and props. He's responsible for the safety of his men, and of course the Company knows and sees his work. Just fancy, among these five thousand people, what sort of effect the news of an accident would produce! It would go all through the Sonthal Parganas. We have any amount of Sonthals besides Mahometans and Hindus of every possible caste, down to those Musahers who eat pig. They don't require much administering in the civilian sense of the word. On Sundays, as a rule, if any man has had his daughter eloped with, or anything of that kind, he generally comes up to the manager's bungalow to get the matter put straight. If a man is disabled through accident he knows that as long as he's in the hospital he gets full wages, and the Company pays for the food of any of his women-folk who come to look after him. One, of course; not the whole clan. That makes our service popular with the people. Don't you believe that a native is a fool. You can train him to everything except responsibility. There's a rule in the workings that if there is any dangerous work--we haven't choke-damp; I will show you when we get down--no gang must work without an Englishman to look after them. A native wouldn't be wise enough to understand what the danger was, or where it came in. Even if he did, he'd shirk the responsibility. We can't afford to risk a single life. All our output is just as much as the Company want--about a thousand tons per working day. Three hundred thousand in the year. We could turn out more? Yes--a little. Well, yes, twice as much. I won't go on, because you wouldn't believe me. There's the coal under us, and we work it at any depth from following up an outcrop down to six hundred feet. That is our deepest shaft. We have no necessity to go deeper. At home the mines are sometimes fifteen hundred feet down. Well, the thickness of this coal here varies from anything you please to anything you please. There's enough of it to last your time and one or two hundred years longer. Perhaps even longer than that. Look at that stuff. That's big coal from the pit." ...|$|E
60|$|Will Garvie, who {{was putting}} a {{finishing}} drop of oil into {{some part of}} the machinery, took his station beside his mate and eased off the brake. John let off two sharp whistles (an imperative duty on the part of every driver before starting an engine) and let on the steam. The first was a very soft pulsation--a mere puff--but it was enough to move the ponderous engine {{as if it had been}} a cork, though its actual weight with tender was fifty-three tons. Another puff, and slowly the iron horse moved out of its stable. There was a gentle, oily, gliding, effect connected with its first movements that might have won the confidence even of timid Mrs Captain Tipps. Another puff of greater strength shot the engine forward with a sudden grandeur of action that would certainly have sent that lady's heart into her throat. In a few seconds it reached and passed the place where the siding was connected with the main line, and where a <b>pointsman</b> stood ready to shift the points. Here the obedient spirit of the powerful steed was finely displayed. Will Garvie reversed the action of the engines by a process which, though beautifully simple and easily done, cannot be easily described. John let on a puff of steam, and the engine glided backwards as readily as it had run forward. A few seconds afterwards it moved slowly under the magnificent arch of Clatterby station, and its buffers met those of the train it was destined to draw as if with a gentle touch of friendly greeting.|$|E
60|$|First, {{as to its}} contrasts. They {{were only}} two, but they were Lethargy and Madness. The Station was either totally {{unconscious}}, or wildly raving. By day, in its unconscious state, {{it looked as if}} no life could come to it,--as if it were all rust, dust, and ashes--as if the last train for ever, had gone without issuing any Return-Tickets--as if the last Engine had uttered its last shriek and burst. One awkward shave of the air from the wooden razor, and everything changed. Tight office-doors flew open, panels yielded, books, newspapers, travelling-caps and wrappers broke out of brick walls, money chinked, conveyances oppressed by nightmares of luggage came careering into the yard, porters started up from secret places, ditto the much-injured women, the shining bell, who lived in a little tray on stilts by himself, flew into a man's hand and clamoured violently. The <b>pointsman</b> aloft in the signal-box made the motions of drawing, with some difficulty, hogsheads of beer. Down Train! More bear! Up Train! More beer. Cross junction Train! More beer! Cattle Train! More beer. Goods Train! Simmering, whistling, trembling, rumbling, thundering. Trains on the whole confusion of intersecting rails, crossing one another, bumping one another, hissing one another, backing to go forward, tearing into distance to come close. People frantic. Exiles seeking restoration to their native carriages, and banished to remoter climes. More beer and more bell. Then, in a minute, the Station relapsed into stupor as the stoker of the Cattle Train, the last to depart, went gliding out of it, wiping the long nose of his oil-can with a dirty pocket-handkerchief.|$|E
50|$|On 29 June 1867, a {{passenger}} train {{ran into the}} rear of a coal train at Warrington, Cheshire due to a <b>pointsmans</b> error which was compounded {{by the lack of}} interlocking between points and signals. Eight people were killed and 33 were injured.|$|R
50|$|After October Revolution {{semi-automatic}} {{block system}} {{was brought in}} at Vertunovskaya station, railway tracks were reconstructed. Since sugar factory (Sakhzavod) was gone into operation in 1933-1934, density of freight traffic grew. Railwaymen contributed greatly to victory in Second World War (1945). Railroad engineers Aleksandr Nikitovich Shchavelev and Dmitriy Ivanovich Tarantin, who were born in Sosnovka, fell in pursuance of military missions. There was large goods traffic on railroad, but railwaymen handled a task. After Second World War density of freight traffic grew. Number of railway tracks was increased on the station, from three to six. All-electric interlocking was introduced (it cancelled work of <b>pointsmen)</b> and radio communication with railroad engineers.|$|R
5000|$|The strike {{arose from}} {{widespread}} {{dissatisfaction with the}} activities of the so-called [...] "conciliation boards" [...] which had been set up to negotiate between workers and rail companies. A series of local disputes led to unofficial action in July and early August 1911. A meeting of the main rail unions was arranged in Liverpool to coordinate action nationally. Delegates were from the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF), The Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants (ASRS), the General Railway Workers' Union (GRWU) and the United <b>Pointsmen</b> and Signalmen's Society (UPSS). The unions issued an ultimatum to the rail companies to accept direct negotiation with their representatives within 24 hours or a national strike would be called.|$|R

50|$|Debaltseve {{city was}} founded in 1878 as a railway station due to the {{construction}} of the Catherine railway (special government railway of Russian empire built in 1882-1904). Though at that time this station was well-equipped, it had a number of disadvantages: lack of office buildings, nowhere to place inspectors, a railway hospital was a room with eight beds in a paramedic’s apartment. On December 1, 1878 regular train traffic commenced at the Donetsk coal line. The station has been built by landless peasants and poor people from surrounding villages. By 1897, 2048 people inhabited the village close by the railway station. From November 25 to November 27, 1898 a first strike at the station took place. 60 <b>pointsmen</b> were not working demanding reduction of a 16-hour duty shift.|$|R
50|$|On 12 September 1870 in Barnsley top yard a rake of 10 {{goods wagons}} was {{standing}} on a gradient of 1 in 119. A single sprag between the spokes of a wheel was holding them. When two gas tank wagons were shunted against the rake, the sprag broke and the 12 wagons began to move. Two <b>pointsmen</b> made valiant efforts to pin down the brakes to no avail. The wagons rapidly gathered speed as the gradient increased to 1 in 72 and passed three signal boxes, none of which had points under their control to deflect the runaways. Meanwhile, a passenger train which had left Barnsley at 18:15 was standing at Stairfoot station {{one and a half}} miles away. The runaways struck the rear of the standing train at a speed of at least 40 mph, killing 15 and injuring 59 more.|$|R
60|$|As {{the line}} grew longer, native {{officers}} and non-commissioned {{officers from the}} active and reserve lists of the Egyptian Army were appointed station-masters. Intelligent non-commissioned officers and men were converted into shunters, guards, and <b>pointsmen.</b> Traffic was controlled by telephone. To work the telephone, men were discovered who could read and write--very often who could read and write only their own names, and even that with such difficulty that they usually preferred a seal. They developed into clerks by a simple process of selection. To improve their education, and to train a staff in the office work of a railway, two schools were instituted at Halfa. In these establishments, which were formed by the shade of two palm-trees, twenty pupils received the beginnings of knowledge. The simplicity of the instruction was aided by the zeal of the students, and learning grew beneath the palm-trees more quickly perhaps than in the magnificent schools of civilisation.|$|R

In March 1957 the mare made her first attempt to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup and started the 6/1 joint favourite with <b>Pointsman.</b> Ridden by George Milburn she tracked the leaders before moving up to join the leaders at the third last. The race appeared to lie between Linwell, Kerstin and <b>Pointsman</b> before the mare sprawled on landing at the second last, badly hampering Pointman.

5000|$|In early 2009 an {{overhaul}} of the technical infrastructure was completed. In addition to rectifying shortcomings on the running line which had become increasingly urgent since the 1990s, the station was given an automatic train detection system (automatische Gleisfreimeldeanlage) and new colour light signals. One of the two signal boxes became redundant as a result. The train director (Fahrdienstleiter) (signal box [...] "Vf") is now based in the former pointsmen's signal box [...] "Vo". The hand-operated level crossing and the semaphore signals at the eastern exit to the station had to remain, because the Federal Railway Office (EBA) would only authorise a full upgrade of the station with the latest technology (the electronic signal box, ESTW). But {{there is no way to}} do this. The Class Dr S2 signalling technology that replaces <b>pointsmen</b> dates from the 1950s. The upgrade is an EBA-mandated emergency measure to resolve urgent safety issues that is needed to keep the line open. In previous years the EBA had repeatedly threatened the DB AG with a complete ban on operations on the Langwedel-Soltau route due to its clapped out infrastructure.|$|R
60|$|The Englishman took a {{train from}} Ajmir to Marwar Junction, {{which is on}} the road to Mount Abu, westward from Ajmir, and at five in the morning, under pale moonlight, was uncarted at the {{beginning}} of the Jodhpur State Railway--one of the quaintest little lines that ever ran a locomotive. It is the Maharaja's very own, and pays about ten per cent; but its quaintness does not lie in these things. It is worked with rude economy, and started life by singularly and completely falsifying the Government estimates for its construction. An intelligent bureau asserted that it could not be laid down for less than--but the error shall be glossed over. It was laid down for a little more than seventeen thousand rupees a mile, with the help of second-hand rails and sleepers; and it is currently asserted that the Station-masters are flagmen, <b>pointsmen,</b> ticket-collectors, and everything else, except platforms, and lamp-rooms. As only two trains are run in the twenty-four hours, this economy of staff does not matter. The State line, with the comparatively new branch to the Pachpadra salt-pits, pays handsomely and is exactly suited to the needs of its users. True, there is a certain haziness as to the hour of starting, but this allows laggards more time, and fills the packed carriages to overflowing.|$|R
6000|$|This {{process of}} shunting, we may explain {{for the benefit}} of those who don't know, {{consists}} in detaching trucks from trains of goods and shoving them into sidings, so that they may be out of the way, until their time comes to be attached to other trains, which will convey them to their proper destination, or to have their contents, if need be, unloaded and distributed among other trucks. Shunting is sometimes a tedious process, involving much hauling, pushing, puffing, and whistling, {{on the part of the}} engine, and uncoupling of trucks and shifting of points on the part of <b>pointsmen</b> and porters. There is considerable danger, too, in the process,--or rather there was danger before the introduction of the [...] "block system," [...] which now, when it is adopted, renders accidents almost impossible,--of which system more shall be said hereafter. The danger lies in this, that shunting has frequently to be done during intervals between the passing of passenger-trains, and, on lines where passenger and goods traffic is very great, these intervals are sometimes extremely brief. But, strange to say, this danger is the mother of safety, for the difficulty of conducting extensive traffic is so great, that a combination of all but perfect systems of signalling, telegraphing, and organisation is absolutely needful to prevent constant mishap. Hence the marvellous result that, in the midst of danger, we are in safety, and travelling by railway is really less dangerous than travelling by stage-coach used to be in days of old. Yes, timid reader, we assure you that if you travel daily by rail your chances of coming to grief are very much fewer than if you were to travel daily by mail coach. Facts and figures prove this beyond all doubt, so that we are entitled to take the comfort of it. The marvel is, not that loss of life is so great, but that it is so small.|$|R
50|$|In late 1956 Linwell {{established}} himself as a leading Gold Cup contender with a win over Kerstin. In his final prep race for the Cheltenham race he was beaten by <b>Pointsman</b> in a race at Kempton Park Racecourse but ran well on a course which did not suit him. The 30th running of the Gold Cup, which took place on soft ground on 14 March 1957, looked to be a very open race with Kerstin and <b>Pointsman</b> being made the 6/1 joint favourites and Linwell, ridden as usual by Scudamore starting at 100/9. The other leading contenders in the thirteen-runner field were E.S.B., Sir Ken (a three-time winner of the Champion Hurdle), Gay Donald and Rose Park (King George VI Chase). Scudamore restrained Linwell towards the rear of the field as Rose Park set the pace before moving up to join the leaders approaching the straight. With Rose Park fading, the race appeared to lie between Linwell, Kerstin and <b>Pointsman</b> on the final turn. At the penultimate obstacle the mare made a bad mistake, badly hampering Pointman and handing the advantage to Linwell who jumped the last a length in front. Linwell stayed on strongly up the run-in to win by a length from Kerstin with Rose Park five lengths back in third.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 31 st Annual Southern African Transport Conference 9 - 12 July 2012 "Getting Southern Africa to Work", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Southern Africa faces many challenges, amongst others unemployment and road deaths, {{almost half of the}} road fatalities being pedestrians. Innovative solutions for solving road safety (and especially pedestrian safety) challenges in our rural communities can be achieved by involving the local community in the solution. This should be done {{in such a way that}} the local community members actively participate in road safety and particularly pedestrian safety education. Training is one way of achieving this goal. The experience in labour intensive construction infrastructure provision in rural and urban communities can be applied in community pedestrian safety projects. This paper will indicate how facilitating the forming of a steering committee (representing the local community, local school, SAPS, Traffic), implementing authorities (municipal, provincial, toll concessionaire), implementing agent (consultants, project managers) and training in this case a community safety/pedestrian officer, (instead of the usual community liaison officer) who can implement the community pedestrian project can be used to enhance existing road safety education in schools. The added advantages of such projects includes the creation of creating sustainable jobs, meaningful employment and sustained road safety awareness in communities, empowerment of local communities, involvement and buy-in of communities at large. Private enterprises involved in these road safety initiatives have the added advantage of funding such projects with Corporate Social Investment funding, with significant benefits for such companies. Other examples of innovative road safety projects that create employment will also be discussed. Specifically the for example the <b>pointsmen</b> that an insurance company has placed at intersections during peak traffic to assist with traffic flow and improved road safety.

Had the money spent in local mistakes and vain private litigation, on the railroads of England, been laid out, instead, under proper government restraint, on really useful railroad work, and had no absurd expense been incurred in ornamenting stations, we might already have had,--what ultimately will be found we must have,--quadruple rails, two for passengers, and two for traffic, on every great line; and we might have been carried in swift safety, and watched and warded by well-paid <b>pointsmen,</b> for half the present fares. [...] "[Greek: hô Dêmidion, horas ta lagô' ha soi pherô]?" [...] Suppose it should turn out, finally, that a true government set to true work, instead of being a costly engine, was a paying one? that your government, rightly organized, instead of itself subsisting by an income tax, would produce its subjects some subsistence in the shape of an income dividend!--police and judges duly paid besides, only with less work than the state at present provides for them.|$|R
