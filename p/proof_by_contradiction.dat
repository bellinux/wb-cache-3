5|$|Archimedes {{was able}} to use infinitesimals {{in a way that is}} similar to modern {{integral}} calculus. Through <b>proof</b> <b>by</b> <b>contradiction</b> (reductio ad absurdum), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the method of exhaustion, and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In Measurement of a Circle he did this by drawing a larger regular hexagon outside a circle and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he {{was able to}} determine that the value of π lay between 3 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the area of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle (πr2). In On the Sphere and Cylinder, Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the Archimedean property of real numbers.|$|E
5|$|For example, Avicenna gives a {{philosophical}} {{justification for the}} Islamic doctrine of tawhid (oneness of God) by showing the uniqueness and simplicity of the necessary existent. He argues that the necessary existent must be unique, using a <b>proof</b> <b>by</b> <b>contradiction,</b> or reductio, showing that a contradiction would follow if one supposes {{that there were more}} than one necessary existent. If one postulates two necessary existents, A and B, a simplified version of the argument considers two possibilities: if A is distinct from B as a result of something implied from necessity of existence, then B would share it, too (being a necessary existent itself), and the two are not distinct after all. If, on the other hand, the distinction resulted from something not implied by necessity of existence, then this individuating factor will be a cause for A, and this means that A has a cause and is not a necessary existent after all. Either way, the opposite proposition resulted in contradiction, which to Avicenna proves the correctness of the argument. Avicenna argued that the necessary existent must be simple (not a composite) by a similar reductio strategy. If it were a composite, its internal parts would need a feature that distinguishes each from the others. The distinguishing feature cannot be solely derived from the parts' necessity of existence, because then they would both have the same feature and not be distinct: a contradiction. But it also cannot be accidental, or requiring an outside cause, because this would contradict its necessity of existence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The study {{presented}} in this report {{is part of a}} wide research project♣ concerning <b>proofs</b> <b>by</b> <b>contradiction.</b> Starting from the notion of mathematical theorem as the unity of statement, proof and theory, a structural analysis of <b>proofs</b> <b>by</b> <b>contradiction</b> has been carried out, producing a model {{to be used in the}} observation, analysis, and interpretation of cognitive and didactical issues related to this particular type of proof. In particular, the model highlights the complex relationship between the original statement to be proved and a new statement (the secondary statement) that is actually proved. Through the analysis of an exemplar protocol, this paper discusses on cognitive difficulties concerning the relationship between the reference theory and the proof of the secondary statement...|$|R

40|$|We {{would like}} to report an error in a <b>proof</b> given <b>by</b> J. -P. Verjus in [3]. More importantly, we {{would like to}} point out a {{difference}} between the notions 2 ̆ 2 always-true 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 invariant 2 ̆ 2, which are identified in [3]. In his paper, Verjus claims that invariance <b>proofs</b> <b>by</b> <b>contradiction</b> are shorter than invariance <b>proofs</b> <b>by</b> the established method, called the 2 ̆ 2 induction method 2 ̆ 2 in [3]. To illustrate his idea, he proposes an alternative correctness proof for a termination detection algorithm given by Dijkstra, Feijen, and Van Gasteren [2]. We show that his—operational—proof is incorrect and incomplete (Section 1); moreover, what he shows is that a predicate is always-true, which is strictly weaker than invariance (Section 2). Instead of illustrating the merits of <b>proofs</b> <b>by</b> <b>contradiction,</b> the <b>proof</b> strongly supports our opinion that operational arguments should be avoided...|$|R

25|$|One {{proof of}} the number's irrationality is the {{following}} proof by infinite descent.

25|$|For {{at least}} a {{thousand}} years, geometers were troubled by the disparate complexity of the fifth postulate, and believed it could be proved as a theorem from the other four. Many attempted to find a <b>proof</b> <b>by</b> <b>contradiction,</b> including Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 11th century), Omar Khayyám (12th century), Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī (13th century), and Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri (18th century).|$|E

25|$|On December 7, Cantor sent Dedekind a <b>proof</b> <b>by</b> <b>contradiction</b> {{that the}} set of real numbers is uncountable. Cantor starts by {{assuming}} the real numbers can be written as a sequence. Then he applies a construction to this sequence to produce a real number not in the sequence, thus contradicting his assumption. The letters of December 2 and 7 lead to a non-constructive proof {{of the existence of}} transcendental numbers.|$|E
25|$|Like intuitionism, constructivism {{involves}} the regulative principle that only mathematical entities {{which can be}} explicitly constructed {{in a certain sense}} should be admitted to mathematical discourse. In this view, mathematics is an exercise of the human intuition, not a game played with meaningless symbols. Instead, it is about entities that we can create directly through mental activity. In addition, some adherents of these schools reject non-constructive proofs, such as a <b>proof</b> <b>by</b> <b>contradiction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Euclid {{often used}} <b>proof</b> <b>by</b> <b>contradiction.</b> Euclidean {{geometry}} also allows {{the method of}} superposition, in which a figure is transferred to another point in space. For example, proposition I.4, side-angle-side congruence of triangles, is proved by moving {{one of the two}} triangles so that one of its sides coincides with the other triangle's equal side, and then proving that the other sides coincide as well. Some modern treatments add a sixth postulate, the rigidity of the triangle, which can be used as an alternative to superposition.|$|E

25|$|A {{major force}} behind {{intuitionism}} was L.E.J. Brouwer, who rejected {{the usefulness of}} formalized logic of any sort for mathematics. His student Arend Heyting postulated an intuitionistic logic, different from the classical Aristotelian logic; this logic does not contain {{the law of the}} excluded middle and therefore frowns upon <b>proofs</b> <b>by</b> <b>contradiction.</b> The axiom of choice is also rejected in most intuitionistic set theories, though in some versions it is accepted. Important work was later done by Errett Bishop, who managed to prove versions of the most important theorems in real analysis within this framework.|$|R
