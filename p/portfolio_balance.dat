Loan <b>portfolio</b> <b>balances</b> managed by the FSA for the Federal Family Education Loan Program are slowly and steadily shrinking as new loans offered to students by the U.S. Department of Education originate under the FDSL program. Most of the growth in FDSL loan <b>portfolio</b> <b>balances</b> can be attributed to new loan originations, while being the sole government program for student loans. Another contributor to the rapid escalation in loan balances is due to the cost of higher education increasing rapidly, faster than inflation. Students are spending and borrowing more to finance their higher-priced, higher education.|$|R

By definition, the sterilized intervention {{has little or no}} effect on domestic interest rates, since the level of the money supply has remained constant.

Thus, these actions to balance portfolios will influence exchange rates.|$|E

50|$|Value {{averaging}}, {{also known}} as dollar value averaging (DVA), is a technique of adding to an investment portfolio {{with the objective of}} providing a greater return than similar methods such as dollar cost averaging and random investment. It was developed by former Harvard University professor Michael E. Edleson. Value averaging is a formula-based investment technique where a mathematical formula is used to guide the investment of money into a portfolio over time. With the method, investors contribute to their portfolios {{in such a way that}} the <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> increases by a set amount, regardless of market fluctuations. As a result, in periods of market declines, the investor contributes more, while in periods of market climbs, the investor contributes less. In contrast to dollar cost averaging which mandates that a fixed amount of money be invested at each period, the value averaging investor may actually be required to withdraw from the portfolio in some periods.|$|E
40|$|This study {{employs the}} cointegrating VAR {{approach}} to characterise {{the relationships between}} the five exchange rates comprising the TWI and the share market in New Zealand. Weekly data covering January 1999 to June 2006 are analysed. The study discovers {{there are two types of}} long-run relationship mimicking the <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> and goods market theories. That implies there is bi-directional causality in the foreign exchange and stock markets in both the short run and long run although different exchange rates may be implicated. In the long run, the empirical results for the relationship between the NZ-US dollar exchange rate and the overall share market index support both the <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> and goods market theories. In the short run, the <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> theory is further supported by all the exchange rates but the goods market theory is supported significantly only by the NZ-Australian dollar exchange rate. Thus the evidence is predominantly in support of the <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> theory and that the firms most at risk of foreign exchange rate exposure are those that export to Australia. ...|$|E
40|$|I {{analyze the}} recent {{experience}} of unconventional monetary policy in Sweden {{to study the}} interest rate transmission mechanisms of government bond purchases when interest rates are not constrained by a lower bound. Using dynamic term structure models and event study regressions I find that government bond purchases have important <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> and signaling effects. The signaling channel operates mainly by lowering short-rate expectations in the intermediate segment of the yield curve, while the <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> channel is effective in lowering longer maturity term premia. In addition, I find that target interest rate policy and government bond purchases operate in different segments of the yield curve. This suggests {{that a combination of}} the two policies can be used to lower interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum, making monetary policy more expansionary. quantitative easing; signaling channel; <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> channel; yield curve; dynamic affine term structure models; short rate expectations; term premiu...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{international}} spillover effects of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) using a two-country dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model with nominal and real rigidities, and <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> effects. <b>Portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> effects arise from imperfect substitution between short- and long-term bond portfolios in each country, {{as well as}} between domestic and foreign bonds within these portfolios. We show that LSAPs lower both domestic and foreign long-term yields, and stimulate economic activity in both countries. International spillover effects become larger as the steady-state share of long-term U. S. bond holdings increases in the rest-of-the-world portfolio, as the elasticity of substitution between short- and long-term bonds decreases, or as the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign bonds increases. We also find that U. S. asset purchases that generate the same output effect as U. S. conventional monetary policy have larger international spillover effects. This is because <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> effects appear to be stronger under unconventional policy, and foreigners' U. S. bond holdings are heavily weighted toward long-term bonds...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has emphasized the <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> effects of Federal Reserve bond purchases, {{in which a}} reduced bond supply lowers term premia. In contrast, we find that such purchases have important signaling effects that lower expected future short term interest rates.

To overcome problems in measuring term premia, we consider unbiased model estimation and restricted risk price estimation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to examine whether a gender equal board of directors {{have an impact on}} the equity performance during the examination period of December 2011 to December 2016. This study shows that the gender <b>balanced</b> <b>portfolio</b> outperforms the non-gender <b>balanced</b> <b>portfolio</b> in all investigated performance measures. The portfolios used in this thesis consists of firms listed on the Swedish stock market which have been classified due to their representation of women on the board. The portfolios are compared and analyzed using the Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, Jensen’s alpha and Appraisal Ratio. The result implies that a gender equal board improves the equity performance of a company. A regression analysis further implies that the performance of the gender <b>balanced</b> <b>portfolio</b> can not be explained by market movements contrary to the non-gender <b>balanced</b> <b>portfolio.</b> In other words, there must be other factors affecting the performance of the gender <b>balanced</b> <b>portfolio.</b> The main difference between the two portfolios is the share of women on the board which implies that this is one of the strengthening factors.

40|$|We {{argue that}} the {{issuance}} of central bank reserves per se can matter for the effect of central bank large-scale asset purchases—commonly known as quantitative easing— on long-term interest rates. This effect is independent of the assets purchased, and runs through a reserve-induced <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> channel. For evidence we analyze the reaction of Swiss long-term government bond yields to announcements by the Swiss National Bank to expand central bank reserves without acquiring any long-lived securities. We find that declines in long-term yields following the announcements mainly reflected reduced term premiums suggestive of reserve-induced <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> effects.

We show that expansionary monetary policy causes exchange rate overshooting, not once, but twice; the secondary repercussion comes through the reaction of firms to changed asset prices and the firms ’ decisions to invest in real capital. The model sheds further light on the volatility of real and nominal exchange rates, and it suggests that changes in corporate sector profitability may affect exchange rates through portfolio diversification in corporate securities.

40|$|With its {{interest}} rate instrument at the zero lower bound, the Federal Reserve {{has turned to}} unconventional methods {{in an attempt to}} stimulate economic growth and raise employment. Prominent among these is quantitative easing (QE) —the purchase of a large quantity of longerterm debt. Policymakers and analysts have argued that QE works by reducing the risk premium that investors require to hold longer-dated securities. I present several reasons to question the theoretical foundations of the so-called <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> channel and offer several arguments for why the effect might be relatively small even if it is theoretically valid. Consistent with these arguments, an empirical analysis with a variety of interest rate and quantity measures used in the literature finds essentially no support for the <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> channel...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{quantitative}} easing (QE) in a small open economy dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model with international <b>portfolio</b> <b>balancing.</b> <b>Portfolios</b> are classified as imperfectly substitutable short-term and long-term subportfolios, each including domestic and foreign bonds. Unlike in standard small open economy models, both domestic and foreign bonds may be traded internationally. The model links the domestic term premium to the global term premium, and the implication of the model {{on the effectiveness of}} QE policies in reducing the domestic term premium depends crucially on the degree of substitutability between domestic and foreign bonds. The estimated model implies that QE in small open economies is expected to be much less effective on long-term yields because of the high substitutability between home and foreign assets found in the data. In the model, this causes the effect on the exchange rate to be limited. The paper also shows that foreign investors' access to the domestic debt market is essential when evaluating the QE policy; ignoring foreign investors' access would mistakenly make the policy look more effective...|$|R

40|$|The {{past fifteen}} years has {{witnessed}} a thorough reconsideration {{of the theory of}} international capital flows and monetary policy in open economies. Much of this work is based on the concept of <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> and stock-flow equilibrium. The present paper develops a tractable way of incorporating <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> into a modified IS-LM model, thereby bringing the much-used framework into line with modern thinking about financial equilibrium under foxed exchange rates. In so doing, the interrelationship between monetary and exchange-market intervention policies is emphasized. This permits a consistent treatment of short-run financial market equilibrium and balance of payments considerations. To illustrate the usefulness of the resulting "IS-PB" model, a balanced-budget increase in givernment expenditure is examined under alternative monetary stances consistent with the fixed exchange rate. The scant treatment of fiscal policy (relative to monetary and exchange rate policies) in the open-economy <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> literature is thereby partially remedied. A second application considers the effects of foreign interest rate shocks. The model accurately captures the policy choices facing countries attempting to maintain fixed exchange rates during 1981 when U. S. interest rates were forced up dramatically in an effort to bring inflation under control. Published in connection with a visit at the IIE...|$|E
40|$|This paper applies a {{new method}} to {{investigate}} the foreign exchange risk premium. The method is new {{in the sense that}} it utilizes the time-varying second moment expectations implied by foreign currency option pricing. The vast empirical literature on the risk premium generally neglects the role of time-varying second moments, in spite of their importance in assessing risk-return tradeoffs. In fact, this importance is borne out in the data: time-varying expectations generate valuable new evidence regarding both unbiasedness in the forward rate and <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> models. Moreover, the results suggest that previous tests which assume constant second moments involve serious misspecification errors. The results also highlight the unreliability of the <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> effects of sterilized intervention, in spite of the quantitative importance of expected return differentials.
