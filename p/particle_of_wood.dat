So a new school was built, and the ramshackle little academy that had done good service in its day was closed for the last time. For years it had been without a lock; ever since a blatter of wind and rain drove the door against the fireplace. After that it was the dominie's custom, on seeing the room cleared, to send in a smart boy--a dux was always chosen--who wedged a clod of earth or peat between doorpost and door. Thus the school was locked up for the night. The boy came out by the window, where he entered to open the door next morning. In time grass hid the little path from view that led to the old school, and a dozen years ago every <b>particle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> about the building, including the door and the framework of the windows, had been burned by travelling tinkers.|$|E

The carpenters were approaching the completion of their work. The new English room was completed, the library room was soon to be ready. The literary societies lost everything. I lost all books, or, those in my class room. The laboratories were almost a total loss. Fortunately, the library, records, and office furniture were all in the new Y.M.C.A. building. Before the fire had begun to die out, the Senior class called the student body together and they pledged themselves by classes in writing to stand by the Faculty and the College, and that no one would leave. The Faculty also met shortly after and unanimously decided to continue college work the next day as usual, meeting their classes in places designated. Probably not another institution in the State could have done this. But the old College building is gone forever!!!"Following the fire, the citizens of Sherman raised $50,000 to help the college rebuild.

It is indeed well known that nitrogen-containing surface groups confer to AC an increased ability to absorb acid gases [11, 12] and phenolic compounds [13].

Another method of getting nitrogen-enriched AC is the exposure of the preliminary AC to nitrogen compounds in elevated temperatures [15, 16].

Among {{unresolved}} enigmas {{of ancient}} terrestrial ecosystems functioning, the origin <b>of</b> social life, <b>wood</b> decomposition, provisioning <b>of</b> dinosaur dung and cleanness of Mesozoic ground belong to most important ones (Zherikhin 2002). Sample from dinosaur-aged (125 -million-year old) amber of Lebanon provided partial answer {{for all these}} questions (Vršanský et al. 2013). An immature individual of the cockroach family Blattulidae was preserved with coprolites partially extruded from the body and containing <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> indicating external pre-digestion. Based on distribution curves (obtained using ST) a hypothesised was advanced that source <b>of</b> the <b>wood</b> <b>particles</b> were dinosaur feces. Additionally, identical <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> were discovered in dung of Mesozoic dinosaurs and lystrosaurs (Fiorelli et al. 2013, unpublished), supporting the present claims in unrequiring chewing <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> by cockroaches. The presence <b>of</b> processed <b>wood</b> with smooth edges is important in providing evidence for the occurrence of lignolytic endosymbionts in ancient cockroaches, which are transferred only in multigenerational organisation of population structure (e. g. in termites). In contrast to intuition, masses of dinosaur dung did not decay automatically as they contain too much nitrogen (as in birds) and normally would be deposited analogically to guano (high proportion of phosphorus). Nevertheless, after the extraction of nitrogen, dung is further exploited by plants, microorganisms and animal decomposers. This is {{in sharp contrast to}} exploitation of mammal dung and its fixed rapid exploiters. Nevertheless, also mammal dung can prevent growth of plants including grasses (see example from present-day Australia, where introduction of dung beetles was necessary - Bornemissza 1960). Huge amounts of dinosaur dung would cover surface and prevent growth of the lowest levels of plants, which would allow the significant erosion. Thus, thanks to an amber cockroach we now know that Mesozoic forests were rather clean due to clean-up services provided by cockroaches (no other dung-provisioning insects are known {{from the beginning of the}} Mesozoic).

Nesse sentido, avaliou-se a resistência natural a fungos apodrecedores de painéis aglomerados confeccionados com partículas de madeira (Eucalyptus grandis) e/ou bambu (Bambusa vulgaris). Foram produzidas, em laboratório, chapas aglomeradas nas dimensões 50 x 50 x 0, 95 cm e massa específica pré-estabelecida em 0, 70 g cm- 3, nas proporções de 100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50, 25 : 75 e 0 : 100 de madeira e bambu, respectivamente. A massa de partículas representou 91 % da massa seca de cada painel, sendo, o restante, formado pelo adesivo ureia-formaldeído (8 %) e parafina (1 %). Para determinação da resistência natural ao ataque de fungos xilófagos, os painéis foram testados em laboratório e utilizados os fungos Gloeophyllum trabeum (podridão parda) e Trametes versicolor (podridão branca), de acordo com a ASTM D 2017 (2005). Quanto aos resultados, foi observado que os painéis confeccionados com mistura de partículas de madeira e bambu apresentaram menor resistência ao ataque dos fungos apodrecedores.

Three types of compositions (composites) with 10, 20 and 30 % <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> flour have been prepared for the tests. To evaluate the role of used filler conducted it’s quantitative analysis by linear method. Parameters like volume fraction of the filler, the number <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> flour per surface area and mean wood fiber diameter, were determinated. Findings: The results of microscopic observations of the etched sections and fractures obtained at room temperature and at liquid nitrogen temperature indicate good matching between the filler particles and the structure of basic polymer, due mainly to bonding of the individual lamellae in spherulites. The reinforced polymer reveals a cracking micromechanism which is called crazing. Research limitations/implications: The further research are required {{to solve the problem of}} the filler contrast.

This study was developed to compare the ability of sound absorption based on treated filler and <b>particle</b> size <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> dust. By choosing the size of 355 μm, three different percentage has been selected which is 10 %, 15 % and 20 % for both conditions. These samples has been tested by using Impedance Tube test according to ASTM E- 1050 for sound absorption coefficient, α measurement and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for determine the porosity for each samples. 10 % loaded of WDB as filler gives highest sound absorption coefficient of 0. 999 at 4015. 63 Hz. Meanwhile for 20 % loaded of WDA gives 0. 997 at 3228. 13 Hz. When comparing the sound absorption coefficient for both sounds absorbing materials, WDB-polymer foam composite RMD showed higher value of sound absorption coefficient, α at higher frequency as compared to WDA-polymer foam composite...|$|R
30|$|Different {{responses}} are observed when different <b>particle</b> sizes <b>of</b> biomass are used. Sun et al. determined the solubilities <b>of</b> different sized <b>wood</b> <b>particles</b> in [emim][CH 3 COO] and [emim][Cl] ILs [25]. The good dissolution efficiency of [emim][CH 3 COO] was preserved despite {{of the increase}} in the <b>particle</b> size <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> from smaller than 0.125  mm (99 % solubility) to 0.5 - 1  mm (93 % solubility). The different wood size solubilities were more pronounced for [emim][Cl]. At wood size smaller than 0.125  mm the dissolution reached 52.6 % and with <b>particles</b> size <b>of</b> 0.25 - 0.5  mm only 26.0 % of dissolution was achieved. This suggests that [emim][CH 3 COO] is more efficient and it would be much more economical to use since the energy needed to reduce the biomass particle size could be minimised [25]. Furthermore, Nguyen et al. investigated the influence <b>of</b> <b>particle</b> size using the same IL in the pre-treatment of rice straw [51]. The study was conducted with three size ranges, smaller than 2  mm, 2 – 5  mm and larger than 10  mm determining the cellulose recovery and glucose conversion yields after pre-treatment. The treatment with the finest particle size appears to have a considerable loss of cellulose content. Nevertheless, these samples showed the highest glucose conversion, but it was ineffective due to low cellulose content in the sample. The glucose conversion of the 2 – 5  mm particle-sized samples was significantly higher than that of[*]>[*] 10  mm particle-sized samples and similar to the value of lower than 2  mm particle-sized samples [51].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} synthesis <b>of</b> {{activated carbon}} <b>particles</b> by pyrolysis <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> fibers and their dispersion in urea formaldehyde with an aim to optimize a stable activated carbon particles/urea formaldehyde adhesives. All the adhesive hybrids were characterized with X-ray diffractometry (XRD) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), while the dispersion <b>of</b> activated carbon <b>particles</b> was studied with Field Emission {{scanning electron microscopy}} (FESEM). Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that activated carbon particles have little high effect in the thermal stability of the UF adhesive. It is observe in the TGA graph that the thermal stability of the UF based activated carbon particles is higher that UF only. The scanning micrograph provide confirmation of the smoother surfaces in the UF adhesive made with activated carbon particles...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{characteristic}} {{times of}} the main intra <b>particle</b> phenomena <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> pyrolysis are discussed {{to develop a new}} model of biomass pyrolysis. The model accounts for a simplified multi-step chemical decomposition with the formation of tars at liquid phase inside the particle. The tars at liquid phase are then competitively converted into a secondary char and gases and evaporated following a Clausius-Clapeyron law. To our knowledge, a tar evaporation law had so far never been coupled with cellulose pyrolysis kinetics. The convective mass transport of all the volatile species through the porous particle is modelled by a Darcy's law. This model offers a first approach to simulate the tar (at liquid phase) life time and its intra-particle conversion. The Clausius-Clapeyron evaporation parameters are reviewed and modified if levoglucosan or cellobiosan are supposed as the main tar compounds at liquid phase. The effects of these parameters on cellulose pyrolysis mass loss rate are modelled and discussed. Mass transfer limitations can lead to a high intra-particle over-pressure and can control the life time of tar at liquid phase and the subsequent "secondary" char formation from the liquid tar conversion...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistance}} of composites board on termite attack {{is one of}} the important parameters on its quality. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the resistance to the subterranean termite attack of composite board made from Indonesian community forest tree species which was combined with cement sack waste paper as face and back layers. The samples of composite board fabricated from shaving <b>particles</b> <b>of</b> gmelina <b>wood</b> (Gmelina arborea), candlenut wood (Aleurites mollucana), and sengon wood (Paraserianthes falcataria) bonded by melamine formaldehyde resin at 10 % based on oven dry weight <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> and face/back layers. The treatment of this study consists of three factors namely: wood species (3 levels), part of tree (2 levels: steam and branch), and layers (2 levels: no layers and using 4 layers each side). Each board type was tested in three replications, totally 36 boards were produced. The results obtained are as follows: 1) the higher of composite board subterranean termite resistant were composite board made of gmelina, sengon, and candlenut, respectively. 2) the {{resistance of}} composite board made of steam part were not significantly different with those of branch part, 3) composite board made <b>of</b> gmelina <b>wood</b> without face and back layers were more resistance compared to those with cement sack face/back layers. However, composite board made of candlenut and sengon wood with cement sack face/back layers were more resistance compared to those of without face/back layers...|$|R
