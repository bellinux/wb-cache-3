40|$|Analyses of the {{occurrence}} and lethality of disasters {{show that in}} large coalition systems, such as democracies, {{the occurrence}} of disasters has little effect on protest and leader sur-vival, but should large numbers of <b>people</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> these disasters more protests occur and leader survival diminishes. In contrast, in more autocratic small coalition systems, disasters jeop-ardize a leader’s tenure in office because they serve as coordination devices for disgruntled citizens. For small coalition leaders, the occurrence of disasters increase protest and reduce tenure but the level of fatalities has little effect. The anticipation of these potential political effects accounts for why many more <b>people</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> disasters in small coalition systems than large coalition systems. ...|$|R
