In a multi-user macrodiversity MIMO scenario, users may also be far apart. Therefore, every constituent link in the virtual MIMO link has distinct average link SNR.

The spacecraft's immediate task was to begin returning the 6.25 gigabytes of information collected. The free space <b>path</b> <b>loss</b> at its distance of 4.5 light-hours (3,017,768,400 km) is approximately 303 dB at 7 GHz. Using the high gain antenna and transmitting at full power, New Horizons' EIRP is +83 dBm, and at this distance the signal reaching Earth is −220 dBm. The received signal level (RSL) using one, un-arrayed Deep Space Network antenna with 72 dBi of forward gain equals −148 dBm. [...] Because of the extremely low RSL, it could only transmit data at 1 to 2 kb/s.|$|E

Our goal is to find trajectories that are safe with respect to grounding and collision, fuel efficient and satisfy criteria for communication such that the UAVs form a chain with a given radio communication capacity. A centralized MPC and a distributed MPC approach to solve the path planning problem are proposed. Both approaches explicitly incorporate constraints on radio communication <b>path</b> <b>losses,</b> computed by using SPLAT!. In order to enhance the MPC problem computation, the terrain below each UAV and the communication <b>path</b> <b>losses</b> are approximated with linear functions. The control performance and the computational efficiency of the distributed MPC and the centralized MPC approaches are compared based on a simulation case study with two UAVs...|$|R
