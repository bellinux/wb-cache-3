5|$|Typically {{operated}} {{from small}} aircraft carriers, large amphibious assault ships and simple forward operating bases, AV-8Bs {{have participated in}} numerous military and humanitarian operations, proving themselves versatile assets. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the Gulf War. The aircraft took part in combat during the Iraq War beginning in 2003. The Harrier II has served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan since 2001, and was used in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent in critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are {{to be replaced by}} the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II, with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.|$|E
5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (positive electrode). To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E

25|$|In essence, this {{technique}} is a statistical method of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if something unusual or abnormal is going on. Imagine {{if you were to}} observe the behavior of normal, paying customers at a brick-and-mortar department store. On average, they would spend in aggregate a known <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back on shelves, trying on clothes, filling a basket, waiting in line, paying for their purchases, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. For example, if a huge number of customers arrive and spend all their time picking up items and setting them down, but never making any purchases, this can be flagged as unusual behavior.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, a {{study by}} Lippa (1978) found {{evidence}} for {{the extent to which}} individuals present themselves in a different way. This is called expressive behaviour, and it is dependent upon the individuals' motivation and ability to control that behaviour. Lippa (1978) examined 68 students who were asked to role-play by pretending to teach a math class. The students' level of extraversion and introversion were rated based on their external/expressive behaviours such as stride length, graphic expansiveness, the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> they spent talking, the amount of time they spent making eye contact, and the total time of each teaching session. This study found that actual introverts were perceived and judged as having more extraverted-looking expressive behaviours because they were higher in terms of their self-monitoring. This means that the introverts consciously put more effort into presenting a more extraverted, and rather socially desirable, version of themselves. Thus, individuals are able to regulate and modify behaviour based on their environmental situations.|$|E
25|$|The {{ontogeny}} {{of sleep}} {{is the study}} of sleep across different age groups of a species, particularly during development and aging. Among mammals, infants sleep the longest. Human babies have 8 hours of REM sleep and 8 hours of NREM sleep on an average. The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on each mode of sleep varies greatly in the first few weeks of development and some studies have correlated this to the degree of precociality of the child. Within a few months of postnatal development, there is a marked reduction in percentage of hours spent in REM sleep. By the time the child becomes an adult, he spends about 6–7 hours in NREM sleep and only about an hour in REM sleep. This is true not only of humans, but of many animals dependent on their parents for food. The observation that the percentage of REM sleep is very high in the first stages of development has led to the hypothesis that REM sleep might facilitate early brain development. However, this theory has been contested by other studies.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 February 1967, Scorpion entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for needed {{refueling}} overhaul. However, {{instead of}} a much-needed complete overhaul, she received only emergency repairs to get quickly back on duty. The preferred SUBSAFE program required increased submarine overhaul times, from 9 months in length to 36 months. Intensive vetting of submarine component quality, SUBSAFE, was required, coupled with various improvements and intensified structural inspections– particularly, hull-welding inspections using ultrasonic testing– and reduced availability of critical parts like seawater piping. Cold War pressures prompted US Submarine Force Atlantic (SUBLANT) officers to seek ways to cut corners. The last overhaul cost one-seventh of those performed on other nuclear submarines at the same time.

30|$|Electromagnetic wave {{propagation}} research in frequency band 58 GHz was started at TESTCOM in Praha {{due to lack}} of experimentally obtained results needed for a realistic calculation of quality and availability of point-to-point fixed systems. Rain attenuation data obtained from a path at 58 GHz with V polarization located in Praha was processed over a 5 -year period. Rainfall intensities have been measured by means of a heated siphon rain gauge. In parallel, rainfall intensity data from rain gauge records was statistically processed over the same year periods as the rain attenuation data. Cumulative distributions of rainfall intensities obtained as well as cumulative distributions of rain attenuation obtained are compared with the calculated ones in accordance with relevant ITU-R recommendations. The results obtained can be used as the primary basis for the possible extension of the ITU-R recommendation for calculating rain attenuation distributions up to 60 GHz. The obtained dependence <b>of</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the average year on the <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the average worst month is also compared with the relevant ITU-R recommendation.
