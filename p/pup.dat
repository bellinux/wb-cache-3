500|$|Coyote <b>pups</b> {{are born}} in dens, hollow trees, or under ledges, and weigh [...] at birth. They are altricial, and are {{completely}} dependent on milk {{for their first}} 10 days. The incisors erupt at about 12 days, the canines at 16, and the second premolars at 21. Their eyes open after 10 days, by which point the <b>pups</b> become increasingly more mobile, walking by 20 days, and running {{at the age of}} six weeks. The parents begin supplementing the <b>pup's</b> diet with regurgitated solid food after 12–15 days. By the age of four to six weeks, when their milk teeth are fully functional, the <b>pups</b> are given small food items such as mice, rabbits, or pieces of ungulate carcasses, with lactation steadily decreasing after two months. Unlike wolf <b>pups,</b> coyote <b>pups</b> begin seriously fighting (as opposed to play fighting) prior to engaging in play behavior. A common play behavior includes the coyote [...] "hip-slam". By three weeks of age, coyote <b>pups</b> bite each other with less inhibition than wolf <b>pups.</b> By the age of four to five weeks, <b>pups</b> have established dominance hierarchies, and are by then more likely to play rather than fight. The male plays an active role in feeding, grooming, and guarding the <b>pups,</b> but abandons them if the female goes missing before the <b>pups</b> are completely weaned. The den is abandoned by June to July, and the <b>pups</b> follow their parents in patrolling their territory and hunting. <b>Pups</b> may leave their families in August, though can remain for much longer. The <b>pups</b> attain adult dimensions at eight months, and gain adult weight a month later.|$|R
5|$|Nursing lasts six {{to eight}} months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother {{beginning}} to offer bits of prey at one to two months.

40|$|AbstractPrenatal stress (PS) {{and early}} {{postnatal}} environment may alter maternal care. Infant rats learn {{to identify their}} mother through the association between maternal care and familiar odors. Female Wistar rats were exposed to restraint stress for 30 min, 4 sessions per day, in the last 7 days of pregnancy. At birth, <b>pups</b> were cross-fostered and assigned to the following groups: prenatal non-stressed mothers raising non-stressed <b>pups</b> (NS:NS), prenatal stressed mothers raising non-stressed <b>pups</b> (S:NS), prenatal non-stressed mothers raising stressed <b>pups</b> (NS:S), prenatal stressed mothers raising stressed <b>pups</b> (S:S). Maternal behaviors were assessed during 6 postpartum days. On postnatal day (PND) 7, the behavior {{of male and female}} <b>pups</b> was analyzed in the odor preference test; and noradrenaline (NA) activity in olfactory bulb (OB) was measured. The results showed that restraint stress increased plasma levels of corticosterone on gestational day 15. After parturition, PS reduced maternal care, decreasing licking the <b>pups</b> and increasing frequency outside the nest. Female <b>pups</b> from the NS:S, S:NS, S:S groups and male <b>pups</b> from the S:S group showed no nest odor preference. Thus, at day 7, female <b>pups</b> that were submitted to perinatal interventions showed more impairment in the nest odor preference test than male <b>pups.</b> No changes were detected in the NA activity in the OB. In conclusion, repeated restraint stress during the last week of gestation reduces maternal care and reduces preference for a familiar odor in rat <b>pups</b> in a sex-specific manner...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Our {{previous}} studies demonstrated that methamphetamine (MA) administered during gestation and lactation periods impairs maternal behavior {{as well as}} the postnatal development of rat <b>pups.</b> The present study tested the hypothesis that the cross-fostering influences the development of rat <b>pups.</b> Mothers were daily exposed to injection of MA (5 mg/kg) and saline for 9 weeks: three weeks prior to impregnation, throughout the entire gestation period and during lactation. As a control (C) females with no injections were used. On postnatal day (PD 1), <b>pups</b> were cross-fostered so that each mother received some of her own and some of the <b>pups</b> of mother with the other treatments. <b>Pup’s</b> development and sensorimotor coordination was examined between PD 1 and PD 23.

40|$|Serotonin:acetyl {{coenzyme}} A N-acetyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 1. 5) Activity in pineal gland was assayed in rats {{which were}} born and raised under diurnal lighting conditions, in continuous darkness, or in constant light. N-Acetyltransferase activity in the <b>pups</b> raised under diurnal lighting showed a rhythmic pattern, with high enzyme activity during dark period. The <b>pups</b> raised in continuous darkness also showed a rhythmic pattern, the phase of which was delayed by 8 hr in 7 -week-old pups; the rhythmic phase of N-acetyltransferase began in the evening in 12 -day-old <b>pups</b> and was regularly delayed by 1 hr every week. The <b>pups</b> raised in constant illumination also showed a rhythmic pattern; the rhythmic phase was delayed by 3 hr every week. When the mother rats were coupled in darkness and maintained in darkness during pregnancy and after the <b>pups</b> were born, their <b>pups</b> again showed a rhythmic pattern. These observations indicate that the biological clock for N-acetyltransferase is generated independently of environmental lighting. When mothers were coupled under reversed lighting conditions and transferred into darkness or light, the rhythmic pattern in their <b>pups</b> was inverted 180 degrees from that of <b>pups</b> born of diurnal mothers. When the <b>pups</b> were raised in darkness, the rhythmic phase of N-acetyltransferase in the <b>pups</b> {{was similar to that}} of their mothers.

500|$|Wolves bear {{relatively}} large <b>pups</b> in small litters {{compared to other}} canid species. The average litter consists of 5–6 <b>pups,</b> with litter sizes tending to increase in areas where prey is abundant, though exceptionally large litters of 14–17 <b>pups</b> occur only 1% of the time. <b>Pups</b> are usually born in spring, coinciding with a corresponding increase in prey populations. <b>Pups</b> are born blind and deaf, and are covered in short soft grayish-brown fur.

5|$|For {{temperate}} living bats, births typically {{take place}} in May or June in the northern hemisphere while births in the southern hemisphere occur in November and December. Tropical species give birth {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. In most bat species, female carry and give birth to one <b>pup</b> per litter. For bat embryos, apoptosis only affects the hindlimbs, while the forelimbs retain webbing between the digits which form into the wing membranes. At birth, a bat <b>pup</b> can be up to 40 percent of the mother's weight, and hence the pelvic girdle of the female expands during birth as the two halves are connected by a flexible ligament. Females typically give birth in a heads-up or horizontal position, using gravity to make birthing easier. The young emerges rear-first, possibly to prevent the wings from getting tangled, and the females cradles it in her wing and tail membranes. In many species, females give birth and raise their young in maternity colonies and individuals may assist others in their birthing process.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mongolian gerbils {{living with}} their natal {{families}} undergo delayed reproductive maturation while helping to rear their younger siblings, whereas those housed away from their natal families may mature earlier but often respond aggressively to unfamiliar <b>pups.</b> We tested whether cohabitation with <b>pups</b> contributes to reproductive suppression and inhibition of infanticidal behavior, using young males and females housed with (1) their parents and younger siblings (<b>pups),</b> (2) parents without <b>pups,</b> (3) mixed-sex littermate groups, or (4) mixed-sex groups of unrelated peers.
