Two MATLAB scripts, based on the same image treatment, were developed - one for small droplets present at the very beginning of condensation (program 1) and another for bigger droplets (program 2). At the beginning (program 1), detection errors were rare avoiding complex treatments necessary in program 2. The two programs pretreated images by applying the discrete Laplace operator to reduce contrasts inhomogeneity by accentuating dark/bright interfaces, thus giving <b>droplet</b> <b>profiles</b> [19] (see Fig.  3 c and d). The enhanced images were segmented to binary images using Otsu’s method - <b>droplet</b> <b>profiles</b> appeared in white on a black background [20]. In order to close <b>profiles</b> and obtain <b>droplets,</b> a close operator was used and the image edges were manually turned white, reducing the studied area but closing the partially-seen <b>droplet</b> <b>profiles.</b> Then, all black pixels not belonging to the background and circle by white pixels were turned in white to fill all <b>droplet</b> <b>profiles.</b> However, some <b>droplets</b> were connected in clusters and a watershed function was used to dissociate them.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} a catastrophic free nuclear reactor, the {{stability}} of the nuclear reactor must be guaranteed also in case of hypothetical accidents, that the consequences are limited to the power plant by self-acting mechanisms. In this paper, the inherent safety properties of the High-Temperature-Reactor (HTR) against water ingress accidents will be explained. The water ingress in the primary cycle of a HTR by a leakage of the steam generator is an accident, involving {{the stability of}} the reactor in two points. The additional moderation of neutrons by water molecules leads to reactivity effects. Further the fuel elements may be corroded leading to a formation of water gas. In case of a small leakage in the steam generator liquid water is injected in the primary circuit in form of small droplets, which can be transported by the gas flow into the core. The amount of water within the core is mainly dependant on the reactor protection system, the flow conditions in the primary circuit and the droplet size. Hypothetical accident scenarios will be defined in a first step considering the behaviour of the reactor protection system. In the second step, calculations to the formation of drops and the behaviour of the blower-unit under accident condition are done. Thereafter analytical and numerical calculation models for the transport and the separation of droplets will be developed. The calculation results will be validated with measurement results for the inertial separation of water droplets from an air flow. Furthermore analytical models to transfer the result to several conditions during the accident are described. Based on the transfer models the efficiency of the droplet separation in the primary circuit of a HTR is estimated in the experimental facility SEAT. The SEAT facility consists of a flow channel with integrated measurement for determining droplet sizes. It will be shown, that the installation of additional <b>droplet</b> <b>separators</b> in the primary circuit is useful with respect to the duration of the accident and drying the primary circuit alter the accident. In this context the separation efficiency is tested with différent types of separators in single or series arrangements. Finally a self-acting safety element is suggested, which consists of a <b>droplet</b> <b>separator</b> and a float arrangement for strongly reducing the duration ofthe accident...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Steam {{generator}} tube ruptures (SGTR) with a concurrent stuck open {{safety relief}} valve are counted among the risk dominant accident sequences {{because of the potential}} for radioactive products to bypass the containment. Owing to the absence of relevant empirical data and the complexity of the geometry and controlling processes, the aerosol removal in the steam generator (SG) tubes and in the secondary side is not well understood. Therefore, little or no credit is usually taken for aerosol retention due to natural processes in the various components of a SG. To help reduce the uncertainties associated with fission product release following an SGTR sequence, the Paul Scherrer Institut has initiated an international experimental project to be performed in the ARTIST (AeRosol Trapping In a Steam generaTor) facility in the time period from 2002 to 2007. The ARTIST test section is a scaled model of a real SG, and is comprised of a 264 -tube bundle with a maximum height of 3. 8 m, as well as one full-size <b>droplet</b> <b>separator</b> and one full-size steam dryer. The ARTIST facility is capable of producing soluble and insoluble aerosols and entrain them at sonic gas flow rates (up to 0. 25 kg/s, thus matching comparable values predicted by the codes. In addition, aerosols can be generated at prototypical concentrations (up to 5 g/m 3) an...|$|R
40|$|Various {{substances}} in {{the liquid state}} tend to form droplets. In this paper the shape of such droplets is investigated within the spherical model of a lattice gas. We show {{that in this case}} the droplet boundary is always diffusive, as opposed to sharp, and find the corresponding density <b>profiles</b> (<b>droplet</b> shapes). Translation-invariant versions of the spherical model do not fix the spatial location of the droplet, hence lead to mixed phases. To obtain pure macroscopic states (which describe localized droplets) we use generalized quasi-averaging. Conventional quasi-averaging deforms droplets and, hence, can not be used for this purpose. On the contrary, application of the generalized method of quasi-averages yields droplet shapes which do not depend on the magnitude of the applied external field. Comment: 22 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

To conduct this research, a food microstructure approach was utilised developing emulsion structures’ using either a batch or continuous process and monitoring the affect these structures had on physical and material properties. The lubricating properties of emulsions structures were then compared to a trained sensory panel. Finally the release behaviour of a moisturising agent was investigated. It was shown that the ingredients used to produce the microstructure are pivotal in indicating the melting <b>profile,</b> <b>droplet</b> size and material properties of the final structure. Specifically, when an aqueous phase is incorporated within a hard shell the elastic modulus increases as the aqueous phase become part of the wax network. The effect of lubrication showed that friction coefficient of a solid emulsion could be related to how smooth a lipstick would be perceived based on the Kokani Model. Finally, it was shown that the release of a moisturising agent is governed by the droplet size and the amount of destruction caused to the wax network...|$|R
40|$|Mist eliminators (also called <b>droplet</b> eliminators, <b>droplet</b> <b>separators</b> or demisters) are {{devices that}} can remove liquid {{droplets}} from a gas flow. The gas flow laden with droplets {{is forced to}} pass through different channels, changing direction in a repetitive manner. Wave-plate (or vane type) eliminator are widely employed in chemical and industrial processes involving gas and vapour flows where mist removal is necessary for several reasons. For instance, {{one of the most}} important objectives is to restrict pollutant emission into the environment, as in cooling towers applications. Wave-plate mist eliminators can operate in vertical and horizontal situations, but in both cases, the removal of liquid droplets occurs mainly by inertial impaction. In cooling towers, spraying water is distributed over a heat transfer surface across or through which a stream of air is passing. Thus, water droplets can be captured by the stream of air and they will be carried out of the system. This phenomenon is known as drift. In countries with warm climate, inside the cooling towers the conditions of high temperature and humidity can strongly induce the spreading of pathogens agents, especially the Legionella pneumophila. The main disadvantage of installing mist (i. e., drift) eliminators is an increased pressure loss of the airflow. High-pressure loss contributes to lower flow rate of air or higher engine power of the ventilators. This fact leads to obtain lower overall efficiency values for the air-conditioning systems. Since a lack of systematic studies on comparative evaluation of morphologically similar separators has been detected, the behaviour of four wave-type eliminators having a similar geometry is studied. Both droplet collection efficiency and the pressure drop coefficient are calculated. Special emphasis is made on the validation of the numerical model with results taken from the literature, the study of the effects of relevant parameters, and the achievement of a procedure to evaluate the overall efficiency of each regarded type of eliminator. The obtained results may contribute to improve the passive droplets restraint systems in mechanical cooling towers, increasing the overall operation of the cooling tower on one side, and lowering their environmental impact on the other...|$|R

With pendant drops of hexadecane, application of the electric field caused a reduction in the apparent surface tension, 7 app. In surrounding gases such as N 2, CO 2, and Ar, <b>droplet</b> <b>profiles</b> similar to those in air were obselved. While gases such as He and Ne have low breakdown potentials, no change in <b>droplet</b> <b>profile</b> upon application of an electric field was detectable. The glow discharge in He was investigated for oil (insulator), water, glycerol, and a brass tip, for both positive and negative potentials. Conducting liquids such as water and glycerol permitted discharge to take place {{from the surface of the}} droplet, whereas insulating oils forced the discharge to occur at the metal tip, where the drop is attached. With flowing drops, the liquid conductivity was a major factor in the electrostatic disruption of the liquid surface. With insulating liquids such as paraffinic oil, no disruption occurred due to the lack of sufficient free ions in the bulk liquid. With conducting liquids such as water, very unstable streams were produced. Stable jets having a conical base were only produced with semiconducting liquids (nonpolar liquids with dissolved ionic materials).

Desired characteristics of atomized fluid radically depend on the application of the spraying process which could be achieved by the appropriate selection of the nozzle, as well as changing the operating conditions. The objective of this study is experimental investigation of the atomization process by an effervescent nozzle for a variety of fluids where {{there is a lack of}} experimental knowledge. Four different liquids were taken: distilled water, pure glycerol, water-glycerol aqueous solution and suspensions. The suspension is prepared by an optimized proportion for each case in order to mitigate the sedimentation and clogging of suspended beads. We determined the properties of the atomized fluids in accordance to the commonly used quantities in practical applications. Beside the rheology analyses of the fluids, three types of characterization experiments such as shadowgraphs, PIV and PDPA were conducted. Firstly, shadowgraphs were captured and the overall structures of spraying regions were observed. Accordingly, PIV and PDPA data were provided, consisting of a velocity profile in different operating conditions as well as distributions of a droplets’ diameter. The main characteristics of atomized fluids are velocity <b>profiles,</b> <b>droplet</b> size distributions, spray cone angle, and breakup lengths. These characteristics with dimensionless variables, namely Gas to Liquid Ratios (GLRs), are calculated and compared.

Nine Streptococcus mitis strains, {{two of which are}} known to produce biosurfactants, and two S. salivarius strains, which do not produce biosurfactants, were suspended at two concentrations in a 10 -mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. 0. Subsequently, a 100 -mu-l droplet of each suspension was put on a fluoroethylenepropylene surface and the <b>profile</b> of the <b>droplet</b> determined with a contour monitor as a function of time up to 2 h. The surface tension of these suspensions was then calculated from the <b>droplet</b> <b>profiles</b> with ADSA-P. The surface tension of suspensions of the two non-producing strains remained stable within 4 mJ. m- 2, whereas the surface tension of suspensions of five out of the nine S. mitis strains employed, including those of the known producer strains, decreased significantly (up to 26 mJ. m- 2). This decrease was, in addition, concentration dependent. From these observations, we decided that all strains for which these concentration-dependent decreases were observed, could be regarded as biosurfactant producers. In order to {{rule out the possibility that}} the surface tension decreases observed were due to the collection of cells at the suspension-air interface, we investigated whether there was a relationship between surface tension decrease and hydrophobicity of the cells, as assessed by contact angle measurements and bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons.

A lot of scholars and experts aim to investigate the effects of droplets on the climate and make precise forecast for hurricane conditions. So the <b>profiles</b> of <b>droplets</b> concentration at different heights above the sea surface are important. For a better study of the momentum and energy transport among the boundary layer, we also need to know the distribution of droplets with different radii.

The advantage of SAS process is that thermal degradation does not occur in the pharmaceutical compounds as the operating temperature is near to room temperature. This process starts with the atomization of a solution, a mixture of pharmaceutical compound and solvent, in the supercritical carbon dioxide environment. The transfer of carbon dioxide (antisolvent) to the droplet decreases the solubility of solute in the solution causing precipitation of solute in micro to nano-particle size range. In this work, four solvents: dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, acetone and dichloromethane have been considered to study the effect of solvent on droplet diameter, solvent mass transfer rate into supercritical carbon dioxide environment and velocity <b>profile.</b> The atomized <b>droplet</b> moves downward and mass transfer takes place.

At ϕ_ov = 0. 62, the flame takes a cylindrical shape, and changes to a cone shape with increasing fuel loading to obtain higher ϕ_ov. Larger droplets are generally observed to have lower average and RMS axial velocities than smaller <b>droplets.</b> <b>Profiles</b> of <b>droplet</b> size distributions indicate a decreasing droplet number density downstream together with a shift to larger droplet diameters. The flame structure is observed to be relatively smooth at locations near the burner exit, and becomes more contorted with distance downstream. In general, droplets are observed to coincide with low-to-intermediate regions of OH. Occasionally, droplets appear to penetrate the flame front, and are detected in regions of intermediate-to-high OH. This occurs particularly at the downstream locations where the flame closes across the jet, with no significant averaged droplet penetration observed past 2 mm in the direction normal to the flame front. Measurements show a gradual reduction in flame surface density and higher flame front curvature with both distance downstream and increasing fuel loading. Estimates of the average droplet evaporation rate increase with both distance downstream and ϕ_ov, as droplets appear in higher mean progress variable regions.

40|$|Cloud development, {{the onset}} of {{precipitation}} {{and the effect of}} aerosol on clouds depend on the structure of the cloud <b>profiles</b> of <b>droplet</b> size and phase. Aircraft measurements of cloud profiles are limited in their temporal and spatial extent. Satellites were used to observe cloud tops not cloud profiles with vertical <b>profiles</b> of precipitation-sized <b>droplets</b> anticipated from CloudSat.   The recently proposed CLAIM- 3 D satellite mission (cloud aerosol interaction mission in 3 -D) suggests to measure profiles of cloud microphysical properties by retrieving them from the solar and infrared radiation reflected or emitted from cloud sides. Inversion of measurements from the cloud sides requires rigorous understanding of the 3 -dimentional (3 -D) properties of clouds. Here we discuss the reflected sunlight from the cloud sides and top at two wavelengths: one nonabsorbing to solar radiation (0. 67 μm) and one with liquid water efficient absorption of solar radiation (2. 1 μm). In contrast to the plane-parallel approximation, a conventional approach to all current operational retrievals, 3 -D radiative transfer is used for interpreting the observed reflectances. General properties of the radiation reflected from the sides of an isolated cloud are discussed. As a proof of concept, the paper shows a few examples of radiation reflected from cloud fields generated by a simple stochastic cloud model with the prescribed vertically resolved microphysics. To retrieve the information about droplet sizes, we propose to use the probability density function of the droplet size distribution and its first two moments instead of the assumption about fixed values of the droplet effective radius. The retrieval algorithm is based on the Bayesian theorem that combines prior information about cloud structure and microphysics with radiative transfer calculations...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} mass transfer inside a spherical droplet {{in the flow}} field of the another liquid has been made. The numerical computation was carried out based on finite volume method. The present work is concenrated at Peclet number in the range 0 ???Pe??? 10 +E 4 and Reynolds number in the range 0. 1 ??? Re ??? 10 +E 2. The investigation show that the influence of Peclet number to the mass transfer is very strong but that of Reynolds number is rather weak. Furthermore, {{it has been shown}} that the internal circulation influence the concentration <b>profile</b> inside the <b>droplet...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} diVusion and submonolayer {{spreading}} of rigid rodlike molecules on smooth surfaces. The molecules interact through a short-range repulsive potential and their motion is described through molecular dynamics simulations. We {{concentrate on the}} behavior of the collective diVusion coeYcient DC(h) {{as a function of the}} surface coverage h. Through analysis of spreading <b>profiles</b> of circular <b>droplets,</b> and rectangular density profiles we determine DC(h) for rods of varying lengths. We demonstrate that in analogy to experiments and simulations on chainlike flexible molecules, DC(h) initially increases with h due to entropic repulsion and displays a peak at intermediat...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} integral {{cross sections}} of large superfluid 4 HeN droplets {{and the number}} of atoms in the droplets (N = 103 − 104) have been measured in molecular beam scattering experiments. These measurements are found to be in good agreement with the cross sections predicted from density functional calculations of the radial density distributions with a 10 – 90 % surface thickness of 5. 7 ˚A. By using a simple model for the density <b>profile</b> of the <b>droplets</b> a thickness of about 6 – 8 ˚A is extracted directly from the data. Typeset using REVTEX 1 I...|$|R
