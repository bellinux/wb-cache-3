40|$|Demonstration that {{luminescence}} in irradiated silicon {{consists of}} a spectral group between 0. 80 and 1. 0 eV {{which seems to be}} independent of impurities, while a lower energy group between 0. 60 and 0. 80 eV is seen only in <b>pulled</b> <b>crystals.</b> The small halfwidth and temperature dependence of the sharp zero-phonon lines observed in these spectra indicate that the luminescence arises from a bound-to-bound transition. A model is proposed for the transition mechanism. Stress data taken on the 0. 79 -eV zero-phonon line in <b>pulled</b> <b>crystals</b> can be fit by either a tetragonal 100 (in brackets) defect symmetry or by conduction-band splitting effects. It is suggested that the 0. 79 -eV zero-phonon line and the 0. 60 - to 0. 80 -eV spectral group arise from the EPR G- 15 center. Stress data on a zero-phonon line at 0. 97 eV associated with the 0. 80 - to 1. 0 -eV spectral group can be explained by a trigonal 111 (in brackets) defect.

The parameters of the model can be evaluated by matching the results obtained from a detailed mathematical model of the CZ process or from extensive experimental data.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of crystal growth from the melt by a Czochralski-type technique under rotation were investigated with experimental rrangements {{in which the}} thermal and rotational axes did not coincide. A pronounced type of impurity heterogeneity was studied in particular.

Ac-cording to this analysis the microscopic growth rate of the "core " region in <b>crystals</b> <b>pulled</b> in the ~ 111 ~ direction is constant, whereas the microscopic growth rate of the "off core " region undergoes pronounced periodic fluctua-tions {{as a result of the}} thermal asymmetry of the experimental rrangement.

40|$|The axial {{resistivity}} {{profiles of}} the silicon crystals were quite level. It appears then that he evapora-tion of arsenic atoms from the liquid is nearly in equilibrium {{with the number of}} atoms rejected by the freezing solid. Figure 4 shows some typical plots of resistivity vs. the percentage <b>crystal</b> <b>pulled</b> for <b>crystals</b> grown by the vapor-phase technique and doped with arsenic trichloride. A few experiments using higher arsenic tri-chloride-supply rates and longer buildup periods of arsenic in the melt, produced crystals with re-sistivities not lower than 0. 0009 ohm-cm. It appears that saturation of arsenic in the melt occurs after 45 - 60 min, limiting the carrier concentration of arsenic in the crystal to a maximum value of 3 x 101 ~ atoms/cm'. Summary Arsenic-doped, melt-grown silicon crystals with level resistivity profiles, ranging from 1 x 104 to 5 x 10 - ~ ohm-cm, were obtained by passing an arsenic trichloride-helium ixture into a silicon crystal grower. The desired resistivity could be obtained by varying the arsenic trichloride supply rate and/or by varying the arsenic buildup period in the melt. Acknowledgments The authors wish to thank J. M.

It {{has a high}} Verdet constant and is a promising substrate crystal for the epitaxy of quantum materials with the pyrochlore structure. Large single crystals with adequate quality of Tb_ 2 Ti_ 2 O_ 7 or any pyrochlore are not available so far. Here we report the growth of high-quality bulk crystals using the Czochralski method to <b>pull</b> <b>crystals</b> from the melt. Prior work using the automated Czochralski method has suffered from growth instabilities like diameter fluctuation, foot formation and subsequent spiraling shortly after the seeding stage. In this study, the volumes of the crystals were strongly increased to several cubic centimeters by means of manual growth control, leading to crystal diameters up to 40 mm and crystal lengths up to 10 mm. Rocking curve measurements revealed full width at half maximum values between 28 and 40 " for 222 reflections. The specific heat capacity c_p was measured between room temperature and 1573 K by dynamic differential scanning calorimetry and shows the typical slow parabolic rise. In contrast, the thermal conductivity κ(T) shows a minimum near 700 K and increases at higher temperature T.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we will review {{techniques}} {{for the growth}} of single crystal mostly of insulating material which are shaped in the growth process. In particular, we will focus on the growth of single crystal fibers of optically activated materials; the emphasis will be placed on the so-called Laser Heated Pedestal Growth (LHPG) method of pulling crystalline fibers.
