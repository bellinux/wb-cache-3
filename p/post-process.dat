500|$|Because {{the output}} of {{forecast}} models based on atmospheric dynamics requires corrections near ground level, model output statistics (MOS) were developed in the 1970s and 1980s for individual forecast points (locations). The MOS apply statistical techniques to <b>post-process</b> {{the output of}} dynamical models with the most recent surface observations and the forecast point's climatology. [...] This technique can correct for model resolution as well as model biases. [...] Even with the increasing power of supercomputers, the forecast skill of numerical weather models only extends to about two weeks into the future, since the density and quality of observationstogether with the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations {{used to calculate the}} forecastintroduce errors which double every five days. The use of model ensemble forecasts since the 1990s helps to define the forecast uncertainty and extend weather forecasting farther into the future than otherwise possible.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to develop some {{computational}} experience and test the practical relevance of the theory of condition numbers C(d) for linear optimization, as applied to problem instances that one might encounter in practice. We used the NETLIB suite of linear optimization problems as a test bed for condition number computation and analysis. Our computational results indicate that 72 % of the NETLIB suite problem instances are ill-conditioned. However, after pre-processing heuristics are applied, only 19 % of the <b>post-processed</b> problem instances are ill-conditioned, and log C(d) of the finitely-conditioned <b>post-processed</b> problems is fairly nicely distributed. We also show that the number of IPM iterations needed to solve the problems in the NETLIB suite varies roughly linearly (and monotonically) with log C(d) of the <b>post-processed</b> problem instances. Empirical evidence yields a positive linear relationship between IPM iterations and log C(d) for the <b>post-processed</b> problem instances, significant at the 95 % confidence level. Furthermore, 42 % of the variation in IPM iterations among the NETLIB suite problem instances is accounted for by log C(d) of the problem instances after pre-processi...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} into accuracy enhancement for the derivatives of a discontinuous Galerkin solution demonstrated {{that there are}} many ways to approach obtaining higher order accuracy in the derivatives, each with different advantageous properties [J. K. Ryan and B. Cockburn (2009), “Local Derivative Post-Processing for the Discontinuous Galerkin Methods. ” Journal of Computational Physics, 228 : 8642 - 8664. ]. For the discontinuous Galerkin method, the order of accuracy without post-processing for the dth?derivative is k+ 1 -d. For the derivative of the <b>post-processed</b> solution it is 2 k+ 1 -d. Additionally, it was demonstrated that not only is calculating the derivative of the <b>post-processed</b> solution itself unnecessary, but also that O(h 2 k+ 1) can be obtained for the derivative solution for any order derivative, provided the solution is C 2 k+ 1. This is done using higher-order B-splines than used for the <b>post-processed</b> solution itself convolved against a finite difference derivative. This introduces higher levels of smoothness into the derivative <b>post-processed</b> approximation. However, this investigation was limited to a uniform mesh consideration, which is highly restrictive for practical applications. In this report, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of extending accuracy enhancement of derivatives to non-uniform meshes in one-dimension using the ideas of local L 2 -projection, characteristic length as well as direct implementation as done for the <b>post-processed</b> solution itself in [S.
