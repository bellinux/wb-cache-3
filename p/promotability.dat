40|$|Guided by the Career Construction Theory (Savickas, 2013), our {{research}} model posits that individuals {{rely on their}} adaptability resources and implement adapting responses, {{in the form of}} ingratiation, to increase their <b>promotability</b> at work.

40|$|Proefskrif (DEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1983 All evaluative {{actions in}} {{teaching}} {{are based on}} the expression of value judgments about the actions of individuals. Learning results, the pupils, the teachers, the curriculum, the school, the school system, the examination as well as the teacher whose <b>promotability</b> has to be evaluated are all subjected to norms of effectivity, success, achievement, acceptibility and admissibility. Furthermore, it is important that evaluation, for the sake of purposefulness, should have curricular matrix. The primary basis of this matrix is its aims. No objective evaluation is possible without these aims being definitely outlined. The ultimate objective of all evaluation is and should be to determine to what extent the predetermined aims and objectives have been accomplished. Evaluation as a curricular component has been refined through research and it can therefore, at present, progress very successfully and optimally by means of determined criteria. In formal education, and more specifically at secondary school level, enormous stress has been placed on examination results in Standard 10 in the past. A potential headmaster's <b>promotability</b> was closely associated with his ability to obtain excellent academic results with his candidates. Good examination results are of course of cardinal importance in teaching, but should not be the only criteria for the <b>promotability</b> of a teacher. The headmaster should, for these reasons, not only be strongly academically orientated, but should also be strongly orientated as regards educational and professional issues. The rapid progress in management training, backed by research, does not leave teaching and its managers untouched. For effective task accomplishment and efficient managerial actions every headmaster and potential headmaster should be well versed in school management. That also has the implication that the potential headmaster with promotion in mind will be evaluated according to objective criteria. The selection of teaching staff for promotion posts must be dealt with by responsible people in a most sensitive manner. School and class management have, in the past decade, developed into an independent field of study and research within the wider field of Teaching Management. For this reason the headmaster, as an effective manager, will, according to the most modern management theories and management principles, have to function in numerous management areas. In determining his promotion close attention will be paid to both his management abilities and his competence. An extensive literary study indicates that the promotion determinants in teaching do not throughout comply with all the principles of evaluation. In overseas countries, as well as in South Africa, the selection of teachers for promotion posts is at present being done by means of professional consideration and judgment. A uniform method for the determination of the <b>promotability</b> of teachers is therefore a prerequisite for doing justice to the selection and choice of teachers in management posts. At present there is a need in the teaching profession for a system of objective criteria in determining the <b>promotability</b> of teachers. That will ensure that the most competent individuals are appointed in these important management posts. It is also essential that the objective criteria should be aimed at the requirements linked to each specific management post. This would serve to ensure that the pre-determined aims be realised. By means of literature study definite managerial competencies for headmastership were identified. For each of these managerial competency categories five criteria for <b>promotability</b> were designed which were to be arranged in hierarchical order by the total corps of inspectors of education in the Transvaal. After 80, 2 % of the questionnaires had been received, the collected data were subjected to an empirical investigation and the precise order of precedence of each criterion could be determined as it ought to be. The respondents were also requested to arrange the competency categories hierarchically. In this way one had to determine how the inspectors of education would arrange these competency categories in a scale indicating preference. From these data a means of measurement for <b>promotability</b> was compiled by means of which the evaluator, in an objective way, could gather relevant information which could lead to the efficient evaluation and <b>promotability</b> determination of the teacher in question. The fact that differences of opinion occurred among respondents with regard to the hierarchical arrangement of definite criteria can be ascribed {{to the fact that the}} criteria contained elements which might overlap. Criteria in these cases could not be seen to have been mutually exclusive. A clear synthesis could be obtained throughout that could be regarded as an acceptable hierarchical arrangement. There were no significant differences in the hierarchical classification of academic, non-academic and those of all inspectors of education collectively. It did emerge clearly that female respondents could not always distinguish clearly between the importance of the different criteria. From the research it is obvious that there is a need for criteria for the determination of the <b>promotability</b> of teachers. In overseas countries this very important function is fulfilled in a very haphazard fashion. In the RSA there are, in all the provincial education departments, selection boards or selection committees which deal with the selection for promotion posts in that they compile selection lists for governing bodies of schools. The grading and evaluation of <b>promotability</b> are dealt with by inspectors of education who make selections on the basis of the applicant's professional work, and who conduct an interview with the applicant, and then, in consultation with the headmaster, decide on the degree of <b>promotability</b> of the teacher in question. The requirement set in this regard is to gather information, to plan the interview well, and then determine as objectively as possible what the degree of <b>promotability</b> of the teacher in question is. Seeing that even in the planning of the interview there are no written, uniform and target-directed criteria, it is suggested that the designated means of measurement for the <b>promotability</b> of a candidate can be applied for this purpose. The means of measurement for the determining of a teacher's <b>promotability</b> must be applied by all evaluators. This system of action should make a positive contribution to the professional handling of the determination of the <b>promotability</b> of a teacher. The author at this stage does not make any claims as to the validity or reliability of the means of measurement of <b>promotability.</b> The validity and reliability thereof can only be determined after repeated application of these by evaluators after which the <b>promotability</b> of the teacher in educational practice must be determined.

40|$|Sensitivity to {{promotion}} of transformation by tumor promoters in mouse epidermal JB 6 cells {{appears to have}} a genetic basis since the phenotypes of both promotable and nonpromotable JB 6 cells derived from a common parent line are stable.

Cellular DNA isolated from one of two P+ lines, JB 6 Cl 41 or JB 6 Cl 22, was CaPO 4 precipitated and used to transfect the P− cell line JB 6 Cl 30. At 7 days posttransfection, the cells were suspended in agar with or without TPA at 1. 6 × 10 − 8 M and assayed 10 days later for TPA-dependent colony formation. Untreated or Cl 30 DNA-treated P− JB 6 Cl 30 cells yielded 40 to 50 colonies per 105 cells. In contrast, transfection of Cl 30 cells with “P+ DNA” derived from either Cl 41 or Cl 22 yielded 200 to 500 TPA-induced colonies per 105 cells, or a five- to eightfold enhancement of <b>promotability.</b> The enhanced <b>promotability</b> obtained after transfection with P+ DNA was stable, as judged by the retention of <b>promotability</b> for at least eight passages in cell lines derived from TPA-induced agar colonies. Other transfectants showed irreversible transformation by TPA, as observed in the parental P+ lines. When NIH 3 T 3 cells instead of the putative preneoplastic JB 6 Cl 30 cells were used as recipients for transfection of P+ DNA, no evidence for acquisition of <b>promotability</b> was obtained. P− JB 6 Cl 25, like Cl 30, also permitted expression of transfected P+ DNA.

Overall transformational leadership resulted in higher evaluations of <b>promotability</b> due to higher perceptions of leaders’ communality and leadership effectiveness.

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{developed}} {{on the basis}} of need paradigm and psychological contract to explain why employees identify with their work organization.

Contrary to the traditional view that organizational identification is solely varied with social factors, the survey data from a Chinese factory demonstrated that organizational identification was negatively related to compensation loss and <b>promotability</b> drop. A three-way interaction was also found significant gender difference in response to procedural justice under motives unfulfillment. Unlike Chinese men, Chinese women would retain their organizational identification under compensation loss as long as they perceived procedural justice.

The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine whether a significant relationship existed between participation in a mentoring program and three measures of job success when analyzed by selected behavioral style variables. The study was an ex post factor field study which utilized 40 pairs of protected class lower-level managers. The two independent variables were mentoring and behavioral style. The three dependent variables were: percent of salary change, number of job rotations, and changes in <b>promotability</b> ratings [...] all measured over a one-year period. All subjects were employees of a large midwestern public utility. This company was selected because it had in operation a formal mentoring program for protected class managers. The experimental group consisted of the 40 mentees who had been in this company's formal mentoring program for approximately one year. The control group was matched subject-by-subject on seven demographic variables. The Level I: Life Styles Inventory was used to measure the participants' behavioral styles. These 12 LSI styles were then analyzed according to their four major quadrants: concern for task and satisfaction, concern for people and satisfaction, concern for people and security, and concern for task and security. The data were also analyzed according to task versus people and satisfaction versus security behavioral style orientation. All analyses were done by computer utilizing factorial analysis of variance. A significant interaction was found between group and style for the dependent variable of salary change. The task/satisfaction oriented mentored managers had a larger percent salary increase than the controls while the nonmentored managers with a people/security orientation had higher increases than the mentored. No significant main effects were found for salary change. For the second dependent variable, number of job rotations, no significant main effects nor significant interactions were found. A significant difference was found between the mentored and nonmentored groups on the <b>promotability</b> rating change index.

40|$|Exploring {{the role}} of both the {{employee}} and supervisor, we tested a model of how cognition-based work-to-family conflict manifests itself in the workplace, impacting employee job success. Based on conservation of resources theory {{and the concept of}} loss spirals, we hypothesized that when an employee's work interferes with family demands, the resulting work-to-family conflict spills over to the work domain via employee emotional exhaustion. We further argued that the behavioral manifestation of employee emotional exhaustion in the workplace is low employee engagement, as assessed by the supervisor. Drawing on signaling theory, we proposed that supervisor assessments of employee engagement are related to <b>promotability,</b> performance ratings, and salary.

Filipino university students (N = 289) and working adults (N = 495) participated in the study. Internal consistency estimates for the full scale and subscales ranged from. 87 to. 97. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the multidimensional and hierarchical model of career adaptability. The factor structure {{was similar to that}} obtained from the CAAS international validation from 18 countries. Results also suggested that career adaptability was positively associated with adaptivity in the form of tenacious goal pursuit and flexible goal adjustment as well as with adaptation outcomes of career satisfaction and <b>promotability.</b> Overall, the findings confirm the utility of CAAS in the Philippine context and support the model that states higher levels of personal adaptivity (willingness) and career adaptability (competence) relate to better adaptation outcomes in terms of career success...|$|E
40|$|Career adaptability, a psychosocial {{resource}} for managing career-related tasks, transitions, and traumas, {{is a central}} construct in career construction theory and the field of vocational psychology. Based on the career construction model of adaptation, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine relationships of career adaptability with measures of adaptivity, adapting responses, adaptation results, and demographic covariates. Results based on a total of 90 studies show that career adaptability is significantly associated with measures of adaptivity (i. e., cognitive ability, big five traits, self-esteem, core self-evaluations, proactive personality, future orientation, hope, and optimism), adapting responses (i. e., career planning, career exploration, occupational self-efficacy, and career decision-making self-efficacy), adaptation results (i. e., career identity, calling, career/job/school satisfaction, affective organizational commitment, job stress, employability, <b>promotability,</b> turnover intentions, income, engagement, self-reported work performance, entrepreneurial outcomes, life satisfaction, and positive and negative affect), as well as certain demographic characteristics (i. e., age, education). Multiple regression analyses based on meta-analytic correlations demonstrated the incremental predictive validity of career adaptability, above and beyond other individual difference characteristics, {{for a variety of}} career, work, and subjective well-being outcomes. Overall, the findings from this meta-analysis support the career construction model of adaptation...|$|E
40|$|A {{conceptual}} model of individual assessment {{through the use}} of biodata responses with minimal input information is outlined. The process is considered especially applicable to industrial psychology. A scored autobiographical data form, which measures the individual's past behavior and experiences, provides for assignmeat to a specific subgroup characterized by a cluster of distinctive behavioral actions as determined by marker variables. It is expected that the use of such subgroups for additional experiments and field studies in psychological and behavioral science research dill in turn provide more feedback definition of tne subgroups. Th. factoral dimensions of the subgroup profiles include: academic achievement, taugh-mindedness, goals, authoritarianism, and maladjustment. Assumptions emerging from the study are that past behavior is a good predictor of concurrent and future behavior, and confidence in post hoc validity of biodata-based subgroupine appears justified. The model's thesis is that distinctive, differental behavior can be associated with subgroup membership and by matching an individual's biodata profile with then subgroup profil, 4 modal behavior for the individual can be predicted. Present performance, <b>promotability,</b> sociability, motivation, managerial style, individual responsibility, innevativeness are seen as predictor variables in employee behavior through implementation of the model. Advantages and disadvantages of the model are also included. Statistical data on subgroup validity is presented. (AE) 'IO re...|$|E
40|$|There are {{multiple}} views in {{human resource management}} and organizational behavior concern-ing gender differences in measures of job performance. Some researchers suggest that males generally are evaluated higher than females {{across a variety of}} situations that include job per-formance measurement. At the same time, the presence of specific status cues in expectation states theory (EST; similar to the concept of individuating information) suggests that measures of job performance will be more similar than different for males and females. Previous analyses are unclear in their results for the measurement of the construct of job performance because they have included, and/or focused on, additional constructs (e. g., hiring suitability, leadership performance aggregated with leadership satisfaction) or have used student samples in lab experiments. The authors of this article conducted a meta-analysis of job performance measures from field studies. They found that females generally scored slightly higher than males (mean d = –. 11, 80 % credibility interval of –. 33 to. 12). Other analyses suggested that, although job per-formance ratings favored females, ratings of promotion potential were higher for males. Thus, ratings of <b>promotability</b> may deserve further attention as a potential source of differential pro-motion rates. These findings and processes are discussed within the context of EST...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 81 - 91) Ranking, {{the process}} of placing employees in a rank order for making various decisions concerning salary, layoff or <b>promotability</b> / growth potential planning, is an important management activity. In {{order to make a}} decision, the 'value' of the employee to the company must be determined. The determinants of 'value' are different for every decision which needs to be made. Research indicates that no standard method of ranking exists. This thesis proposes a method for ranking. The ranking technique proposed in this thesis was applied to establish a promotability/growth potential ranking of all engineers in a directorate of a division of an aerospace corporation. A committee was established which selected criteria from an exhaustive list of independent criteria which were relevant to the task. The relevant criteria were then weighted by the committee. An employee ranking worksheet was created and completed by the responsible managers and supervisors. The results were accumulated, which provided a means for establishing a ranking of engineers which minimized subjectivity, and provided a basis for comparison of engineers between groups. The technique pointed out specific areas of needed growth for the-employees. Comments from the individuals involved in the study indicated that this process was effective and useful not only as a means for establishing a ranking, but also for evaluating performance...|$|E
40|$|Oxidants are {{ubiquitous}} in our aerobic environment. While {{they are always}} toxic, they can also exert pathophysiological effects at low concentrations and play an etiological role in human disease. For example, oxidants can stimulate cell growth and act as tumor promoters. The cellular antioxidant defense system attenuates the effect of oxidants and consists of low molecular weight components and several enzymes. Most important are catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutases (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase. We are attempting to elucidate the role of CAT and Cu,Zn-SOD in oxidant tumor promotion of mouse epidermal cells JB 6. We {{have found that the}} promotable clone 41 possesses 2 - to 3 -fold higher levels of activity, protein, and stationary mRNA of CAT and Cu,Zn-SOD than does the nonpromotable clone 30. We propose that the growth-stimulatory effect of oxidants is more pronounced in promotable clone 41 because it is better protected from oxidant toxicity. In order to corroborate this model, we have constructed JB 6 cells with higher levels of Cu,Zn-SOD and CAT by transfection with expression vectors containing cDNA for these genes. On the other hand, cells with decreased amounts of Cu,Zn-SOD have been obtained by their stable transfection with a vector containing SOD-cDNA in the antisense orientation. These cell clones with modified antioxidant enzyme complements are being characterized. In particular, their <b>promotability</b> by oxidants and their sensitivity to killing and oxidative macromolecular damage are being measured. Certain tumor promoters that lack oxidizing properties may generate a cellular prooxidant state by a variety of mechanisms. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
