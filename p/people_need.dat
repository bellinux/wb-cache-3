5|$|Laws {{should be}} {{relatively}} stable and not changed too often, as with frequently changing laws {{it may be}} hard for people to keep themselves updated. <b>People</b> <b>need</b> to know what the law is both for short- and long-term planning.|$|E
5|$|Risk to {{defensive}} capabilities: Security {{forces are}} not changing armaments annually, and thus small arms manufacturers need civilians as key customers. Crippling of civilian firearms market would likely lead to end of firearms manufacturing in the Czech Republic. At the same time, familiarity with semi-automatic versions of army rifles by civilians {{is a clear}} defensive advantage in case these <b>people</b> <b>need</b> to be drafted to defend the country.|$|E

25|$|Problematic point(s): <b>people</b> <b>need</b> {{to know if}} {{a phrase}} is officially {{the name of that}} place or just a designation, e.g. Erzsébet híd is a name (‘Elisabeth Bridge’) but Duna-híd merely refers to a bridge on the Danube, so a hyphen should be used.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the citizens waiting for organ transplants in the U.S. and other developed nations, there are long waiting lists {{in the rest of}} the world.

25|$|Some <b>people</b> <b>need</b> to wear special clothes such as {{business}} suits or uniforms {{in their daily}} work. In some cases {{the nature of the}} cycling infrastructure and the prevailing weather conditions may make it very hard to both cycle and maintain the work clothes in a presentable condition. It is argued that such workers can be encouraged to cycle by providing lockers, changing rooms and shower facilities where they can change before starting work.|$|E
25|$|Islam teaches {{children}} and new Muslims the matters of faith, worship, and ethics {{in the form}} of a concise manual. They are popular in Turkish as Ilmihal (from the Arabic Ilm ul-Hal, Situation Science). The first chapter is the book of cleanliness and first to be taught are subjects such as: which are clean, what is clean and what is not clean, what <b>people</b> <b>need</b> to be cleansed from, how they should clean, and which water should they use to clean.|$|E
25|$|Even when {{statistical}} {{techniques are}} correctly applied, {{the results can}} be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise.

25|$|To {{provide the}} kind of {{information}} and support <b>people</b> <b>need</b> to invest money, time and effort in energy conservation, {{it is important to understand}} and link to people's topical concerns. For instance, some retailers argue that bright lighting stimulates purchasing. However, health studies have demonstrated that headache, stress, blood pressure, fatigue and worker error all generally increase with the common over-illumination present in many workplace and retail settings. It has been shown that natural daylighting increases productivity levels of workers, while reducing energy consumption.|$|E
25|$|But a {{continuing}} emphasis to the well-rounded graduate {{can be seen}} in the University's approach to education degrees. As a solely graduate-level program, this is based on the principle that <b>people</b> <b>need</b> to learn primary subject matter well before they can learn how to teach it to others. Thus future teachers at Lehigh often take a five-year program earning both a bachelor's degree in a specialized field and a master's degree in Education. This latter degree, along with the Business College's M.B.A., are among the most popular graduate programs in the University.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} arrangements of alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation symbols on keys. These different keyboard layouts arise mainly because different <b>people</b> <b>need</b> easy access to different symbols, either because they are inputting text in different languages, or because they need a specialized layout for mathematics, accounting, computer programming, or other purposes. The United States keyboard layout is used as default in the currently most popular operating systems: Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The common QWERTY-based layout was designed early in the era of mechanical typewriters, so its ergonomics were compromised to allow for the mechanical limitations of the typewriter.|$|E

25|$|<b>People</b> <b>need</b> to {{be educated}} on {{interpreting}} their results and {{what they should be}} rationally taking from the experience. It is not only the average person who needs {{to be educated}} in the dimensions of their own genomic sequence but also professionals, including physicians and science journalists, who must be provided with the knowledge required to inform and educate their patients and the public. Examples of such efforts include the Personal Genetics Education Project (pgEd), the Smithsonian collaboration with NHGRI, and the MedSeq, BabySeq and MilSeq projects of Genomes to People, an initiative of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000, many free dailies {{have been}} {{introduced}} including three in Hong Kong and three in Vancouver, B.C. Besides Metro, another successful publisher is Norway's Schibsted.

A German version {{had to be taken}} from the market after a bitter newspaper war with local publishers in Cologne, while an Italian edition never saw the streets because of legal matters (non-EU companies could not control Italian media firms, but this did not prevent the Italian market from becoming flooded with free newspapers). The Schibsted editions have a total circulation of 1.7 million.|$|E
