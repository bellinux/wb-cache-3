Moisture is stored in the cortex of the roots, which is protected by a thin <b>periderm.</b> Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall.

This is {{a report on the}} isolation of a potato (Solanum tuberosum) 3 -ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) gene and the study of its molecular and physiological relevance by means of a reverse genetic approach. This gene, called StKCS 6, was stably silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) in potato. Analysis of the chemical composition of silenced potato tuber <b>periderms</b> indicated that StKCS 6 down-regulation has a significant and fairly specific effect on the chain length distribution of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and derivatives, occurring in the suberin polymer and peridermal wax. All compounds with chain lengths of C 28 and higher were significantly reduced in silenced <b>periderms,</b> whereas compounds with chain lengths of C 26 and lower accumulated. Thus, StKCS 6 is preferentially involved in the formation of suberin and wax lipidic monomers with chain lengths of C 28 and higher. As a result, peridermal transpiration of the silenced lines was about 1. 5 -times higher than that of the wild type. Our results convincingly show that StKCS 6 is involved in both suberin and wax biosynthesis and that a reduction of the monomeric carbon chain lengths leads to increased rates of peridermal transpiration...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Pine needle blight of Pinus ponderosa Laws. {{caused by}} Elytroderma deformans (Weir) Darker is {{recognized}} {{by changes in}} the needles, in the bark and {{in the development of}} the branches. Anatomical studies of the host-parasite relation have been made previously on young pine tissue up to four years of age but not on older tissues. Neither has the pattern of invasion been worked out in individual plants. Permanent microsections using standard methods of micro-technique were made on material collected from Round Mountain and from the Pringle Falls Experimental Forest near Bend, Oregon. Normal bark development was studied in noninfected trees from age one through 25. Comparisons made with infected stems revealed: 1. Whereas deep <b>periderms</b> do not occur in uninfected stems up to 25 years old they do occur in infected stems anytime after the second year. The cork cambiums which arise within parenchyma cells of the primary and the secondary phloem in association with hyphal invasion of sieve cells ultimately produce pathological resin canals. Hyphal degeneration results and tissues external to the wound <b>periderms</b> become necrotic. These reactions are generalized responses such as any tissue makes to a foreign agent. However, there is no straight-line relationship between the intensity of tissue response and the severity of the invasion. Z. In stems, hyphae are confined entirely to the sieve cells of the phloem. They may spread vertically within a specified phloem layer and radially from one growth increment to the next. 3. When hyphae invade secondary phloem sieve cells close to the vascular cambium, the vascular cambium is stimulated to produce abnormal parenchyma cells. 4. Phloem horizontal resin canals are more abundant in infected than in noninfected tissue. 5. Sclereids occur in larger groups and more abundantly in both the cortex and the pith of infected stems. 6. Mycelia and microscopic anatomical changes may be present within stems which are macroscopically asymptomatic and bear. green needles. The distribution of hyphae within infected trees was determined by free-hand sections of suppressed ponderosa pine saplings up to 30 years old. Hyphae were found in stem tissue up to 20 -years-old. Evidence is conclusive for hyphal growth from the trunk along branches toward growing tips and is suggestive of growth from apical meristems toward the trunk...|$|R
25|$|Woody dicots {{and many}} nonwoody dicots have {{secondary}} growth originating from their lateral or secondary meristems: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium or phellogen. The vascular cambium forms between the xylem and phloem in the vascular bundles and connects {{to form a}} continuous cylinder. The vascular cambium cells divide to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. As the stem increases in diameter due to production of secondary xylem and secondary phloem, the cortex and epidermis are eventually destroyed. Before the cortex is destroyed, a cork cambium develops there. The cork cambium divides to produce waterproof cork cells externally and sometimes phelloderm cells internally. Those three tissues form the <b>periderm,</b> which replaces the epidermis in function. Areas of loosely packed cells in the <b>periderm</b> that function in gas exchange are called lenticels.|$|E

Severe rot symptoms were developed on the cactus stem discs inoculated with B. cactivora from 5 days after inoculation. However, only small brownish spots developed on the stem discs treated with HICS 2 days prior to the pathogen inoculation. HICS also reduced symptom development on cactus stem discs inoculated with other fungal pathogens such as Alternaria alternata, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, and Fusarium oxysporum, suggesting its disease-inhibitory efficacy may not be pathogen-specific. HICS significantly reduced severities of the stem rot disease on several cactus species including Hylocereus trigonus, Cereus peruvianus, Cham-aecereus silvestrii and Gymnocalycium mianovichii, but not on Cereus tetragonus. Extensive wound <b>periderms</b> were formed in the stem tissues of inoculation and/or wounding sites on C. peruvianus treated with HICS alone or prior to the pathogen inoculation, but not on C. tetragonus, indicating the structural modifications {{may be related to}} the mechanism of disease suppression by HICS. HICS also reduced the disease development on the grafted cactus (H. trigonus stock and G. mianovichii scion) with the control efficacy nearly equivalent to the application of a commercial fungicide.

40|$|The frequency-domain open photoacoustic cell (OPC) {{approach}} {{was used to}} determine room temperature thermal diffusivity of skins (pericarps) from the raw tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculetum Mill.) characterized by the three different stages of ripeness (from immature-green to a mature-red). Periodically interrupted 532 nm laser radiation was used to heat the dry tomato skins, typically 10 mm in diameter and up to 68 µm thick; the modulating frequency f varied from 8 to 150 Hz. Initially, a combined OPC-model that takes into account both, the thermoelastic bending and the effect of thermal diffusion (TD), has been applied. Preliminary results showed that until at least 40 Hz, the effect of TD dominates; above this value the combined model fits the experimental data only poorly. For this reason a less complex OPC-TD {{approach was}} applied to all investigated skins instead, which predicts an exponential decrease for the amplitude of measured photoacoustic signal S with increasing f. For a specimen that is simultaneously opaque and thermally thick, S depends on f as S~exp(-b f 1 / 2) where b is a fitting parameter. The S versus f plot enables one to deduce the numerical value for b which, on its turn allows for the assessment of skin’s thermal diffusivity a.

40|$|Cutin and suberin are the {{two major}} lipid-based {{polymers}} of plants. Cutin is the structural polymer of the epidermal cuticle, the waterproof layer covering primary aerial organs and which is often the structure first encountered by phytopathogens. Suberin contributes to the control of diffusion of water and solutes across internal root tissues and in <b>periderms.</b> The enzymes responsible for assembly of the cutin polymer are largely unknown. We have identified two Arabidopsis acyltransferases essential for cutin biosynthesis, glycerol- 3 -phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) 4 and GPAT 8. Double knockouts gpat 4 /gpat 8 were strongly reduced in cutin and were less resistant to desiccation and to infection by the fungus Alternaria brassicicola. They also showed striking defects in stomata structure including a lack of cuticular ledges between guard cells, highlighting the importance of cutin in stomatal biology. Overexpression of GPAT 4 or GPAT 8 in Arabidopsis increased the content of C 16 and C 18 cutin monomers in leaves and stems by 80 %. In order to modify cutin composition, the acyltransferase GPAT 5 and the cytochrome P 450 -dependent fatty acyl oxidase CYP 86 A 1, two enzymes associated with suberin biosynthesis, were overexpressed. When both enzymes were overexpressed together the epidermal polyesters accumulated new C 20 and C 22 ω-hydroxyacids and α,ω-diacids typical of suberin, and the fine structure and water-barrier function of the cuticle were altered. These results identify GPATs as partners of fatty acyl oxidases in lipid polyester synthesis and indicate that their cooverexpression provides a strategy to probe the role of cutin composition and quantity in the function of plant cuticles...|$|R
40|$|Data are {{presented}} on research in Kenya in 1964 - 1969 on anatomical, mycological, epidemiological, chemical control and cultural aspects of coffee berry disease, Colletotrichum coffeanum Noack, of Coffea arabica L. The pathogen causes flower and berry losses {{and was found}} in branches where it occupied clearly defined areas of the cortex just before or after formation of the first phellogen. Saprophytic Colletotrichum spp. inhabit bark areas with more <b>periderms</b> in the cortex. No relationship {{could be found in}} Kenya between Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Sp. & Schr., the perfect stage of most of the saprophytic Colletotrichum bark components, and C. coffeanum. The seasonal fluctuations in pathogenicity in the bark population of C. coffeanum could be assessed and compared with the total sporulating capacity of the bark population of all Colletotrichum spp. Formerly the level of this total sporulating capacity, or 'inoculum potential' as it was then called, was used as an indication when pre-rain copper sprays had to be applied and how effectively the fungicide had reduced the bark inoculum. Based on these data the recommendations for chemical control were changed from pre-rain fungicide applications, to a spraying regime well into the rainy period, the accent being on protection of the berries rather than on a reduction of the bark inoculum. The fungicide Ortho Difolatan proved to be more effective than copper based compounds. Cultural practices, like the application of high levels of fertilizers, manure and mulch and rigid pruning practices, had no effect on the level of C. coffeanum in branches. Copper containing fungicides pushed the Colletotrichum balance in favour of C. coffeanum. Berries from non-copper sprayed coffee fields were less susceptible to standard conidial suspensions of C. coffeanum than berries from copper sprayed trees. A similar effect of fungicides should be considered in South and Central American coffee growing countries, where the application of fungicides has increased tremendously since the occurrence of Hemileia vastatrix Berk. et Br. in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|The Hirnantian mass {{extinction}} {{was the second}} largest of the Phanerozoic. A global sea level fall resulting from a glaciation on Gondwanaland caused significant changes in ocean circulation patterns and nutrient cycling that is recorded as a worldwide positive δ¹³C excursion. In chapter 2, carbon and nitrogen isotope profiles were reconstructed from two North American carbonate platforms in Nevada {{and one in the}} Yukon with the purpose of gaining a better understanding of proximal to proximal gradients in δ¹³C values from Hirnantian epeiric seaway sediment. Positive δ¹³C excursions are recorded in bulk inorganic and organic carbon fractions from all three sections, and in graptolite <b>periderms</b> from one section. A larger positive excursion is recorded in the proximal sediment (7 ‰) compared to proximal sediment (3 - 4 ‰). This gradient appears to reflect differences in surface water dissolved inorganic carbon δ¹³C values across epeiric seas. These findings are consistent with the carbonate weathering hypothesis, that predicts larger positive δ¹³C shifts in proximal settings of tropical epeiric seas resulting from changes in the local carbon weathering flux caused by the exposure of vast areas of carbonate sediment during glacioeustatic sea level fall and restricted shelf circulation. A 2 ‰ positive excursion in δ¹⁵N is interpreted to result from increased ocean ventilation, greater partitioning of atmospheric oxygen into downwelling surface waters, oxygen minimum zone shrinkage, and declining denitrification rates. This allowed for upwelling of recycled nitrogen with high δ¹⁵N values into the photic zone that forced exported organic matter from the photic zone to higher δ¹⁵N values, consistent with the observed positive shift in δ¹⁵N during the Hirnantian glaciation. This study presents a conceptual model to explain secular changes in δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N during the transition from a greenhouse to icehouse climate. The second focus of this research, presented in chapter 3, was on improving the chemical and analytical methods for δ¹⁸O analysis of biogenic apatites. The technique applies cation exchange chromatography that allows for small sample sizes of apatite (200 µg) to be used for chemical conversion to Ag 3 PO 4. The precision (0. 15 ‰, 1 σ) of δ¹⁸O analysis obtained using a Thermal Conversion Elemental Analyser Continuous Flow – Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (TC/EA CF-IRMS), and the ability to collect multipe isotopes (O, Ca, Sr, REE) using a cation exchange column, makes this technique valuable for high-resolution, multi-isotope studies of biogenic apatites...|$|R
