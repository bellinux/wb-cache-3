50|$|The {{moment they}} got on what was once Route 66, the Knudsons {{realized}} that something was very wrong. The once colorful and often gaudy trading <b>posts,</b> <b>side</b> shows, rare animal displays, motels and cafés were gone. In their place was mile after mile of roadside that {{was little more than}} boarded up buildings. Many stretches of roadbed were poorly maintained or completely closed to traffic. Entire towns that were once bustling tourist meccas were all but shut down.|$|R
50|$|On the South African side of {{the border}} the N1 Highway connects this border post to the main {{economic}} centres of Pretoria (463 km) and Johannesburg (521 km).

A railway also passes through this border <b>post,</b> <b>side</b> by side with the road, and splits into a line to Bulawayo and a line to Gweru via Rutenga.|$|R

50|$|Enclosed pole {{buildings}} have exterior curtain walls formed by girts {{fastened to the}} exterior of the posts at intervals about 2 ft on center that carry the siding and any interior load. The walls may be designed as a shear wall to provide structural stability. Other girt systems include framing in between the posts rather than on the outer <b>side</b> of the <b>posts.</b> <b>Siding</b> materials for a pole building are most commonly rolled-rib 29-gauge enameled steel cut to length in 32 or 36 in widths attached using color-matched screws with rubber washers to seal the holes. However, any standard siding can be used, including T1-11, vinyl, lap siding, cedar and even brick. Using sidings other than metal may require first installing sheathing, such plywood, oriented strand board or boards.|$|R

50|$|Milecastle 50TW {{measured}} 20.12 m x 16.76 m (long-axis type). The ramparts measured 6.1 m at the base.

40|$|An {{important}} {{feature in the}} design of superhydrophobic surfaces is their robustness against collapse from the Cassie-Baxter configuration to the Wenzel state. Upon such a transition a surface loses its properties of low adhesion and friction. We describe how to adapt the Surface Evolver algorithm to predict the parameters and mechanism of the collapse transition on posts of arbitrary shape. In particular, contributions to the free energy evaluated over the solid-liquid surface are reduced to line integrals to give good convergence. The algorithm is validated for straight, vertical and inclined, posts. Numerical results for curved posts with a horizontal section at their ends show that these are more efficient in stabilising the Cassie state than straight posts, and identify whether the interface first depins from the <b>post</b> <b>sides</b> or the <b>post</b> tips.
