40|$|Cellular core {{networks}} carry traffic between {{base stations}} and the Internet {{on behalf of}} user equipment (UE) (see Figure 1 (a)). The network relies on specialized equipment such as serving gateways (S-GWs) that provide seamless mobility when UEs move between base stations, and <b>packet</b> <b>gateways</b> (P-GWs) that perform {{a wide variety of}} functions like traffic monitoring and billing, access control, and parental controls. The current architecture of cellular core networks are remarkably complex and inflexible [1, 2], an unfortunate legacy of their circuit-switched origins. Centralizing critical data-plane functionality at the boundary with the Internet forces all traffic to flow through the packet gateway—including device-to-device traffic. With so much functionality in one box, <b>packet</b> <b>gateways</b> are complex and expensive, and force carriers to buy functionality they do not need. Indeed, carriers cannot “mix and match ” capabilities from different vendors (e. g., a firewall from one vendor, and a transcoder from another), or “scale up ” the resources devoted to a specific function [2, 3]. Since the <b>packet</b> <b>gateways</b> are hard to change, carriers are forced to replace them to deploy new functionality, even when the existing equipment suffices for most purposes. To make matters worse, growing link speeds and more diverse network policies will put even greater strain on <b>packet</b> <b>gateways.</b> Cellular networks can apply customized policies based {{on a wide variety of}} subscriber attributes as well as on the application [2].

30|$|Distributed {{mobility}} management (DMM). DMM is a {{an architectural}} framework for evolving mobile IP services from the currently deployed mobile core networks (which have serious scalability/reliability issues {{due to their}} hierarchical centralized architecture) to a more scalable model with distributed operations[127, 181]. Current IP mobility frameworks force a mobile network operator (MNO) to deploy central entities (like the home agent, local mobility anchor, <b>packet</b> <b>gateway,</b> etc.) in charge of coordinating the mobility management. The current architecture suffers from the problems of suboptimal routing, lack of scalability, and lack of reliability. SDN-based solutions {{can be used to}} implement a partially distributed model in which the control plane and data planes are managed separated. The split of control/data plane using SDN principle allows mobility anchors to optimally route traffic[181].|$|R
30|$|There {{are a few}} {{problems}} with the current LTE architecture: i) centralized data flow as all the data passes through the <b>packet</b> <b>gateway</b> (P-GW), ii) centralized monitoring and control is not scalable and is expensive, and iii) base stations and infrastructure are difficult to configure. The first two problems are related with the central control and monitoring of LTE networks. Thus, a possible solution would need to distribute some of the control and monitoring responsibilities leading to a hybridized control plane. This {{seems to be a}} departure from one of the fundamental principles of SDNs, i.e., centralized control. Solution to the third problem lies in adapting an SDN-based architecture so that remote applications may be used for the tasks. As discussed earlier, OpenRadio provides an ideal modular interface to configure base stations remotely and conveniently.|$|R

We propose six different heuristics for load balancing, including one based on entropy called EBA. The entropy function provides an accurate measure {{of the difference in}} the load on the gateways.

Therefore, the users experience many issues because of a congestion and overload at an access network such as low throughput, long latencies and network outages. Current network operator’s solutions, such as capping data usage and throttling a connection speed, {{have a negative effect}} on the user satisfaction. Therefore, alternative solutions are needed such as Access Point (AP) -based complementary network. In this paper, we use WiFi as a complementary network to Long-Term Evolution (LTE).

40|$|Abstract—We {{present an}} {{architecture}} for combining two established network paradigms, IP and Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN), into a unified <b>packet</b> <b>gateway</b> design that leverages {{the advantages of}} both. Vehicular networking (VNET) scenarios often involve brittle links between communicating nodes due to their mobility. DTN solutions, by using a dynamic hop-by-hop delivery model instead of the end-to-end IP model, are able to sustain a large class of applications despite intermittent links. As a defining characteristic, our design is application-transparent in that it requires no changes to host applications (or the underlying host protocol stacks) {{in order for them}} to use DTN transport when IP is not feasible. In addition, we build into the architecture an explicit disruption notification service for keeping users informed as well preventing application time-outs during an IP outage. Finally, given the wide range of behaviors exhibited by applications that can benefit from DTN, our design supports the notion of an application lattice to allow operators to customize, on a per application/group/protocol basis, how the switch between IP and DTN and the disruption notification are performed. A preliminary evaluation based on a C++ proof-of-concept implementation has illustrated several potential benefits of the proposed architecture for VNET applications. I...|$|R
40|$|Data {{collection}} {{is a fundamental}} task of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) to support a variety of applications, such as remote monitoring, and emergency response, where collected information is relayed to an infrastructure network via <b>packet</b> <b>gateways</b> for processing and decision making. In large-scale monitoring scenarios, data packets need to be relayed over multi-hop paths to the gateways, and sensors are often randomly deployed, causing local node density differences. As a result, imbalance in data traffic load on the gateways is likely to occur. Furthermore, due to dynamic network conditions and differences in sensor data generation rates, congestion on some data paths is also often experienced. Numerous {{studies have focused on}} the problem of in-network traffic load balancing, while a few works have aimed at equalizing the loads on gateways. However, there is a potential trade-off between these two problems. In this paper, the dual objective of gateway and in-network load balancing is addressed and the RALB (Reactive and Adaptive Load Balancing) algorithm is presented. RALB is proposed as a generic solution for multihop networks and mesh topologies, especially in large-scale remote monitoring scenarios, to balance traffic loads...|$|R
