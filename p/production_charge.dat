Within 6 -day of operation at + 0. 4 V vs. Ag vertical bar AgCl and starting with 35 mM of lactate, consistently the electrical <b>charge</b> <b>production</b> under the aerobic condition was higher than that under the anaerobic condition. In all the experimental runs, the values of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) production {{were found to be}} correlated positively and significantly with the <b>charge</b> <b>production,</b> but the highest Coulombic efficiency of 18 % was observed under the anaerobic conditions without ammonia addition while the lowest <b>charge</b> <b>production</b> occurred. Those results indicate that NADH production enhanced by oxygen {{is the leading cause of}} the increase of the <b>charge</b> <b>production,</b> but the biomass production and the oxygen reduction would both consume NADH electrons and lead to lower electron recoveries. In addition, whether under constant aerobic or anaerobic, or alternating aerobic/anaerobic conditions, chronoamperometric results made it possible to rule out other factors, like lactate uptake rate or cell growth, which might increase the <b>charge</b> <b>production</b> under aerobic conditions. By using high performance liquid chromatography, some diffusive flavins (e. g., 0. 5 mu M of riboflavin) were found under the aerobic condition, but were not found under the anaerobic one. However, from results of cyclic voltammetry (CV), the signals of flavins were found to be approximately the same under both conditions. Although it is inferred that oxygen renders the flavins secreted extracellularly, that is not the major effect of oxygen for boosting the <b>charge</b> <b>production.</b> Furthermore, bound flavins under anaerobic condition were found to be effectively electrocatalytic according to sigmoidal CV result.
