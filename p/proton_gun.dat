50|$|The captain {{learned of}} the failure to destroy the north pole base and have {{rendezvous}} with Tempest Jr. They then set sail to N9 in order to upgrade the warship before making plans to destroy the north pole base. En route to N9, they destroyed the biggest Death Force sea fortress in the Panama Canal by using the Anti <b>Proton</b> <b>Gun.</b> After some sojourn in the Amazon, they were finally able to reach research center N9 in Bermuda.|$|E
50|$|Depending {{on which}} version is played, the player {{controls}} Mickey Mouse, Peter Venkman, or Garfield. The game emphasizes puzzle-solving in a dungeon-like atmosphere. To advance to each new stage, the player has to collect stars, which {{open the door}} to the next level. In the North American version, the player has a <b>proton</b> <b>gun</b> instead of a pneumatic hammer, but it's only effective on blocks at the character's feet, not on the ghosts, which must be destroyed with bombs. If the player character loses all his health (by touching damaging things like ghosts, flames, and reforming blocks), or the 999 second timer winds down to zero, he loses a life.|$|E
5000|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Good Girls" [...] {{was directed by}} Dano Cerny and premiered July 13, 2016. It takes place first in a haunted laundromat and later in a dive bar, where King can be seen playing pool, smoking a cigar, and arm wrestling. King dyed her hair blue for the video, with the makeup artist responsible for the clip, Michelle Clark, describing {{the goal of the}} visual styling as [...] "badass." [...] Tying in the film concept, King's character dispatches a handful of ghosts with the franchise's signature <b>proton</b> <b>gun.</b> Towards the end of the video, clips of the film are showcased.|$|E
40|$|Current {{knowledge}} of antimatter {{has been a}} road block for the real understanding of antimatter. Currently antimatter is generated with high energy devices (colliders and <b>proton</b> <b>guns).</b> Used energies are just too big. Excited anti-particle’s are very hard to handle. ToEbi and Antimatter The Theory of Everything by illusion [1] gives deeper knowledge and tools for cheap antimatter “production”. The key is spinning orientation of particle. Based on ToEbi, matter and antimatter particles push each other away (III Law). That information alone opens huge opportunities. Rotation phenomenon extends itself on stellar objects as well. Different spin directions between galaxies explains why Universe has an increasing expansion rate, in other words, no need for dark energy. Because of different spin directions, matter and antimatter won’t contact and annihilate too easily. The weak spot of particles is their rotation axi...|$|R
40|$|Current {{knowledge}} of antimatter {{has been a}} roadblock for the real under-standing of antimatter. Antimatter is generated with high energy devices like particle colliders and <b>proton</b> <b>guns.</b> But those devices are definitely not needed because particle is its antiparticle, {{it all depends on}} particle’s spin vector. ToEbi and Antimatter Theory of Everything by illusion (ToEbi) [1] gives deeper knowledge and effec-tive method for antimatter utilization. Key component in annihilation process is the spin vector orientation between particles. Based on ToEbi, particle and its antiparticle push each other away (II Law of ToEbi).

50|$|The main {{equipment}} {{used by the}} Ghostbusters to capture ghosts is the proton pack: a reportedly unlicensed nuclear accelerator which fires a proton stream that polarizes with the negatively charged energy of a ghost, allowing it {{to be held in}} the stream while active. The proton packs' particle throwers were originally portrayed as wands worn on each arm. In current versions, it consists of a hand-held wand (neutrino wand as described and scripted by Aykroyd, also called a <b>proton</b> <b>gun</b> or particle thrower within the franchise) connected to a backpack-sized particle accelerator. The Proton Stream can also fire a hard-hitting boson dart which can be fired alone or collided with the Proton Stream to fire a Boson Collider.|$|E
50|$|Colin and {{his classmates}} and Anna {{were allowed to}} be part of Blue Noah's crew by serving in Tempest Junior. After a couple of skirmishes with the Death Force - the {{military}} arm of Gotham headed by Colonel Jrgens (Colonel Lupus in the English dub), Blue Noah saw the wreckage of a fighter plane containing an unnamed pilot. They rescued the pilot from the wreckage and brought him to Blue Noah for medical treatment. After destroying a Death Force sea fortress using the anti <b>proton</b> <b>gun,</b> the pilot who was rescued from the wreckage came about and talked to Captain Noah. He told the captain that he is Flight Lieutenant Domingo from research center N9 and he was ordered to go to N1 to meet Blue Noah and inform them that they should proceed to N9 in order to upgrade Blue Noah with an Aero Conversion Engine which would make the warship capable of outer space flight.|$|E
50|$|The red {{and gold}} armor was {{composed}} of an ultra-fine 3-D knit alloy and incorporated motors into the knitting to allow full mobility. The armor also included a stealth mode. While it ran on {{the same type of}} power, the power consumption was much more efficient. The boot jets were upgraded to chemically fueled thrusters, which provided a much faster flight speed. Weaponry consisted of the chest-mounted Mk II Monobeam (useful range was still only several yards), repulsor rays, a <b>proton</b> <b>gun,</b> and powerful electromagnets to pull metal objects to him or repel/push them away. Communications and sensors consisted of a short-wave radio. Other features included an image reproducer and collapsible roller skates. Most functions were controlled by miniature electronic switches mounted on the insides of various pieces of the armor such as the helmet and the gloves; by pressing various combinations of them, different systems were engaged. The switches in the helmet were enabled by the wearer's tongue; other functions were enabled by wrist-mounted controls.|$|E
5000|$|The proton pack, {{designed}} by Dr. Egon Spengler, is a man-portable particle accelerator {{system that is}} used to create a charged particle beam—composed of protons—that is fired by the <b>proton</b> <b>gun</b> (also referred to as the [...] "neutron wand"). Described in the first movie as a [...] "positron collider", it functions by colliding high-energy positrons to generate its proton beam. The beam allows a Ghostbuster to contain and hold [...] "negatively charged ectoplasmic entities". This containment ability allows the wielder to position a ghost above a trap for capture. The name proton pack is not used in the original movie at all, and is not used until the subway tunnel scene in Ghostbusters II, when Egon says that they should get their proton packs. The doorman to the Mayor's mansion also uses the term proton pack, asking the Ghostbusters if he can buy one from them for his little brother. Egon replies that [...] "A proton pack is not a toy".|$|E
5000|$|In the story, the ghost-hunting weapons wielded by the Ghostbusters, or [...] "proton packs", {{consisted}} of a portable cyclotron worn as a backpack by each Ghostbuster, capable of releasing a stream of directed protons through a neutrona wand, or <b>proton</b> <b>gun,</b> which counteracts the [...] "negatively-charged ectoplasmic energy" [...] of a ghost or similar creature. The packs were designed by Design consultant Stephen Dane, who [...] "went home and got foam pieces and just threw a bunch of stuff together to get the look. It was highly machined {{but it had to}} look off-the-shelf and military surplus." [...] The actual fiberglass props used by the actors were created by special effects supervisor Chuck Gaspar, based on Dane's design. Gaspar used rubber molds to create identical fiberglass shells, attached them to aluminum back plates and Army surplus ALICE (All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment) frames. Each pack weighed about thirty pounds (13.6 kg), and nearly fifty (22.6 kg) with the batteries installed, and strained the actors' backs during the long shoots. Lightweight packs made of foam rubber were used for stunt work. The PKE meter prop was built using an Iona SP-1 handheld shoe polisher as a base, to which lights and advanced-looking electronics were affixed.|$|E
50|$|Blue Noah {{along with}} its three {{companion}} space ships then flew to outer space in order to confront Terror Star itself orbiting above the planet Earth. Hegeler and Jrgens were pleading with Leader Zytel (General Z) in order to send more reinforcements to Earth in order to destroy Blue Noah when they learned that it is headed for Terror Star. Battle after battle ensued with Blue Noah firing the Anti <b>Proton</b> <b>Gun</b> in order to destroy all the enemy warships and damage Terror Star itself. Hegeler told Zytel that they should just look for a new planet since {{they will not be}} able to conquer Earth. Zytel vehemently rejects the idea. During this time, Hegeler learned through his scout that most of the 200 million Gotham citizens of Terror Star are dead because of a flaw in the design of the satellite causing the life support systems to fail. He then concluded that the reason why Zytel decided to stay on Earth and make it their new home is because the satellite can no longer go further to look for a new planet more hospitable to Gothamites because of this flaw in the design. Zytel intended to make Earth the dream planet in order to cover up for the flaw in Terror Star's design even if Earth was not the ideal planet for their people.|$|E
