50|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>adhesive</b> tapes usually {{require a}} light {{pressure}} to ensure bonding with a substrate. This low pressure requirement allows easy application to surfaces by simply using fingers or hands to apply pressure. The pressure {{applied to the}} tape allows the tape to have better contact with the surface and allows the physical forces between the two to build up. Usually, increased application pressure increases the bond of the adhesive to the substrate. PSA tape laboratory testing is often conducted with a 2 kg roller to increase test uniformity. PSAs are able to maintain their tackiness at room temperature and do not {{require the use of}} additives such as water, solvents, or heat activation to exert strong adhesive forces on surfaces. Due to this PSAs are capable of being applied to a variety of surfaces such as paper, plastics, wood, cement, and metal. The adhesives have a cohesive holding and are also elastic allowing PSAs to be manipulated by hand and also be removed from a surface without leaving behind any residue.|$|E

50|$|In the past, the {{greatest}} complaint with prosthetics is not having secure adherence. When prostheses are not adhered securely, satisfaction of prostheses is significantly decreased. In {{a survey conducted}} approximately two years after receiving the prostheses, only 67% of respondents “benefited” and only 39% still used them (Janes S 2005). Adhesion of prostheses depends greatly on the materials and fabrication techniques. Presently common are self-adhering prostheses (mass-produced) which adhere well initially, but the adhesion weakens over a few months. Another common method of adhesion is to apply an organic based <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>adhesive</b> to the prosthesis for each use. However, removing the adhesive is difficult and can easily tear the thin edges of the prosthesis. Most promising though is a fabrication technique where the silicone prostheses are bonded to {{a thin layer of}} polyurethane. A water-based acrylic rubber adhesive is applied to the polyurethane, and the prostheses could be adhered to the skin for up to two weeks at a time. Removing the adhesive from the prostheses is fairly simple and is done with an alcohol swab. The edges of the prostheses remain thin and durable due to the polyurethane layer. Additionally, the water-based adhesive is gentle on the skin and is indicated for irradiated skin.|$|E

40|$|Purpose We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effect of solubility param-eter and drug concentration on the rheological behaviour of drug-in-adhesive films intended for transdermal application. Methods Films were prepared over a range of drug concentra-tions (5 %, 10 % and 20 % w/w) using ibuprofen, benzoic acid, nicotinic acid and lidocaine as model drugs in acrylic (Duro-Tak 87 - 4287 and Duro-Tak 87900 A) or silicone (Bio-PSA 7 - 4301 and Bio-PSA 7 - 4302) <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>adhesives</b> (PSAs). Saturation status of films was determined using light microscopy. Viscoelastic parameters were measured in rheology tests at 32 °C. Results Subsaturated films had lower viscoelastic moduli where-as saturated films had higher moduli than the placebo films and/or a concentration-dependent increase in their modulus. Saturation concentration of each drug in the films was reflected by decreasing/ increasing viscoelastic patterns. The viscoelastic windows (VWs) of the adhesive and drug-in-adhesive films clearly depicted the effect of solubility parameter differences, molar concentration of drug in the adhesive film and differences in PSA chemistry. Conclusions Drug solubility parameters and molar drug concen-trations {{have an impact on}} rheological patterns and thus on the adhesive performance of tested <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>adhesives</b> intended for use in transdermal drug delivery systems.

40|$|Historically tape {{properties}} such as peel adhesion, shear and tack {{have been}} used to characterize the perfor-mance of <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>adhesives</b> targeted for transdermal applications; however, variability from the test methods often resulted in wide specification limits and poor correlation of test data with adhesive performance. In addition, although these tests could qualitatively predict how quickly a system would bond to the skin, how easily the system would resist cold flow and how much force would be required to remove the system from the skin, these tests did not accurately measure how well the systems would wear. In order to better understand and predict the wear performance of transdermal systems, an understanding of the viscoelastic response of the bulk adhesive, the surface energies of both the adhesive and the adherend and the influence of the backing substrate must be developed. Within the last couple of decades, rheology has emerged as a new and innovative technique for not only charac-terizing viscoelastic properties of polymers, but for also predicting wear performance properties of <b>pressure</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>adhesives</b> (1 - 5) and as shown below, {{attempts have been made to}} correlate traditional tape properties with rheological responses: In the early 1980 ’s, Dow Corning personnel began investigating different rheological tools for characterizing silicone adhesive performance.
