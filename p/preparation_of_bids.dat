40|$|Construction {{estimating}} {{works as}} the basis for various strategic decisions regarding the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>bid</b> proposals, procurement plans, various levels of schedules, and job cost control. Under the highly risky environment of the prevalent competitive <b>bidding</b> practice, <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> realistic estimates pertaining to those management decisions has been a complex task that is often performed on an ad hoc and piecemeal manner. Conventional procedures and tools have proved inadequate to provide a structured decision aid that, under such environment, maximizes the contractor's chances of winning a job with maximum potential profit, and further generates practical baseline plans needed for job control to maintain this profit. Yet the situation has been translated into a high percentage of business failures, a high potential for claims, and at best a low profit margin in the industry. This research presents a methodology for an integrated cost estimation and bid preparation, with emphasis on the assessment <b>of</b> <b>bidding</b> risks and optimum markup estimation. The methodology utilizes available tools (algorithms, database management systems, and Al-based techniques) that can benefit from current industry practice and provide an adequate decision aid during bid preparation. The methodology facilitates integration among estimating, planning and scheduling, and bid unbalancing. It incorporates enhancements to the various functions that cover the quantitative aspects of an estimate including: direct and indirect cost estimation, planning and scheduling, and resource utilization. This enables detailed estimates of costs and durations to be generated for all the project tasks, with minimal redundancy and in less time. Such estimates also establish the baselines needed for efficient job control. For practicality, the methodology accounts for the qualitative (risk-related) factors that {{play a vital role in}} the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> competitive <b>bid</b> proposals (e. g., competition, market conditions, and contractor keenness for the job). The methodology utilizes Neural Networks, an Al-based technique that employs a learning mechanism and emulates the human ability to solve pattern recognition tasks similar to many problems encountered in construction. This technique is introduced as a new tool to the industry, incorporating several potential applications. A neural network model is designed and used to arrive at an optimum markup value that maximizes that contractor's potential profit and predicts the probability of winning the job at such level of profit, in response to the project risk pattern. The methodology then utilizes the data obtained through the detailed estimate to optimally unbalance the final bid, in an effort to improve the contractor's cash flow while maintaining his competitiveness. A PC-based prototype is developed to automate the bid preparation process and an example application is presented in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed methodology. The proposed integrated methodology contributes to current automation efforts in construction and its modular architecture allows for further enhancement and expansions. The developments made with respect to the markup estimation problem demonstrates the powerful capabilities of neural networks and the potential benefits of deriving analogy-based solutions to complicated construction problems that are characterized by high uncertainty. This approach could readily be utilized in other domains in construction management where solutions are based primarily on holistic analogy and traditional algorithmic solutions are inadequat...|$|R

40|$|Embedded {{consensus}} has characterised the behaviour of the European Parliament {{since its}} foundation in the 1950 s. This research tests the path dependence of consensus {{during the period}} of 1994 to 2002, {{in the light of the}} changing institutional powers of the Parliament. It challenges existing theory and empirical evidence drawn mainly from roll call votes that has concluded that the European Parliament has become more competitive internally in response to increased institutional powers. There are three causal factors that reinforce consensus: the need to reconcile national and ideological divisions within a multinational political system; the pull of external institutional factors such as institutional change or the separation of powers; and internal incentives for collusion between political actors influenced by the need to accommodate the interests of the national elites present at the level of the European Union. Switzerland, a multiple cleavage system of decentralised federalism that includes consociational characteristics and a separation of powers, provides a comparative reference point for institutionalised consensus. The hypotheses of institutionalised consensus are tested empirically in four ways: 1) by roll call votes between 1994 and 2001, focusing on procedure, policy area, and the cut-off point of the 1999 elections; 2) competition and consensus in the distribution of policy-related office in the Parliament; 3) by Parliament’s use of its powers of appointment and censure over other institutions; and 4) by the internal consensus on the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> Parliament’s <b>bids</b> for greater powers when the European Union Treaties are reformed. In adapting the theory of path dependence to a multinational legislature, the methodology presented in this thesis can be applied in furthering the understanding of other comparable institutions.
