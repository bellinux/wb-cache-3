50|$|Because of {{the rise}} in {{popularity}} of XML SOAP based services, SAML attribute assertions are now more popular than X.509 ACs for transporting user attributes. However, they both have similar functionality, which is to strongly bind a set of <b>privilege</b> <b>attributes</b> to a user.|$|E
50|$|An X.509 AC is a {{generalisation}} of {{the well}} known X.509 public key certificate (PKC), in which the public key of the PKC {{has been replaced by}} any set of attributes of the certificate holder (or subject). Therefore, one could in theory use X.509 ACs to hold a user's public key as well as any other attribute of the user. (In a similar vein, X.509 PKCs {{can also be used to}} hold <b>privilege</b> <b>attributes</b> of the subject, by adding them to the subject directory attributes extension of an X.509 PKC). However, the life cycle of public keys and user privileges are usually very different, and therefore it isn't usually a good idea to combine both of them in the same certificate. Similarly, the authority that assigns a privilege to someone is usually different from the authority that certifies someone's public key. Therefore, it isn't usually a good idea to combine the functions of the SoA/AA and the CA in the same trusted authority. PMIs allow privileges and authorisations to be managed separately from keys and authentication.|$|E
40|$|Certificates {{have long}} been used to bind {{authorization}} information to an identity or public key. Essentially {{there are two ways}} in which a verifying authority (reference monitor) can obtain the information (from a certificate) that is required to make an access control decision: the requesting entity provides the <b>privilege</b> <b>attributes</b> to the verifying authority – a ‘push ’ model; or the verifying authority obtains the <b>privilege</b> <b>attributes</b> from a trusted repository – a ‘pull’ model. In this paper we argue that a push model, which is used by most certificate-based authorization mechanisms, is inferior to a pull model, and present an architecture based on the pull model...|$|E
50|$|Another {{component}} {{that is very}} close to the base components is called a resource manager. It is responsible for applying security policy to resources. The policy enforcer component directs the request to the authorization service for evaluation. Based on the authorization service result (approval or denial) the resource manager allows or denies access to the protected resources. Access Manager authorization decisions are based upon the <b>Privilege</b> <b>Attribute</b> Certificate (PAC), which is created for each user authenticated in an Access Manager environment, regardless of the authentication mechanism used.|$|R
50|$|The private class data {{design pattern}} seeks to reduce {{exposure}} of attributes by limiting their visibility. It reduces {{the number of}} class attributes by encapsulating them in single Data object. It allows the class designer to remove write <b>privilege</b> of <b>attributes</b> that are intended to be set only during construction, even from methods of the target class.|$|R
50|$|The ROAP {{protocol}} suite enables communication between a Rights Issuing (RI) entity and a DRM Agent resident in the user device. Rights, permissions, <b>privileges</b> and other <b>attributes</b> are encapsulated into object oriented (OO) entities called Rights Objects (RO).|$|R
40|$|Part 5 : Autonomous ManagementInternational audienceThe {{autonomic}} {{management of}} federated authorization infrastructures (federations) {{is seen as}} a means for improving the monitoring and use of a service provider’s resources. However, federations are comprised of independent management domains with varying scopes of control and data ownership. The focus of this paper is on the autonomic management of federated identity providers by service providers located in other domains, when the identity providers have been diagnosed as the source of abuse. In particular, we describe how an autonomic controller, external to the domain of the identity provider, exercises control over the issuing of <b>privilege</b> <b>attributes.</b> The paper presents a conceptual design and implementation of an effector for an identity provider that is capable of enabling cross-domain autonomic management. The implementation of an effector for a SimpleSAMLphp identity provider is evaluated by demonstrating how an autonomic controller, together with the effector, is capable of responding to malicious abuse...|$|E
50|$|Within {{the city}} of Armethelieh, every citizen of the city must wear a golden City Talisman. This object signifies that the {{individual}} wearing it is a full citizen {{of the city and}} is therefore entitled to the rights and <b>privileges</b> <b>attributed</b> to its wear. What is known only to the Mages and not the general public, is that the Talismans also serve as batteries of magical energy. They slowly drain the, for most {{of the members of the}} city, unused magical energies housed in every creature. Every new moon, by law of the city, the Talismans must be turned in to the temple and replaced with a new Talisman. This is the source of the Mages' power, circumventing the need to take upon themselves the personal costs of using their magic. The Mages see it as their right to take and use without the citizens knowledge, because the City and its citizens benefit so much from the magics. It is similar to the key stones used by Wild Mages with the difference being that the key stones are charged by the individual or by other creatures freely, and the city absorbs the powers without the citizens' consent.|$|R
50|$|Rights Object Acquisition Protocol is a {{suite of}} XML-based Digital Rights Management (DRM) {{security}} protocols which enables Open Mobile Alliance-conformant user devices to request and acquire viewing and/or editing rights, permissions, <b>privileges</b> and other <b>attributes</b> from a Rights Issuer.

40|$|The study, {{focused on}} the European Union law, deals with the puzzling {{relationship}} between the prohibition of every discrimination founded on sex in employment (and social) matters (art. 157 TFEU, secondary EU law, and art. 23 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights) and the faculty, now recognized to the Member States by primary European law (art. 157 par. 4 TFEU, art. 23, par. 2 of the EU Charter) to provide the under-represented sex with special (compensatory) advantages. The question discussed in the essay is whether the case law of the European Court of Justice deems these "positive actions" as a normative exception to the prohibition of every discrimination (therefore of restrictive interpretation) or as a normative expression of the general principle of equality. At present the case law suggests an holistic approach. The equality principle, in that vein, is structured not only in a negative, but in a positive dimension too. The unwritten European Union law recognizes a substantial or "true" meaning of the equality, whose fulfilment is entrusted to the national (or European) legislator. However the negative dimension of the principle mandates a careful delimitation of the special <b>privilege</b> <b>attributed</b> to the under-represented sex, and may conveniently force (by virtue of the substantial strand of the equality) its extension to the disadvantaged person of the opposite sex...|$|R
25|$|While the Byzantine Pronoia was the {{dominant}} {{form in the}} country, the Angevins introduced the Western type of feudalism. In the 13th and 14th centuries, pronoiars earned {{a great number of}} <b>privileges</b> and <b>attributes,</b> taking power away from the central authority. The benefit earned by the pronoiars from their land increased. Pronoiars began to collect land taxes for themselves which was an attribute of the state. They also began to exercise administrative authorities which replaced the state's, such as the ability to gather workers, guards, soldiers, and sometimes their own judges. In the 13th century, it was common for pronoiars to arrogate their own right to trial, initially for petty issues and then for serious crimes, taking away central authority from the main prerogatives to the practice of sovereignty.|$|R
40|$|Most {{mobile agent}} systems use {{internal}} data structures within an agent {{to control and}} specify its security requirements and properties. These structures typically contain authorization information regarding access to computational resources on distributed systems and conceptually serve as an internal passport for the agent. While these structures are often very similar semantically, they differ greatly in their implementation, depending {{to a large extent}} on the mechanisms used to protect their contents. This paper considers a general scheme for managing <b>privileges</b> using <b>attribute</b> certificates. An attribute certificate can be viewed as an external, digitally signed agent passport, which allows greater flexibility in meeting the needs of an application and overlaying a suitable management scheme. The paper presents the benefits of this approach and gives an example of how an agent system could be enhanced with this mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Getting rid of Positional Faithfulness in {{stressed}} positions: the phonetic {{underpinnings of}} prosodic conditioning This paper starts from a striking observation about stress-conditioned phonological processes: although {{a variety of}} processes {{are sensitive to the}} presence or absence of stress, the features targeted by these processes are extremely few. This fact poses significant problems for previous accounts of prosodic conditioning (Positional Faithfulness, Beckman, 1998, henceforth Pos-Faith). The paper lays out the problem and proposes an alternative account of possible interactions between stress and segmental structure. The key proposal is that faithfulness to the contents of stressed positions must be eliminated. The grammar of prosodically conditioned processes is not determined be the special status attributed to privileged positions. Instead, prosodic conditioning arises from the grammatical pressures imposed by the need to generate louder vowels and longer stressed units. These grammatical pressures target exclusively the auditory properties of stressed vowels and adjacent consonants. Previous analyses of stress-conditioned processes claim that stressed positions have positional privileges, shared with other strong positions (e. g. the root, the initial syllable, etc). The positional <b>privilege</b> <b>attributed</b> by Pos-Faith to stressed positions results in their ability to resist phonological processes. The positional privilege is implemented in the grammar by the action of Pos-Faith constraints (IDENT-σ (F)), where F represents any phonological feature. It is therefore predicted that any phonological feature can show Pos-Faith effects, if it occurs in a stressed position. A study of the documented cases of stress-conditioned phonological processes (a. o. Smith, 2002; Gonzalez, 2003; deLacy, 2006; Bye and deLacy, 2008) reveals a very different picture. Duration aside, among consonantal features stress-sensitive processes target only the laryngeal and manner features in (1 a). Place is never specifically targeted in stress or unstressed positions, nor are the other manner and laryngeal features, (1 b). (1) a. Consonantal features affected by stress:- Laryngeal features: aspiration in voiceless stops, glottalization in stops and resonants, [±voice...|$|R

30|$|The above schemes {{have laid}} solid {{foundations}} for filling {{the gap between}} theoretical proposal and practical application of ABS. However, in the above schemes, the attribute authority has the ultimate privilege in the system. Even worse, it can forge as any legal users and generates a valid signature. Once the attribute authority become dishonest, the system will be exposed to potential risks. Although ABS with multiple attribute authorities has been proposed in [16], if these attribute authorities collude {{with each other to}} obtain a user’s private key, a legal signature can still be successfully forged. Thus, it is of significance to cut down the <b>privilege</b> of the <b>attribute</b> authority in ABS systems.|$|R
50|$|As {{discussed}} by Paula Rothernberg in her novel Invisible Privilege: A Memoir About Race, Class, and Gender, male privilege often takes institutionalized and embedded forms from which men may directly benefit. These instances of male <b>privilege</b> systems may <b>attribute</b> to male over empowerment {{and can help}} explain man’s sense of centrality {{in some of the}} most powerful institutions. An example of male privilege in institutionalized academic settings can be observed by the prevalence of men in how curriculums are formed and history and literature is taught across the United States. Historically, all those who have held the title of President of the United States have been male. American government on the national level, including the United States Senate and the United States Congress, is also predominantly male.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Android is a fast {{evolving}} system, {{with new}} updates coming out one after another. These updates often completely overhaul a running system, replacing and adding tens of thou-sands of files across Android’s complex architecture, {{in the presence}} of critical user data and applications (apps for short). To avoid accidental damages to such data and existing apps, the upgrade process involves complicated program logic, whose security implications, however, are less known. In this paper, we report the first systematic study on the Android updating mechanism, focusing on its Package Management Service (PMS). Our research brought to light a new type of security-critical vulnerabilities, called Pileup flaws, through which a malicious app can strategically declare a set of <b>privileges</b> and <b>attributes</b> on a low-version operating system (OS) and wait until it is upgraded to escalate its privileges on the new system. Specifically, we found that by exploiting the Pileup vulnerabilities, the app can not only acquire a set of newly added system and signature permissions but also determine their settings (e. g., protection levels), and it can further substitute for new system apps, contaminate their data (e. g., cache, cookies of Android default browser) to steal sensitive user information or change security configurations, and prevent installation of critical system services. We systematically analyzed the source code of PMS using a program verification tool and confirmed the presence of those security flaws on all Android official versions and over 3, 000 customized versions. Our research also identified hundreds of exploit opportunities the adversary can leverage over thousands of devices across different device manufacturers, carriers and countries. To mitigate this threat without endangering user data and apps during an upgrade, we also developed a new detection service, called SecUP, which deploys a scanner on the user’s device to capture the malicious apps designed to exploit Pileup vulnerabilities, based upon the vulnerability-related information automatically collected from newly released Android OS images...|$|R
40|$|The use of personal, {{sensitive}} information, such as <b>privileges</b> and <b>attributes,</b> to {{gain access}} to computer resources in distributed environments raises an interesting paradox. On one hand, {{in order to make the}} services and resources accessible to legitimate users, access control infrastructure requires valid and provable service clients' identities or attributes to make decisions. On the other hand, the service clients may not be prepared to disclose their identity information or attributes to a remote party without determining in advance whether the service provider can be trusted with such sensitive information. Moreover, when clients give out personal information, they still are unsure of the extent of propagation and use of the information. This thesis describes an investigation of privacy preserving options in access control infrastructures, and proposes a security model to support the management of those options, based on extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) and Security Access Markup Language (SAML), both of which are OASIS security standards. Existing access control systems are typically unilateral in that the enterprise service provider assigns the access rights and makes the access control decisions, and there is no negotiation between the client and the service provider. As access control management systems lean towards being user-centric or federated, unilateral approaches can no longer adequately preserve the client's privacy, particularly where communicating parties have no pre-existing trust relationship. As a result, a unified approach that significantly improves privacy and confidentiality protection in distributed environments was considered. This resulted in the development of XACML Trust Management Authorization Infrastructure (XTMAI) designed to handle privacy and confidentiality mutually and simultaneously using the concept of Obligation of Trust (OoT) protocol. The OoT enables two or more transaction parties to exchange Notice of Obligations (NoB) (obligating constraints) as well as Signed Acceptance of Obligation (SAO), a proof of acceptance, as security assurances before exchange of sensitive resources.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{for over a century}} that the eye is endowed with remarkable properties that permit the long-term survival of foreign tumor and tissue grafts that are normally rejected at extraocular sites. This ocular immune <b>privilege</b> was originally <b>attributed</b> to a putative sequestration of antigens in the eye {{as a result of the}} conspicuous absence of intraocular lymphatic drainage channels. In the last 30 years, a sizeable body of information indicates that ocular immune privilege is a product of multiple anatomical, physiological, and immunoregulatory processes. Ocular tissues and fluids express a wide variety of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive molecules, including CD 95 L (FasL), transforming growth factor-β, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone, calcitonin gene–related peptide, somatostatin, and complement regulatory proteins. Moreover, antigens entering the anterior chamber of the eye evoke a unique form of immune deviation that culminates in the antigen-specific suppression of TH 1 immune responses. Finally, the intraocular milieu contains both cell membrane and soluble factors that inhibit both the adaptive and innate immune systems. The hair follicle is also recognized for its immune privilege. Like the anterior chamber of the eye, it produces anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-β and adrenocorticotrophic hormone. The cells of the hair follicle display limited expression of class Ia MHC molecules and, like cells that line the anterior chamber of the eye, are protected against CD 8 +cytotoxic T lymphocyte attack. Gaining a better understanding of the immune privilege of the hair follicle may provide insights into the regulation and pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases of the skin...|$|R
