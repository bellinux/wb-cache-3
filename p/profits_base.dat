40|$|Abstract — As {{electricity}} markets undergo deregulation {{all over the}} world, the approach to the unit commitment problem (UCP) changes significantly. The independent system operator (ISO) relies on bid prices from the various generation companies (GENCOs) to make commitment decisions – {{a situation that is}} significantly different from the traditional regulated environment. Each GENCO sets up their own independent unit commitment strategies with the aim of maximizing <b>profit</b> <b>based</b> on the cost characteristics of their generators and revenues from predicted prices of energy and reserve in {{what is known as the}} <b>Profit</b> <b>Based</b> Unit Commitment (PBUC). This paper reviews the state of the art in the solution of the PBUC problem in deregulated environments.

40|$|Abstract — In the {{deregulated}} electricity market, each generating {{company has}} to maximize its own profit by committing suitable generation schedule termed as <b>profit</b> <b>based</b> unit commitment (PBUC). This article proposes a Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PPSO) {{solution to the}} PBUC problem. This method has better convergence characteristics in obtaining optimum solution. The proposed approach uses a cluster of computers performing parallel operations in a distributed environment for obtaining the PBUC solution. The time complexity and the solution quality {{with respect to the}} number of processors in the cluster are thoroughly tested. The method has been applied to 10 unit system and the results show that the proposed PPSO in a distributed cluster constantly outperforms the other methods which are available in the literature.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for Real-Time Application of <b>Profit</b> <b>Based</b> Unit Commitment using Memory Management Algorithm. The main objective of the restructured system is to maximize its own profit without the responsibility of satisfying the forecasted demand. The <b>Profit</b> <b>Based</b> Unit Commitment (PBUC) is solved by Memory Management Algorithm (MMA) in Real-Time Application. MMA approach is introduced in this paper considering power and reserve generation. The proposed method MMA uses Best Fit and Worst Fit allocation for generator scheduling {{in order to receive}} the maximum profit by considering the softer demand. Also, this method gives an idea regarding how much power and reserve should be sold in markets. The proposed approach has been tested on a power system with 2, 3, and 10 generating units. Simulation results of the proposed approach have been compared with the existing methods...|$|R

40|$|The {{fight against}} cartels is a {{priority}} for antitrust authorities {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. What differs between the EU and the US is not the basic toolkit for achieving deterrence, but to whom it is targeted. In the EU, pecuniary sanctions against the firm are the only instruments available to the Commission, while in the US criminal sanctions are also widely employed. The aim of this paper is to compare two diferent types of fines levied on managerial firms when they collude. We consider a <b>profit</b> <b>based</b> fine as opposed to a delegation based fine, with the latter targeting the manager in a more direct way. Under the assumption of revenue equivalence, we find that the delegation based fine, although distortive, is more effective in deterring cartels than the <b>profit</b> <b>based</b> one. When evaluating social welfare, a trade-off between deterrence and output distortion can arise. However, if the antitrust authority focuses on consumer surplus, then the delegation based fine is to be preferred...|$|R

40|$|The {{deregulation}} of the electric power market introduced a strong element of competition. Power plant operators strive to develop advanced operational strategies to maximize the profitability in the dynamic electric power market. New methodologies for gas turbine power plant operational modeling and optimization are needed for power plant operation to enhance operational decision making, and therefore to maximize power plant profitability by reducing operations and maintenance cost and increasing revenue. In this study, a <b>profit</b> <b>based,</b> lifecycle oriented, and unit specific methodology for gas turbine based power plant operational modeling was developed, with the power plant performance, reliability, maintenance, and market dynamics considered simultaneously. The generic methodology is applicable {{for a variety of}} optimization problems, and several applications for operational optimization were implemented using this method. A multiple time-scale method was developed for gas turbine power plants long term generation scheduling. This multiple time-scale approach allows combining the detailed granularity of the day-to-day operations with global (seasonal) trends, while keeping the resulting optimization model relatively compact. Using the multiple timescale optimization method, a <b>profit</b> <b>based</b> outage departure planning method was developed, and the key factors for this <b>profit</b> <b>based</b> approach include power plant aging, performance degradation, reliability deterioration, and the energy market dynamics. A novel approach for gas turbine based power plant sequential preventive maintenance scheduling was also introduced. Finally, methods to evaluate the impact of upgrade packages on gas turbine power plant performance, reliability, and economics were developed, and TIES methodology was applied for effective evaluation and selection of gas turbine power plant upgrade packages.
