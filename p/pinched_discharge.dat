40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that the idea of}} a photon rocket through the {{complete}} annihilation of matter with antimatter, first proposed by Sänger, is not a utopian scheme as it is widely believed. Its feasibility appears to be possible by the radiative collapse of a relativistic high current <b>pinch</b> <b>discharge</b> in a hydrogen-antihydrogen ambiplasma down to a radius determined by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Through this collapse to ultrahigh densities the proton-antiproton pairs {{in the center of the}} pinch can become the upper GeV laser level for the transition into a coherent gamma ray beam by proton-antiproton annihilation, with the magnetic field of the collapsed <b>pinch</b> <b>discharge</b> absorbing the recoil momentum of the beam and transmitting it to the spacecraft.

40|$|In certain plasma {{discharge}} experiments, {{it has been}} observed that under specific conditions a plasma glow discharge column tends to seek the central location of the discharge electrodes away from the electrode edges and chamber walls. Further, the column appears to have the properties of a stabilized equilibrium plasma pinch in a glow (non-arc-like) state. This is unusual since, normally field enhancements occur on edges resulting in arc-like discharge breakdown. Also, the column of plasma that protrudes from the anode emits highly intense, non-uniform light that is uncharacteristically bright for a glow discharge. The main purpose of this thesis is to explore the likely experimental cause and basic physics of this phenomenon. In particular, the glow discharge 2 ̆ 7 s secondary electron beam is explored and the consequences of this moderately energetic beam are examined. It appears that under certain conditions and assumptions, this secondary electron beam will initiate and sustain electron channeling and subsequent pinch forces due to charge repulsion, charge neutralization, and self-magnetic forces. This theory can be expanded beyond a glow discharge and be applied to any moderately energetic beam that passes through plasma, as long as the assumptions and conditions are not violated. An experimental apparatus was also constructed to investigate this phenomenon. It delivers controlled pulses that generate stable and repetitive <b>pinched</b> <b>discharges.</b> It allows the user to change the parameters and the conditions of the discharge and to study the conditions that bring about plasma constriction.

The same code, in disagreement with experiment, gives 560 kA of ECCD for a well documented, completely ECCD-driven, 100 kA TCV shot [O. Sauter et al, PRL, 2000]. Recent work (R. W.

Transport does not substantially affect DIII-D ECCD, but at similar ECH power has an overwhelming effect on the much smaller TCV. The transport is consistent with electrostatic-type diffusion (D{sub {rho}{rho}} constant in velocity-space) and not with a magnetic-type diffusion (D{sub {rho}{rho}} {proportional_to} |v{parallel}|).

The immediate goal has been to identify the requirements for producing a stabilized pinch in Tormac V qualitatively {{similar to that in}} Tormac IV. Concurrently, V has been modified to increase the pinch current and experimental investigation is underway. The experimental procedure is to introduce a toroidal magnetic field into the gas filled chamber. A toroidal electric field is then induced which ionizes the gas; the associated toroidal current simultaneously <b>pinches</b> the <b>discharge.</b> Uncertainty about the details of this process, in particular, about the amount of toroidal flux trapped within the pinch, has led to a one parameter theory. Speculation about the plasma heating mechanism and the subsequent interaction of pinch and cusp is left aside at this time.

40|$|A self stabilized, free standing, z-pinch plasma channel {{has been}} {{proposed}} to deliver the high intensity heavy ion beam {{from the end of}} a driver to the fuel target in a heavy ion inertial fusion power plant. The z-pinch relaxes emittance and energy spread requirements requiring a lower cost driver. A z-pinch transport would reduce the number of beam entry port holes to the target chamber from over a hundred to four as compared to neutralized ballistic focusing thus reducing the driver hardware exposure to neutron flux. Experiments where a double pulse discharge technique is used, z-pinch plasma channels with enhanced stability are achieved. Typical parameters are 7 kV pre-pulse discharge and 30 kV main bank discharge with 50 kA of channel current in a 7 torr background gas atmosphere. This work is an experimental study of these plasma channels examining the relevant physics necessary to understand and model such plasmas. Laser diagnostics measured the dynamical properties of neutrals and plasma. Schlieren and phase contrast techniques probe the pre-pulse gas dynamics and infrared interferometry and faraday effect polarimetry are used on the z-pinch to study its electron density and current distribution. Stability and repeatability of the z-pinch depend on the initial conditions set by the pre-pulse. Results show that the z-pinch channel is wall stabilized by an on-axis gas density depression created by the pre-pulse through hydrodynamic expansion where the ratio of the initial gas density to the final gas density is > 10 / 1. The low on-axis density favors avalanching along the desired path for the main bank <b>discharge.</b> <b>Pinch</b> time is around 2 s from the main bank discharge initiation with a FWHM of {approx} 2 cm. Results also show that typical main bank discharge plasma densities reach 10 {sup 17 } cm{sup - 3 } peak on axis for a 30 kV, 7 torr gas nitrogen discharge. Current rise time is limited by the circuit-channel inductance with the highest contribution to the impedance due to the plasma. There is no direct evidence of surface currents due to high frequency skin effects and magnetic field experiments indicate that > 70 % of the current carried by the channel is enclosed within FWHM of the channel.
