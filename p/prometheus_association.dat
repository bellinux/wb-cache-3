5000|$|The <b>Prometheus</b> Camp <b>Association</b> is a {{collaborative}} {{partner of the}} International Humanist and Ethical Youth Organisation (IHEYO).|$|R
5000|$|The first Prometheus {{camp was}} held in 1989 when the {{students}} of a secondary school ethics class developed the idea for {{an alternative to the}} Christian confirmation camps usually attended by 15-year-olds in Finland. The first camp was arranged by Feto ry (Teachers of Philosophy and Ethics) and a year later the <b>Prometheus</b> Camp <b>Association</b> (Protu) was founded. [...] In 2009 the Prometheus camp movement spread to Sweden where a sister organization to Protu, Protus Sverige, was formed. In 2012 The <b>Prometheus</b> Camp <b>Association</b> was one of the largest youth organisations in Finland along with Finnish Scouts and the youth organisation of the National Coalition Party.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Prometheus</b> Camp <b>Association</b> also {{arranges}} special camps {{where the}} program emphasis or location differs from typical Prometheus camps. In 2009, two theater camps, two visual arts camps and a hiking camp were organized. Adult campers are also accommodated, and adult camps (for campers {{past the age}} of 20) are organized every year.|$|R
5000|$|In 1905, started {{operations}} in the <b>Prometheus</b> Society (Student <b>Association</b> <b>Prometheus),</b> the aim {{of which was the}} implementation of freedom of thought. The association activities (1905-14) were among the participants Edvard Westermarck, Rafael Karsten, Rolf Lager Borg, Knut Tall, Wilhel Bolin, Yrjö Hirn, Georg Schauman, Hjalmar Magnus Eklund, Harry Federley, Söderhjelm, Gunnar Castrén, KH Wiik, Viktor Heikel and Ernst Lampén. The association called for the removal of confessional religious education in schools and the adoption of civil marriage [...] Westermarck was also a British free - thinker member of the organization. [...] tense social situation in the mid-1910s contributed to the deterioration club activities. The civil marriage was made legal in Finland in 1917, by a separate act.|$|R

5000|$|The {{banishment}} of {{the warring}} Titans by the Olympians to the chthonic depths of Tartarus was documented {{as early as}} Homer's Iliad and the Odyssey where they are also identified as the hypotartarioi, or, the [...] "subterranean." [...] The passages appear in the Iliad (XIV 279) {{and also in the}} Homeric hymn to Apollo (335). The particular forms of violence associated especially with the Titans are those of hybristes and atasthalie as further found in the Iliad (XIII 633-34). They are used by Homer to designate an unlimited, violent insolence among the warring Titans which only Zeus was able to ultimately overcome. This text finds direct parallel in Hesiod's reading in the Theogony (209) and in Homer's own Odyssey (XIX 406). In the words of Kerenyi, [...] "Autolykos, the grandfather, is introduced in order that he may give his grandson the name of Odysseus." [...] In a similar fashion, the origin of the naming of the Titans as a group has been disputed with some voicing a preference for reading it as a combination of titainein (to exert), and, titis (retribution) usually rendered as [...] "retribution meted out to the exertion of the Titans." [...] It should be noted in studying material concerning Prometheus that Prometheus was not directly among the Titans warring with Zeus though <b>Prometheus's</b> <b>association</b> with them by lineage is a recurrent theme in each of his subsequent confrontations with Zeus and with the Olympian gods.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 9740 {{young people}} {{attended}} Prometheus camps in Finland between 1989 and 2008. In 2008, 67 camps were organized {{in different parts}} of Finland, and about 1000 young people (1.5% of that age-group) attended those camps. The attendance was fairly steady for a number of years. In 2012 there were 69 camps with about 900 participants. In 2010 the <b>Prometheus</b> Camp <b>Association</b> organised a total of 67 Prometheus camps and had a budget of EUR 464,553. State grants accounted for EUR 82,000 of the budget. Direct expenses from the camps totalled EUR 178,599, and counsellor training cost EUR 76,013. A distinct feature of the camps is that the staff do their work as volunteers.|$|R
5000|$|In Finland non-religious lower {{high school}} {{students}} planned a camp for a secular rite of passage {{as an alternative to}} the Christian Confirmation, and the first Prometheus-leiri (Prometheus Camp) was held in 1989 by the Finnish Philosophy and Life Stance teachers' coalition. The following year Prometheus-leirin tuki ry (<b>Prometheus</b> Camp <b>Association)</b> was founded for organising the week-long summer camps. The ideology of the association is based on a Humanist world view, but it is politically and religiously non-aligned. One of the main principles of the activity is tolerance towards other peoples' life stances.The camp is primarily aimed at youngsters who do not belong to any religious denomination, but approximately 20% of yearly Prometheus Camp participants are members of some religious community, usually the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, and also participate in a Christian Confirmation. The usual age of participants in a Prometheus Camp is 14-15 years, but there are also [...] "senior camps" [...] for older youngsters. In recent years the yearly number of participants has been around 900, which is approximately 1,5% of the age group.|$|R

40|$|Forest {{fires in}} the Alps can have severe impacts on {{mountain}} forests reducing their protection capacity against rock falls and avalanches and increasing flood runoff, mud and debris flows (Moody and Martin 2001, Robichaud et al. 2007). Due to climate change, several {{studies have shown that}} the impact of forest {{fires in the}} Alpine environment will increase in the coming decades (Elkin et al. 2013, Lorz et al. 2010, Wastl et al. 2012). A key issue in modern forest fire management is the accurate mapping of forest fuels in order to determine spatial fire hazard, plan mitigation efforts, and active fire management (Krasnow et al. 2009). Several surface fuel description systems are currently used by land management agencies in the USA, Europe, Canada and Australia, and most of these systems have the same categories, components and description variables (Sandberg et al. 2001, Scott and Burgan 2005). A generalized description of fuels based upon average fuel properties is called a “fuel model”. A fuel model is a set of fuelbed inputs (e. g. load, bulk density, fuel particle size, heat content and moisture of extinction) used by a specific software for predicting the fire behaviour (e. g. FARSITE). Standard fuel models were developed in the USA by Anderson (1982) and more recently by Scott and Burgan (2005). Standard fuel models that fit the main local vegetation characteristics can be used as input for fire spread modelling and in combination with custom fuel models when available (Duguy et al. 2007, Arca et al. 2009, Jahdi et al. 2015). However, the Standard or custom fuel models have seldom been applied in the Alps. In this study we tested the possibility of defining some custom fuel models for the Eastern Italian Alps, which might allow a more reliable fire behaviour prediction when fire simulator systems are used. The custom fuel models definition was done by means of three steps: In the first step we studied local fire regime and fire behaviour and we tested the hypothesis that the decrease in burned area is related to an improvement in fire-fighting efficiency since the beginning of the 3 rd millennium. In the second step fuel properties were measured in the field and analyzed. In the third step we made three fuel model sets based on three different approaches (Forest type <b>association,</b> <b>Prometheus</b> classification, Cluster classification). Then, using FARSITE (Finney 2004), we simulated ten fires that occurred in the Veneto Region from 2003 to 2013. Every fire was simulated using the three custom model sets and the Standard fuel models (Anderson 1982, Scott and Burgan 2005). Lastly, the fuel model set having the higher accuracy was adjusted in order to improve its performance in simulating real fire behaviour. In the Veneto Region, there was a decreasing number of fires per year from 1981 to 2004 and a much more evident decrease in the annual burned area. Fires in both mountain areas and the lowlands usually behave as surface fires and the burned area is seldom larger than ten hectares. We tested the hypothesis that the decrease in burned area is related to an improvement in fire-fighting efficiency since the beginning of the 3 rd millennium. The power-law distribution of burned areas seems to confirm that suppression efficiency has been improved because the exponent of the power-law distribution was much higher in the last decade than in the previous two. In mountain areas fuel load paralleled what is reported in the literature for similar forests, but in the lowlands fuel load appeared much higher, probably because those forests are affected by phytosanitary problems that cause a higher amount of deadwood. We found significant differences in fuel load among vegetation types (chestnut, hop hornbeam forests, conifer plantations and shrubland), The most significant difference was litter load (p< 0. 001 in the lowlands; p= 0. 0015 in mountain areas). Significant differences were also found between forest managements (coppiced, high forest, unmanaged). Mainly shrubs load (p< 0. 0018 in the lowlands) and herbs (p= 0. 0029 in mountain areas). The fuel distribution in size classes was never normal but, as commonly reported in the literature, it followed a logarithmic or a power-law trend. The tests on fire behaviour fuel models showed that Prometheus and Cluster fuel model sets led to inaccurate fire behaviour predictions. Standard fuel models (Anderson 1982, Scott and Burgan 2005) generally performed well and Forest type fuel models were the best in predicting fire behaviour, despite a frequent underestimation of flame height and rate of spread. By using a calibration process, we modified the Forest type fuel models and improved the performance in FARSITE. The resulting Calibrated fuel models could be suggested for further fire behaviour applications in the Eastern Italian Alps. ...|$|R
