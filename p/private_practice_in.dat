5|$|The asylum was {{established}} by Edward Long Fox and considered {{state of the art}} when it opened in 1806, having been built on moral treatment ideas pioneered at the York Retreat, which had opened in 1796.

5|$|In 1763 coal was {{discovered}} in Radstock and mining began in the area, however transport was a major problem because of the poor state of the roads. This cost {{and the potential for}} cheaper delivery of coal from south Wales via the Monmouthshire Canal led to the proposal for a canal which could transport the coal to Bath and Wiltshire. Initial surveys were conducted during 1793 by William Jessop and William Smith under the direction of John Rennie who presented the report on 14 October 1793 estimating the cost of construction of the canal at £80,000. Smith, who also worked at the Mearns Pit at High Littleton, made the original observations leading to his important stratification theory by observing the dips in the geological strata through which the canal was cut. Smith became Surveyor to the company, but was dismissed in April 1799, apparently because he had used his position as surveyor to buy a local house at advantageous terms. He then set himself up in a <b>private</b> <b>practice</b> <b>in</b> Bath but was re-engaged by the company in 1811, to provide advice when repairs became necessary to the canal bed.|$|E
