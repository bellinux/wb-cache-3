50|$|The long {{wheelbase}} {{meant that the}} facing <b>point</b> <b>locking</b> bars on the line had to be lengthened. It went into service in April or May 1907, and the rail motor gradually took {{up the majority of}} the passenger traffic, and by July 1907 was working the ordinary passenger trains four days per week, at a daily saving of £3 6s 6d.|$|E
50|$|The {{program was}} written in Delphi 6, a dialect of Object Pascal, by Geoff Mayo {{and has been in}} {{development}} since the late 1990s. Visually, it resembles the British Rail Integrated Electronic Control Centre (IECC), though most of the simulations do not cover areas operated by IECC-based signal boxes. It simulates overlaps, approach locking, time-of-operation <b>point</b> <b>locking,</b> shunt routes, warner routes, call-on routes, and more.|$|E
50|$|Six years later, Shuman began robbing {{banks in}} Canada, 12 in York Region, Ontario (Markham, Richmond Hill and Vaughan), four in Calgary, Alberta, {{two in the}} Region of Peel, Ontario, and one in each of Hamilton, Ottawa and Toronto between 2010 and 2015 - 21 robberies in Canada. Shuman became more violent as the robberies progressed, waiting for {{employees}} to open the banks {{in the morning and}} holding them at gun <b>point</b> <b>locking</b> them in the vault. He managed to steal a total of about $450,000 from the robberies, most of which were successful.|$|E

50|$|In 1907 the Caledonian Railway Working Timetable (WTT) {{shows that}} the 12.10pm goods from Gushetfaulds to Ardrossan via Cathcart worked Gree siding. The May 1915 'appendix' to the WTT states that - The Siding must only be worked during {{daylight}} and not during a Fog or Snowstorm. The <b>Points</b> <b>Locking</b> Frame is secured by a padlock. The Key of the Box in which the <b>Points</b> <b>Locking</b> Frame is placed, is {{in the custody of}} the Signalman at Lugton Station.|$|R
50|$|Variations on a treadle {{that can}} be {{carriage}} long include facing <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> bars, clearance bars, and train bars, depending how they are located on a track layout.|$|R
50|$|In 1907 {{the section}} was singled {{when the second}} platform, waiting-room, {{footbridge}} and signal box were all removed. Entrance lines to the siding are provided for each direction from the single line, with facing <b>point</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A facing <b>point</b> <b>lock,</b> FPL or <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> is {{a device}} which, {{as the name}} implies, locks a set of points in position, as well as proving {{that they are in}} the correct position. The [...] "facing point" [...] part of the name refers {{to the fact that they}} are to prevent {{movement}} of the points during facing moves, where a train could potentially split the points (end up going down both tracks) if the points were to move underneath the train - during trailing moves, the wheels of a train will force the points into the correct position if they attempt to move.|$|R
30|$|When {{the points}} {{are in their}} desired position, they are <b>locked.</b> The term <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> means that the points in a route {{will not be able}} to change their {{positions}} when a train is traversing over it.|$|R
50|$|Since the accident, a new {{signal box}} has been opened at Ropley, with full interlocking, which will prevent {{a repeat of}} this incident. Also, fouling bars have been {{installed}} to prevent points being moved (when the Facing <b>Point</b> <b>Lock</b> is not in use).|$|R

50|$|However the {{inspection}} by Col F M Rich of the Board of Trade was disappointing; this {{was necessary to}} permit passenger operation, but permission was refused. A number of signalling alterations were required, chiefly facing <b>point</b> <b>locks</b> and signal repeaters; in addition the Company had no passenger rolling stock yet.|$|R
50|$|By the {{movement}} of individual levers, signals, points, level crossing gates or barriers and sometimes movable bridges over waterways are operated via wires and rods. The signaller chooses the correct combination of <b>points,</b> facing <b>point</b> <b>locks</b> and signals to operate, which will control {{the movement}} of each train through his or her area of control.|$|R
50|$|In Autumn 2010 {{changes were}} made to allow Cambrian and Welsh Marches line trains to depart in a southerly {{direction}} from Platform 3. An upper quadrant signal replaced the previous shunting disc and a facing <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> {{was added to the}} points. Though the track layout could already accommodate this, until the lock was added only non-passenger movements southbound from Platform 3 could be made.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, FPLs {{were common}} {{from an early}} date, due to laws being passed which forced the {{provision}} of FPLs for any routes travelled by passenger trains - it was, and still is, illegal for a passenger train to make a facing move over points without them being locked, either by a <b>point</b> <b>lock,</b> or temporarily clamped in one position or another.|$|R
2500|$|Skill Shot: [...] When {{initially}} {{launching the}} ball, dropping it into Thing's scoop {{just past the}} launch ramp gives 2 million points the first time, increasing by a million each time up {{to a maximum of}} 5 million points each time. [...] Hitting a skill shot may also gain other benefits if they are active on Thing's scoop (e.g. extra ball, Quick Multiball, Thing <b>points,</b> <b>locking</b> a ball for multiball).|$|R
50|$|As of 2010 Glazebrook East Junction {{is still}} intact and remains {{part of the}} {{national}} network.

50|$|North Thoresby {{signal box}} is a 7 lever Eastern region ground frame {{that has been}} {{installed}} to operate the track and signalling layout at North Thoresby. It operates two main line signals, two shunting signal for access {{to and from the}} siding, a facing <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> and a facing point for access {{in and out of the}} siding. With No.1 lever being released by the annetts key making up the final lever in the frame. North Thoresby signal box was commissioned on 7 August 2009.|$|R
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the two request halts (Country Park and Northwood), all intermediate stations have the ability to pass trains on the single line. However, Highley's passing loop lacks a platform and Facing <b>Point</b> <b>Locks</b> on <b>points</b> to attached sidings, a legal requirement for passenger-carrying line, meaning trains carrying fare-paying passengers may not use this loop. However, it is frequently used for works trains, demonstration goods trains and empty stock workings. Despite this, the Severn Valley Railway offers, possibly, the most intensive service on any single line heritage railway.|$|R
50|$|As late as July 1869… the Neath and Brecon Engineer, {{admitted}} to a House of Lords select committee that if any passengers for east of Brecon arrived by train at Mount Street their tickets were collected, they were put on the engine, and run forward on the high level line to a point opposite and above the Watton station. (There was also a loop line direct from the Free Street extension into Watton Yard, but the Neath & Brecon witnesses claimed that the B&M would not let them use it, but kept the <b>points</b> <b>locked.</b>|$|R

At the time of transit, she was drafting 11.5 ft at her bow and at nearly 15 ft at her stern, while some portions of the Arkansas River were less than 9 ft deep. A pair of barges were used as pontoons to lift the submarine a few feet to clear the river bottom while remaining low enough to pass under the bridges along her route, just as [...] had 32 years earlier.|$|R

50|$|Coopworth sheep are a medium-sized, dual purpose, longwool breed, with {{an alert}} but quiet disposition.

The body is long with a good loin and hindquarter, light forequarter and a wide pelvis. The fleece, with <b>pointed</b> <b>locks,</b> has a well-defined crimp with bright luster and spinning count of 44-48 (35-39 micrometres) and a staple length of 6-8 inches. While only white Coopworths may be registered in New Zealand and Australia, both white and natural colored Coopworths are accepted for registration in the United States and Canada.|$|R
50|$|The points {{failure was}} caused by the {{extremely}} cold weather that day freezing the point mechanisms. When the signalman had accepted the fish train from the previous signalbox to the North, he needed to swing the facing points (that allowed entry into the Up Platform Loop from the Up line) from reverse to normal. When he pushed the lever back into the frame he was able to engage the <b>point</b> <b>lock</b> and thus clear the signal. Unbeknown to him, the point rods had actually bent due to the mechanisms freezing up, which allowed him to place the point lever in the normal position, but actually left the points in reverse. This accident is one of the very rare occasions where mechanical interlocking has failed to work correctly.|$|R
