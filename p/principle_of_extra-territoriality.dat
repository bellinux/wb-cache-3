40|$|Shanghai and Hong Kong {{are very}} much like blood sisters. Shanghai is called the Lustrous Pearl of the Orient; Hong Kong, the Pearl of the East. Like two stars on the China coast, the two cities {{have a lot in}} common, in terms of geography, history, and challenges. Strategically placed {{at the mouth of the}} Yangtze River and Pearl River estuaries, both cities command the {{physical}} and social capital of rich hinterlands. They also bear witness to the turbulent history of China as their destiny is linked to western forays into Qing China on her knees. The momentous stroke that rewrote their history is of course the Opium War and the Treaty of Nanking (1842). Foremost among the humiliations were territorial concessions. Hong Kong was ceded to Britain as a colony, a status that was to last until 1997. The same treaty also turned Shanghai into a treaty port and semicolony, when the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>extra-territoriality</b> took the physical form of the international settlements. However infamous the past may be, the insulation from the most vicious wars and turmoil that besieged the China heartland was the key to Shanghai and Hong Kong's success. In the process, the twins evolved into the great hubs of trade and industry unmatched by any other Chinese city. Of equal importance has been the absorption of hundreds of thousands of immigrants, among them entrepreneurs, intellectuals, revolutionaries, artisans, and ordinary people. The mixing of the most adventurous and enterprising elements from within China and from all over the world underlaid the fantastic blending of cultures and practices. This not only turned them into great metropolises, but it also gave a big push to China's modernization. At the same time, unbridled growth in the context of cultural bastardy sired many social problemsâdrugs, crime, prostitution, poverty, and exploitationâthat bestowed both with an aura of exotic decadence. ...|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I argue that, {{since the}} 1980 s, French airports {{have been designed}} to exclude people from legal, human and refugee rights. The particular space where this happens has been successively called “international zone”, “transit zone” and “waiting zone” and its scope has been significantly extended overtime. I contend that French authorities have used the concept <b>of</b> <b>extra-territoriality</b> in concert with the material design of the airport to sustain exclusion. While this research focuses on France, findings bear relevance to the global governance of migrants and refugees. The French case epitomizes how states creatively use the law (or absence thereof) and geography to keep undesirable non-citizens, including asylum claimants, away from their territories. In the 1980 s and early 1990 s, the government established Paris airports’ international zones as non-French, extra-territorial spaces to circumvent domestic and international laws. I use the term “extra-territoriality” with a hyphen to refer to this deliberate excision of territory. When the Law on the Waiting Zone came into existence in 1992, exclusion was reinvented through another form <b>of</b> <b>extra-territoriality,</b> premised on the non-citizen’s legal status at the border. Since then, the term “waiting zone” has assigned both legal and geographical dimensions to this place. This research topic matters as this law established a parallel, less protective legal framework for foreign nationals arriving at the border compared to the one applicable to their counterparts already deemed on French soil - who are either applying for asylum or are to be removed after being caught for staying illegally in the country -. Yet France is a liberal democracy bound by obligations under human rights and refugee conventions at the regional and international levels. Is a less protective system of rights based on the distinction between physical and legal entry necessary? I was drawn to the waiting zone for my research because it is an understudied area; the waiting zone is physically difficult to access, yet important to understand. I chose to focus on Paris Roissy-Charles de Gaulle (CDG) airport’s waiting zone, which detains the greatest number of individuals in France. I sought to answer several research questions. First, how did the Law on the Waiting Zone come to existence? Second, does the Law on the Waiting Zone constitute a break from the initial phase <b>of</b> <b>extra-territoriality?</b> In other words, is the term “extra-territoriality” inappropriate to describe the current situation of non-citizens placed under the waiting zone regime? Third, how do actors working in and on the waiting zone perceive this legal regime and their role therein? Finally, how are foreign nationals being treated in CDG airport’s waiting zone? Do they have access to rights, or do they face barriers? Different research methods were used to answer these questions. I engaged in discourse analysis of a variety of sources and carried out 35 semi-structured expert interviews. Participants were asked to answer questions regarding their perception of the legal framework applying to the border zone, their role and actions therein. Finally, I used the participant observation method at CDG airport...|$|R
60|$|In {{regard to}} mines, {{development}} by the Chinese themselves is urgent, since undeveloped resources tempt the greed of the Great Powers, and development by foreigners {{makes it possible}} to keep China enslaved. It should therefore be enacted that, in future, no sale of mines or of any interest in mines to foreigners, and no loan from foreigners on the security of mines, will be recognized as legally valid. In view <b>of</b> <b>extra-territoriality,</b> {{it will be difficult to}} induce foreigners to accept such legislation, and Consular Courts will not readily admit its validity. But, as the example <b>of</b> <b>extra-territoriality</b> in Japan shows, such matters depend upon the national strength; if the Powers fear China, they will recognize the validity of Chinese legislation, but if not, not. In view of the need of rapid development of mining by Chinese, it would probably be unwise to nationalize all mines here and now. It would be better to provide every possible encouragement to genuinely Chinese private enterprise, and to offer the assistance of geological and mining experts, etc. The Government should, however, retain the right (a) to buy out any mining concern at a fair valuation; (b) to work minerals itself in cases where the private owners fail to do so, in spite of expert opinion in favour of their being worked. These powers should be widely exercised, and as soon as mining has reached the point compatible with national security, the mines should be all nationalized, except where, as at Tayeh, diplomatic agreements stand in the way. It is clear that the Tayeh mines must be recovered by China as soon as opportunity offers, but when or how that will be it is as yet impossible to say. Of course I have been assuming an orderly government established in China, but without that nothing vigorous can be done to repel foreign aggression. This is a point to which, along with other general questions connected with the industrializing of China, I shall return in my last chapter.|$|R
40|$|The geopolitical {{significance}} of Pakistan in the Global War on Terror {{has led to}} multiple instances of the US acting in an extra-territorial manner. Repeated territorial intrusion by the US strains US-Pakistan relations because extra-territoriality {{is viewed as a}} violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty. This study analyzes Pakistani-English political cartoons to examine the ways the US extra-territoriality is represented. Approximately 2940 political cartoons are collected from four Pakistani-English newspapers: Dawn, The Express Tribune, The Nation, and The News. Wallerstein’s world-system theory provides the theoretical backdrop to demonstrate the explicit (military) and implicit (economic, cultural, and political/diplomatic) means a hegemonic-core power can act extra-territorially towards a state in the periphery. A combination of content analysis and social semiotic analysis methodologies is used. Content analysis reveals a total of 323 US-related political cartoons that are classified into themes of economic, cultural, military, and political/diplomatic depictions in political cartoons. A visual social semiotic analysis deconstructs the visual rhetoric <b>of</b> <b>extra-territoriality</b> as expressed in the various themed political cartoons. The outcome of these two methodologies provides a holistic illustration of the ways US extra-territoriality in a sovereign but periphery state like Pakistan is viewed...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} sources of {{law has been}} a matter of {{considerable}} attention not only in legal theory and philosophy but also in positive law disciplines. Sources of law are commonly divided into substantive, formal and value-based sources. Depending on classifications suggested by different authors, general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> law may fall into all three categories of sources <b>of</b> law. General <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> domestic law are rules covering a vast number of specific situations which are subsequently used as grounds for generating numerous norms regulating these situations in more detail. In international law, there are general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> international law as well as legal principles recognized by civilized nations. General <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the European Union law {{are an integral part of}} the positive EU legislation, which clearly differentiates them from similar sets of general goals, objectives, values, agenda postulates, and the like.

Considering their content and legal nature, the general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are divided into: compulsory or axiomatic principles, regulatory or structural principles (which all national laws of the Member States have in common), and the general principles inherent to the EU legal order. Some of the most important general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> EU law are: the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> supremacy of EU law over the national law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> direct effect of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> autonomy of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> full effect of EU law, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> State liability for damage, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> legality, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> legal certainty, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> good faith and fair dealing, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> fair hearing, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> subsidiarity, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> proportionality, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> loyalty, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> non-discrimination, etc...|$|R
