50|$|Kalkitoxin {{has five}} chiral centers, {{one of which}} is the ring carbon to which the {{terminal}} alkene is coordinated, with the remaining four occurring at tertiary carbon atoms along the aliphatic chain originating from the imine nitrogen. The total stereochemistry of natural (+)-kalkitoxin is 3R,7R,8S,10S,2′R. For this determination, 3JCH values by a variation of the HSQMBC <b>pulse</b> <b>technique,</b> a type of HMBC spectroscopy, and 3JHH values by exclusive correlation spectroscopy (E.COSY). These methods use NMR to evaluate the spin-spin coupling constants which directly relate to the dihedral angle of the atoms being analyzed, allowing for the determination of chirality. This was used to determine the stereochemistry of chiral centers at C7, C8, and C10. Because C7 and C8 are adjacent stereocenters, these techniques allowed for immediate determination of their relative stereochemistry, however C10 is separated from C8 by C9, which carries two diastereotopic protons. This allows for the determination of relative stereochemistry of C8 and C10 to the C9 protons through J-coupling \3J coupling values, so as to relate the relative stereochemistry of C8 to C10. These methods yielded a relative stereochemistry of 7R, 8S, 10S for the aliphatic chain stereocenters. Stereochemistry at C3 was determined by Marfey's analysis, wherein the compound was ozonized and subsequently hydrolyzed to obtain cysteic acid from the thiazoline ring and attached terminal alkene. Marfey's analysis indicated this amino acid derivative was L-cysteic acid, indicating R absolute stereochemistry at C3. The absolute stereochemistry of the total molecule was determined by synthesizing the possible configurations of the already determined relative chiralities, and comparison of these to natural Kalkitoxin via 13C NMR shift differences, revealing the natural (+)-kalkitoxin stereochemistry to be 3R,7R,8S,10S,2′R.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSixteen out-of-hospital {{survivors}} of ventricular fibrillation underwent a prospective, randomized, intraoperative comparison of sequential pulse and single pulse defibrillation {{with use of}} two distinct electrode systems and waveform shapes currently available for clinical use. Defibrillation was tested alternately with either the single pulse or the sequential pulse system 10 s into an episode of ventricular fibrillation. Sequential pulse defibrillation was performed with two 4 ms truncated exponential pulses of constant duration delivered to three equally spaced oval epicardial patch electrodes composed of concentric coils. The posterior left ventricular electrode served as the common cathode. The first anode was over the anterior right ventricle and the second anode was over the anterior left ventricle. Single pulse defibrillation was performed with the standard intracardiac defibrillation system with use of a single truncated exponential pulse with a fixed 65 % tilt delivered across two rectangular, wire mesh epicardial patch electrodes positioned over the anterior right ventricle and posterolateral left ventricle. During defibrillation threshold determination, voltage and current waveforms were recorded and used to determine pulsing resistance and delivered and stored energy. Average defibrillation threshold leading edge voltage for the single <b>pulse</b> <b>technique</b> was 273 ± 101 V compared with 246 ± 67 V (11 % less) for the sequential <b>pulse</b> <b>technique</b> (p = 0. 136). Defibrillation threshold leading edge current for the single <b>pulse</b> <b>technique</b> was 6. 7 ± 2. 5 A compared with 5. 2 ± 1. 7 A (29 % less) for the sequential pulse method (p = 0. 005). The defibrillation threshold delivered energy was 5. 6 ± 4. 0 J for the single <b>pulse</b> <b>technique</b> and 3. 5 ± 1. 8 J (38 % less) for the sequential <b>pulse</b> <b>technique</b> (p = 0. 021).

40|$|Conventional and microwave-heated oxygen <b>pulsing</b> <b>techniques</b> on metal-doped {{activated}} carbons {{to achieve}} a controlled meso/micropore structure were investigated. The gas pulsing experiments consisted of repeated cycles. Each cycle consists of an oxidising stage, under O 2 /Ar atmosphere and constant temperature, and a burn-off stage, under N 2 atmosphere at variable temperature (heating and cooling). The porosity of the carbons was analysed by nitrogen adsorption at − 196 °C. Two different activated carbons, Cu-doped BPL (BPL-Cu) and ASC, were used as raw materials. The commercial activated carbon ASC showed higher reactivity towards O 2, due to the catalytic effect of the metals (mainly, Cu and Cr) {{that are on the}} carbon surface and their better dispersion. After several pulses, ASC underwent a moderate increase in the micropore volume and a significant increase in mesopore volume. BPL-Cu showed a higher increase in microporosity than mesoporosity, giving rise to a meso/micropore volume ratio lower than that of the original BPL-Cu. Oxygen <b>pulsing</b> <b>technique</b> was carried out in a conventional furnace and in a microwave oven. Conventional and microwave-heated oxygen pulsing on ASC yielded similar textural development.
