With its long shoots, the Styrian oilseed pumpkin (cucurbita pepo ssp. pepo var. styriaca) is particularly popular as it does not only create identity but also holds large economic potential considering the countless products made from the vegetable, such as <b>pumpkinseed</b> <b>oil,</b> pasta, jams, soaps and many other items. It {{seems as if the}} vegetable has always been cultivated in this region and has enjoyed at least some degree of esteem. The historical perspective reveals, however, that pumpkins as a culinary trait of Styria's food culture are far from being as old as various marketing policies try to make us believe. The vegetable, which is a native of Central America, arrived in Europe not before the 16 th century. In Styria, it was not accepted as foodstuff for a long time. Similar to potatoes, pumpkins were regarded as pig feed. However, there is evidence that the consumption of <b>pumpkinseed</b> <b>oil</b> dates back to the late 17 th century. In {{the second half of the}} 18 th century, bad harvests and similar disasters led to food shortages and famines. In 1773, under the rule of Joseph II, an information pamphlet was published and widely distributed among the populace. The aim of this 'publicity campaign' was to promote the cultivation and consumption of pumpkins. The pamphlet also contained a number of pumpkin recipes to compensate for the grain scarcity. This paper analyses the effectiveness of these measures by examining references to pumpkin in cookery books of the time. The analysis includes fifteen cookery books from the late 17 th to the mid 19 th century which were printed in the city of Graz. This study illustrates political approaches towards the improvement of the food situation in the late 18 th century, while establishing the extent of acceptance by the populace or parts thereof...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (marker and dioxin-like congeners), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (EPA 15  +  1), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (14 predominant congeners) and pesticides (74 compounds) in various cold-pressed vegetable oils. Poppy seed oil, rapeseed oil, sesame seed oil, <b>pumpkinseed</b> <b>oil,</b> hempseed oil, linaire oil, borage oil and evening star oil were investigated. Results of this study revealed that concentrations of PCBs, PBDEs and PAHs were low in majority of the investigated samples. However, high concentrations of organophosphorus insecticides were found. Chlorpyrifos methyl and pirimiphos methyl were the pesticide residues most commonly found in the studied oils. Concentration of 15  +  1 EPA PAHs was within the 17. 85 – 37. 16  μg kg− 1 range, concentration of (marker) PCBs varied from 127 to 24, 882  pg g− 1, dioxin-like TEQ values were below 0. 1 pg TEQ g− 1. Concentration of PBDEs was below LOQ in most cases...|$|E

40|$|Plant {{oils and}} fats are {{important}} and necessary components of the human nutrition. They are energy source and also contain fatty acids - compounds essential for human health. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate nutritional quality of selected plant oil - olive, rapeseed, pumpkin, flax and sesame; based on fatty acid composition in these oils. Fatty acids (MUFA, PUFA, SFA) were analyzed chromatography using system Agilent 6890 GC, injector multimode, detector FID. The highest content of saturated fatty acids was observed in <b>pumpkinseed</b> <b>oil</b> (19. 07 %), the lowest content was found in rapeseed oil (7. 03 %), with low level of palmitic and stearic acids and high level of behenic acid (0. 32 %) among the evaluated oils. The highest content of linoleic acid was determined in pumpkinseed (46. 40 %) and sesame oil (40. 49 %); in these samples was also found lowest content of α -linolenic acid. These oils have important antioxidant properties and are not subject to oxidation. The richest source of linolenic acid was flaxseed oil which, which is therefore more difficult to preserve and process in food industry. In olive oil was confirmed that belongs to the group of oils with a predominantly monosaturated oleic acid (more than 70 %) and a small amount of polysaturated fatty acid. The most commonly used rapeseed oil belongs to the group of oils with the medium content of linolenic acid (8. 76 %); this oil also showed a high content of linoleic acid (20. 24 %). The group of these essentially fatty acids showed a suitable ratio ∑n 3 /n 6 in the rapessed oil (0. 44). <! [...] [endif] [...] ...|$|E
