5|$|After an {{extensive}} review of vineyard conditions {{in and around}} the existing Champagne region, INAO presented a <b>proposal</b> to revise the region on March 14, 2008. The <b>proposal</b> was prepared by a group of five experts in the subjects of history, geography, geology, phytosociology and agronomy, working from 2005. The <b>proposal</b> means expanding the region to cover vineyards in 357 rather than 319 villages. This is to be achieved by adding vineyards in forty villages while simultaneously removing two villages in the Marne départment that were included in the 1927 regulations, Germaine and Orbais-l'Abbaye.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} in Marysville fell through, ISC courted another site, this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton, WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville <b>proposal</b> the <b>proposal</b> in Bremerton {{was to be}} {{partially}} funded with public money, the money will not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme {{similar to the one}} used to fund Kansas Speedway. Also like the Marysville <b>proposal,</b> the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC's current <b>proposal</b> was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens, but the company has promised to present an improved offer for early 2007.|$|E

5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's <b>proposal</b> to attach wings to the spacecraft. This <b>proposal</b> arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and would have seen a Gemini spacecraft attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, and would have been unable to maneuver in orbit.

Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E

5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be {{biconditional}} proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information that would}} lead to Ps arrest, then {{despite the fact that the}} <b>proposal</b> is biconditional (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for P independent of Qs <b>proposal.</b> Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the <b>proposal).</b> Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain neutral proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral <b>proposal,</b> or an offer and a neutral <b>proposal.</b> In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the <b>proposal</b> or the offer.|$|E

40|$|This {{study visits}} {{the role of}} {{shareholder}} <b>proposals</b> in the governance of public corporations by studying withdrawn shareholder <b>proposals.</b> Among all shareholders, unions {{are the most likely}} to withdraw <b>proposals.</b> Furthermore, firms with a record of poor performance, lower insider ownership and more independent boards are likely to see <b>proposals</b> withdrawn. Since unions often possess a high level of bargaining power, we put emphasis on the behavior of unions. We find that unions resubmit <b>proposals</b> that have gained high shareholder support in the prior year. About fifty percent of those resubmitted <b>proposals</b> are withdrawn prior to the annual shareholder meetings. In addition, almost all of those <b>proposals</b> do not reappear in the following year, implying that the issues underlying those <b>proposals</b> have been settled. This phenomenon indicates that unions submit shareholder <b>proposals</b> strategically. Furthermore, it is more likely for unions to adopt this strategy when the prior voting support is higher, when the insider ownership is lower, and when the ownership is less dispersed. The identified strategy played by unions suggests that unions use shareholder <b>proposals</b> for union workers at the expense of shareholder value. ...|$|R

40|$|Shareholder <b>Proposals</b> Post-Enron: What’s Changed, What’s the Same? In {{the wake}} of WorldCom, Enron, and other {{corporate}} governance disasters, investors have been more actively seeking to influence boards of directors using shareholder <b>proposals</b> under Rule 14 a- 8. In this paper, we examine voting patterns, board reactions and the stock price reaction to these shareholder <b>proposals</b> {{to determine if they}} vary from those found in earlier studies. Our findings show some things have changed, while others have remained the same. We find, contrary to earlier studies, that private individuals and private institutions are the most effective in garnering support from other shareholders for their corporate governance <b>proposals.</b> We see an increased number of <b>proposals</b> receiving majority shareholder support during our sample period, and increased board responsiveness to majority vote <b>proposals</b> with directors implementing more of the actions called for by shareholders. Consistent with earlier research, we find that <b>proposals</b> relating to corporate governance issues receive significantly higher levels of voting support from shareholders than social responsibility <b>proposals.</b> Shareholder <b>proposals</b> continue to target relatively poorly performing companies. Anti-takeover <b>proposals</b> attract the highest levels of shareholder support. Insider ownership is negatively correlated with shareholder support and institutional ownership is positively correlated with higher levels of favorable votes. 3 Finally, we find that the stock market’s reaction to shareholder <b>proposals</b> is generally insignificant. ...|$|R
