The probability of small-width WSP increased with time in both groups, but the probability was larger in the normal-atmosphere group. The microstructure of WSP molecules and polymers showed that the aggregate separation increased with storage time. The degradation of WSP molecules was inhibited by controlled-atmosphere storage.

Both muscles are obliquely striated. The predominant type of bloodworm fiber {{is characterized by a}} prominent transversely oriented sarcoplasmic reticulum with numerous dyads at the surface of each cell. Thick myofilaments are ∼ 3 µ long and overlap along ∼ 60 % of their length in extended fibers and ∼ 80 % in shortened fibers. There is virtually no endomysium and very little intracellular skeleton, and the cells are attached by desmosomes to one another rather than to connective tissue. Dense bodies are absent from the fibers and in their place are Z lines, which are truly linear rather than planar. Scattered among the predominant fibers are others, less orderly in arrangement, in which the SR is much less prominent and in which the thick filaments are thicker and longer and overlap to an even smaller degree. It is suggested that physiological differences between bloodworm and Ascaris muscles derive from differences in the proportion of series to <b>parallel</b> <b>linkages</b> between the contractile elements, differences in the amount and disposition of the SR, and differences in the impedance to shear within the myofibrils...|$|R
40|$|The {{genetic control}} of {{hexokinase}} isozymes (ATP: d-hexose- 6 -phosphotransferase, E. C. 2. 7. 7. 1, HEX) in maize (Zea mays L.) was studied by starch gel electrophoresis. Genetic {{analysis of a}} large number of inbred lines and crosses indicates that the major isozymes observed are encoded by two nuclear loci, designated Hexl and Hex 2. Five active allozymes and one null variant are associated with Hexl, while Hex 2 has nine active alleles in addition to a null variant. Alleles at both loci govern the presence of single bands, with no intragenic or intergenic heteromers visible, suggesting that maize HEX 2 ̆ 7 s are active as monomers. Organelle preparations demonstrate that the products of both loci are cytosolic. All alleles, including the nulls, segregate normally in crosses. Vigorous and fertile plants were synthesized that were homozygous for null alleles at both loci, suggesting that other hexosephosphorylating enzymes exist in maize that are undetected with our assay conditions. Linkage analyses and crosses with B-A translocation stocks place Hexl on the short arm of chromosome 3, 27 centimorgans from Pgd 2 (phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) and Hex 2 on the long arm of chromosome 6, approximately 45 centimorgans from Pgdl.

The task of the linkage is defined by specifying rigid positions for the workpiece that approximate a desired workspace. Because there are many serial chains available for this design process, the architecture is organized to allow incorporation of individually defined serial chain classes and synthesis routines.

Their integration is demonstrated using a set of classes developed for three position synthesis of spatial RR chains and TS chains.

40|$|Pipeline robots, {{borehole}} robots or exploring robots {{that work}} in underground environments can be classified as underground robots. When an underground robot takes a task, tracing and mapping the track of the robot is very important. This project addresses {{the development of a}} positioning technique for stepwise underground robots, which have been developed in Durham University. This research is expected to provide a general benefit to stepwise robotic positioning systems rather than a particular robotic or other situation. The initial period of this project was the most difficult. After a few months of literature searching, no suitable positioning technique had been found. Existing techniques are suitable for surface robots, undersea robots or airborne robots but are far away from the application requirements for underground robots. Positioning technology depends on sensor techniques and measurement technologies. The underground environment restricts the use of absolute measurement technologies. Consequently, underground robotic positioning systems heavily rely on relative measurements, which can cause unbounded accumulation of the positioning errors. Moreover, underground environments restrict the use of many high precision sensors because of restricted space and other factors. Hence, the feasibility of developing high, long-term, accuracy underground robotic positioning systems was problematic. Since it was found that {{there was a lack of}} research on underground robotic positioning, fundamental investigation became necessary. The fundamentals include the dominant error and the characters of the accumulation of positioning errors. After the investigation of the fundamentals the difficulty and feasibility of developing a high long-term accuracy positioning system was understood more clearly and the key factors to improve the accuracy of a positioning system were known. Based on these, a novel <b>parallel</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanism based approach was proposed. This approach has flexibility in terms of geometrical structure and provides the possibility to improve long-term accuracy of a positioning system. Although <b>parallel</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanisms have drawn a great deal of attention from researchers in passed years, this is the first time a <b>parallel</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanism has been applied to a robotic positioning system. Consequently, new problems were generated by this application of <b>parallel</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanisms. In this project, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is applied to solve the positioning problems and a particular case has been used to show how to solve these problems. Through this case, the advantages of this approach and the feasibility to improve the positioning accuracy is presented. The methodology that can be used to solve the problems for different particular cases can also be used to carry out study for general situations, which have also been illustrated. Many problems still need to be solved. At the end of this thesis, some further problems are discussed. The author of this thesis believes that the proposed approach can be applied to industrial projects in the near future...|$|E

As there are six actuators in the linkage, the redundancy can be overcome by proper selection of the base joint variables. Also it is assumed that the motion is at a constant speed. A numerical example is shown with a straight line trajectory to illustrate the workspace and joint force calculation aspects of this linkage.

50|$|Unlike {{the heavy}} masonry engine house {{used to support}} the beam and pivot of a {{conventional}} beam engine, the grasshopper beam was pivoted on a swinging link. The crankpin was carried directly by the beam and moved {{in a straight line}} vertically, the beam pivot moving slightly sideways on its link to allow this. This simplified the need for a <b>parallel</b> motion <b>linkage</b> on the piston rod. Grasshopper engines were thus lighter than conventional beam engines and could be built completely in factories, rather than requiring considerable erection work to be carried out on-site. This encouraged the use of grasshopper engines for smaller sized engines. Some makers, notably Easton & Amos of Southwark, specialised in such engines. Many were used for pumping, but not for powering large mills.|$|R

Experimental results indicate that the maximum stroke of three vibration axes can reach up to 26 μm. The working bandwidth can reach up to 1889 Hz. The resolution and hysteresis tests show that the developed 3 D EVCG has a good tracking accuracy, relative high resolution and low hysteresis, which is appropriate for micro/nano machining.

40|$|Dystrophin {{mechanically}} {{links the}} costameric cytoskeleton and sarcolemma, yet dystrophin-deficient muscle exhibits abnormalities in cell signaling, gene expression, and contractile function {{that are not}} clearly understood. We generated new antibodies specific for cytoplasmic γ-actin and confirmed that γ-actin most predominantly localized to the sarcolemma and in a faint reticular lattice within normal muscle cells. However, we observed that γ-actin levels were increased 10 -fold at the sarcolemma and within the cytoplasm of striated muscle cells from dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. Transgenic overexpression of the dystrophin homologue utrophin, or functional dystrophin constructs in mdx muscle, restored γ-actin to normal levels, whereas γ-actin remained elevated in mdx muscle expressing nonfunctional dystrophin constructs. We conclude that increased cytoplasmic γ-actin in dystrophin-deficient muscle may be a compensatory response to fortify the weakened costameric lattice through recruitment of <b>parallel</b> mechanical <b>linkages.</b> However, the presence of excessive myoplasmic γ-actin may also contribute to altered cell signaling or gene expression in dystrophin-deficient muscle...|$|R

Väderstad AB develops and manufacture machines that make crop production more efficient for today’s farming. This thesis’ purpose was to improve Väderstad AB’s planter Tempo by developing a floating row cleaner for it. At the time this work took place, row cleaners were bought from external manufacturers. The task was to develop an original design which was supposed to be more efficient and have a lower manufacturing cost than the purchase price for the existing product. To make sure that no solutions to the problem were lost, a systematic concept development method were used throughout the project. The achieved results were complete CAD models of the row cleaner’s design. The design was built up by two discs in V-formation suspended by a <b>parallel</b> <b>linkage.</b> The <b>parallel</b> <b>linkage</b> had an adjustable spring load. Furthermore, prototypes of the discs for the developed row cleaner was manufactured and tested in the field.
