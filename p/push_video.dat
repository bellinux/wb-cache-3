30|$|Fog {{computing}} {{can play}} an important role, where the efficient processing and instantaneous decision-making is required. Take an example of tracking multiple targets in a drone video stream as stated in [63]. Instead of sending live video feeds to a Cloud-based application, it is directed towards the nearest Fog node. Any mobile device such as tablets, smart-phones and laptop can become Fog node, run tracking algorithms and process raw video stream frames, hence removing the latency of transmitting data from the surveillance area to the Cloud. Results show that the addition of a Fog platform reduced an average of 13 % of total processing time. The surveillance video processing can also be performed by using Edge computing and its potential in finding missing children [64]. <b>Pushing</b> <b>video</b> feeds of every camera sensor directly to the Cloud is not possible, but with the help of distributed edge servers and their processing power, each video can be processed individually and the Cloud system can gather the final results to yield a much faster output. Proximal algorithm [65] can also be implemented in the Fog nodes of a large-scale video streaming service, and can resolve joint resource allocation issue.|$|R
40|$|In {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) {{live streaming}} using unstructured mesh, packet scheduling {{is an important}} factor in overall playback delay. In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm to minimize scheduling delay. To achieve low delay, our scheduling is predominantly push in nature, and the schedule needs to be changed only upon significant change in network states (due to, for examples, bandwidth change or parent churns). Our scheme, termed SPANC (Substream Pushing and Network Coding), <b>pushes</b> <b>video</b> packets in substreams and recovers packet loss using network coding. Given heterogeneous contents, delays, and bandwidths of parents of a peer, we formulate the substream assignment (SA) problem to assign substreams to parents with minimum delay. The SA problem can be optimally solved in polynomial time by transforming it to a max-weighted bipartite matching problem. We then formulate the fast recovery with network coding (FRNC) problem, which is to assign network coded packets to each parent to achieve minimum recovery delay. The FRNC problem can also be solved exactly in polynomial time with dynamic programming. Simulation results show that SPANC achieves substantially lower delay with little cost in bandwidth, as compared with recent approaches based on pull, network coding and hybrid pullpush. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R

The {{service is a}} <b>Push</b> <b>video</b> on demand (push VoD) system similar to Top Up TV's TV Favourites, where the Sky+ PVR automatically records programmes transmitted over-night. The service uses 140GB of previously reserved disk space on Sky+ HD boxes hard-disk space whilst on standard Sky+ boxes it uses 80GB of the hard-disk space. The service is intended to provide a catch-up of a selection of the last week's programming. The service was launched on PVR3 Sky+ boxes manufactured by Pace and Amstrad on 24 April 2007. The update for Thomson boxes was delayed because of technical difficulties, it was finally launched for Thomson boxes on 29 May 2007.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Push</b> <b>video</b> {{on demand}} is so-named because the {{provider}} [...] "pushes" [...] the content {{out to the}} viewer's set-top box without the viewer having requested the content. This technique used {{by a number of}} broadcasters on systems that lack the connectivity and bandwidth to provide true [...] "streaming" [...] video on demand. Push VOD is also used by broadcasters who want to optimize their video streaming infrastructure by pre-loading the most popular contents (e.g., that week's top ten films or shows) to the consumers' set-top device. In this way, the most popular content is already loaded onto a consumer's set-top DVR. That way, if the consumer requests one of these films, it is already loaded on her/his DVR. A push VOD system uses a personal video recorder (PVR) to store a selection of content, often transmitted in spare capacity overnight or all day long at low bandwidth. Users can watch the downloaded content at the time they desire, immediately and without any buffering issues. Push VOD depends on the viewer recording content, so choices can be limited.|$|E

40|$|Requests {{from various}} video {{terminals}} <b>push</b> <b>video</b> servers to equip with scalability for video contents distribution in different ways. Scalable Video Coding (SVC) as {{the extension of}} H. 264 /AVC standard can provide the scalability for video servers by encoding videos into one base layer and several enhancement layers. To enable mobile devices without scalability receive videos at their best extent, converting bit-streams from SVC into H. 264 /AVC becomes the key technique. Bit-stream rewriting is the simplest way without quality loss. However, rewriting is not a real transcoding scheme, since it needs to modify SVC encoders. This paper proposes a novel transcoding approach to support spatial scalability by minimizing the distortions generated from re-encoding process. The proposed scheme keeps the input bit-streams’ information at maximum and adopts the hybrid upsampling method to do residue scaling, which can reduce the transcoding distortion into minimization. Experimental results demonstrate {{that the loss of}} the rate-distortion (RD) performance of the proposed transcoding scheme is better than Full Decoding Re-encoding (FDR) which can get the highest video quality in general sense, by achieving up to 0. 9 dB Y-PSNR gain while saving 95 %~ 97 % processing time. </p...|$|E
40|$|Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) {{communication}} {{is a popular}} network communication protocol that impacts and changes the way files being distributed over the large networks. The P 2 P protocol is widely adapted by researchers as a method to handle larger groups of users. Variants of P 2 P protocols have also been applied for other media distributions such as audio and video streaming. P 2 P video streaming largely implemented a mesh-based streaming system that has slowly evolved from a pure pull system to a hybrid push-pull system. In this research, the design component of a P 2 P live streaming system was studied, and focus was given to chunk scheduling and neighbour selection to maximize streaming performance. To solve challenges in chunk scheduling, a hybrid class of push and pull chunk delivery approach was proposed. The proposed rule-based push-pull scheduler simultaneously pull video chunk from lower latency peers to fill up missing chunks in playback buffer and <b>push</b> <b>video</b> chunk for rapid chunk delivery. The proposed solution incorporates the fast content distribution characteristic of mesh-push and data-driven information exchange characteristic of mesh-pull. The performance of proposed rule-based hybrid push-pull scheduling was evaluated by comparing source-to-end delay, chunk collision and video continuity. Mesh-push is made possible by effectively exploiting the information through buffer map exchange. The findings of performance evaluation showed an average of better video continuity and lower source to end delay...|$|E

While there have been large scale empirical studies of Internet, Web and multimedia traffic, the performance of popular Internet streaming video technologies {{and the impact of}} streaming video on the Internet is still largely unkown. This paper presents analysis from a wide-scale empirical study of RealVideo traffic from several Internet servers to many geographically diverse users. We find typical RealVideos to have high quality, achieving an average frame rate of 10 frames per second and very smooth playout, but very few videos achieve full-motion frame rates. Overall video performance is most influenced by the bandwidth of the end-user connection to the Internet, but high-bandwidth Internet connections are <b>pushing</b> the <b>video</b> performance bottleneck closer to the server.
