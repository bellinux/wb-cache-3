50|$|The term <b>product</b> <b>{{assurance}}</b> (PA) {{is often}} used instead of quality assurance and is, alongside project management and engineering, {{one of the three}} primary project functions. Quality assurance is seen as one part of <b>product</b> <b>assurance.</b> Due to the sometimes catastrophic consequences a single failure can have for human lives, the environment, a device, or a mission, <b>product</b> <b>assurance</b> plays a particularly important role here. It has organizational, budgetary and product developmental independence meaning that it reports to highest management only, has its own budget, and does not expend labor to help build a product. <b>Product</b> <b>assurance</b> stands on an equal footing with project management but embraces the customer's point of view.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} common types of {{reliability}} organizations. The project manager or chief engineer may employ {{one or more}} reliability engineers directly.

40|$|For stably normal {{processes}} with one-sided specication limits, capability indices CPU and CPL {{have been}} used to provide numerical measures for <b>product</b> quality <b>assurance</b> from manufacturing perspective. Statistical properties of the estimators of CPU and CPL have been investigated extensively for cases with one single sample. In this paper, we consider testing <b>product</b> quality <b>assurance</b> for cases of several groups of samples with unequal sizes. We obtain the uniform minimum variance unbiased estimators (UMVUEs) of CPU and CPL, and develop a powerful test for that purpose. We also implement Fortran programs to compute the p-values, critical values, for testing <b>product</b> quality <b>assurance.</b> A practical procedure using the UMVUEs is provided to assist the practitioners judging whether their processes are capable of reproducing reliable products. An example of voltage limiting ampli er (VLA) is presented to illustrate the practicality of our approach to actual data collected from the real-world applications...|$|R

50|$|The {{intent of}} this {{specification}} {{is to allow}} the device manufacturer the flexibility to implement best commercial practices to the maximum extent possible while still providing a product which meets the military performance needs. Devices that are compliant to this specification {{are those that are}} capable of meeting the verification requirements outlined herein; and are built on a manufacturing line which is controlled by the manufacturer's quality management program and has been certified and qualified in accordance with the requirements herein. The certification and qualification requirements outlined herein are the requirements to be met by a manufacturer to be listed on the QML. The manufacturer may modify, substitute or delete the tests and inspections defined herein. This is accomplished by baselining a flow of tests and inspections that will assure that the devices are capable of meeting the generic verifications provided in this specification. This {{does not necessarily mean that}} compliant devices have been subjected to the generic performance verifications provided in this specification, just that compliant devices are capable of meeting them. It is the manufacturer's responsibility to ensure that their devices are capable of meeting the generic performance verifications applicable to each specified <b>product</b> <b>assurance</b> level.|$|E

40|$|<b>Product</b> <b>assurance</b> is an {{essential}} part of product development process if developers want to ensure that ï¬nal product is safe and reliable. <b>Product</b> <b>assurance</b> can be supported withrisk management and with different failure analysis methods. <b>Product</b> <b>assurance</b> is emphasized in system development process of mission critical systems. The <b>product</b> <b>assurance</b> process in systems of this kind requires extra attention. Inthis thesis, mission critical systems are space systems and the <b>product</b> <b>assurance</b> processof these systems is presented with help of space standards. The <b>product</b> <b>assurance</b> process can be supported with agile development because agile emphasizes transparency of the process and fast response to changes. Even if the development process of space systems is highly standardized and reminds waterfall model, it is still possible to adapt agile development in space systems development. This thesisaims to support the <b>product</b> <b>assurance</b> process of space systems with agile developmentso that the ï¬nal product would be as safe and reliable as possible.
