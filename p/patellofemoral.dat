25|$|Some {{advantages}} of the graft include less trauma to the leg that has undergone the ACL revision. Patients regain their range of motion and leg strength on the newly repaired ACL leg much quicker. The graft also allows for a bone-to-bone fixation which allows for more aggressive rehabilitation. The patient also eliminates the chance of any potential complications such as disease transmission that would be present if an allograph was chosen. The dis{{advantages of}} the graft include infection at this site, anterior knee pain, quadriceps muscle weakness, loss of motion, patella fracture, <b>patellofemoral</b> crepitus, patellar tendonitis, and <b>patellofemoral</b> joint pain. Also, {{it is not uncommon}} in certain patient populations to rupture the contralateral ACL following return to their sport. By harvesting the patellar tendon from the opposite knee, the orthopedic surgeon no longer has the option of using that patellar tendon for the reconstruction. It has been noted that a low percentage of patients have suffered a patellar tendon rupture in the first few weeks after surgery due to the increased stress to the area. In addition to a longer operating time the patient will have two scars instead of one.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{injuries}} in running involve the knees and the feet. Various {{studies have focused}} on the initial cause of these running related injuries and found that there are many factors that correlate to these injuries. Female distance runners who had a history of stress fracture injuries had higher vertical impact forces than non-injured subjects. The large forces onto the lower legs were associated with gravitational forces, and this correlated with <b>patellofemoral</b> pain or potential knee injuries. [...] Researchers have also found that these running related injuries affect the feet as well because runners with previous injuries showed more foot eversion and over pronation while running than non-injured runners. This causes more loads and forces on the medial side of the foot, causing more stress on the tendons of the foot and ankle (peroneal tendons). Most of these running injuries are caused by overuse and that running at longer distances weekly for a long duration is a risk for injuring the lower legs.|$|E
2500|$|Unicompartmental {{arthroplasty}} (UKA), {{also called}} partial knee replacement, {{is an option}} for some patients. The knee is generally divided into three [...] "compartments": medial (the inside part of the knee), lateral (the outside), and <b>patellofemoral</b> (the joint between the kneecap and the thighbone). Most patients with arthritis severe enough to consider knee replacement have significant wear in {{two or more of}} the above compartments and are best treated with total knee replacement. A minority of patients (the exact percentage is hotly debated but is probably between 10 and 30 percent) have wear confined primarily to one compartment, usually the medial, and may be candidates for unicompartmental knee replacement. Advantages of UKA compared to TKA include smaller incision, easier post-op rehabilitation, better post-operative range of motion, shorter hospital stay, less blood loss, lower risk of infection, stiffness, and blood clots, but a harder revision if necessary. While most recent data suggests that UKA in properly selected patients has survival rates comparable to TKA, most surgeons believe that TKA is the more reliable long term procedure. Persons with infectious or inflammatory arthritis (Rheumatoid, Lupus, Psoriatic), or marked deformity are not candidates for this procedure.|$|E

50|$|In this condition, the patella repetitively subluxates {{and places}} {{strain on the}} medial {{restraints}} and excessive stress/tension on the <b>patellofemoral</b> joint. Patellar subluxation {{can be caused by}} osseous abnormalities, such as incorrect articulation of the femoral groove with the patella, trochlear dysplasia, or patella alta, which is a distance of greater than 20 mm between the tibial tubercle and the trochlear groove. It can also result from soft-tissue abnormalities, such as a torn medial <b>patellofemoral</b> ligament, or a weakened vastus medialis obliquus. Symptoms are regulated by the amount of activity. Such pain is commonly caused by running and jumping sports and activities that place large forces on the <b>patellofemoral</b> joint.|$|E

50|$|Physical {{fitness is}} related {{integrally}} {{to the development}} of knee problems. The same activity such as climbing stairs may cause pain from <b>patellofemoral</b> compression for someone who is physically unfit, but not for someone else (or even for that person at a different time). Obesity is another major contributor to knee pain. For instance, a 30-year-old woman who weighed 120 lb at age 18 years, before her three pregnancies, and now weighs 285 lb, had added 660 lb of force across her <b>patellofemoral</b> joint with each step.|$|E

50|$|The patella is a {{triangular}} sesamoid bone which {{is embedded in}} tendon. It rests in the <b>patellofemoral</b> groove, an articular cartilage-lined hollow {{at the end of}} the thigh bone (femur) where the thigh bone meets the shin bone (tibia). Several ligaments and tendons hold the patella in place and allow it to move up and down the <b>patellofemoral</b> groove when the leg bends. The top of the patella attaches to the quadriceps muscle via the quadriceps tendon, the middle to the vastus medialis obliquus and vastus lateralis muscles, and the bottom to the head of the tibia (tibial tuberosity) via the patellar tendon, which is a continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon. The medial <b>patellofemoral</b> ligament attaches horizontally in the inner knee to the adductor magnus tendon and is the structure most often damaged during a patellar dislocation. Finally, the lateral collateral ligament and the medial collateral ligament stabilize the patella on either side. Any of these structures can sustain damage during a patellar dislocation.|$|E

5000|$|A 2011 {{systematic}} review stated that evidence supports {{the use of}} quadriceps exercise for managing <b>patellofemoral</b> pain syndrome and that quadriceps strengthening {{is considered to be}} the [...] "gold" [...] standard treatment for <b>patellofemoral</b> pain syndrome. Quadriceps strengthening is commonly suggested because the quadriceps muscles help to stabilize the patella. Quadriceps weakness and quadriceps muscle imbalance may contribute to abnormal patellar tracking. If the strength of the vastus medialis muscle is inadequate, the usually larger and stronger vastus lateralis muscle will pull sideways (laterally) on the kneecap. Strengthening the vastus medialis to prevent or counter the lateral force of the vastus lateralis is one way of relieving PFPS. Moderate evidence supports the addition of hip abductor and external rotator strengthening, as well as exercises targeting hip flexion and hip extension. When executing these exercises, proper form is very important {{in order to ensure that}} the musculature is activated in such a way that will not lead to further injury. Inflexibility has often been cited as a source of <b>patellofemoral</b> pain syndrome. Stretching of the laterial knee has been suggested to help.|$|E

50|$|Age also {{contributes}} to disorders of the knee. Particularly in older people, knee pain frequently arises due to osteoarthritis. In addition, weakening of tissues around the knee {{may contribute to the}} problem. <b>Patellofemoral</b> instability may relate to hip abnormalities or to tightness of surrounding ligaments.|$|E

50|$|An {{effective}} {{rehabilitation program}} reduces {{the chances of}} reinjury and of other knee-related problems such as <b>patellofemoral</b> pain syndrome and osteoarthritis.

50|$|Knee pain {{is caused}} by trauma, misalignment, and {{degeneration}} {{as well as by}} conditions like arthritis. The most common knee disorder is generally known as <b>patellofemoral</b> syndrome.The majority of minor cases of knee pain can be treated at home with rest and ice but more serious injuries do require surgical care.|$|E
50|$|The medial <b>patellofemoral</b> {{ligament}} (or MPFL) {{is one of}} {{the several}} ligaments on the medial aspect of the knee. It originates on the superomedial aspect of the patella and inserts in the space between the adductor tubercle and the medial femoral epicondyle. Its main function is to prevent lateral displacement of the patella.|$|E
50|$|The {{knee joint}} {{consists}} of an articulation between four bones: the femur, tibia, fibula and patella. There are four compartments to the knee. These are the medial and lateral tibiofemoral compartments, the <b>patellofemoral</b> compartment and the superior tibiofibular joint. The components {{of each of these}} compartments can suffer from repetitive strain, injury or disease.|$|E
