40|$|Increasing {{capabilities}} of intelligent video surveillance systems impose new threats to privacy while, {{at the same}} time, offering opportunities for reducing the privacy invasiveness of <b>surveillance</b> <b>measures</b> {{as well as their}} selectivity. We show that aggregating more data about observed people does not necessarily lead to less privacy, but can increase the selectivity of <b>surveillance</b> <b>measures.</b> In case of video surveillance in a company environment, if we enable the system to authenticate employees and to know their current positions, we can ensure that no data about employees leaves the surveillance system, i. e., is being visualized or made accessible to an operator. In contrast, due to their lack of computer vision intelligence, conventional video surveillance systems do by design treat each person's privacy equally, independent of whether one has to spend the whole work day under surveillance (e. g. personnel of an airport) or occasionally a limited amount of time (e. g. air passengers). We conceive our approach towards improving the selectivity of video <b>surveillance</b> <b>measures</b> as an interpretation of the principle of proportionality in law...|$|R

40|$|Background. Candidemia {{is common}} and {{associated}} with high morbidity and mortality; changes in popula-tion-based incidence rates have not been reported. Methods. We conducted active, population-based surveillance in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and Baltimore City/County, Maryland (combined population 5. 2 million), during 2008 – 2011. We calculated candidemia incidence and antifungal drug resistance compared with <b>prior</b> <b>surveillance</b> (Atlanta, 1992 – 1993; Baltimore, 1998 – 2000). Results. We identified 2675 cases of candidemia with 2329 isolates during 3 years of surveillance. Mean annual crude incidence per 100 000 person-years was 13. 3 in Atlanta and 26. 2 in Baltimore. Rates were highest among adults aged ≥ 65 years (Atlanta, 59. 1; Baltimore, 72. 4) and infants (aged < 1 year; Atlanta, 34. 3; Baltimore, 46. 2).
