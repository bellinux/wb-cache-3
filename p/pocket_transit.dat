50|$|A Brunton compass, {{properly}} {{known as}} the Brunton <b>Pocket</b> <b>Transit,</b> {{is a type of}} precision compass made by Brunton, Inc. of Riverton, Wyoming. The instrument was patented in 1894 by a Canadian-born Colorado geologist named David W. Brunton. Unlike most modern compasses, the Brunton <b>Pocket</b> <b>Transit</b> utilizes magnetic induction damping rather than fluid to damp needle oscillation. Although Brunton Inc. makes many other types of magnetic compasses, the Brunton <b>Pocket</b> <b>Transit</b> is a specialized instrument used widely by those needing to make accurate degree and angle measurements in the field. These people are primarily geologists, but archaeologists, environmental engineers, and surveyors also make use of the Brunton's capabilities. The United States Army has adopted the <b>Pocket</b> <b>Transit</b> as the M2 Compass for use by crew-served artillery.|$|E

5000|$|As William Ainsworth Inc., Brunton {{continued}} {{production of}} the Pocket Transit™, later adopted by the U.S. Army as the M2 Artillery Compass. The <b>Pocket</b> <b>Transit</b> remains in production today, and is offered in numerous versions and configurations. In 1970, the company introduced the Brunton Cadet, a much-simplified evolution of the <b>Pocket</b> <b>Transit</b> incorporating a compass and clinometer, intended for use in training students {{in the fields of}} geology, forestry, mining, and surveying. [...] The company soon began marketing the Cadet to instruct Boy Scouts in the principles of surveying. [...] In 1972, the newly formed Brunton Company, Inc. began compass and transit production in Riverton, Wyoming. Compasses included the <b>Pocket</b> <b>Transit,</b> Cadet, and an emergency compass called the Life Card, designed to float in a bowl of water. This was followed in 1981 by the Model 8040 Sportsman's Compass™, a map (baseplate) compass with folding cover and mirror sight, and the Model 9020, a small baseplate compass intended for general use by hikers, outdoorsmen, and hunters.|$|E

5000|$|The {{difference}} between a transit case and a suit case is a transit case is configured with internal foam or other structure to hold and protect specific items. A suit case is an empty case in which items can be placed in any order with no predefined locations other than features such as internal <b>pockets.</b> An empty <b>transit</b> case {{can be used as}} a suit case.|$|R

Researchers used accessibility measures to assess equity issues, such as determining the amount of jobs reachable by marginalized groups within a defined travel time threshold and compare these measures across socioeconomic categories. However, allocating public transit resources in an equitable manner is not only related to travel time, but also related to the out-of- <b>pocket</b> cost of <b>transit</b> fares, which can represent a major barrier to accessibility for many disadvantaged groups. Therefore, this research proposes a set of new accessibility measures that incorporates both travel time and transit fares. It then applies those measures to determine whether people residing in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in other neighborhoods. Results are presented in terms of regional accessibility and trends by social indicator decile. Travel time accessibility measures estimate a higher number of jobs that can be reached compared to combined travel time and cost measures. However, the degree and impact of these measures varies across the social deciles. Compared to other groups in the region, residents of socially disadvantaged areas have more equitable accessibility to jobs using transit; this is reflected in smaller decreases in accessibility when fare costs are included. Generating new measures of accessibility combining travel time and transit fares provides more accurate measures {{that can be easily}} communicated by transportation planners and engineers to policy makers and the public since it translates accessibility measures to a dollar value.

5000|$|Founded in 1895 by David W. Brunton, a Canadian-born {{geologist}} {{and mining}} engineer, and William Ainsworth, a skilled watch repairman, {{the firm is}} most famous for its earliest product, the Brunton Pocket Transit®, a compass and measuring tool used by geologists, foresters, surveyors, and archaeologists. [...] Often simply called a [...] "Brunton", the <b>Pocket</b> <b>Transit</b> was first patented in 1894 by David Brunton, who commissioned William Ainsworth & Sons to manufacture his invention in Denver, Colorado. [...] The company later incorporated as William Ainsworth Inc. and for many years produced the <b>Pocket</b> <b>Transit</b> along with surveying transits, theodolites, and other instruments.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in 1965, William Ainsworth Inc. {{was owned}} {{by a series of}} {{corporate}} conglomerates, and product quality varied as the company changed hands repeatedly. In 1972, a group of Riverton, Wyoming businessmen bought the company and formed Brunton, Inc. The company was moved to Riverton, Wyoming where it began producing a new series of recreational outdoors compasses, hunting knives, and binoculars in addition to the Brunton <b>Pocket</b> <b>Transit.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Pocket</b> <b>Transit</b> may be {{adjusted}} for declination angle according to one's {{location on the}} Earth. It is used to get directional degree measurements (azimuth) through use of the Earth's magnetic field. Holding the compass at waist-height, the user looks down into the mirror and lines up the target, needle, and guide line {{that is on the}} mirror. Once all three are lined up and the compass is level, the reading for that azimuth can be made. Arguably the most frequent use for the Brunton in the field is the calculation of the strike and dip of geological features (faults, contacts, foliation, sedimentary strata, etc.). If next to the feature, the strike is measured by leveling (with the bull's eye level) the compass along the plane being measured. Dip is taken by laying the side of the compass perpendicular to the strike measurement and rotating horizontal level until the bubble is stable and the reading has been made. If properly used and if field conditions allow, additional features of the compass allow users to measure such geological attributes from a distance.|$|E
