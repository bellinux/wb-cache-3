40|$|Complexes of the {{stoichiometry}} RHg(GuoH- 1), [RHg(Guo) ]N 03, and [(RHg) 2 GUOH- 1]NO 3 {{have been}} synthesized by {{reaction of the}} nucleoside guanosine (Guo) and RHg(II) in water (R = Me) or aqueous ethanol (R = Ph). Comparison of infrared spectra of the solid complexes and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the complexes in dimethyl-d 6 sulfoxide with spectra of Guo, [GuoH]N 03, and Na[GuoH- 1]. H 20 allows assignment of structures for these ambidentate ligand complexes. Deprotonation of N 1 of Guo leads to coordination of RHg(II) at N 1 in RHg(GuoH- 1) and to both N 1 and N 7 in [(RHg) 2 GuoH-l]N 03. The complexes [RHg(Guo) ]N 03 have RHg(II) bonded at N 7 of the guanine base. <b>Phenylmercuric</b> <b>hydroxide</b> reacts with thymidine (dThd) in aqueous ethanol to form PhHg(dThdH- 1). H 20 with PhHg(II) bonded to N 3 after deprotonation of dThd. Structures deduced for these solid complexes are in agreement with those suggested in earlier ultraviolet and Raman studies of the interaction of nucleosides and nucleotides with MeHg(II) in aqueous solution. The uses and limitations of vibrational spectra in assigning structures to such metal nucleoside complexes are outlined...|$|E
