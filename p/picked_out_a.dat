2500|$|In November 1868, {{following}} the Battle of Washita River, Custer was alleged (by Captain Frederick Benteen, chief of scouts Ben Clark, and Cheyenne oral tradition) to have unofficially married Mo-nah-se-tah, {{daughter of the}} Cheyenne chief Little Rock in the winter or early spring of 1868–1869 (Little Rock {{was killed in the}} one-day action at Washita on November 27). Mo-nah-se-tah gave birth to a child in January 1869, two months after the Washita battle. Cheyenne oral history tells that she also bore a second child, fathered by Custer in late 1869.
