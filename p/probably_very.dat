5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E

25|$|Other {{examples}} of stone runs occur in England, most notably at the Stiperstones, Shropshire. They are also known in Pennsylvania. Small examples are <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> widespread where solifluction deposits contain large concentrations of frost-resistant rock blocks.|$|E

25|$|These early uses {{appear to}} have been largely {{ceremonial}} or ornamental. Meteoritic iron is very rare, and the metal was <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> expensive, perhaps more expensive than gold. The early Hittites are known to have bartered iron (meteoritic or smelted) for silver, at a rate of 40 times the iron's weight, with Assyria.|$|E
25|$|Black-footed smallish marine shags of Europe and {{southern}} Africa. Wahlberg's cormorant is very tentatively placed here; it seems anatomically {{more similar to}} the P. fuscscens, but the more informative characters – the combination of frontal crest and lack of extensive naked skin at bill base in mid-sized Old World species – seem to place it here. If this is correct, they are <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> distantly related due to biogeography.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} immigration {{was that}} of the Germans (the majority from Pomerania — see Pomeranians), even though they preferred to settle in rural areas, unlike the Portuguese, who settled in the city itself. Also worthy to mention are other ethnicities that settled in Pelotas, such as Africans (descendants of slaves, mainly from Angola), Italians, Poles, French, Jews, Lebanese Arabs, etc. The number of descendants from indigenous peoples, despite being unknown, is <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> small.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{promises}} of Selman Reis, Habesh did not provide much revenue for the Ottomans, partly because the spice trade was not very profitable, but more importantly because the rich hinterlands were unconquered, with the Ottomans holding only the dry and hot coasts. Given that Yemen often cost more in upkeep than it sent to Constantinople as taxes, and that Habesh had much less {{in the way of}} agricultural taxes (but just as high a salary for the beylerbeyi), the province was <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> unprofitable.|$|E
25|$|During most {{of human}} {{prehistory}} groups of hunter-gatherers were <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> small. Such groups probably {{made contact with}} other such bands only rarely. Such isolation would have caused epidemic diseases to be restricted to any given local population, because propagation and expansion of epidemics depend on frequent contact with other individuals {{who have not yet}} developed an adequate immune response. To persist in such a population, a pathogen either had to be a chronic infection, staying present and potentially infectious in the infected host for long periods, or it had to have other additional species as reservoir where it can maintain itself until further susceptible hosts are contacted and infected. In fact, for many 'human' diseases, the human is actually better viewed as an accidental or incidental victim and a dead-end host. Examples include rabies, anthrax, tularemia and West Nile virus. Thus, much of human exposure to infectious disease has been zoonotic.|$|E

500|$|The autumn {{celebration in}} late 1621 {{that has become}} known as [...] "The First Thanksgiving" [...] was not known as such to the Pilgrims. The first [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] as the Pilgrims would have called it (referring to solemn {{ceremony}} of praise and thanks to God for a congregation's good fortune) did not occur until 1623, in response to the good news of the arrival of additional colonists and supplies. That event probably occurred in July and consisted of a full day of prayer and worship and <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> little revelry.|$|E
500|$|Caron and Jackson used {{computer}} software {{to simulate the}} numbers of species that would be found if smaller numbers of specimens were included, {{and found that the}} number of species [...] "discovered" [...] kept increasing as the number of specimens increased, rather than reaching a plateau. This suggests that Burgess Shale probably still contains as-yet undiscovered species, although <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> rare ones. Some recently discovered species, known in 2008 only by nicknames like [...] "woolly bear" [...] and [...] "Siamese lantern" [...] are familiar to the collecting teams, but have yet to be formally described and named. The team also nicknamed another discovery as [...] "Creeposaurus", and in 2010 this animal was described and formally named Herpetogaster.|$|E
500|$|YouTube {{was founded}} by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim, who were all early {{employees}} of PayPal. Hurley had studied design at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and Chen and Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. According to {{a story that has}} often been repeated in the media, Hurley and Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco. Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party [...] "was <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible".|$|E

500|$|... "Ekbletomys hypenemus" [...] {{is known}} from {{material}} from two small limestone caves at Two Foot Bay {{at the eastern}} side of the island of Barbuda, Antigua and Barbuda and from a site named Mill Reef in the far east of Antigua, also in Antigua and Barbuda, which has not been described in detail. In both Barbuda caves, the [...] "Ekbletomys" [...] material was found in red to yellow unconsolidated sediments on the cave floor which were partially overlain by a darker sediment that yielded the introduced Rattus, indicating deposition after the first European contact around 1500. These sediments are probably ancient owl pellets deposited by a burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) and they also yielded the frog Eleutherodactylus johnstonei; the lizards Thecadactylus rapicauda, Ameiva griswoldi, and Anolis leachii; the birds Puffinus lherminieri, Zenaida aurita, Columbina passerina, Tiaris bicolor, and an unidentified fringillid; and the bats Mormoops blainvillei, Brachyphylla cavernarum, Natalus stramineus, Tadarida brasiliensis, and Molossus molossus. The deposits that included [...] "Ekbletomys" [...] are <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> late Quaternary, but pre-Columbian, and the Antigua material ranges in age from about 2500 BCE to post-Columbian.|$|E
500|$|Bridges left Brackley in {{the summer}} and signed for Northern Premier League side King's Lynn Town in May 2014. On {{securing}} the signing of Bridges for the season, manager Gary Setchell stated [...] "I’m <b>probably</b> <b>very,</b> very fortunate I’ve stumbled across Bridgo when he’s got a lot going on outside of football, business wise". Whilst out injured, and having already obtained his UEFA 'B' coaching badge, Bridges was made first-team coach at the club in February 2015. He combined the role alongside continuing to play in the first-team. King's Lynn were moved into the Southern Premier League for the 201516 campaign and Bridges continued to feature regularly in the Linnets midfield during the campaign, making 39 appearances in all competitions. Bridges retired from playing in May 2016 to [...] "concentrate on his successful business ventures and spend time with his family". On his retirement, manager Setchell said “David will be missed {{by a lot of people}} at the football club but I totally understand his decision to call it a day on his fantastic playing career and pursue his business interests and spend more time with his young family.” ...|$|E
500|$|The optical {{properties}} of the halo ring {{can be explained by}} the hypothesis that it comprises only dust with particle sizes less than 15μm. Parts of the halo located far from the ring plane may consist of submicrometre dust. This dusty composition explains the much stronger forward-scattering, bluer colors and lack of visible structure in the halo. The dust probably originates in the main ring, a claim supported by the fact that the halo’s optical depth [...] is comparable with that of the dust in the main ring. The large thickness of the halo can be attributed to the excitation of orbital inclinations and eccentricities of dust particles by the electromagnetic forces in the Jovian magnetosphere. The outer boundary of the halo ring coincides with location of a strong 3:2 Lorentz resonance. As Poynting–Robertson drag causes particles to slowly drift towards Jupiter, their orbital inclinations are excited while passing through it. The bloom of the main ring may be a beginning of the halo. The halo ring’s inner boundary is not far from the strongest 2:1 Lorentz resonance. In this resonance the excitation is <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> significant, forcing particles to plunge into the Jovian atmosphere thus defining a sharp inner boundary. Being derived from the main ring, the halo has the same age.|$|E

500|$|Stanton {{wanted the}} Axioms {{interior}} to resemble Shanghai and Dubai. Eggleston studied 1960s NASA paintings {{and the original}} concept art for Tomorrowland for the Axiom, to reflect that era's sense of optimism. Stanton remarked [...] "We are all <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> similar in our backgrounds here [...] in that we all miss the Tomorrowland that was promised us from the heyday of Disneyland," [...] and wanted a [...] "jet pack" [...] feel. Pixar also studied the Disney Cruise Line and visited Las Vegas, which was helpful in understanding artificial lighting. Eggleston based his Axiom designs on the futuristic architecture of Santiago Calatrava. Eggleston divided {{the inside of the}} ship into three sections; the rear's economy class has a basic gray concrete texture with graphics keeping to the red, blue, and white of the BnL logo. The coach class with living/shopping spaces has [...] "S" [...] shapes as people are always looking for [...] "what's around the corner". Stanton intended to have many colorful signs, but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston's original idea of a small number of larger signs. The premier class is a large Zen-like spa with colors limited to turquoise, cream, and tan, and leads on to the captain's warm carpeted and wooded quarters and the sleek dark bridge. In keeping with the artificial Axiom, camera movements were modeled after those of the steadicam.|$|E
500|$|The age of {{the last}} {{eruption}} is controversial. In 1994, radiocarbon dating yielded an age of 10,700 ± 800 years Before Present from a pyroclastic flow. Later, paleosoils and other samples from the same flow were used to deduce similar ages of over 36,770, 42,650, over 35,670 and over 35,520 years before present, respectively. Thus this youngest age estimate was discarded. In 2010, further research identified two younger eruptions, one occurring 39,000 years Before Present and the other 27,500 years Before Present. Other data obtained by uranium-thorium dating indicate an age of 32,600 ± 1,000 years ago for the youngest eruption. Both of these eruptions took place at St. Ana and imply a repose period between eruptions of over 10,000 years. Much older dates obtained by potassium-argon dating are not considered reliable. Alternatively, the latest eruption may have occurred at a satellite vent seeing as sedimentation of the St. Ana lake has been ongoing since 26,000 years ago. These two recent eruptions were fed by different magmas, with the younger eruption coming from deeper magma chambers ( [...] versus [...] ) and involving more primitive magma. The youngest eruption was <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> violent; the Roxolany Tephra which {{may be associated with}} it has been found as far as Odessa, Ukraine, [...] away from Ciomadul. If the Roxolany Tephra was formed by the youngest eruption of Ciomadul, the youngest eruption would have occurred 29,600 calibrated radiocarbon years ago based on independent dates of the tephra.|$|E
500|$|Titan, at 5,150km diameter, is {{the second}} largest moon in the Solar System and Saturn's largest. Out of all the large moons, Titan {{is the only one}} with a dense (surface {{pressure}} of 1.5atm), cold atmosphere, primarily made of nitrogen with a small fraction of methane. The dense atmosphere frequently produces bright white convective clouds, especially over the south pole region. On June 6, 2013, scientists at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan. On June 23, 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times. The surface of Titan, which is difficult to observe due to persistent atmospheric haze, shows only a few impact craters and is <b>probably</b> <b>very</b> young. It contains a pattern of light and dark regions, flow channels and possibly cryovolcanos. Some dark regions are covered by longitudinal dune fields shaped by tidal winds, where sand is made of frozen water or hydrocarbons. Titan is the only body in the Solar System beside Earth with bodies of liquid on its surface, in the form of methane–ethane lakes in Titan's north and south polar regions. The largest lake, Kraken Mare, is larger than the Caspian Sea. Like Europa and Ganymede, it is believed that Titan has a subsurface ocean made of water mixed with ammonia, which can erupt {{to the surface of the}} moon and lead to cryovolcanism. On July 2, 2014, NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be [...] "as salty as the Earth's Dead Sea".|$|E
