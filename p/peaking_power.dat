5|$|A British Wind Energy Association report {{gives an}} average {{generation}} cost of onshore wind power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005). Cost {{per unit of}} energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above the cost of new generating capacity in the US for coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50. Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011. In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants; {{it is also expected}} that wind power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future. The presence of wind energy, even when subsidised, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimising the use of expensive <b>peaking</b> <b>power</b> plants.|$|E
5|$|Trinity River Division is {{the second}} large CVP {{department}} for the northern Sacramento Valley. The {{primary purpose of the}} division is to divert water from the Trinity River into the Sacramento River drainage downstream of Shasta Dam in order to provide more flow in the Sacramento River and generating <b>peaking</b> <b>power</b> in the process. Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake, the second largest CVP water-storage reservoir, with just over half the capacity of Shasta and a generating capacity of 140 MW. Lewiston Dam, downstream of Trinity Dam, diverts water into the Clear Creek Tunnel, which travels to empty into a third reservoir, Whiskeytown Lake on Clear Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River, generating 154 MW of power in the process. Whiskeytown Lake (formed by Clair. A Hill Whiskeytown Dam) in turn provides water to the Spring Creek Tunnel, which travels into the lowermost extreme of Spring Creek, a stream that flows into Keswick Reservoir, generating another 180 MW of electricity. From there the water from the Trinity River empties into Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. In 1963, the Spring Creek Debris Dam was constructed just upstream of the outlet of the Spring Creek Tunnel, to prevent acid mine drainage from the Iron Mountain Mine from continuing downstream and contaminating the river.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that an intense neutron source {{can be produced}} in a suitable target by spallation neutrons generated by a high-current high-energy proton beam. Typical beam energy for such an accelerator is 400 to 2000 MeV. A conventional critical reactor can readily {{be replaced by a}} ''sub-critical reactor'' driven by this source. A 5 MW proton beam at 600 MeV can drive a sub-critical reactor to 100 MWt. The accelerator and the associated plant support equipment at these design specifications are complex systems, but they are well within recent technology. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine core design and shielding design issues for a 100 MWt sodium-cooled fast-spectrum Sub-Critical Multiplier (SCM- 100) based on LMFBR technology, but driven by an intense neutron source created by spallation reactions. SCM- 100 is a component of the Accelerator Driven Test Facility. In this report we provide an overview of the SCM- 100 concept. Two designs were investigated: (1) a vertical entry for the beam on the axial centerline; and (2) an inclined entry design where the core is ''C'' shaped and the beam enters the side of the target at an angle of 32 degrees. A brief overview of relevant shielding design data from EBR-II is also provided. The key result of this report is that the inclined entry design cannot achieve design objectives for radial <b>power</b> <b>peaking.</b> Consequently it cannot achieve design objectives for peak neutron flux. Axial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> factors are controlled by the axial fuel height and the axial reflector properties. These dimensions and compositions are very similar in SCM- 100 to those of EBR-II. EBR-II had an axial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> factor of 1. 093, and a radial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> factor of about 1. 46. The radial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> of SCM- 100 with the inclined entry is too extreme at 2. 15, and cannot be made acceptable by modifying the size and detailed shape of the ''C'' shaped core and reflector. The axial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> of SCM- 100 is very close to that of EBR-II. Although these conclusions were obtained using EBR-II Mark-IIIA fuel elements of a single enrichment, they are expected to be true for any single-enrichment fuel design with a similar active fuel height and similar k-infinity. Shielding of the grid plate was also investigated. The lower axial reflector thickness necessary to achieve the design lifetime was found to be 75 cm...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of burnable absorbers (BA) for minimization of <b>power</b> <b>peaking,</b> reactivity loss and capture to fission probabilities in an accelerator driven waste transmutation system (ADS, ATW) has been investigated. 10 B enriched B 4 C absorber rods were introduced into a lead/bismuth cooled core fuelled with TRU discharges from light water reactors {{in order to}} achieve smallest possible <b>power</b> <b>peakings</b> at a BOL sub-criticality level of 0. 97. Detailed Monte Carlo simulations show that a radial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> equal to 1. 2 at BOL is attainable using a four zone differentiation in BA content. Using a newly written Monte Carlo Burnup code (MCB), reactivity losses were calculated to be 640 pcm per percent transuranium burnup, for unrecycled TRU discharges. Comparing to corresponding values in BA free cores, BA introduction diminishes reactivity losses in TRU fuelled sub-critical cores by about 20 %. Radial <b>power</b> <b>peaking</b> after 300 days of operation at 1200 MW thermal power was less than 1. 75 at a sub-criticality level of 0. 92, which appears to be acceptable, with respect to limitations in cladding and fuel temperatures.
