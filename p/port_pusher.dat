5000|$|Tesla's {{oscillator}} is a reciprocating electricity generator. Steam {{would be}} forced into the oscillator, and exit {{through a series of}} <b>ports,</b> <b>pushing</b> a piston up and down that was attached to an armature, causing it to vibrate up and down at high speed, producing electricity. The casing was by necessity very strong, as temperatures due to pressure heating in the upper chamber exceeded 200 degrees, and the pressure reached 400psi. Some versions used air trapped behind the piston as an [...] "air spring", increasing efficiency. Another variation used electromagnets to control the frequency of the piston's oscillation.|$|R
2500|$|According to Morris, [...] "The Haganah mortar {{attacks of}} 21–22 April [...] were {{primarily}} designed to break Arab morale {{in order to}} bring about a swift collapse of resistance and speedy surrender. [...] But clearly the offensive, and especially the mortaring, precipitated the exodus. The three-inch mortars [...] "opened up on the market square [...] a great crowd [...] a great panic took hold. The multitude burst into the <b>port,</b> <b>pushed</b> aside the policemen, charged the boats and began to flee the town", as the official Haganah history later put it." [...] According to Pappé, this mortar barrage was deliberately aimed at civilians to precipitate their flight from Haifa.|$|R
5|$|Trying {{to come up}} with {{a better}} way to {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of <b>ports,</b> <b>pushing</b> a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.|$|R

2500|$|O'Hare {{was last}} seen at the 5 o'clock {{position}} of the TBF. About that time, the turret gunner of the TBF, Alvin Kernan (AOM1/c) noticed a Japanese G4M Betty bomber above and almost directly behind O'Hare's 6 o'clock position. Kernan opened fire with the TBF's [...]50-cal. machine gun in the dorsal turret and a Japanese gunner fired back. Butch O'Hare's F6F Hellcat apparently {{was caught in a}} crossfire. Seconds later Butch's F6F slid out of formation to <b>port,</b> <b>pushing</b> slightly ahead at about 160 knots and then vanished in the dark. The Avenger pilot, Lieutenant Commander Phillips, called repeatedly to O'Hare but received no reply. Ensign Skon responded: [...] "Mr. Phillips, this is Skon. I saw Mr. O'Hare's lights go out and, at the same instant, he seemed to veer off and slant down into darkness." [...] Phillips later asserted, as the Hellcat dropped out of view, it seemed to release something drop almost vertically at a speed too slow for anything but a parachute. Then something [...] "whitish-gray" [...] appeared below, perhaps the splash of the aircraft plunging into the sea.|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} interest in peer-topeer (P 2 P) traffic {{because of its}} remarkable increase {{over the last few}} years. By analyzing flow measurements at the border routers of a Tier- 1 ISP backbone that carry broadband traffic, we are able to study its properties. P 2 P has become a large part of broadband traffic and its characteristics are different from older applications, such as the Web. It is a stable balanced traffic: the peak to valley ratio during a day is around two and the IN/OUT traffic balance is close to one. Although P 2 P protocols are based on a distributed architecture, they don’t show strong signs of geographical locality. A broadband subscriber is not much more likely to download a file from a close region than from a far region. It is clear that most of the traffic is generated by heavy hitters who “abuse ” P 2 P (and other) applications, whereas most of the subscribers only use their broadband connections to browse the web, exchange emails or chat. However {{it is not easy to}} directly block or limit P 2 P traffic, because these applications adapt themselves to their environment: the users develop ways of eluding the traffic blocks. The traffic that could historically be identified with five port numbers is now spread over thousands of TCP <b>ports,</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>port</b> based identification to its limits. More complex methods to identify P 2 P traffic are not a long-term solution, the cable industry should opt for a “pay for what you use ” model like the other utilities...|$|R

5000|$|On 2 October 1967, during {{replenishment}} {{operations with}} the destroyer [...] to starboard, Buck suffered a steering casualty at 1903 that necessitated her to execute an emergency breakaway. During {{the next few}} moments, while Buck {{came into contact with}} Hassayampa, Buck’s <b>port</b> anchor was <b>pushed</b> thru its side. Upon regaining steering and a return to composure, Buck headed for Subic Bay for emergency drydock repairs that took about 30 days to accomplish.|$|R
5000|$|A cornelius keg is a {{stainless}} steel cylinder which can hold a maximum of 130 PSI. There are three openings in the keg: a large central hole which, by its design, can only be opened when the keg is not pressurized, and two ports with integral poppet valves which open when a hose with an appropriate fitting is attached to them. The central opening is used for filling and cleaning the keg, and {{is large enough to}} permit reaching inside for hand scrubbing. The two ports are used to dispense the beverage, one for [...] "gas in", and the other for [...] "liquid out". The separate metal lid for the central opening provides a clamp mechanism that closes and seals the lid against the keg with an large rubber O-ring. The lid also provides a pressure relief valve that is typically identified by a circular pull-ring (like a key ring). The relief valve can be manually opened to release the pressure in the keg; {{in the event of an}} unsafe overpressure in the keg, the relief valve automatically opens to avoid the hazard of bursting the cylinder. Two metal tubes are attached to the ports on the inside of the keg. The [...] "gas in" [...] port has a short tube, not reaching the fluid. The [...] "liquid out" [...] port has a long tube (a [...] "dip tube") which reaches to the bottom of the keg. Headspace gas pressure (usually carbon dioxide and sometimes nitrogen forced into the [...] "gas in" [...] <b>port)</b> <b>pushes</b> the drink from the bottom of the keg, up the tube, and then out of the [...] "liquid out" [...] port connected to a tap or other dispensing device.|$|R
50|$|It has {{the ability}} to eject the empty shells out of either in the right side or left side for ambidextrous operation. The bolt has seven lugs and an {{extractor}} on the left and right, with no ejector. The extractors are spring-loaded and which way cases are ejected is selected by pressing a case through a small hole located past the port. It is small and optimized for the tip of a bullet to fit. The ejection port is open on both sides and directs shells at a 45 degree angle from the barrel. The cocking lever is on the bolt carrier and can be positioned on either side by pulling it out, swinging it through the ejection <b>port,</b> and <b>pushing</b> it in to secure it in place.|$|R
5000|$|After {{refueling}} Task Group (TG) 78.6 off Biak, New Guinea, on 28 January 1945, Victoria resumed her routine fueling {{operations at}} Mios Woendi, duties she discharged through mid-April 1945. Proceeding independently for Hollandia on 19 April, Victoria reached her destination the next day, turning over cargo to the tanker [...] and taking on stores that had accumulated for the ship at that <b>port.</b> She then <b>pushed</b> on for Seeadler Harbor, which she reached on 23 April.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the ferry}} had nearly {{finished}} its voyage across the river, {{she was struck}} near {{the middle of the}} port side by the bow of the Frosta. The force of the collision drove the stem of the Frosta [...] into the side, impaling the George Prince on the <b>port</b> side and <b>pushing</b> her sideways up the river. The starboard side of the George Prince was quickly submerged, and the vessel capsized almost immediately. After capsizing, the ferry was driven under the ship, where the bottoms of the vessels collided.|$|R
5000|$|The Steyr HS [...]50 is a single-shot bolt-action rifle. It has a {{built-in}} magazine (on {{the right side of}} the gun) so each round has to be loaded directly into the ejection <b>port</b> and is <b>pushed</b> into the chamber by the bolt. The fluted barrel is cold hammer forged and provides excellent accuracy at an effective range up to 1,500 m. It has an adjustable bi-pod, a highly efficient muzzle brake which reduces recoil substantially to increase shooting comfort and a Picatinny rail for installation of various optics.|$|R
5000|$|The CZ 100 has {{a number}} of {{important}} handgun features. It is hammerless DAO (double action only), meaning that the firing system is under no tension unless the trigger is pulled. There is an automatic firing pin safety device. It is constructed for one-handed cocking, with a protrusion on the slide behind the ejection <b>port</b> intended for <b>pushing</b> against the edge of a fixed surface. The gun uses the usual Browning cam for action. There is a simple compensator on [...]40 S&W version. The tactical rail allows for the attachment of a laser or flashlight, but only proprietary models.|$|R
50|$|As {{the bullet}} {{travelled}} {{down the barrel}} after firing, it eventually passed a hole drilled {{in the bottom of}} the barrel known as a port. The hot gasses behind the bullet flow into the <b>port</b> and <b>push</b> down on a plug, marked p in the diagrams. This causes the plug to pop out of the hole with some velocity. The plug is attached to one end of a short lever, l, the other end of the lever is connected to a hinge below the barrel. The motion of the plug causes the entire lever to rotate down and to the rear, around the hinge point. This action is essentially front-to-back version of the typical back-to-front motion of a lever action rifle. The end point of this motion can be seen in the lower diagram, with the lever having traveled through an arc of about 160 degrees. A spring located at the hinge is compressed by this motion, and eventually causes the lever to rotate forward again, forcing the plug back into the port and holding it there when it is not in motion.|$|R
50|$|Departing Japanese waters on 21 September, Vella Gulf {{embarked}} 650 men at Okinawa {{for passage}} {{back to the}} west coast of the United States. After a brief stop at Pearl Harbor, she arrived at San Francisco, California, on 14 October. She subsequently operated in the Puget Sound area as training ship for escort carrier personnel until late March 1946, when she sailed for the coast of southern California and arrived at San Diego on 27 March. However, her stay there was brief, for she soon got underway again, touched at <b>Port</b> Angeles, and <b>pushed</b> on to Tacoma, where she began inactivation {{on the last day of}} the month. Moved to Seattle on 7 April, the ship was placed out of commission on 9 August 1946.|$|R
2500|$|Separating the {{expensive}} machinery section from the cargo space offers several advantages {{in comparison to}} conventional vessels, {{one of the most}} important being the ability to operate on the [...] "drop and swap" [...] principle which minimizes the turnaround time in <b>port</b> for the <b>pusher</b> and its crew. When a pusher-barge combination arrives at a port, the fully laden barge is left for unloading while the pusher picks up an empty one and leaves again. In theory the system works on optimum efficiency when there are as many barges as there are pushers and ports of call – the barges are always either being loaded or unloaded, or underway with a pusher. In addition to reducing unprofitable waiting time such operation principle allows more time for the unloading of the barge, removing the need for expensive cargo handling equipment in the unloading port.|$|R

25|$|February: The {{new manager}} {{continued}} attempting {{to strengthen the}} squad throughout February, with loan signings Albert Jarrett and Luke Medley from Lincoln and Mansfield respectively, though neither had a large impact on the team with {{only a handful of}} appearances between them. Holdsworth also signed former Shots goalkeeper Mikhael Jaimez-Ruiz, who made 62 appearances in a previous spell at the club. On the pitch, Aldershot went on a run of five consecutive draws, the first away to league leaders Chesterfield who required a later equaliser to rescue a point. An away stalemate at Morecambe was followed by consecutive home draws against Macclesfield and Lincoln. After a further draw against Northampton the Shots were finally beaten by a strong <b>Port</b> Vale side <b>pushing</b> for promotion, though the result could have been different if Anthony Charles hadn't missed a penalty. Aldershot ended the month in 18th position in the league, 8 points clear of the relegation zone.|$|R

40|$|Describes a pump {{that has}} a fixed gear axis {{eccentricity}} and varies displacement by moving controlling elements linearly along the drive shaft. A pressure compensator may be employed to displace the controlling elements. It includes a housing penetrated by a drive shaft rotating internal elements. The internal components slide along the longitudinal axis established by the drive shaft to vary the fluid displacement. The axially-moving elements include the drive shaft, inner gerotor element, port plug, thrust bearing and retainer sleeve. The drive shaft includes an internal flanged forming a piston. The outward face of the piston is in contact with fluid at system pressure. The internal gerotor element and port plug are retained against the piston by a thrust bearing that slides over the drive shaft and is {{held in place by}} a retainer sleeve. The port plug has a rear face that also functions as a piston and this face is {{the same size as the}} flanged piston. Thus, the outward piston face and rear face of the <b>port</b> plug can <b>push</b> the assembly in the housing along the longitudinal axis established by the driveshaft. A pressure compensator senses the system pressure and then displaces the axially-moving elements to produce the required displacement. The compensator is controlled by pressure operating against a return spring. The pressure compensator may either be external or integral with the pump...|$|R
