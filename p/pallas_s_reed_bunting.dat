40|$|Fifteen highly {{polymorphic}} microsatellite loci {{were characterized}} in the <b>reed</b> <b>bunting,</b> Emberiza schoeniclus. Eleven loci were autosomal and four {{linked to the}} Z chromosome. All loci were characterized and tested in 45 unrelated <b>reed</b> <b>buntings</b> from a Swiss population. Autosomal loci displayed seven to 17 and sex-linked loci displayed four to 13 alleles with heterozygosities ranging from 0. 756 to 0. 933 and from 0. 478 to 0. 957, respectively. These loci {{will be used in}} population genetic and mating system studies of <b>reed</b> <b>buntings...</b>|$|R
