50|$|The company's {{strategy}} was to partner with other companies to enable the commercialization of products. Its lead pharmaceutical products under development were biosimilar insulin and Apo AI(Milano).

2500|$|Meglitinides {{help the}} {{pancreas}} <b>produce</b> <b>insulin</b> {{and are often}} called [...] "short-acting secretagogues." [...] They act on the same potassium channels as sulfonylureas, but at a different binding site. By closing the potassium channels of the pancreatic beta cells, they open the calcium channels, thereby enhancing insulin secretion.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{occurrence}} of beta cell destruction is known, all of the processes behind it are not. Canine primary diabetes mirrors Type 1 human diabetes in the inability to <b>produce</b> <b>insulin</b> {{and the need for}} exogenous replacement of it, but the target of canine diabetes autoantibodies has yet to be identified. Breed and treatment studies have been able to provide some evidence of a genetic connection. Studies have furnished evidence that canine diabetes has a seasonal connection not unlike its human Type 1 diabetes counterpart, and a [...] "lifestyle" [...] factor, with pancreatitis being a clear cause. This evidence suggests that the disease in dogs has some environmental and dietary factors involved.|$|E
2500|$|Amongst the {{earliest}} uses of biotechnology in pharmaceutical manufacturing {{is the use}} of recombinant DNA technology to modify Escherichia coli bacteria to produce human insulin, which was performed at Genentech in 1978. [...] Prior to the development of this technique, insulin was extracted from the pancreas glands of cattle, pigs, and other farm animals. [...] While generally efficacious in the treatment of diabetes, animal-derived insulin is not indistinguishable from human insulin, and may therefore produce allergic reactions. Genentech researchers produced artificial genes for each of the two protein chains that comprise the insulin molecule. [...] The artificial genes were [...] "then inserted... into plasmids... among a group of genes that" [...] are activated by lactose. [...] Thus, the insulin-producing genes were also activated by lactose. [...] The recombinant plasmids were inserted into Escherichia coli bacteria, which were [...] "induced to produce 100,000 molecules of either chain A or chain B human insulin." [...] The two protein chains were then combined to <b>produce</b> <b>insulin</b> molecules.|$|E
50|$|Recombinant {{human insulin}} : Almost {{completely}} replaced insulin obtained from animal sources (e.g. pigs and cattle) {{for the treatment}} of insulin-dependent diabetes. A variety of different recombinant insulin preparations are in widespread use. Recombinant insulin is synthesized by inserting the human insulin gene into E. coli, or yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) which then <b>produces</b> <b>insulin</b> for human use.|$|R
50|$|Sertoli {{cells were}} also {{exploited}} in experiments for their immunosuppressive function. They {{were used to}} protect and nurture islets <b>producing</b> <b>insulin</b> to treat type I diabetes. The exploitation of Sertoli cells significantly increased the survival of transplanted islets. However, more experiments must be conducted before this method may be tested in human medicine as part of clinical trials.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, Escherichia coli is {{the choice}} {{bacterium}} to express eukaryotic and recombinant genes. E. coli is well understood and has a successful track record <b>producing</b> <b>insulin,</b> the artemisinin precursor artemisinic acid, and filgrastim (Neupogen). However, use of E. coli has limitations including misfolding of eukaryotic proteins, insolubility issues, deposition in inclusion bodies, low secretion efficiency, secretion to periplasmic space.|$|R
2500|$|Early {{diagnosis}} and interventive treatment can mean reduced incidence of complications such as cataracts and neuropathy. Since dogs are insulin dependent, oral drugs are not effective for them. They {{must be placed}} on insulin replacement therapy. Approved oral diabetes drugs can be helpful to sufferers of Type 2 diabetes because they work {{in one of three}} ways: by inducing the pancreas to produce more insulin, by allowing the body to more effectively use the insulin it produces, or by slowing the glucose absorption rate from the GI tract. Unapproved so-called [...] "natural" [...] remedies make similar claims for their products. All of this is based on the premise of having an endocrine pancreas with beta cells capable of producing insulin. Those with Type 1, or insulin-dependent diabetes, have beta cells which are permanently damaged, thus unable to <b>produce</b> <b>insulin.</b> This is the reason nothing other than insulin replacement therapy can be considered real and effective treatment. Canine diabetes means insulin dependency; insulin therapy must be continued for life.|$|E
