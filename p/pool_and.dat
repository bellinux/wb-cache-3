40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{size and}} shape {{characteristics}} of the surface bed sediments in a sequence of four <b>pools</b> <b>and</b> four fifties were investigated in a small cobble-bed stream. The riffle sediments are both coarser and better sorted than the pool sediments. These differences are {{explained in terms of}} reversal of the bottom velocity/shear stress hi-erarchy between <b>pools</b> <b>and</b> fifties at high flow. Riffle sediments are also less spherical than pool sediments, but the differences in shape are entirely size-dependent. Thus it appears that sorting occurs by size, but not by shape, as sediments are deposited in <b>pools</b> <b>and</b> fifties...|$|R
