5000|$|In 1975, the {{scientific}} research laboratory of the Research Institute of Oceanology of PSU Sevmorgeo completed {{the project to}} improve the prototype of hydro-slotting <b>perforation</b> <b>tool</b> and this tool {{has been able to}} operate independently of the tubing movement. The equipment was 16 ft long, 4.02 in OD, weight 300 lb and stroke length of 0.5 ft only, and it worked on the following principle: the energy of working fluid pressure was divided into two components. Part of energy was used for the motion creation for the working rod with the perforator and nozzles; {{the other part of the}} energy was use for the cutting process (creating the continued slots along the wellbore through the casing and cement into the productive formation). The form and depth of the slots allowed the device to perform its main task, unloading the annular stress conditions and increase the permeability. The first practical tests in the wells were successfully made at the end of 1975 on [...] "Archeda" [...] field (Volgograd, Russia).|$|E
5000|$|During {{the period}} from {{the date of the}} first {{prototype}} of hydro-slotting <b>perforation</b> <b>tool</b> to present day, the type and technological characteristics of the equipment was significantly improved. The modern underground hydro-slotting equipment represents the devices, capable to instantly cut through the steel casing, through the cement to delve into the productive formation and keep the jets in this state while moving along the borehole, keeping the same depth of cut. Hydro-slotting equipment made of special high-strength materials, 12 ft long, 3.5 ft OD, weight 180 lb, cutting speed from the point of perforation to 0.7 in per minute, working stroke length 1.65 ft (4.92 ft x 1.64 ft x 1.97 in each slot), depth of slots five feet, continued and geometrically correct slots, opening area 63 sq ft per cut with four nozzles, can apply streamlined perforators between two and six nozzles, unloading the annular stress conditions in the near wellbore zone 50 to 100 percent, and increase the permeability 30 to 50 percent. The continuous time without lifting to the surface is 11-15 hours (nozzles lifespan ~ 15 hours, perforator ~ seven wells, hydraulic engine ~ 40 wells).|$|E
50|$|Rotary pinned {{perforation}} rollers are precision {{tools that}} can be used to perforate a wide variety of materials. The pins or needles can be used cold or heated. Cold <b>perforation</b> <b>tools</b> include needle punches.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a handful}} of {{manufacturers}} that specialize in hot and cold needle <b>perforation</b> <b>tooling</b> and equipment. In materials that have elasticity this can result in a [...] "volcano" [...] hole that is preferred in many applications.|$|R
50|$|Using a {{standard}} well servicing rig, the PPT would be lowered to a location above the well <b>perforations.</b> The <b>tool</b> {{would then be}} raised up eight meters and dropped. This was done between 200-550 times over eight to 12 hours.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Drilling <b>perforations</b> and <b>tool</b> wear {{are intimately}} and {{mutually}} connected by fracture prop-agations at different size-scales. To study this interaction phenomenon, we propose {{an ad hoc}} devel-oped fractal coupled theory. Describing the two processes in terms of drilling and wear velocities, the theory is able to predict the relation between these two quantities. The result is represented by a power law between wear and drilling velocities with exponent comprised between 2 / 3 and 3 / 2. Some experimental tests on different materials like mortar, concrete and reinforced concrete have also been performed. Theoretical predictions and experimental results agree satisfactorily...|$|R
40|$|Gas Technology Institute (GTI) {{has been}} the leading {{investigator}} {{in the field of}} high power laser applications research for well construction and completion applications. Since 1997, GTI (then as Gas Research Institute) has investigated several military and industrial laser systems and their ability to cut and drill into reservoir type rocks. In this report, GTI continues its investigation with a recently acquired 5. 34 kW ytterbium-doped multi-clad high power fiber laser (HPFL). The HPFL represents a potentially disruptive technology that, when compared to its competitors, is more cost effective to operate, capable of remote operations, and requires considerably less maintenance and repair. To determine how this promising laser would perform under high pressure in-situ conditions, GTI performed a number of experiments with results directly comparable to previous data. Experiments were designed to investigate the effect of laser input parameters on representative reservoir rock types of sandstone and limestone. The focus of the experiments was on completion and perforation applications, although the results and techniques apply to well construction and other rock cutting applications. All previous laser/rock interaction tests were performed on samples in the lab at atmospheric pressure. To determine the effect of downhole pressure conditions, a sophisticated tri-axial cell was designed and tested. For the first time, Berea sandstone, limestone and clad core samples were lased under various combinations of confining, axial and pore pressures. Composite core samples consisted of steel cemented to rock in an effort to represent material penetrated in a cased hole. The results of this experiment will assist {{in the development of a}} downhole laser <b>perforation</b> prototype <b>tool.</b> In the past, several combinations of laser and rock variables were investigated at standard conditions and reported in the literature. More recent experiments determined the technical feasibility of laser perforation on multiple samples of rock, cement and steel. The fiber laser was capable of penetrating these materials under a variety of conditions, to an appropriate depth, and with reasonable energy requirements. It was determined that fiber lasers are capable of cutting rock without causing damage to flow properties. Furthermore, the laser perforation resulted in permeability improvements on the exposed rock surface. This report discusses the design and development of a customized laser pressure cell; experimental design and procedures, and the resulting data on pressure-charged samples exposed to the laser beam. An analysis provides the resulting effect of downhole pressure conditions on the laser/rock interaction process...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the results and}} findings of an investigation of stone bead production at el-Hemmeh, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) site in Jordan. The PPNA in the Near East is uniquely characterized by the invention of agriculture and a transition to a sedentary lifestyle, and has therefore {{been the focus of}} much research in the region. El-Hemmeh uniquely exhibits multiple phases of occupation during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and again during the Late Pre-Pottery neolithic B, and so presents an opportunity to track changes over time at a single site and to highlight aspects of technological style in the PPNA. Stone beads and raw stone material from both the PPNA and LPPNB at el-Hemmeh are analyzed in this thesis. Patterns of typology, color and material are systematically explored, and manufacturing methods are reconstructed based on the close examination of <b>perforations,</b> polishing, and <b>tool</b> marks on ten PPNA beads carefully selected as case studies. The typology of PPN stone beads at el-Hemmeh falls into place with a regional range of shapes and sizes, although I propose here the establishment of a distinct category of rectangular beads. These rectangular beads may have one or two perforations, are only found in the PPNA, only made of greenstone, and may have a distinct cultural significance. Selection of raw material seems motivated primarily by color considerations, and color in the LPPNB sees a shift from green to red. Stone bead production at el-Hemmeh is one characterized by local production influenced by a regional style and motivated by social and cultural developments. by Danielle Raad. Thesis: S.
