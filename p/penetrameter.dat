40|$|Continuous {{carbon fiber}} {{reinforced}} aluminum matrix composite materials (Cf/Al) contains manufacturing abnormalities such as shrinkage void, shrinkage porosity and delamination. Fundamental {{characteristics of the}} defects in Cf/Al were investigated through the correlation of radiographic image and microstructure of the composites. Hole-style <b>penetrameter</b> was designed and manufactured to help quantify the size of voids. The results showed that X-ray radiography is effective to quantify the shrinkage void and shrinkage porosity in Cf/Al. The sensitivity of Cf/Al radiographic investigation can be enhanced {{under the control of}} hole-style <b>penetrameter.</b> Keywords:X-ray radiography, Cf/Al composite, defect analysis, sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Radiography is {{frequently}} {{used to detect}} discontinuities in welded joints (porosity, cracks, lack of penetration). Perfect knowledge of the geometry of these defects {{is an important step}} which is essential to appreciate the quality of the weld. Because of this, an action improving the interpretation of radiographs by image processing has been undertaken. The principle consists in making a radiograph of the welded joint and of a depth step wedge <b>penetrameter</b> in the material. The radiograph is then finely digitized and an automatic processing of the radiograph of the <b>penetrameter</b> image allows the establishment of a correspondence between grey levels and material thickness. An algorithm based on image processing is used to localize defects in the welded joints and to isolate them from the original image. First, defects detected by this method are characterized in terms of dimension and equivalent thickness. Then, from the image of the healthy welded joint (that is to say without the detected defects), characteristic values of the weld are evaluated (thickness reduction, width). INTRODUCTION- PRINCIPLE OF THE STUDY Research for smallest flaws and for perfect knowledge of welded joints is an important step in the improvement of non-destructive controls. In some specifi...|$|E
40|$|The {{resolution}} {{of a film}} or film — screen combination is essential for characterizing the radiographic system. The conventional methods for measuring the resolution in radiography, based on the Image Quality Indicators (IQI) and <b>Penetrameters,</b> are not applicable for high energy radiation (in the MV range) due to the high penetration. In addition, the IQI and <b>Penetrameters</b> do not measure only the spatial resolution but rather an undefined combination of the spatial and thickness resolution. Another approach used for analyzing the film resolution {{is based on the}} measurement of the radiographic response to a step function input...|$|R
40|$|Materials used in coal-conversion {{systems are}} exposed to high pressure, high temperature, {{corrosive}} and erosive gases, and liquids containing particulate matter. These severe environments necessitate {{an assessment of the}} integrity of components to prevent premature failures. Gamma radiography was evaluated as a viable technique for testing such components in the laboratory or after operation in situ. <b>Penetrameters</b> (image-quality indicators) were developed for refractory-lined vessels and transfer lines, and exposure times for various combinations of refractory-steel thicknesses were determined. Radiography with /sup 60 /Co was performed on gasifier vessels, combustor vessels, and critical transfer lines in existing pilot plants using the experience gained through laboratory experiments. The results show that gamma radiography is a practical and effective method to detect critical conditions in coal-conversion system components...|$|R
40|$|This {{process is}} {{designed}} to estimate the thickness change of a material through data analysis of a digitized version of an x-ray (or a digital x-ray) containing the material (with the thickness in question) and various tooling. Using this process, {{it is possible to}} estimate a material's thickness change in a region of the material or part that is thinner {{than the rest of the}} reference thickness. However, that same principle process can be used to determine the thickness change of material using a thinner region to determine thickening, or it can be used to develop contour plots of an entire part. Proper tooling must be used. An x-ray film with an S-shaped characteristic curve or a digital x-ray device with a product resulting in like characteristics is necessary. If a film exists with linear characteristics, this type of film would be ideal; however, at the time of this reporting, no such film has been known. Machined components (with known fractional thicknesses) of a like material (similar density) to that of the material to be measured are necessary. The machined components should have machined through-holes. For ease of use and better accuracy, the throughholes should be a size larger than 0. 125 in. (. 3 mm). Standard components for this use are known as <b>penetrameters</b> or image quality indicators. Also needed is standard x-ray equipment, if film is used in place of digital equipment, or x-ray digitization equipment with proven conversion properties. Typical x-ray digitization equipment is commonly used in the medical industry, and creates digital images of x-rays in DICOM format. It is recommended to scan the image in a 16 -bit format. However, 12 -bit and 8 -bit resolutions are acceptable. Finally, x-ray analysis software that allows accurate digital image density calculations, such as Image-J freeware, is needed. The actual procedure requires the test article to be placed on the raw x-ray, ensuring the region of interest is aligned for perpendicular x-ray exposure capture. One or multiple machined components of like material/ density with known thicknesses are placed atop the part (preferably in a region of nominal and non-varying thickness) such that exposure of the combined part and machined component lay-up is captured on the x-ray. Depending on the accuracy required, the machined component fs thickness must be carefully chosen. Similarly, depending on the accuracy required, the lay-up must be exposed such that the regions of the x-ray to be analyzed have a density range between 1 and 4. 5. After the exposure, the image is digitized, and the digital image can then be analyzed using the image analysis software...|$|R
40|$|The {{contrast}} {{sensitivity of the}} radiographic amplifiers, both the storage type and nonstorage type, their absolute sensitivity, and the reproducibility of fabrication were investigated. The required 2 - 2 T quality level was reached with the radiographic storage screen. The sensitivity threshold was 100 to 200 mR with 45 to 100 kV filtered X-rays. The quality level of the radiographic amplifier screen (without storage) was 4 - 4 T; for a 6 mm (0. 25 in.) thick aluminum specimen, a 1 mm (0. 040 in.) diameter hole in a 0. 25 mm (0. 010 in.) thick <b>penetrameter</b> was detected. Its sensitivity threshold was 2 to 6 mR/min. The developed radiographic screens are applicable for uses in nondestructive testing...|$|E
40|$|Welded joints are an {{essential}} part of pressure vessels such as the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) Turbopumps. Defects produced in the welding process can be detrimental to weld performance. Recently, review of the SSME high pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP) titanium inlet x rays revealed several weld discrepancies such as <b>penetrameter</b> density issues, film processing discrepancies, weld width discrepancies, porosity, lack of fusion, and weld offsets. Currently, the sensitivity of welded structures to defects is of concern. From a fatigue standpoint, weld offset may have a serious effect since local yielding, in general, aggravates cyclic stress effects. Therefore, the weld offset issue is considered. Using the finite element method and mathematical formulations, parametric studies were conducted to determine the influence of weld offsets and a variation of weld widths in longitudinally welded cylindrical structures with equal wall thickness {{on both sides of the}} joint. From the study, the finite element results and theoretical solutions are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{visibility}} of flaws and image quality indicators (IQI) by human operators is discussed for comparison of film radiography (RT-F) to digital radiography (RT-D). Many parameters influence {{the sensitivity of}} digital radiographs, but only three are essential for the achievable contrast sensitivity. These essential parameters are the basic spatial resolution (SRb image), the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the specific contrast (µeff). The equivalent <b>penetrameter</b> sensitivity (EPS), which corresponds to the contrast sensitivity of plate hole IQIs as defined by ASTM E 1025, can be calculated, if the essential parameters are known. The related studies were performed with Computed Radiography (CR) and Digital Detector Arrays (DDA) in comparison to digitized film radiographs. Radiography with DDAs can achieve typically much better IQI visibility than RT-F and CR, even at short exposure time. The results of measurements are presented and recommendations for exposure conditions are concluded for a standard practice. Compensation principles are derived from the three essential parameters...|$|E
40|$|Unsharpness in {{the image}} may reduce the {{visibility}} of details. Magnification is often required to achieve a spatial resolution similar to film technique, when using digital systems. A part of the unsharpness results from the focal spot size. To determine the effective focal spot size, thousands of images with different tubes, energies, magnifications and IQIs from different EN and ASTM standards were taken to evaluate {{the influence of the}} unsharpness in the digital image due to the focal spot. This leads to reference values for the effective focal spot size of the different tubes. These reference values were compared with the values of the pin hole camera images according to EN 12543 - 2 and they deviated significantly. Several modifications of the evaluation method were proposed and a method with Integrated Line Profiles which produces results like an edge profile method was developed and tested providing similar results as the reference values. A second more simple method for end-users was introduced based on the evaluation of <b>Penetrameter</b> hole edges. A proposed update of the standards for focal spot measurements in ASTM and ISO is introduced. New classes will help the users to identify more simple and reliable the X-ray tube for their application...|$|E
40|$|Non disponibleThis text briefly {{comments}} {{the geological}} history, mineralogy, stratigraphy and sedimentation of mudstones and marls from the Keuper Marl {{series of the}} eastern part of France. Geotechnical studies in England and also in France point out particular problems related to the overconsolidated structure of this material of Triassic age. A vide scatter in observed in the test results between the high values of strength of the unweathered soils and the low values of the softened zones. No simple relation to depth can be estahlished. A classification modified from the scheme proposed by the British research workers, shows that index properties and clay-sized proportion change with the alteration zones, as a result of silt-sized aggregation of clay minerals. Simple unexpensive tests allow quick quantitative evaluation of the unweathered material. Point load test and direct shear test on preformed failure planes give a measure of cohesion and ultimate friction angle. Short term weathering of marls appears closely related to the degree of saturation of the specimen before rewetting. One-dimensional and three-dimensional compression tests of intact and remoulded states are compared and the computed values of permeability from those tests are discussed. Rates of secondary compression are related of the alteration zones and overconsolidation ratio. Theoretical and experimental evidences lead the author to develop a graphical method of obtaining the strength parameters from stress paths in a three-dimensional (shear stress, normal stress, water content) space. Most of the scatter resulting from various swells during alteration, sampling and testing, is thus taken into account. The shape or the undrained compression stress paths correlates with the elastic parameters measured. Hvorslev strength components or Keuper clays and marls are compared with published data for other soils. Measurements of strength parameters by the static cone <b>penetrameter</b> in the weathered profile over Keuper Marl, are evaluated and compared with results obtained on a small-scale laboratory apparatus. The system was designed with a confinement cell (15 x 15 cm) which permitted to simulate the overburden pressure, up to 4 kg/sq cm. Finally, a regional study of 440 natural slopes shows a slight correlation with geology and index properties. Equilibrium conditions of natural slopes seem to be closer to the "critical state" strength envelope than to the residual angle...|$|E
