5|$|FSB 30 {{lasted only}} about one week longer. Although the {{steepness}} of the hill on which the base was situated precluded armored attack, the PAVN artillery bombardment was very effective. By 3 March the base's six 105mm and six 155mm howitzers had been <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action. In an attempt to relieve the firebase, ARVN armor and infantry of the 17th Cavalry moved out to save their comrades.|$|E
5|$|On the 16th RCT front, at {{the eastern}} end of Easy Red, was another area between strongpoints. This allowed G/16 and the support {{battalion}} to escape complete destruction in their advance up the beach. Nevertheless, most of G/16's 63 casualties for the day came before they had reached the shingle. The other 2nd Battalion company landed in the second wave; H/16 came in a few hundred yards to the left, opposite the E-3 draw, and suffered for it – they were <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action for several hours.|$|E
5|$|On their right, the 1/10th Battalion, London Regiment (161st Brigade) {{finished}} capturing and consolidating the Rafa redoubt, {{which had}} only been partly captured by the 1/6th Battalion, The Essex Regiment. Without the assistance of tanks which had been <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action, this battalion lost contact with the barrage and suffered heavy losses. Nevertheless, they captured Gun Hill and by 06:00 on 2 November they were preparing to attack Sheikh Hasan, which they captured fifteen minutes later along with 182 prisoners.|$|E

As a result, Orton punted DiBiase in the head, putting him out of action; this storyline {{was put in place}} in order for DiBiase to take time off to film The Marine 2.

5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
5|$|For their efforts, 9 Staffel {{destroyed}} {{at least}} three hangars, hit several other buildings and destroyed eight Hurricanes on the ground. According to other sources, 10 hangars were destroyed, six damaged, the operations room <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action, and many buildings were destroyed. It would have been worse had the bombs been released higher. A lot of bombs landed horizontally and did not explode on impact. To achieve this level of damage, KG 76 dropped nine tons of bombs. At {{the end of the}} day just one hangar was left operational at Kenley. The low-level raid put the airfield out of commission for two hours. In combat, two Hurricanes were shot down by the Dorniers' return fire. In return 9 Staffel lost four Do 17s, three slightly damaged and two seriously damaged. Low-level attacks were abandoned after The Hardest Day.|$|E

Unfortunately for Cochet in the fifth set they were serving for the match and had thirty-love in the game, when Brugnon missed an easy ball when three match points were at stake. Lacoste and Borotra revived {{from that moment on}} and closed out the final set 8–6. In singles he was <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the contest by Borotra in the semifinals and thus was unable to retain his title. However, Cochet did not leave without a trophy as the mixed championship was earned by him and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall.|$|E

It was too close to the coast {{to be used as a}} squadron base, but squadrons were detached there on a day-to-day basis.

Malini soon becomes very {{successful}} and popular. She is later befriended by Sampath, a charlatan, who is regularly involved in dodging creditors. Deaf to all advice, Malini allows herself to be led astray in professional, financial and moral terms. She is <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Kala Mandhiram and sets up a theatre company of her own where Sampath appoints himself as general manager. She also severs ties with those who previously helped her, including Sundari. At first, the new company prospers, but its resources are soon squandered by Sampath and it falls under a weight of debt and disgrace. Sampath abandons Malini, who falls back to her previous poor condition. However, with Sundari's help, she returns to Kala Mandhiram and begins her life anew.|$|E

Skilfully using chaff to confuse the Allied radar operators, they found the port packed with brightly lit Allied shipping. The result was the most {{destructive}} air raid on Allied shipping since the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Hits were scored on two ammunition ships and a tanker. Burning oil and exploding ammunition spread over the harbour. Some 16 ships were sunk and eight damaged, and the port was <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action for three weeks.

She bombarded the rebellious {{garrison}} of Fort Krasnaya Gorka in 1919 and supported Bolshevik light forces operating against British ships supporting the White Russians in the Gulf of Finland. On 17 August 1919 Petropavlovsk was claimed as torpedoed and <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action by the British Coastal Motor Boat CMB 88 in Kronstadt harbor, but was, in fact, not damaged at all. On 24 November 1919 a fire broke out in Poltavas forward boiler room and gutted much of her interior; she was never repaired although numerous proposals were made to reconstruct her. The crews of Sevastopol and Petropavlovsk joined the Kronstadt Rebellion of 1921 and they were renamed Parizhskaya Kommuna and Marat respectively after the rebellion was crushed to commemorate the Paris Commune and to erase their 'betrayal' of the Communist Party. The two undamaged ships were recommissioned in 1925–26 and all the ships were given proper revolutionary names.|$|E

In {{fear that}} Italy might be <b>put</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the war, the French and British Governments each promised to send six {{divisions}} to the Italian Front.
