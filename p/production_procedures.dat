40|$|The <b>production</b> <b>procedure</b> of low fat cheeses {{produced}} from ultrafiltered milk (UF cheese) {{was developed in}} this study. The <b>production</b> <b>procedure,</b> that includes utilization of UF milk with 2 % of lactose, addition of 1. 5 % inulin and salting with 2 % of mixed salt (NaCl/KCl in ratio 3 : 1) was defined based on the investigation that included the influence of coagulation parameters, different lactose content of UF milk, different inulin content, and different salt type and content on the properties of low fat UF cheeses. Presented <b>production</b> <b>procedure</b> enables the <b>production</b> of a product with satisfactory dietetic and functional properties. Reduced lactose content of UF milk contributes to stabilisation of pH value at an adequate level and achievement of acceptable texture properties of low fat UF cheeses. Defined inulin content (1. 5 %) improved cheese texture, {{as well as its}} functional properties, enabling the cheese produced to be marked as a “good source of fibre”. Reduced sodium content, due to partial substitution of NaCl with KCl, also contributes to the improvement of dietetic properties of cheeses. Low fat UF cheeses, produced according to defined <b>production</b> <b>procedure,</b> were analysed during 8 weeks of ripening and storage periods. Composition, pH values and proteolytic pattern were typical for brined cheeses. Uniform microstructure and acceptable sensory properties, especially the texture, confirm the validity of the developed <b>production</b> <b>procedure</b> of low fat UF cheeses from UF milk...|$|R

After the global acceptance of renowned theatre director Peter Brook, many theatre directors went after behind Asian traditional theatre art forms and other Asian representational systems to develop and portray the theatre presentations utilizing or somehow capitalizing the actor training systems and scenic representations from the particular Asian theatres such as Noh theatre, Kathakali, Chinese opera etc. While Peter Brook was succeeded in his approach of universally accepted vision of theatre making through the Asian theatre systems beyond the parameters of imitating different theatrical topics, many other recent institutions or directorial approaches are tightened within the parameters of imitations or comparisons or just exchanges of physical exercises.|$|E
5000|$|To {{overcome}} the durability problem, durable good manufacturers must persuade consumers to replace functioning products with new ones or {{to pay them}} money in other ways. Replacement of functioning goods refers to business strategies that persuade or force consumers to purchase new products. One category of strategies is contrived durability that refers to product design that intentionally shortens the product lifetime before it is released onto the market. In most instances, durability is built into a product by the manufacturer through its choices of inputs and <b>production</b> <b>procedures.</b> Another category of strategies refers is planned obsolescence that refers to shortening the lifetime of a product after it is released onto the market. Under this strategy, the manufacturer “convinces” the consumer to replace an old product with a new one, thereby rendering the lifetime of the old product shorter than its actual useful lifetime. Annual style changes of cars and revised editions of textbooks are prime examples of planned obsolescence. Although contrived durability and planned obsolescence are different in many ways, they are often confused, which is not surprising considering the article on planned obsolescence defines planned obsolescence as a [...] "policy of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life", which would be prior {{to the release of}} said product barring the existence of a time warp machine.|$|E
