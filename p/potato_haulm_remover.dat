40|$|A site {{specific}} herbicide {{dosing system}} for <b>potato</b> <b>haulm</b> killing using Reglone (diquatdibromide 200 g. l- 1 Syngenta Crop protection BV) was tested in 2005 on two commercial ware potato fields in Lelystad, NL. The system {{consisted of a}} Yara N-sensor {{on the roof of}} the tractor, a 24 m Hardi Twin Force sprayer with a Raven pesticide injection system, and a controler unit (PDA, DSS and GPS) that translated reflection measurements into a minimum effective dose. The DSS in the control unit was based on studies in previous years. It is called MLHD <b>potato</b> <b>haulm</b> killing...|$|R
40|$|When using variable-rate {{application}} (VRA), tractor-mounted sensors {{are typically}} {{used to measure}} crop status. Crop status can also be measured with a satellite-based sensor. In both cases a vegetation index derived from the sensor measurements is used {{as an indicator of}} the amount of crop biomass. The first objective {{of this study was to}} establish a relationship between the Weighted Difference Vegetation Index (WDVI) in potato as measured with a nearby, ground-based crop reflectance meter on the one hand and WDVI as measured with remote, satellite-based sensors on the other hand. It was found that groundbased WDVI and satellite-based WDVI are strongly and linearly related, thus making it feasible to calculate herbicide rates for <b>potato</b> <b>haulm</b> killing on the basis of satellite-based measurements. The scale at which VRA is applied is an important determinant of the reduction in input use. The second objective was to estimate the potential to reduce herbicide use for <b>potato</b> <b>haulm</b> killing as a function of the size of decision units, using the above-mentioned relationship, satellite imagery of 13 potato fields and a previously developed decision rule for herbicide rate. It was found that when the size of the decision unit was 15 m × 15 m (the size of an ASTER pixel), a reduction in herbicide use of at least 50 % would be achieved in one out of every two of the fields, and a reduction of at least 33 % would be achieved in all fields. When the size of the decision unit was 30 m × 30 m, a reduction of at least 33 % would be achieved in one out of every two of the fields. In conclusion, satellite-based crop reflectance measurements can be used instead of ground-based measurements for determining herbicide rate for <b>potato</b> <b>haulm</b> killing. When the size of the decision unit is not larger than 30 m × 30 m, a 50 % reduction in herbicide use for <b>potato</b> <b>haulm</b> killing can be achieved with VR...|$|R

40|$|A Serratia plymuthica-specific TaqMan® assay was {{designed}} {{based on the}} consensus nucleotide sequence from the 3 '- end of the luxS gene present in all S. plymuthica strains tested. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by testing 21 Serratia spp. strains and 30 isolates belonging to various species that can potentially coexist with S. plymuthica in the same environment. Positive reactions in the TaqMan® assay were observed only for S. plymuthica isolates and not for other bacteria. The TaqMan® assay could detect down to 1. 95 ng of S. plymuthica DNA, down to 5 bacterial cells per reaction (100 cfu ml- 1) in vitro, down to 50 bacterial cells per reaction (1, 000 cfu ml- 1) in spiked potato root extracts and down to 5 bacterial cells per reaction (100 cfu ml- 1) in spiked <b>potato</b> <b>haulm</b> extracts. We used this assay to quantify S. plymuthica A 30 cells in <b>potato</b> and tomato <b>haulms</b> and roots grown from S. plymuthica A 30 -inoculated potato seed tubers and tomato seeds. The results were comparable with the spread-plating of plant extracts on a newly developed S. plymuthica A 30 selective medium (CVTR 2 Arif).

40|$|A {{procedure}} for the quantification of microsclerotia ofVerticillium dahliae {{with an image}} analysis system was compared with counting by eye. Colonised potato plant material was used from plants grown in pathogen-free soil in a greenhouse and from twelve crops (including four potato cultivars) grown outdoors in pots filled with pathogen-free soil under natural conditions. The values obtained from the potato material from the greenhouse were comparable for both methods. Variation in the results mainly resulted from sampling errors. The numbers of microsclerotia in plants grown outdoors were overestimated by image analysis for most crops. The source of the error {{was related to the}} presence of plant and soil particles that did not discolour during boiling of the samples in sodium hydroxide. Image analysis was a suitable and reliable method for assessing the number of microsclerotia only in <b>potato</b> <b>haulm</b> samples from plants grown in pathogen-free soil in the greenhouse...|$|R
60|$|Geoffrey asked no questions, but ran at {{full speed}} through the camp, {{shouting}} orders as he went, and presently stood breathless upon a tall bank of raw red earth. On one side the green-stained river went frothing past; on the other a muddy flood spouted through a breach, and already a shallow lake was spreading fast across the cleared land, licking up long rows of <b>potato</b> <b>haulm</b> and timothy grass. Men swarmed like bees about the sloping side of the bank, hurling down earth and shingle into the aperture, but a few moments' inspection convinced Geoffrey that more heroic measures were needed and that they labored in vain. Raising his hand, he called to the men to stop work and, when the clatter of shovels ceased, he quietly surveyed the few poor fields rancher Hudson had won from the swamp. His lips were pressed tight together, and his expression showed his deep concern.|$|R
40|$|This review mainly {{discusses}} flaming with LPG (liquefied petroleum gas), {{used primarily}} in horticultural crops. A brief survey is made also of other thermal weed control methods, for example: with infra-red radiation, using steam, microwaves, electrical treatment using high voltage current with continous contact or spark discharges. The biological effects of flaming on plants, weed seeds and soil are described. Technique {{and type of}} equipment in use are discussed, and also methods and economical aspects of its use in vegetable crops, root crops, fruit crops, on hard surfaces in urban areas, and for <b>potato</b> <b>haulm</b> desiccation. Other possible applications such as using flaming for soil sterilisation, to control plant diseases and crop pests are discussed briefly. Thermal weed control by flaming is today used commercially mainly by alternative vegetable growers and on hard surfaces in urban areas. Flaming is generally more expensive than chemical weed control. Flaming is an important and profitable aid primarily when one wishes or is compelled {{to cut down on}} the use of herbicides and the alternative is handweeding...|$|R

Susan brought little George down with her, and off the party set. Sam and Hal, who had been waiting in the hall, took Miss Fosbrook between them, as if they thought it their duty to do the honours of the bonfire, and conducted her across the garden, through the kitchen-garden, across which lay a long sluggish bar of heavy and very odorous smoke, to a gate in a quickset hedge. Here were some sheds and cart-houses, a fagot pile, various logs of timber, a grindstone, and--that towards which all the eight children rushed with whoops of ecstasy--a heap of smoking rubbish, chiefly dry leaves, and peas and <b>potato</b> <b>haulm,</b> with a large allowance of cabbage stumps--all extremely earthy, and looking as if the smouldering smoke were a wonder from so mere a heap of dirt.|$|R
40|$|When {{spraying}} {{plant protection products}} (PPP) the used amount per spraying is generally based on a pre set dose. Most often fields with variations in crop development are treated uniformly while spraying some patches in these fields would have been sufficient. In {{order to deal with}} the variations in crop development and site-specific variations in a field, a sensor-based spray technology was developed; SensiSpray. The system consists of sensors to detect crop variation and a spray system to automatically change spray volume. Electronics and software were developed to use the output signal of the sensor NTech GreenSeeker to adapt spray volume. For the variation of spray volume (50 - 550 L ha- 1) Lechler VarioSelect nozzle bodies were used fitted with four different low-drift venturi flat fan nozzles. Spray deposition measurements were performed to test the sprayer accuracy in adapting spray volume based on the reflection signal per section, using a fluorescent dye (Brilliant Sulpho Flavine) added to the spray liquid. By moving diagonally over stripes of grassland, varying in greenness, longitudinal accuracy and lateral variation in spray deposition was quantified. The system showed to be able to adapt spray volume within 1 - 2 m in the direction travelled. In the 2007 - 2009 seasons different potato fields were sprayed and a general use reduction in PPP for <b>potato</b> <b>haulm</b> killing was c. 50 %, maintaining efficacy...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of Biological Soil Disinfestation (BSD) to control potato brown rot, caused by Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2, was investigated. BSD involves the induction of anaerobic soil conditions by increasing microbial respiration through incorporation of fresh organic amendments (here: grass or <b>potato</b> <b>haulms)</b> and by reducing re-supply of oxygen by covering with airtight plastic sheets. Control treatments were left without cover and amendment, or amended without covering or covered only without amendment. The effect of BSD on survival of R. solanacearum was tested at three different scales: in 1 -l glass mesocosms under laboratory conditions, in 1. 2 -m-diam microplots positioned in an outdoor quarantine field, {{and in a}} naturally infested commercial field. Within a few days, anaerobic conditions developed in the BSD-treated soils. In the mesocosm and microplot experiment, anaerobic conditions persisted {{till the end of}} the 4 -week experimental period. In the field experiment, the period of anaerobiosis was shorter due to birds damaging the plastic cover. In all three experiments, BSD reduced soil populations of R. solanacearum significantly by 92. 5 % to > 99. 9 % compared to the non-amended and uncovered control treatments. In the field experiment, BSD also resulted in a significant reduction of R. solanacearum survival in potato tubers buried at 15 or 35 cm and in the rapid decomposition of superficially buried potatoes remaining after harvesting, thus destroying an important inoculum reservoir of R. solanacearum. The treatments with grass amendment only or covering with only plastic did not result in anaerobic conditions and did not decrease R. solanacearum populations during the experimental period. PCR-DGGE analyses of 16 S-rDNA from soil samples of the various treatments in the mesocosm and microplot experiments revealed that BSD hardly affected bacterial diversity but did result in clear shifts in the composition of the bacterial community. The possible implications of these shifts are discussed. It is concluded that BSD has the potential to strongly decrease soil infestation levels of R. solanacearum and to become an important element in a sustainable and effective management strategy for potato brown rot, especially in areas where the disease is endemic...|$|R
40|$|Potato brown rot, {{caused by}} Ralstonia solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 (Phylovar II, sequevar 1), {{is a serious}} endemic disease in the Nile Delta of Egypt. It is a {{quarantine}} disease in the EU, and export of potatoes from Egypt is restricted to pest-free areas in the desert. This thesis is directed at survival and eradication of the pathogen in areas that may become contaminated and at brown rot control in infested areas. R. solanacearum survival and disease suppression were studied for soils differing in origin (Dutch versus Egyptian soils), type (san d versus clay), and management (organic versus conventional). Effects of amendment of conventional soils with NPK and organic soils with compost or cow manure were compared with non-amended controls. The pathogen survived longer in Dutch than in Egyptian soils, and in clay than in san dy soils from both countries. Survival was never longer than 180 days {{and in many cases}} much shorter, especially in Egyptian san dy soil. Organic management reduced pathogen survival in Egyptian soils, especially in the san dy soil, but not in Dutch soils. Pathogen survival was positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil, negatively with organic matter (OM) content at similar DOC content, and negatively with bacterial diversity estimated from denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of eubacterial 16 S rDNA extracted from soil. NPK ferti li zation and cow manure amendment reduced pathogen survival in most soils while compost was not effective. There was a clear shift in microbial community after manure amendment, a weak shift by compost amendment, and no shift after NPK ferti li zation. Disease development was highest in Dutch san dy soils and similar in all other soil types. It was positively correlated with DOC (substrate availabi li ty), and negatively with K and Ca contents in soil, which may increase plant resistance. The disease was s li ghtly suppressed in organic compared to conventional san dy soils from Egypt while organic management increased disease incidence in all Dutch soils. This was related to a high DOC content in organic Dutch soils. There were no differences in bacterial diversity and composition in different rhizosphere soils, and no correlations between disease development and bacterial diversity. Manure ferti li zation suppressed brown rot in most soils with a clear shift in rhizospere bacterial community. Stenotrophomonas maltophi li a, isolated from the rhizosphere of eggplant in the Egyptian Delta, was antagonistic to R. solanacearum in vitro; its antagonistic activity was not Fe-siderophore dependent. A selected S. maltophi li a strain survived longer and reduced R. solanacearum survival more in Egyptian than in Dutch clay soils, and suppressed potato brown rot in Egyptian soil (by at least 36 %) but not in Dutch soil. Survival and suppressive activity of S. maltophi li a were positively correlated with OM, which was highest in Egyptian organic clay soil. The effect of biological soil disinfestation (BSD) was tested in glass vessels, microplots, and in an accidentally infested commercial field. BSD is based on production of toxic organic acids through anaerobic digestion of fresh organic matter. BSD was accomp li shed by incorporating grass or <b>potato</b> <b>haulms</b> in soil and covering the soil with airtight plastic. Survival of R. solanacearum in soil and potato tubers was significantly reduced in the BSD treatment (> 93 %), and not in separate g rass amendment -or plastic cover treatments. This thesis may contribute to regulatory decisions in the EU concerning the time required for keeping accidentally infested fields out of potato production and to recommendations for management of potato brown rot in areas where the disease is endemic...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study effects of {{production}} history on tuber sprout, root, stem development and crop yield of seed potato cultivars Fambo and Van Gogh were investigated in the High Grade Area of Finland (64. 9 N, 25. 4 E). The <b>haulms</b> of seed <b>potatoes</b> were destroyed {{at the time of}} flowering (50 days after planting, DAP), three weeks after flowering (75 DAP) and as a control the haulm was left to natural death until harvest (95 DAP). The temperature sum accumulation of the seed potatoes was recorded for the growing season and storage period. In addition, the use of plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA) in sprout control was also investigated. The results indicated that cultivar properties had a greater effect on the sprouting and crop yield of seed <b>potatoes</b> than production-phased <b>haulm</b> killing or temperature sum accumulation. Haulm killing carried out at three weeks after flowering (75 DAP) accelerated the emergence of both cultivars significantly compared to killing at 50 DAP or 95 DAP. Gibberellic acid (GA) treatments significantly increased the number of sprouts and at lower concentration (100 mM) GA increased the number of tubers in the cultivar Fambo. Thus, the timing of haulm killing {{and in the case of}} Fambo, GA treatment influenced the characteristics of seed potatoes produced in th...|$|R
