40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} {{with the use of the}} cost of poor quality to identify areas for quality improvement, and to measure the results of the improvements. These improvements will show off in increased profit and increased customer satisfaction. A practically implementable method is developed for estimating and minimising quality costs in the manufacturing sector, and is demonstrated by 2 case studies. This method is based on the traditional Prevention-Appraisal- Failure (PAF) model. Three major modifications are made. The author argues that <b>Prevention</b> <b>cost</b> should not be included, due to the time lag before an increase in this cost pays off, and also because the collection of <b>Prevention</b> <b>cost</b> does not add any new knowledge. The External Failure cost is redefined to exclude warranty and liability cost. An attempt to include Invisible cost is made. In this way the customers view are incorporated into the model. The important thing about the model is not so much the absolute size of the quality problems in itself, but that the quality problems are identified and that the size of the problems is evaluated in monetary terms. Ranking the problems in monetary order is a good starting point for setting goals for quality improvements. The cost justification for attacking a specific quality problem can then be shown using Return On Investment (ROI), Residual Value and Net Present Value (NPV). The author argues that in general, NPV should be used to prioritise quality improvement projects. However, benefits that cannot be quantified, should at least be qualified and taken into account...|$|E

30|$|Parasitism, or more {{appropriately}} gastro-intestinal (GI) parasitism, {{is arguably the}} most serious parasitological constraint affecting small ruminants’ (e.g. goat, sheep) production worldwide. Economic losses are caused by decreased production, cost of <b>prevention,</b> <b>cost</b> of treatment, and ultimately through the death of infected animals (Barger, 1982; Donald et al., 1982; Perri et al., 2011; Mejla et al. 2011; Cringoli et al., 2004; Mes, 2003; Longo Ribeiro Vilela et al. 2012). The control of GI parasites traditionally relies on grazing management (Perri, et al., 2011), anthelmintic treatment (Costa et al., 2006) or both. However, grazing management schemes are often impractical due to expense or due to the hardiness of infective larvae on pasture. In addition, the evolution of anthelmintic resistance in parasite population threatens the success of drug treatment programmes (Craig, 2006; Prichard, 1990; Waller, 1994; Conder and Campbell 1995; Sangster, 1999). So, the aim of any parasite control program must therefore be to ensure that parasite populations do not exceed threshold levels such that eventual productivity rates are consistently compatible with expected levels of economic production.|$|E

The carbon productivity concept is a cause of production increase that offset production decrease factor depending on green-house gas reduction. The potential environment pollution index presents the possibility of environment pollution through construction phase. The carbon productivity is ‘Construction cost/Carbon emission’. The construction costs are consisted of material, equipment, labour cost and indirect expenses. Carbon emissions are calculated by emission for material production and equipment fuel consumption.

The costs of `road hazard' in the Netherlands as calculated for both years have been classified into four main groups: (1) medical costs; (2) human production loss; (3) property damage to and by passenger cars; and (4) costs of handling and prevention. The calculations show a rather high increase in costs within each main group in 1993 compared with 1983.

40|$|THE ECONOMICS OF PSYCHO-SOCIAL RISKS. Preface. The aim of {{the essay}} is to show the SHIELD {{methodology}} for helping the firm management to improve the risks prevention policy. It has been tested in the field with positive results. SHIELD is a cost-benefit analysis application to compare <b>prevention</b> and non-prevention <b>costs,</b> which arise from non- market risks. In the economic perspective safety risks (which include psycho-social risks) are non-market ones as they cause injures to workers during the job. SHIELD (Social Health Indicators for Economic Labour Decisions), is the original method proposed by the author. It is a cost benefits analysis application, which compares safety <b>prevention</b> and non-prevention <b>costs.</b> The comparison allow stop management to evaluate {{the efficiency of the}} current safety prevention policy as it helps top management to answer to the policy question: how much to invest in <b>prevention</b> <b>costs?</b> The costs comparison is obtained through the reclassification of safety <b>costs</b> between <b>prevention</b> and non-prevention <b>costs</b> (which are composed by claim damages and penalty sanction costs). Results and conclusions. SHIELD has been tested empirically in four companies operating in the agribusiness sector during a research financed by the Assessorato all’Agricoltura and INAI Regionale of Emilia Romagna Region. Results are positive: it has been found that the increase of <b>prevention</b> <b>costs</b> causes the cut of non-prevention costs in all companies looked into, as assumed by the high reliability organization theory. SHIELD can be applied to all companies which must have an accounting system by law, no matter of the industry they act. Its application has limited costs as SHIELD doesn’t need changes in the accounting system. Safety costs sustained by the company are simply reclassified in <b>prevention</b> and non-prevention <b>costs.</b> The comparison of these two costs categories has been appreciated by top management of companies investigated as a useful support to decide the risks prevention policy for the company.

Failure management is essential for DSPSs that often require highlyavailable system operations. In this paper, we explore a new predictive failure management approach that employs online failure prediction to achieve more efficient failure management than previous reactive or proactive failure management approaches. We employ light-weight streambased classification methods to perform online failure forecast. Based on the prediction results, the system can take differentiated failure preventions on abnormal components only. Our failure prediction model is tunable, which can achieve a desired tradeoff between failure penalty reduction and <b>prevention</b> <b>cost</b> based on a user-defined reward function. To achieve low-overhead online learning, we propose adaptive data stream sampling schemes to adaptively adjust measurement sampling rates based on the states of monitored components, and maintain a limited size of historical training data using reservoir sampling. We have implemented an initial prototype of the predictive failure management framework within the IBM System S distributed {{stream processing}} system. Experiment results show that our system can achieve more efficient failure management than conventional reactive and proactive approaches, while imposing low overhead to the DSPS. ...|$|E

Design and setting: Using 2 years of nationally representative observational data, this study examined the effect on household income of IHD. This effect was estimated after accounting for unemployment, days lost to illness and other effects of illness on the income of workers aged 18 to 64 years. Main outcome measures and results: Previous measures of indirect costs of disease have typically not included the loss in productivity due to suboptimal work performance. Among workers in this age group, IHD was associated with a reduction of $US 3013 in annual household income; this reduction was independent of occupational class, age, size of household and educational level. Such a reduction may be because of reduced on-the-job performance, employer perception of this, or unrelated lifestyle choices. It represents an estimated $US 6. 05 billion annual loss in productivity in 1992 dollars (or $US 6. 45 billion in 1996 dollars).
