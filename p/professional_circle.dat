To do this, an interdisciplinary group of researchers and teachers from a Secondary School created a <b>Professional</b> <b>Circle</b> for Reflection on Teaching, which constructed an emerging conceptualization of Territory, analyzed the possibilities of the local area and established a relationship with the national curriculum. On this basis the TLS were designed, with an interdisciplinary aspect, and implemented with pupils aged 14 to 17. The results show that the contextualization of teaching through the use of local territory is possible, and is positive for pupils, and that collaborative work and reflection by teachers are fundamental for this process...|$|E
40|$|Hazing in the Military: A Pilot Study “Hazing is an {{extraordinary}} activity that, when it occurs often enough, becomes perversely ordinary as those who engage in it grow desensitized to its inhumanity ” (Newer, 1999). Hazing is an activity typically steeped in tradition, bound by silence, and ritualistic in nature. Hazing is thought to mark a transition, celebrate an achievement, or bring someone into a social or <b>professional</b> <b>circle.</b> However, hazing costs and sometimes kills. The cost of a hazing incident at the U. S. Air Force academy in 2012, for example, amounted to $ 14, 062. 50 worth of lost productivity {{in a single day}} for the 27 cadets involved. Hazing also kills. In 2012, one Army soldier took his own life in response to alleged hazing. Hazing kills organizations as well as individuals. In the case of the soldier, his entire unit was disbanded as the investigation took place and the Army received an onslaught of negative press. No service is immune to hazing, as all have experienced incidents and repercussions. Hazing takes away from missions as well. For example, in 2009, in the Dhi Qar province of Iraq, U. S. soldiers shot an ancient guard tower. Shooting the tower was an act of inclusion for new members of the team.

Over the past 20 years, {{with the development}} of genetics, auxology, stem cell biology, and tissue engineering, tissue repair and regeneration have rapidly developed as emerging "Regenerative Medicine". Regenerative medicine has significant market demand in China. Based on national statistics, injury and poisoning patients rank third in afflictions in city hospitals (accounting for 9. 13 %) and rank second in afflictions in county hospitals (accounting for 14. 07 %). Totally, approximately one hundred million patients suffered from traumatic, genetic and metabolic diseases in China and demand reparative and regenerative medical treatment each year. The Chinese government and its related departments have always attached great importance and support to the development of regenerative medicine, and the Chinese academic circle is involved in a very wide range of diseases and injuries including regenerative medical theory and technology. Stem cell biology, organ engineering and duplication, tissue engineering research and production have developed rapidly, and great portion of these studies have started to appear in applications, which have aroused extensive concerns in international <b>professional</b> <b>circle.</b> In the next 10 years, the Chinese regenerative medical system will be further improved, in both statute and rules, clinical translation will be further accelerated.

40|$|Now {{we live in}} the age of professionalism, and {{the public}} office in any nation is some {{reservoir}} of intelligent competition in their specific field. They are the leaders and paragon of community as a loyal and professional fiduciary. A hybrid nature of officers creates the rules and exercises their professional knowledge to serve a public good. The not unusual word,“scholar practitioner” may reflect the tendency of learning community within the business and government officers. They wish to overcome a bum rap, say, most unproductive group or bureaucrats in maze, attributed to the bureaucrats generally. They now are required to be not only a manager but also professional researcher for his or her specific field of expertise.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} centred on the {{analysis}} of how the different groups of specialist experts that make up theoretical physics at large communicate and transmit knowledge between themselves. The analysis is carried out using two sociological frameworks: the Studies in Expertise and Experience (SEE) approach Collins and Evans, and mechanisms of sociological and institutional trust in the general sociology of science literature. I argue that the communication process is carried out in two ways: through interactional expertise {{that is based on}} deep comprehension when the interaction is between micro-cultures that are sociologically closely connected, and through lower forms of knowledge relying on trust for the micro-cultures that are sociologically far apart. Because the SEE framework is strongly based on the transmission of tacit knowledge, an analysis of the importance of tacit knowledge in theoretical physics is carried out to support the SEE analysis, and specific types of tacit knowledge are closely examined to understand how they shape theoretical physics practice. I argue that `physical intuition', one of the guiding principles of all theoretical activity, is in fact a type of tacit knowledge -somatic tacit knowledge- that is well known within social studies of science. The end result is a description of physics that highlights the importance of sociological mechanisms that hold the discipline together, and that permit knowledge to flow from the empirical to the theoretical poles of physics practice. The thesis is supported by unstructured interview material and by the author's prolonged interaction within theoretical physics <b>professional</b> <b>circle...</b>|$|E
40|$|On January 4, 2012, the centenary of Henri Poincaré's death, a {{colloquium}} {{was held}} in Nancy, France the subject of which was "Vers une biographie d'Henri Poincaré". Scholars discussed several approaches for writing a biography of Poincaré. In this paper I present a personal and scientific biographical sketch of Poincaré, which does {{not in any way}} reflect Poincaré's rich personality and immense activity in science: When Poincaré traveled to parts of Europe, Africa and America, his companions noticed that he knew well everything from statistics to history and curious customs and habits of peoples. He was almost teaching everything in science. He was so encyclopedic that he dealt with the outstanding questions in the different branches of physics and mathematics; he had altered whole fields of science such as non-Euclidean geometry, Arithmetic, celestial mechanics, thermodynamics and kinetic theory, optics, electrodynamics, Maxwell's theory, and other topics from the forefront of Fin de Siècle physical science. It {{is interesting to note that}} as opposed to the prosperity of biographies and secondary papers studying the life and scientific contributions of Albert Einstein, one finds much less biographies and secondary sources discussing Poincaré's life and work. As opposed to Einstein, Poincaré was not a cultural icon. Beginning in 1920 Einstein became a myth and a world famous figure. Although Poincaré was so brilliant in mathematics, he mainly remained a famous mathematician within the <b>professional</b> <b>circle</b> of scientists. He published more papers than Einstein, performed research in many more branches of physics and mathematics, received more prizes on his studies, and was a member of more academies in the whole world. Despite this tremendous yield, Poincaré did not win the Nobel Prize...|$|E

40|$|After {{the concept}} of "platinum 10 minutes" in {{emergency}} rescue of a seriously injured was proposed, both narrow and broad concepts concerning the proposal were gradually formed. In a relatively short time, the concept has received widespread concern, both from <b>professional</b> <b>circle</b> and society at large. However, "platinum 10 minutes" in emergency salvage is handicapped by two "blind" areas, namely, a period of lacking first aid and a period of shortage of professional medical treatment. It should be emphasized that timely treatment is the motive and goal of a successful salvage of a seriously injured individual. Therefore, in a sense a successful salvage of a seriously injured depends on three factors, namely, time, space, and first aider, {{in order to achieve}} such a goal. Among these three factors the time lag before a successful first aid should be considered {{to be the most important}} factor. Therefore, the first witness, though he or she may not be a health professional, is the core individual to carry out first aid in order to save the life of the victim. In this sense, it should be recognized that "buddy" aid, or first aid performed by a layman is the beginning and foundation of a successful salvage, as it is evident that it could not be performed by a professional who is not readily available. First aid at the scenario is not only life saving, but it lays the foundation for a successful salvage of the victim. In many instances, it might be more valuable than professional treatment. Therefore, first aid effort at the site of accident should not be neglected, on the other hand, it should be re-emphasized. It not only lays a good foundation for final professional treatment, it should be considered as the important link of a successful salvage of a seriously wounded person. Therefore, a high quality first aid given by a laymen within a few minutes after injury, not only it is life-saving, but also it should be regarded as an independent link in the course of life saving of a seriously injured. Though it is such an important and most effective step in "platinum 10 minutes", yet it is at present the weakest link. Therefore, it behoves us not only to re-emphasize it, but also recommend self aid and aid by a bystander as a nation-wide strategy in the treatment of seriously injured individuals...|$|E
