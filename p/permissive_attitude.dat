5|$|The <b>permissive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward {{business}} did {{not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture capital in the state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state {{would lead to a}} loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of antitrust lawsuits by the state Attorney General starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.|$|E
5|$|Helen {{went away}} for a period in June 1941, during which Parsons, {{encouraged}} {{to do so by}} the sexually <b>permissive</b> <b>attitude</b> of the O.T.O., began a sexual relationship with her 17-year-old sister, Sara. Upon Helen's return, Sara asserted that she was Parsons' new wife, and Parsons himself admitted that he found Sara more sexually attractive than Helen. Conflicted in her feelings, Helen sought comfort in Smith and began a relationship with him that lasted {{for the rest of his}} life; the four remained friends. The two couples, along with a number of other Thelemites (some of whom with their children), moved to 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, an American Craftsman-style mansion. They all contributed to the rent of $100 a month and lived communally in what replaced Winona Boulevard as the new base of the Agape Lodge, maintaining an allotment and slaughtering their own livestock for meat as well as blood rituals. Parsons decorated his new room with a copy of the Stele of Revealing, a statue of Pan, and his collection of swords and daggers. He converted the garage and laundry room into a chemical laboratory and often held science fiction discussion meetings in the kitchen, and entertained the children with hunts for fairies in the 25-acre garden.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine attitudes of Slovene {{adolescents}} toward suicide and their connection to different suicide risk factors and subjective well being. Data was collected on 423 high school students from three regions, chosen by their suicide rate, with ATTS (Attitudes towards Suicide Questionnaire) and PWBS (Psychological Well-Being Scales). Risk factors for suicide included gender, family status, parents' education, school success as well as suicide behaviour of adolescent, his family and others and self reported probability of suicide. The results did not prove our expectation of girls having more <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward suicide than boys and also showed some other interesting gender specific perceptions of suicidal behaviour. <b>Permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> were further positively associated with the majority of risk factors as well as the suicide rates of the three regions; the most <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward suicide were found in the area with the highest suicide rate. Statistically important negative correlation of <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> with subjective well-being on different psychological domains supports our finding of <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward suicide being one of the possible risk factors for suicidal behaviour.

40|$|Aim: Adolescents in Vietnam have a {{low level}} of sexual activity, but this may {{increase}} with urbanisation and economic development. The aim of this analysis is to understand trends in correlates of <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards premarital sex among Vietnamese adolescents using an ecological framework. Methods: Data from the Survey Assessment of Vietnamese Youth from 2003 (n = 7584) and 2009 (n = 10 044) were analysed using multivariable logistic regressions to examine associations between <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards premarital sex and demographic and contex-tual factors among adolescents aged 14 to 25. Results: Correlates of having <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards premarital sex in both 2003 and 2009 included being male, older age, living in an urban area, living in the North, having ever used the Internet and perceiving that people in the community were having premarital sex. Variables that were significant in 2009 but not in 2003 included socio-economic status and belonging to an ethnic minority. Statistically significant changes in associations between 2003 and 2009 were observed for age, socio-economic status and belonging to an ethnic minority. Conclusions: The association of <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> with community norms and certain socio-demographic variables in conjunction with overarching economic development and urbanisation suggests that premarital sex will likely become increasingly common among Vietnamese adolescents. These trends should be further assessed as adolescent sexual activity becomes more common and adolescent friendly health services should be developed to provide appropriate and acceptable sexual and reproductive health care to young people.

40|$|Models {{explaining}} {{the relationship between}} victimisation and violence typically fail to include any mediation variables {{to account for the}} difference between victimised individuals that become violent in adulthood and those that don’t. A model was proposed, using a Gold Coast community sample of 250 individuals (79 males, 138 females, 33 no answer) with a median age 41 - 45, that violent thoughts (measured as violent fantasies and <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards violence) mediate the relationship between victimisation (measured retrospectively) and aggression. The study controlled for gender and social desirability bias. The model consisted of a distal stage (victimisation and gender), proximal stage (<b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards violence and violent fantasies) and an outcome stage (aggression).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sexuality in {{the elderly}} still remains a taboo, {{especially}} in the institutional context. Demographic changes have been occurring these past few years which led {{to an increase in}} the number of institutionalized elders, as an attempt to respond their needs. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to know the levels of knowledge and attitudes of the professional caregivers, how these are related and how these relate with the socio demographic variables. METHODS: Quantitative, exploratory, comparative and correlational study. Convenience sample of professional caregivers (n= 329), which accepted to participate by answering to the Aging Sexual Knowledge and Attitudes Scale (ASKAS), which allowed the knowledge and attitudes measure about sexuality {{in the elderly}}. RESULTS: There is a positive correlation between the knowledge levels and the attitudes and, generally, the caregivers present good knowledge levels and the attitudes about sexuality in the elderly are permissive. However, there is a difference between the qualified technicians and the auxiliary staff, as the former present better knowledge levels and more <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes.</b> Generally, the individuals with higher educational qualifications also present higher knowledge levels and more <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes.</b> None of subjects referred attending any kind of training or education in this area. Single individuals present better knowledge levels and more <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> than the married ones. The older individuals present less <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> as well as the more experienced caregivers. CONCLUSION: The knowledge is related with the attitudes about sexuality in the elderly. This topic remains a delicate subject for many of the individuals, especially for who work in an institutional context. Education and training of these caregivers and a continuous research play a key role in the quality of life of the elders and the quality of the provided services...|$|R

For women, {{there is a positive}} association between being sexually active, having sexually <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes,</b> drinking alcohol and being a victim of certain types of sexual coercive strategies. For men, sexually <b>permissive</b> <b>attitudes</b> and attitudes toward rape are found to be significant predictors of their use of verbal coercion.

It {{is by no means}} inconsistent with Aguilar."The dissent argued that the two pronged test of the honesty of the informant and the basis of knowledge was more protective of a citizen's rights, leaving less chance of a warrant being issued based upon the claims of a dishonest or unreliable [...] "informant." [...] The dissenters believed that the Aguilar–Spinelli test was effective and should not have been replaced; that tests and laws that protect the rights of accused are too easily disregarded because the court and law enforcers are eager to prosecute suspects; and that the rights of the suspects also have to be protected. The dissenters stated,"By replacing Aguilar and Spinelli with a test that provides no assurance that magistrates, rather than the police, or informants, will make determinations of probable cause; imposes no structure on magistrates’ probable-cause inquiries; and invites the possibility that intrusions may be justified on less than reliable information from an honest or credible person, today’s decision threatens to obliterate one of the most fundamental distinctions between our form of government, where officers are under the law, and the police-state, where they are the law." [...] Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall also argued that the court did not show any persuasive reason for rejecting Aguilar and Spinelli, saying that the Court “reflects impatience with what it perceives to be overly technical rules governing searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment.” The dissenters supported their opinion by stating that, “Words such as practical, nontechnical, and common sense, as used in the Court’s opinion, are but code words for an overly <b>permissive</b> <b>attitude</b> towards police practices in derogation of the rights secured by the Fourth Amendment.” In other words, taking away suspects' rights is not a correct way to enforce drug laws, even though drug trafficking is reprehensible. The dissenters would have affirmed the Illinois court and excluded the evidence.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether {{the development of}} sexualized media consumption and <b>permissive</b> sexual <b>attitudes</b> would be more strongly interrelated when adolescents perceived sexualized media images as highly realistic. We used data from a three-wave longitudinal sample of 444 Dutch adolescents aged 13 - 16 years at baseline. Results from parallel process latent growth modeling multigroup analyses showed that higher initial levels of sexualized media consumption were associated with higher initial level of <b>permissive</b> sexual <b>attitudes.</b> Moreover, increases of sexualized media consumption over time were associated with increases of <b>permissive</b> sexual <b>attitudes</b> over time. Considering the moderation by perceived realism, we found these effects only for those who perceived sexualized media as more realistic. Findings {{for male and female}} adolescents were similar except for the relations between initial levels and subsequent development. Among male adolescents who perceived sexualized media images to be realistic, higher initial levels of <b>permissive</b> sexual <b>attitudes</b> were related to subsequent less rapid development of sexualized media consumption. For male adolescents who perceived sexualized media to be less realistic, higher initial levels of sexualized media consumption were related to a subsequent less rapid development of <b>permissive</b> sexual <b>attitudes.</b> These relations were not found for female adolescents. Overall, our results suggest that, in male and female adolescents, those {{with a high level of}} perceived realism showed a correlated development of sexualized media consumption and <b>permissive</b> sexual <b>attitudes.</b> These findings point to a need for extended information on how to guide adolescents in interpreting and handling sexualized media in everyday life...|$|R

2500|$|Many {{cultures}} {{define the}} transition into adultlike sexuality by specific biological or social milestones in an adolescent's life. For example, menarche (the first menstrual {{period of a}} female), or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or <b>permissive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward teen or premarital sexual activity. In the United States specifically, adolescents {{are said to have}} [...] "raging hormones" [...] that drive their sexual desires. These sexual desires are then dramatized regarding teen sex and seen as [...] "a site of danger and risk; that such danger and risk is a source of profound worry among adults". There is little to no normalization regarding teenagers having sex in the U.S., which causes conflict in how adolescents are taught about sex education. There is a constant debate about whether abstinence-only sex education or comprehensive sex education should be taught in schools and this stems back {{to whether or not the}} country it is being taught in is permissive or restrictive. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur. In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects. For instance, some cultures find teenage sexual activity acceptable but teenage pregnancy highly undesirable. Other cultures do not object to teenage sexual activity or teenage pregnancy, as long as they occur after marriage. In permissive societies, overt sexual behavior among unmarried teens is perceived as acceptable, and is sometimes even encouraged. Regardless of whether a culture is restrictive or permissive, there are likely to be discrepancies in how females versus males are expected to express their sexuality. Cultures vary in how overt this double standard is—in some it is legally inscribed, while in others it is communicated through social convention. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth face much discrimination through bullying from those unlike them and may find telling others that they are gay to be a traumatic experience. The range of sexual attitudes that a culture embraces could thus be seen to affect the beliefs, lifestyles, and societal perceptions of its adolescents.|$|E
