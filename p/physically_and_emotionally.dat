To avoid debtor's prison he fled to Moscow, where his two eldest sons, Alexander and Nikolay, were attending university. The family lived in poverty in Moscow, Chekhov's mother <b>physically</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotionally</b> broken by the experience.

5|$|Process {{theology}} {{argues that}} God is not omnipotent: rather than coercion, {{he has the}} power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels {{the pain of the}} world (both <b>physically</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotionally)</b> and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive role in the world. Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ex nihilo (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with showing Madonna, the torero (Muñoz), and the townspeople {{preparing}} for, then attending, a bullfight. A secondary staging {{in the video}} presents Madonna standing or sitting near a television set in a room (lit by a single light source from above), while a third staging depicts Madonna writhing around on a bed in her underwear as she watches Muñoz on the television. In the bullring, the torero kills the bull and then comes home and <b>physically</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotionally</b> abuses Madonna. The video {{can be viewed as}} a statement on classicism, supposing the bullfighter feels threatened and angered by the aristocrat's station, resulting in his physically abusing and then coldly abandoning her.|$|E

Morrison decided afterwards to take a vacation break, returning to Ireland after a six-year absence obtensibly to record an RTÉ national TV show. Having gone through divorce proceedings earlier in the year, Morrison was now accompanied by his new fiancee, Carol Guida.

25|$|As a child, Berdella was intelligent, but {{a classic}} loner who rarely played outside his own home, and seldom had friends visit his home to socialize with him. He was also {{severely}} nearsighted (resulting in his {{being required to}} wear thick glasses {{from the age of}} five) and afflicted with a slight speech impediment. Furthermore, as a child, he would be diagnosed as suffering from a high blood pressure, for which he was prescribed several medications. In part because of this diagnosis, Berdella was largely unathletic, whereas his younger brother, Daniel (b. 1956), displayed an aptitude for various sports from an early age. As Berdella's father valued sports and physical education, he viewed his older son's lack of interest in sports as a sign of failure on Berdella's part, and would often compare him unfavorably with his younger brother. Occasionally, Berdella's father would also become <b>physically</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotionally</b> abusive against his children, and is known to have beaten them with a leather strap.|$|E

25|$|Harley Race {{had been}} wrestling for {{over twenty years}} and was <b>physically</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotionally</b> exhausted. He took time off from {{professional}} wrestling, and his loss at Starrcade {{is seen as the}} torch-passing to Ric Flair. Flair's win at Starrcade was significant as it made Flair as a reputable champion. During an international tour in early 1984, without the approval of the NWA board of directors, Flair lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Race on March 21 in Wellington, New Zealand, and won it back two days later in Singapore. This was done to increase attendance of the events, and the title changes were not recognized by the NWA until years later. Race did not win the title again. On May 6, Kerry Von Erich won the title from Flair as a tribute to Kerry's brother David, who died in February. Flair won the title back eighteen days later. At the end of Starrcade, Dusty Rhodes made a challenge to Flair for the title, and this led to their title match at the following year's Starrcade. The feud between Carlos Colon and Abdullah the Butcher continued for over a decade while other feuds ended with their match at Starrcade.|$|E
