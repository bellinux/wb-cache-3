5|$|Antioxidants {{are used}} as food {{additives}} to help guard against food deterioration. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping {{in the dark and}} sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant respiration, storing <b>plant</b> <b>materials</b> in anaerobic conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors. Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or fungal spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food. These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as propyl gallate (PG, E310), tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA, E320) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, E321).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{previous}} studies, limited dispersal {{was revealed}} {{to be the main}} obstacle to restoration of species-rich flood-meadows along the northern Upper Rhine in Germany. To overcome dispersal limitation we transferred freshly mown <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> from species-rich sources to a restoration site on a former arable field. Before <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> application, topsoil was removed to accelerate nutrient impoverishment and create favourable conditions for seedling recruitment. Topsoil removal led to a drastic reduction in organic matter and essential mineral nutrients to the level of target communities (P) or even below (N, K). At a removal depth of 30 cm content of the soil seed bank that comprised exclusively of annual arable weeds, ruderals and some common grassland species, declined by 60 - 80 %, while at a removal depth of 50 cm the seed bank was almost completely eliminated. With few exceptions, all species recorded in source <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> were found established at the restoration site. However, the overall correlation between seed content in <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> and estab-lishment success was not very high. Vegetation development at the restoration site was charac-terized by a rapid decline in arable weeds and ruderals, while resident grassland species and species transferred with <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> increased rapidly from the third year onwards. After four years as many as 102 species were established that could be exclusively attributed to <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> transfer, among them many rare and highly endangered plants. Establishment of species from <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> was most successful in regularly flooded plots, due to the suppression of competitors as well as the creation of favourable moisture conditions for seedling emergence. Diaspore transfer with <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> proved to be an extremely successful method in restoring species-rich grass-land. However, high quality of <b>plant</b> <b>material</b> and suitable site conditions with low competition in early stages of succession seem to be essential prerequisites...|$|R

The objectives of this study were to investigate (a) effects of weight class and type of <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> on fruit quality, heterogeneity in quality and proportion and yield of fruits meeting European export standards, and (b) the improvement in quality, proportion and yield of fruits meeting export standards when flowering was induced at optimum time. Experiments were conducted in Benin with cvs Sugarloaf (a Perola type) and Smooth Cayenne. In cv. Sugarloaf, experimental factors were weight class of <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> (light, mixed, heavy) and time of flowering induction (farmers', optimum) (Experiment 1). In cv. Smooth Cayenne an additional experimental factor was the type of <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> (hapas, ground suckers, a mixture of the two) (Experiment 2). Fruits from heavy <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> had higher infructescence and fruit weights, longer infructescences, shorter crowns, and smaller crown: infructescence length than fruits from light <b>planting</b> <b>material.</b> The type of <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> in Experiment 2 did not significantly affect fruit quality except crown length: fruits from hapas had shorter crowns than those from ground suckers. Crops from heavy <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> had a higher proportion and yield of fruits meeting export standards than those from other weight classes in Experiment 1 only; also the type of <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> in Experiment 2 did not affect these variates. Heterogeneity in fruit quality was usually not reduced by selecting only light or heavy <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> instead of mixing weights; incidentally the coefficient of variation was significantly reduced in fruits from heavy slips only. Heterogeneity was also not reduced by not mixing hapas and ground suckers. Flowering induction at optimum time increased the proportion and yield of fruits meeting export standards in fruits from light and mixed slip weights and in those from the mixture of heavy hapas plus ground suckers...|$|R
40|$|This {{study on}} sweetpotato seed systems was {{conducted}} in Mukono, Kamuli, Bukedea and Soroti districts in Uganda, and in Mwanza, Shinyanga and Meatu regions in the Lake Zone of Tanzania during 2007 – 2011. It aimed at developing simple, affordable and applicable technologies for conserving and multiplying sweetpotato <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> for early season planting after the long dry season. The study sought to understand and describe farmers’ existing approaches, improve on rapid multiplication techniques and develop rational use of available <b>planting</b> <b>material.</b> Complete lack of or insufficient <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> for early <b>planting</b> immediately following the long dry season was reported. Farmers recognised that obtaining <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> early was beneficial as it resulted in increased root yield, an early source of food and sales at high prices. The Triple S (Sand, Storage and Sprouting) method of producing ample <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> for early season planting was developed in Uganda after testing various ways of storing the roots {{during the dry season}} so as to eliminate dry season mortality. Using roots obtained from crops planted in the conventional time and planting them out in watered gardens 1 - 2 mths before the rains to act as sources of sprouts for vine cuttings was the most appropriate. The method was validated in Tanzania which has a longer dry season. The use of 20 cm cuttings instead of the mini cuttings (10 cm) in rapid multiplication of vines needed less labour and care. Pre-planting fertiliser (NPK: 25 : 5 : 5) doubled the quantity of <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> generated, and <b>planting</b> shorter and fewer cuttings than recommended saved <b>planting</b> <b>material</b> to enable more extensive plant coverage and doubled potential production.

The subsidies are often premised on the hope that farmers will eventually absorb the full cost of the <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> once they experience the benefits of consuming OFSP. This study uses data from 481 farmers drawn from different regions that benefited from a sweetpotato project, and the ANOVA and descriptive statistics, to examine farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for OFSP <b>planting</b> <b>materials.</b> It specifically compares the WTP for quality <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> of OFSP and non-OFSP varieties and assesses differences in WTP by region and agroecology. It finds a higher WTP for clean <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> of a non-OFSP variety than for all OFSP varieties studied. It also finds that WTP differs by region and agroecology. The study concludes that there is higher demand for quality <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> of some of the non-OFSP varieties of sweetpotato than for OFSP varieties, and that WTP for differs by intervention area. These findings imply that farmers’ demand for clean <b>planting</b> <b>materials</b> of non-OFSP varieties is higher than for the OFSP varieties.
