50|$|Old Polina is a {{traditional}} Newfoundland folk song.

5000|$|The {{placement}} of the settlement owes much to a sizeable <b>polynia</b> at {{the shore of the}} village, allowing the inhabitants to hunt all year round. The village is situated north of Cape Stoletiya and Southeast of Cape Zelyony on the coast where the Maingyvykvyn, Sirenik-Keivuk and Sineveyem empty into the sea. There are numerous high clifs surrounding the village, some of which have been named by the local people with poetic names such as [...] "Sokol" [...] (falcon) and [...] "Yablochko" [...] (little apple). Nearby is a marine grotto called [...] "Sochi" [...] after the Black Sea resort, which the villagers use for swimming in the summer.|$|E
50|$|Every year, the whaling fleet would sail from Dundee, Scotland to Newfoundland, {{there to}} pick up men to hunt the whales. Since the first ships {{to make it to}} Newfoundland would be able to pick the most {{experienced}} men, it became a bit of a competition to see who could make it in the fastest time. The other ships named in the song, Arctic, Aurora, Terra Nova, and Husky, are all ships from the Dundee Seal and Whale Fishing Company fleet. Aurora was the ship that rescued the crew of <b>Polynia</b> in 1891 when she sunk. Art Jackman, Mullins, and Fairweather were captains of the ships at that time. There are records of a Captain Fairweather in command of Balaena (mentioned in 1894 and 1896), an Alex Fairweather in command of Terra Nova (1885-1893), and a J.

40|$|International audienceDuring winter, thin sea ice {{is formed}} in coastal polynias, areas of open-water within a sea ice pack and {{important}} sites of dense shelf water formation. In the Mertz Glacier <b>polynia</b> (138 °E- 147 °E, East Antarctica), {{we examined the}} effects of an extreme calving event, the last Mertz glacier calving, on the regional sea ice distribution. The high-frequency variability of sea ice concentration was studied for years 1992 to 2011 from passive microwave satellite data with fine spatial (6. 25 km and 12. 5 km) and temporal (1 day) resolutions. Our results showed that the last calving of the Mertz glacier tongue in February 2010 greatly modified {{the size and shape of}} the <b>polynia</b> with a significant westward shift in the regional ice regimes. We also identified a post-calving transition state characterised by a 70 %-decrease in <b>polynia</b> area from the pre-calving mean. In the eastern part of the study area, our findings are in agreement with other studies predicting an important decrease in <b>polynia</b> activity. In the western part, where the main <b>polynia</b> activity has shifted after the calving, the new sea ice distribution is expected to have a major impact on local sea ice production, dense shelf water sinking, and potentially the regional thermohaline circulation. With extreme climatic events predicted to occur more frequently, long-term monitoring of the regional icescape could be used to evaluate the vulnerability of Antarctic physical processes and related ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} {{observations}} and simulations {{of the evolution}} of coastal polynias focusing on the Ronne <b>Polynia.</b> We compare differences in <b>polynia</b> extent and ice drift patterns derived from satellite radar images and from simulations with the Finite Element Sea Ice Ocean Model, employing three atmospheric forcing data sets that differ in spatial and temporal resolution. Two <b>polynia</b> events are analyzed, one from austral summer and one from late fall 2008. The open water area in the <b>polynia</b> is of similar size in the satellite images and in the model simulations, but its temporal evolution differs depending on katabatic winds being resolved in the atmospheric forcing data sets. Modeled ice drift is slower than the observed and reveals greater turning angles relative to the wind direction in many cases. For the summer event, model results obtained with high-resolution forcing are closer to the drift field derived from radar imagery than those from coarse resolution forcing. For the late fall event, none of the forcing data yields outstanding results. Our study demonstrates that a dense (1 – 3 [*]km) model grid and atmospheric forcing provided at high spatial resolution ([*]<[*] 50 [*]km) are critical to correctly simulate coastal polynias with a coupled sea-ice ocean model...|$|E

Two time series of satellite images from the Ronne <b>polynia</b> in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica, and drift vector fields calculated from these time series were analysed. The drift fields were compared with high resolution model results from the Finite Element Sea Ice Ocean Model (FESOM).

40|$|Coastal polynias {{are highly}} {{dynamical}} open water {{areas in the}} sea-ice-covered oceans of the Polar Regions.

In our project, we study the potential of the combination of data from multiple satellite sensors to study the evolution of such <b>polynia</b> events. We will present examples for combinations of different satellite data and analyse retrievable geophysical parameters characterizing <b>polynia</b> events for two test sites in Antarctica. The analysis will include time series from TerraSAR-X, Radarsat- 2, Sentinel- 1, Landsat 8, RapidEye and possibly ALOS- 2 that were acquired between September and December 2014.

40|$|Katabatic wind, a {{gravity driven}} {{atmospheric}} flow {{can be very}} strong on the steepest slopes of the Antarctic ice sheet, and therefore can maintain coastal water areas free of ice (<b>polynia</b> formation). In these ice free zones, strong heat exchanges occur between the cold atmosphere and the relatively warm ocean, with enhanced sea ice formation and salt rejection in the water column. Ocean - atmosphere interactions in the Antarctic coastal zone are investigated under polar night conditions particularly favorable to katabatic winds development. A mesoscale atmospheric model will be coupled to the different surfaces : sea ice, ocean and ice sheet. The first simulation dealt with the coastal water completely recovered by sea ice and the second one with an open water area extending from the coast to 20 km offshore. Although {{the presence of the}} <b>polynia</b> does not influence significantly the simulated katabatic flow itself, the heat transfer between atmosphere and ocean is strongly enhanced when ocean is free of ice, which is specially pronounced for the sensible heat flux...|$|E

40|$|Development {{mechanisms}} of Antarctic mesocyclones {{in the eastern}} Weddell Sea area are examined by means of simulations with a mesoscale model using different idealized initial conditions. In one of the experiments, a mesocyclone develops over an area of open water close to {{the coast of the}} Antarctic continent. The forcing {{mechanisms of}} this mesocyclogenesis are investigated by means of sensitivity studies in which certain physical processes and the relevance of the surface conditions topography, sea surface temperature and sea ice coverage are examined. The sensitivity experiments show that the simulated mesocyclone is forced by an interaction of several forcing mechanisms at different stages of the development rather than by a single mechanism. The topography of the eastern Weddell Sea region and the summertime coastal <b>polynia</b> are shown to be of great importance for the mesocyclogenesis. A suitable synoptic-scale flow is necessary to support the katabatic flow over the sloped ice sheet, and to enhance the generation of cyclonic vorticity due to vertical stretching for the initial mesocyclogenesis. The diabatic process of the convergence of the sensible and latent heat fluxes in the boundary layer over the coastal <b>polynia</b> then becomes the dominant forcing mechanism for the further development of the mesocyclone...|$|E

40|$|Coupled sea ice - ocean models {{used for}} Arctic- or Antarctic-wide {{simulations}} of sea ice kinematics and dynamics have usually been operated at spatial resolutions {{on the order}} of 100 km. Consequently, the validation of such models has been carried out using data from spaceborne passive microwave radiometers or scatterometers. Recently, a number of models work on finer regular grids or on grids with flexible spatial resolution which is high adjacent to the coast or in areas with spatially highly variable ocean conditions. The Finite Element Sea Ice Ocean Model (FESOM) is based on the latter approach. Areas of specific interest are e. g. coastal polynias since the continuous production of new ice and the resulting release of brine as well as the increased heat flux affect both ocean and atmosphere on local or even regional scales. In a number of studies the evolution of polynias in dependence of environmental conditions was investigated using local flux balance models which describe the balance between the advection of sea ice from the coast and the production rate of new ice. These models neglect interactions with the ocean and internal forces in the ice. In our study we focussed on the simulation of the evolution of coastal polynias using FESOM with three different atmospheric forcing data sets that differ in spatial and temporal resolution. We compared the variation of <b>polynia</b> extent and drift patterns obtained from the model simulations with two time series of Envisat ASAR wide swath images that were acquired in austral summer 2008 (February) and late fall 2008 (June). Our test site was the Ronne <b>Polynia</b> in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica. For the evolution of the <b>polynia</b> extent we found that simulations of the employed sea ice ocean model agree with the observations. The comparison of drift velocities showed that the modeled ice velocities were too small in many cases, and turning angles were slightly too large relative to the data obtained from the radar imagery. This was attributed to the forcing data, in which the wind velocities may have been too low. In summary our results demonstrate that the evolution of polynias can be realistically simulated with coupled sea ice models such as FESOM, provided that the modelling grid is dense (1 - 3 km) and the atmospheric forcing data are provided at high spatial resolution (less than 50 km). Furthermore the study demonstrates the usefulness of high-resolution satellite radar imagery for gathering validation data on regional and local scales...|$|E

While <b>Polynias</b> are the wind and sea currents that prevail in {{the northern and southern}} part of the land mass, which are the causative factors for the large ice free zone in the sea, the eastern and northern winds cause very cold breeze. The rainfall in the land varies between 100 mm and 300 mm but mostly in the form of snow.|$|R
40|$|Antarctica {{plays an}} {{important}} and particular role in the climate system. lts location (South Pole) is responsible {{of the formation of}} an ice sheet which covers entirely the continent. Because of the intense infrared radiative heat losses, cold dense air forms near the surface and flows down to the coast where its daily average speed reaches 200 km/hour at some places. Katabatic flow can thwart the synoptic weather situation and can maintain coastal water areas free of ice. In these ice free zones, strong heat exchanges occur between the cold atmosphere and the relatively warm ocean, with enhanced sea ice formation and salt rejection in the water column. This mechanism {{plays an important}} role in the deep sea water formaton and, because the ocean is an important reservoir of heat and CO 2, it can affect the climate over long time scales. The purpose of the present work is the study of the ocean -atmosphere interactions in the Antarctic coastal zone under polar night conditions which are particularly favorable to katabatic winds development. The spatial evolution of katabatic winds along idealized and realistic slopes representative of Antarctic terrain is investigated using an atmospheric two-dimensional primitive equation model written in terrain following δ- coordinate and with high resolution. The surface heat balance of snow (which is assumed to recover sea ice and continental ice) is computed using a simple soil model. Three first simulations are done with the ocean being recovered by sea ice. The slope is either constant, either realistic (Adélie Land topography is then chosen). Much of the flow evolution is completed by 15 h integration period. Then a downslope momentum forces analysis of the katabatic flow is made, emphasizing on physical mechanisms in the coastal zone. The importance of the reversal of the pressure gradient force in the coastal zone, causing the sudden decay of katabatic winds and the onset of a "sea ice breeze" flow, is discussed. It is shown that the cause of this phenomenon is the pilling up of cold katabatic air in the coastal region. Second the consequences of the absence of sea ice cover on the whole ocean or in a small coastal <b>polynia,</b> are examined. The terrain profile is that of Adélie Land. It is been that a small water area free of ice does not influence the atmospheric circulation signficantly. On the contrary, the heating of the air by an underlaying completely ice free ocean is such that the " sea ice breeze ftow" in the coastal zone is weakened. Finally a <b>polynia</b> model is forced by the output of the atmospheric model in the case of an ocean free of ice. The computed salt fluxes in the <b>polynia</b> are sufficient so that deep sea water can form if the atmospheric circulation is maintained during 2 month...|$|E

40|$|Seismic depth {{soundings}} on Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden Glacier (NFG), NE Greenland, {{reveal an}} overdeepened trough under the floating glacier. The maximum {{depth of the}} trough reaches more than 900 m below sea level. Mass balance calculations indicate considerable ice loss due to strong subglacial melting with a mean melt rate of 8 m/a. The geometry of the cavity and water mass characteristics from CTD measurements suggest {{the existence of a}} well defined regional circulation system. Warm, saline and rather dense water follows the inward inclining basal slope through the deep valley of Dijmphna Sund towards the grounding line. Shallow ridges at the eastern glacier front prevent this water mass entering from that direction. The comparatively cold, fresh and less dense melt water follows the subglacial ice topography leaving the cavity through the gaps towards the east. The abundance of subglacial melt water east of NFG is most probably {{one of the main reasons}} for the semi permanent sea ice cover in this region.

The model allowed deriving a heat/mass transfer law for a heat island, which expresses analytically the turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapour from the water surface to the atmosphere through external parameters: the temperature difference between the open water and the ambient air over surrounding ice,and the static stability in the basic-state atmospheric environment.
