5|$|Nycticebus bengalensis, {{commonly}} known as the Bengal slow loris or northern slow loris, is a strepsirrhine primate in the slow loris genus, Nycticebus. Formerly considered a subspecies of the Sunda slow loris (N.coucang), it was recognized as a distinct species in 2001 by taxonomist and <b>primatologist</b> Colin Groves. It is difficult to distinguish from the other species in its genus.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} folktale on Sumatra and Borneo and {{in popular}} culture, is that male orangutans display sexual attraction to human women, {{and may even}} forcibly copulate with them. The only serious, but anecdotal, report of such an incident taking place, is <b>primatologist</b> Birutė Galdikas' report that her cook was sexually assaulted by a male orangutan. This orangutan, though, was raised in captivity and may have suffered from a skewed species identity, and forced copulation is a standard mating strategy for low-ranking male orangutans.|$|E
5|$|In a 1998 review, <b>primatologist</b> Marc Godinot {{recognized}} Sivaladapidae as {{a separate}} family within the Adapiformes, and this classification has been followed since then. Several genera in addition to Indraloris and Sivaladapis are now allocated to Sivaladapidae, which is known from the Eocene through the Miocene of China, Thailand, Myanmar, India, and Pakistan. Sivaladapids are notable for including by far the youngest adapiforms; {{members of this group}} are otherwise known mostly from the Eocene, but several sivaladapids occurred during the Miocene.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, <b>primatologist</b> James Thorn used {{environmental}} niche modelling in Indonesia {{to supplement}} the poor population data gathered to date to predict the remaining available habitat for slow lorises on the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. These estimates indicated that the Javan slow loris was the most threatened by habitat loss, followed by the Sunda slow loris from Sumatra. The Bornean slow loris was in a better situation since much of its range consists of low-risk areas. Both the Bengal slow loris and pygmy slow loris are found in more than 20protected areas, although their populations are either low or insufficiently recorded.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the most {{intelligent}} primates; they use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes have been extensively studied for their learning abilities. There may even be distinctive cultures within populations. Field studies of the apes were pioneered by <b>primatologist</b> Birutė Galdikas. All three orangutan species are considered to be critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching, habitat destruction, and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild.|$|E
5|$|<b>Primatologist</b> Carel P. van Schaik and {{biological}} anthropologist Cheryl D. Knott further investigated tool use in different wild orangutan populations. They compared geographic variations in tool use {{related to the}} processing of Neesia fruit. The orangutans of Suaq Balimbing (P. abelii) {{were found to be}} avid users of insect and seed-extraction tools when compared to other wild orangutans. The scientists suggested these differences are cultural. The orangutans at Suaq Balimbing live in dense groups and are socially tolerant; this creates good conditions for social transmission. Further evidence that highly social orangutans are more likely to exhibit cultural behaviours came from a study of leaf-carrying behaviours of ex-captive orangutans that were being rehabilitated on the island of Kaja in Borneo.|$|E

5|$|Several more {{species were}} named around 1900, {{including}} Nycticebus menagensis (originally Lemur menagensis) by Richard Lydekker in 1893 and Nycticebus pygmaeus by John James Lewis Bonhote in 1907. However, in 1939 Reginald Innes Pocock consolidated all slow lorises {{into a single}} species, N.coucang, and in his influential 1953 book Primates: Comparative Anatomy and Taxonomy, <b>primatologist</b> William Charles Osman Hill also followed this course. In 1971 Colin Groves recognized the pygmy slow loris (N.pygmaeus) as a separate species, and divided N.coucang into four subspecies, while in 2001 Groves opined there were three species (N.coucang, N.pygmaeus, and N.bengalensis), and that N.coucang had three subspecies (Nycticebus coucang coucang, N.c.menagensis, and N.c.javanicus).|$|E
5|$|The main {{buyers of}} {{medicine}} made from slow lorises are middle- to upper-class women {{between the ages}} of 25 and 45 who primarily use loris rice wine tonic to alleviate the pain of childbirth. One bottle of wine is made by mixing rice wine with the carcasses of three dead animals. Minority groups in Cambodia also use loris-based medicine for treating broken bones, asthma, and sexually transmitted diseases. A survey by <b>primatologist</b> Anna Nekaris etal. (2010) showed that these belief systems were so strong that the majority of respondents expressed reluctance to consider alternatives to loris-based medicines.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion that}} lemurs are unintelligent has been perpetuated by {{the view that}} the neocortex ratio (as a measure of brain size) {{indicates}} intelligence. In fact, <b>primatologist</b> Alison Jolly noted early in her academic career that some lemur species, such as the ring-tailed lemur, have evolved a social complexity similar to that of cercopithecine monkeys, but not the corresponding intelligence. After years of observations of wild ring-tailed lemur populations at the Berenty Reserve in Madagascar and as well as baboons in Africa, she more recently concluded that this highly social lemur species does not demonstrate the equivalent social complexity of cercopithecine monkeys, despite general appearances.|$|E

5|$|Tool use in orangutans was {{observed}} by <b>primatologist</b> Birutė Galdikas in ex-captive populations. In addition, evidence of sophisticated tool manufacture and {{use in the}} wild was reported from a population of orangutans in Suaq Balimbing (Pongo abelii) in 1996. These orangutans developed a tool kit for use in foraging that consisted of both insect-extraction tools {{for use in the}} hollows of trees and seed-extraction tools for harvesting seeds from hard-husked fruit. The orangutans adjusted their tools according {{to the nature of the}} task at hand, and preference was given to oral tool use. This preference was also found in an experimental study of captive orangutans (P. pygmaeus).|$|E
5|$|Five {{years later}} in 1950, he became {{prosector}} for the Zoological Society of London and remained there for twelve years. When he left the London Zoo in 1962, the old prosectorium that has been his office was closed, many preserved biological specimens were discarded, and the era of anatomists working at the London Zoo—starting {{from the time of}} Richard Owen—came to a close. Between 1957 and 1958, Osman Hill also acted as a visiting scholar at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Later in 1958, <b>primatologist</b> Jane Goodall studied primate behaviour under him in preparation for her studies of wild chimpanzees. In 1962, he was hired as the assistant director of the Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC) in Atlanta after being turned down for the position of director.|$|E

25|$|<b>Primatologist</b> Klaus Zuberbühler uses {{these ideas}} to {{help explain the}} {{emergence}} of vocal flexibility in the human species. Co-operative breeding would have compelled infants to struggle actively to gain the attention of caregivers, not all of whom would have been directly related. A basic primate repertoire of vocal signals may have been insufficient for this social challenge. Natural selection, according to this view, would have favoured babies with advanced vocal skills, beginning with babbling (which triggers positive responses in care-givers) and {{paving the way for}} the elaborate and unique speech abilities of modern humans.|$|E
25|$|German anatomist Ernst Schwarz is {{credited}} with being the first Westerner to recognise the bonobo as being distinctive, in 1928, based on his analysis of a skull in the Tervuren museum in Belgium that previously had been thought to have belonged to a juvenile chimpanzee. Schwarz published his findings in 1929. In 1933, American anatomist Harold Coolidge offered a more {{detailed description of the}} bonobo, and elevated it to species status. The American psychologist and <b>primatologist</b> Robert Yerkes {{was also one of the}} first scientists to notice major differences between bonobos and chimpanzees. These were first discussed in detail in a study by Eduard Paul Tratz and Heinz Heck published in the early 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Chimpanzees and bonobos {{are equally}} humanity's closest living relatives.

Field studies of Pan troglodytes were pioneered by <b>primatologist</b> Jane Goodall. Both Pan species are considered to be endangered as human activities have caused severe declines in the populations and ranges of both species. Threats to wild panina populations include poaching, habitat destruction, and the illegal pet trade.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{reconstruct}} and discuss the ways in which “culture” is defi ned in primatology. Surprisingly, this task has not yet been undertaken even within primatology, not to mention the social sciences, which should have a strong interest in new currents in studying the “cultures” of non-human primates. This paper fills an important gap in the literature on how <b>primatologists</b> understand “culture. ” Primatologists’ approaches to “culture” are reduced to four separate typologies, each relating to a different aspect of the proposed defi nitions of “culture. ” Discussing these typologies brings to light how <b>primatologists</b> understand “culture. ” This also makes it possible to indicate the dominant view of “culture” in primatology and to point to directions of change. As will be shown, not only do certain <b>primatologists</b> distance themselves from the more far-reaching ideas of “cultural primatology” but even among representatives of this approach there is no one manner of defining "culture"...|$|R
