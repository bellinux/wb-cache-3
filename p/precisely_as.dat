5|$|The art of measuring, as <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> possible, {{probabilities of}} things, {{with the goal}} {{that we would be}} able always to choose or follow in our {{judgments}} and actions that course, which will have been determined to be better, more satisfactory, safer or more advantageous.|$|E
5|$|Reflector sights as {{aircraft}} gun-sights {{have many}} advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the sight line <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> {{they did in}} two-point mechanical sights, head position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the collimator, mostly by {{the diameter of the}} collimator lens. The sight does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light is turned off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E
5|$|Several of the anecdotes he amassed were {{published}} in magazines and, just before his death, work began on collating {{the first of four}} compendiums of the tales; three {{were published}} a few years after his death. He was fluent in several languages, including Scottish Gaelic, and transcribed the legends <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> dictated by the narrators.|$|E
5000|$|In the Bible, {{it is not}} <b>as</b> <b>precisely</b> defined <b>as</b> other Biblical {{measurements}} of distance; the distance has been estimated from 32 to 40 kilometers (20-25 miles).|$|R
50|$|Even more {{ambiguous}} is fold decrease, {{which is}} more <b>precisely</b> expressed <b>as</b> fractions.|$|R
50|$|The lakes {{are more}} <b>precisely</b> known <b>as</b> North Badger Lake and South Badger Lake.|$|R
5|$|As {{the game}} proceeds, flashbacks occur showing events in Harris and Klebold's lives {{which may have}} caused them to commit murder; real life events are {{compressed}} into the game's timeframe for narrative purposes. Much of the plot is constructed around the events <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> they {{are believed to have}} occurred; lines of the gunmen's dialogue are often lifted verbatim from their writings or from their own home videos of each other. In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized photographs from the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.|$|E
25|$|Terms in {{dependence}} logic are defined <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> in first-order logic.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{distinguishing}} between lies {{according to their}} external severity, Augustine maintains in both treatises that all lies, defined <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> the external communication of what one does not hold to be internally true, are categorically sinful and therefore ethically impermissible.|$|E
30|$|The {{calculation}} process of a triangular triple integral in the 3 D space is <b>precisely</b> defined <b>as</b> follows.|$|R
30|$|The {{calculation}} {{process of the}} triangular double integral on the 2 D plane is <b>precisely</b> defined <b>as</b> follows.|$|R
30|$|The {{calculation}} {{process of the}} triangular quadruple integral in the 4 D time-space is <b>precisely</b> defined <b>as</b> follows.|$|R
25|$|Video {{games have}} similar requirements, with some crucial differences. While {{physical}} simulation needs to simulate real-world physics as <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> possible, video games need to simulate real-world physics in an acceptable way, {{in real time}} and robustly. Compromises are allowed, {{so long as the}} resulting simulation is satisfying to the game players.|$|E
25|$|One part {{of space}} {{is not by}} itself and in the {{absolute}} {{sense of the word}} equal to another part of space, for if it is so for us, it will not be so for the inhabitants of the universe B, and they have <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> much right to reject our opinion as we have to condemn theirs.|$|E
25|$|The courses {{reported}} by both submarines were incorrect, because they reflected one {{leg of a}} zigzag being used by British ships to avoid submarines. Taken with a wireless intercept of more ships leaving Scapa Flow earlier in the night, they created the impression in the German High Command that the British fleet, whatever it was doing, was split into separate sections moving apart, which was <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> the Germans wished to meet it.|$|E

40|$|The fission {{spectrum}} of neutrons plays {{a significant role}} in the construction of nuclear reactors. However, the {{fission spectrum}} of neutrons with kinetic energies less than 1 MeV, emitted from the spontaneous fission of 252 Cf, is not <b>as</b> <b>precisely</b> known <b>as</b> that for higher energy neutrons. A method for making improved measurements of low-energ...|$|R
50|$|South Devon is more <b>precisely</b> defined <b>as</b> {{a natural}} region {{which has been}} {{designated}} as National Character Area 151 by Natural England.|$|R
25|$|The {{operating}} system – not the applications – was {{not capable of}} supporting the demands of advanced users and was prone to crash then restart under heavy load from large, complex spreadsheets or graphs produced from them. To its credit, Apple's warranty said that this software worked <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> stated, and Apple refunded an unspecified number of users in full for their systems, {{both of which were}} unprecedented in the computing business.|$|E
25|$|Knight’s {{work for}} the museum was not without critics, however: many curators argued that his work was more artistic than scientific, and protested {{that he did not}} have {{sufficient}} scientific expertise to render prehistoric animals as <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> he did. While Knight himself agreed that his murals for the Hall of the Age of Man were “primarily a work of art,” he insisted that he had as much paleontological knowledge as the museum’s own curators.|$|E
25|$|The USCA (as the BSC {{was known}} by at that time) {{was founded in}} 1933 by then-director of the YWCA, Harry Kingman. The birth of the USCA, {{as well as many}} other {{cooperative}} organizations around the country, coincided with the Great Depression <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> a response to scant resources. By living together in large houses and pooling together resources, members found that their monetary resources could go further to pay for their cost of living than living separately.|$|E
40|$|AbstractNowhere locally compact {{separable}} metric {{spaces are}} characterized (up to homeomorphism) <b>as</b> <b>precisely</b> the dense subsets of the separable Hilbert space {{and those of}} dimension at most n are characterized (up to homeomorphism) <b>as</b> <b>precisely</b> the dense subsets of the n-dimensional Menger-Nöbeling space...|$|R
50|$|Ovarian serous cystadenoma, also (less <b>precisely)</b> known <b>as</b> serous cystadenoma, is {{the most}} common ovarian neoplasm, {{representing}} 20% of ovarian neoplasms, and is benign.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{significant}} body of evidence that Hydrostatic shock (more <b>precisely</b> known <b>as</b> the ballistic pressure wave) can contribute to handgun bullet effectiveness.|$|R
25|$|In {{the history}} of Western world (sometimes more <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> Greco-Roman world) adopted by the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire, Christian ecclesiastical {{province}}s were named by analogy with the secular Roman province as well as certain extraterritorial formations of western world in early medieval times (see Early Middle Ages). The administrative seat of each province is an episcopal see. In hierarchical Christian churches that have dioceses, a province {{is a collection of}} those dioceses (as a basic unit of administration).|$|E
25|$|Many radical Northerners withdrew {{their support}} for land reform in the years {{following}} the war. One reason for the shift in political opinion was fear by the Republicans that land ownership might lead Blacks to align with Democrats for economic reasons. In general, politicians turned their focus to the legal status of freedpeople. In the analysis of W. E. B. Du Bois, black suffrage became more politically palatable <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> an inexpensive alternative to well-funded agrarian reform.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} {{editing and}} design work, the {{printing}} phase begins. The first step involves {{the production of a}} pre-press proof, which the printers send for final checking and sign-off by the publisher. This proof shows the book <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> it will appear once printed and represents the final opportunity for the publisher to find and correct any errors. Some printing companies use electronic proofs rather than printed proofs. Once the publisher has approved the proofs, printing – the physical production of the printed work – begins.|$|E

50|$|A {{consumer}} insight {{can be more}} <b>precisely</b> defined <b>as</b> :"A non-obvious {{understanding about}} your customers, which if acted upon, {{has the potential to}} change their behaviour for mutual benefit".|$|R
5000|$|Many {{publications}} {{opted to}} review the leaked material as an “album” with Gigwise commenting “there are moments that sound distinctly unfinished. There are periods of silence {{at the end of}} most tracks, there’re only a few smooth segues between the skits and the tracks, and there are periods where the mixing of the vocal track sounds downright bad. The whole album doesn’t feel <b>as</b> <b>precisely</b> balanced <b>as</b> you would expect from Jai Paul.” ...|$|R
25|$|Viktor Suvorov {{suggested}} that Stalin had made aggressive preparations {{beginning in the}} late 1930s and was preparing to invade Germany in the summer 1941. He believes that Hitler forestalled Stalin and the German invasion was in essence a pre-emptive strike, <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> Hitler claimed. This theory was supported by Igor Bunich, Joachim Hoffmann, Mikhail Meltyukhov (see Stalin's Missed Chance) and Edvard Radzinsky (see Stalin: The First In-Depth Biography Based on Explosive New Documents from Russia's Secret Archives). Other historians, especially Gabriel Gorodetsky and David Glantz, reject this thesis. General Fedor von Boch's diary says that the Abwehr fully expected a Soviet attack against German forces in Poland no later than 1942.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to influencing research in theoretical physics, string theory has stimulated {{a number of}} major developments in pure mathematics. Like many developing ideas in theoretical physics, string theory does not at present have a mathematically rigorous formulation in which all of its concepts can be defined <b>precisely.</b> <b>As</b> a result, physicists who study string theory are often guided by physical intuition to conjecture relationships between the seemingly different mathematical structures that are used to formalize different parts of the theory. These conjectures are later proved by mathematicians, and in this way, string theory serves as a source of new ideas in pure mathematics.|$|E
25|$|The head tracker {{registers}} {{the translation}} and {{rotation of the}} user's head. Pointman uses these inputs to map {{the movements of the}} user's head and torso one-for-one to those of his avatar. The virtual view changes as the user turns his head to look around or leans his torso in any direction. When the weapon is raised into an aim position its sights remain centered in the field of view, so that turning the head also adjusts the aim. The user can aim as <b>precisely</b> <b>as</b> he can hold his head on target. Hunching the head down by flexing the spine is also registered by the head's translation, and the avatar adopts a matching posture. Leaning forward and hunching are used to duck behind cover. Rising up and leaning to the side are used to look out and shoot from behind cover.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The page {{described}} {{that never}} {{was such a}} change seen as in his august master {{in the course of}} that single night. His eyes were bloodshot, his face livid, his clothes were hanging loose about him, and he who had always made his appearance on parade <b>as</b> <b>precisely</b> dressed <b>as</b> any sergeant of his troops, might have been seen galloping through the lonely streets at early dawn without a hat, his unpowdered hair streaming behind him like a madman.|$|R
2500|$|At the 1986 FIFA World Cup, Argentina's Carlos Bilardo {{unveiled}} a 3–5–2 formation (or perhaps, more <b>precisely,</b> 3–5–1–1), <b>as</b> his playmaker, Diego Maradona, also operated {{as a second}} striker playing in the [...] "hole".|$|R
50|$|Although not <b>precisely</b> definable <b>as</b> music, {{there are}} signals {{played on the}} trembita (a type of alpenhorn, to signify death, birth, a {{marriage}} or another significant event) by the Hutsuls in the Carpathian mountains.|$|R
