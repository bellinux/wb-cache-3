40|$|The {{ability of}} lentiviral vectors to {{transfer}} genes into human hematopoietic stem cells was studied, using a {{human immunodeficiency virus}} 1 (HIV- 1) -derived vector expressing the green fluorescence protein (GFP) downstream of the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter and pseudotyped with the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). High-efficiency transduction of human cord blood CD 34 (+) cells was achieved after overnight incubation with vector particles. Sixteen to 28 percent of individual colony-forming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) colonies derived from cord blood CD 34 (+) cells were positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the GFP gene. The transduction efficiency of SCID-repopulating cells (SRC) within the cord blood CD 34 (+) population was assessed by serial transplantation into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. When 400, 000 cord blood CD 34 (+) cells were transplanted into <b>primary</b> <b>recipients,</b> all <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>recipients</b> contained and expressed the transgene. Over 50 % of CFU-GM colonies derived from the bone marrow of these <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>recipients</b> contained the vector on average as determined by PCR. Transplantation of transduced cells in limiting dilution generated GFP(+) lymphoid and myeloid progeny cells that may have arisen from a single SRC.
