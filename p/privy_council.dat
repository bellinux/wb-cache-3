5|$|Several other Privy Councils {{have advised}} the sovereign. England and Scotland once had {{separate}} Privy Councils (the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> of England and <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> of Scotland). The Acts of Union 1707 united {{the two countries}} into the Kingdom of Great Britain and in 1708 the Parliament of Great Britain abolished the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> of Scotland. Thereafter there was one <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> of Great Britain sitting in London. Ireland, on the other hand, continued to have a separate <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> even after the Act of Union 1800. The <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> of Ireland was abolished in 1922, when {{the southern part of}} Ireland separated from the United Kingdom; it was succeeded by the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> of Northern Ireland, which became dormant after the suspension of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1972. No further appointments have been made since then, and only four appointees were still living as of May 2014.|$|E
5|$|Distinct from Orders-in-Council are Orders of Council: {{the former}} are issued by the {{sovereign}} upon {{the advice of the}} <b>Privy</b> <b>Council,</b> whereas the latter are made by members of the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> without requiring the sovereign's approval. They are issued under the specific authority of Acts of Parliament, and most commonly are used for the regulation of public institutions.|$|E
5|$|Full {{meetings}} of the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> are held only when the reigning sovereign announces {{his or her own}} engagement (which last happened on 23 November 1839, in the reign of Queen Victoria); or when there is a demise of the Crown, either by the death or abdication of the monarch. A full meeting of the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> was also held on 6 February 1811, when George, Prince of Wales was sworn in as Prince Regent by Act of Parliament. The current statutes regulating the establishment of a regency in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign also require any regents to swear their oaths before the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E

5|$|Her Majesty's Most Honourable <b>Privy</b> <b>Council,</b> usually known {{simply as}} the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council,</b> is a formal body of {{advisers}} to the Sovereign of the United Kingdom. Its membership mainly comprises senior politicians, who are current or former members of either the House of Commons or the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Meetings of the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> are {{normally}} held once each month wherever the sovereign {{may be in}} residence at the time. The quorum, according to the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> Office, is three, though some statutes provide for other quorums (for example, section 35 of the Opticians Act 1989 provides for a lower quorum of two).|$|E

50|$|The {{decision}} {{represents a}} high point of the Supreme Court's adoption of the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council's</b> view of an exceptionally narrow interpretation of the federal government's trade and commerce power, which began to be relaxed in 1971 in Caloil Inc. v. Canada.|$|R
60|$|The Drapier's {{second letter}} was dated August 4th, 1724. A {{few days later}} the English <b>Privy</b> <b>Council's</b> Report, dated 24th July, 1724, arrived in Dublin, and on August 25th, Swift had issued his reply to it in this third letter.|$|R
5|$|Although the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> is {{primarily}} a British institution, officials from some other Commonwealth realms are also appointed. By 2000, the most notable instance was New Zealand, whose Prime Minister, senior politicians, Chief Justice and Court of Appeal Justices were traditionally appointed Privy Counsellors. However, appointments of New Zealand members have since been discontinued. The Prime Minister, the Speaker, the Governor-General and the Chief Justice of New Zealand are still accorded the style Right Honourable, but without membership of the Council. Until the late 20th century, the Prime Ministers and Chief Justices of Canada and Australia were also appointed Privy Counsellors. Canada also has its own <b>Privy</b> <b>Council,</b> the Queen's <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> for Canada (see below). Prime Ministers of some other Commonwealth countries that retain the Queen as their sovereign continue to be sworn of the Council.|$|E
5|$|Cornfoot's {{murder was}} {{investigated}} {{by members of}} the aristocracy appointed by the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> two weeks after the killing. Subsequently four men were held in custody and charges were to be brought against the burgh bailie. The release of the four accused men was authorised by Patrick Cowper, the local minister, who had been involved with the initial witchcraft allegations and the torture and confinement of the alleged witches. Despite instructions from the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> that another committee should look into the events, no suspects were ever prosecuted for the murder.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the members}} have no {{automatic}} right to attend all <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> meetings, and only some are summoned regularly to meetings (in {{practice at the}} Prime Minister's discretion).|$|E
50|$|Newfoundland and Labrador's present-day {{boundaries}} were finalized as {{a result}} of the British <b>Privy</b> <b>Council's</b> decision in the Labrador Boundary Dispute of 1927, to cede much of inland Labrador to the Dominion of Newfoundland rather than to the Canadian province of Quebec.|$|R

5|$|The Drapier's second letter, A Letter to Mr. Harding the Printer, upon Occasion of a Paragraph in his News-Paper of 1 August, {{relating}} to Mr. Wood's Half-Pence, was printed on 4 August 1724, {{in response to}} the British <b>Privy</b> <b>Council's</b> testing of Wood's coin.|$|R
5|$|Individuals {{can choose}} to resign, {{sometimes}} to avoid expulsion: three members voluntarily left the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> in the 20th century: Jonathan Aitken, on 25 June 1997 following allegations of perjury; John Profumo, who resigned on 26 June 1963; and John Stonehouse, who resigned on 17 August 1976. On 4 February 2013, Chris Huhne {{announced that he would}} voluntarily leave the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice.|$|E
5|$|Madzimbamuto petitioned for {{the right}} to appeal against his {{detention}} to the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> in London; the Rhodesian Appellate Division ruled that he had no right to do so, but the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> considered his case anyway. It ruled in his favour on 23 July 1968, deciding that orders for detention made by the Rhodesian government were invalid regardless of whether they were under the 1961 or 1965 constitution, and that Madzimbamuto was illegally detained. Harry Elinder Davies, one of the Rhodesian judges, announced on 8 August that the Rhodesian courts would not consider this ruling binding as they no longer accepted the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> as part of the Rhodesian judicial hierarchy. Justice JR Dendy Young resigned in protest at Davies's ruling on 12 August and four days later became Chief Justice of Botswana. Madzimbamuto would remain in prison until 1974.|$|E
5|$|Members of the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> are {{privileged to}} be given advance notice of any prime ministerial {{decision}} to commit HM Armed Forces in enemy action.|$|E
50|$|However, {{given the}} <b>Privy</b> <b>Council's</b> rulings in Citizen's Insurance Co. v.

50|$|Sir Thomas, was privy purse to Charles II {{and one of}} the <b>privy</b> <b>councils</b> to James II, and {{following}} the fortunes of James went into exile with him, dying in France on 8 January 1694. He was buried at Rouen. Sir Thomas was succeeded by his eldest son Walter.|$|R
5|$|On 6 May 1970, Stewart {{suggested}} to Wilson {{that they should}} formally advise the Queen to remove Beadle from the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council.</b> Wilson resolved to {{wait until after the}} British general election the following month. This decision proved decisive for Beadle as, to the surprise of many, the Conservatives won the election, and Edward Heath replaced Wilson as Prime Minister. Heath's government decided against removing Beadle from the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council,</b> surmising that this would only hinder progress towards an accommodation with Smith. Beadle remained a Privy Counsellor {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Other suits {{were brought}} against Pleydell in later life. In 1587 {{he was to}} appear before the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> for {{mediation}} in an unclear suit initiated by his successor to the Wootton Bassett seat, Sir Henry Knyvet, now knighted. He is listed as living in Towcester, Northamptonshire for the Kynvet proceedings, possibly related to a family tie with the Saunders of nearby Syresham. In July 1590 a clerk of the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> registered Pleydell as having returned indefinitely to the estate in Midgehall.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the World War I, he became the subject of anti-German attacks in the Press. In 1915, Speyer offered to resign from the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> and to {{relinquish}} his baronetcy, but the Prime Minister turned down the offer. He resigned as chairman of the UERL and went to the United States. In 1921, the British government investigated accusations that Speyer had traded with the enemy during the war, and had participated in other wartime conduct incompatible with his status as a British subject. Speyer denied the charges, but his naturalisation was revoked and he was struck off the list of members of the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E

50|$|This Act is infelicitously named. It united the English and Scottish <b>Privy</b> <b>Councils</b> and decentralised Scottish {{administration}} by appointing justices of {{the peace}} in each shire to carry out administration. In effect it took the day-to-day government of Scotland {{out of the hands}} of politicians and into those of the College of Justice.|$|R
5|$|British {{political}} institutions include the Westminster system, the Commonwealth of Nations and <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> of the United Kingdom. Although the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> {{is primarily a}} British institution, officials from other Commonwealth realms are also appointed to the body. The most notable continuing instance is the Prime Minister of New Zealand, its senior politicians, Chief Justice and Court of Appeal judges are conventionally made Privy Counsellors, as the prime ministers and chief justices of Canada and Australia used to be. Prime Ministers of Commonwealth countries which retain the British monarch as their sovereign continue to be sworn as Privy Counsellors.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{judicial}} {{functions are}} also {{performed by the}} Queen-in-Council, although in practice its actual work of hearing and deciding upon cases is carried out day-to-day by the Judicial Committee of the <b>Privy</b> <b>Council.</b> The Judicial Committee consists of senior judges appointed as Privy Counsellors: predominantly Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and senior judges from the Commonwealth. The <b>Privy</b> <b>Council</b> formerly acted as the High Court of Appeal for the entire British Empire (other than for the United Kingdom itself), and continues to hear appeals from the Crown Dependencies, the British Overseas Territories, and some independent Commonwealth states.|$|E
