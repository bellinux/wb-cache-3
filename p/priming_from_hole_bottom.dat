The mechanism of sulfuric glomeration and adsorption were investigated and the tendency of sulfuric distribution was analyzed in wellbore, critical gas velocity and sulfur particle mechanical models were established. The results indicate that liquid bridge force, which is produced by the effects of water film between sulfur particles, is the main cause of sulfur glomeration. At the beginning of sour gas reservoir development, when borehole pressure is lower than saturation pressure, the distribution of precipitated sulfur and critical velocity of carrying sulfur are increasing <b>from</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> to well head.

40|$|Abstract: There {{are lots}} of cleats, {{fractures}} and many other structure weak planes in coal seams, which make the bullet holes and cleats intersecting. During the hydraulic fracturing process in coal seams, fractures will initiate at coal rock body of borehole wall, and cleats or fractures are different from conventional reservoirs. Thus a new model for initiation pressure calculation during coal seams fracturing should be established. Based on the rock mechanics and elasticity mechanics, and also on network distribution characteristics of coal seam cleats and the space position relationships between the intersected bullet holes and cleats, stress distribution around the bullet holes and at the cleats wall were deducted. The model was established in tensile failure condition. The calculated initiation fracture pressure of Well HX- 3 was 10. 71 MPa.

40|$|Temperatures in four {{geothermal}} aquifers, inyan Kara (Cretaceous), Mission Canyon (Mississippian), Duperow (Devonian), and Red River (Ordovician) are in {{the range}} for low and moderate temperature geothermal resources within an area of about 130, 000 km{sup 2 } in North Dakota. The accessible resource base is 13, 500 x 10 {sup 18 } J., which, assuming a recovery factor of 0. 001, may represent a greater quantity of recoverable energy than is present in the basin in the form of petroleum. A synthesis of heat flow, thermal conductivity, and stratigraphic data was found to be significantly more accurate in determining formation temperatures than the use of linear temperature gradients derived <b>from</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> temperature data. The thermal structure of the Williston Basin is determined by the thermal conductivities of four principal lithologies: Tertiary silts and sands (1. 6 W/m/K), Mesozoic shales (1. 2 W/m/K), Paleozoic limestones (3. 2 W/m/K), and Paleozoic dolomites (3. 5 W/m/K).

40|$|At present, the State of Vermont has not {{completed}} a thorough {{survey of the}} geothermal resources of its shallow subsurface. The lack of investigation is partly because the bedrock of Vermont is generally understood to be old, thick, and tectonically inactive, and thus “cold”. Furthermore, a proper geothermal survey often relies {{on the existence of}} many deep, open wells <b>from</b> which <b>Bottom</b> <b>Hole</b> Temperatures (BHTs) can be collected and amassed to create a summary of geothermal potential (Shope et al., 2012). Deep, open wells are often the product of oil and gas exploration, which is practically absent in Vermont and makes such a large-scale survey impossible. Over the past two years, Jon Kim of the Vermont Geological Survey and Ed Romanowicz of SUNY-Plattsburgh have collected high quality temperature data from 18 bedrock wells in Vermont. Though not as extensive, the Vermont data can be seen as more accurate for each location than BHT data because the entire well is surveyed and analyzed for temperature uctuations.

40|$|In the past, {{the oil and}} gas {{industry}} has typically used the single gradient system to drill wells offshore. With this system the <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> pressure was controlled by a mud column extending from the drilling rig to the bottom of the wellbore. This mud column was used to achieve the required <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> pressure. But, as the demand for oil and gas increased, the industry started exploring for oil and gas in deep waters. Because of the narrow margin between the pore and fracture pressures it is somewhat difficult to reach total depth with the single gradient system. This led to the invention of the dual gradient system. In the dual gradient method, heavy density fluid runs <b>from</b> the <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> to the mudline and a low density fluid from the mudline to the rig floor so as to maintain the <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> pressure. Several methods have been developed to achieve the dual gradient drilling principle. For this research project, we paid more attention to the liquid lift, dual gradient drilling (riser dilution method). This method of achieving dual gradient drilling was somewhat different from the others, because it does not utilize elaborate equipment and no major changes are made on the existing drilling rigs. In this thesis the technical feasibility of using the liquid lift method over the other methods of achieving dual gradient drilling was determined. A computer program was developed to simulate the wellbore hydraulics under static and dynamic conditions, injection rate and base fluid density required to dilute the riser fluid and finally, u-tubing phenomena. In this thesis we also identified some problems associated with the liquid lift method and recommendations were made on how these problems can be eliminated or reduced. Emphases were placed on the effect of u-tubing, injection rate of base fluid at the bottom of the riser and well control issues facing this system...|$|R

Fertiliser was applied at sowing by placing fertiliser granules {{at a depth of}} 4  cm below the soil surface (2  cm below the seed).

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{wireless}} data telemetry used by oil industry uses compressional acoustic waves to transmit downhole information <b>from</b> the <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> to the surface. Unfortunately, acoustic echoes and drilling vibration noises in periodic drillstring {{are a major}} issue in transmission performance. A combined acoustic echo and noise suppression method based on wave motion characteristic in drillstring is adopted to enhance an upward-going transmitted acoustic signal. The presented scheme consists of a primary acoustic echo canceller using an array of two accelerometers for dealing with the downward-going noises and a secondary acoustic insulation structure for restraining the upward-going vibration noises. Furthermore, the secondary acoustic insulation structure exhibits a banded and dispersive spectral structure because of periodic groove configuration. By using a finite-differential algorithm for the one-dimensional propagation of longitudinal waves, acoustic receiving characteristics of transmitted signals are simulated with additive Gaussian noise in a periodic pipe structure of limited length to investigate the effects on transmission performance optimization. The results reveal that the proposed scheme can achieve a much lower error bit ratio over a specified acoustic isolation frequency range with a 30 – 40 [*]dB reduction in the average noise level compared to traditional single-receiver scheme...|$|R

40|$|An {{effective}} drilled cuttings lifting <b>from</b> the <b>bottom</b> <b>hole</b> to {{the surface}} improves drilling performance. The transportation of drilled cuttings becomes more challenging when drilling a high angle or horizontal well. A sufficiently high annular mud velocity is essential to prevent drilled cuttings from settling and forming stationary beds on the low side of a hole. This can cause several drilling problems such as high torque and drag, stuck pipe, etc. This problem has been addressed via an experimental work which studied the effect of annular mud velocities on drilled cuttings removal using water-based mud with polypropylene beads in vertical, deviated, and horizontal holes. It was accomplished using a 3. 96 m long flow loop which comprised 50. 8 mm transparent acrylic section with a simulated drill string. The annular mud velocity was varied from 0. 27 in/s to 1. 06 m/s at ambient condition. The experimental results showed that increase in annular mud velocity has improved hole cleaning, i. e., cuttings transport ratio experienced an improved performance in the turbulent flow than in laminar flow. The findings further demonstrated {{that the presence of}} polypropylene beads in water-based mud has contributed positively to the performance of drilled cuttings lifting in a vertical hole by 9 % in a turbulent flow...|$|R
