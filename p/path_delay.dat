40|$|This paper investigates {{downlink}} channel estimation in frequency-division duplex (FDD) -based massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. To {{reduce the}} overhead of downlink channel estimation and uplink feedback in FDD systems, cascaded precoding {{has been used}} in massive MIMO such that only a low-dimensional effective channel needs to be estimated and fed back. On the other hand, traditional channel estimations can hardly achieve the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) performance due to lack of the a priori knowledge of the channels. In this paper, we design and analyze a strategy for downlink channel estimation based on the parametric model in massive MIMO with cascaded precoding. For a parametric model, channel frequency responses are expressed using the <b>path</b> <b>delays</b> and the associated complex amplitudes. The <b>path</b> <b>delays</b> of uplink channels are first estimated and quantized at the base station, then fed forward to the user equipment (UE) through a dedicated feedforward link.
