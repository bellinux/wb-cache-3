25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{is a type}} of a {{compressor}} that increases the pressure of the air flowing through it. The blades of the axial flow fans force air to move <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> about which the blades rotate. In other words, the flow is axially in and axially out, linearly, hence their name. The design priorities in an axial fan revolve around the design of the propeller that creates the pressure difference and hence the suction force that retains the flow across the fan. The main components that need to be studied in the designing of the propeller include the number of blades and the design of each blade. Their applications include propellers in aircraft, helicopters, hovercraft, ships and hydrofoils. They are also used in wind tunnels and cooling towers. If the propeller is exercising propulsion, then efficiency is the only parameter of interest and other parameters like power required and flow rate are considered of no interest. In case the propeller is used as a fan, the parameters of interest includes power, flow rate, pressure rise and efficiency.|$|E

60|$|By {{looking to}} {{the next two or}} three {{succeeding}} secondary wing-feathers, an absolutely insensible gradation can be traced from one of the above-described lower spots, together with the next higher one in the same row, to a curious ornament, which cannot be called an ocellus, and which I will name, from the want of a better term, an “elliptic ornament.” These are shewn in the accompanying figure (fig. 58). We here see several oblique rows, A, B, C, D (see the lettered diagram), &c., of dark spots of the usual character. Each row of spots runs down to and is connected with one of the elliptic ornaments, in exactly the same manner as each stripe in fig. 56 runs down to, and is connected with, one of the ball-and-socket ocelli. Looking to any one row, for instance, B, the lowest spot or mark (b) is thicker and considerably longer than the upper spots, and has its left extremity pointed and curved upwards. This black mark is abruptly bordered on its upper side by a rather broad space of richly-shaded tints, beginning with a narrow brown zone, which passes into orange, and this into a pale leaden tint, with the end towards the shaft much paler. This mark corresponds in every respect with the larger, shaded spot, described in the last paragraph (fig. 57), but is more highly developed and more brightly coloured. To the right and above this spot (b), with its bright shading, there is a long, narrow, black mark (c), belonging to the same row, and which is arched a little downwards so as to face (b). It is also narrowly edged on the lower side with a fulvous tint. To the left of and above c, in the same oblique direction, but always more or less distinct from it, there is another black mark (d). This mark is generally sub-triangular and irregular in shape, but in the one lettered in the diagram is unusually narrow, elongated, and regular. It apparently consists of a lateral and broken prolongation of the mark (c), as I infer from traces of similar prolongations from the succeeding upper spots; but I do not feel sure of this. These three marks, b, c, and d, with the intervening bright shades, form together the so-called elliptic ornament. These ornaments stand in a line <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft,</b> and manifestly correspond in position with the ball-and-socket ocelli. Their extremely elegant appearance cannot be appreciated in the drawing, as the orange and leaden tints, contrasting so well with the black marks, cannot be shewn.|$|E

L-shaped handles for pianos are available in several angles that are not quite right angles, provide greater leverage than T-shaped handles, and the angle provides clearance for the handle over adjacent pins, allowing a very short (and stiff) socket to be used. A short, stiff socket enables a better feel {{and control of the}} tiny movements of the tuning pin, within the pin-block. T-shaped handles are used for many lower-tension instruments such as the harpsichord, harp, and dulcimer.

40|$|The {{study of}} lithic {{armatures}} of Riparo Dalmeri {{was aimed at}} the reconstruction of hunting equipment and hunting strategies implemented by the epigravettian human groups who attended the northeastern Italy during the Lateglacial. The lithic armatures analyzed, come from the three main stratigraphical levels of the shelter, whose radiocarbon refer to the Lateglacial interstadial and more precisely to the passage between Bölling and Alleröd. And just in correspondence of climatic and environmental changes that define this chronological stage, {{that there is a}} gradual and profound alteration of lithic production systems and conceptual schemes to their base. Nevertheless, the techno-functional analysis conducted on lithic armatures revealed a substantial chronological continuity of the morpho-dimensional objectives sought: the simplification of the production system is expressed essentially in the transfer of a large part of technical investment from the production phase of the bladelets to that of transformation in armatures. The analysis of the residues of manufacture and the characteristics of backs allowed us to define the percussion with the stone on anvil as the main retouching technique used, associated with the pressure by antler especially during the first phase of attendance of the shelter. According to the morphological and dimensional variability, the backed points were divided into three main typological classes while for the backed bladelets with double truncations has been noticed a greater research of standardization. The evaluation of diagnostic traces of impact identified on the armatures of each class has allowed us to put forward a first hypothesis on how the armatures were fixed and employed in the various stratigraphical levels. The experimental activity, carried out subsequently {{to the study of the}} findings, has largely confirmed this reconstruction, suggesting also new diagnostic elements for the identification of the mode of association of the microliths on the shaft. Unlike the highlighted for the lithic production, the configuration of weapons is consistent in the first two levels of attendance while denotes an evident change in correspondence of the last stage of settlement dated at the end of the Alleröd. Initially, the engagement of the backed points occurred within a recess dug laterally to the shaft so as to expose the entire cutting edge opposite to the back; in direct contact with the piercing element were also inserted two backed bladelets with double truncations, positioned <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> so as to form a single cutting edge with the margin of the tip. On the other hand, as regards the last level of attendance, the revision of the functional data after the experimentation, rather opt for a tip insertion within a fork axial, and its association with several baked bladelets with double truncations inserted in groups of two, obliquely to the dynamic axis of the arrow. The attestation of a predominant use of composite weapons, is connected to the search for greater efficiency in terms of ballistic penetration of animal tissues, and corresponding to the evidence found for the epipalaeolithic complexes of Europe. The change in the pattern of hunting projectiles, certificated for the occupation levels of the second part of the Lateglacial interstadial, it seems to be due to the advantage offered by the second type of arrangement in terms of maintainability and durability of the functional life of the weapon. The experimental confirmation of the use of these armatures associated with the bow-arrow system, is connected to the deep changes that are involved in hunting strategies and more generally in the mobility of lateglacial human groups: It seems likely that the search for weapons characterized by a rapid production and an equally quick retooling is linked to practices of hunting less structured in the territory and involving the frequent loss of projectiles. It therefore follows that attending repeated and prolonged of Riparo Dalmeri is closely related to specialized ibex hunting, which represents more than 90...|$|E

It is shown that both machines have a potential power/weight ratio of twice that of the radial machine. For the induction motor and reluctance motor maximum outputs of 1260 watts and 1100 watts were obtained respectively in a frame size of 220 mm O/D and 110 mm long. The limitations of the prototype machines are discussed and the relationship between the reluctance motor performance and the principal machine parameters is obtained...|$|R
50|$|The Kyosho Optima Mid was <b>the</b> {{first car}} <b>to</b> utilize a {{mid-mounted}} motor in 1987, it was amongst <b>the</b> few brands <b>to</b> experiment {{with this type}} of drivetrain.As their Frog and Hotshots became obsolete over the years and Tamiya was in desperate need to create a serious competition car against the Yokomos and Kyoshos, they evolved the competition buggy formula further when they introduced the Taki designed Avante in 1988. The car was revolutionary as it featured a number of aluminum and fibre-reinforced plastic parts with a in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plastics its competitors were offering, with its of stiffness and near-infinite adjustability. It was <b>the</b> first car <b>to</b> have its mid-motor mounted <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre drive <b>shaft</b> Designed to compete in its only race it was designed <b>to</b> do <b>the</b> 1988 JMRCA All-Japan Off-Road 4WD Championship where it finished 7th by Yoshiaki Sugiyama, this meant it became unsuited to other tracks as the aluminum parts were too soft and broke regularly, the front suspension bottomed out with alarming regularity and the handling was below par to other cars.|$|R
