40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report {{is to provide a}} topical {{reference}} on the phenomena and prediction of uranium <b>pyrophoricity</b> for the Hanford Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Project with specific applications to SNF Project processes and situations. Spent metallic uranium nuclear fuel is currently stored underwater at the K basins in the Hanford 100 area, and planned processing steps include: (1) At the basins, cleaning and placing fuel elements and scrap into stainless steel multi-canister overpacks (MCOs) holding about 6 MT of fuel apiece; (2) At nearby cold vacuum drying (CVD) stations, draining, vacuum drying, and mechanically sealing the MCOs; (3) Shipping the MCOs to the Canister Storage Building (CSB) on the 200 Area plateau; and (4) Welding shut and placing the MCOs for interim (40 year) dry storage in closed CSB storage tubes cooled by natural air circulation through the surrounding vault. Damaged fuel elements have exposed and corroded fuel surfaces, which can exothermically react with water vapor and oxygen during normal process steps and in off-normal situations, A key process safety concern is the rate of reaction of damaged fuel and the potential for self-sustaining or runaway reactions, also known as uranium fires or fuel ignition. Uranium metal and one of its corrosion products, uranium hydride, are potentially pyrophoric materials. Dangers of <b>pyrophoricity</b> of uranium and its hydride have long been known in the U. S. Department of Energy (Atomic Energy Commission/DOE) complex and will be discussed more below; it is sufficient here to note that there are numerous documented instances of uranium fires during normal operations. The motivation for this work is to place the safety of the present process in proper perspective given past operational experience. Steps in development of such a perspective are: (1) Description of underlying physical causes for runaway reactions, (2) Modeling physical processes to explain runaway reactions, (3) Validation of the method against experimental data, (4) Application of the method to plausibly explain operational experience, and (5) Application of the method to present process steps to demonstrate process safety and margin. Essentially, the logic above is used to demonstrate that runaway reactions cannot occur during normal SNF Project process steps, and to illustrate the depth of the technical basis for such a conclusion. Some off-normal conditions are identified here that could potentially lead to runaway reactions. However, this document is not intended to provide an exhaustive analysis of such cases. In summary, this report provides a ''toolkit'' of models and approaches for analysis of <b>pyrophoricity</b> safety issues at Hanford, and the technical basis for the recommended approaches.

40|$|Both dry {{reforming}} {{of methane}} (DRM) and low-temperature water-gas shift (LT-WGS) processes {{can be integrated}} into a fuel cell plant and are utilised {{for the production of}} hydrogen as an important energy source for fuel cells. Improvement of current catalytic systems, and identification and development of alternative catalysts for DRM and LT-WGS reactions have formed the basis of this study. In the first stage of the work, the influence of WO 3 on a Pt/CeO 2 catalyst was investigated for the dry reforming of methane. It was found that Pt/CeO 2 catalysts loaded with WO 3 at 10 mol% to 20 mol% were very stable during 20 hours of dry reforming of methane operation in comparison to a commercial Ni catalyst. However further addition of WO 3 (> 70 %) promoted coking on the Pt/CeO 2 sample, ultimately leading to catalyst deactivation. It was also desirable to develop catalysts with higher activity to reduce operating cost, thus the physicochemical properties of different materials were assessed to identify parameters important for LT-WGS activity. Copper catalysts on metal oxide support (CeO 2, ZnO, TiO 2, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, ZrO 2, MgO and SnO 2) were screened, while characterisation showed the catalyst adsorbing H 2 O and CO was crucial in generating LT-WGS activity, with Cu/ZnO attaining the highest LT-WGS activity. Lanthanum (La) was known to have high affinity for H 2 O, hence the effects of La doping on Cu/ZnO catalysts for use in LT-WGS reaction was investigated. The findings indicated the La promoter improved activity at a loading of 2. 3 wt%, above which the activity significantly decreased. A systematic investigation has also been conducted on the effects of oxygen introduction on the Cu-based and Pt-based catalysts during LT-WGS operation with particular attention on the <b>pyrophoricity</b> (i. e. vulnerability to oxidative sintering) of the catalysts, and the impacts on key material characteristics. The objective was to examine whether the catalysts were suitable for fuel cell applications. It was observed that the Cu-based catalysts were pyrophoric and therefore not a suitable catalyst. No <b>pyrophoricity</b> was observed for Pt-based catalysts.

The waste forms were ceramics whose compression strength was twice that of conventional cement grout and whose connected porosity was 50 % that of cement grout. Both surrogate and actual waste forms displayed high leaching resistance for both hazardous metals and Pu.
