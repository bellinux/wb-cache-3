40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteochondral {{autologous}} transplantation {{is used for}} the treatment of full-thickness articular cartilage lesions of a joint. Press-fit stability is an important factor for good survival of the transplanted <b>plugs.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS: 36 <b>plugs</b> of three different lengths were transplanted in fresh-frozen human knees. On one condyle, 3 <b>plugs</b> were exactly matched to the depth of the recipient site ("bottomed" <b>plugs)</b> and on the opposite condyle 3 <b>plugs</b> were 5 mm shorter than the depth of the recipient site ("unbottomed" <b>plugs).</b> <b>Plugs</b> were left protruding and then pushed in until flush, and then to 2 mm below flush level, using a loading apparatus. RESULTS: Longer <b>plugs</b> needed higher forces to begin displacement. At flush level, bottomed <b>plugs</b> needed significantly higher forces than unbottomed <b>plugs</b> to become displaced below flush level (mean forces of 404 N and 131 N, respectively). Shorter bottomed <b>plugs</b> required higher forces than longer bottomed ones. INTERPRETATION: Bottomed <b>plugs</b> generally provide much more stability than unbottomed ones. Short bottomed <b>plugs</b> are more stable than long bottomed <b>plugs.</b> Thus, in clinical practice it is advisable to use short bottomed <b>plugs.</b> If, however, unbottomed <b>plugs</b> are still chosen, the longer the <b>plug</b> the higher the resulting stability will be because of higher frictional forces...|$|R
2500|$|A {{conversion}} <b>plug</b> is {{a special}} type of <b>plug</b> suitable for the connection of non-BS1363 type <b>plugs</b> (to a recognized standard) toBS 1363 sockets. [...] An example would be Class 2 appliances from mainland Europe which are fitted with moulded europlugs. [...] Similar converters are available {{for a variety of}} other <b>plug</b> types. [...] Unlike a temporary travel adaptor, conversion <b>plugs,</b> when closed, resemble normal <b>plugs,</b> although larger and squarer. The non-BS1363 <b>plug</b> is inserted into the contacts, and the hinged body of the conversion <b>plug</b> is closed and fixed shut to grip the <b>plug.</b> [...] There must be an accessible fuse. Conversion <b>plugs</b> may be non-reusable (permanently closed) or reusable, in which case it must be impossible to open the conversion <b>plug</b> without using a tool.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were <b>plugged</b> at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works. The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.|$|E

5|$|The Rhodes piano (also {{known as}} the Fender Rhodes piano or simply Fender Rhodes or Rhodes) is an {{electric}} piano invented by Harold Rhodes, which became particularly popular throughout the 1970s.

5|$|The Vanport flood {{induced changes}} to the slough's system of levees, which were rebuilt {{and in some cases}} {{fortified}} to withstand a 100-year flood. Instead of repairing the levee along the Peninsula Canal, the city <b>plugged</b> it at both ends. The disaster also affected Oregon's system of higher education. After floodwaters destroyed the Vanport Extension Center, set up in 1946, the Oregon Board of Higher Education reestablished the school in downtown Portland, where it eventually became Portland State University.|$|E
40|$|Friction Pull <b>Plug</b> Welding (FPPW) is a {{solid state}} repair process for defects up to one inch in length, only {{requiring}} single sided tooling (OSL) for usage on flight hardware. Experimental data {{has shown that the}} mass of <b>plug</b> heat sink remaining above the top of the plate surface after a weld is completed (the <b>plug</b> heat sink) affects the bonding at the <b>plug</b> top. A minimized heat sink ensures complete bonding of the <b>plug</b> to the plate at the <b>plug</b> top. However, with a minimal heat sink three major problems can arise, the entire <b>plug</b> could be pulled through the plate hole, the central portion of the <b>plug</b> could be separated along grain boundaries, or the <b>plug</b> top hat can be separated from the body. The Chamfered Heat Sink Pull <b>Plug</b> Design allows for complete bonding along the ISL interface through an outside diameter minimal mass heat sink, while maintaining enough central mass in the <b>plug</b> to prevent <b>plug</b> pull through, central separation, and <b>plug</b> top hat separation...|$|R

5|$|With few exceptions, Jack {{displayed}} a continued partiality towards amps and pedals from the 1960s. Jack used {{a number of}} effects to create his sound, such as a DigiTech Whammy IV to reach pitches that would be otherwise impossible with a regular guitar. When performing live, Jack used a Randy Parsons custom guitar, a 1964 JB Hutto Montgomery Airline, a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s Crestwood Astral II, and a 1950s Kay Hollowbody. Also, while playing live, he used an MXR Micro-Amp, Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi distortion/sustainer, and an Electro-Harmonix POG (a polyphonic octave generator). He also used a Boss TU-2 tuner pedal. He <b>plugged</b> this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb, and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 1485 amplifiers paired with two 6x10 Silvertone cabinets. In addition to standard guitar tuning, Jack also used several open tunings.|$|E
5|$|After {{eliminating}} an Austrian army {{during the}} Ulm Campaign, French forces seized Vienna in November 1805. The Austrians avoided further conflict until {{the arrival of}} the Russians bolstered Allied numbers. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so he could feign a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near Austerlitz. He deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps <b>plugged</b> the gap left by Napoleon just in time. Meanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened the allied center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process.|$|E
