Franz Kafka and Prague, which was first shown in Barcelona in 1999, moved to the Jewish Museum in New York City, and was finally established in 2005 in Prague in Malá Strana (Lesser Town), along the Moldau. The museum calls its display of original photos and documents Město K. Franz Kafka a <b>Praha</b> (City K. Kafka and Prague) and aims to immerse the visitor into {{the world in which}} Kafka lived and about which he wrote.|$|E

25|$|Metro M1 {{has served}} on line C since 2000; it {{completely}} replaced older cars on this line in 2003. The metro sets were developed specially for Prague. Prague Transport Company (DPP) owns 53 units of this type. These units were manufactured in Prague by a consortium consisting of ČKD <b>Praha,</b> ADtranz and Siemens (during the contract Siemens acquired ČKD <b>Praha)</b> mainly between 2000 and 2003. The length of the unit is 96.66 metres, acceleration is 1.3m/s, and {{the capacity of the}} set is 1,464 people (224 sitting, 1,240 standing). This unit was also adapted for use in Venezuela on the Maracaibo Metro.|$|E

25|$|Another {{derivation}} of {{the name}} <b>Praha</b> is suggested from na prazě, the original term for the shale hillside rock upon which the original castle was built. At that time, the castle was surrounded by forests, covering the nine hills of the future city– the Old Town {{on the opposite side}} of the river, as well as the Lesser Town beneath the existing castle, appeared only later.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{the tournament}} became European. Lukko from Finland left, and was {{replaced}} by fellow Nordic team Vålerenga from Norway. Adler Mannheim and Eisbären Berlin from Germany, and Czech team Sparta <b>Praha,</b> completed the Capital Division; while Austrian team Red Bull Salzburg, along with SC Bern and ZSC Lions from Switzerland, completed the Central Division. These new teams prompted the changing of the tournament name to European Trophy.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Sasaki wrote {{a script}} for {{independent}} film production, Cinema Nesance, about the friendship {{of the poet}} Chūya Nakahara and the critic Hideo Kobayashi.

25|$|The 2013 European Trophy was {{the fourth}} European Trophy, an {{annually}} held European ice hockey tournament. It was also the eighth tournament since its predecessor, the Nordic Trophy, was launched in 2006. The regulation round began on 6 August 2013 with the South Division game between Piráti Chomutov–Sparta <b>Praha,</b> and ended on 8 September 2013.

25|$|Many English {{names for}} foreign places have been {{directly}} taken {{over from the}} French version, sometimes unchanged, such as Cologne, Rome, Munich, Naples, sometimes only slightly changed, like Vienna (Vienne), Venice (Venise), Lisbon (Lisbonne), Seville (Séville). The English city-name for the Czech capital, Prague (<b>Praha),</b> is taken with spelling unaltered from the French name for the city, itself descended from the Latin name for the city (Praga), which had been borrowed from an earlier Czech name (pre-dating the /g/>/h/ shift).|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} of En Canot are undocumented. However, Metzinger's painting is portrayed {{in a variety}} of black and white photographs shot between 1914 and 1930, and from one film recorded at the 1937 Degenerate Art Exhibition. Two of these images show the work hanging next to paintings of known dimension. The earliest is a photograph taken in Prague, 1914, published in the magazine Zlatá <b>Praha,</b> where the painting is seen hanging next to Metzinger’s La Femme à l'Éventail (Woman with a Fan), 1913, oil on canvas, , Art Institute of Chicago.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, now {{well-established}} anglicised names, {{whatever their}} origin, {{have remained in}} common use {{where there is no}} national pride at stake. This is the case with Ghent (Gent, or Gand), Munich (München), Cologne (Köln), Vienna (Wien), Naples (Napoli), Rome (Roma), Milan (Milano), Athens (Αθήνα, Athina), Moscow (Москва, Moskva), Saint Petersburg (Санкт-Петербург, Sankt-Peterburg), Warsaw (Warszawa), Prague (<b>Praha),</b> Bucharest (Bucureşti), Belgrade (Београд, Beograd), Lisbon (Lisboa), and other European cities whose names have been familiar in their anglicised forms for centuries. However, the present local names sometimes appear as alternatives on maps, and in public places (airports, road signs).|$|E
25|$|The 2012 {{edition of}} the tournament is {{expanded}} further by eight teams, {{for a total of}} 32 teams. Another Swedish team, Brynäs IF joins the tournament this year; Switzerland returns with four teams; another two German teams participate; and another team from Finland joins the tournament. The regulation round is played in July–November, while the playoffs were played in December. Slavia <b>Praha,</b> however, announced on 31 May 2012 that they would be pulling out of the European Trophy. On 18 June it was announced that Piráti Chomutov had taken over Slavia Praha's spot in the South Division.|$|E
25|$|During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Chara {{agreed to}} play for HC Lev <b>Praha</b> of the KHL until NHL play resumed. He {{returned}} from the lockout to post another solid season, with seven goals and 12 assists in the 48-game season. His point totals were down due to some of Boston's struggles down the stretch, particularly on the power play, where Chára only posted one assist all season despite plenty of ice time in man advantage situations. However, he remained solid on defense and a key contributor for the Bruins. In the 2013 playoffs, he was physically dominant and {{played a key role}} in leading his team to the Finals.|$|E
25|$|In many places, {{religious}} parades {{and popular}} festivals {{are held to}} celebrate this day. In Canada, Assumption Day is the Fête Nationale of the Acadians, of whom she is the patron saint. Some businesses close on that day in heavily francophone parts of New Brunswick, Canada. The Virgin Assumed in Heaven is also patroness of the Maltese Islands and her feast, celebrated on 15 August, apart from being a public holiday in Malta is also celebrated with great solemnity in the local churches especially in the seven localities known as the Seba' Santa Marijiet. The hamlet of <b>Praha,</b> Texas holds a festival during which its population swells from approximately 25 to 5000 people.|$|E
25|$|Despite good European form, Palermo was {{not able}} to keep up its form in the league; Delneri was {{consequently}} fired on January 2006 following a 2-1 home defeat to Siena and Giuseppe Papadopulo was appointed to replace him. He made his debut at the helm of Palermo with a sensational 3-0 win to AC Milan in the Coppa Italia quarter-final return leg, taking Palermo through to the semi-final round {{for the third time in}} its history; they eventually went out to AS Roma on away goals rule, the score being 2-2 on aggregate. Palermo was also eliminated from European by FC Schalke 04 in a 3-1 aggregate loss, after having defeated SK Slavia <b>Praha</b> in the round of 32. Palermo ended the season in eighth place, and thus was expected to play the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup. However, due to the Serie A scandal of 2006, the FIGC stated they would not enter Palermo into the Intertoto Cup. In the meanwhile, Francesco Guidolin left AS Monaco to re-join Palermo at Papadopulo's place.|$|E
25|$|The 1928 season {{commenced}} on 21 May, {{seeing the}} route reduced to three weekly {{services and the}} southern terminus of the route moved to Travemünde outside Lübeck. This allowed for {{the introduction of the}} larger ten-passenger Rohrbach Ro V Rocco aircraft. It made only seven flights, the last on 16 June, before it was taken out of service as the airline deemed it unsuitable. From 20 June the service was flown using a Dornier Do R Superwal, the first service used by the new class of aircraft. The 1939 season lasted from 21 May to 31 August, and was served using Dornier Wals and Superwals. From 1930 a daily service was again introduced. The number of connections from Lübeck increased, featuring Berlin, <b>Praha,</b> Vienna and Paris. By then the annual ridership had increased to 935. Patronage fell in 1931 to 774 and to 582 the following year. Deutsche Luft Hansa widened its season in 1933 to encompass services from 1 May to 30 September, allowing ridership to increase to 1,230. From 1934 the airline introduced Junkers Ju-52 aircraft and recorded 2,387 passengers.|$|E
500|$|That year, Yorke {{formed a}} new band to perform The Eraser live, Atoms for Peace, with musicians {{including}} Godrich and Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea; {{the band played}} eight North American shows in 2010. In January 2010, Radiohead played their only full concert {{of the year in}} the Los Angeles Henry Fonda Theater as a benefit for Oxfam. Tickets were auctioned, raising over half a million US dollars for the NGO's 2010 Haiti earthquake relief. In June, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a surprise set at Glastonbury Festival, performing Eraser and Radiohead songs. On 30 August, Selway released his debut solo album, Familial. In September 2010, Radiohead released the soundboard recording of their 2009 Prague performance for use in a fan-made concert video, Live in <b>Praha.</b> In December, a fan-made video of Radiohead's Oxfam benefit performance, Radiohead for Haiti, was released via YouTube and torrent with Radiohead's support and a [...] "pay-what-you-want" [...] link to donate to Oxfam. The videos were described as examples of the band's openness to fans and positivity toward non-commercial internet distribution.|$|E
