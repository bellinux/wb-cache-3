5|$|Overall {{construction}} headquarters was at Fort Wainwright near Fairbanks, where Alyeska {{leased land}} and buildings from the U.S. Army. Vacant barracks were converted into housing, and vacant offices were given to oil workers. As air traffic increased, Alyeska arranged {{for the use of}} Fort Wainwright's airfield to relieve the burden on Fairbanks International Airport. The camp at Wainwright {{was the only one that}} did not use <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings.</b>|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of its deployment, the first contingent focused most of its efforts on providing accommodations for electoral centres and police stations. These were typically manned by {{only two or three}} police (or civilian) electoral staff and were almost always in small, remote villages. Buildings were leased, a large number of caravans purchased and deployed and <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings</b> constructed in about 50 locations. Much of this was done by the Resources Troop (under Lieutenant Stuart Graham), centrally controlled by squadron construction officer Captain Shane Miller.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Clifton High School was {{relocated}} to the property, and in 1941 the U.S. Army Medical Corps established a facility for wounded soldiers, {{known as the}} 74th General Hospital, in the estate grounds. The construction of this temporary tented village resulted in the US Army Engineers breaching what was then England's longest holly hedge. With many tents later replaced by <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings</b> and some nissen huts, {{at one point in}} the war following D-Day it became the largest US Army hospital in Europe. During the hostilities, management of the estate's farmland was assumed by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), leaving Lady Wraxall only the Home Farm.|$|E

25|$|The {{timing of}} Virgin Blue's {{entry into the}} Australian market was {{fortunate}} as {{it was able to}} fill the vacuum created by the failure of Ansett Australia in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at Sydney Airport however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there—a collection of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings</b> without aerobridges—longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of 737-700 and -800 series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Rossall had made plans to accommodate Westminster School however these plans were scrapped when the government requisitioned the campus for several departments of the Office of Works, the Board of Education and the Ministry of Pensions. As a result, the school moved to Naworth Castle. The government departments put up <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings</b> and found other premises close by as soon as possible, and left in 1940. The school returned and took in a school from the south-east, as the Westminster School had found an alternative solution. The eventual choice was that of Alleyn's who had to be evacuated from London {{as a result of the}} risk of bombing. Another side effect of the war was that there was only one centenary dinner celebrating the 100th year of Rossall. It was conducted by Old Rossallians imprisoned in Changi Prison, a notorious POW camp in Singapore during the Japanese occupation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Prefabricated</b> <b>building</b> {{systems are}} once again gaining popularity. The new {{prefabricated}} paradigm offers the integration of several approaches previously ignored: automated manufacturing, integrated building services and environmental sustainable principles. Consistency, predictable environmental control, modular flexibility, quick assembly and affordability are promising features of modern manufactured construction. Though the concept of <b>prefabricated</b> <b>building</b> is not new, this type of construction {{may be the only}} hope in obtaining a truely sustainable architecture for our future. This paper attempts to define and evaluate several <b>prefabricated</b> <b>building</b> systems, ranging from a ‘kit-of-parts’ to fully assembled ‘volumetric’ modules. It aims to categorise various manufactured types among a vast amount of information, and to observe their attributes regarding materials, flexibility, structural integrity, delivery and constructability. This paper suggests that pre-fabricated architecture can deliver high order design and diversity within the framework of waste reduction, renewable systems integration and optimal performance. <br /...|$|R

2500|$|Lewisham Council have rebutted {{claims that}} the houses have {{historical}} significance and have maintained {{that it would be}} [...] "virtually impossible to bring them up to modern standards, a view shared by a number of residents, who are mainly council tenants." [...] The council have repeatedly argued that residents favour redevelopment; citing a recent poll amongst residents in which 56 percent voted in favour of redevelopment. [...] Conservationists have argued this result was inevitable as residents felt there was very little prospect of the council spending any money on their homes, leaving them in outdated accommodation. [...] Of the estate Lewisham Council stated [...] "We have a responsibility under the national Decent Homes programme to bring all its housing up to a recognised standard. [...] It simply is not financially viable to refurbish the estate." [...] Of the listing, Steve Bullock said. [...] "The listing by English Heritage was perverse and it has made me extremely concerned about the way that organisation behaves… These are temporary <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings,</b> not architectural gems" ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout East Sussex, few {{original}} libraries {{survive in}} use. [...] In Brighton and Hove, only Hove's central library (1907–08, by Leeds architects Percy Robinson and W. Alban Jones) remains with little alteration. The [...] "highly inventive" [...] Edwardian Baroque design features a domed upper storey and a rotunda at the rear. [...] The façade has egg-and-dart moulding. Brighton's central library {{used to be}} in the early-19th-century complex of buildings designed by William Porden, which later became Brighton Museum & Art Gallery. [...] Distinguished by excellent interior tiling, it had long been too small but was not replaced until Jubilee Library opened in February 2005. Bennetts Associates and Lomax, Cassidy & Edwards designed the [...] "carefully wrought but nonetheless striking" [...] building—a highly glazed [...] "box" [...] with a prominent brise soleil and side elevations laid with dark blue tiles resembling mathematical tiles. As the main element in the regeneration of North Laine, it has been called [...] "the most important public building constructed in Brighton since the Royal Pavilion". Portslade Library, built in 1964, was [...] "a typical Sixties creation" [...] with little regard for disabled access: it was built on a sloping site, and steps lead down from the road to the entrance. [...] Its Modernist design drew comparison locally with Sputnik. Hangleton's library (opened in 1962, although Hove Borough Surveyor T.R. Humble's plans date from 1958) is integrated into a residential building, and the same applies at Coldean. [...] The Archadia firm of architects designed a ground-floor library of [...] with six housing association flats above, in which the windows are emphasised by panels of pale brick. The complex opened in June 2008, replacing the original library of 1975. Moulsecoomb library was designed by Percy Billington in 1964; its large roof seems to [...] "float" [...] as it overhangs the small single-storey structure. Other modern libraries include Patcham (1933; extended in 2003), Westdene (1964) and Woodingdean (1959), for which planning permission to demolish and rebuild on a larger scale to include a doctor's surgery was sought in 2012. Rottingdean's library is housed in the former vicarage, Saltdean's is part of Saltdean Lido, and Hollingbury library occupies the former County Oak pub (1950) which was made up of two <b>prefabricated</b> <b>buildings.</b>|$|E
