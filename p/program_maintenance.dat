40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to introduce a multi-year pavement <b>maintenance</b> <b>programming</b> methodology that can explicitly account for uncertainty in pavement deterioration. This is accomplished with the development of a simulation-based genetic algorithm (GA) approach that is capable of planning the maintenance activities over a multi-year planning period. A stochastic simulation is used to simulate the uncertainty of future pavement conditions based on the calibrated deterioration model while GA is used to handle the combinatorial nature of the network-level pavement <b>maintenance</b> <b>programming.</b> The effects of the uncertainty of pavement deterioration on the <b>maintenance</b> <b>program</b> are investigated using a case study. The results show that <b>programming</b> the <b>maintenance</b> activities using only the expected pavement conditions is likely to underestimate the required maintenance budget and overestimate the performance of pavement network. ...|$|R

Many traditional visualizations of software structure require a great deal of screen real estate, preventing the programmer from viewing the entire structure at once, and increasing the difficulty of navigating and understanding the information space. In addition, specialized software displays can pose a barrier to tool adoption when they require additional training, and show poor integration with existing tools. The prototype tool (JavaZoom) uses the Continuous Zoom interface to allow focus+context displays of the complete software structure.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsAllen M. FeatherstoneAs the U. S. {{economy has}} changed, {{the use of}} diesel {{vehicles}} has increased. With this increase, has come {{an increase in the}} demand of highly trained technicians to work on those vehicles. North Arkansas College of Harrison, AR is looking for opportunities to keep its program offerings current with the educational demands of its potential students. During the last few years, North Arkansas College has received requests to start a diesel vehicle <b>maintenance</b> <b>program.</b> This thesis analyzes the feasibility of a diesel vehicle <b>maintenance</b> <b>program</b> at North Arkansas College. To determine the feasibility of such a program, all major aspects of the potential program must be considered and analyzed. The key questions addressed are: what is the interest level in the community for a diesel vehicle <b>maintenance</b> <b>program,</b> what are the major capital costs of starting the program, what would the potential operating budget resemble, and how would the program fit into the current field of area diesel <b>maintenance</b> <b>programs?</b> To study the feasibility of a potential diesel vehicle <b>maintenance</b> <b>program</b> at North Arkansas College, four steps were completed. First, a survey was developed that measured the interest from potential students, prospective employers, and interested community members from the potential market of North Arkansas College. Second, research was done to understand how a potential diesel vehicle <b>maintenance</b> <b>program</b> would fit into the current marketplace of established diesel <b>maintenance</b> <b>programs.</b> This was done by researching and comparing area programs to the type of programs that North Arkansas College offers and the possible model of a potential diesel vehicle <b>maintenance</b> <b>program.</b> Next, research was conducted to estimate the capital costs of starting a diesel vehicle <b>maintenance</b> <b>program,</b> as well as the potential operating budget. This was done by developing blueprints of a potential floor plan, a building to house the program, and the potential areas of study in the program. Based on these blueprints, actual bids and estimates were collected to calculate potential capital and operating costs. Finally, analysis was conducted to determine if the outcomes of a potential diesel vehicle <b>maintenance</b> <b>program</b> would fulfill the mission of North Arkansas College. The analysis of the feasibility of a diesel vehicle <b>maintenance</b> <b>program</b> at North Arkansas College reveals that there is interest from all three parts of the community in starting a diesel vehicle <b>maintenance</b> <b>program.</b> The research also revealed that the program would be a fit in the marketplace if it was an affordable, three semester program that covered the basics of the diesel powered vehicle. Also, research of the potential costs and revenues of the program reveals that the program would be sustainable. Finally, a diesel vehicle <b>maintenance</b> <b>program</b> would have much synergy with the current programs already offered at North Arkansas College. In the end, the results suggest that it is worthwhile to move forward towards starting a diesel vehicle <b>maintenance</b> <b>program...</b>|$|R

40|$|Program slicing is {{a program}} {{transformation}} that is useful in program debugging, <b>program</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and other applications that involve understanding program behavior. Given a program point p {{and a set of}} variables V, the goal of slicing is to create a projection of the program (by eliminating some statements), such that the projection and the original program compute the same values for all variables in V at point p. This paper addresses the problem of slicing programs with arbitrary control flow. Previous slicing algorithms do not always form semantically correct program projections when applied to such programs. We present an algorithm for slicing programs with complex control flow and a proof of its correctness. Our algorithm works for programs with completely arbitrary control flow, including irreducible control flow. 1.

We developed an object role-based approach which deals with these requirements. ...|$|E
