When {{her room}} was searched later, campus police {{discovered}} {{most of her}} belongings <b>packed</b> in boxes and the art removed from the walls. It's not clear whether Murray <b>packed</b> them that day, but police at the time asserted she'd <b>packed</b> between Sunday night and Monday morning. On top of the boxes was a printed email to Murray's boyfriend indicating trouble in their relationship. Around 3:30 pm, she drove off the campus in her black 1996 Saturn sedan; classes at the university had been canceled that day due to a snowstorm.|$|E

5|$|The Hershey brothers, Jacob, Isaac, John, Paris, and Eli, founded Hershey Creamery Company in 1894, {{with the}} company {{originally}} operating out of the Hershey family's Lancaster County farmhouse.

Salesmen traveled daily routes to deliver product to customers in the county and in surrounding areas.|$|E
50|$|A <b>packing</b> {{density or}} <b>packing</b> {{fraction}} of a <b>packing</b> in some space is the fraction of the space filled by the figures making up the <b>packing.</b> In <b>packing</b> problems, the objective is usually to obtain a <b>packing</b> of the greatest possible density.|$|R

5|$|The soil is {{moistened}} {{so it will}} compact into {{a stable}} structure when <b>packed</b> into woven polypropylene or burlap sacks or tubes. Plastic mesh is sometimes used. Polypropylene (pp) sacks are most common, since they are durable when covered, cheap, and widely available.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of exoplanets {{have been}} {{identified}} in the last twenty years. The orbits of many of these planets and systems of planets differ significantly from the planets in the Solar System.

50|$|The {{two major}} ice <b>packs</b> are the Arctic ice <b>pack</b> and the Antarctic ice <b>pack.</b> The most {{important}} areas of <b>pack</b> ice are the polar ice <b>packs</b> formed from seawater in the Earth's polar regions: the Arctic ice <b>pack</b> of the Arctic Ocean and the Antarctic ice <b>pack</b> of the Southern Ocean. Polar <b>packs</b> significantly change their size during seasonal {{changes of the}} year. Because of vast amounts of water added to or removed from the oceans and atmosphere, the behavior of polar ice <b>packs</b> has {{a significant impact on}} global changes in climate.|$|R

40|$|A {{system and}} method for high speed data {{recording}} includes a control {{computer and a}} disk <b>pack</b> unit. The disk <b>pack</b> is provided within a shell that provides handling and protection for the disk <b>packs.</b> The disk <b>pack</b> unit provides cooling of the disks and connection for power and disk signaling. A standard connection is provided between the control computer and the disk <b>pack</b> unit. The disk <b>pack</b> units are self sufficient and able to connect to any computer. Multiple disk <b>packs</b> are connected simultaneously to the system, so that one disk <b>pack</b> can be active while one or more disk <b>packs</b> are inactive. To control for power surges, the power to each disk <b>pack</b> is controlled programmatically for the group of disks in a disk <b>pack...</b>|$|R
5|$|About 45–50 {{days after}} hatching, the chicks form a crèche, huddling {{together}} for warmth and protection. During this time, both parents forage at sea and return periodically {{to feed their}} chicks. A crèche may comprise up to several thousand birds densely <b>packed</b> together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely <b>packed</b> retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E
5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Kingdom of Madagascar, the French colonial authorities shifted the location of these tombs thereby disrupting the original cosmological symbolism of their arrangement. When the original tombs were excavated for relocation, the French found the mortal remains of the nobles within had each been wrapped in numerous traditional lambas (woven silk cloths) then set within wooden coffins <b>packed</b> with charcoal. Bodies buried at Ambohimanga were found to have been entombed in the same way.|$|E
50|$|Year <b>Packs</b> - These {{are also}} known as Gift <b>Packs</b> and Collectors <b>Packs.</b> The first Year <b>Pack,</b> {{originally}} called Gift <b>Pack,</b> was issued {{at the end of}} 1967 and contained that year's stamps. The Royal cypher, embossed in gold {{on the cover of the}} <b>pack</b> made this striking new addition to the GPO product range. In 1968, a Gift <b>Pack</b> was produced containing the commemorative stamps issued between January and August that year. Strangely, the GPO also created a Collectors <b>Pack,</b> which contained selected stamp issues from 1967 and 1968. From 1969 to 1971, they continued to produce Collectors <b>Packs</b> containing selected stamps from two years. However, since 1972 <b>packs</b> have been issued with only one year's stamps. The name changed to Year <b>Pack</b> in 1994.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of nasal <b>packing,</b> {{anterior}} nasal <b>packing</b> and posterior nasal <b>packing.</b> There are a number of different types of anterior nasal <b>packs.</b> Some use gauze and others use balloons. Posterior <b>packing</b> can be achieved by using a Foley catheter, blowing up the balloon when it is {{in the back of the}} throat, and applying traction. Ribbon gauze or Merocel <b>packing</b> can also be used. [...] There are also several dissolvable <b>packing</b> materials, such as surgicel that function as a <b>pack</b> but are not removed and dissolve after a few days. <b>Packing</b> is generally left in for two to five days.|$|R

5|$|Argon {{is used to}} {{displace}} oxygen- and moisture-containing air in packaging material to extend the shelf-lives of the contents (argon has the European food additive code E938). Aerial oxidation, hydrolysis, and other chemical reactions that degrade the products are retarded or prevented entirely. High-purity chemicals and pharmaceuticals are sometimes <b>packed</b> and sealed in argon.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of erosion of {{sandstone}} and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys. The tightly <b>packed</b> lakes in the narrow valleys are long and narrow, and they orient from the east to west. The cliffs in these narrow valleys are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a sub-Arctic climate. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by a thick diabase cap.|$|E
