25|$|More than 100 student {{clubs and}} organisations {{operate on the}} {{university}} campus. These include numerous student government, service providers, and service organisations. The most prominent amongst these are the Student Parliament, Student Representative Council, and Constitutional Tribunal (Student Court). The Student Parliament is the plenary body of student governance and determines the wider mandate for student governance. The Student Representative Council (SRC) is the executive body of student governance and subsequently charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. The SRC is the residential student government, specialising in <b>programming,</b> <b>policy,</b> and facilities and services. Societies are registered in the following categories as catering for religious, political, social, cultural, academic and other. The Constitutional Tribunal is the judicial body of student governance and adjudicates disputes primarily between student organisations. Its judges sit on the panel of student disciplinary hearings. The various service providers are the university’s primary programming organisations, serving as a centre of social, cultural, intellectual and recreational life.|$|E

5000|$|WKDU's musical {{format is}} free-form, meaning that playlists are {{dictated}} by {{the taste of the}} on-air DJs. On an average day, one might hear punk, electronica, indie rock, acid jazz, J-pop or metal. In 1984, a progressive requirement was created and implemented to the Free Format music <b>programming</b> <b>policy</b> by then Music Director, Ginny McCracken. Each DJ can play whatever they want but at least 1/3 of their music must be a [...] "new release". A [...] "new release" [...] being defined as a musical recording single song in the station one month and an album of music in the station for 3 months. The top 40 playlist was then determined by the most played new releases, anarchically determined instead of the traditional music director dictatorship.

Its <b>programming</b> <b>policy</b> is concentratively set on presenting 2 categories of classical musicians; famed top stars or gifted top rookies. For this reason, TIMF's concert model is structured in a symmetrical compatibility between experimental performances to introduce young players and big-scale projects run by globally recognized orchestras, chamber ensembles, soloists or operatic productions. The following shows the artists staged in TIMF's history complying with these 2 categories.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this brief is to {{summarize}} {{the wide range of}} federal <b>programs</b> and government <b>policies</b> that influence the employment and program participation decisions of people with disabilities and current research initiatives related to these <b>programs</b> and <b>policies.</b> The brief is organized by the following types of <b>programs,</b> <b>policies,</b> and initiatives: •	federal programs that provide cash assistance, in-kind transfers (e. g., health insurance) and education, training, and rehabilitation support based on disability status and/or other characteristics (e. g., family structure); •	federal tax policies that provide credits either directly to individuals with disabilities or to employers as an incentive to hire a person with a disability; •	other employment-related <b>programs</b> and public <b>policies</b> that provide accommodation support and work incentives for people with disabilities; •	recent policy changes that affect people with disabilities; and •	some of the current research initiatives related to federal <b>programs,</b> tax <b>policies,</b> other employment <b>programs</b> and <b>policies,</b> and recent policy changes.
