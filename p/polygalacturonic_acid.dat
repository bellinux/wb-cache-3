The results demonstrated that polysaccharides, in particular alginic acid, had complexing properties and effects on Pb bioaccumulation by the green alga Chlorella kesslerii that were similar to equivalent complexing capacity of humic substances. Pb uptake decreased {{in the presence of}} humic, alginic, and <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acids</b> with respect to noncomplexed Pb, but accumulated Pb was higher than predicted from measured Pb 2 + concentrations or from previous results obtained in the presence of simple synthetic ligands. An improved fit between experimental observations and Pb speciation was obtained by taking into account the formation of a ternary complex at the algal surface. The contribution of the ternary complexes to Pb bioaccumulation was dependent on the relative binding constants of the Pb to the NOM and to the binding sites on the biological surface. In the presence of the humic acid, a decreased surface charge and increased membrane permeability were considered to be of secondary importance to explain the observation of increased Pb uptake with respect to that predicted on the basis of [Pb 2 +].

40|$|Sporamin and β-amylase are {{two major}} {{proteins}} of tuberous storage root of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and their accumulation can be induced concomitantly with the accumulation of starch in leaves and petioles by sucrose (K Nakamura, M Ohto, N Yoshida, K Nakamura [1991] Plant Physiol 96 : 902 - 909). Although mechanical wounding of leaves of sweet potato only occasionally induced the expression of sporamin and β-amylase genes, their expression could be reproducibly induced in leaf-petiole cuttings when these explants were dipped in a solution of <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> or chitosan at their cut edges. <b>Polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> seemed to induce expression of the same genes coding for sporamin and β-amylase that are induced by sucrose.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{occurrence of}} sites contaminated with toxic metals {{and the associated}} high costs of remediating them using chemical and mechanical methods have led to calls to develop inexpensive and sustainable approaches based {{on the use of}} plants that naturally accumulate large amounts of metals in their tissues. The ability of plants to remediate metals has been rigorously studied and some species have been identified as excellent phytoremediators. However, the growth of phytoremediators is often retarded under high soil metal concentrations, rendering them ineffective. Meanwhile, some plants do not have remediating abilities but are capable of growing in contaminated environments with little or no sign of stress. Despite the volume of research dedicated to the screening and evaluation of phytoremediators, major questions remain about why some plants survive but do not remediate while the growth of phytoremediators is mostly hindered. The growth and metal-remediating efficiency of plants exposed to toxic concentrations of metals can be enhanced by inoculating phytoremediating plants with certain bacteria but the mechanisms behind this process remain unclear. Furthermore, the use of leguminous plants to improve the growth of a target plant under a mixed planting system has long been recognised as an effective yield-enhancing cropping system. However, the possibility of a non-remediating but tolerant leguminous plant conferring metal tolerance to a phytoremediator has not been explored. This thesis reports results from repeated glasshouse and lab-based growth experiments on the phytoremediating plant Brassica juncea exposed to 400 – 600 mg Zn kg- 1. The aim was to investigate the abilities of two plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) species Pseudomonas brassicacearum and Rhizobium leguminosarum, and a leguminous plant Vicia sativa to promote B. juncea growth and enhance remediation of Zn-contaminated soil. B. juncea plant roots were analysed using synchrotron based micro-focus X-ray Fluorescence (μXRF) imaging and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (μXANES) analysis to probe Zn speciation. P. brassicacearum exhibited the poorest plant growth promoting ability, while R. leguminosarum alone and in combination with P. brassicacearum significantly enhanced B. juncea growth and Zn bioaccumulation. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) analysis showed that reduced plant growth was due to root accumulation of Zn as Zn sulphate, Zn oxalate and Zn <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acids.</b> The better growth and increased metal accumulation observed in plants inoculated with R. leguminosarum and its combination with P. brassicacearum was attributed to root storage of Zn in the chelated forms of Zn phytate and Zn cysteine. A subcellular analysis of plant root also showed that the PGPB enhanced tolerance to Zn contamination by enhancing epidermal Zn compartmentalisation depending on the nature of root colonization, and induced changes in Zn speciation to less toxic Zn species in the epidermis and endodermis of plant root. The thesis therefore identifies enhanced Zn compartmentalization at the root epidermis and bacterial mediated changes in Zn toxicity through changes in Zn speciation as key complimentary mechanisms of plant growth promotion and enhanced Zn accumulation in plants by PGPB. Further experiments investigating alternative phytoremediation strategies showed that the use of the leguminous plant V. sativa in a mixed planting system with B. juncea plants completely out performed the effects of bacteria in promoting the growth and remediation potential of B. juncea under Zn contamination. By combining PGPB with mixed planting, B. juncea recovered full growth while also achieving maximum phytoremediation efficiency. The novel legume assistedmicrobial phytoremediation method that is reported in this thesis is the first to demonstrate complete plant growth recovery in plants exposed to 400 – 450 mg kg- 1 soil Zn contamination for 5 weeks. Survival of V. sativa was attributed to its root storage of Zn in the chelated forms of Zn histidine and cysteine whereas in the roots of stunted B. juncea plants the majority of Zn was present as Zn oxalate and toxic Zn sulphate. Although the use of natural and synthetic chelates has been reported to enhance phytoremediation, this thesis recommends a legume-assisted-microbialphytoremediation system as a more sustainable method for Zn bioremediation...|$|R
40|$|Pectin {{has been}} {{identified}} as a critical structural component of plant cell walls contributing to tissue integrity and rigidity. As a result, this polysaccharide strongly determines the textural/rheological quality of fruit- and vegetable-based products. Pectins functional properties depend on its molecular fine structure, which can be altered enzymatically as well as non-enzymatically. Several modifications in pectin structure occur during food processing, rendering pectin a major point of interest for food technologists seeking to tailor the textural/rheological properties of plant-based food products. So far, the process-structure-function relation of pectin in food matrices has predominantly been investigated via the physicochemical analysis of isolated cell-wall material with the consequent loss of most spatial information. Today, monoclonal anti-pectin antibodies, originally generated in the context of plant cell wall biology, provide a new range of opportunities as they allow the precise localisation of defined structural pectic domains in intact cell walls in plant tissues. Antibodies binding to the homogalacturonan (HG) domain of pectin are of particular interest for food technologists as HG in general and its degree of methyl-esterification (DM) in particular strongly determine the functionality of pectin in food matrices. The current study aimed at the implementation of these anti-HG antibodies in an integrated methodological approach in order to unravel the structure-function relation of pectin during processing of plant-based foods. In a first step, the potential of the anti-HG antibodies to investigate the effect of processing on pectin in fruits and vegetables was explored. Specifically, the binding specificity of these probes towards pectins and methoxylated <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acids</b> with defined degree and pattern of methyl-esterification was determined via immuno-dot assays and, moreover, a microscopic method to use these monoclonal antibodies in situ in plant-based food systems was developed and implemented. Subsequently, four different case studies (on broccoli tissue, broccoli purée, carrot purée and tomato suspensions) were performed in which the traditional physicochemical analysis of isolated cell-wall material was combined with the ex situ and in situ application of anti-HG antibodies to acquire in-depth insight into the process-structure-function relations of pectin. Broccoli, carrot and tomato were subjected to various thermal, high-pressure and mechanical treatments changing pectins structure and, hence, its functional properties. Thermal processing of broccoli and carrot was demonstrated to result in a thermosolubilisation and ß-eliminative depolymerisation of pectin. The induced weakening of the intercellular adhesion could be related to texture softening of broccoli tissue, whereas syneresis phenomena were limited in broccoli and carrot purées. In situ visualisation of pectin with anti-HG antibodies JIM 7 and LM 20 showed that, after thermal processing, highly methyl-esterified, water-soluble pectic polymers became detached and loosely bound to the cell wall. Conversely, pretreatments stimulating the endogenous pectin methylesterase (PME) activity were shown to cause a decrease in the DM of pectin and, correspondingly, an increase in Ca 2 +-cross-linked pectin at the expense of loosely bound water-soluble pectin. The resulting stronger intercellular adhesion could be linked to a reduced texture degradation during subsequent thermal processing of broccoli tissue and a higher resistance of broccoli and carrot tissue to physical disintegration during purée preparation. For carrot, this alteration in pectin structure was reflected in a purée with a high consistency and a large degree of separation between serum and pulp. Anti-HG antibody PAM 1 revealed that process-induced pectin demethoxylation by endogenous PME mainly took place at the tricellular junctions of adjacent cells in broccoli and at discrete regions of the inner face of the cell wall adjacent to the plasma membrane in carrot. In tomato, process-induced pectin changes did not only depend on the activity of PME, but also on the activity of the depolymerising enzyme polygalacturonase (PG). In case PG was selectively inactivated, i. e. in high-pressure pretreated tomatoes, de-esterification of pectin by PME also resulted in a high level of Ca 2 +-cross-linked pectin and a stronger intercellular adhesion, similar as in broccoli and carrot. Immunolabeling showed that in intact tomato fruit, pectin de-esterification was endogenously regulated by the physical restriction of PME activity in the cell wall matrix, whereas in disintegrated tomato tissue intensive demethoxylation of pectin could occur throughout the entire cell wall. Finally, high-pressure homogenisation, an intense shear treatment used for tissue disruption, affected pectin solubility depending on the plant matrix. This thesis shows that anti-HG antibodies are valuable tools in elucidating the process-structure-function relations of pectin in food matrices by providing the opportunity to explore local changes in pectin structure in situ. The obtained results form a sound basis to control the textural/rheological properties of plant-based food products and to identify targets for food-structure engineering. nrpages: 143 status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Recently, EPSs {{have great}} {{potential}} as antitumor drug, as recent treatment strategies showed limitations of severe {{side effects and}} multidrug resistance occurred (Romanenko et al. 2008). Marine microbes {{have turned out to}} be well known and novel sources of EPSs, albeit numerous known marine bacteria can produce EPSs. Few of them are of biotechnological significance, so the search of EPSs that may have imaginative applications is still of potential intrigue (Casillo et al. 2018). While trying to get the marine bacterial strains, we separated from various areas and assessed based on the productivity of the EPSs. From the 20 marine EPSs, the promising IC 50 of 11 EPSs (M 1, M 3, M 6, M 15, M 19, E 2, E 4, E 10, S 5, S 7, and S 11) were 524.0, 549.0, 562.0, 501.0, 309.0, 537.0, 630.9, 549.0, 436.0, 389.0, and 407.0 [*]μg/mL, individually. However, the remaining EPSs showed moderate anti-proliferative activities (Table  2). A few polysaccharides significantly inhibit the development of malignancy cells as illustrated by Huang (2013), while other polysaccharides demonstrated different functions. For instance, the polysaccharides from Ganoderma lucidum fundamentally decreased tumor cells in vitro (Zhao et al. 2010); on the other hand, polysaccharide from Pleurotus sp. mycelium demonstrated its antioxidant activities in vitro (Liu et al. 2010). Marine bacterial strain GWS-BW-H 8 hM was accounted for to hinder development of gastric cell line (HM 02), liver cell line (HepG 2), and bosom cell line (MCF 7) (Bitzer et al. 2006). EPSs and sulfated polysaccharides from Halomonas stenophila sp. repressing hypersaline condition have likewise been accounted for their pro-apoptotic effects for T-leukemia cells (Ruiz-Ruiz et al. 2011; Xu et al. 2014). These show that MGA 2, MSA 1, E 4, SGA 3, and NRC 7 are acidic sulfated heteropolysaccharides. MGA 2, MSA 1, E 4, SGA 3, and NRC 7 are comprised of different monosaccharides including glucose, mannose, galactose, glucouronic acid, and mannouronic acid. A lot of marine bacteria are encompassed by EPSs, which may help bacterial groups to endure extremes of saltiness, temperature, and nutrient availability (Casillo et al. 2018). In view of the chemical and rheological properties of the EPSs generated by these bacteria, examinations were performed to test their potential applications in biotechnology and ecological protection (Nichols et al. 2005; Guezennec 2002). The item and nature of bacterial EPSs are exceptionally affected by the biological and dietary status (Kumar et al. 2007). Most EPSs created by marine microbes are heteropolysaccharides containing diverse unit of monosugars coordinated in a range of around 10 to compose repeating units (Decho 1990). For the most part, EPSs are straight, with molecular weight from 1 to 3 [*]×[*] 105 [*]Da (Sutherland 1977). Numerous EPSs are neutral molecules, but the greater parts are polyanionic for the SO 3 −, PO 4 −, and uronic acid presence. The physical properties of EPSs are incredibly influenced by the method for the monosugars arranged and the accumulation of the one polymer chain (Vanhooren and Vandamme 1998). Biological activities of EPSs are depending on its chemical structure and the molecular weight. The presence of rate sugars as ribose and arabinose besides the uronic acid in the order of <b>polygalacturonic,</b> glucouronic, galacturonic <b>acid,</b> and polymers of low molecular weight are important indicators reflecting the antioxidant activity of the EPSs (Roca et al. 2015). Furthermore, in the FTIR spectrum of MGA 2, MSA 1, E 4, SGA 3, and NRC 7, the characteristic band at 929 [*]cm− 1 belonged to the β-anomeric configuration in MGA 2, SGA 3, and NRC 7 (Synytsya et al. 2003; Zhbankov et al. 1997), and the band at 840 [*]cm− 1 was ascribed to α-pyranoses in the MSA 1 and E 4 (Park 1971). Besides, absorption at 1271 [*]cm− 1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of S=O indicating MGA 2, MSA 1, E 4, SGA 3, and NRC 7 were sulfated polysaccharides (Percival and Wold 1963).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} a plant-derived polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) on the activity of endopolygalacturonases isolated from fungi. PGIP's effect on endopolygalacturonases is to enhance the production of oligogalacturonides that are active as elicitors of phytoalexin (antibiotic) accumulation and other defense reactions in plants. Only oligogalacturonides with a degree of polymerization higher than nine are able to elicit phytoalexin synthesis in soybean cotyledons. In the absence of PGIP, a 1 -minute exposure of <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> to endopolygalacturonase resulted in the production of elicitor-active oligogalacturonides. However, the enzyme depolymerized essentially all of the <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> substrate to elicitor-inactive oligogalacturonides within 15 minutes. When the digestion of <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> was carried out with the same amount of enzyme but in the presence of excess PGIP, the rate of production of elicitor-active oligogalacturonides was dramatically altered. The amount of elicitor-active oligogalacturonide steadily increased for 24 hours. It was only after about 48 hours that the enzyme converted the <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> into short, elicitor-inactive oligomers. PGIP is a specific, reversible, saturable, high-affinity receptor for endopolygalacturonase. Formation of the PGIP-endopolygalacturonase complex results in increased concentrations of oligogalacturonides that activate plant defense responses. The interaction of the plant-derived PGIP with fungal endopolygalacturonases may be a mechanism by which plants convert endopolygalacturonase, a factor important for the virulence of pathogens, into a factor that elicits plant defense mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|The {{peak of the}} {{unspecified}} {{compound of}} quantitative analysis of organic acids in biological materials by using high-performance liquid chromatography was identified. This peak corresponded to <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid.</b> A High-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed to identify and quantify of water soluble pectin fraction and insoluble pectin fraction, galacturonic acid and <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid.</b> The method based on the extraction of free water soluble fraction with phosphate buffer (pH 4. 8) or with 0. 01 N phosphoric acid and on the acid hydrolysis of insoluble pectin fraction in presence 0. 1 N HNO 3. The pectin fractions were separated and determined on a C 610 H column using elution with 0. 01 N phosphoric acids and ultraviolet detection at 210 nm. Galacturonic acid and <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> were used as internal standard. The calibration curves were presented {{for each of the}} standards. The determinations were performed in the linear range of 0. 04 ÷ 0. 17 % w/v for both pectin fractions. Proposed procedure can considered as a rapid method for quantitative pectin determination in the food, food nutrition’s food, and pharmaceutical agents...|$|E
40|$|The soil isolate Cellvibrio mixtus UQM 2294 {{degraded}} {{a variety}} of polysaccharides including microcrystalline cellulose. Among 6, 000 cosmid clones carrying C. mixtus DNA, constructed in Escherichia coli with pHC 79, 50 expressed the ability to degrade {{one or more of}} the following substrates: carboxymethyl cellulose, chitin, pectin (<b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid),</b> cellobiose, and starch. These degradative genes are encoded in a single 94. 1 -kilobase segment of the C. mixtus genome; a preliminary order of the genes is starch hydrolysis, esculin hydrolysis, cellobiose utilization, chitin hydrolysis, carboxymethyl cellulose hydrolysis, and <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> hydrolysis. A restriction endonuclease cleavage map was constructed, and the genes for starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, cellobiose, chitin, and pectin hydrolysis were subcloned...|$|E
40|$|Six {{strains of}} {{filamentous}} fungi (Aspergillus foetidus NCIM 505, Aspergillus foetidus NCIM 510, Aspergillus foetidus NCIM 1027, Aspergillus niger NCIM 548, Aspergillus niger NCIM 616 and Aspergillus awamorii NCIM 885) were compared for {{their capacity to}} produce exo-pectinase in submerged fermentation (SMF) from a new substrate (tamarind kernel powder; TKP). Maximum pectinolytic activity was reached at 72 h of growth, the best fungal strain being A. foetidus NCIM 505. Different types of carbon sources (glucose, fructose and sucrose) both in individual (20 and 40 g L– 1) and in combined (10 g L– 1 each) form {{were used to assess}} the effect of carbon sources on the production of exo-pectinase. Commercially available purified pectin and <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> (20 g L– 1) were used to assess the effect of pectin and <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> on the production of exo-pectinase. Further, the combination of pectin and <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> (10 g L– 1 each) was used to assess the degree of production of exo-pectinase. Design-Expert was used to optimize the medium concentration (glucose, TKP, ammonium sulphate) and the response surface method was used to analyze the counter plot to enhance the production of pectinase...|$|E
30|$|Native PAGE was {{performed}} by excluding SDS and DTT from the electrophoresis protocol described above. The “sandwich” method was used to detect the activity of pectinases acting on <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> sodium salt as substrate (Manchenko 1994). Briefly, proteins were separated on a native PAGE and subsequently the gel was first incubated for 20  min in 0.1  M citrate phosphate buffer (pH  5.0) and afterwards contacted with an (solid) agar substrate containing 0.25 % (w/v) <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> sodium salt for 50  min and for 90  min at 30 °C (in 80 % humidity chamber). The agar plate was then treated with 1 % (w/v) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide which precipitated the substrate and revealed pectinase activity as translucent bands on an opaque background.|$|E
40|$|The rumen {{anaerobic}} fungus Neocallimastix frontalis {{was grown}} on cellulosic substrates, and the cellular distribution {{and types of}} glycosidases produced by the organism were studied. Fungal cultures were fractionated into extracellular, insoluble (membrane), and intracellular fractions and assayed for glycosidase activity by using Avicel, carboxymethylcellulose, xylan, starch, <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid,</b> and the p-nitrophenyl derivatives of galactose, glucose, and xylose as substrates. Enzymic activity was highest in the extracellular fraction; however, the membrane fraction also displayed appreciable activity. The intracellular fraction was inactive towards all substrates. <b>Polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> was the only substrate not hydrolyzed by the active fractions, indicating that pectinase was absent. The results show that N. frontalis, a common rumen anaerobic fungus, produces enzymes for degrading cellulose and hemicellulose, key components of plant fiber...|$|E
40|$|An alkalophilic {{bacterium}} {{was isolated}} {{based on the}} potential of extra-cellular enzymes for bioscouring. The bacterium {{was identified as a}} new strain of Bacillus pumilus BK 2 producing an extra-cellular endo-pectate lyase PL (EC 4. 2. 2. 2). PL was purified to homogeneity in three steps and has a molecular mass of 37. 3 ± 4. 8 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and an isoelectric point of pH 8. 5. Peptide mass mapping by nano-LC–MS of PL revealed 15 % homology with a pectate lyase from Bacillus sp. The pectate lyase exhibited optimum activity at pH 8. 5 and around 70 °C in Tris/HCl buffer. It showed a half-life at 30 °C of more than 75 h. Stability decreased with increasing temperature, extremely over 60 °C. The enzyme did not require Ca 2 + ions for activity, and was strongly inhibited by EDTA and Co 2 +. PL was active on <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> and esterified pectin, but the affinity showed a maximum for intermediate esterified pectins and decreased over a value of 50 % of esterification. The best substrate was 29. 5 % methylated pectin. PL cleaved <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> via a β-elimination mechanism as shown by NMR analysis. PL released unsaturated tetragalacturonic acid from citrus pectin and <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid,</b> but did not show any side activities on other hemicelluloses. On <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> PL showed a Km of 0. 24 g l− 1 and a vmax of 0. 72 g l− 1 min− 1. The applicability of pectate lyase for the bioscouring process was tested on a cotton fabric. Removal of up to 80 % of pectin was proven by means of ruthenium red dyeing and HPAEC (65 %). Structural contact angle measurements clearly indicated the increased hydrophilicity of enzyme treated fabrics...|$|E
40|$|Some {{properties}} of the polygalacturonase-elicitor from the filtrates of Rhizopus stolonifer cultures have been examined {{in an attempt to}} understand its mode of action as an elicitor of casbene synthetase activity in castor bean seedlings. Both the polygalacturonase activity and the elicitor activity are heat-labile with similar heat-sensitivity profiles. Also, the catalytic activity of the enzyme is lost on treatment with sodium periodate, as had been shown previously for the elicitor activity. The pH optimum of the enzyme activity with <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> as the substrate is 4. 9. Exposures of germinating castor bean seedlings to the elicitor for short-term periods of 1 to 10 minutes followed by washing and incubation in sterile, distilled water are partially effective in elicitation in comparison with the continuous exposure of the seedlings over 11 hours to the same amount of the elicitor. The initial rate of reaction catalyzed by the enzyme is about 3 times faster with <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> as a substrate than with partially (50 %) methylated <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> (pectin). The Km value of the enzyme for <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> is about 4. 2 millimolar in terms of monomeric units and about 0. 07 millimolar in terms of polymer concentration. Examination of the types of products formed by the action of the enzyme suggests that it is an endo-hydrolase. The amino acid composition of this enzyme is similar to those of other extracellular fungal proteins reported. The carbohydrate moiety of the glycoprotein polygalacturonase-elicitor is composed of 92 % mannose and 8 % glucosamine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The linkage group analysis of the carbohydrate moiety showed that mannosyl residues which are 1, 2 -linked comprise about 70 % of the total glycosyl residues and demonstrated the presence of some 1, 3, 6 - and 1, 2, 6 -linked branching mannosyl residues...|$|E
40|$|Partial {{hydrolysis}} of <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> with a purified α- 1, 4 -endopolygalacturonase yielded oligogalacturonides {{and trace}} amounts {{of a series}} of modified oligogalacturonides. Three of the minor products were isolated and identified as oxidized oligogalacturonides possessing termini of galactaric acid. Oxidation of indole- 3 -acetic acid by peroxidases was activated by oxidized oligogalacturonides but not by normal analogs...|$|E
40|$|Two pectinmethylesterase isoforms, PME I and PME II, {{have been}} {{separated}} and purified from persimmon using chromatography techniques. Both isoforms presented differences in molecular weight (PME I: 51 kDa, PME II: 30 kDa), isoelectric point (PME I: 8 - 4, PME II: 6 - 9) and K(m) values (PME I: 54 μg ml- 1, PME II: 31 μg ml- 1). They differed in their optimum pH and thermal stability, PME I being the more thermostable isoform. Both isoforms exhibited similar behaviour {{with respect to}} Ca 2 + and Na+ concentrations and were strongly inhibited by CaCl 2 concentrations of over 80 mM and by NaCl concentrations of over 500 mM. Both isoforms were activated by low concentrations of <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> and were competitively inhibited by D-galacturonic acid and high concentrations of <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid.</b> Comisio n Interministerial deCiencia y Tecnologi a (CICYT) (ALI 94 / 943).

40|$|Aims: To screen industrially {{important}} extracellular enzymes {{from the}} newly isolated alkalophilic bacilli and to characterize them by phenotypic and 16 S-internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA restriction pattern analysis. Methods and Results: Three different environmental samples, soil, leather and horse faeces, were collected within {{the province of}} Izmir. Isolates grown on Horikoshi-I medium for 24 h at 37 °C were screened for extracellular enzyme activity by using eight different substrates: birchwood xylan, carboxymethylcellulose, casein, citrus pectin, <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid,</b> soluble starch, and Tween 20 and 80. In total, 115 extracellular enzyme-producing bacilli were obtained. Casein was hydrolysed by 78 %, soluble starch by 67 %, citrus pectin by 63 %, <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> by 62 %, Tween 20 by 34 %, birchwood xylan by 16 %, Tween 80 by 12 %, and carboxymethylcellulose by 3 % of the isolates. The isolates were differentiated into 19 distinct homology groups by the 16 S-ITS rDNA restriction pattern analysis. Conclusions: Eight different extracellular enzyme activities were determined in 115 endospore forming bacilli. The largest 16 S-ITS rDNA homology group (HT 1) included 36 % of the isolates, 98 % of which degraded casein, <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid,</b> pectin and starch. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study is the first report on the characterization of the industrial enzyme-producing alkalophilic bacilli by 16 S-ITS rDNA {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP). Restriction profiles of 64 % of the isolates were found to be different from those of five reference strains used...|$|E
40|$|The acid-base {{properties}} of pectin {{and its ability}} to complex with copper(II) or cadmium(II) were quantitatively determined in order to define the ability of this natural polyelectrolyte to sequester metal ions. Potentiometric measurements carried out at different ionic strengths (0. 1 - 0. 7 mol L- 1, in Na+ ionic medium) allowed us to define the acid-base {{properties of}} pectin together with the dependence of the protonation constants on ionic strength and to calculate the protonation constant at infinite dilution. The formation of complex species between pectin and copper(II) or cadmium(II) was investigated potentiometrically (using H+, Cu 2 + and Cd 2 + Ion Selective Electrodes, ISEs) in NaNO 3 at 0. 1 mol L- 1 at T = 25 °C. The results thus obtained showed the formation of ML and MLH species for both the pectin-Cu 2 + / Cd 2 + systems. The acid-base properties and the complexation capacity of a commercial <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> with copper(II) and cadmium(II) ions were also investigated, <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> being the most abundant component of pectin. On the basis of the proposed complexation model, the abilities of pectin and <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> to sequester cadmium(II) and copper(II) ions were evaluated at different pH values. The data obtained on the sequestration capacity of the two ligands used here were compared with previous data for other polycarboxylic polymer systems, including alginate, polyacrylate and polymethacrylates, under the same experimental conditions...|$|E
40|$|To purify {{pectate lyase}} {{produced}} by Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora, {{we used the}} supernatant from 48 -h-old cultures grown in broth containing sodium polypectate and yeast extract. The supernatant was combined with the enzyme substrates sodium polypectate and <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid,</b> which were then precipitated with CaCl 2. After the precipitate was washed, pectate lyase was eluted with 1. 0 M NaCl...|$|E
30|$|EPG {{activity}} was qualitatively detected on plates containing 6.7 [*]g/L of YNB, 5 [*]g/L of glucose, 5 [*]g/L of <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> (Sigma), and 20 [*]g/L of bacteriological agar (Difco), with the pH adjusted to 5.4. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 72 [*]h, and the enzyme activity visualized by {{the diameter of}} the hydrolysis haloes produced after the plates had been flooded with 6 [*]M HCl (Zink and Chatterjee, [1985]). The EPG {{activity was}} measured in the culture supernatant by estimating the increase in the reducing power, using 1 % (w/v) <b>polygalacturonic</b> <b>acid</b> in 50 [*]mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) as the substrate, at 37 °C for 10 [*]min (Nelson, [1944]). A typical reaction mixture contained 400 μL of substrate and 100 μL of the appropriate supernatant dilution. One unit of EPG activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to produce 1 [*]μmol/min of galacturonic acid, or equivalent reducing power, under these conditions.|$|E
