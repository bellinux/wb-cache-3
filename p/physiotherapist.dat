40|$|There {{has been}} a {{persistent}} undersupply of <b>physiotherapists</b> in rural and remote Australia {{since at least the}} 1980 s. Addressing this undersupply will require, along with increasing the number of <b>physiotherapists</b> educated in rural and remote areas, encouraging <b>physiotherapists</b> to migrate from urban to rural areas. Addressing undersupply will also require encouraging <b>physiotherapists</b> to remain in the profession while they are living in rural and remote Australia.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study utilised the nominal group technique {{to identify a}} typology of the difficult patient in private practice physiotherapy and to determine strategies <b>physiotherapists</b> use, {{and would like to}} improve, when dealing with such patients. The two areas <b>physiotherapists</b> found most difficult to manage were behavioural problems of patients and patient expectations. Few differences were evident regarding ranking of difficult patient attributes between the experienced (n = 19) and less experienced (n = 18) <b>physiotherapists</b> except for the categories of pain and diagnosed psychological problems. While less experienced <b>physiotherapists</b> ranked the pain category highly, experienced <b>physiotherapists</b> did not identify this category. Further, more experienced <b>physiotherapists</b> specifically distinguished between patients with diagnosed psychological problems and patients with psychosocial concerns, while less experienced <b>physiotherapists</b> did not, and placed both these issues into one category.

40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluates the}} {{implementation}} and acceptability of a pain education programme delivered to <b>physiotherapists</b> in clinical practice. Methods: A pre test post test design with ten <b>physiotherapists</b> was employed. Descriptive and inferential statistics {{were used for}} outcome measure data. Focus groups were carried out with seven <b>physiotherapists</b> within one month post intervention. This data was analysed using the Framework Approach. Results: Ten musculoskeletal <b>physiotherapists</b> were recruited. It was possible to develop and deliver the intervention and this {{was found to be}} acceptable to <b>physiotherapists</b> within clinical practice. The study explored trends within outcome measures; and the outcome measures were considered to be appropriate. The focus groups yielded three interlinked themes, which related to the impact of the programme: “providing a context for pain education”, “influence on aspects of the patient-therapist encounter” and “logistics of the education programme in clinical practice”. Conclusion: A pain education programme delivered to <b>physiotherapists</b> in clinical practice was both possible to deliver and acceptable to participants. A key strength of the programme was the applicability to real life practice, and something which <b>physiotherapists</b> valued. Whilst <b>physiotherapists</b> felt pain neurophysiology education was important, <b>physiotherapists</b> reported lacking confidence in implementing their pain neurophysiology knowledge with patients. Thus more time is needed to focus on pain neurophysiology education with the aim to increasing confidence with application of this approach in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The rising {{number of}} hip arthroscopies (HA) {{is leading to}} {{increasing}} numbers of patients requiring post-surgical rehabilitation; however, evidence regarding post-operative rehabilitation is currently limited. The {{purpose of the study}} was to describe and compare current rehabilitation strategies and views among surgeons and <b>physiotherapists</b> in Scandinavia. METHODS: Scandinavian surgeons and <b>physiotherapists</b> experienced with HA and post-surgical rehabilitation were asked to complete an online survey. Ninety clinicians (28 surgeons, 62 <b>physiotherapists)</b> responded. RESULTS: Both professions mostly rated physiotherapy as very or extremely important in the rehabilitation process. The majority advocated criteria-based or combined criteria- and time-based progression. Expected rehabilitation timelines were reported with large intra-professional variation but general inter-professional agreement. However, compared with <b>physiotherapists</b> surgeons expected fewer weeks on crutches and faster return to competitive sport. Surgeons more often reported use of evidence-based self-reported outcomes while <b>physiotherapists</b> more often evaluated readiness for return to play. CONCLUSIONS: Among surgeons and <b>physiotherapists,</b> physiotherapy is considered very important following HA. Generally, very similar views were held between professions. Surgeons expected reduced time on crutches and to return to competitive sports than <b>physiotherapists.</b> Surgeons also used evidence-based self-reported outcomes to a higher degree than <b>physiotherapists.</b> Being the first study to provide an overview on currently applied rehabilitation strategies following HA, results of this study may guide much needed, future research on the rehabilitation process following HA.

Does the technology readiness differ between 4 th year physiotherapy students and qualified <b>physiotherapists?</b> 3. Does the number of years of experience affect the technology readiness of <b>physiotherapists?</b> Design: Observational study using the Technology Readiness Index (TRI). Outcome measures: Respondents rated their agreement with each statement on a 5 -point Likert scale, overall TRI scores and individual category averages were analysed. Participants: 205 respondents including 4 th year physiotherapy students and qualified <b>physiotherapists.</b> Results: Mean overall TRI score was neutral (3. 16 (0. 52)). No statistically significant differences were found regarding the overall TRI score across the sample. Students and newly qualified <b>physiotherapists</b> showed statistically significantly higher innovativeness than highly experienced <b>physiotherapists.</b> Discomfort was statistically significantly more in highly experienced <b>physiotherapists</b> than newly qualified <b>physiotherapists.</b> Students showed statistically significantly more insecurity than qualified <b>physiotherapists</b> as a whole group and specifically more than experienced <b>physiotherapists.</b> Conclusion: The neutral overall TRI score suggests that respondents are not ready for the increased use of technology in practice.

The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the job satisfaction and attrition rates of early career <b>physiotherapists</b> graduating from one Western Australian university. Methods: A self-administered online survey was conducted of 157 Notre Dame physiotherapy graduates (2006 - 2012), incorporating a job satisfaction rating scale. Results: Results showed that lowered job satisfaction was related to working in the cardiorespiratory area of physiotherapy and working in multiple jobs since graduation. The majority of graduates did not predict a long-term career in physiotherapy highlighting a lack of career progression and limited scope of practice as influential factors. Conclusions: Job satisfaction in early career <b>physiotherapists</b> varies across different clinical areas of practice related to several factors including challenge and flexibility. New roles in the profession including extended scope roles may impact on the future job satisfaction of <b>physiotherapists.</b> Further studies are needed to explore the impact of these roles on workforce trends including attrition rates. What is known about the topic? <b>Physiotherapists</b> predict careers of 10 years or less, on entry into the profession.
