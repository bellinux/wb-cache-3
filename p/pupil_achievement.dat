Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger approved Feuer's microstamping bill and his bill on DUI ticket masking on October 14, 2007, but vetoed several of Feuer's other bills, including those on nursing homes, consumer rebates, and court fees.|$|E

We applied quantitative and qualitative techniques for finding the relevant data such as interviewing and interview protocol designed for teachers, and representatives of the BDE, an analysis of pedagogical documentation, observation.

40|$|This {{research}} {{illustrates how}} pupil grouping within primary education influences their possibilities to achieve high education results. Paper aims {{to show how}} does pupils’ achievements and education interpretation are constructed and how such constructs are connected to teacher interpretation of pupils’ abilities. Analysis is concerned with micro interaction occurring in schools between teacher and pupil. Research is elaborated in interpretative perspective and based on theories of new sociology of education and grouping. To obtain information about questions analyzed several interviews with Latvian language and mathematics teachers were conducted. Afterwards several interviews were done with pupils whom interviewed teachers described as “good” or “bad”. To analyze empirical data Critical Discourse Analysis was applied. Results show that both pupils and teachers legitimize pupil grouping and groups is used to predict pupil performance. It’s also possible to conclude that pupils’ interpretation of education processes comes from interaction within school. Although there is a link between interaction and <b>pupil’s</b> <b>achievements,</b> teachers tend to explain <b>pupil</b> <b>achievements</b> through other factors...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between Teacher self- efficacy, interest, attitude, qualification, experience and pupils’ academic achievement in primary school mathematics. The participants of the study comprises of 254 primary school teachers and 120 primary school pupils. Data collected on the study were analysed using a stepwise multiple regression analysis. The results reveals that teacher self – efficacy and interest had significant correlation with <b>pupils</b> <b>achievement</b> scores. Teacher’s self-efficacy being the best predictor of pupils’ academic achievement in mathematics was followed by teacher’s interest. Attitude, qualification and experience were not significant correlation with <b>pupil’s</b> <b>achievement</b> in mathematics. The study recommended that it is high time for primary school mathematics teachers to have a change of attitude towards the teaching of the subject so that the achievement of universal basic education will not be hindered. Furthermore, primary school educational authorities were called upon to ensure that only teachers who are qualified to teach the subject are employed. Not these alone, their attention was also drawn {{to the fact that they}} should design educational programmes that will enhance the teacher self- efficacy for a better prediction of pupils’ achievement in mathematics...|$|R

To deal with these selection biases, three methods are implemented, in a comparative perspective: (1) IV regression, (2) Heckman’s two-stage approach and (3) propensity score matching. This exercise underlines important divergences between the results of parametric and nonparametric estimators. All results, however, show that private education does not generate systematic benefits...|$|R
