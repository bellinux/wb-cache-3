5|$|Relations between steppe nomads and the settled <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> around Central Asia {{were often}} marked by conflict. The nomadic {{lifestyle}} was {{well suited to}} warfare, and steppe cavalry became {{some of the most}} militarily potent forces in the world, only limited by nomads' frequent lack of internal unity. Periodically, strong leaders would organise several tribes into one force, creating an almost unstoppable power. These unified groups included the Huns, who invaded Europe, and under Attila, conducted campaigns in both eastern France and northern Italy, over 500miles apart, within two successive campaign seasons. Other unified nomadic forces included the Wu Hu attacks on China, and the Mongol conquest of much of Eurasia.|$|E
