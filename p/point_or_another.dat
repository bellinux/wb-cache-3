5|$|On the Rochester end, NY33 {{primarily}} {{serves as}} a paralleling local route to Interstate490 (I-490), of less importance to the area's traffic patterns. Between the two cities, it is mostly a rural two-lane highway. The largest location on this stretch is the Genesee County city of Batavia, where NY33 reconnects to NY5 and crosses NY63 and NY98, two regionally important north–south highways. NY33 overlaps with all three routes at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> as it traverses Batavia. A southerly alternate route, designated NY33A, leaves NY33 northeast of Batavia in Bergen and rejoins its parent in Rochester.|$|E
5000|$|Game Bonus : Once {{a player}} has {{acquired}} 100 <b>points</b> (<b>or</b> some other agreed-upon number) {{the game is}} over, and that player receives a game bonus of 100 <b>points</b> (<b>or</b> <b>another</b> agreed-upon number).|$|R
50|$|Gin hands {{normally}} {{consist of}} 10 cards. However, {{if a player}} chooses to draw so that 11 cards fit into melds, {{he or she can}} declare Big Gin in which case the player receives a Big Gin bonus of 31 <b>points</b> (<b>or</b> <b>another</b> established amount, commonly 50 points instead of the standard 31 points, depending on rule set) plus any deadwood in the opponent's hand.|$|R
50|$|Players {{alternate}} {{taking turns}} until one player ends the round by knocking, going Gin, or until only two cards {{remain in the}} stock pile, {{in which case the}} round ends in a draw and no points are awarded. The game ends when a player reaches 100 <b>or</b> more <b>points</b> (<b>or</b> <b>another</b> established amount). In tournament rules the game is played in best of five with 250 points per game.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} argued that all the {{specimens}} belong to the same species, A. lithographica. Differences do exist among the specimens, and while some researchers regard these as due to the different ages of the specimens, some may be related to actual species diversity. In particular, the Munich, Eichstätt, Solnhofen, and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth, and possible presence of a sternum. Due to these differences, most individual specimens have been given their own species name at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> The Berlin specimen has been designated as Archaeornis siemensii, the Eichstätt specimen as Jurapteryx recurva, the Munich specimen as Archaeopteryx bavarica, and the Solnhofen specimen as Wellnhoferia grandis.|$|E

25|$|Pontiac {{engineer}} Clayton Leach {{designed the}} stamped steel valvetrain rocker arm, a simplified and reliable {{alternative to a}} bearing-equipped rocker. This design was subsequently picked up by nearly every OHV engine manufacturer at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Mississippi River Gallery takes {{advantage}} of the museum's proximity to the river and a National Park to educate visitors about its natural resources. Visitors can learn about the environment and animals of the river. It is also home The Collectors' Corner. Traders (primarily children) bring in natural artifacts they have found to trade them for <b>points</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> artifact. The more information they can discuss about their item, the more points they earn.|$|R
5000|$|Big Gin : Prior to knocking, if all 11 {{cards in}} a player's hand form a legal gin, the player can retain the extra card {{as part of}} his or her hand, and is awarded 31 points plus entire count of {{deadwood}} in his or her opponent's hand. (In some rule sets players may be awarded 50 <b>points</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> established amount plus the entire count of deadwood in the opponent's hand) ...|$|R

25|$|Unlike other {{theaters in}} the city, which were stage theaters {{converted}} into movie houses at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> the Teatro Cervantes {{was a movie}} house that was converted into a stage theater. It is used for puppet shows, dance recitals, experimental theater and conferences.|$|E
25|$|Polls {{over the}} course of the {{campaign}} indicated that the race was very competitive, with many polls showing Franken and Coleman virtually tied or within the margin of error, as well as several polls showing each candidate with a significant lead at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> The presence of a serious third party candidate further complicated matters.|$|E
25|$|Forty-two {{different}} sports, spanning 55 different disciplines, {{have been}} part of the Olympic program at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> Twenty-eight sports have comprised the schedule for three of the recent games, 2000, 2004, and 2008 Summer Olympics. Due to the removal of baseball and softball, there was a total of twenty-six sports in the 2012 Games.|$|E

5000|$|Always using right hand, when shaking hands, {{offering}} a gift, handing or receiving something, eating, <b>pointing</b> <b>or</b> generally touching <b>another</b> person.|$|R
50|$|If all 10 {{cards in}} a player's hand fit into melds {{and thereby the}} player has no deadwood, {{he or she can}} choose to go Gin in which case the round ends and the player going Gin {{receives}} a Gin bonus of 25 <b>points</b> (<b>or</b> <b>another</b> established amount) plus any deadwood points in the opponent's hand. The defending opponent can only lay out his or her melds and cannot lay off any deadwood into the melds of an opponent that has declared Gin. A player can go Gin with a hand of three or fewer melds as long as all cards fit into a meld. Players can also have an 11 card gin, see Big Gin Variant below.|$|R

Altogether, the group has had more than 30 different members at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> over the past 45 years. However, since 1993 there have only been two membership changes due to retirements.|$|E
25|$|During {{their time}} {{together}} Erica and Dimitri have lived in two castles at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another.</b> The first being Wildwind, his Pine Valley estate complete with a turret, which {{is used as a}} romantic symbol for another fairytale couple, Dimitri's cousin Princess Gillian Andrassy and her husband, Ryan Lavery. The second being Vadzel, the castle in Budapest, Hungary where they traveled early on in their relationship and shared their famous waltz in full Count Andrassy garb.|$|E
5000|$|Stark {{grew up in}} Rhineland-Palatinate. His father owned a {{vineyard}} in Gau-Odernheim in the Rheinhessen wine region. Stark, {{the second}} son, considered continuing in the family business. He studied economics at the University of Hohenheim and Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen, both near Stuttgart, from 1968 to 1973. During that time, he told an interviewer he participated in protests including against the Vietnam War: “We all, more or less at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> time <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> had revolutionary ideas about what was just. But this was an episode that {{came to an end}} with the end of my studies. Then I became more serious.” ...|$|R

25|$|In the {{canonical}} approach, theological concerns take precedent over historical interests. No attempt {{is made to}} reconstruct a historical portrait of Paul {{in order to prove}} some <b>point</b> <b>or</b> to disprove <b>another.</b> There is no psychologizing based on what Paul could or could not have said.|$|R
25|$|From –, {{only six}} teams (the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks, Montreal Canadiens, Detroit Red Wings, New York Rangers, and Toronto Maple Leafs) {{played in the}} NHL. With so few opponents, teams played more {{frequently}} and games were often underscored by personal rivalries between players. These personal and team rivalries lasted for many years, as the turnover rate on NHL rosters was very low. At one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> during this era, all the teams had animosity towards one another.|$|E
25|$|The {{changes were}} {{accompanied}} by violent turmoil which included the trial and execution of the king, vast bloodshed and repression during the Reign of Terror, and warfare involving every other major European power. Subsequent events that {{can be traced to}} the Revolution include the Napoleonic Wars, two separate restorations of the monarchy, and two additional revolutions as modern France took shape. In the following century, France would be governed at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> as a republic, constitutional monarchy, and two different empires.|$|E
25|$|Initially Camilleri {{used the}} group to play gigs in local cafes after the {{dissolution}} of his previous band, Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons. From 1983 to 1988 he used the name Joey Vincent for his work with the band. Membership in the band has been loose and fluid. Most of The Falcons, at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another,</b> have been members; numerous other Australian musicians have drifted {{in and out of}} the line-ups. Aside from zydeco, their early style included cajun music.|$|E
5000|$|The Swivel fold is {{difficult}} to describe as the term is loosely defined {{and there are so}} many different versions that could be called [...] "swivel folds". However, generally swivel folds involve a flap of paper [...] "swivelling" [...] at a certain <b>point</b> <b>or</b> vertex and <b>another</b> flap <b>or</b> edge of paper, connected to the first, dragged around that <b>point</b> <b>or</b> vertex.|$|R
5000|$|Total {{internal}} reflection {{is used as}} a means of focusing waves that cannot effectively be reflected by common means. X-ray telescopes are constructed by creating a converging [...] "tunnel" [...] for the waves. As the waves interact at low angle with the surface of this tunnel they are reflected toward the focus <b>point</b> (<b>or</b> toward <b>another</b> interaction with the tunnel surface, eventually being directed to the detector at the focus). A conventional reflector would be useless as the X-rays would simply pass through the intended reflector.|$|R
40|$|A {{defective}} {{host response}} {{may be responsible}} for recurring infections in certain children. Recognition of these defects may be important both therapeutically for the patient and for genetic counseling for the family. Family history, age of onset of illness and type of infecting agents may all <b>point</b> to one <b>or</b> <b>another</b> defect in host resistance...|$|R
25|$|Canadian syllabics are {{currently}} {{used to write}} all of the Cree languages from Naskapi (spoken in Quebec) to the Rocky Mountains, including Eastern Cree, Woods Cree, Swampy Cree and Plains Cree. They are also used to write Inuktitut in the eastern Canadian Arctic; there they are co-official with the Latin script in the territory of Nunavut. They are used regionally for the other large Canadian Algonquian language, Ojibwe in Western Canada, {{as well as for}} Blackfoot, where they are obsolete. Among the Athabaskan languages further to the west, syllabics have been used at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> to write Dakelh (Carrier), Chipewyan, Slavey, Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib) and Dane-zaa (Beaver). Syllabics have occasionally been used in the United States by communities that straddle the border, but are principally a Canadian phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other regions}} of the American colonies, the region that is now Montgomery County saw protests against British {{taxation}} in the years before the American Revolution. In 1774, local residents met at Hungerford's Tavern and agreed to break off commerce with Great Britain. Following the signing of the Declaration of Independence, representatives of the area helped to draft the new state constitution and began to build a Maryland free of proprietary control. On September 6, 1776, the Maryland Constitutional Convention formed Montgomery County from lands that had at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> been part of Charles, Prince George's and Frederick Counties, naming it after General Richard Montgomery. The leaders of the new county chose as their county seat an area adjacent to Hungerford's Tavern {{near the center of the}} county, which later became Rockville. The newly formed Montgomery County supplied arms, food and forage for the Continental Army during the Revolution, in addition to soldiers.|$|E
25|$|On 5 October, not yet forty, Henry died at Bodfeld, the {{imperial}} hunting lodge in the Harz Mountains. His heart went to Goslar, {{his body to}} Speyer, to lie next to his father's in the family vault in the cathedral of Speyer. He {{had been one of}} the most powerful of the Holy Roman Emperors: his authority as king in Burgundy, Germany, and Italy was only rarely questioned, his power over the church was at the root of what the reformers he sponsored later fought against in his son, and his achievement in binding to the empire her tributaries was clear. Nevertheless, his reign is often pronounced a failure in that he apparently left problems far beyond the capacities of his successors to handle. The Investiture Controversy was largely the result of his church politics, though his popemaking gave the Roman diocese to the reform party. He united all the great duchies save Saxony to himself at one <b>point</b> <b>or</b> <b>another</b> but gave them all away. His most enduring and concrete monument may be the impressive palace (kaiserpfalz) at Goslar.|$|E
50|$|Both the Muslim and Hindu faiths {{somewhat}} abhor {{the use of}} {{the left}} hand. It is considered 'unclean'; the left hand is traditionally perceived as the hand used to clean yourself in the toilet. So when shaking hands, offering a gift, handing or receiving something, eating, <b>pointing</b> <b>or</b> generally touching <b>another</b> person, it is considered proper etiquette to always use your right hand.|$|R
50|$|The {{cross-connect}} box, {{also known}} as a serving area interface, is then installed to allow connections to be made more easily from the wire center to the destination point and ties up fewer facilities by not having dedication facilities from the wire center to every destination point. The plant is then taken directly to its destination <b>point</b> <b>or</b> to <b>another</b> small closure called a terminal, where access can also be gained to the plant if necessary. These access points are preferred as they allow faster repair times for customers and save telephone operating companies large amounts of money.|$|R
50|$|NOTAMs {{issued by}} a flight service station to {{highlight}} <b>or</b> <b>point</b> out <b>another</b> NOTAM, {{such as an}} FDC or NOTAM (D) NOTAM.
