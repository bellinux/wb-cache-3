5|$|Sultan Hamud was {{loyal to}} the British and acted as a figurehead for an {{essentially}} British-run government, the sultanate only being retained to avoid the costs involved with running Zanzibar directly as a crown colony. Several months after the war, Hamud, with British prompting, abolished slavery in all its forms. The emancipation of slaves required them to <b>present</b> <b>themselves</b> to a government office and proved a slow process—within ten years only 17,293 slaves had been freed, from an estimated population of 60,000 in 1891.|$|E
5|$|The authors {{discuss the}} broader concept of denial using social science theory, noting its {{occurrence}} appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions. They write that these motivations, when expanded {{from an individual}} to wider society, <b>present</b> <b>themselves</b> {{as a form of}} disease. The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet. The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater public about the same issue.|$|E

5|$|Damage and {{subsequent}} dysfunction in mitochondria {{is an important}} factor in a range of human diseases due to their influence in cell metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders often <b>present</b> <b>themselves</b> as neurological disorders, including autism. They can also manifest as myopathy, diabetes, multiple endocrinopathy, and a variety of other systemic disorders. Diseases caused by mutation in the mtDNA include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, MELAS syndrome and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. In the vast majority of cases, these diseases are transmitted by a female to her children, as the zygote derives its mitochondria and hence its mtDNA from the ovum. Diseases such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia are thought to be due to large-scale mtDNA rearrangements, whereas other diseases such as MELAS syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and others are due to point mutations in mtDNA.|$|E
5|$|In early 1644, just as Dorgon and his advisors were pondering how {{to attack}} the Ming, peasant rebellions were dangerously {{approaching}} Beijing. On 24 April of that year, rebel leader Li Zicheng breached {{the walls of the}} Ming capital, pushing the Chongzhen Emperor to hang himself on a hill behind the Forbidden City. Hearing the news, Dorgon's Chinese advisors Hong Chengchou and Fan Wencheng (范文程; 1597–1666) urged the Manchu prince to seize this opportunity to <b>present</b> <b>themselves</b> as avengers of the fallen Ming and to claim the Mandate of Heaven for the Qing. The last obstacle between Dorgon and Beijing was Ming general Wu Sangui, who was garrisoned at Shanhai Pass at the eastern end of the Great Wall. Himself caught between the Manchus and Li Zicheng's forces, Wu requested Dorgon's help in ousting the bandits and restoring the Ming. When Dorgon asked Wu to work for the Qing instead, Wu {{had little choice but to}} accept. Aided by Wu Sangui's elite soldiers, who fought the rebel army for hours before Dorgon finally chose to intervene with his cavalry, the Qing won a decisive victory against Li Zicheng at the Battle of Shanhai Pass on 27 May. Li's defeated troops looted Beijing for several days until Li left the capital on 4 June with all the wealth he could carry.|$|E
5|$|It is well {{understood}} that, {{at the moment}} {{it is only a}} minimum, the Society is always free to put in place the number of trains necessary to transport passengers who <b>present</b> <b>themselves,</b> that if it will satisfy this requirement, its proper interest is guaranteed, and, in giving greater public satisfaction, its infrastructure will be wisely used, instead of it travelling empty for part of the day to the detriment of its business. Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays, except Thursdays (racing), we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those going from the racecourse to the forest, but, concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse, it is imperative that the Chief Engineer (Lechelas) keeps the minimum to 30, otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of the line, because for this small distance, it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures.|$|E

5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also <b>present</b> <b>themselves</b> with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E
5|$|Ragnall is {{the only}} member of the meic Somairle known to have styled himself in {{documents}} rex insularum. His use of both the title and seal are probably derived from those of the leading members of the Crovan dynasty, such as his namesake Rǫgnvaldr, who not only bore the same title but was said to have borne a similar two-sided seal. The descriptions of the cousins' seals shows that these devices combined the imagery of a Norse-Gaelic galley and an Anglo-French knight. The maritime imagery probably symbolised the power of a ruler of an island-kingdom, and the equestrian imagery appears to have symbolised feudal society, in which the cult of knighthood had reached its peak in the twelfth- and early thirteenth centuries. The use of such seals by leading Norse-Gaelic lords, seated on the periphery of the kingdoms of Scotland and England, probably illustrates their desire to <b>present</b> <b>themselves</b> as up-to-date and modern to their contemporaries in Anglo-French society.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{suggest that}} people attempt to {{establish}} and maintain a desired personal image in social situations. People are motivated to <b>present</b> <b>themselves</b> towards others in a good light, and some researchers suggest that the optimistic bias is a representative of self-presentational processes: people want to appear more well-off than others. However, this is not through conscious effort. In a study where participants believed their driving skills would be either tested in either real-life or driving simulations, people who believed they were to be tested had less optimistic bias and were more modest about their skills than individuals who would not be tested. Studies also suggest that individuals who <b>present</b> <b>themselves</b> in a pessimistic and more negative light are generally less accepted by the rest of society. This might contribute to overly optimistic attitudes.|$|E
