40|$|In the {{fast-changing}} fashion market, being {{flexible and}} adaptive {{is a key}} to survival. Therefore, supply chain strategy like quick response is important in the fashion or textile industry. Selection of suppliers to support such strategies is thus {{one of the most critical}} activities, but is not well studied. Traditionally, suppliers are selected usually based on quantity requirement and cost, which are not the only important issues in the operation of a textile supply chain nowadays. This study presents an example on solving the supplier selection problem in the apparel industry by using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), which takes the operational performance (for example, flexibility, cost, and delivery) into account for supporting supply chain strategies. The system was implemented with the aid of the commercial software <b>package</b> <b>Expert</b> Choice.

A set of games is interpreted as a graph, in which every vertex represents a team, and every edge represents a team quality comparison evaluated directly from the score difference of a game. A weighted quality comparison value between every two teams is computed from the graph, based on the transitivity relationship of comparison values in the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). All the quality comparison values are input into the software <b>package</b> <b>Expert</b> Choice as the pair-wise comparison values in term of team quality, then Expert Choice can give the rankings of the teams. The method is illustrated {{through the use of}} scores associated with the 2007 Big East Conference football season. This method accounts for the margin of victory (score difference) in the rankings, which is the main difference as compared to the computer methods in the BCS system.

The selection of the best energy option is a complex function of many various variables and thus represents a multi-criteria decision-making problem. This study involved building a decision-making model in order to optimize energy consumption in hot arid regions. The study examined the best possible choice of energy source under hot arid conditions based {{on a number of}} aspects (criteria) that were subject to weighting by experts.

40|$|The mass-customization trend as {{flexible}} production philosophy {{has been adopted}} by many industries {{as a reaction to}} the fast changing customer demand environment. In relation to that mixed-model production (MMP) is a possibility for increasing flexibility, especially in the assembly department. However, many apparel companies have failed in their transition from traditional manufacturing to new, flexible manufacturing, which makes {{it difficult for them to}} be selected as suppliers who are capable of MMP. In most of the studies that have been done before, the problem of supplier selection was based on productivity and cost as the main selection criteria. As an alternative solution this research presents a new group of criteria for supplier selection with respect to the goal of MMP. The methodology of com-bining the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) with the support of the commercial software <b>package</b> <b>Expert</b> Choice and cluster analysis (CA) is proposed in this study.

WASDA mainly focused on municipal and industrial applications to produce conceptual and process design for primary, secondary and advanced treatments. It consists of multiple modules such as equalization tank, coagulation, neutralization, conventional activated sludge, extended aeration, sequencing batch reactor, oxidation ditch, rotating biological contactor and membrane system. This paper presents the architecture of WASDA for Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR), which includes the structural and developmental cycles of the SBR module that is available within WASDA <b>package.</b> <b>Expert</b> knowledge in the information base was assembled from design textbooks, manuals and other design requirements stipulated by the Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE) and Department of Sewerage Services (DoSS) and converted into Artificial Intelligence (AI) rules. The study provides a user-friendly approach to access essential knowledge about SBR and the procedures to design SBR, including design requirements, facilities selection and analysis of selected process performance.

40|$|Supplier {{selection}} {{has increasingly}} {{been regarded as}} one of the most important strategies in the globalization era. While many companies require different resources from the supply market, airline companies require supplies of parts and repair and maintenance services. The suppliers of these products and services are regarded as critical for the industry. With the multidimensional nature of the problem, supplier selection involves both tangible and intangible selection criteria. This paper presents a case study on solving the supplier selection problem in the airline industry through a decision support system that employs the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The system was implemented with the aid of the commercial software <b>package</b> <b>Expert</b> Choice. The significance of the study is to provide a new platform for airline companies in selecting suppliers on the basis of the proposed decision support system, which was tested with a Hong Kong-based airline company during the course of development. In addition, the model highlights the areas of most concern to airline companies in supplier selection. Unlike many similar studies, sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to improve the robustness of the results, and to understand the importance of different criteria with respect to the selected decision.

40|$|Designing {{environmentally}} friendly products {{has become a}} tighter requirement in the marketplace because of both the increasing trend in awareness of consumers and the obligations from legislation requirements. Unfortunately, {{this is not a}} straight forward decision for designers to evaluate whether their design options are satisfactory in terms of balancing various factors (for examples, different forms of environmental assessment) or not. This is partly attributed {{to the fact that there}} is no universally accepted approach for conducting such analysis. In this connection, this research makes reference to a European Union (EU) directive as a reference model and makes use of Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP), which is a useful tool to help designers to make decision, for evaluating eco-design options. The AHP model is developed based on two case studies on consumer electronic products. Pairwise comparisons, one of the key steps in AHP, are conducted with the expertise gained from the case studies and the help from the software <b>package</b> <b>Expert</b> Choice. The paper also reveals how design options can be evaluated, or be screened out. The proposed method does not require the designers to conduct detailed analysis (life-cycle assessment for example) for every new product options and hence can save their time.

40|$|Prediction of {{soil thermal}} {{conductivity}} k is particularly difficult at high temperatures T (50 - 90 °C) and very low moisture content θ; the k value may increase with temperature {{by a factor}} of 3 - 5. This phenomenon is due to water vapor migration resulting in latent heat transfer, which is strongly dependent on soil water characteristics (SWC). In the past, the SWC influence on k prediction was never studied in great detail - mainly {{due to a lack of}} reliable SWC experimental data at low θ. Currently, hydraulic properties of soils can be evaluated from numerous predictive models correlated with experimental data. The paper objectives focus on: effects of SWC on k prediction; explanation of nonlinear variation of k at high T with θ ranging over the full degree of saturation; large k over- predictions at low θ and high T. Results obtained show very strong k dependence on the SWC function; therefore, accuracy of SWC estimates cannot be disregarded. The paper explains a nonlinear k behavior at high T as a combined effect of water vapor migration, SWC, and soil air relative humidity. To this end the paper provides also information about Soil Thermal and Transport Properties — Expert System (STTP-ES), collection of the notable predictive models for these properties, for both moist and frozen soils, which have been gleaned from the literature and integrated into one software package.
