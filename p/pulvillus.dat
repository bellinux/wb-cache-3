50|$|The Horatii of the Republic {{bore the}} {{surnames}} Barbatus, Cocles, and <b>Pulvillus.</b> Of these, Barbatus and <b>Pulvillus</b> were family names, while Cocles {{appears to have}} been a personal cognomen, given to the hero of the Sublician bridge. Plutarchus supposes that it was derived from the Greek cyclops, because he had lost an eye, or because the shape of his face made it appear as if he had but one eye. Cocles is said to have been the nephew of Marcus Horatius <b>Pulvillus,</b> and if he left any issue, they do not seem to have carried on his surname. Other surnames appearing amongst the Horatii in later times may have been adopted by freedmen of the gens; the poet Quintus Horatius Flaccus was the son of a libertinus, and the cognomen Flaccus is not otherwise found amongst the Horatii.|$|E

50|$|He later {{entered the}} college of the augurs.

50|$|The gens Horatia was {{an ancient}} patrician family at Rome. In legend, the gens {{dates back to}} the time of Tullus Hostilius, the third King of Rome. One of its members, Marcus Horatius <b>Pulvillus,</b> was consul suffectus in 509 BC, {{the first year of the}} Republic, and again in 507. But the most famous of the Horatii was {{certainly}} his nephew, Publius Horatius Cocles, who held the Sublician bridge against the army of Lars Porsena circa 508 BC.|$|E
50|$|Brutus, who as the king's nephew {{was even}} closer to the royal house, was spared the same indignity, {{as a part of}} the Junia gens; but he fell in battle the same year against the king's forces. Publius Valerius Poplicola was {{appointed}} consul suffectus in the place of Collatinus, and the elderly Spurius Lucretius in place of Brutus; but he died soon after, and Marcus Horatius <b>Pulvillus</b> became consul in his place, the fifth and final consul of the first year of the Republic.|$|E
50|$|When the Fabii were ambushed at the Cremera, Menenius {{failed to}} intervene, {{although}} his forces were {{close enough to}} turn the tide without losing the strategic position. Not only were the Fabii destroyed and their position lost, but the Veientes continued toward Rome, where they defeated Menenius and occupied the Janiculum. Horatius <b>Pulvillus</b> was recalled in haste to defend the city. While Horatius won a first battle on the Janiculum against the Veientes, it was the consuls of the following year {{who were able to}} defeat the enemy and drive them out of Roman territory.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{hearing of}} the grave defeat, the Roman senate sent the consul Titus Menenius Lanatus with an army against the Veientes, but the Romans were {{defeated}} once again. The Veientes marched on Rome, and occupied the Janiculum. The Roman senate recalled the other consul Gaius Horatius <b>Pulvillus</b> from the Volsci, {{and there were two}} indecisive battles against the Veientes, the first near the temple of Spes near the Praenestine Gate, and the second at the Colline gate. Thereafter the Veientes withdrew from Rome and set about ravaging the countryside, until they were defeated by the Romans in the following year.|$|E

50|$|Three {{years after}} his consulship, in 457 BC, Roman {{territory}} was invaded by the Sabines, and an Aequian army took the towns of Corbio and Ortona. The Senate directed the consuls, Gaius Horatius <b>Pulvillus</b> and Quintus Minucius Esquilinus, to levy troops and take the field. However, the tribunes of the plebs, whose attempts to bring about various reforms had been continually frustrated and postponed {{in the face of}} one crisis or another, opposed the levy until their legislation could be taken up. The consul Horatius opposed the tribunes for staying the hand of the state at such an inopportune time, and seemed to sway public opinion; but the tribune Verginius asked that if the tribunes agreed to the levy, then the Senate should at least consider another measure to benefit the people of Rome.|$|E
5000|$|Under their pretarsi, {{members of}} the Diptera {{generally}} have paired lobes or pulvilli, meaning [...] "little cushions". There is a single <b>pulvillus</b> below each unguis. The pulvilli often have an arolium between them or otherwise a median bristle or empodium, meaning the meeting place of the pulvilli. On {{the underside of the}} tarsal segments there frequently are pulvillus-like organs or plantulae. The arolium, plantulae and pulvilli are adhesive organs enabling their possessors to climb smooth or steep surfaces. They all are outgrowths of the exoskeleton and their cavities contain blood. Their structures are covered with tubular tenent hairs, the apices of which are moistened by a glandular secretion. The organs are adapted to apply the hairs closely to a smooth surface so that adhesion occurs through surface molecular forces.|$|E
50|$|In 458BC, the Aequi to Rome's east broke their {{treaty of}} the year before and {{attempted}} to retake Tusculum (Frascati). The consuls for the year—L. Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus and G. Nautius Rutilus—led out two armies, one to Tusculum's relief and another to strike against the lands of the Aequi and their Sabine allies. Upon reaching Mount Algidus in the Alban Hills, the army under L. Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus encamped and rested instead of immediately attacking. The Aequi quickly deployed around their position and successfully besieged them, with only five horsemen escaping to tell the Roman Senate what had happened. With {{the army of the}} second consul unable to help, the senators fell into a panic and authorized the nomination of a dictator. G. Nautius Rutilus or Horatius <b>Pulvillus</b> named Cincinnatus for a term of six months.|$|E
5000|$|Perceiving the danger, three {{officers}} (of noble rank) stood shoulder-to-shoulder {{to allow}} their own troops to pass and block {{the passage of the}} enemy: Spurius Lartius and Titus Herminius Aquilinus, commanders of the right wing (equivalent to colonels or lieutenant generals), and Publius Horatius, a more junior officer of unspecified rank. He was a patrician, and the nephew of consul Marcus Horatius <b>Pulvillus</b> and had lost an eye in a previous battle (hence his agnomen [...] "Cocles"). He was also said to have been a descendant of one of the Horatii who had fought the Curiatii of Alba Longa. Livy defines his station in the defense as [...] "on guard at the bridge when he saw the Janiculum taken by a sudden assault and the enemy rushing down from it to the river ...." [...] The three defenders of the bridge withstood sword and missile attacks until the troops had all crossed.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the death}} of Brutus, Valerius was the sole {{surviving}} consul. Spurius Lucretius was chosen in place of Brutus, but he died after a few days, and was followed by Marcus Horatius <b>Pulvillus.</b> When Valerius began {{construction of a new}} house on top of the Velian Hill, which would be conspicuously visible from the Senate house, a rumor began to circulate that he intended to re-establish the monarchy, with himself as king. At once, Valerius stopped building, and demolished the structure in a single night. Addressing an assembly of the people, he caused his lictors to lower their fasces as a mark of respect, and to remove the axes from them within the city. [...] "I have just liberated Rome, bravely, but now I am slandered, like being either an Aquillius or a Vitellian. I am the bitterest enemy of the former kings, so I shouldn't be accused of wanting to be king." [...] In order to allay suspicions, he caused his house to be built {{at the foot of the}} hill, rather than its peak. In later times, the Temple of Victory stood in the same place.|$|E
50|$|Camillus and Valerius met the Antiates at Satricum. In {{addition}} to Volsci, the Antiates {{had brought a}} large number of Latins and Hernici to the field. At first daunted by the size and composition of the enemy army, after a rousing speech by Camillus the Roman soldiers charged the enemy. It was claimed that to further incite his men, Camillus ordered the army standard flung into the enemy's lines. The Volsci were routed and slaughtered in great number during their flight until a rainstorm brought an end to the fighting. The Latins and Hernici now abandoned the Volsci who took refuge inside Satricum. Camillus first began a regular investment, but when sorties disrupted the construction of his siege works, he changed tactics and carried the city by storm. Leaving Valerius in command of the army, Camillus returned to Rome to urge the senate to continue the war and attack Antium, the Volscian capital. However upon news that the Etruscans were attacking the border strongholds of Nepete and Sutrium, it was instead decided that Camillus and Valerius should take on the Etruscans with a new army raised at Rome. Consular tribunes Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus and Lucius Horatius <b>Pulvillus</b> were sent to carry on the Volscian war Livy then describe how Camillus again defeated the Etruscans at Sutrium and Nepete.|$|E
50|$|Livy is {{our only}} {{source for the}} next few years. He reports that in 380 the Romans stormed Velitrae, but the main event of that year was the Roman Dictator Titus Quinctius Cincinnatus {{successful}} campaign against Praeneste who was forced to sue for peace. In 379 the Romans assigned command of the Volscian war to consular tribunes Publius and Gaius Manlius due to the two's high birth and popularity, but this proved to be a mistake. The Roman commanders sent out their foragers without first doing any scouting, and were then tricked into an ambush by an enemy spy who falsely reported that the foragers had been surrounded. The Volsci also attacked the Roman camp. In Rome it was first decided to nominate a Dictator, but when the Romans realized that the Volsci did not intend to follow up their victory, they chose to recall their army from Volscian territory instead. New colonists were also sent to reinforce Setia. The next year, 378, the Volsci invaded and plundered Roman territory in all directions. At Rome the tribunes of the plebs first obstructed the enrolment of troops until the patricians accepted their conditions that no war tax would be paid until the war was over and no debt suits be brought to court. With these internal difficulties out of the way, the Romans divided their forces into two armies. One, commanded by consular tribunes Spurius Furius Medullinus and Marcus Horatius <b>Pulvillus,</b> was to march towards Antium and the coastal areas, the other, under Quintus Servilius Fidenas and Lucius Geganius Macerinus, was to head for Ecetra and the mountains. Hoping to draw the Volsci into battle, the Romans set about ravaging the Volscian countryside. Having burned several outlying villages and destroyed the enemy's harvest, the two armies returned to Rome with their booty.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, {{historian}} Gary Forsythe {{dismissed the}} second decemvirate as unhistorical. He presents {{a number of}} arguments for his view. First, it is an invention modeled {{on the story of}} the Thirty Tyrants. Athens was forced to abolish her democracy following her defeat by Sparta and it was replaced by a commission tasked with drafting the laws of a new constitution. They arrested and executed political opponents and seized power. Many Athenians fled or were exiled. They formed a militia and reached Peiraeus (Piraeus, the port of Athens), defeated the forces sent by the Thirty Tyrants, and then forced them to abdicate and restored democracy. Forsythe sees similarities with the story of the decemviri, where the republican offices are suspended and replaced by the decemviri who were also tasked with drafting new laws, who then refused to leave office when their term was up, became tyrannical, were forced to resign by a secession and the republican offices were restored. Second, the story fits with the Greek theory that a good form of government gives way its corrupt counterpart, which, in turn, leads to back to another good one. The first decemvirate represents “ideal aristocratic rule in its ideal form, followed by the corrupt oligarchy of the second one whose misrule leads to rebellion and further political change.” Third, one year and one decemvirate should have been enough to draw up a legislation which was not overly complicated. Forsythe also says that the idea of the decemviri being overthrown “might have been suggested to later Roman historians by the names of the consuls for 449 BC, Lucius Valerius Potitus and Marcus Horatius Barbatus.” They were similar to the names of the consuls for 509 BC, the year of the establishment of the Roman republic (Publius Valerius Publicola and Marcus Horatius <b>Pulvillus).</b> The republic was instituted with the overthrow of the last king of Rome, who was a tyrant, in a rebellion and the decision {{to do away with the}} monarchy.|$|E
5000|$|Both hairy {{and smooth}} pads in {{arthropods}} act {{to maximize the}} amount of contact with a surface. The foot pads of flies are densely covered with flexible hair-like structures called setae, and some lizards and spiders use similar hairy pads to create adhesive effects. This indicates a favourable design for hairy pad adhesion. [...] Hairy pads can be classified as <b>pulvillus,</b> fossula spongiosa, and tenent hairs. Hairy attachment pads employed few other features, such as flaw tolerance, lower sensitivity to contamination and roughness. Hairy attachment systems are typical for evolutionary younger and successful insect groups, such as Coleoptera and Diptera. The density of hairs increases with increasing body weight. An increase of the attachment strength in hairy systems is realized by {{increasing the number of}} single contact points. [...] Protuberances on the hairy pads of Coleoptera, Dermaptera and Diptera belong to different types. Representatives of the first two lineages have socketed setae on their pads. [...] Setae can range in length from a few micrometers to several millimeters. [...] Dipteran outgrowths are acanthae which are single sclerotized protuberances originating from a single cell. The acanthae are hollow inside and some have pores under the terminal plate, which presumably deliver an adhesive secretion directly to the contact area. Hairy attachment pads of reduviid bugs, flies [...] and beetles [...] secrete fluid into the contact area. The secretion contains non-volatile, lipid-like substances, but in some species it is two-phasic emulsion presumably containing water-soluble and lipid-soluble fractions. [...] Adhesion strongly decreases as the volume of the secretion decreases, which indicates that a layer of pad secretion that covers the terminal plates is crucial for generating a strong attractive force. Data suggests that besides van der Waals and Coulomb forces flies rely on attractive capillary forces mediated by the pad secretion. At low humidity, adhesion strongly depends on the amount of liquid deposited on the surface, and therefore contact duration.|$|E
