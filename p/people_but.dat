5|$|Basically, {{a lot of}} {{you know}} the {{political}} situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate <b>people.</b> <b>But</b> I am not willing to give up.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the appeal}} of the books among an adult audience, Bloomsbury {{commissioned}} a second line of editions in an 'adult' style. These initially used black-and-white photographic art for the covers showing objects from the books (including a very American Hogwarts Express) without depicting <b>people,</b> <b>but</b> later shifted to partial colourisation with a picture of Slytherin's locket {{on the cover of the}} final book.|$|E
5|$|No {{damage or}} {{casualties}} {{resulted from the}} Nazko earthquakes, which were {{too small to be}} felt by <b>people,</b> <b>but</b> local seismographs recorded them. The earthquake swarm occurred at the eastern end of a known volcanic zone called the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This is an east-west trending line of volcanic formations extending from the Central Coast to the Central Interior of British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Shaun Udal and Shane Warne {{were the}} captains for the Panthers and the Royals respectively.

5|$|The An Lushan Rebellion {{began in}} December 755, {{and was not}} {{completely}} suppressed for almost eight years. It caused enormous disruption to Chinese society: the census of 754 recorded 52.9 million <b>people,</b> <b>but</b> ten years later, the census counted just 16.9 million, the remainder having been displaced or killed.|$|E
5|$|The global {{prevalence}} of FH is approximately 10 million people. In most populations studied, heterozygous FH occurs in about 1:500 <b>people,</b> <b>but</b> not all develop symptoms. Homozygous FH occurs in about 1:1,000,000.|$|E
5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving <b>people,</b> <b>but</b> if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much like that of a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E

5|$|Bauer {{concludes that}} Brand was a courageous {{man who had}} passionately wanted to help the Jewish <b>people,</b> <b>but</b> his life was plagued after the mission by suspicion, {{including}} from {{other members of the}} Aid and Rescue Committee, because of his failure to return to Budapest. After the British released him, he joined the Stern Gang, who were fighting to remove the British from Palestine. He and Hansi Brand lived {{for the rest of their}} lives in Israel, at first moving to the Givat Brenner kibbutz, then Tel Aviv, with their two sons.|$|E
5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South Africa as {{the totality of}} the white power structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only participated in the oppression of black <b>people</b> <b>but</b> were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E
5|$|Businesses {{that employ}} 50 or more <b>people</b> <b>but</b> {{do not offer}} health {{insurance}} to their full-time employees pay a tax penalty if the government has subsidized a full-time employee's healthcare through tax deductions or other means. This {{is commonly known as}} the employer mandate. This provision was included to encourage employers to continue providing insurance once the exchanges began operating. Approximately 44% of the population was covered directly or indirectly through an employer.|$|E

5|$|During his {{operations}} in Isauria, Illus took Zeno's brother, Longinus, prisoner and {{kept him in}} an Isaurian fortress. Because {{he thought he would}} have great influence over a restored Zeno, he changed sides and marched with Zeno towards Constantinople in the summer of 476. When Basiliscus received news of this danger, he hastened to recall his ecclesiastical edicts and to conciliate the Patriarch and the <b>people,</b> <b>but</b> it was too late.|$|E
5|$|Early grunge concerts were sparsely {{attended}} (many by {{fewer than}} a dozen <b>people)</b> <b>but</b> Sub Pop photographer Charles Peterson's pictures helped create the impression that such concerts were major events. Mudhoney, which was formed by former members of Green River, served as the flagship band of Sub Pop during their entire time with the label and spearheaded the Seattle grunge movement. Other record labels in the Pacific Northwest that helped promote grunge included C/Z Records, Estrus Records, EMpTy Records and PopLlama Records.|$|E
5|$|Expectations of the {{eventual}} {{population of the}} town were revised upwards several times. The 1949 master plan had allowed for 50,000 <b>people,</b> <b>but</b> this was amended to 55,000 in 1956 after the Development Corporation had successfully resisted pressure from the Minister for Town and Country Planning to accommodate 60,000. Nevertheless, plans dated 1961 anticipated growth to 70,000 by 1980, and by 1969 consideration was given to an eventual expansion of up to 120,000.|$|E

5000|$|Here, Longford explains, 'Blunt stood Rudyard Kipling's {{familiar}} concept on its head, {{arguing that}} the imperialists' burden is not their moral responsibility for the colonised <b>peoples,</b> <b>but</b> their urge to make money out of them.' ...|$|R
50|$|Moscoso and {{his army}} marched west, {{possibly}} reaching northwest Louisiana and Texas. They encountered indigenous <b>peoples,</b> <b>but</b> lacked interpreters {{to communicate with}} them. This circumstance and poor weather forced the group back to the Mississippi River.|$|R
5|$|I believe {{also two}} things. As I just said, {{there must be}} no imposition. Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – I {{do not know how}} long – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language which can be used not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing <b>people,</b> <b>but</b> to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E
5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to <b>people.</b> <b>But</b> I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, E was {{spoken by}} about 30,000 <b>people,</b> <b>but</b> by 2008 this number had dwindled to 9,000. Most E {{speakers}} {{are classified as}} Zhuang by the Chinese government. E speakers live primarily in the Guangxi autonomous region of China, specifically in the Rongshui Miao county and border areas of Luocheng Mulao. Villages inhabited by E speakers include Xiatan, Simo, Xinglong, and the Yonglei district. Ethnologue classifies E as rank 6b (Threatened). E speakers' most commonly spoken other languages are Yue Chinese and the Guiliu variant of Southwestern Mandarin.|$|E
