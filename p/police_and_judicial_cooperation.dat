40|$|<b>Policing</b> <b>and</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> across {{international}} borders {{is now an}} expectation, {{and within}} the EU, is often mandated, but the desirability of criminal justice cooperation between EU Member States and the UK is now debated. This paper examines recent UK political interventions {{in the field of}} EU criminal law. This has focused upon the so-called ‘block opt-out’ decision whereupon the UK government have to choose whether to ‘opt-out’ en masse of all unamended <b>policing</b> <b>and</b> criminal law instruments entered into prior to the 2009 Lisbon Treaty (under Article 10 (1) of Protocol 36). The paper will look in particular at two EU instruments central to the ongoing and future development of EU <b>policing</b> <b>and</b> <b>judicial</b> cooperation: the European Arrest Warrant, and the exchange of forensic DNA profiles, fingerprints and vehicle registration details under the Prüm Treaty. While the UK government are asserting (at this point) that they are to opt back ‘in’ to the European Arrest Warrant, they are refraining from opting back in (so remaining ‘out’) of the Prüm Treaty. Examining the rationales {{for the use of the}} opt-out, and the decisions in respect of each of these instruments, the paper will ask whether the choice to ‘opt out’ can be reconciled with the aspiration of securing an EU Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, and whether it is appropriate that the UK should be doing the ‘hokey cokey’ with EU <b>policing</b> <b>and</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Policing</b> <b>and</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> across {{international}} borders {{is now an}} expectation, with {{strategies to}} combat terrorism, organized and serious crime, as well as domestic crime problems, increasingly incorporate the exchange of forensic information and intelligence between nations. While networks of policing cooperation are not novel, their powers and capabilities have been growing {{in recent years and}} bilateral and multi-lateral agreements to exchange data between countries continue apace. With increasing demand for, and mechanisms enabling the extra-territorial exchange of evidence under mutual legal assistance, as well as direct law enforcement exchange of data there are increasing numbers of criminal investigations where evidence may have been collected, examined, or interpreted in a different country. Since the Prum Treaty of 2005, the exchange of DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data (fingerprints) and vehicle registration data has become both automated, and mandatory across the EU. This exchange of evidence, highlights some of the wider issues raised by the exchange of scientific evidence for use in criminal proceedings undertaken in a different jurisdiction from that where the evidence emanated. Such exchange mechanisms raise not just technical issues, but questions of principle that need consideration as the international exchange of forensic information and intelligence is set to increase exponentially...|$|R

50|$|On 26 May 2010 the European Commission {{presented}} the draft negotiating mandate for {{an agreement between}} the European Union and the United States of America on the protection of personal data when transferred and processed {{for the purpose of}} preventing, investigating, detecting or prosecuting criminal offences, including terrorism, in the framework of <b>police</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in criminal matters (hereafter: the EU-US general agreement).

40|$|The {{drive for}} {{harmonisation}} of environmental criminal standards {{at both the}} international and European level emerges from the increasing recognition of the scale and seriousness of environmental crime, the need to strengthen mechanisms of <b>police</b> <b>and</b> <b>judicial</b> interstate <b>cooperation</b> to combat cross-border crime, and the objective to ensure fair competition {{in a global economy}} and an integrated EU common market. The harmonisation of environmental criminal law requires a competent institutional framework able to convey the need for criminalisation of environmental harm while not overriding national aspirations to sovereignty in criminal matters. The book Environmental Criminal Liability and Enforcement in European and International Law assesses legal, theoretical and practical questions of harmonisation of national environmental criminal law and the mechanisms for cooperation by sovereign states under European and International Law, with a particular emphasis on legislative developments in the European Union, the Council of Europe and other international institutions, assessing the case for an extension of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court over international environmental crimes...|$|R

Among other steps, the EU has established a common definition of terrorism and a common list of terrorist groups, an EU arrest warrant, enhanced tools to stem terrorist financing, and new measures to strengthen external EU border controls and improve aviation security...|$|R
40|$|Because mutual {{recognition}} is now {{enshrined in the}} Lisbon Treaty as a basic principle for <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> in criminal matters, a consistent interpretation and application becomes all the more important. Nevertheless, no legally binding definition of {{mutual recognition}} is provided and a quick scan of the relevant instruments cannot but lead {{to the conclusion that}} mutual recognition appears in as many shapes and sizes as there are instruments referring to it. There seems to be no common understanding of what mutual recognition is, can and cannot be and how consistency is to be guaranteed. Therefore this article critically reviews mutual recognition as a principle and assesses the inconsistencies in the application thereof. The analysis is based on two hypotheses that could clarify the divergent evolution of the principle. The first hypothesis to explain the divergent evolutions is linked to the action radius and the proposition that mutual recognition is the cornerstone of <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> only. The second hypothesis suggests that the reason for these divergent evolutions is the lack of a common understanding of what mutual recognition entails, what it means or should mean in practice. Based on a thorough analysis of the relevant policy documents, treaties <b>and</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> instruments (including their preparatory documentation and transcripts from debates in various fora) it is recommended to no longer distinguish between <b>police,</b> customs <b>and</b> <b>judicial</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> move ahead with the introduction of mutual recognition as a basic principle for international cooperation in criminal matters in its entirety. Furthermore, the suggestion is made to introduce a lex mitior principle as a new automatic correcting mechanism to temper the effect of mutual recognition {{from the perspective of the}} persons involved...|$|R
