In {{the present}} work, we report the {{preparation}} of PLZT thin films in pure perovskite phase by RF magnetron sputtering without external substrate heating and their integration with micro-cantilevers. The ‘lift-off ’ process for pat-terning different layers of a micro-cantilever including PLZT, Pt/Ti and Au/Cr was employed. The basic requirement of lift-off process is that the deposition temper-ature should not exceed 200 ◦C otherwise photoresist will burn out. Therefore, one of {{the aims of the}} present work was to prepare PLZT film at lower deposition temperatures, which can be subsequently annealed to form pure perovskite phase. This also strongly favours the incorporation of ‘lift-off ’ process for patterning in the complete process flow. As no external substrate heating was required in the deposition of PLZT film, this objective has been successfully accomplished in the present work. The ‘lift-off ’ process has been successfully adopted for patterning the composite layers of PLZT/Pt/Ti and Au/Cr using thick <b>positive</b> <b>photo-resist</b> (STR- 1045). Different types of cantilever beams incorporating PLZT films have been successfully fabricated using ‘lift-off ’ process and bulk micromachining tech-nology. The proposed process can be advantageously applied for the fabrication of various MEMS devices...|$|E
