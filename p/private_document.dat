25|$|Not {{much can}} be {{determined}} about Pacificus from contemporary documents, as few survive from his time. His existence is proved {{by at least one}} <b>private</b> <b>document</b> bearing his autograph signature from 809, as well as possibly a second similar document from 814. These documents relate to the properties held by the schola sacerdotum (a school for priests) he is credited with founding in Verona. There are several other charters or documents claimed to have been written or signed by Pacificus, but their authenticity is currently a matter of debate. In addition there are several marginalia believed to have been written by Pacificus on manuscripts from Church's Veronese archives, as well as numerous manuscripts attributed to him.|$|E
25|$|Apparently part of {{the royal}} agenda for the Council of Husillos of 1088 was the {{enhancing}} of royal control over Coimbra and its environs. The sole preserved document of the council was confirmed by a Martim, bishop-elect of Coimbra. Later {{in the same year}} a <b>private</b> <b>document</b> of Coimbra cited him, although still just as bishop-elect. Pierre David identified him as prior of the cathedral chapter of Coimbra and as the protégé of Sisnando Davides, who opposed the substitution of the Mozarabic rite (also known as Visigothic or Hispanic rite) for the Roman rite. But if Sisnando had proposed him and Alfonso had accepted him {{it is difficult to see}} why he was never consecrated. This obscure dispute continued for in the following year (1089) one Julian appears as bishop and in 1091 a John. They are probably the same person. In the 1091 document the bishop was given permission to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.|$|E

He persuaded Northrup to pose as an old friend writing in support of his appeals; in one letter, she claimed untruthfully to have [...] "known Lafayette Ronald Hubbard for many years" [...] and described his supposed pre-war state of health. His health and emotional difficulties were reflected in another, much more <b>private,</b> <b>document</b> which has been dubbed [...] "The Affirmations". It is thought to have been written around 1946–7 as part of an attempted program of self-hypnotism. His sexual difficulties with Northrup, for which he was taking testosterone supplements, are a significant feature of the document. He wrote: ...|$|E

2500|$|Suero {{was one of}} {{the leading}} magnates of Asturias. He ruled Babia from at least 14 April 1117 and Tineo from at least 26 May 1120. He was still ruling these places as late as 21 May 1136, when he is cited in the same {{document}} as also governing the western half of Asturias centred on Oviedo. He was described as count [...] "in Asturias" [...] and Vadabia (Babia) in another <b>private</b> <b>document</b> of the same year. Bernard Reilly has suggested that it was around 1120 that Urraca began extending Suero's authority north out of the province of León and the Bierzo and into western Asturias.|$|E
2500|$|Ponce, {{following}} his fall from favour, {{went to the}} court of Alfonso VIII of Castile, son of Sancho III, which had moved to the fortress of Abia possibly to receive the defecting count. The court was at Sahagún on 29 August when Ponce first makes an appearance there in the surviving records. In April 1169 he played {{a leading role in the}} siege of the town of Zorita de los Canes, which was being held by the relatives and supporters of Fernando Rodríguez de Castro against Alfonso VIII. He joined with Nuño Pérez de Lara in the initial attack, which was a failure. Later, Ponce and Nuño went to negotiate with the castellan, Lope de Arenas, but were betrayed and arrested. There is a <b>private</b> <b>document</b> from 25 April by which these events are dated, for it was redacted [...] "at the time when Count Nuño and Count Ponce were defeated at Zorita". Alfonso VIII continued to besiege the town in which his two generals were being held until at least 14 May, when a royal charter of donation was drawn up [...] "about (i.e., around) Zorita, at that time when Count Nuño and Count Ponce were being held captive there by the most evil Lope de Arenas". The donation was made to the military Order of Calatrava founded by his father. By 19 May, Zorita had surrendered and the two captives been freed. A royal charter issued that day [...] "was made in Zorita, at the time when Count Nuño and Count Ponce were liberated from captivity there". These last two charters indicate the part likely played by the knights of Calatrava in the capture of Zorita and the liberation of Ponce de Minerva, and it is probably therefore in gratefulness that Ponce soon after gaining his freedom made over to the Order some mills he owned in Toledo.|$|E

60|$|Lord Byron wrote a poem in September 1816, in Switzerland, {{just after}} the separation, in which he stated, in so many words, these accusations against his wife. Shortly after the poet's death Murray {{published}} this poem, together with the 'Fare thee well,' and the lines to his sister, under the title of 'Domestic Pieces,' in his standard edition of Byron's poetry. It is to be remarked, then, that this was for some time a <b>private</b> <b>document,</b> shown to confidential friends, and made use of judiciously, as readers or listeners to his story were able to bear it. Lady Byron then had a strong party in England. Sir Samuel Romilly and Dr. Lushington were her counsel. Lady Byron's parents were living, and the appearance in the public prints of such a piece as this would have brought down an aggravated storm of public indignation.|$|E

My letter assumes that the document will be easily found among the admiral's papers; and it mentions that I am the solicitor appointed by Mrs. Noel Vanstone to receive communications on her behalf. My object in taking this step is to cause a search to be instituted for the Trust--in the very probable event of the executors not having met with it yet-before the usual measures are adopted for the administration of the admiral's estate. We will threaten legal proceedings, if we find that the object does not succeed. But I anticipate no such necessity. Admiral Bartram's executors must be men of high standing and position; and they will do justice to you and to themselves in this matter by looking for the Trust.|$|E
