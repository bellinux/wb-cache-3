5|$|For one contract, in July 2000, Enron and Blockbuster Video {{signed a}} 20-year {{agreement}} to introduce on-demand entertainment to various U.S. cities by year-end. After several pilot projects, Enron recognized estimated <b>profits</b> <b>of</b> more than $110 {{million from the}} deal, even though analysts questioned the technical viability and market demand of the service. When the network failed to work, Blockbuster withdrew from the contract. Enron continued to recognize future profits, even though the deal resulted in a loss.|$|E
5|$|Gaiman {{described}} {{writing the}} series as odd, {{since he had}} not written comics in half a decade; the story was trimmed down significantly as the size went from six 36-page chapters to eight 22-page segments.

The <b>profits</b> <b>of</b> the series went to help fund his Marvels and Miracles LLC company, which is fighting for the rights to Marvelman.|$|E

5|$|Altan Khan {{eventually}} {{made peace with}} China when it opened border cities for trade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid. This, coupled with Qi and Tan's efforts to secure the frontier, brought a period of relative peace along the border. However, minor raids still happened {{from time to time}} when the <b>profits</b> <b>of</b> plunder outweighed those of trade, prompting the Ming to close all gaps along the frontier around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only a small}} affray, it {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} some important people; viz. the Duke of Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland, and Lord Clifford. It has been suggested that, whilst Somerset might have been targeted by York, the latter too might have been intentionally slain by the Neville brothers. It was John who, after the battle, appears to have been responsible for the victorious Duke of York removing Sir William Skipwith from the household offices the latter held of the Duke. Neville was said to have achieved this by pointing out how Skipwith failed to join York in battle; John Neville subsequently shared in the <b>profits</b> <b>of</b> York's redistribution of Skipwith's ex-offices.|$|E

5|$|In 1348 {{a plague}} {{known as the}} Black Death crossed from {{mainland}} Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population. After an initial period of economic shock, England began {{to adapt to the}} changed economic situation. The death rate among the peasantry meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and manpower in much shorter supply. Labourers could charge more for their work and, in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards. In turn, the <b>profits</b> <b>of</b> landowners were eroded. The trading, commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated.|$|E

5|$|The tulip was {{different}} from every other flower known to Europe at that time, with a saturated intense petal color that no other plant had.

5|$|While Burger King's {{advertising}} {{programs were}} highly focused on its new product, {{most of the}} company's sales gains {{were the result of}} aggressive price cutting by Burger King, specifically pricing its signature Whopper sandwich at 99¢, according to analysts at Salomon Brothers. The price cutting promotions by Burger King, and number-three chain Wendy's, forced McDonald's into its own price cutting program. According to Salomon, the burger segment's price wars would have a detrimental effect on the <b>profits</b> <b>of</b> segment leaders, allowing other smaller chains such as Sonic Drive-In, Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr to position themselves as attractive alternatives to the big three chains.|$|E

5|$|A {{disappointed}} Uslan then wrote {{a script}} titled Return of the Batman {{to give the}} film industry {{a better idea of}} his vision for the film. Uslan later compared its dark tone to that of , which his script pre-dated by six years. In November 1979, producer Jon Peters and Casablanca FilmWorks, headed by Peter Guber, joined the project. The four producers felt it was best to pattern the film's development after that of Superman (1978). Uslan, Melniker and Guber pitched Batman to Universal Pictures, but the studio turned it down. The project was publicly announced with a budget of $15 million in July 1980 at the Comic Art Convention in New York. Casablanca FilmWorks was absorbed into PolyGram Pictures in 1980. Guber and Peters left PolyGram Pictures in 1982 and took the Batman film rights with them, although PolyGram would retain at least 7.5% of the <b>profits</b> <b>of</b> said rights due to a contractual agreement. Guber and Peters immediately set up shop at Warner Bros., which finally decided to accept Batman.|$|E
5|$|A {{prospectus}} {{was issued}} which contained a detailed {{breakdown of the}} likely costs, revenue and <b>profits</b> <b>of</b> such a scheme, and the promotors prepared to obtain an Act of Parliament. During this time, someone challenged the original survey and another local surveyor was asked to review it. John Beauchamp suggested that no locks would be required on the upper section, but that costs {{were likely to be}} £15,234. This was later raised to £18,000, and the Act of Parliament, which authorised the construction of a canal that followed Hammett's plans, was obtained on 28 May 1827. The proprietors were empowered to raise £18,000 by the issue of 360 shares of £50 each, with powers to raise another £5,000 by mortgage, or to borrow any part of the £18,000 from the Exchequer Bills Commissioners.|$|E
5|$|Although Texas {{eventually}} adopted {{much of the}} Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal {{practices were}} retained. Among these was the Spanish model of keeping certain personal property safe from creditors. Texas implemented the first homestead exemption in the United States in 1839, and its property exemption laws are now the most liberal state in the United States. Furthermore, Spanish law maintained that both husband and wife should share equally in the <b>profits</b> <b>of</b> marriage, and, like many other former Spanish provinces, Texas retained the idea of community property rather than use the Anglo laws in which all property belonged to the husband. Furthermore, Spanish law allowed an independent executor to be named in probate cases who {{is not required to}} gain court permission for each act not explicitly listed in the testament. Texas retained this idea, and it has eventually spread to other states, included Arizona, Washington, and Idaho. In other legal matters, Texas kept the Spanish principle of adoption, becoming the first U.S. state to allow adoption.|$|E
