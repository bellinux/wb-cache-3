5000|$|After {{the main}} {{friction}} zone, some car washes have a dedicated care zone. Prior to entering the care zone, {{the car is}} rinsed with fresh water. This is immediately followed {{by a series of}} extra services. In many car washes, the first of these services is a <b>polish</b> <b>wax.</b> <b>Polish</b> <b>waxes</b> fill in microscopic imperfections in the vehicle's clear coat, thus improving shine. After the <b>polish</b> <b>wax</b> application is typically a retractable mitter or top brush and, in some cases, side brushes or wrap-around brushes. Next is a protectant, which creates a thin protective film over a vehicle's surface. Protectants generally repel water, which assists in drying the car and aiding in the driver's ability to see through their windshield during rain. A low-end wax or clear coat protectant follows the main protectant. A drying agent is typically applied {{at the end of the}} tunnel to assist in removing water from the vehicle's surface prior to forced air drying. After the drying agent, there may be a [...] "spot free" [...] rinse of soft water, that has been filtered of the salts normally present, and sent through semi-permeable membranes to produce highly purified water that will not leave spots.|$|R

These operations require skilled worker and are generally difficult to automate due to the complex motion trajectories. The paper describes a robotic cell for finishing {{operations in}} a custom shoe production plant. Such customization of shoe production should allow production of small batches of shoes of the same type. This requires automatic set up and adaptation of the production line. To meet these requirements, a CAD system for automatic generation, optimization and validation of motion trajectories was integrated into a robotic cell. In automatic trajectory generation some of the major problems are limitations posed by the robot joint limits, robot singularities and environment obstacles. These problems were solved using the kinematic redundancy of the robot manipulator...|$|R

A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly on the boot, followed by further buffing with a clean dry cloth or brush, usually provides good results. Another technique, known as spit-polishing or bull polishing, involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or spit. This achieves the mirror-like, high-gloss finish sometimes known as a spit shine or bull which is especially valued in military organizations.

In this work, natural wax extraction was carried out on different types of sugarcane waste (rind, leaf and bagasse) using supercritical CO 2 (scCO(2)). Substantial quantities of long-chain aldehydes and n-policosanols (nutraceutical compounds) were found in the rind (83 % of total composition). Interestingly, the wax obtained from the leaf residues varied from other types of waxes from sugarcane waste, with low aldehyde and n-policosanol contents (normally found in high quantities) and considerable amounts of high-value triterpenoids (169 +/- 6 mg/g wax), which have well-known medicinal properties. The use of sugarcane leaf residues for the extraction of waxes has not been previously considered, though the amount of these residues increased significantly after the switch to green harvesting. Sugarcane bagasse wax showed the highest ester composition (37 +/- 1. 5 mg/g of wax), which can be useful in a host of applications, ranging from cosmetics to hard <b>wax</b> <b>polishes,</b> lubricants, coatings and plasticisers.
