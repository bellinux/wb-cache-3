5000|$|The Tasmanian {{ground parrot}} (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus</b> leachi) is not {{considered}} threatened at state level [...] and is most common in south west Tasmania.|$|R
50|$|Next to {{and partly}} {{surrounding}} the township is the 29 800 ha Nooramunga Marine and Coastal Park. This park {{has a number}} of threatened species including the little tern, the white-bellied sea eagle, Lewin's rail, ground parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus),</b> swamp skink (Egernia coventryi) and the great egret.|$|R
50|$|The genus Pezoporus {{contains}} three Australian species: {{the night}} parrot (Pezoporus occidentalis) and the cryptic ground parrots, the eastern ground parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus)</b> {{and the western}} ground parrot (Pezoporus flaviventris). The night parrot was previously separated in a distinct genus, Geopsittacus. The genus {{is part of the}} tribe Pezoporini.|$|R
50|$|Thirty {{species of}} mammal have been {{recorded}} within the park, including the threatened rufous bettong (Aepyprymnus rufescens), tiger quoll (Dasyurus maculatus), brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa) andsquirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis). Swamps and wet heath are habitat for the threatened eastern ground parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus)</b> and eastern grass owl (Tyto longimembris).|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{ground parrot}} (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus</b> wallicus) occurs in {{fragmented}} populations near the coast in southern Queensland, New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria {{and is considered}} vulnerable on the schedules of the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act. There {{are estimated to be}} 4000 breeding birds. It has become extinct in South Australia.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, two {{subspecies}} {{are recognized}} within the eastern ground parrot, but recent molecular studies show no genetic differentiation {{between the two}} east coast individuals and the individuals from Tasmania. Until recently, the western ground parrot was also considered a subspecies (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus</b> flaviventris) but is now considered a separate species (Pezoporus flaviventris).|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{ground parrot}} (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus)</b> of Australia {{is one of}} only five ground-dwelling parrots in the world, the others being its closest relatives, the western ground parrot (Pezoporus flaviventris), the {{extremely}} rare night parrot (Pezoporus occidentalis), the somewhat closely related Antipodes parakeet (Cyanoramphus unicolor), and the unrelated highly endangered kakapo (Strigops habroptila) from New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty-six bird {{species have been}} recorded, {{including}} 12 species of honeyeater, the endangered eastern bristlebird (Dasyornis brachypterus), the vulnerable ground parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus),</b> two pairs of the vulnerable powerful owl (Ninox strenua), and the vulnerable masked owl (Tyto novaehollandiae). Thirty-five bird species are protected by international bird treaties (JAMBA, CAMBA, and the Bonn Convention) including the endangered pied oystercatcher (Haematopus longirostris) and the vulnerable sooty oystercatcher (Haematopus fuliginosus).|$|R
50|$|The swift parrot (Lathamus discolor) is {{a nationally}} {{endangered}} migratory bird which breeds only in Tasmania but migrates to mainland Australia for wintering. Its habitat requirements {{are similar to}} the glossy black-cockatoo in that it requires shelter in a woodland tree hollow, albeit a smaller size. The habitat requirements of the black breasted button-quail (Turnix melanogaster), and the eastern ground parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus</b> wallicus) are somewhat different in that they forage and live in the rainforest vine thickets and heathland floors respectively.|$|R
50|$|The Noosa Biosphere Reserve {{is a vital}} {{element of}} the BirdLife International {{designated}} Endemic Bird Area (EBA) Eastern Australia zone. The reserve houses over 300 bird species, with a dynamic and diverse population encompassing 44% of documented Australian resident bird species population, as well as migratory bird species. Significant species in the area include the square-tailed kite (Lophoictinia isura), red goshawk (Erythrotriorchis radiates), black-breasted button-quail (Turnix melanogaster), glossy black cockatoo (Calyptohynchus lathami erebus), Coxen’s fig parrot (Cyclopsitta diophthalma coxeni), swift parrot (Lathamus discolor), eastern ground parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus</b> wallicus), and the regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus).|$|R
50|$|The {{woodlands}} in the Noosa Biosphere Reserve {{provide an}} ideal habitat {{for many of}} the bird species mentioned. The glossy black cockatoo (Calyptohynchus lathami erebus) is especially reliant on large woodland tree hollows for breeding. This particular species is currently listed as vulnerable in Queensland, as is the black breasted button-quail (Turnix melanogaster), and the eastern ground parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus</b> wallicus). Species with significantly small populations and recognised as endangered by Queensland Government are the red goshawk (Erythrotriorchis radiates), Coxen’s fig parrot (Cyclopsitta diophthalma coxeni), and the swift parrot (Lathamus discolor).|$|R
25|$|As {{with the}} rest of the South West, there is a fairly low {{diversity}} of bird species. Endemism is similarly low, as most South West bird species are habitat generalists with wide distributions. Exceptions include the red-eared firetail (Stagonopleura oculata) and the white-breasted robin (Eopsaltria georgiana), both of which occur only in the karri forest; the western bristlebird (Dasyornis longirostris), western whipbird (Psophodes nigrogularis nigrogularis) and western ground parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus</b> flaviventris), all of which inhabit the region's heath vegetation; and the noisy scrub-bird (Atrichornis clamosus), which inhabits densely vegetated gullies. Other forest birds include the purple-crowned lorikeet.|$|R
40|$|The {{ground parrot}} (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus)</b> is a {{vulnerable}} species {{that occurs in}} isolated pockets of heathland and sedgeland of Australia. This study used randomly amplified DNA fingerprinting (RAF) to examine genetic diversity in the eastern population of the ground parrot. The seven primers used produced an average of 68 markers per primer, {{and the number of}} unambiguous polymorphic markers per primer averaged 6. 3 (9. 2 %). Overall genetic similarity was 0. 978 ? 0. 03. The low level of genetic diversity revealed by RAF is comparable to the lower end of diversity found in species that are declared endangered...|$|R
5000|$|The Park {{contains}} a wide assortment of bird species {{and up to}} 136 different species are listed. Significant species include eastern grass owl, sea eagles, various parrot species, goshawks, kites, the white-throated needle tail, egrets, herons, wedge-tailed eagles and wrens. The nutmeg mannikin, {{also known as the}} scaly-breasted munia (Lonchura punctulata), is an introduced finch species native to tropical Asia. It is able to tolerate disturbed environments and may pose a threat to native finches through competition. [...] The Park is recorded habitat for the ground parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus</b> wallicus) listed as vulnerable under the NC Act. It is confined to heathlands and sedgelands and has numerous predators including the eastern grass owl, feral cat, brown falcons (Falco berigora) and snakes.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{birds of}} prey exist in South Bruny National Park, {{including}} the white-bellied sea eagle (haliaeetus leucogaster), the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax fleayi) and the grey goshawk (Accipiter novaehollandiae). The goshawk is endangered and very rare, and is found on Partridge Island, part of the South Bruny National Park. Also on Partridge island is a breeding penguin colony, the island provides a secluded refuge and ideal habitat for the flightless bird. [...] Nearby Green Island provides the ideal conditions for the kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) and is an important breeding ground {{of which there are}} very few. The park also supports a rare ground parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus),</b> which survives in the open heathland. Ground parrots are extremely scarce with only three ground dwelling parrot species in existence, all of which are endangered. The preservation of their habitat is critical to the survival of the species, and the undisturbed heathland of the South Bruny National Park provides this refuge.|$|R
40|$|The Ground Parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus)</b> is a {{rare and}} iconic endemic of heathlands in {{southern}} Australia. It is threatened by frequent and widespreadfire. The species has been an integral element {{in the development of}} our understanding of the impacts offire regimes in heathlands and {{is an integral part of}} conservation management of thesefire-prone ecosystems. This long-term study documents the densities of Ground Parrots in three areas of long-unburnt habitat in southernNewSouth Wales. Using area searches and aural surveys, we estimated densities of Ground Parrots at Barren Grounds Nature Reserve–Budderoo National Park (1983 – 2009), Beecroft Weapons Range (1997 – 2008) and Nadgee Nature Reserve (1995 – 2009). At each location, the species occurred in long-unburnt habitat (20 years post-fire), sometimes at high densities (2 birds per 10 ha). We recommend that, in south-eastern Australia, fire should not be used to manipulate the ecological functioning of habitat for the persistence of Ground Parrot populations and conclude that there should be areaspecific adaptive management plans that specify how the important elements of the biodiversity will be conserved and how this will be measured...|$|R
40|$|This study compiles an {{inventory}} of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals in Royal National Park, Garawarra State Conservation Area and Heathcote National Park. It investigates patterns of species occurrence and puts the results into a regional context. Systematic and targeted fi eld surveys were undertaken and previously existing data were reviewed. The surveys detected 283 species. This high species richness {{can be attributed to}} the diversity of habitats present. The Rainforests and Heathlands vegetation formations each support a distinct suite of fauna, while many species only occur on the ocean and/or estuarine shoreline. Rainforests and Heathlands have a restricted distribution in the Sydney basin, and in that context the reserves support large numbers of heath-dependant fauna species. The reserves also have relatively high numbers of at least fi ve threatened species. The fi eld surveys detected seven species not previously documented, including Australasian bittern (Botaurus poiciloptilus) and eastern grass owl (Tyto longimembris). Also notable is the discovery of roosts of eastern horseshoe-bat (Rhinolophus megaphyllus) and little bent-wing-bat (Miniopterus australis). However, many species previously known from the reserves could not be found, such as ground parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus),</b> green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea), parma wallaby (Macropus parma) and platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) ...|$|R
40|$|The eastern ground parrot, <b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus</b> wallicus, is a {{vulnerable}} and elusive species whose ecology is little known. We recorded and analysed {{calls from the}} northern distributional range of the species. Eleven call types were identified in mainland Queensland, 10 of which were common to three study sites located within Noosa National Park. One call type was absent 50 km to the north in Cooloola National Park, where a call type not heard in Noosa was found instead. There may be less mixing of individuals between Noosa and Cooloola areas than within Noosa. Analysis of sonagrams showed that all calls are structurally simple, and generally lie within a frequency band of 2 – 6 kHz. There were calls with gradually ascending notes and syllables, and calls with monotone notes within syllables. The Step Ascending call is common to both Noosa and Cooloola, and modifications were detected in Yuraygir National Park and Fraser island. These call types could have derived from the same ancestral call, {{which may have been}} modified over time, with isolation maintaining the modified calls within populations. Analysis of call patterns has much potential as a conservation tool in uncommon and elusive birds, but research is required to determine the functions of various call types...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of satellite remote sensing and a Geographical Information System (GIS) in defining the habitat of the Ground Parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus)</b> and predicting the habitat suitable for Ground Parrots in Barren Grounds Nature Reserve and Budderoo National Park in New South Wales. The Ground Parrot <b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus</b> is a terrestrial, seed-eating parrot endemic to the coastal heathlands of eastern and southern Australia. Ground ~arrots were once common throughout SE and SW Australia but are now only distributed patchily along the south-east coast of Australia and in SW Western Australia. Data from studies of Ground Parrots by other researchers in Tasmania, Queensland, Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales {{were used to determine}} the habitat requirements of the Ground Parrot. A combination of listening and direct observation was used to determinethe present location of the Ground Parrots. The listening and direct observation were carried out on a irregular basis. Observation data of Ground Parrots from other researchers at Barren Grounds was also used. A four band Landsat Thematic Mapper image was rectified and registered to the Australian Map Grid. A Maximum Likelihood supervised classification of the image was used to allocate pixels to 50 classes. The 50 classes were merged into six landcover classes following examination of between-class and within-class variation. Field sampling was carried out in each of the mapped classes. Quadrats were accurately located using a global positioning system or surveying equipment. Projective foliage cover, height and plant species type were recorded in each quadrat. The results were used to label the six classes as closed heathland, closed graminoid heathland, sedgeland, woodland, forest. Two geographical information systems were used in this study, SPANS GIS and E-RMS. The landcover, fire age, slope, aspect and drainage map along with the location of the ground parrots were imported into the SPANS GIS and E-RMS and used in the modelling of the habitat. Both deductive and inductive modelling techniques were used in this study. The deductive, or knowledge-driven, models use the knowledge of an expert regarding the subject to set up the model parameters. The inductive, or data-driven, models use the training data such as the location of a species in relation to a number variables. The deductive models used were boolean logic, weighted index overlay and fuzzy logic models. The boolean model was simple to implement and visualise and may be used in both E-RMS and SPANS. Weighted Index Overlay and Fuzzy Logic models were more complex to set up and may only be used in SP ANS. They had the distinct advantage of allowing a more flexible combination of maps and providing more useful information. The inductive models used were weights of evidence and decision tree models. The weights of evidence model was implemented in SPANS and the decision tree inductive models in E-RMS. The weights of evidence model wasfound to be the most effective in determining suitable habitat although the success of all the inductive models depend to a large extent on the quality and the quantity of the known locations of the dependent variable, the Ground Parrot. The study illustrated that conventional image classification routines provided a proven method of mapping vegetation with Landsat Thematic Mapper data. The modelling indicated that there is a complex relationship between vegetation structure, drainage, slope and fire history and Ground Parrot populations. Habitat modelling provides a valuable tool for the assessment of suitable habitat for a variety of species. Each method has advantages and disadvantages and both the modellers and the end users need to understand the assumptions that have been made during the development and application of the models. The methods used in this study could also be applied to other areas where Ground Parrots are known but where distribution has not been mapped. The methodology could also be adapted to map habitat suitability for other rare and endangered species...|$|R
40|$|Fire {{management}} {{has become an}} increasingly critical issue in areas of high conservation value such as the pyrogenic buttongrass moorlands in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. The moorland avifauna is depauperate, comprised of only three cryptic, ground-dwelling resident species that depend exclusively upon moorlands in the study area. These include the Southern Emu-wren (Stipiturus malachurus), Striated Fieldwren (Calamanthus fuliginosus), and Ground Parrot (<b>Pezoporus</b> <b>wallicus),</b> {{in addition to a}} small number of species that are typically associated with adjacent forested habitats. This thesis is the first comprehensive study of the buttongrass moorland avifauna and investigated responses to post-fire succession primarily to help guide fire and conservation management. The replicated space-for-time study included sites in low productivity, blanket moorlands at Lake Pedder (n = 12; 2 - 54 years post-fire) and in moderate productivity, eastern moorlands at Lake St Clair (n = 14; 1 - 44 years post-fire). Avifaunal diversity, density, and habitat use over three seasons were quantified and analysed in relation to fire age, soil productivity and composition, structure, and spatial characteristics of habitats at both locations. Observed patterns of avifaunal diversity, density, and habitat use across the two chronosequences were complex and revealed high levels of inter-specific and inter-site variation in relation to habitat variables. Overall, mean densities of the resident species at Lake Pedder increased across the chronosequence, whereas at Lake St Clair they peaked 2 - 8 years post-fire. Mean densities of the non-resident species did not exhibit any consistent trends in relation to fire age. Observations of habitat use demonstrated that the resident and non-resident species used riparian and edge habitats disproportionately to their availability at both locations when compared to the moorland matrix. Surveys of potential arthropod prey resources conducted in matrix and riparian habitats at Lake St Clair indicated that mean abundance and mean energy content across orders were greater in riparian habitats and mid-seral sites, respectively. Thus, patterns of habitat selection by insectivorous species at Lake St Clair also appeared to reflect the differing availabilities of potential arthropod prey. Lastly, a paired before-after-control-impact study conducted at Lake St Clair (n = 4) indicated that hazard-reduction burning in moorlands may result in overall reductions in resident avian densities and increases in non-resident densities in the short-term (< 1. 5 years post-fire). The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to current fire management practices and recommendations are provided to facilitate the conservation of critical resources for the moorland avifauna across the landscape and over time...|$|R
