5|$|Measurements of {{barometric}} {{pressure and the}} pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) {{have been used in}} forecasting since the late 19th century. The larger the change in pressure, especially if more than , the larger the change in weather can be expected. If the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> is rapid, a low pressure system is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain. Rapid pressure rises are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.|$|E
5|$|This formula neglects the {{cracking}} pressure required to open both {{first and second}} stages of the regulator, and <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> due to flow restrictions in the regulator, {{both of which are}} variable depending on the design and adjustment of the regulator, and flow rate, which depends on the breathing pattern of the diver and the gas in use. These factors are not easily estimated, so the calculated value for breathing duration will be more than the real value.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed on October11 {{in the central}} Atlantic Ocean, northeast of the Lesser Antilles and southeast of Bermuda. Two days later, a ship reported strong winds and a rapid <b>pressure</b> <b>drop,</b> indicating a hurricane was in the region; the tropical cyclone was given the name Jig. It moved northwestward, steadily intensifying before turning {{to the north and}} northeast. On October15, Hurricane Jig passed about 300mi (480km) east of Bermuda, and later that day its sustained winds reach peak winds of 115mph (185km/h), although the intensity was uncertain, based on estimates from the Hurricane Hunters. The hurricane began weakening on October16. Jig became an extratropical cyclone later that day and quickly dissipated, never having affected land due to its small size.|$|E

5|$|Allen again {{weakened}} to a Category4 storm due to friction with Mexico and an eyewall replacement cycle, but restrengthened into a Category5 hurricane for a {{third time}} as it moved over the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, keeping this intensity for nearly a full day and with a <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> to , the lowest pressure ever recorded in the western Gulf of Mexico. Shortly before landfall, a dry air mass in the western Gulf of Mexico caused the storm to weaken substantially. Allen made landfall north of Brownsville, Texas as a Category3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). It became extratropical on August 11.|$|E
5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E
5|$|At Valencia {{and other}} regions of eastern Spain, the storm {{generated}} heavy precipitation, while six tornadoes touched down over the Balearic Islands. While approaching {{the coast of the}} Balearic Islands, the warm-core low induced a <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> of 11mbar (0.32inHg) at Palma, Majorca in advance of the tropical cyclone's landfall. Medicanes as small as the one that formed in September1996 are atypical, and often require circumstances different even from those required for regular Mediterranean tropical cyclone formation. Warm low-level advection–transfer of heat through air or sea–caused by a large-scale low over the western Mediterranean was a primary factor in the rise of strong convection. The presence of a mid- to upper-level cut-off cold-core low, a method of formation typical to medicanes, was also key to the development of intense thunderstorms within the cyclone. In addition, interaction between a northeastward-drifting trough, the medicane, and the large-scale also permitted the formation of tornadoes within thunderstorms generated by the cyclone after making landfall.|$|E

5|$|Early on September22, an {{aircraft}} fix located Vera 175km (110mi) north-northeast of Saipan. Throughout {{the course of}} the day, periodic reconnaissance flights into the storm indicated that Vera had begun to rapidly intensify. By 1800UTC later that day, data analysis concluded that the tropical cyclone had reached typhoon intensity. Rapid intensification continued into the following day, as the typhoon's maximum sustained winds and barometric pressure quickly rose and fell, respectively. Concurrently, Vera's size grew to a point at which it spanned 250km (155mi) across. At 0600UTC the following day, Vera achieved its minimum estimated barometric pressure at 895mbar (hPa; 26.43inHg). This indicated a 75mbar (hPa; 2.22inHg) <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> in the preceding 24hours. Upon reaching its minimum pressure, Vera was estimated to have attained winds equivalent to a Category5– the highest classification possible on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The typhoon's winds continued to increase before peaking at 1200UTC on September23, when reconnaissance aircraft reported maximum sustained winds of 305km/h (190mph). Upon peaking in wind speed, Vera was located 645km (400mi) northeast of Guam. The tropical cyclone's ability to quickly intensify was attributed to conducive atmospheric divergence and highly sustainable sea surface temperatures.|$|E

25|$|The blended gases at {{the intake}} to the {{compressor}} {{will be at}} a pressure slightly below ambient, due to losses in the blending tube. This may make it impracticable to use some types of analysis instruments, which rely on a flow of gas through the instrument driven by {{the pressure of the}} measured gas. Oxygen cells are also sensitive to a <b>pressure</b> <b>drop,</b> as they directly measure partial pressure, and this may lead to a mix richer than intended, as the oxygen flow may be set to the partial pressure appropriate for atmospheric pressure, while the measured mixture is at a lower pressure. This can be compensated by using a small sampling pump drawing gas from the blending tupe and delivering it to the instruments, or by allowing for the reduced inlet pressure for oxygen analysis with an in-line sensor cell. This would require a vacuum gauge measuring the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> or abbsolute pressure at the sensor. Partial pressure of oxygen must be correct as a fraction of absolute pressure at the point of measurement.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 8 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Mauritius, 11 - 13 July, 2011. Few studies {{are available in the}} literature on diabatic liquid-vapour flows in inclined tubes. The present paper is dedicated to an experimental study of convective condensation of R 134 a in an 8. 38 mm inner diameter smooth tube in inclined orientations. Flow patterns, heat transfer coefficients and <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> are presented as function of the inclination angle for different mass fluxes and vapour qualities. Tilting influences the flow patterns and thus the heat transfer coefficients for low mass fluxes and low vapour qualities. An optimum inclination angle that leads to the highest heat transfer coefficient can be found for downward flow. The study of the <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> in inclined orientations requires the distinction between the frictional and the gravitational <b>pressure</b> <b>drops.</b> However, a void fraction sensor is necessary to measure the gravitational <b>pressure</b> <b>drops.</b> mp 201...|$|R

25|$|In an {{isothermal}} compression process, the {{gas in the}} system is kept at a constant temperature throughout. This necessarily requires exchange of heat with the gas, otherwise the temperature would rise during charging and drop during discharge. This heat exchange {{can be achieved by}} heat exchangers (intercooling) between subsequent stages in the compressor, regulator and tank. To avoid wasted energy, the intercoolers must be optimised for high heat transfer and low <b>pressure</b> <b>drop.</b> Smaller compressors can approximate {{isothermal compression}} even without intercooling, due to the relatively high ratio of surface area to volume of the compression chamber and the resulting improvement in heat dissipation from the compressor body itself.|$|E
