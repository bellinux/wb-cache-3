Thus Consumer Co-operatives flourished on the NSW coalfields where they helped the miners and their families through many difficult times and bought educational and social benefits. As may have been expected in our mainly <b>primary</b> <b>producing</b> <b>country,</b> Producers ' Societies exceeded Consumers ' Cocoperatives both in numbers and volume of business. The dairying industry in NSW and Queensland afforded the most outstanding examples of producer co-operation, but several large undertakings handling fruit packing and marketing were also important. Many of the Producers' Societies expanded into consumer activities in order to supply their members with goods and services at a cheaper rate. The Poultry Farmers of Queensland, The Eudunda Farmers of South Australia and The Westralian Farmers were examples...|$|E
40|$|The {{collapse}} of primary commodity {{prices in the}} 1980 s has been prolonged and has severely affected many developing countries. While low commodity prices can be partly explained by sluggish demand due to slow growth in the industrialised countries, high interest rates and technological change, this does not seem a complete explanation. This paper examines the evidence in favour of the hypothesis that supply factors have partly been responsible. Many developing countries have faced severe balance of payments difficulties, {{in part due to}} the debt crisis, and have resorted to real exchange rate devaluations in order to boost export earnings. Such devaluations may have boosted export supplies, or prevented downward adjustments in capacity, and therefore put pressure on commodity prices. It also considers the policy implications of this externality, whereby attempts to boost export earnings in one <b>primary</b> <b>producing</b> <b>country</b> adversely affect the prices received by others. ...|$|E
40|$|International trade theory {{suggests}} that trade can be advantageous to the industrial {{as well as to}} the underdeveloped countries. For the latter, specialization and exchange brings about an increase in total productions. Thailand, an underdeveloped country, has for the past decade experienced an unfavorable balance of trade.

40|$|In the Western world, the {{classification}} of industries in the national accounts is universally based on the United Nations International System of Industrial Classificationâ€”the I. S. I. C. This system, while ensuring international standardisation and comparability, has to be modified by any particular country to meet its own particular problems. Departures from the system are common where the unit of classification is the enterprise and even frequently where it is the establishment. What is rare is a rearrangement of industries carred out ad hoc to elucidate the particular economic problems of a country. I believe {{that in the case}} of most <b>primary</b> <b>producing</b> <b>countries</b> there is opportunity and need for greater initiative and flexibility on the part of national accountants in the arrangement of industries. It is characteristic of <b>primary</b> <b>producing</b> <b>countries</b> that the centres of production lie either in agriculture and or mining. This production is generally export oriented.

40|$|The Terms of Trade Debate. A Critical Review The {{notion of}} a secular decline {{in the terms of}} trade of <b>primary</b> <b>producing</b> <b>countries</b> is a {{persistent}} theme in the public discussion of the problems of developing areas, and has been advanced most forcefully in the writtings of Raul Prebisch. A cceptance of such views is implicit in most critiques of the international economic order. However, upon reviewing the literature and available evidence, it is argued that such views are untenable, based as they are upon a faulty interpretation of the welfare implications of movements in the commodity or net barter terms of trade, an uncritical appraisal of the statistical biases involved in terms of trade estimates, and an overly selective survey of actual historical price trends...|$|R

There are at least three reasons for caring about the numbers: they can help to improve understanding of the drug production and consumption problem and identify appropriate policy responses. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{attempted}} to provide an analytical framework for the discussion of problem of debt servicing capacity of the developing countries, which are the major international borrowers today. 1 have concerned on analysing debt servicing problems of a hypothetical <b>primary</b> <b>producing</b> <b>country</b> which has a reasonably ambitions income growth target; which relies on foreign loans at conventional terms financing a considerable portion of its investment program; which has a relatively closed economy and cannot rapidly expand its exports of primary commodities, due to world market conditions.

This study is an attempt to define the “ safe level" of idebtedness which shouldn’t be exceeded.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} explore the {{conditions}} under which producer cartels organized by <b>primary</b> <b>producing</b> <b>countries</b> to increase real external purchasing power (income terms of trade) can most effectively achieve their objectives. To this effect, conventional cartel theory is expanded so as to include the impact of the major institutional factors, with emphasis on centre-periphery (North-South) relationships, the roles played by governments of <b>producing</b> and consuming <b>countries,</b> by transnational enterprises as well as the particular conditions of supply and demand of various commodities. This framework is applied to bauxite, coffee and sugar industries, because each presents unique characteristics. As a principal focus of this study, a comparative analysis of these commodities is undertaken. The analysis demonstrates that a bauxite cartel has the potential to gain large monopoly profits, but the evidence is against the long run profitability and stability of coffee and sugar cartels. The differences in the characteristics of the primary commodities differentiate the behaviour of cartels and the expected outcomes. Ultimately, the benefits of successful cartels will have to be measured by how the financial gains are used to transform internal structures, eliminate poverty, and promote social justice. As well as being useful for the study of primary commodity cartels in general, this analysis can also aid policy makers concerned with producer cartels...|$|R

40|$|This thesis principally {{studies the}} {{determination}} of UK export performance between the wars. Several improvements to the measurement of sterling's nominal and {{real effective exchange rate}} in the period are implemented, and the path of the exchange rate is related to UK and foreign exchange rate policies. The nature of competitiveness and the demand and supply mechanisms by which it may influence exports are discussed. In the light of this, and the commodity and geographical breakdown of UK exports, we suggest alternative measures of competitiveness which may appropriately be tested in econometric work. Aggregate UK export volume and price equations for the inter- war period are then estimated. Competitiveness, which is in turn influenced by the exchange rate, and the economic position of <b>primary</b> <b>producing</b> <b>countries,</b> are found to have had significant effects on UK export performance. Similarly specified equations are estimated for UK exports in eight industrial sectors. Distinctive characteristics of sectors may lead to substantial divergences between sectoral and aggregate behaviour. This is confirmed in further work on UK coal exports. Nevertheless, measures of the price of UK exports relative to the price of exports of other industrial countries generally give explanations of UK export performance which are superior to other competitiveness measures. A substantial statistical appendix containing data on, inter alia, UK and foreign exchange rates, trade volumes and values (with geographcial and commodity breakdown), labour costs and prices, together with the sources and methods used in their construction, is provided both for historical interest and to facilitate replication of results and further research. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} and neo-classical theories {{of international trade}} are subject to critical analysis. Thus it is shown that policy recommendations based on such theories are not justified because rigidities in the economic systems would prevent many countries from attaining the degree of diversification which according to theory should follow under free trade conditions. Specialization along <b>primary</b> <b>producing</b> lines is desirable only if it assures countries adopting it, full employment of human resources or, at least, an equitable share of world income-conditions attained only under exceptional and transitory circumstances. It follows that beyond certain point further economic progress in such countries requires industrialization and protection. This {{part of the study}} supplies a logical and theoretical justification for policies which most underdeveloped countries have already adopted against the recommendations of many orthodox economists. A statistical section shows that certain well known empirical generalizations abput the development of international trade following industrialization are not valid. International trade appears as a prerequisite of industrialization rather than its result or by product. The historical expansion in the trade of the older industrial countries is only an index of their success in obtaining access to resources without which industrialization would not have been possible. Also the common belief that trade somehow will increase whenever a country industrializes –or attempts- is unwarranted and proven {{by the fact that the}} reciprocal trade of the older industrial nations has tended to decline, both in absolute and relative terms, while their trade with <b>primary</b> <b>producing</b> <b>countries</b> has steadily expanded. The role of international trade in economic growth is then re appraised. Trade is shown to be an essential part of industrialization as its effects is that of supplementing domestic resources and making diversification possible. Since most countries have unbalanced bases of natural resources, their industrialization is dependent on attaining minimum levels of international trade. This conclusion is important for underdeveloped countries bent on industrializing, Economic integration with countries having complementary resources is shown to be the answer whenever the trade prospects of a country indicate that industrialization may be infeasibl...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} {{argued that the}} burden of {{providing}} surplus in the <b>primary</b> <b>producing</b> <b>countries</b> falls upon agriculture. By extracting this surplus to be utilized in {{clearing the way for}} rapid growth, economic development would be sustained. This raises an empirical question: how can agricultural production be increased. The logic of increasing agricultural productivity may be explained in terms of investment allocation among sectors, and resource allocation within the agricultural sector. Rapid growth in an early stage of economic development might be achieved through reallocation of investment in favour of agriculture. In a second stage agricultural resources must efficiently be allocated to ensure continuous development. These two aspects are investigated and tested with respect to the Egyptian economy, in an attempt to identify the possibility of increasing agricultural productivity under the present economic structure. The study is therefore divided into an introduction and two broad parts. In the introduction we briefly sketch the characteristics of Egyptian agriculture in order to recognise its role in the national economy and to investigate the implication of the present agricultural policy. Part one (two chapters) is devoted to testing investment allocation efficiency among the commodity sectors. In chapter II, the arguments for and against agricultural development are recalled to be analysed with respect to empirical evidence from the past. The necessity of agricultural development is investigated to be tested against the conditions under which the <b>primary</b> <b>producing</b> <b>countries</b> operate. A three sectoral approach emphasises on creating agricultural surplus {{in the early stages of}} economic development is suggested in Chapter III, to be tested with respect to the Egyptian economy during the period 1960 - 65. Minimum capital-output ratio criterion is applied in reallocating investment among commodity sectors. Comparison between the actual outcome and that resulted from investment reallocation is made to justify the suggested approach. An input-output table is employed to show the interrelation between sectors and to ensure overall balance. A demand - supply table is used to determine sectoral surplus (or deficit). Part two comprises five chapters to be devoted to testing resource allocation efficiency within the agricultural sector. In chapter IV, both technical and economic theory of production are reviewed with special referrence to the popular forms of production function analysing their limitations in both theoretical and practical terms, and showing the major statistical constraints to the application of production function approach. The previous empirical investigations of production behaviour in Egyptian agriculture are survied in chapter V. In the remaining chapters, an attempt is made to identify agricultural potentiality in terms of resource allocation efficiency. The whole area is divided into five regions. North & West Delta, Middle Delta, East Delta, Middle Egypt and Upper Egypt. Production behaviour is examined for each region separately to test for resource allocation efficiency among regions. A production function approach is adopted to test technical efficiency. Three algebraic forms; linear function, Cobb-Douglas function and constant Elasticity of Substitution function are tested against the numerical observations. A time series production function for the period 1960 - 75 is estimated in chapter VI. A separate production function (i. e. disaggrative production function) is fitted for the major crops (cotton, rice and wheat) in each region. Chapter VII is devoted to testing technical efficiency with respect to the various farm size classes and tenure forms. Estimates are based on cross sectional data collected directly from the farmers and confined to cotton, the major single crop. A two-stage model is applied to test resource allocation efficiency among as well as within stages of cultivation. A management index is derived to examine its impact on large farms efficiency. In the final chapter (chapter VIII) a maximisation approach for constrained extrema is adopted to determine the optimum level of output (i. e. maximum profit) for the various classes of farm size to be utilised in identifying the productivity gap under the present situation and to find out the relevant class of farm size to Egyptian agriculture. The implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that commodity price variability causes problems for <b>primary</b> <b>producing</b> and dependent <b>countries.</b> This paper tests the effects of price uncertainty (volatility) on economic growth. The model is constructed using a yearly panel data for the ten biggest countries in South America. The results show that output per worker varies enormously across countries, even within the region. Our analysis shows that exogenous shocks continue having a significant negative effect on growth on developing countries. Despite volatility series are not constant through time, we found a homogenous negative effect within the region, but it is heterogeneous when we apply a causality test. The effect is commonly observed in economic time series and it shows that growth rates are significantly reduced by large discrete negative commodity price shocks. Our analysis documented that the impact on productivity (output per worker) is driven through capital formation and foreign investment, as well as, by differences in what we call ‘social infrastructure’ (i. e. institutions and government policies). ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Ghana’s cocoa {{industry from}} the innovation systems perspective. Cocoa {{is the major}} cash crop of Ghana. Its importance is {{not only in the}} contribution of about 25 % annually of the total foreign exchange earnings but also on account of being the source of livelihoods for many rural farmers and the related actors in the value chain. The critical actors in the innovation system are the farmers, the researchers, the buyers, the transporters, public officers, consumers and the policy makers. By the roles and functions they perform, they impact on the dynamics of the cocoa industry. The paper describes the trends in cocoa production and processing and highlights the key characteristics and implications. It discusses the policy reforms in the cocoa industry and the major drivers of the reforms. The Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) {{is one of the biggest}} public institutions in Ghana and its subsidiaries are major actors in the production process of cocoa for export. The key reforms in the policies governing the industry were the dissolution of the monopoly of Produce Buying Company and the deregulation of cocoa purchasing to allow Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs) to enter the business in 1992 / 93 crop season. There was also the dismantling and re-organization of the Cocoa Services Division into two separate units—the Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease Control Unit (CSSVDCU) and the Seed Production Unit (SPU). The processing of cocoa into cocoa butter, cocoa paste and confectioneries is an important component of the value chain especially with the national goal of processing 50 % of cocoa before export.

40|$|What is the {{appropriate}} economic policy for <b>primary</b> commodity <b>producing</b> developing <b>countries</b> given that industrialized countries are specialized {{in the production of}} technological progress? Integrating the concept of product life cycle to the static theory of comparative advantage, Harry Johnson has argued that free trade will, by spreading the technology, dissolve the monopoly in technology, and thus constitutes the only policy capable of transmitting growth from one country to another. This article criticizes this thesis on the following points: 1)  A rigorous interpretation of the concept of product life cycle and of the underlying assumptions suggests that only industrialized countries present the necessary conditions for the location of the production of exportable technological progress. 2)  It follows that the monopoly of the industrialized countries is not temporary but dynamic and self renewing. 3)  Free trade, in this case, will only reinforce the negative effects of this monopoly on international specialization and, therefore, reinforce the disparities between industrialized and developing countries. Given the absence of a supranational authority which could intervene against this monopoly, it is appropriate to consider the limits of the bilateral monopoly policy which the developing countries will apply, based on their primary commodities, and the role that OPEC can play in this context. ...|$|R
