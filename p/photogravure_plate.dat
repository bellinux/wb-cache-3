50|$|Photogravure {{registers}} a {{wide variety}} of tones, through the transfer of etching ink from an etched copper plate to special dampened paper run through an etching press. The unique tonal range comes from photogravure's variable depth of etch, that is, the shadows are etched many times deeper than the highlights. Unlike half-tone processes which merely vary the size of dots, the actual quantity and depth of ink wells are varied in a <b>photogravure</b> <b>plate</b> and are often blended into a smooth tone by the printing process. Photogravure practitioners such as Peter Henry Emerson and others brought the art to a high standard in the late 19th century. This continued with the work of Alfred Stieglitz in the early 20th century, especially in relation to his publication Camera Work. This publication also featured the photogravures of Alvin Langdon Coburn who was a fine gravure printer and envisioned his photographic work as gravures rather than other photo-based processes. The speed and convenience of silver-gelatin photography eventually displaced photogravure which fell into disuse after the Edward S. Curtis gravures in the 1920s. One of the last major portfolios of fine art photogravures was Paul Strand's Photographs from Mexico from 1940, reissued as The Mexican Portfolio in 1967 by DeCapo Press. Many years later, photogravure has experienced a revival in the hands of Aperture and Jon Goodman, who studied it in Europe. Photogravure is now actively practiced in several dozen workshops around the world.|$|E

50|$|Born in Cleveland, Steiner studied {{chemistry}} at Dartmouth, but in 1921 {{entered the}} Clarence H. White School of Modern Photography. White helped Steiner {{in finding a}} job at the Manhattan Photogravure Company, and Steiner worked on making <b>photogravure</b> <b>plates</b> of scenes from Robert Flaherty's Nanook of the North. Not long after, Steiner's work as a freelance photographer in New York began, working mostly in advertising and for publications like Ladies' Home Journal. Through the encouragement of fellow photographer Paul Strand, Steiner joined the left-of-center Film and Photo League around 1927. He was also to influence the photography of Walker Evans, giving him guidance, technical assistance, and one of his view cameras.|$|R
50|$|Fligely {{was born}} in Janów Lubelski, Galicia, then part of the Duchy of Warsaw. He {{attended}} the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt and from 1836 served as an officer at the quartermaster general's staff in Vienna, achieving the rank of Field Marshal Second Lieutenant in 1865 (comparable to Lieutenant-General in the United States Army). In 1853 he was appointed {{executive director of the}} k.k. institute of military geography. A pioneer in meridian arc measurement theory, Fligely provided for the triangulation of Hungary, Transylvania, and adjacent Wallachia, {{as well as for the}} creation of quality maps in the third land survey of the Austro-Hungarian lands from 1869 onwards. He decisively promoted modern cartography by the application of <b>photogravure</b> <b>plates</b> and the photographic reproduction of maps.|$|R

50|$|As with The Golden Age, {{the first}} edition of Dream Days was un-illustrated; again like the prior volume, a {{subsequent}} edition of Dream Days was published with illustrations by Maxfield Parrish, also from John Lane. Lane's first intention was to print colour plates but he was not satisfied with the colour reproductions of Parrish's pictures. Instead Lane chose a new photogravure reproduction process that produced black-and-white results superior to the halftone images in the 1899 edition of The Golden Age. The Parrish-illustrated edition of Dream Days was issued in London and New York by The Bodley Head in 1902; it contained ten full-page illustrations (one for each of the eight selections plus frontispiece and title page) and six tailpieces. The quality of the images in Dream Days inspired Lane to issue a matching edition of The Golden Age, with improved <b>photogravure</b> <b>plates,</b> in 1904.|$|R

50|$|The still-more-ambitious Carte du Ciel {{component}} of the programme was undertaken {{by some of the}} participating observatories, but neither completed nor even started by others. The charts proved to be excessively expensive to photograph and reproduce, generally via engraved copper <b>plates</b> (<b>photogravure),</b> and many zones were either not completed or properly published. The plates which were taken generally still exist, but cover only half of the sky. They are typically archived at their original observatories. A very few plates have recently been re-measured and re-analysed with the availability of the Hipparcos Catalogue data (see below).|$|R
50|$|Publishing in China {{dates from}} the {{invention}} of woodblock printing around the eighth century CE and was greatly expanded with the invention of movable clay type in the eleventh century. From the tenth to the twelfth century, Kaifeng, Meishan, Hangzhou, and Jianyang were major printing centers. In the nineteenth century, China acquired movable lead type and <b>photogravure</b> printing <b>plates</b> and entered the age of modern book and magazine printing. The largest of the early publishing houses were the Commercial Press (Shangwu Yinshuguan), established in 1897, and the China Publishing House (Zhonghua Shuju), established in 1912, {{both of which were}} still operating in 1987. Following the May Fourth Movement of 1919, publishers, especially those associated with various groups of intellectuals, proliferated. During the Chinese civil war, New China Booksellers (Xinhua Shudian) published a large amount of Marxist literature and educational materials in the communist-controlled areas. On the eve of the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, there were over 700 New China Booksellers offices.|$|R
