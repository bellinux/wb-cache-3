40|$|Drug {{delivery}} is generally concerned with improving the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic molecules. This {{can be done}} by improving distribution to target tissues, improving biological retention time, co-delivery of multiple therapeutics, and decrease in the total amount of therapeutic necessary to get the desired effect. Because they are highly tunable and synthetically addressable, polymeric particulate carriers represent a promising approach for improved delivery of therapeutics, and are the subject of this dissertation. In particular, the development is described for degradable materials, which are capable of releasing encapsulated cargo following uptake by cells and subsequent trafficking to endosomal vesicles. Degradation is responsive to acidic or oxidizing environments found in targeted tissues. Materials developed include hydrogels, hydrophobic microparticles, and liquid-filled microcapsules. Chapter 1 introduces various delivery strategies for polymeric delivery vehicles and some of their main applications. Additionally, the modes of environmentally responsive degradation are reviewed, with a focus on relevant design criteria for materials intended for delivery applications. In Chapter 2, the synthesis of a multifunctional acid-sensitive hydrogel carrier is described for immunotherapy applications. Antigen and an immunostimulatory adjuvant are encapsulated in particles decorated with targeting antibodies and the effectiveness of stimulation and targeting are assayed. Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the synthesis and characterization of a hydrophobic acid-sensitive delivery vehicle based on acetal-modified dextran.

The “halo” could be removed by prolonged exposure to the carbonate-thioglycolate solution. Virions obtained by this treatment, however, possessed low infectivity and no detectable RNA polymerase activity.

40|$|The {{deposition}} of Pd and Pt nanoparticles by {{atomic layer deposition}} (ALD) has been studied extensively in recent years for the synthesis of nanoparticles for catalysis. For these applications, {{it is essential to}} synthesize nanoparticles with well-defined sizes and a high density on large-surface-area supports. Although the potential of ALD for synthesizing active nanocatalysts for various chemical reactions has been demonstrated, insight into how to control the nanoparticle properties (i. e. size, composition) by choosing suitable processing conditions is lacking. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the reaction mechanisms during the nucleation stage of metal ALD. In this work, nanoparticles synthesized with four different ALD processes (two for Pd and two for Pt) were extensively studied by transmission electron spectroscopy. Using these datasets as a starting point, the growth characteristics and reaction mechanisms of Pd and Pt ALD relevant for the synthesis of nanoparticles are discussed. The results reveal that ALD allows for the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> with control of the particle size, although it is also shown that the particle size distribution is strongly dependent on the processing conditions.

In this context, the controlled <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> in a metastable polymorphic state is of some {{interest for the}} delivery of active substances. In the present study, tristearin particles stabilized with three α-polymorph preserving emulsifier regimes ((I) sodium glycocholate/saturated long-chain phospholipids, (II) sodium glycocholate, (III) poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)) were investigated concerning {{the stability of the}} metastable α-polymorph after controlled crystallization of the particles from the melt. Upon long-term storage, the α-polymorph was preserved best in PVA-stabilized dispersions, followed by those stabilized with the glycocholate/phospholipid mixture and finally those stabilized solely with the bile salt. In particular for rapidly crystallized nanoparticles, the formation of an α-polymorph with highly reduced lamellarity was observed. According to time-/temperature-resolved synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis with simultaneous DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) studies this less-ordered α-polymorph transformed into the common, lamellar α-form upon heating. Although the presence of the less-ordered form is probably related to the extraordinarily high stability of the metastable α-polymorph observed in some of the dispersions, it could not completely prevent the transition into the stable β-polymorph. The higher the transition temperature of the less-ordered α-form to the ordered one, the slower was the polymorphic transition to the stable β-polymorph. To estimate the polymorphic stability of the differently stabilized particles upon isothermal long-term storage, standard DSC measurements on samples stored at 23 °C for four weeks seem to be of predictive value...|$|E

The encapsulator was used for <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> and the most appropriate particles were prepared by encapsulation nozzle with size of 300 µm. Moreover, probiotics viability was monitored by Flow Cytometry, Fluorescence Microscopy and by cultivation (CFU method). Viability of probiotics was monitored during long-term storage in selected food for infants. The appropriate shelf life of non-lyophilized alginate particles in real food have been set at 1 to 2 months. Lyophilized alginate particles could be stored for more than 3 months. Finally, {{the stability of the}} particles and viability of encapsulated and non-encapsulated cells in the gastrointestinal tract conditions were also examined.

40|$|The use of low-density {{silica aerogel}} {{as the primary}} capture cell {{technology}} for the NASA Discovery mission Stardust to Comet Wild- 2 [1] is a strong motivation for researchers within the Meteoritics community to develop techniques to handle this material. The unique properties of silica aerogel allow dust particles to be captured at hypervelocity speeds and to remain partially intact. The same unique properties present difficulties in the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> for analysis. Using tools borrowed from microbiologists, we have developed techniques for robustly extracting captured hypervelocity dust particles and their residues from aerogel collectors[2 - 3]. It is important not only to refine these extraction techniques but also to develop protocols for analyzing the captured particles. Since Stardust does not return material to Earth until 2006, researchers must either analyze particles that are impacted in the laboratory using light-gasgun facilities [e. g. 41 or examine aerogel collectors that have been exposed in low-Earth orbit (LEO) [5]. While there are certainly benefits in laboratory shots, i. e. accelerating known compositions of projectiles into aerogel, the LEO capture particles offer the opportunity to investigate real particles captured under real conditions. The aerogel collectors used in this research {{are part of the}} NASA Orbital Debris Collection Experiment that was exposed on the MIR Space Station for 18 months [5]. We have developed the capability at the UCB Space Sciences Laboratory to extract tiny volumes of aerogel that completely contain each impact event, and to mount them on micromachined fixtures {{so that they can be}} analyzed with no interfering support (Fig. 1). These aerogel keystones simultaneously bring the terminal particle and the particle track to within 10 m (15 g cm-) of the nearest aerogel surface.

Hereby, anomalous situations can be detected {{in a timely manner}} and responsive action can be initiated to prevent an escalation into an event of severe consequence to society. In order to verify non-nuclear weapon states’ compliance with the non-proliferation treaty (NPT), international authorities such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) conduct inspections at facilities dealing with fissile or fertile nuclear materials. One measure consists of collection of swipe samples through inspectors for later analysis of collected nuclear material traces in the laboratory. Highly sensitive mass spectrometric methods, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), provide a means to detect traces from nuclear material handling activities that provide indication of undeclared use of the facility. There are, however, no relevant (certified) reference materials available that can be used as calibration or quality control standards. Therefore, an aerosol-generation based process was established at Forschungszentrum Jülich for the production of spherical, mono-disperse uranium oxide micro-particles with accurately characterized isotopic compositions and amounts of uranium in the picogram range. The synthesized particles are studied with respect to their suitability as (certified) reference material in ultra-trace analysis with the uranium isotopic composition and uranium content as property values. For a reference material homogeneity and stability of the material is of high importance.

40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) {{represents a}} promising method {{for the treatment}} and prevention of disease. Due to the tremendous potential of RNAi as a therapeutic strategy, there has been significant interest {{in the development of}} delivery vehicles which could efficiently deliver siRNA and reduce the expression of a protein of interest. Unfortunately, translation of the potential of siRNA into the clinic is limited by the lack of safe and effective delivery systems. Because of their tunability and synthetic addressability, acid–degradable polymeric materials represent a promising approach for the delivery of siRNA and are the subject of this dissertation. Acid–sensitive systems have particularly desirable characteristics, as payload release can be triggered in response to endosomal acidification upon uptake. In particular, we describe the development, functionalization, and biological evaluation of biodegradable polymer systems which can efficiently deliver siRNA therapeutics to non–phagocytic cells. Specific emphasis is placed on the development of materials that have optimal physicochemical properties for pulmonary delivery. Chapter 1 introduces various delivery strategies for siRNA therapeutics and discusses the basics of RNA interference. Additionally, the field of polymeric particulate siRNA carriers is reviewed, with an overview of relevant design criteria for materials intended for pulmonary administration. The advantages of systems capable of triggered payload release are discussed, with an emphasis on acid–sensitive carrier systems. Two acid–sensitive particle systems developed by our group are described. In Chapter 2, the synthesis of acid–sensitive, acrylamide–based microparticles containing a cell–penetrating peptide (CPP) is discussed. Particles functionalized with a polyarginine CPP are prepared and evaluated for their ability to deliver a model therapeutic payload to non–phagocytic cells. The importance of CPP incorporation on cellular uptake in vitro is investigated in lung epithelial cells. The modification of the microparticles with CPPs greatly improved their uptake by non–phagocytic cells in culture without inducing any cytotoxic effects. Chapter 3 discusses the role of particle size and functionalization with cationic CPPs on pulmonary delivery using hydrogel particles. The optimal particle design parameters for pulmonary delivery are investigated and the fate of model particles following intratracheal administration is studied by several techniques. Particles are characterized to determine their in vivo behavior in terms of lung retention, localization within specific cell types, and potential for inducing inflammatory responses. We found that altering both size and surface functionalization significantly affected the in vivo behavior of the particle system. In Chapter 4, we describe the synthesis of a second–generation biocompatible, acid–sensitive particle system for siRNA delivery. The synthesis of spermine–modified acetalated–dextran (Spermine–Ac–DEX) is presented and the <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> with high siRNA loading efficiency is described. The ability of these particles to silence protein expression in vitro is investigated. Spermine–Ac–DEX particles demonstrated efficient gene knockdown in a model cell line with minimal toxicity. Chapter 5 investigates the synthesis and biological evaluation of functionalizable, acetal–modified dextran, a modular system with tunable functionality, degradation rate, and degree of modification. The preparation of acid–degradable, amine–functionalized dextran is described and the role of type of amine modification (primary, secondary, or tertiary amine) and degradation rate on the efficacy of siRNA delivery is studied in vitro. Altering both the type of amine as well as the degradation rate significantly affected the transfection efficiency.

In addition, {{the use of}} chitosan was shown to enhance the action of other known adjuvants, such as CTB or Quil-A. Collectively, the results presented herein indicate that chitosan has excellent potential as a mucosal adjuvant. We have evaluated a number of absorption enhancers for their adjuvant activity in vivo. Polyornithine was shown to engender high scrum immune reasons to nasally delivered antigens, with higher molecular weight polyornithine facilitating the best results. We have demonstrated {{for the first time}} that vitamin E TPGS can act as mucosal adjuvant. Deoxycholic acid, cyclodextrins and acylcarnitines were also identified as effective mucosal adjuvants and showed enhanced immune responses to nasally delivered TT, DT and Yersinia pestis V and F 1 antigens. Previously, none of these agents, common in their action as absorption enhancing agents, have been shown to have immunopotentiating activity for mucosal immunisation. We have successfully developed novel surface modified microspheres using chitosan as an emulsion stabiliser during the preparation of PLA microspheres. It was found that immune responses could be substantially increased, effectively exploiting the immunopenetrating characteristics of both chitosan and PLA microspheres in the same delivery vehicle. In the same study, comparison of intranasal and intramuscular routes of administration showed that with these formulations, the nasal route could be as effective as intramuscular delivery, highlighting the potential of mucosal administration for these particulate delivery systems. Chitosan was co-administered with polymer microspheres. It was demonstrated that this strategy facilitates markedly enhanced immune responses in both magnitude and duration following intramuscular administration. We conclude that this combination shows potential for single dose administration of vaccines. In another study, we have shown that the addition of chitosan to alum adsorbed TT was able to enhance immune responses. PLA micro/nanospheres were prepared and characterised with discreet particle size ranges. A smaller particle size was shown to facilitate higher scrum IgG responses following nasal administration. A lower antigen loading was additionally identified as being preferential for the induction of immune responses in combination with the smaller particle size. This may be due to the fact that the number of particles will be increased when antigen loading is low, which may in turn facilitate a more widespread uptake of particles. PLA lamellar particles were prepared and characterised. Adsorbed TT was evaluated for the potential to engender immune responses in vivo. These formulations were shown to generate effective immune responses following intramuscular administration. Positively charged polyethylcyanoacrylate and PLA nanoparticies were designed and characterised and their potential as delivery vehicles for DNA vaccines was investigated. Successful <b>preparation</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> with narrow size distribution and positive surface charge (imparted by the inclusion of chitosan) was achieved. In the evaluation of antibody responses to DNA encoded antigen in the presence of alum administered intranasally, discrimination between the groups was only seen following intramuscular boosting with the corresponding protein. Our study showed that DNA vaccines in the presence of either alum or Quil-A may advantageously influence priming of the immune system by a mucosal route. The potential for the combination of adjuvants, Quil-A and chitosan, to enhance antibody responses to plasmid encoded antigen co-administered with the corresponding protein antigen was shown and this is worthy of further investigation. The findings here have identified novel adjuvants and approaches to vaccine delivery. In particular, chitosan or vitamin E TPGS are shown here to have considerable promise as non-toxic, safe mucosal adjuvants. In addition, biodegradable mucoadhesive delivery systems, surface modified with chitosan in a single step process, may have application for other uses such as drug and gene delivery...|$|E
