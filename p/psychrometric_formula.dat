40|$|There the thermo-physical {{processes}} in the semiconductor thermocouple sensors of air humudity have been studied in view to the improvement of their operating characteristics and {{to the creation of}} sensors without tne moistening system. The dependence of psychrometric difference of air temperatures on the thermo-physical, structural and mode factors of semiconductor thermocouple micromodules has been ascertained. The correction factor of <b>psychrometric</b> <b>formula</b> has been obtained. The sensors of air humidity without the moistening system have been developed and have been introduced. The sensors may be used for control over the temperature-humidity characteristics of airAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

It became known as the [...] "Magna Carta of Psychrometrics." [...] This document tied together the concepts of relative humidity, absolute humidity, and dew-point temperature, thus making it possible to design air-conditioning systems to precisely fit the requirements at hand.|$|R
