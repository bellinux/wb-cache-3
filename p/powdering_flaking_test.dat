40|$|A {{feasibility}} study for producing aluminum <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> from aluminum foil scrap by dry ball milling under an inert argon {{with a few}} % of oxygen was carried out. It {{was found that the}} pieces of aluminum foil scrap were laminated to each other, elongated by micro-forging of the falling balls, fragmented into small pieces of foil and finally formed into <b>flake</b> <b>powder,</b> during the ball milling. A larger ball is more beneficial to the milling of aluminum foil into the <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> due to the large impact energy during the falling of the ball. Intermediate stops during the ball milling produced a finer aluminum <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> than non-stop milling for up to 25 h due to cooling of the vial. A larger amount of stearic acid reduces friction between the foil or the balls and vial wall, thus give less milling efficiency, 3 wt. % of stearic acid as additive being verified as the optimum content. The aluminum <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> produced by the dry ball milling of aluminum foil scrap can be applied to fingerprint detection or to aerate light-weight concrete. # 2000 Elsevier Science S.

The SDF charge {{consisted of a}} 0. 5 -g spherical PETN booster, surrounded by 1 -g of fuel <b>powder</b> (<b>flake</b> Aluminum). Detonation of the booster charge creates a high-temperature, high-pressure source (PETN detonation products gases) that both disperses the fuel and heats it. Combustion ensues when the fuel mixes with air. The gas phase is governed by the gas-dynamic conservation laws, while the particle phase obeys the continuum mechanics laws for heterogeneous media. The two phases exchange mass, momentum and energy according to inter-phase interaction terms. The kinetics model used an empirical particle burn relation. The thermodynamic model considers the air, fuel and booster products to be of frozen composition, while the Al combustion products {{are assumed to be}} in equilibrium.

The effect of chitosan concentration and purity, {{as well as}} the influence of temperature, ionic strength (salt) and impact of a solid physical support in the medium are examined. Results show that the antibacterial activity of neat chitosan: (i) requires partial solubilisation; (ii) can be promoted by environmental factors such as adequate temperature range, ionic strength and the presence of a solid physical support that may facilitate the attachment of bacteria; (iii) depends on bacterial species, with a sensitivity order of E. coli > L. innocua > S. aureus; and (iv) increases with chitosan concentration, up to a critical point above which this effect decreases. The latter may be due to remaining proteins in chitosan acting as nutrients for bacteria therefore limiting its antibacterial activity.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} possible neurotoxic {{effects in}} groups of aluminium pot room and foundry workers, aluminium welders, and {{a small group of}} workers exposed to aluminium in the production of <b>flake</b> <b>powder.</b>  METHODS—Exposure to aluminium was evaluated with aluminium concentrations in blood and urine as well as a questionnaire. The groups exposed to aluminium were compared with a group of mild steel welders. Neurotoxic effects were studied with mood and symptom questionnaires and several psychological and neurophysiological tests.  RESULTS—The pot room and foundry workers showed very low aluminium uptake as their aluminium concentrations in blood and urine were close to normal, and no effects on the nervous system were detected. The group of workers exposed to <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> had high concentrations of aluminium in blood and urine, even higher than those of the aluminium welders. However, aluminium could not be shown to affect the functioning of the nervous system in <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> producers. Although significant effects could not be shown in the present analysis of the data on welders, the performance of the welders exposed to high concentrations of aluminium was affected according to the analyses in the original paper from this group.  CONCLUSIONS—For the pot room and foundry workers no effects related to the exposure to aluminium could be found. For the group of <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> producers exposed for a short term no effects on the nervous systems were evident despite high levels of exposure. Due to the high concentrations of aluminium in the biological samples of this group, measures to reduce the exposure to aluminium are recommended, as effects on the central nervous system might develop after protracted exposures.
