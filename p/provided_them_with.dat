5|$|For {{several decades}} after the uprising, Chiprovtsi and the region {{remained}} desolate. In 1699, the Ottomans attempted to settle 1,238 anti-Habsburg Hungarian rebels in those lands and <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> 5-year tax exemptions, but this proved unsuccessful as in 1717 the same Hungarians were moved to the Rousse barracks and sent to fight at Niš.|$|E
5|$|Lebrón {{eventually}} {{moved to}} San Juan, where she studied sewing and continued her correspondence with Paoli.

5|$|Though {{initially}} {{wary of the}} FROLINAT, Gaddafi {{had come}} to see by 1970 the organization as useful to his needs. With the support of Soviet bloc nations, particularly East Germany, he trained and armed the insurgents, and <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> weapons and funding. On 27 August 1971 Chad accused Egypt and Libya of backing a coup against then-president François Tombalbaye by recently amnestied Chadians.|$|E
5|$|In early 1941 the 6th Division and ICorps {{headquarters}} {{took part}} in the ill-fated Allied expedition to defend Greece from a German invasion. The corps' commander, Lieutenant-General Thomas Blamey, and Prime Minister Menzies both regarded the operation as risky, but agreed to Australian involvement after the British Government <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> briefings which deliberately understated the chance of defeat. The Allied force deployed to Greece was much smaller than the German force in the region and the defence of the country was compromised by inconsistencies between Greek and Allied plans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, there were rumours about {{surviving}} mammoths in Alaska. In October 1899, Henry Tukeman detailed his {{killing of a}} mammoth in Alaska and his subsequent donation of the specimen to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. The museum denied the story. Bengt Sjögren believed that the myth began when the American biologist Charles Haskins Townsend travelled in Alaska, saw Eskimos trading mammoth tusks, asked if there were still living mammoths in Alaska, and <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> a drawing of the animal.|$|E

The effort paid off and approval was given to move ahead with production.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} Summer Olympics, Solo {{received}} a public warning from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) after a June 15 urine test concluded the banned substance Canrenone had been detected. Solo {{said in a statement}} she had been prescribed a pre-menstrual medication and was not aware it contained any banned substances. She cooperated with the USADA and <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> the necessary information to prove that it was a mistake. Her story checked out and she was cleared with a public warning. The positive test did not require Solo to withdraw from any pre-Olympic matches.|$|E
5|$|Princip, Grabež, and Čabrinović left Belgrade by boat on 28 May and {{traveled}} along the Sava River to Šabac where they handed the small card to Captain Popović of the Serbian Border Guard. Popović, in turn, <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> {{a letter to}} Serbian Captain Prvanović, and filled out a form {{with the names of}} three customs officials whose identities they could assume and thereby receive discounted train tickets for the ride to Loznica, a small border town.|$|E

5|$|Slaves {{had special}} sexual {{restrictions}} and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in pederastic relationships ("A slave {{shall not be}} the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash."), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae ("A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools."). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to protect their sons from unwanted advances <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> a slave guard, called a paidagogos, to escort the boy in his travels.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mongols did not {{initially}} upset the existing order at the borderlands as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song. For the next dozen years, they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land, which not only <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India. The Mongols set up military garrisons, manned mostly by Turkic-speaking Muslims from Central Asia, in 37 circuits of the former Dali Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Two {{attempts}} by the Japanese to extend their defensive perimeter {{in the south and}} central Pacific were thwarted in the battles of Coral Sea (May 1942) and Midway (June 1942). These two strategic victories for the Allies <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> an opportunity to take the initiative and launch an offensive against the Japanese somewhere in the Pacific. The Allies chose the Solomon Islands, specifically the southern Solomon Islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida as the location for their first offensive.|$|E

Ricketts, suffering {{as a result of the}} breakup of his long-term relationship with a married woman in Monterey, was glad to get away too. They planned to collect specimens from the rock and tide pools and the shore line uncovered between tides which would allow them build up a picture of the macro level ecosystem in the Gulf. The preserved specimens of the fauna they collected could be identified and catalogued or sold on their return.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} for assisting Zangi, the Abbasid authorities sought punitive measures against Ayyub. Simultaneously, {{in a separate}} incident, Shirkuh killed a close confidant of Bihruz on charges that he had sexually assaulted a woman in Tikrit. The Abbasid court issued arrest warrants for both Ayyub and Shirkuh, but before the brothers could be arrested, they departed Tikrit for Mosul in 1138. When they arrived in Mosul, Zangi <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> all the facilities they needed and he recruited the two brothers into his service. Ayyub was made commander of Ba'albek and Shirkuh entered the service of Zangi's son, Nur ad-Din. According to historian Abdul Ali, it was under the care and patronage of Zangi that the Ayyubid family rose to prominence.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{blending}} of Western and Malagasy musical elements was occurring simultaneously {{among a number}} of northwestern bands and musicians of Jaojoby's generation. Although no single individual can be credited with creating the modern salegy genre, Jaojoby ranks among the earliest originators of the nascent musical style. A desire for greater freedom to write songs and further develop the syncretic modern salegy style led Jaojoby to leave Los Matadores in 1975 for The Players, another regional band that was less well-established but more willing to take risks. The band was managed by a Chinese shopkeeper who <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> a sound system and generator. The band toured northwestern Madagascar {{for the next four years}} with increasing success, recording two 45rpm singles and performing in Mahajanga, Diego-Suarez, and other towns and villages throughout the region before disbanding in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Following his father's death, Géza {{offered to}} accept Solomon's rule if he {{received}} his father's former duchy. This offer was refused, which forced him and his two brothersLadislaus and Lampertto leave Hungary for Poland. King Bolesław II of Poland <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> reinforcements and they returned after the German troops withdrewn from Hungary. The brothers wanted to avoid a new civil war and made an agreement with King Solomon. According to the treaty, which was signed in Győr on 20 January 1064, Géza and his brothers accepted Solomon's rule and the king granted them their father's duchy. The king and his cousins celebrated Easter together in the cathedral of Pécs, where Duke Géza ceremoniously put a crown on Solomon's head.|$|E
5|$|Quantrill's Raiders had {{a support}} network in Missouri, that <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> {{numerous}} hiding places. Anderson's sisters aided the guerrillas by gathering information inside Union territory. In August 1863, however, Union General Thomas Ewing, Jr., attempted {{to thwart the}} guerrillas by arresting their female relatives, and Anderson's sisters were confined in a three-story building on Grand Avenue in Kansas City {{with a number of}} other girls. While they were confined, the building collapsed, killing one of Anderson's sisters. In the aftermath, rumors that the building had been intentionally sabotaged by Union soldiers spread quickly; Anderson was convinced that it had been a deliberate act. Biographer Larry Wood wrote that Anderson's motivation shifted {{after the death of his}} sister, arguing that killing then became his focus—and an enjoyable act. Castel and Goodrich maintain that killing became more than a means to an end at that point for Anderson: it became an end in itself.|$|E
5|$|This early era was {{followed}} by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century. Land was divided into regions designed for both the immediate needs of the populace and the long-term welfare of the environment. These ahupuaa generally {{took the form of}} long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast. Mauna Kea's summit was encompassed in the ahupuaa of Kaohe, with part of its eastern slope reaching into the nearby Humuula. Principal sources of nutrition for Hawaiians living on the slopes of the volcano came from the māmane–naio forest of its upper slopes, which <b>provided</b> <b>them</b> <b>with</b> vegetation and bird life. Bird species hunted included the uau (Pterodroma sandwichensis), nēnē (Branta sandvicensis), and palila (Loxioides bailleui). The lower koa–ōhia forest gave the natives wood for canoes and ornate bird feathers for decoration.|$|E
