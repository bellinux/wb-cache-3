40|$|Background and aims: Studies {{have shown}} that a HOXB 13 :IL 17 BR {{expression}} ratio index predicts clinical outcome in ER-positive, lymph node-negative breast cancer patients that treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. All of these experiments were conducted with qReal Time RT-PCR using TaqMan probes. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the ratio using SYBR Green I qReal Time RT-PCR. Methods: In this case- control study, expression levels of HOXB 13 :IL 17 BR was measured in 40 paired formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded primary breast tumor specimens. After extracting RNA from the tissues, cDNA synthesis and amplification with the polymerase chain reaction to obtain the optimum annealing temperature, the expression levels was measured by SYBR Green I qReal Time RT-PCR. To determine and normalize the expression levels, BestKeeper software was used to obtain the BestKeeper Index using the geometric mean of expression levels of housekeeping genes. Comparison of mean expression of genes between tumoral and non-tumoral tissues was performed by t-test and association between <b>patient</b> <b>grouping</b> (high/low risk) and time for disease free survival was assessed by Fisher`s Exact test. Results: HOXB 13 :IL 17 BR expression value did not show significant difference between tumoral and non-tumoral tissues. The results showed that there was a direct and significant association between <b>patient</b> <b>grouping</b> (based on HOXB 13 :IL 17 BR ratio) and disease free survival status. Conclusion: Results in the current study showed that in spite of using SYBR Green dye (instead of TaqMan probes), there is still a significant correlation between HOXB 13 :IL 17 BR ratio and disease free survival status. ...|$|E

Data from 2409 COPD patients of French/Belgian COPD cohorts were analysed using cluster analysis {{resulting in the}} identification of subgroups, for which clinical relevance was determined by comparing 3 -year all-cause mortality. Classification and regression trees (CARTs) were used to develop an algorithm for allocating patients to these subgroups. This algorithm was tested in 3651 patients from the COPD Cohorts Collaborative International Assessment (3 CIA) initiative. Cluster analysis identified five subgroups of COPD patients with different clinical characteristics (especially regarding severity of respiratory disease and the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities and diabetes).

40|$|The {{methylation}} {{status of}} O- 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) {{is associated with}} the prognosis in gliomas and in other cancers. Recent studies showed that rs 16906252, an SNP in the MGMT promoter, is associated with promoter methylation and is a predictor of the overall survival time (OST) and the response to temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. However, these findings haven't been systematically investigated in the Han-Chinese population. We analyzed the relevance between rs 16906252 polymorphisms, the MGMT methylation status, and the OST in 72 Han-Chinese gliomas patients. The MGMT promoter methylation was measured by bisulfite conversion followed by pyro-sequencing, while rs 16906252 was measured by restriction endonuclease digestion. Contrary to the previous findings, we found no association between rs 16906252 genotypes and promoter methylation on MGMT. The lower-grade glioma (LGGs) patients carrying the C allele with rs 16906252 showed a surprisingly better OST (P = 0. 04).

40|$|The {{practice}} of medicine is predicated on discovering commonalities or distinguishing characteristics among patients to inform corresponding treatment. Given a <b>patient</b> <b>grouping</b> (hereafter {{referred to as a}} p henotype), clinicians can implement a treatment pathway accounting for the underlying cause of disease in that phenotype. Traditionally, phenotypes have been discovered by intuition, experience in practice, and advancements in basic science, but these approaches are often heuristic, labor intensive, and can take decades to produce actionable knowledge. Although our understanding of disease has progressed substantially in the past century, there are still important domains in which our phenotypes are murky, such as in behavioral health or in hospital settings. To accelerate phenotype discovery, researchers have used machine learning to find patterns in electronic health records, but have often been thwarted by missing data, sparsity, and data heterogeneity. In this study, we use a flexible framework called Generalized Low Rank Modeling (GLRM) to overcome these barriers and discover phenotypes in two sources of patient data. First, we analyze data from the 2010 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample (NIS), which contains upwards of 8 million hospitalization records consisting of administrative codes and demographic information.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of bone metastasis on survival and quality of life (QoL) in men with hormone-naive prostate cancer. Materials and methods: The study included 900 patients from a randomized trial (No. 5) by the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group, comparing parenteral oestrogen with total androgen blockade. Extent of bone metastasis was categorized according to a modified Soloway score: score 1, n= 319; score 2, n = 483; and score 3, n = 98 patients. The primary outcome measurements were mean differences in QoL and overall survival. Results: QoL rating scales showed a decrease with increasing extent of bone metastasis (p amp;lt; 0. 001). The mean global health status decreased from 64. 4 to 50. 5 for Soloway score 1 and 3, respectively. Following adjustment for performance status, analgesic consumption, grade of malignancy, alkaline phosphatase, prostate-specific antigen, haemoglobin and global health status, Soloway score 2 and 3 had a 47 % [hazard ratio (HR) 1. 47, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 21 - 1. 80] and 78 % (HR 1. 78 95 %, CI 1. 32 - 2. 42) increased mortality, respectively, compared to Soloway score 1.

40|$|Length of stay (LOS) {{is often}} used as a proxy measure of a patient’ {{resource}} consumption because of the practical difficulties of directly measuring resource consumption and the easiness of calculating LOS. Grouping patient spells according to their LOS {{has proved to be}} a challenge in health care applications due to the inherent variability in the LOS distribution. Sound methods for LOS-based <b>patient</b> <b>grouping</b> should certainly lead to a better planning of bed allocation, and patient admission and discharge. Grouping patient spells according to their LOS in a computational efficient manner is still a research issue that has not been fully addressed. For instance, grouping patient spells according to LOS intervals (e. g. 0 - 3 days, 4 - 9 days, 10 - 21 days etc.), has previously been defined by non-algorithmic approaches using clinical judgement, visual inspection of the LOS distribution or according to the perceived casemix. The aim of this paper is to present a novel methodology of grouping patients according to their length of stay based on fitting Gaussian mixture models to LOS observations. This method was developed as part of an innovative prediction tool that helps identify groups of patients exhibiting similar resource consumption levels as these are approximated by patient LOS. As part of evaluating the approach, we also compare it to two alternative clustering approaches, K-means and the two-step algorithm. Computational results show the superiority of this method compared to alternative clustering approaches in terms of its ability to extract clinically meaningful patient groups as applied to a skewed LOS dataset...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Staging {{of cancer}} {{is based on}} the TNM system. This {{valuable}} system takes only tumor-related parameters into account, but in the era of refined surgery and preoperative therapy treatment-related factors are of equal importance. By using rectal cancer as a model we explored the hypothesis that a combination of tumor- and treatment-related parameters will result in improved prognostication. METHODS: Standardized clinicopathologic and histologic factors considered predictive for survival were studied in eligible patients treated in a trial for rectal cancer (n = 1324). These factors were analyzed in relation to survival using log-rank tests, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox regression both individually and in combination, the latter including TNM staging. A second data set from an independent trial (n = 316) was used for data validation. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis identified nodal status (P =. 001) and circumferential margin (P =. 001) involvement as the most important prognostic factors for survival. The combination of these factors formed an improved staging system (node status and circumferential margin [NCRM]) compared with the present TNM staging with respect to 5 -year cancer-specific survival. The results were confirmed in our independent patient population. CONCLUSIONS: NCRM staging of rectal cancer results in a broad range of survival rates and favorable <b>patient</b> <b>grouping.</b> Our data give strong evidence that a staging system combing tumor- and treatment-related factors provides better prognostic information than the classic TNM system, which is based solely on tumor-related factors.

40|$|PURPOSE: Risk {{assessment}} for locoregional disease recurrence {{would be highly}} valuable in preoperative treatment planning for patients undergoing primary rectal tumor resection. Epigenetic aberrations such as DNA methylation {{have been shown to}} be significant prognostic biomarkers of disease outcome. In this study, we evaluated the significance of a quantitative epigenetic multimarker panel analysis of primary tumors to predict local recurrence in rectal cancer patients from a retrospective multicenter clinical trial. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary tumors were studied from patients enrolled in the trial who underwent total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer (n= 325). Methylation levels of seven methylated-in-tumor (MINT) loci were assessed by absolute quantitative assessment of methylated alleles. Unsupervised random forest clustering of quantitative MINT methylation data was used to show subclassification into groups with matching methylation profiles. RESULTS: Variable importance parameters [Gini-Index (GI) ] of the clustering algorithm indicated MINT 3 and MINT 17 (GI, 20. 2 and 20. 7, respectively) to be informative for <b>patient</b> <b>grouping</b> compared with the other MINT loci (highest GI, 12. 2). When using this two-biomarker panel, four different patient clusters were identified. One cluster containing 73 % (184 of 251) of the patients was at significantly increased risk of local recurrence (hazard ratio, 10. 23; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 38 - 75. 91) in multivariate analysis, corrected for standard prognostic factors of rectal cancer. This group showed a significantly higher local recurrence probability than patients receiving preoperative radiation (P< 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Quantitative epigenetic subclassification of rectal cancers has clinical utility in distinguishing tumors with increased risk for local recurrence and may help tailor treatment regimens for locoregional control...|$|E

Charcoal/sorbitol slurry (CSS) administration {{is one of}} these methods with greatdebates around it which needs to be investigated more. Methods: In this clinical trial, 105 cases of benzodiazepine toxicity with at least 3 symptoms and no contraindication for sorbitol prescription were divided into 3 groups. <b>Patient</b> <b>grouping</b> was based on the sorbitol manufacturing factory. Sorbitol wasprescribed for the patients, with one kind of sorbitol for the patients of each group. Themeasured variable was the time passed up to the presence of charcoal-mixed stool andthe gathered data were analyzed by ANOVA test using SPSS software. Results: The average age was 25. 8 ± 8. 4 in females and 24 ± 8. 5 years for males(P= 0. 641). The average follow up time was 8. 3 ± 3. 1 hours for females and 8. 1 ± 2. 7 hours for males (P= 0. 30).

Accordingly, {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine whether SM alters the amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP) or the short-latency stretch reflex of the erector spinae muscles, and whether these physiologic responses depend on whether SM causes an audible joint sound. Methods We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to elicit MEPs and electromechanical tapping to elicit short-latency stretch reflexes in 10 patients with chronic LBP and 10 asymptomatic controls. Neurophysiologic outcomes were measured before and after SM. Changes in MEP and stretch reflex amplitude were examined based on <b>patient</b> <b>grouping</b> (LBP vs. controls), and whether SM caused an audible joint sound. Results SM did not alter the erector spinae MEP amplitude in patients with LBP (0. 80 ± 0. 33 vs. 0. 80 ± 0. 30 μV) or in asymptomatic controls (0. 56 ± 0. 09 vs. 0. 57 ± 0. 06 μV). Similarly, SM did not alter the erector spinae stretch reflex amplitude in patients with LBP (0. 66 ± 0. 12 vs. 0. 66 ± 0. 15 μV) or in asymptomatic controls (0. 60 ± 0. 09 vs. 0. 55 ± 0. 08 μV). Interestingly, study participants exhibiting an audible response exhibited a 20 % decrease in the stretch reflex (p Conclusions These findings suggest that a single SM treatment does not systematically alter corticospinal or stretch reflex excitability of the erector spinae muscles (when assessed ~ 10 -minutes following SM); however, they do indicate that the stretch reflex is attenuated when SM causes an audible response. This finding provides insight into the mechanisms of SM, and suggests that SM that produces an audible response may mechanistically act to decrease the sensitivity of the muscle spindles and/or the various segmental sites of the Ia reflex pathway. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{controversy}} surrounding the non-uniqueness of predictive gene lists (PGL) of small selected subsets of genes from very large potential candidates as available in DNA microarray experiments is now widely acknowledged 1. Many {{of these studies}} have focused on constructing discriminative semi-parametric models and as such are also subject to the issue of random correlations of sparse model selection in high dimensional spaces. In this work we outline a different approach based around an unsupervised patient-specific nonlinear topographic projection in predictive gene lists. Methods We construct nonlinear topographic projection maps based on inter-patient gene-list relative dissimilarities. The Neuroscale, the Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(SNE) and the Locally Linear Embedding(LLE) techniques have been used to construct two-dimensional projective visualisation plots of 70 dimensional PGLs per patient, classifiers are also constructed to identify the prognosis indicator of each patient using the resulting projections from those visualisation techniques and investigate whether a-posteriori two prognosis groups are separable on the evidence of the gene lists. A literature-proposed predictive gene list for breast cancer is benchmarked against a separate gene list using the above methods. Generalisation ability is investigated by using the mapping capability of Neuroscale to visualise the follow-up study, but based on the projections derived from the original dataset. Results The results indicate that small subsets of patient-specific PGLs have insufficient prognostic dissimilarity to permit a distinction between two prognosis patients. Uncertainty and diversity across multiple gene expressions prevents unambiguous or even confident <b>patient</b> <b>grouping.</b> Comparative projections across different PGLs provide similar results. Conclusion The random correlation effect to an arbitrary outcome induced by small subset selection from very high dimensional interrelated gene expression profiles leads to an outcome with associated uncertainty. This continuum and uncertainty precludes any attempts at constructing discriminative classifiers. However a patient's gene expression profile could possibly be used in treatment planning, based on knowledge of other patients' responses. We conclude that many of the patients involved in such medical studies are intrinsically unclassifiable on the basis of provided PGL evidence. This additional category of 'unclassifiable' should be accommodated within medical decision support systems if serious errors and unnecessary adjuvant therapy are to be avoided. </p...|$|E

Likewise, carotid artery stiffness index of group I patients (mean (SD) 5. 07 (1. 11)) was significantly greater than that of group II (4. 27 (0. 83), p = 0. 002), and of group III patients (4. 24 (0. 86), p = 0. 001). For the entire cohort, the carotid artery stiffness index correlated positively with log serum hs-CRP concentration (r = 0. 24, p = 0. 013). In multiple linear regression analysis, age (standardised β = 0. 22, p = 0. 02), systolic blood pressure (standardised β = 0. 28, p = 0. 01), log serum hs-CRP concentration (standardised β = 0. 21, p = 0. 017), and <b>patient</b> <b>grouping</b> (standardised β = - 0. 36, p < 0. 001) were all independently associated with the carotid artery stiffness index. Conclusions: These findings support the possibility of ongoing low grade inflammation late after the acute phase of Kawasaki disease in patients with coronary aneurysms. Furthermore, this low grade inflammation may have a role in increasing systemic arterial stiffness. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{differentiate}} between transmural perioperative myocardial infarction (T-PMI) and subendocardial perioperative myocardial injury (S-PMI) as a complication of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Seventy-three patients undergoing CABG were followed post operatively by measuring troponin T, CK-MB isoenzyme mass concentration (CK-MB mass), creatine kinase MB isoenzyme activity (CK-MB activity), creatine kinase (CK), a hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBD), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at five sampling times. Lacking a proper definition of the gold standard for the diagnosis of perioperative myocardial infarction, a statistical procedure was used. Supported by the cluster analysis method of Ward, patients were assigned to a <b>patient</b> <b>group</b> with a perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) or a <b>patient</b> <b>group</b> without a PMI (non-PMI) as a confirmation of interpretation of the biochemical results. Using the results of electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography, the PMI <b>patient</b> <b>group</b> was split into a T-PMI <b>patient</b> <b>group</b> and a S-PMI <b>patient</b> <b>group.</b> With discriminant analysis, two canonic discriminant functions were drawn up to differentiate between patients suffering from a T-PMI or S-PMI and non-PMI patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the preferences of}} health care professional <b>groups</b> and <b>patient</b> <b>groups</b> with respect to efficacy, adverse events, and administration method for targeted agents of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. MethodsA total of 485 respondents including cancer patients and health care professionals (medical oncologists, nurses, and pharmacists) were surveyed by using a discrete choice experiment in South Korea. Through a literature review and expert consultation, six attributes—progression-free survival, four adverse events (bone marrow suppression, hand-foot skin reaction, gastrointestinal perforation, and bleeding), and administration—were selected. This study employed the conditional logit regression model. ResultsThe six attributes are statistically significant for the <b>patient</b> <b>group</b> and health care professional group. The two groups, however, present differences in progression-free survival, hand-foot skin reaction, gastrointestinal perforation, and administration. The relative importance of adverse events is greater for the <b>patient</b> <b>group,</b> while that of efficacy and administration is greater for the health professional group. For doctors, {{the relative importance of}} efficacy is as high as 31 %, compared with 7 % for the <b>patient</b> <b>group.</b> If progression-free survival is prolonged by 1 month, the acceptable level of bone marrow suppression is 1. 3 % for the <b>patient</b> <b>group</b> and 9. 6 % for doctors and that of hand-foot skin reaction is 1. 0 % and 11. 8 %, respectively, for the <b>patient</b> <b>group</b> and doctors. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates substantial differences in the preference for a targeted drug between the <b>patient</b> <b>group</b> and the health care professional group. Doctors prefer effective and orally administered drugs while patients show more reluctant attitudes about adverse events than do health care professionals...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{controversy}} surrounding the non-uniqueness of predictive gene lists (PGL) of small selected subsets of genes from very large potential candidates as available in DNA microarray experiments is now widely acknowledged 1. Many {{of these studies}} have focused on constructing discriminative semi-parametric models and as such are also subject to the issue of random correlations of sparse model selection in high dimensional spaces. In this work we outline a different approach based around an unsupervised patient-specific nonlinear topographic projection in predictive gene lists. Methods: We construct nonlinear topographic projection maps based on inter-patient gene-list relative dissimilarities. The Neuroscale, the Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(SNE) and the Locally Linear Embedding(LLE) techniques have been used to construct two-dimensional projective visualisation plots of 70 dimensional PGLs per patient, classifiers are also constructed to identify the prognosis indicator of each patient using the resulting projections from those visualisation techniques and investigate whether a-posteriori two prognosis groups are separable on the evidence of the gene lists. A literature-proposed predictive gene list for breast cancer is benchmarked against a separate gene list using the above methods. Generalisation ability is investigated by using the mapping capability of Neuroscale to visualise the follow-up study, but based on the projections derived from the original dataset. Results: The results indicate that small subsets of patient-specific PGLs have insufficient prognostic dissimilarity to permit a distinction between two prognosis patients. Uncertainty and diversity across multiple gene expressions prevents unambiguous or even confident <b>patient</b> <b>grouping.</b> Comparative projections across different PGLs provide similar results. Conclusion: The random correlation effect to an arbitrary outcome induced by small subset selection from very high dimensional interrelated gene expression profiles leads to an outcome with associated uncertainty. This continuum and uncertainty precludes any attempts at constructing discriminative classifiers. However a patient's gene expression profile could possibly be used in treatment planning, based on knowledge of other patients' responses. We conclude that many of the patients involved in such medical studies are intrinsically unclassifiable on the basis of provided PGL evidence. This additional category of 'unclassifiable' should be accommodated within medical decision support systems if serious errors and unnecessary adjuvant therapy are to be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Prostate cancer (PCa) is {{the most}} common cancer among men in Sweden. The {{clinical}} course varies considerably, which makes it difficult to predict the prognosis in the individual case. In order to explore the early as well as the late course of the disease, large study groups and population-based cohorts are necessary. Aims To explore factors that influence the long-term outcome of men with low-risk tumours in a population-based register, to predict the long-term course, and to assess the mortality rate for men with prostate cancer (Paper I) To analyse long-term outcome and to investigate factors associated with long-term survival in patients with metastases to the skeleton (Paper II) To analyse early androgen deprivation treatment (ADT) failure and to define clinical predictors associated with short survival due to early ADT failure in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases (Paper III) To analyse the prognostic significance of the extent of bone metastases in relation to other pretreatment variables in prostate cancer patients, and to explore the impact of bone metastases on quality-of-life (Paper IV) Material and methods The study groups were assembled from The South East Region Prostate Cancer Register (SERPCR), and The Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group (SPCG) Trial No. 5. In the first study, prognostic factors and long-term disease-specific mortality rates of low-risk prostate cancer patients from the early PSA era were analysed. In the second study, patient-related factors, quality-of-life (QoL) and long-term survival in 915 PCa patients with bone metastases (M 1 b) under ADT, were analysed. In Study III factors predicting primary failure to respond to ADT were identified. Study IV explored the impact of the extent of bone metastases on survival and QoL for these men. Result and conclusions The long-term disease-specific mortality of low-risk localised PCa is low, but the annual mortality rate gradually increases. This indicates that some tumours slowly develop into lethal cancer, particularly in men 70 years or older and with a PSA level ≥ 4 μg/L. From the SPCG Trial No. 5, a subgroup of patients with M 1 b disease and favourable set of predictive factors survived more than 10 years under ADT with an acceptable QoL. Independent predictors of long-term survival were identified as performance status (PS) < 2, limited extent of bone metastases, and a PSA level < 231 μg/L at the time of enrolment in the trial. However, four independent clinical predictors of early ADT failure could be defined. Men exhibiting these features should be considered for an alternative treatment. <b>Patient</b> <b>grouping</b> based on three categories of extent of bone metastases related to PS, haemoglobin, and QoL at presentation, as independent predictors of mortality, may provide improved accuracy of prognosis...|$|E
