Despite <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often {{are not willing to}} pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say {{they would be willing to}} pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. Once enough consumers begin purchasing fair trade, companies are more likely to carry fair trade products. Safeway Inc. began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.|$|E

25|$|The last {{factor of}} optimistic bias {{is that of}} {{underlying}} affect and affect experience. Research has found that people show less optimistic bias when experiencing a negative mood, and more optimistic bias when in a positive mood. Sad moods reflect greater memories of negative events, which lead to more negative judgments, while positive moods promote happy memories and more positive feelings. This suggests that overall negative moods, including depression, result in increased personal risk estimates but less optimistic bias overall. Anxiety also leads to less optimistic bias, continuing to suggest that overall positive experiences and <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> lead to more optimistic bias in events.|$|E

She concludes that the educational setting (immersion schools, for example) and the use of the language outside the classroom were the best predictors for L2-Irish acquisition. Eighteen months later, Murtagh finds that the majority of groups 1 and 2 believe their Irish ability has attrited, the immersion group less so. The results from the tests, however, do not show any overall attrition. Time as a factor did not exert any overall significant change on the sample's proficiency in Irish (Murtagh, 2003:159).|$|E

25|$|In {{literature}} {{several factors}} are named for explaining why language competence is decreasing. Many researchers, however, regard {{the level of}} competence of the learner as essential for attrition. It is said that the higher the level of competence, the less attrition will occur. Thus, {{a reference to the}} theory of the critical threshold can be drawn. Similar to this theory it is claimed, that according to conducted studies, the higher the level of competence of the learner {{at the end of the}} incubation period, the fewer will be lost. Therefore duration, success and intensity of the language instruction or language input in general is vitally important. Weltens (1987) divides the factors influencing language attrition into three categories: characteristics of the acquisition process (method of instruction, length of exposure, proficiency before attrition, relationship between L1 and the FL), characteristics of the attrition period ('post exposure' and length of the attrition period), and learner characteristics. The second category are sociopsychological factors, as the attitude towards the target language and culture and aligned with the motivation for acquiring the language. Further, factors, which are settled in the language environment, should be considered as well, e.g. the status and prestige of the language are meaningful, too. Another frequent occurring factor is age. A variable that seems to be quite important, especially observing language attrition in children. Even though children are regarded as the better foreign language learner, their cognitive development is less progressed compared to adults. Further, usually they haven't learned to write or read in any language, and usually particularly not in the second language at all. Therefore their literacy skill in the L2 is very limited if not even there yet. Cohen (1989) conducted a study observing young children. He found out, that the attrition in an 8-year-old boy was stronger than the one in his 12-year-old sister. Tomiyama, suggested on the basis of her findings, that these children might not lose their knowledge of the L2 completely, moreover the access to such information is inaccessible and may vanish with time passing by. At the beginning of the 80s another, so far unnoticed factor, was introduced into the research field. Socioaffective factors as attitude, orientation and motivation are now accounted. On account of that, he established a socio-educational model of language acquisition. Thereby motivation and attitude influence the workload of the individual to keep their language competence. Further, individuals, who have <b>positive</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards the target language, seek possibilities and opportunities during the incubation period to retain their language competence (Gardner 1987: 521). However, the factor motivation is hardly considered examining language attrition. Especially during the last 10–15 years it became more and more acknowledged in the field of language acquisition rather than attrition. Only Gardner considered motivation as a possible factor influencing attrition. Even until today it is hardly recognised as an influencing factor and therefore exist only a few studies about motivation and its effects.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} how attitudes and subjective norms {{could be used}} to predict participation intention of adults in continuing education. In this research, attitudes comprised the two variables of <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> and negative attitude and subjective norms included normative belief and motivation to comply. Structural equation modeling using a maximum likelihood estimator was used to test the data collected from 752 adult respondents in Hong Kong, China. The results indicated that the relationships between <b>positive</b> <b>attitude,</b> negative attitude, normative belief and participation intention were significant. The relationship between motivation to comply and participation intention was found insignificant. However the strong relationship between motivation to comply and <b>positive</b> <b>attitude</b> revealed the indirect influence of motivation to comply on participation intention through <b>positive</b> <b>attitude.</b> The result also disclosed the phenomenon that normative belief was a better predictor of participation intention in continuing education than <b>positive</b> and negative <b>attitudes</b> in this context. The Theory of Reasoned Action (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) was used as the basis of reference in developing the conceptual framework of this study. The revised attitudes towards continuing education scales (Blunt, 2002) were shown to have validity in terms of the direct association with the various attitudes of adults towards continuing education. It was concluded that <b>positive</b> <b>attitude,</b> negative attitude, normative belief and motivation to comply with perceived social influence provided meaningful indicators of the respondents in the sample as well as reliable predictive variables to participation intention in continuing education. </p...|$|R
