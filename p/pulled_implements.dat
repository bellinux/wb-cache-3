5|$|Bumblebee {{species are}} declining in Europe, North America, and Asia {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to <b>pull</b> <b>implements</b> and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little artificial fertiliser was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus genus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species Bombus hortorum in particular {{has been found to be}} impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{draught control}} system, as fitted to modern tractors, {{consists of a}} negative feed back control system that adjusts the working depth of mounted or semi mounted soil engaging implements {{in an attempt to}} regulate the draught requirements of the implement. The system has become important in agricultural production because it increases the efficiency of tractor operations in two ways. Firstly, by controlling the draught requirements of an implement the draught control system allows tractor engine efficiency to be optimised. Secondly, by transferring some of the weight of the implement onto the rear wheels of the tractor, wheel slip is reduced and controlled. This latter function, more than any other, was responsible for the major change in the design concept of tractors, permitting smaller, lighter tractors to do the same work as their heavier predecessors, <b>pulling</b> trailed <b>implements.</b> The control system has lead to the ability of relatively light weight tractors being able to maintain a high work rate (in terms of area cultivated in a given time) with acceptable working depth fluctuations, and without undue energy loss through wheel slip...|$|R

50|$|Porosity {{of surface}} soil {{typically}} decreases as particle size increases. This {{is due to}} soil aggregate formation in finer textured surface soils when subject to soil biological processes. Aggregation involves particulate adhesion and higher resistance to compaction. Typical bulk density of sandy soil is between 1.5 and 1.7 g/cm3. This calculates to a porosity between 0.43 and 0.36. Typical bulk density of clay soil is between 1.1 and 1.3 g/cm3. This calculates to a porosity between 0.58 and 0.51. This seems counterintuitive because clay soils are termed heavy, implying lower porosity.

Due to this, and for comparability reasons, we proposed this standardised flow metric as a KPI. The definition for the example of an inbound transportation flow metric is provided in the appendix.

5000|$|Another {{characteristic}} to African American ghettos {{and spatial}} separation is the {{dependence on the}} state, and lack of communal autonomy; Sharon Zukin refers to Brownsville, Brooklyn, as an example. This relationship between racial ghettos and the state is demonstrated through various push and <b>pull</b> features, <b>implemented</b> through government subsidized investments, which certainly assisted the movement of white Americans into the suburbs after World War II. Since the 1960s, after the deconstitution of the inner cities, African American ghettos have attempted to reorganize or reconstitute; in effect, they are increasingly regarded as public- and state-dependent communities. Brownsville, for instance, initiated the constitution of community-established public housing, anti-poverty organizations, and social service facilities - all, in their own way, depend on state resources. However, certain dependence contradicts society's desires to be autonomous actors in the market. Moreover, Zukin implies, [...] "the less 'autonomous' the community - in its dependence on public schools, public housing and various subsidy programs - the greater the inequity between their organizations and the state, and the less willing residents are to organize." [...] This should not, on the other hand, undermine local development corporations or social service agencies helping these neighborhoods. The lack of autonomy and growing dependence on the state, especially in a neoliberal economy, remains a key indicator to the production {{as well as the}} prevalence of African American ghettos, particularly {{due to the lack of}} opportunities to compete in the global market.|$|R

40|$|Two {{field studies}} {{examining}} direct ecological weed control practices {{were conducted in}} Lexington, Kentucky. The first evaluated weed control efficacy and influence on yields of several mulches in two organically-managed bell pepper (Capsicum annum) production systems for two years. Peppers were planted in double rows in flat, bare ground or on black polyethylene-covered raised beds with drip irrigation, and four mulches (straw, compost, wood chips, and undersown white dutch clover (Trifolium repens L.) “living mulch”) were applied to the two production systems. In both years, polyethylene-covered raised beds produced higher yields than the flat, bare ground system. In the second year, the polyethylene-covered bed system coupled with mulching in-between beds with compost or wood chips after cultivation provided excellent weed control and yields. The second field study evaluated the efficacy of soil solarization and shallow cultivation on the invasive and noxious weed johnsongrass over two years (Sorghum halapense).

40|$|A low {{inventory}} {{with high}} availability {{is the primary}} objective for make-to-stock production plants. Thus, production plants must choose between two approaches, a push production system or a pull production system. Despite {{the simplicity of the}} pull system, and numerous reports of successful implementation, the push system remains prevalent. Interviews with local managers reveal two obstacles to <b>implementing</b> <b>pull</b> systems: (1) lack of a precise definition for pull systems, and a general ignorance among managers regarding the concept of pull systems. As a result, some managers may believe they are running a pull system when they are actually using a push system; (2) lack of confidence in the ability of a pull system to handle significant demand variability.

The results support our belief that most participating managers still use a push system, and demonstrate that a pull system is superior.

40|$|Citation: Davis, Guy R. Draft problems. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1905. Introduction: Every modern {{agriculturist}} {{of today}} {{should have a}} fairly accurate knowledge of the draft required for <b>pulling</b> the different <b>implements</b> on the farm under varying conditions. That this question should be seriously considered by all farmers can easily be proven by {{a large number of}} experiments which show that some machines require more draft power than others for the accomplishment of the same kind and the same amount of work. Before giving any data obtained by the writer or by others, it may be well to give a description of the instrument, which is called the dynamometer, by means of which the draft is determined, and also give some general facts about the subject. The dynamometer is an instrument for measuring the force or weight required to pull a load on a wagon or draw a machine as it works in the field. The dynamometer is made a link in the draught chain and thus subjected to the tension which it is desired to ascertain. The kind of instrument which is used mostly today, especially where the draft is variable as with all agricultural implements, is a self -recording dynamometer. According to the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station report the earliest notice that we have that horses were used in field labor is from the figure on a piece of tapestry woven at Bayonne in the time of William the Conqueror, 1066 A. D. On this tapestry was a figure of a man driving a horse attached to a harrow. Up to within the last century or two it has been the practice in Briton to hitch horses to the plow or harrow by means of withes tied to the tails of the animals. McDonald in his Survey of the Hebrides in 1808, says, "the common practice was to fasten horses and colts by the tail to the harrow," although in 1634 a law was passed against this custom. Another law of the early Britons was "that no L one should guide a plow until he could make one and that the driver should make the traces by which the plow was drawn of withes or twisted willows. ...|$|R
40|$|Stability {{criteria}} of front-mounted lateral movable three-point hitches {{have been known}} for several years. The steering ability of the tractor will be improved by this kind of implement hitch, compared with an implement hitch unable to move sideways. This is applicable particularly when a soil-working implement is used. There are several other advantages with front-mounted lateral movable three-point hitches. In spite of all advantages, this kind of implement hitch is not used in practice. This work shows that the lateral motion of front-mounted directional implements mostly follows the simplified theory proposed by Jönsson (1983). Also the lateral motion of front- mounted non-directional implements follows the simplified theory, provided that the area within which the non-directional hitch-point is moving can be approximated by a point. Another necessary requirement for the simplified {{theory is that the}} friction in the links can be neglected. According to the simplified theory, directional implements are moving towards the directional hitch-point and non-directional implements are moving towards the non-directional hitch-point. The lateral disturbances, are exponentially reduced according to the equation (Jönsson, 1983) : Ls = Ls 0 ∙e^-(x/Lh) where Ls side disturbance X travelled distance Lh hitch length The simplified theory assumes that the areas within which the hitch points are moving, when implements are moving laterally, can be approximated by points. This assumption implies that the hitch length can be approximated as constant. This approximation was shown to be fulfilled when the implement was mounted on a rear-mounted three-point hitch. In this case, the force in the upper link was relatively small. This was shown by a study of two different <b>pulled</b> non-directional <b>implements.</b> One implement with a draught force in the upper link and one with a compressive force in the upper link. The return of the implement from the lateral disturbance was almost similar for both implements. Thus, small variations in the upper link force were shown to have only minor influence on the lateral motion of the implement. To get front-mounted three-point linkages laterally stable and self-centring a large draught force in the upper link is required. This complicates the application of the simplified theory to front-mounted laterally movable three-point hitches, because the simplified theory has so far neglected the influence of the force in the upper link. The influence of different hitch geometry variables on the areas, within which the hitch points move when the implement moves laterally, has been studied in this work. For laterally stable implement-hitch combinations it is normally possible to approximate the area, within which the directional hitch point moves, by a point. The area, within which the non-directional point moves, is often larger. However, some combinations of hitch variables made it possible to reduce this area, within which the non-directional hitch-point moves, so much that also this area could be approximated by a point. Variable changes that contribute to reduce this area are: 1 Reducing the convergence of the lower links or moving forward the convergence point of the lower links 2 Reducing the length of the upper link 3 Increasing the relation between the upper link draught force and the soil force 4 Increasing the length of the lower links The influence on the lateral motion of the implements from these variables was studied partly by simulating the lateral motion of different implements and partly by measuring the lateral motion of different test hitch-implement combinations. In the simulations, the motion of the implement was always directed towards the momentary hitch point. The motion of the implements was then compared with the lateral motion of the implements according to the simplified theory. As long as the hitch points were moving within a small area, the lateral motion of the implement followed the simplified theory...|$|R
40|$|The present PhD thesis {{explored}} nonlinear wave {{mixing with}} the strong evanescent field of nanofibers. The {{focus has been on}} the effect of stimulated Raman scattering which is activated by the interaction between such a strong evanescent field and the nonlinear liquid surrounding the nanofiber. In order to observe the stimulated Raman scattering, we investigated the nonlinear modeling to determine the needed characteristics of the nanofibers. The modal Raman gain was calculated to determine the optimal radius of nanofibers for each possible liquid. Considering the critical power and the damage threshold of our nanofibers, we found the minimum required interaction length. The condition of adiabacity of the tapers was also described. These specifications of nanofibers guide us towards the design of a proper pulling system. Several pulling systems and techniques are investigated for the fabrication of our specific nanofibers. We now are able to fabricate low loss uniform nanofibers of up to 10 cm long, a diameter down to 200 nm, with two identical low loss tapers by using our own designed translation stage <b>pulling</b> platform and <b>implemented</b> with the “variable heat brush” technique. With the achieved nanofibers, the Raman effect induced in the evanescent field was observed in both pure (ethanol) and binary mixture (toluene in ethanol) liquids. These first measurements are in good agreement with our simulation even without any fitting parameters in the modeling. Cette thèse porte sur les mélanges d’onde non linéaires qui peuvent avoir lieu dans le champ évanescent de nanofibres de silice. Nous nous sommes plus particulièrement intéressés à la diffusion Raman stimulée qui est obtenue par l’interaction du champ évanescent très intense et un liquide non linéaire dans lequel baigne la nanofibre. Afin de mettre en évidence la diffusion Raman stimulée« évanescente », nous avons développé un modèle de simulation non linéaire dont le but est de déterminer les caractéristiques des nanofibres à réaliser. Le gain Raman modal est calculé afin de trouver le rayon optimal des nanofibres pour chaque liquide ou mélange de liquides possible. En considérant la puissance critique et le seuil de dommage de nos nanofibres, nous avons déduit la longueur minimale d’interaction. Les conditions d’adiabacité des parties évasées menant à la nanofibre sont également discutées. Ces spécifications nous ont amenés à développer une plateforme de tirage de nanofibres spécifiquement dédiée à ces expériences de non-linéarités évanescentes. Cette palteforme nous permet de tirer des nanofibres de diamètre allant jusqu’à 200 nm sur des longueurs de 10 cm, avec plus de 90 % de transmission. Avec ces nanofibres, nous avons mis en évidence le premier ordre Stokes de l’éthanol dans le champ évanescent d’une nanofibre, ainsi que les premier et second ordres Stokes du toluène. Ces premières expériences sont en très bon accord avec nos simulations et ouvrent la voie à de nombreuses expériences en optique non linéaire...|$|R
