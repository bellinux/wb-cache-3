40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{in vitro}} immunoassay for the infectivity of Autographa californica {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} was developed and performed in six different lepidopteran cell lines. The assay was not dependent upon cytopathic effect or polyhedron production, but rather upon viral antigen production and its recognition in a <b>peroxidase-antiperoxidase</b> <b>staining</b> <b>procedure.</b> The importance of using such an assay for accurately assessing infectivity in cell lines which produce polyhedra inefficiently was demonstrated. Differences among the cell lines in sensitivity to viral infection were clearly shown. Differences in {{the time required to}} produce infectious progeny were also noted among cells of the same cell line...|$|E
40|$|Using a <b>peroxidase-antiperoxidase</b> <b>staining</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{formalin}} fixed paraffin embedded {{sections of}} fetal and normal kidney; benign (mesoblastic nephroma); and malignant tumours (Wilms' tumour, clear cell renal carcinoma, rhabdoid renal tumour, and bone metastasising renal tumour of childhood (BMRTC] were examined for their reactivity with antisera to fibronectin, laminin, and epithelial membrane antigen. Mesoblastic nephroma contained fibronectin but no laminin. Most Wilms' tumours lacked both fibronectin and laminin; 50 % of rhabdoid renal tumours were positive for fibronectin and laminin [...] rhabdoid tumours as recognised morphologically may, in fact, be two separate entities. BMRTC and clear cell renal carcinoma lacked both fibronectin and laminin. Epithelial membrane antigen {{was present in}} most of the tubular Wilms' tumour but absent in blastemal Wilms' tumours. The presence of epithelial membrane antigen in rhabdoid tumours was surprising, as histologically, this type of tumour shows no sign of epithelial differentiation. Epithelial membrane antigen antiserum stained clear cell renal carcinomas: epithelial membrane antigen is found in the distal and not the proximal tubules of fetal and normal kidneys. Thus an obvious interpretation is that clear cell renal carcinomas originate from distal rather than from proximal tubules, as has always been thought. On the basis of these results and data from other published findings some possible histogenetic origins of childhood renal tumours were proposed...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Studies were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of cyclopropenoid fatty acids (CPFA) on the microsomal membrane of livers of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri). Slab and tube gel electrophoresis of microsomes from trout fed a CPFA diet (CPFA-microsomes) for varying time periods showed a decrease in the number of protein bands resolved in the high molecular weight region. This disappearance of high molecular weight proteins was not due to increased proteolysis in the CPFA-microsomes. Antibodies against whole microsomal protein from livers of trout fed 300 ppm CPFA were produced in rabbits. Microsomal proteins were first separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred to nitrocellulose sheets (NC) and analyzed by the <b>peroxidase-antiperoxidase</b> (PAP) immunochemical <b>staining</b> <b>procedure.</b> Immunoabsorption of antisera directed against CPFA-microsomes by control-microsomes did not reveal any new proteins induced by the CPFA diets. However, the intensity of PAP staining was much greater in CPFA microsomes after immunoabsorption. Hydrolysis of phospholipids in the microsomal membrane by phospholipase A₂ failed to reveal any differences between control and CPFA fed trout. Proteolysis of microsomal membrane proteins had similar effects on NADPH cytochrome reductase and cytochrome P- 450 activity on fish fed the different diets. PAGE analysis of these digests did show some differences in digested proteins between the control and CPFA group. These results may reflect a possible change in orientation of microsomal membrane proteins brought about by CPFA in the diet. Additional evidence for altered orientation of proteins was found with PAGE analysis of trypsin-digested microsomes. Moreover incubation of trypsin-digested microsomes with antisera and stained with PAP showed that proteolytic attack was different between control and CPFA microsomes. A final study with incubation of transferred proteins from control and CPFA-microsomes with antisera directed against purified cytochrome P- 450 (P- 450) and cytochrome P- 448 (P- 448) showed that CPFA had an effect on the concentration of P- 448 but not P- 450...|$|R
40|$|A rapid {{neutralization}} test for influenza A and B viruses was developed.

In the presence of trypsin and tragacanth gum, clear foci developed 1 day after infection. A linear relationship between virus dilutions and numbers of foci was observed. When neutralizing antibodies in some test sera were assayed, a good correlation was observed between the titers obtained by the focus method and those obtained by the ordinary plaque method. In addition, many serum specimens were investigated by the {{neutralization test}}, and it was demonstrated that the test is useful for serological studies of influenza...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} of toxoplasma antigen(s) to {{the origin and}} long-term persistence of the mononuclear cell inflammatory infiltrate that {{is present in the}} brains of mice chronically infected with Toxoplasma gondii was studied by using the <b>peroxidase-antiperoxidase</b> immunohistochemical <b>staining</b> technique. C 3 H/Km mice were infected with the avirulent C 37 strain of T. gondii and sequentially sacrificed over the ensuing 107 days. Comparable sections of each brain were prepared for routine light microscopy. Antisera to toxoplasma made in rabbits were used for immunohistological staining, and adjacent slides were also stained with conventional histological <b>stains.</b> The <b>peroxidase-antiperoxidase</b> <b>stain</b> demonstrated toxoplasma tissue cysts, tachyzoites, and intra- and extracellular antigen-antibody reaction products. Early infection was characterized by small tight clusters of free tachyzoites gaining access to brain substance {{in the absence of an}} inflammatory response. Once there was disruption of neural parenchyma, a mononuclear cellular infiltrate rapidly ensued. After the first days of infection, mononuclear cells were always present in all infected brains and were anatomically associated with some component of toxoplasma antigen(s). The histological picture of late infection suggested that recurrent episodes of hematogenous dissemination of tachyzoites occurred in infected mice and that such episodes were at least partially responsible for persistence of an antigenic stimulus...|$|R

40|$|An enzyme {{immunoassay}} (EIA), Chlamydiazyme (Abbott Laboratories), was evaluated for its determination of MICs of 15 antimicrobial agents against Chlamydia trachomatis (MRC- 1, LB, TRIC/GB/MRC- 1 Gf [ATCC VR- 1]). The inoculum size, incubation time, and enhancers were defined {{for the assessment}} of chlamydial antigen synthesis in HeLa 229 cells seeded as monolayers in 96 -well plates. MICs were determined and defined as the lowest antibiotic concentrations required to inhibit, after 24 or 48 h of incubation, antigen production as determined by the EIA. The MICs (after 48 h) were similar to those determined by the <b>peroxidase-antiperoxidase</b> <b>staining</b> of inclusions. MIC determinations after 24 h were suitable for screening the activities of quinolones, but less so for measuring the susceptibility of C. trachomatis to macrolides and tetracyclines.

The cold variant produced a mild meningitis and no necrotic lesions. In both viral infections, the neuron {{seemed to be the}} target cell at the early stages. Infection with the wild-type strain was able to spread through host tissues and produce confluent lesions, whereas infection with the cold mutant seemed to be confined to individual neurons.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{standardize}} slide preparation and <b>staining</b> <b>procedures</b> to improve the efficiency and effectivity of the IVOS system on normal sperm morphology readings with regard to the strict criteria. Semen samples from patients attending the Reproductive Biology Unit, Tygerberg Hospital, were used. In experiment 1, five different Diff-Quik <b>staining</b> <b>procedures,</b> including the standard procedure, were evaluated on each of 22 patients and the effect of slide preparation within 1 h or more than 5 h after collection and the effect of immediate fixation versus fixation after 24 h were observed. In experiment 2, the manual evaluation time per slide (n = 20) by two technicians was compared with the time taken by computer. In experiment 1 the median % normal for the 5 different <b>staining</b> <b>procedures</b> was 6, 6. 5, 9. 5, 8. 5, and 5. 5 %. No significant difference was found between the different <b>staining</b> <b>procedures</b> (p =. 60, nonparametric Friedman test). In experiment 2 the mean time for manual assessment by two technicians was 3 min: 6 s and 3 min: 53 s per slide as compared to 4 min: 39 s by computer. For experiment 1, slides can be prepared immediately or after 5 h. Fixation time also does not interfere with the computer's ability to identify normal forms. For experiment 2, the IVOS system is competitive regarding assessment time. Standardization of optimum <b>staining</b> <b>procedures</b> is important to ensure repeatability and comparability.

40|$|A mouse {{monoclonal}} antibody (MAb) to dengue 4 (DEN- 4) virus reacted with the antigen in the nucleus {{as well as}} in the cytoplasm of DEN- 4 -infected mammalian and mosquito cells, as demonstrated by the <b>peroxidase-antiperoxidase</b> <b>staining</b> method. The intranuclear antigen appeared to accumulate at the nucleoli, forming spots, whereas the cytoplasmic antigen appeared to be localized mainly in large perinuclear loci in the infected cells. The MAb-reactive antigen was produced in the presence of actinomycin D, which caused the accumulation in the nucleus to be altered to a dispersed pattern. Radioimmunoprecipitation analysis of [35 S]methionine-labelled purified virions and Western blot analysis of the antigens prepared from the infected mammalian and mosquito cells showed that the MAb was directed against he DEN- 4 virus core protein (M ~ 15 - 5 K). These results indicated that the DEN- 4 virus core protein was partially transported, soon after its synthesis in the cytoplasm, into the nucleus and accumulated at the nucleoli...|$|R

40|$|Laser-capture microdissection (LCM) {{enables the}} {{selection}} of a specific and pure cell population from a heterogenous tissue such as tumors. Activity-based protein profiling/profile (ABPP) is a chemical technology using enzyme-specific active site-directed probes to read out the functional state of many enzymes directly in any proteome. The aim of this work was to assess the compatibility of LCM with downstream ABPP for serine hydrolase (SH) in human lung adenocarcinoma. Fresh frozen lung adenocarcinoma tissue was stained with hematoxylin, toluidine blue, or methyl green (MG). Proteome from stained tissue was labeled further with SH-directed probes, and ABPPs were determined on a one-dimensional gel-based approach. This allowed us {{to assess the impact of}} <b>staining</b> <b>procedures</b> on their ABPPs. The effect of the LCM process on ABPPs was assessed furthermore using MG-stained lung adenocarcinoma tissue. The <b>staining</b> <b>procedures</b> led to strong changes in ABPPs.
