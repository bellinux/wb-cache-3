5|$|The dogs of {{all these}} islands were short, and their sizes vary {{from that of a}} lap-dog to the largest spaniel. Their head is broad, the snout <b>pointed,</b> <b>the</b> eyes very small, the ears upright, and their hair rather long, lank, hard, and of {{different}} colours, but most commonly white and brown. They seldom if ever barked, but howled sometimes, and were shy of strangers to a degree of aversion.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{was fond}} of {{pointing}} out that Alessandro Volta, working in his laboratory, could have {{had no idea where}} the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle <b>pointed</b> <b>the</b> way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E
5|$|In January and February 2015, 1450 {{malnourished}} or sick {{sea lion}} pups {{have been found}} {{on the coast of}} California, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has <b>pointed</b> <b>the</b> cause to unprecedentedly warm PDO in the North American west coast {{as a result of a}} failed attempt at El Niño, which has reduced the abundance of anchovies, sardines and mackerel, principal components of the sea lion diet just in the pups nursery season. Pups are leaving the rookeries in search of food long before they are capable of hunting fish. The outcome is pups really malnourished washed out on the shores. These conditions lead some of these pups to death if not rescued in time.|$|E
5000|$|Each couple {{performed}} two dances. The {{first was}} scored normally. The second, the marathon dance, was different. All nine couples performed a Mambo {{at the same}} time. One by one, the judges asked a couple to leave the floor. The first couple to leave received 2 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> second couple got 3 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> third couple got 4 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> fourth couple got 5 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> fifth couple got 6 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> sixth couple got 7 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> seventh couple got 8 <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> eighth couple got 9 <b>points,</b> and <b>the</b> last remaining couple got 10 points. Therefore, a team could have earned a maximum of 40 points in Week 6.|$|R

5|$|The second {{classification}} was <b>the</b> <b>points</b> classification.

5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} has a diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc about a sixth wider than long, with broadly rounded outer corners. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are nearly straight and converge {{at the tip of}} the snout at up to a 130° angle; the anterior disc shape distinguishes this species from the similar Atlantic stingray (D.sabina), which has a longer, more acute snout. The mouth is curved, with a central projection on the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There is a row of five papillae across the floor of the mouth, with the outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 36–50 upper tooth rows; the teeth have quadrangular bases and are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces. The tooth crowns are rounded in females and juveniles, while those of males in breeding condition are triangular and <b>pointed.</b> <b>The</b> pelvic fins are triangular with rounded tips.|$|E
5|$|The fins are {{strongly}} falcate (sickle-shaped), particularly the dorsal fins, pelvic fins, and lower caudal fin lobe. The pectoral fins are narrow and <b>pointed.</b> <b>The</b> first dorsal fin is positioned about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds as tall as the first and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin. The anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin. The dorsal surface of the caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping; each has five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey or bronze above, often with small white spots on the sides, and pale below. The dorsal fins are tipped in white, which is especially obvious on the second dorsal as the remainder of fin is mostly dark.|$|E
5|$|Vasey slowly recovered. In October 1944, Blamey {{set up a}} Post-War Army Planning Committee {{headed by}} Vasey {{to report on the}} future of the Royal Military College and the {{training}} and education of Staff Corps officers. Vasey called for a greatly expanded regular army of 20,000 men. His report recommended that the course at Duntroon be deepened professionally and academically to the level of an undergraduate university degree. The report's recommendations were not accepted or welcomed by the government but <b>pointed</b> <b>the</b> way to the future, in which the Army would become increasingly professional. In February 1945, Frank Forde pressed for Vasey to be given another active command. Blamey, who still had doubts about Vasey's physical fitness despite Vasey being given an A by an Army medical board, reluctantly appointed him to command the 6th Division, then in action in the Aitape-Wewak campaign.|$|E

25|$|Evidence emerged {{by the end}} of the 1970s {{that the}} newly {{discovered}} proton pump (H+/K+ ATPase) in the secretory membrane of the parietal cell was the final step in acid secretion. Literature from anaesthetic screenings led attention to the potential antiviral compound pyridylthioacetamide which after further examination <b>pointed</b> <b>the</b> focus on an anti-secretory compound with unknown mechanisms of action called timoprazole. Timoprazole is a pyridylmethylsulfinyl benzimidazole and appealed due to its simple chemical structure and its surprisingly high level of anti-secretory activity.|$|E

25|$|Stellar X-ray {{astronomy}} {{is said to}} {{have started}} on April 5, 1974, with the detection of X-rays from Capella. A rocket flight on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor <b>pointed</b> <b>the</b> payload axis at Capella (α Aur). During this period, X-rays in the range 0.2–1.6 keV were detected by an X-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor. The X-ray luminosity of Lx = 1031 erg·s−1 (1024 W) is four orders of magnitude above the Sun's X-ray luminosity.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} for a class of graphs that is not closed under minors to have bounded local treewidth. In particular {{this is true of}} the 1-planar graphs, graphs that can be drawn in the plane with one crossing per edge, and more generally for the graphs that can be drawn on a surface of bounded genus with a bounded number of crossings per edge. As with minor-closed graph families of bounded local treewidth, this property has <b>pointed</b> <b>the</b> way to efficient approximation algorithms for these graphs.|$|E
25|$|After {{experiencing}} several 'Window attacks', the Luftwaffe {{started to}} change its tactics. With radar neutralised by Window, German night fighters {{found it difficult to}} intercept the bombers. However, German ground controllers no longer used radar sets to guide German fighters and track individual enemy bombers in order to intercept. Instead, they gave a running commentary on the stream as a whole. No individual aircraft were tracked unless caught in searchlights. These changes did not produce immediate success, but <b>pointed</b> <b>the</b> way to a method of loosely controlled cat's eye interception. The success of the new tactics were indicated in increasing bomber losses.|$|E
