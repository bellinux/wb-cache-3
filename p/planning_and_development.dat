5|$|The Blackstone Hotel was {{designed}} by architect Benjamin Marshall, of Marshall and Fox, in 1909. Sources vary as to the precise style in which Marshall designed the building. According to the Landmarks Division of the City of Chicago's Department of <b>Planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development,</b> the hotel's exterior and interior are considered {{an excellent example of}} neoclassical Beaux-Arts architecture; the nomination form for the building's listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places classifies the structure as distinctly Second Empire. However, the two styles are related, and the Blackstone Hotel demonstrates elements from both schools. The design was influenced by Marshall's trip to Paris, after which he completed the hotel.|$|E

5|$|The British {{arrival in}} Jerusalem heralded a {{rational}} philosophy of infrastructure <b>planning</b> <b>and</b> <b>development.</b> It respected cultural and historic heritage {{and attempted to}} preserve such elements within the blossoming construction of the modern city. The city walls were identified as such an element, so British workers acted to clear away the stalls on their perimeter and maintain an open area between {{the walls and the}} rest of the New City in the interest of an aesthetically pleasing visual basin. By the same token, planners demolished the Ottoman clock tower to preserve a historic skyline.|$|E

As well as indigenous languages, documents would also be published in English, Chinese and Malay.
