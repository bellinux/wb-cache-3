5000|$|James Siena (born October 28, 1957) is an American {{contemporary}} artist {{based in}} New York City. His art is typically created {{through a series}} of self-imposed constraints also sometimes referred to as visual algorithms —rules Siena decides on before sitting down to work. In most of his work he establishes a basic unit and action and repeats it indefinitely. [...] Siena commented that, [...] "at a certain <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make drawings and works that act as machines. The way they act as machines is you have to find your way into them and find your way out of them. As you undo the making of them they come to life." ...|$|R

If so, I cannot help it, and must decline entirely to water down or doctor facts and thus pander to his prejudice and ignorance.

But neglect and carelessness {{are not at all}} the points. The Bible hardly ever talks about neglect of the poor. It always talks of oppression of the poor--a very different matter. It does not merely speak of passing by on the other side, and binding up no wounds, but of drawing the sword and ourselves smiting the men down. It does not charge us with being idle in the pest-house, and giving no medicine, but with being busy in the pest-house, and giving much poison.|$|E

Baseball is my favorite game, and I have always been proud of Wayne's teams. The new eligibility rules, with which you are all familiar, were brought to me, and after thoroughly going over the situation I approved of them. Certainly it is obvious to you all that a university ball-player making himself famous here, and then playing during the summer months at a resort, is laying himself open to suspicion. I have no doubt that many players are innocent of the taint of professionalism, but unfortunately they have become members of these summer teams after being first requested, then warned, not to do so.|$|E

Each of us is part of a system that's built up, we believe, on the rock of the constitution. Otherwise, if you were merely individuals, doing just as you wished, obeying nobody, you could live only like the Indians, holding your ranches and cattle--if you had them--with the rifle. All commerce and security is founded on the fact that we're not separate men, but a nation. Well, the nation wants troops, and warships, judges, courts, schools, and roads. It expects you to pay your share, since you get the benefit, and every man who beats it out of one tax or duty is playing a mean game on and stealing from the rest.

Not one of them, when he is at home, is allowed to order the dinner or poke his nose into his own kitchen or check the household books....

If you think you're going through hard times, you can always turn on the TV to see someone else who's going through things 10 times worse than you.

60|$|The second <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{make about}} {{instruction}} {{is the importance}} of youth. In America, where they contemplate a labour shortage of 2,000,000 men on their farms, they are using boys from sixteen to twenty-one, when their military age begins. Can we not do the same here? Most of our boys from fifteen to eighteen are now on other work. But the work they are doing could surely be done by girls or women. If we could put even a couple of hundred thousand boys of that age on the land it would be the solution of our present agricultural labour shortage, and the very best thing that could happen for the future of farming. The boys would learn at first hand; they would learn slowly and thoroughly; and many of them would stay on the land. They might be given specialised schooling in agriculture, the most important schooling we can give our rising generation, while all of them would gain physically. By employing women on the land, where we can employ boys of from fifteen to eighteen, we are blind-alleying. Women will not stay on the land in any numbers; few will wish that they should. Boys will, and every one would wish that they may.|$|E

5000|$|I am {{suggesting}} in H.R. 13567 that {{we honor}} 10 {{individuals who have}} been distinguished contributors to the arts—music, painting, writing, architecture and the theatre.
