40|$|Ghana started {{commercial}} oil production in 2010 {{and as part}} of strategies to facilitate linkages between {{the oil and gas industry}} and the Ghanaian economy, a local content law was passed in 2013. This PhD thesis examines whether and how Ghana’s local content law enhances the opportunities for local participation in the petroleum sector. With a focus on Ghanaian SMEs’ and drawing on relational perspectives in geography that emphasise the embeddedness of economic action, the thesis highlights the complex social processes that shape the impacts of natural resources extraction on society. The thesis examines Ghanaian entrepreneurs’ strategies of drawing on networks to acquire information, build trust and mobilise financial capital in their attempt to gain entry and participate in the oil and gas industry. The study argues that the social and economic capitals relevant for local entrepreneurial activities in the oil industry are relatively inaccessible for SMEs. The thesis also explores the ways in which a state-led Enterprise Development Centre (EDC) enhances the opportunities for SMEs’ <b>participation</b> in the <b>oil</b> industry. While the EDC enhances the capacities of SMEs through training, this study contends that the benefits of the EDC in terms of promoting SMEs’ <b>participation</b> in the <b>oil</b> industry are limited. With emphasis on the micro-mechanisms of power embedded in the techniques and practices of MNCs, the state and local companies, the thesis examines the emerging relations of power between actors and highlights how these influence the opportunities for SMEs <b>participation</b> in the <b>oil</b> and gas sector. Through extensive fieldwork conducted in Ghana’s oil industry over a period of three years, the study concludes that Ghana’s local content law is largely beneficial to local elites and does not stimulate broad-based social and economic benefits. The case studies of Ghana entrepreneurial activities show how embedded resources and practices of actors shape local SMEs <b>participation</b> in the <b>oil</b> and gas industry. </p...|$|R

In particular, Part I raises questions about the empirical evidence used by Ross, especially the selection of case-studies, the specification of the econometric models, and the lack of direct evidence for cultural values.

Burma is situated to the south of the states of Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh in Northeast India. and the proximity of the People's Republic of China gives strategic importance to Indo-Burmese relations.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to knowledge by demonstrating how organisational {{policies and practices}} {{can make a difference}} to increasing women’s expatriate <b>participation</b> in the <b>oil</b> and gas exploration and production sector. Through a census survey of female international assignees and in-depth interviews addressing their concerns in a UK-based case study setting, it explains why women hold such a low volume (approximately one-tenth) of the sector’s expatriate roles. International assignments are a business necessity as expatriates supply specialist skills and strategic vision. Given skills shortages in the sector, the case for increasing expatriate gender diversity is strong. This study is important and timely as, thus far, we know very little about how organisational policy and practice can increase expatriate gender participation. Hence, this thesis addresses deficiencies in the extant literature and contributes new academic knowledge. It also provides practical suggestions to enable organisations to widen expatriate gender diversity. The thesis identifies the effects of horizontal and vertical segregation, assignment type and underpinning organisational policies on women’s expatriate participation. Relatively few women are suitably qualified for the majority of expatriate engineering and exploration posts. Yet, even when they hold appropriate qualifications, women experience intense competition for career-enhancing expatriation and are segregated into noninternationally mobile occupations. As international experience is a prerequisite for career development, women are disadvantaged. Women prefer long-term accompanied assignments as these provide the highest career contribution coupled with home life/ family stability, underpinned by generous remuneration/ benefits packages. Unaccompanied shortterm, rotational and commuter assignments are less attractive. As assignment lengths shorten due to cost and other pressures, career contribution and family life and, consequently, women’s expatriate participation are affected detrimentally. Organisational policy supporting expatriation is implemented formally and informally. Yet, strong reliance on high levels of networking to gain expatriate roles potentially creates and reinforces vertical segregation. While equal opportunity is espoused and diversity policy is in place, strategic and operational action to increase women’s share of expatriation is lacking. A meritocracy prevails and women compete in an expatriate ‘male game’...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{potential}} and practicality of incorporating multi-stakeholder participation into {{the legal and}} institutional frameworks for managing Nigeria’s oil and gas. Despite the natural resource wealth embedded in the Niger Delta, her people suffer greatly from social, economic and infrastructural underdevelopment and this thesis argues that failure to respect {{the right of the}} Niger Delta communities to participate in Nigeria’s oil and gas management and in developmental projects that affect their lives is the foundation of the resource curse besetting the region. As a solution to the resource curse problem of the Niger Delta and in response to the incessant conflicts, environmental degradation, social, economic and infrastructural underdevelopment and military injustice perpetrated in the region, this thesis promotes the enforcement of the right to participation of the Niger Delta peoples through the incorporation of the United Nations promoted Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue Approach (MSDA) and this argument is based on the Participatory Development Theory (PDT). The thesis proposes legal and institutional frameworks to ensure the effective incorporation of the MSDA into Nigeria’s oil and gas regime. Other than the human rights basis for promoting the participatory development of the Niger Delta peoples, the thesis examines the business case for participatory development as an incentive to encourage oil and gas companies operating in the Niger Delta to inculcate the values of the MSDA. This thesis establishes that incorporating the MSDA into Nigeria’s oil and gas legal and institutional regime in furtherance of the participatory development of the Niger Delta communities will promote environmental sustainability, peaceful coexistence, better informed decision making processes and economic and social sustainability among others. Though there are other rights infringement issues that bear {{on the development of the}} Niger Delta communities, it is anticipated that recognition of the Niger Delta peoples as stakeholders and their effective <b>participation</b> in Nigeria’s <b>oil</b> and gas management will give them a voice and opportunity to significantly address other human rights issues and to hold other stakeholders accountable...|$|R
40|$|Since 2005, the Thai {{government}} has, as {{a matter}} of policy, been seeking to increase production of biodiesel from oil palms. As a result, the number of oil palm plantations in the Northeast region has been growing, particularly in Nong Khai province. Nong Khai is a relatively remote, predominantly agricultural area and is the field site for this research. However, oil palm production is a complex and hotly contested issue both globally and in Thailand and it has ardent critics and supporters. For example, expanding oil palm production could, on the one hand, contribute to deforestation and a range of social problems that threaten traditional livelihoods, whilst on the other hand it could offer a source of renewable energy, alleviate poverty, and lead to a higher standard of living for farmers. The ultimate {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the changeover to oil palm production, specifically in the Thai context, through the development and application of a distinctive analytical approach. This approach is a synthesis of: the eight elements of farmers’ decision-making (Ohlmer et al., 1998), the IDS Knowledge, Technology, and Society (KNOTS) team’s framework on policy processes (Keeley and Scoones, 1999; 2001; 2003; KNOTS, 2006). This analytical approach is used to investigate factors influencing farmers’ decisions to take up oil palm cultivation, and the rationale behind the government’s oil palm policy and how it is implemented in the Northeast Thailand. Approximately nine months were spent carrying out the research in three selected villages in Nong Khai province, using qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews, purposive sampling and snowballing techniques. The results show that economic security is an important factor for farmers in deciding to change over to oil palm cultivation. However, it has emerged that what farmers really want is to achieve a comfortable lifestyle and to live in the same locality as their children, which implies urban to rural migration. Other critical factors are characteristic of oil palm cultivation, such as long life-span and short harvesting period, governmental projects supporting oil palm production, the roles of inspirational local leaders and large-scale oil palm producers, the price of oil palm fruits, the links between farmers and local buyers, and the experiences of oil palm growers in the southern region of Thailand, as well as the low productivity and high production costs involved in rice cultivation, and the success of rubber plantations. The findings also suggest that the oil palm policy processes in Nong Khai province do not have policy space for farmers to participate in the networks, or to design the oil palm policy that directly affects them. The policy was made in top-down in which the government only transferred oil palm knowledge through seminars and trainings. There were also issues concerning inequality amongst farmers and how that affects <b>participation</b> in the <b>oil</b> palm projects. Indeed, the OPPSP favours rich farmers, as they need a significant amount of capital to prepare for and maintain oil palm crops. Implementation of a ‘farmer-first’ approach is recommended in order to push the policy forward to serve resource-poor farmers properly. New behaviours and attitudes must be encouraged in most of the professionals encountered in this research...|$|R
