5|$|Media in the Eastern Bloc was {{an organ}} of the state, {{completely}} reliant on and subservient to the communist party, with radio and television organizations being state-owned, while print media was usually owned by <b>political</b> <b>organizations,</b> mostly by the local communist party. Soviet propaganda used Marxist philosophy to attack capitalism, claiming labor exploitation and war-mongering imperialism were inherent in the system.|$|E
5|$|Once in power, Adolf Hitler soon {{banned the}} Social Democratic Party and other <b>political</b> <b>organizations.</b> Concerned for his family's safety, Kellner {{moved to the}} town of Laubach in Hesse, where he became the chief justice inspector: the {{judicial}} officer in charge of the administration of the courthouse. When Hitler ordered the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Kellner began his secret diary to record the crimes of the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|As {{his term}} neared expiration, Laffoon removed Ben Johnson {{from his post}} as highway commissioner, {{replacing}} him with Tom Rhea. This move was made in order to groom Rhea {{to be the next}} governor. Due to the influence of Laffoon and Rhea, the Democratic Party again chose a nominating convention in lieu of a primary to choose their gubernatorial candidate. Because Laffoon supporters controlled the state Democratic Central Committee and most of the county <b>political</b> <b>organizations,</b> a convention would favor Laffoon's choice of gubernatorial nominee. The convention was scheduled for May 14, 1935 in Lexington.|$|E

40|$|This study {{considers}} the spaces occupied by Maya royal rituals {{as a means}} of testing the application of models of <b>political</b> <b>organization.</b> Investigation of the architectonics of several temple pyramids at the sites of Copan, Tikal, and Seibal indicates that Maya <b>political</b> <b>organization</b> does not resemble that required by either the galactic polity or segmentary state models. Comparison with large Mesopotamian temples from Early Dynastic levels at Khafaje and al-'Ubaid suggests that the royal rituals of the Classic Maya are indicative of a city-state <b>political</b> <b>organization...</b>|$|R
5|$|Georgetown {{has many}} {{additional}} groups representing national, ethnic, and linguistic interests. Georgetown's has {{the second most}} politically active student body in the United States according to the Princeton Review. Groups based on local, national, and international issues are popular, and political speech is protected on campus. Student <b>political</b> <b>organizations</b> are active on campus and engage their many members in local and national politics. The Georgetown University College Republicans represent their party, while the Georgetown University College Democrats, the largest student organization on campus in 2008, represent theirs.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Howe {{introduced}} her to representatives of women's <b>political</b> <b>organizations,</b> with which she became active, and watched and critiqued her speeches to these groups. The pair even developed a system of hand signals that Howe would use while she spoke to warn {{her if she was}} lapsing into a bad habit. He encouraged her to express herself in print as well, and acted for a time as her literary agent.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Nazi occupation, some Belgians collaborated with their occupiers. There were pro-Nazi <b>political</b> <b>organizations</b> in both Flemish and Walloon {{communities}} {{before and during the}} war. The most significant were DeVlag, Verdinaso and Vlaams Nationaal Verbond (VNV) in Flanders as well as the Catholic Rex movement in Wallonia. Each of these movements had subtly different ideologies, their own paramilitary forces and printed their own newspapers. These organisations were also instrumental in encouraging Belgians to enlist into the German Army. Unlike the German-style National Socialist agenda of DeVlag, VNV appealed directly to a Flemish separatist agenda, though this message was never the main source of their popularity. Infighting between the groups, particularly VNV and DeVlag, was considerable.|$|E

5|$|For the 2010–2011 {{academic}} year, Florida Atlantic had approximately 300registered student organizations. Among {{the groups}} are academic organizations, honor societies, spiritual/religious organizations, diversity-appreciation organizations, service organizations, personal interest organizations, sports clubs, and student government agencies. These clubs and organizations {{run the gamut from}} sailing to Ultimate Frisbee, from varsity and club sports and a jazz group to a pottery guild, from <b>political</b> <b>organizations</b> to chess and video game clubs. These organizations are funded by student tuition, from which $10.00 per credit hour goes toward an activities and service fee fund. This generates approximately $9million that is then given to student government for allocation to student clubs and organizations. The student government also finances other student life programs, including career fairs, the University Press, OWL TV and Owl Radio, and Homecoming.|$|E
5|$|Gay men {{and lesbians}} came {{together}} to work in grassroots <b>political</b> <b>organizations</b> responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E
5|$|Students are {{involved}} in the community, and PHC requires its Government students to fulfill up to 24 credits of apprenticeship projects, which include internships, research and writing projects, and extracurricular activities such as moot court, Model United Nations, and Mock Trial. Students currently serve as interns {{in a wide variety of}} <b>political</b> <b>organizations,</b> such as congressional offices and think-tanks. Students are active in local and national politics, and members of the Patrick Henry College Republicans chapter often work with local political action groups to lobby for conservative issues at the federal and state levels. Classes are canceled the day of the national elections and the day before, so that students may volunteer on political campaigns; and many students act as Student Action Team leaders for Generation Joshua, leading groups of usually homeschooled high school students volunteering on campaigns across the United States.|$|E

5|$|Variations of this flag {{were used}} during the Belarusian People's Republic in 1918–1919. The white-red-white flag is still used by the Republic's government-in-exile. Lasting from 1919 until 1925, {{the flag of the}} BPR {{retained}} the white, red, white design, but with the addition of black stripes at {{the top and bottom of}} the red stripe. Between 1921 and 1939 the white-red-white flag was used by the Belarusian national movement in West Belarus (part of the Second Polish Republic), both by <b>political</b> <b>organizations</b> like the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union or the Belarusian Christian Democracy, and non-political organizations like the Belarusian Schools Society. The flag was also used by the Belarusian Special Battalion in the army of the Republic of Lithuania. After the invasion of Poland and the annexation of modern-day West Belarus in 1939 the flag was forbidden by the Soviet administration in the newly acquired territories as well.|$|E
5|$|Saint Anselm offers over 100 student {{organizations}} on campus, including arts & culture organizations, performance groups, sports groups, <b>political</b> <b>organizations,</b> religious organizations, {{and social}} action groups. The Student Activities Office encourages {{and is available}} for students wishing to develop an organization not yet established at Saint Anselm. Clubs on campus include The Knights of Columbus, Alpha Phi Omega, Abbey Players, Campus Activities Board, Classics Society, The History Society, Democrats, Republicans, Green Team, Italian Club, Dance Club, Muslim Student Association, Jazz Band, Organization for Life, Mock Trial, Psychology Club, and Yearbook Club. An example of the college students being active in the local community is that the Saint Anselm College Knights of Columbus, Council 4785 in Manchester, New Hampshire won the 2009–2010 National Community Activity Award for creating a comprehensive recycling program at the New Hampshire State Prison for Women. The Campus Activities Board (CAB), a student-run organization, runs several committees that oversee campus-wide activities and student services. In 2008, CAB organized singer Howie Day, in 2009, the band Third Eye Blind performed at the college. Jason Derulo and Matt Nathanson performed there in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first {{instances}} of homosexuals fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' Black Cat Tavern in 1967. However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the raid was a factor: it was {{across the street from}} The Village Voice offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police. Many of the participants and residents of Greenwich Village were involved in <b>political</b> <b>organizations</b> that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community {{in the weeks and months}} after the rebellion. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual Gay Pride events around the world.|$|E
