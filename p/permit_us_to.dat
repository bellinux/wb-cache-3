40|$|AbstractWe show in {{this paper}} that the average over {{translations}} of an operator diagonal in a wavelet packet basis is a convolution. We also show that an operator diagonal in a wavelet packet basis can be decomposed into several operators of the same kind, each of them being better conditioned. We investigate {{the possibility of using}} such a convolution to approximate a given convolution (in practice an image blur). Then we use these approximations to deblur images.

2500|$|As Bury points out, [...] "It {{is highly}} {{important}} {{to observe that}} Odovacar established his political power with the co-operation of the Roman Senate, and this body seems to have given him their loyal support throughout his reign, so far as our meagre sources <b>permit</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> draw inferences." [...] He regularly nominated members of the Senate to the Consulate and other prestigious offices: [...] "Basilius, Decius, Venantius, and Manlius Boethius held the consulship and were either Prefects of Rome or Praetorian Prefects; Symmachus and Sividius were consuls and Prefects of Rome; another senator of old family, Cassiodorus, was appointed a minister of finance." [...] A. H. M. Jones also notes that under Odoacer the Senate acquired [...] "enhanced prestige and influence" [...] in order to counter any desires for restoration of Imperial rule. As the most tangible example of this renewed prestige, {{for the first time}} since the mid-3rd century copper coins were issued with the legend S(enatus) C(onsulto). Jones describes these coins as [...] "fine big copper pieces", which were [...] "a great improvement on the miserable little nummi hitherto current", and not only were they copied by the Vandals in Africa, but they formed the basis of the currency reform by Anastasius in the Eastern Empire.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Collectif Assistance Juridique (CAJ) {{independent}} group, a {{total of}} 4,500 people were arrested during the events. Among them, 1,950 were kept in garde à vue and 635 prosecution cases opened. Less than 15% of the arrested people were therefore [...] presented to the magistrates, due to insufficient evidence of alleged legal violations. The CAJ note {{that many of the}} people presented before the courts had no previous criminal record and were far from the profile of [...] "criminal rioters". They included many leaders of the movement, in particular outside Paris. A 24 March 2006 internal administrative order asked the magistrates not to be too lenient on their judgments. 42% of the persons presented before courts passed in immediate comparution, a specific (and controversial) procedure, which allow them to be judged on the spot. During the 1994 demonstrations against the CIP, a student law prepared by Balladur's government, 1000 persons only had been arrested, although the clashes had been more violent. Although Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy stated on 16 March that his [...] "priority was to arrest casseurs" [...] (rioters), the independent CAJ (Judicial Assistance Group) noted {{that the vast majority of}} arrestations hadn't been of on-the-spot witnessed violence (flagrant délit) and that many were contested. For example, on 31 March a US citizen visiting Paris was detained by the police, while on 7 April an old man getting out of a supermarket was also detained. Furthermore, many young people from the suburbs were blocked from demonstrating in Paris. According to the government, this was to impede turmoils in the capital, but critics such as the CAJ have spoken of a negation of presumption of innocence and of [...] "racial and social discrimination", since some categories of the population – mainly youth living in housing projects, those accused of having taken part in the riots in autumn 2005 – were blocked from exercising their civil rights of demonstrating against a law that affected them as well as other categories of the population. These blockings in suburbs' train stations have provoked in some cases clashes with the police, for example in Savigny-sur-Orge, in Saint-Denis or in Les Ulis... "There is no evidence which <b>permit</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> establish a parallel between the young rioters of November and the disturbing elements of this spring", notes the CAJ report, countering the Interior Minister's claims. Furthermore, police abuse was reported on a number of cases, including Cyril Ferez, a trade union member who entered coma state for several weeks following the 18 March demonstration. In Caen Charlotte entered coma for a day; Victor had two ribs broken, etc. A three-year-old child was placed 24 hours in observation after having inhalaed gas. On 16 March, the Parisian préfecture de police announced that 18 demonstrators had been injured. The IGS (internal affairs department) was charged of Cyril Ferez' case (who was in coma for several weeks) and litigation was initiated against police officers allegedly excessively brutal and violent during arrests. Additionally, cooperation between the police forces and the trade union [...] "service orders" [...] (SO, in charge of the demonstrations) was observed, including handing-over of several demonstrators to the police by the trade union's SO. Finally, the CAJ note the disproportion of sentences toward young demonstrators, while others acts of vandalism currently committed by farmers or viticulturists were more lightly punished. It thus alluded to this Alsatian mayor accused of having burned 14 travel trailers but who was condemned only to six months on parole, contrasting with the sentences given to demonstrators (for example, a high school student condemned to 41 days of jail in Fleury-Mérogis because he had burnt two garbage cans before his school).|$|E
