40|$|In this paper, four {{heuristic}} algorithms for {{the optimal}} allocation of limited optical-layer resources in WDM networks (virtual-topology optimization by routing and wavelength assignment) under static traffic demand are compared. While some previous papers assumed that all connection requests must be necessarily satisfied, {{in this work}} algorithms are studied aiming at comparing their ability in minimizing both the usage of optical-layer resources {{and the number of}} connection requests that cannot be allocated. Thus, this paper reports the results obtained on a 13 -nodes simplified topology of the pan-European optical transport network designed in the COST 239 Project. The results of a few hundreds simulations with different traffic matrices have been gathered, by considering separately the cost of resources allocated and the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> connections. One algorithm resulted best performing, because in most tests it allocated the lowest cost of optical-layer resources. On the other hand, the four algorithms exhibited comparable performance with respect to the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> connections...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} {{for prostate}} cancer patients the comparison of 'in-vivo' measured portal dose images (PDIs) with predictions based on a kilovoltage cone-beam CT scan (CBCT), acquired during the same treatment fraction, as an alternative for pre-treatment verification. For evaluation purposes, predictions were also performed using the patients' planning CTs (pCT). Methods: To get reliable CBCT electron densities for PDI predictions, Hounsfield units from the pCT were mapped onto the CBCT, while accounting for non-rigidity in patient anatomy in an approximate way. PDI prediction accuracy was first validated for an anatomical phantom, using IMRT treatment plans of ten prostate cancer patients. Clinical performance was studied using data acquired for 50 prostate cancer patients. For each patient, 4 - 5 CBCTs were available, {{resulting in a total}} of 1413 evaluated images. Measured and predicted PDIs were compared using γ-analyses with 3 % global dose difference and 3 mm distance to agreement as reference criteria. Moreover, the pass rate for automated PDI comparison was assessed. To quantify improvements in IMRT fluence verification accuracy results from multiple fractions were combined by generating a γ-image with values halfway the minimum and median γ values, pixel by pixel. Results: For patients, CBCT-based PDI predictions showed a high agreement with measurements, with an average <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> pixels <b>of</b> 1. 41 % only. In spite of possible intra-fraction motion and anatomy changes, this was only slightly larger than for phantom measurements (0. 86 %). For pCT-based predictions, the agreement deteriorated (average <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> pixels 2. 98 %), due to an enhanced impact of anatomy variations. For predictions based on CBCT, combination of the first 2 fractions yielded gamma results in close agreement with pre-treatment analyses (average <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> pixels 0. 63 % versus 0. 35 %, <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> beams 0. 6 % versus 0 %). For the pCT-based approach, only combination of the first 5 fractions resulted in acceptable agreement with pre-treatment results. Conclusion: In-room acquired CBCT scans can be used for high accuracy IMRT fluence verification based on in-vivo measured EPID images. Combination of γ results for the first 2 fractions can largely compensate for small accuracy reductions, with respect to pre-treatment verification, related to intra-fraction motion and anatomy changes...|$|R

30|$|It {{is also to}} {{be noted}} that {{stationary}} variogram models (gaussian, spherical, and exponential) are more sensitive than non-stationary ones to the number n of assimilated data; this is {{probably due to the}}ir more complex mathematical formulation which requires a greater value of n to represent more adequately the spatial correlations between measurements, for every spatial scale.

Nevertheless, in Fig.  12 a, b, the trend observed starting from the storm number 17, corresponding to the years for which n is increased (n =  12), suggests that the <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> stationary and non-stationary discarded variogram models may converge to similar values as the number of stations increases.|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approaches to}} reduce the energy consumption of high performance computing (HPC) data centers focus on consolidation and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS).

The profiling based approach is suitable for the scenarios when the jobs or their structure is known at design-time, otherwise, the non-profiling based approach is more suitable. Both the approaches consider jobs containing dependent tasks and exploit efficient allocation combined with identification of voltage/frequency levels of used system cores to jointly optimize value and energy.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how recorded crime trends in New South Wales {{may be affected}} by the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> crimes ‘rejected’ by police as not genuine. Introduction Crime trends in NSW are based on crimes recorded by police and accepted by them as genuine. The trend in any offence can {{be affected by the}} <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> crimes ‘rejected’ by police as not genuine. Crime trends may also be affected by criminal matters being recorded as non-criminal incidents. The Bureau monitors trends in the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> incidents to see whether they could be affecting the trend in recorded crime. Where a significant upward trend in the number <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> crime reports is detected, steps are taken to determine whether the police are complying with the NSW Police Crime Recording Standard (see below). It bears emphasis that criminal incidents may validly be rejected, and hence not counted as crimes, when it can be proven that the alleged incident did not occur. Certain offence types may validly have relatively high levels <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> incidents. For example, abduction and kidnappingi, sexual assault and breach Apprehended Violence Order may involve false reports that can be disproved on further investigation. Stock theft may be reported when stock have wandered off rather than being stolen. A motor vehicle may be reported as stolen but then later the owner may advise that they had simply forgotten where they had left the vehicleii. Vehicles are also sometimes reported stolen by their owners in a bid to defraud insurance companies. Drivers may forget to pay for petrol before driving off from a service station, but then later realise and return to pay – although with Police now requiring service stations to fax a form to report petrol theft, fewer of these incidents are being reported in the first place. A significant increase in the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> crimes <b>rejected</b> does not in and of itself indicate that police are trying to manipulate crime figures to create the appearance of a decrease in crime. It is important to examine the scale of the increase in rejected incidents (is it large enough to have affected trends in recorded crime?), whether the level of rejection lies within acceptable bounds (does it exceed five per cent?) and whether the police can give a satisfactory explanation for the rise in rejected incidents...|$|R

40|$|Modern high {{performance}} computing (HPC) data centers consume huge energy to operate them. Therefore, appropriate measures {{are required to}} reduce their energy consumption. Existing efforts for such measures focus on consolidation and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). However, {{most of them do}} not perform adaptive resource allocation for the executing dependent tasks (or jobs) in order to optimize both value and energy. The value is achieved by completing the execution of a job and it depends on the completion time. A high value is achieved if the job is completed before its deadline, otherwise a lower value. In this paper, we propose an adaptive resource allocation approach that uses design-time profiling results of jobs for efficient allocation and adaptation in order to optimize both value and energy while executing dependent tasks. The profiling results for each job are obtained by exploiting efficient allocation combined with identification of voltage/frequency levels of used system cores and used in adapting to different number of cores based on the monitored execution progress of the job and available cores. Experiments show that the proposed approach enhances the overall value by about 10 % when compare to existing approaches while showing reduction in energy consumption and <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> jobs leading to zero value...|$|R

Therefore, the actual contribution of food quality management to quality performance {{has to be}} revealed. This article investigates the effectiveness of food quality management in the bakery sector. Relations between production quality, quality management and contextual factors were studied from a generic and a specific point of view. On the generic level, performance of quality management was related to contextual factors, i. e. complexity of organisation, production process, and product assortment. Assessment on the specific level revealed that effective quality management activities in the bakery sector were (1) control of strategy, (2) allocation of supplying raw materials, (3) supply control, (4) control of production, (5) control of execution of production tasks, (6) control of receiving orders, and (7) planning of distribution. These quality management activities were effective, since interdependency was found between {{a higher level of}} these activities and a higher score for specific indicators for production quality, i. e. higher results of legislative and technical evaluations, a lower <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> products, and lower <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> complaints about product quality and availability.

30|$|Previous {{structural}} and biochemical studies suggested that Onc 112 mainly {{acts in the}} elongation phase of protein synthesis (Roy et al., 2015; Seefeldt et al., 2015). Consistent with previous model, we found that Onc 112 only moderately inhibits the formation of initiation complexes (Fig. S 7). We proposed a reaction scheme to illustrate mechanisms of Onc 112 in early elongation (Fig.  2 G), in which Onc 112 binds within the polypeptide exit tunnel and moves towards the exit when nascent peptide gets elongated. We have revealed two major aspects. Firstly, Onc 112 greatly accelerates rejection rate of cognate tRNA during aa-tRNA delivery. The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> cognate tRNA {{is similar to the}} <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> successfully accommodated tRNA, which implies that rate of rejection is elevated about an order of magnitude and is approximately the same as the rate of aa-tRNA accommodation (Rodnina and Wintermeyer, 2001). Elevated rejection rate of cognate tRNA leads to slow overall elongation rate, which would significantly hinder growth and survival of cells. Secondly, Onc 112 gradually deactivates translating ribosomes in the early elongation cycles. About ~ 70 % of ribosomes are active in the second elongation cycle, which further decrease to ~ 30 % in the eighth elongation cycle. Strong correlation between interaction energy landscape estimated from MD simulation (Fig. S 6) and the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> active ribosomes measured from smFRET assays (Fig.  1 C) supports our model, in which Onc 112 serves as a peptide exit tunnel blocker. Interactions between Onc 112 and the ribosome introduce extra energy cost in the first 6 – 7 elongation cycles, which reduce elongation rates and gradually deactivate ~ 70 % of ribosomes. The model we proposed here could represent conserved mechanism of action used by many other PrAMPs (Gagnon et al., 2016), which also provides guide to design and optimize future antibiotic drugs.|$|R

In many operational contexts it might be even more relevant to assess whether {{and to what extent}} voluntary visual ocular control is affected by sleepiness due to sleep deprivation and time-of-day effects. In this study we evaluated, in a laboratory simulation of a sudden inversion of the sleep–wake cycle, the nocturnal modifications of smooth pursuit (SP) and saccadic (SAC) eye movements as possible indicators of sleepiness. Levels of sleepiness were objectively measured by means of MSLT and Mainteinance of Wakefulness Test (MWT); subjective ratings of sleepiness were also obtained. After a diurnal sleep, five subjects underwent four nocturnal test sessions, each one comprising an SP and a SAC trial. Both the SP variables considered (velocity gain and phase) showed a trend similar to that one of MWT latencies, being significantly impaired only in the last nocturnal trial, when levels of sleepiness were maximal. Saccadic accuracy showed the same trend, being negatively affected by sleepiness only in the last nocturnal session. In addition, <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> (inappropriate) saccades showed a linear increase during the night, paralleling the shortening of sleep latency at MSLT and the linear increase of subjective ratings of sleepiness.

In this case, the calculation and allocation of dimensional and geometric tolerances is particularly difficult. In fact, with common GT&D method, the single parts are considered as rigid and the functional tolerancing method {{does not take into}} account deformations. The only reference standard is UNI ISO 10579 for flexible assembly. Moreover, its prescriptions are only general indications useful only for dimensional check. In such event, it must be held in consideration also the deformability of every part together with the imposed tolerances and together with the stress level due to the assembly process. This paper proposes a methodology to estimate the combined effects of geometric errors and admissible deformations, for assigning tolerances that ensure the respect of functional requirements of the assemblies. A simple pin-hole connection has been proposed as an example; the case examined is composed of two cylindrical pins and their relative holes. The assessment of multiple effects of geometric tolerances and pin deformations, and the possibility of connections with respect to functional conditions are been investigated.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the degradation kinetics of the major quality attributes in order to better define the shelf life of fresh-cut melons. Melon pieces were stored for eight days in air at 5 °C. Sensorial and physical attributes including colour, external appearance, aroma, translucency, firmness, and chemical constituents, such as soluble solids, fructose, vitamin C, and phenolic content, along with antioxidant activity were monitored. Attributes showing significant changes over time were used to test conventional kinetic models of zero and first order, and Weibullian models. The Weibullian model was the most accurate to describe changes in appearance score, translucency, aroma, firmness and vitamin C (with a regression coefficient always higher than 0. 956), while the other parameters could not be predicted with such accuracy by any of the tested models. Vitamin C showed the lowest kinetic rate among the model parameters, even though at the limit of marketability (appearance score 3), estimated at five days, a loss of 37 % of its initial content was observed compared to the fresh-cut product, indicating a much lower nutritional value. After five days, the aroma score was already 2. 2, suggesting that this quality attribute, together with the vitamin C content, should be taken into account when assessing shelf life of fresh-cut melons. In addition, logistical models were used to fit the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> samples on the basis of non-marketability and non-edibility (appearance score < 3 and < 2, respectively).

40|$|Laboratory {{testing is}} roughly {{divided into three}} phases: a pre-{{analytical}} phase, an analytical phase and a post-analytical phase. Most analytical errors {{have been attributed to}} the analytical phase. However, recent studies have shown that up to 70 % of analytical errors reflect the pre-analytical phase. The pre-analytical phase comprises all processes from the time a laboratory request is made by a physician until the specimen is analyzed at the lab. Generally, the pre-analytical phase includes patient preparation, specimen transportation, specimen collection and storage. In the present study, we report the first comprehensive assessment of the frequency and types of pre-analytical errors at the Sulaimani diagnostic labs in Iraqi Kurdistan. Over 2 months, 5500 venous blood samples were observed in 10 public diagnostic labs of Sulaimani City. The <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> samples and types of sample inappropriateness were evaluated. The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> each of the following pre-analytical errors were recorded: delay in sample transportation, clotted samples, expired reagents, hemolyzed samples, samples not on ice, incorrect sample identification, insufficient sample, tube broken in centrifuge, request procedure errors, sample mix-ups, communication conflicts, misinterpreted orders, lipemic samples, contaminated samples and missed physician's request orders. The difference between the relative frequencies of errors observed in the hospitals considered was tested using a proportional Z test. In particular, the survey aimed to discover whether analytical errors were recorded and examine the types of platforms used in the selected diagnostic labs. The analysis showed a high prevalence of improper sample handling during the pre-analytical phase. In appropriate samples, the percentage error was as high as 39 %. The major reasons for rejection were hemolyzed samples (9 %), incorrect sample identification (8 %) and clotted samples (6 %). Most quality control schemes at Sulaimani hospitals focus only on the analytical phase, and none of the pre-analytical errors were recorded. Interestingly, none of the labs were internationally accredited; therefore, corrective actions are needed at these hospitals to ensure better health outcomes. Internal and External Quality Assessment Schemes (EQAS) for the pre-analytical phase at Sulaimani clinical laboratories should be implemented at public hospitals. Furthermore, lab personnel, particularly phlebotomists, need continuous training on the importance of sample quality to obtain accurate test results...|$|R
40|$|Supply chain {{has become}} more and more {{vulnerable}} to disruption since it is suffering widespread risk issues from inside or outside. Higher uncertainties in the supplier selection problem have gone beyond the traditional cost minimization concern. These uncertainties are related to an ever increasing product variety, more demanding customers, and a highly interconnected distribution network. This paper focuses on the supplier selection problem with disruption risks and mixed uncertainties. A novel multiobjective optimization model with mixed uncertain coefficients is developed, which maximizes the total profits and minimizes the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> items delivered late, <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> items <b>rejected,</b> and total loss cost due to supplier dysfunction. Meanwhile, we also consider the customer demand to be a random fuzzy variable and the unit purchase cost to be a fuzzy variable. By examining a numerical example, we found that the confidence level and demand of customers have impact on the quantities purchased by customers from suppliers although the distribution of suppliers will not change. The cost, quality, and service also influence the selection of suppliers. The superevents have little influence on the distribution of supplier selection; however, when unique event occurs, the distribution of supplier selection will change...|$|R
40|$|Male calves {{from the}} high value parents, bull fathers and bull dams, enter the {{selection}} for artificial insemination. After laboratory tests, the calves are taken to the center for artificial insemination, and after a stay in quarantine the are moved to a test station. At {{the age of twelve}} months they are measured for assessing the value of each calf exterior. One of the measures recorded was the testicle scope. On the basis of testicle size, it is possible to predict sperm production potential. For the determination of testicle size (testicular biometry), tapes or rulers were used. The aim of this work was to investigate the possible effect of testicle size on sperm production in young bulls used for artificial insemination. For that purpose there were used the data on circumference of testicles of one year old bulls just starting production of sperm, and then compared with certain semen quality parameters such as: volume of ejaculate and concentration and <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> alive and progressively mobile spermatozoa. The investigation included all young bulls that started production in the period from 2010. to 2012., that is 36 bulls of various breeds (Simmental, Holstein Friesian, Montafon). After the testicle scope measuring in these bulls, there were observed the parameters of the sperm quality during the following one year period. The obtained results showed that the increased testicle size was followed by the increased average ejaculate quantity, in other words: 3. 7 ml in group of bulls with testicle circumference below 30 cm, to 6. 7 ml in bulls whose testicle circumference was over 40 cm. Also, the results showed that there was a correlation between the increased testicle size and the increased spermatozoa concentration. The values grow to testicle scope of 36 cm, and above that they were still high but with some oscillations. When it came to relation between testicle scope and the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> alive and progressively mobile spermatozoa, the trend line showed their positive correlation. The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> ejaculates varied from 72 % in bulls wit testicle scope below 30 cm to 10 % in bulls with testicle scope above 35 cm. On the basis of the results obtained in this work, the conclusion is that testicle size is an indicator of bull fertility; that there is a significant correlation between testicle size and ejaculate volume, {{and that there is a}} need to explore a genetic link between testicle size and the fertility of their daughters...|$|R
5000|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century was marked with the {{appearance}} of hydraulic forging presses that started to replace hammers at forging works. Forging in forging presses is carried out by two dies of which one makes reciprocal movements and the other one remains stationary. This is the reason for relatively low productivity and high labour intensity of conventional forging in presses. The forging of low-ductility and hard-to-deform steels and alloys by two dies using conventional forging methods is very difficult and sometimes is practically impossible because of high tensile stresses in deformation zone leading to various forging defects and high <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>rejected</b> products.In the 1970s the mechanical radial forging machines (RFM) started to be used for the large-scale production of long-axis forgings where a work piece is reduced in radial directions simultaneously by several pairs of dies. The process of radial forging in mechanical RFM features high productivity of forging. However small single reductions of a work piece restricted by the design of these machines lead to localization of strains mainly in surface zones of the work piece while metal in the core zone remains unworked. [...] In 80-90s hydro-mechanical and hydraulic radial forging machines appeared that do not have the disadvantages inherent to mechanical RFM. Nevertheless, radial forging machines are very specific and very expensive equipment in comparison with multipurpose forging presses. The application of such machines at enterprises {{with a wide range of}} forgings manufactured is economically disadvantageous and inexpedient.The problem of manufacturing long-axis forgings by radial forging method in open-die hydraulic forging presses can be solved with use of multi-die forging devices. First such devices different in design and principle of operation appeared in the 1980s. At present, the most widespread and famous is the four-die forging device of the above described design engineered by Ukrainian and Russian scientists. The four-die forging devices have no analogues in the world now. They are successfully used at works in Russia, Ukraine, Spain, China and Germany.|$|R

Don) timber, {{consisting}} of 150 pieces with dimensions of 80 mmx 120 mmx 2400 mm, 80 pieces with dimensions of 150 mmx 200 mmx 4500 mm, and 75 pieces with dimensions of 150 mmx 250 mmx 5600 mm, were visually graded {{according to the}} Spanish standard UNE 56544 (2011) to analyze the influence or visual grading requirements on both the grading yield and mechanical properties. The resulting <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rejected</b> pieces stood at 19 and 28 % for 150 x 250 mm crooss-section pieces, respectively. That percentage increased to 73 % for 80 x 120 mm cross-section pieces. The grading yield and mechanical properties were then analyzed to {{determine the influence of}} warp defects. Three different criteria for limitng warp defects were considered, bending strength, and density were obtained. The results concluded that loosening specified requisites improves the visual grading output in the smallest cross-section, with no significant reduction in the mechanical properties. A proposal for a less rigorous specification of twist defects in the Spanish visual grading standard has been introduced...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{the present}} study a banana, {{strawberry}} and juçara smoothie was developed using an experimental mixture design. The juçara proportion was kept constant while the banana:strawberry ratio varied and the main responses were the sensory acceptability and the antioxidant capacity. From five formulations, only {{the one with the}} highest <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> strawberry was <b>rejected,</b> most likely due to its lower sugar content and higher acidity. In general, panelists chose the sweeter formulations, which were those with a higher <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> banana. Relating to the consistency, the best formulation was the one containing the same proportion of strawberry and banana pulp, which provided a better flow to the product. Additionally, this sample showed intermediate values of phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity, as well as desirable physicochemical characteristics. In spite of being possible to obtain four formulations with good sensory acceptance, the one with equal amounts of banana and strawberry pulp is highlighted due to its antioxidant capacity and sensory characteristics, statistically corroborated by the desirability function...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, there has been a call for further research to trace the effects of the speedy changes in business environment on management accounting practices. This study assesses the impact of different information technologies on ABC adoption and implementation. It uses a cross-sectional survey of financial directors and controllers in the UK firms. Postal and electronic questionnaires have been used in order to collect the empirical data. The findings revealed that the rate of ABC adoption has shown a number of changes between 1999 and 2005. The proportions of ABC users and those currently assessing it have dramatically fallen. The <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> firms <b>rejecting</b> ABC has slightly fallen as well. However, there has been a considerable {{increase in the number of}} firms that abandoned ABC implementation and those firms that gave no consideration for its implementation. These results indicate a decrease in the popularity of ABC. ERP systems seem to have a slightly low significant impact on the initial decision of ABC adoption in those firms that do not have any consideration for ABC and firms that have an ER...|$|R

A Gallup poll reported that the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> {{people in the}} US who believe in a strict interpretation of creationism had fallen to 40% in 2010 after a high of 46% in 2006. The highest the percentage has risen between 1982 and 2010 was 47% in 1994 and 2000 according to the report. The report found that Americans who are less educated {{are more likely to}} hold a creationist view while those with a college education are more likely to hold a view involving evolution. 47% of those with no more than a high school education believe in creationism while 22% of those with a post graduate education hold that view. The poll also found that church attendance dramatically increased adherence to a strict creationist view (22% {{for those who do not}} attend church, 60% for those who attend weekly). The higher <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> Republicans who identified with a creationist view is described as evidence of the strong relationship between religion and politics in the US. Republicans also attend church weekly more than Democratic or independent voters. Non-Republican voters are twice as likely to hold a nontheistic view of evolution than Republican voters.|$|R
