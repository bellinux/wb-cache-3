Starting in 1955, he worked for a company called Gradmann und Holler, an {{insurance}} broker company for large businesses. Kiep owned 15 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> in 1982. His involvement with Gradmann und Holler sparked controversy. When Kiep became minister in Lower Saxony in 1976, Volkswagen and other local companies went into business with Gradmann und Holler, creating a possible conflict of interest for the minister. Kiep also served on Volkswagen's board of directors. Kiep denied abusing his power as minister, saying that the deal with Volkswagen had been financially damaging rather than profitable for his company. Due to his successful business ventures, Kiep was considered {{to be one of the}} richest politicians in Germany. In an interview, Kiep told Playboy that he could live well just from the interest from his savings.|$|E

5|$|Denmark's Sterling Airways bought ILG's {{share of}} Norway Airlines in mid July. The {{airlines}} announced a partnership, which also included Transwede. The Wallenberg-controlled NRT owned a 48-percent stake in Sterling and 66 percent of Transwede—the remaining third owned by Sterling. The three airlines applied for concessions {{to operate on}} the capital triangle between Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. SAS held a monopoly on these routes and the airlines intended to capture the leisure market between the capital regions. Both ILG and Sterling were hindered in owning {{more than a third}} of Norway Airlines because of Norwegian corporate legislation. Fokus Bank had gradually become the largest shareholder in Norway Airline and owned 40.6 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> in July 1991. At a shareholders meeting in July, Stein Øxseth was appointed chairman and all non-Norwegian board members were replaced.|$|E

25|$|Volvo's long-time CEO Pehr G. Gyllenhammar saw {{early on}} that Volvo {{was too small to}} survive in the future, and {{attempted}} several times to merge with other manufacturers. Volvo nearly merged with Saab in the late seventies, while in 1978 an aborted affair would have seen the Norwegian state take over 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company.</b> In return, Volvo would receive 200 million SEK and a ten percent concession in the Oseberg oil field. Major institutional actors in Sweden opposed the deal and blocked it. A deal to merge with Renault was blocked in 1993, mainly opposed by a Swedish stockholders' association.|$|E
25|$|With the {{deregulation}} approaching, Maersk looked at other markets {{in which it}} could operate. Maersk determined that the British market was lucrative. Through its joint venture with British Airways, the Plimsoll Line, it bought Birmingham Executive Airways. The Plimsoll Line had previously bought Plymouth-based Brymon Airways and also owned Plymouth City Airport. The rules at the time hindered Maersk from owning more than fifty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company.</b> Birmingham Executive Airways was of particular interest for Maersk as they held concessions from Birmingham Airport to Copenhagen, Göteborg Landvetter Airport and Milano. This would allow Maersk to establish itself with additional international routes.|$|E

The following spring the airline established its second route, from Stord to Stavanger Airport, Sola. The same year it bid for offering air ambulance services for the National Air Ambulance Service using Super King Airs, but the bid was unsuccessful. By 1992, Jon Furdal had bought all the shares in the airline. However, he chose to sell ninety <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> to Gregor Nysæter {{at the end of}} the year.|$|E
25|$|The Donnay {{family still}} {{controlled}} 55 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> {{when it went}} bankrupt in 1988. The Walloon and Belgian governments held the remaining shares. The company was acquired {{by a group of}} investors, led by Bernard Tapie with a 51 percent stake, the Walloon government with 29 percent and Albert Frere with 20 percent. In 1991 Tapie sold his 58 percent stake in the company to the Walloon government for $16.2 million in order to finance the acquisition of Adidas shares. The government sold the factory to an Italian sports equipment manufacturer, Carbon Valley, and retained the brand rights. In December 1992 the Walloon government took ownership of the company in order to prevent it from entering administration again.|$|E
25|$|The {{company had}} {{a deficit of}} 6.5 million kroner in 1986. After having lost 10 million kroner of its investment, Tenvig decided to {{withdraw}} from the airline and closed it down in April 1987. However, seventy <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> was bought by Helikopter Service. The airline started operations again in August, legally as a new company, Nye Partnair A/S. It soon reverted to the former name. After about a year the company was again running without a deficit and Helikopter Service sold its shares to the brothers Terje and Rolf Thoresen. From then the company started losing money and had a poor financial result in 1988. That year the airline operated three Convairs and six Super King Airs. In terms of revenue, it was the fifth-largest airline in Norway, with 80 employees.|$|E

25|$|By December 1978, {{one of the}} cornerstones, Tandberg, {{filed for}} bankruptcy. The company was split up and Norsk Data {{became one of the}} shareholders, {{although}} the computer division, Tandberg Data, was spun off. In April 1979 Norsk Data agreed to take over Tandberg's training materials' division and its facilities at Skullerud in Oslo, which would give ample space for expansion. However, Parliament decided in May that they wanted Tandberg to continue operations in the same scale, and offered a NOK105-million subsidy and a large discount in the Skullerud facility to Norsk Data if they took over all of Tandberg. ND accepted the deal and paid NOK12 million for 92 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company,</b> the last part being owned by the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway. Tandberg saw a NOK13-million loss of a NOK130 million revenue in 1979, which were consolidated into Norsk Data's accounts. Not until a February 1980 deal with Mobil secured a NOK25-million advance did the company stop being a burden.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Carnegie {{decided to}} stop relying solely on his company's own {{furnaces}} for coke, and began seeking to buy the fuel on the open market. Thomas and Henry Phipps had alerted Andrew {{to the need for}} a greater and steadier supply for coke for the growing steel works. In 1881, Andrew sent Thomas to meet with Henry Clay Frick, owner of H.C. Frick & Co.—the largest coke producing company in the U.S. Thomas' goal was to induce Frick to buy the Carnegie coke ovens. In November 1881, Thomas proposed selling the Monastery Coke Works near Latrobe, Pennsylvania, to Frick, or at least have Frick take over the marketing and selling of the coke produced there. Thomas' offer came as Frick was planning his wedding, and it fell to Andrew to meet with Frick and his new bride as they honeymooned in New York City. By this time, Thomas had negotiated most of an agreement with Frick, as well as planned the meeting with Andrew. Carnegie took a 10 percent interest in H.C. Frick & Co., Frick took a 50 percent interest in the Monastery coke works, and H.C. Frick & Co. would become the exclusive supplier of coke to Carnegie Bros. & Co. and the Edgar Thomson Steel Works. Thomas was assigned to negotiate the price of coke on an annual basis with Frick, and {{over the next two years}} H.C. Frick & Co. made a 23 percent profit on the coke sold. By 1885, Andrew Carnegie had purchased enough stock in H.C. Frick & Co. to own 50 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company.</b> Frick now attempted to buy into the Carnegie steel companies by selling 12 of the remaining 16 percent of the H.C. Frick which he still owned, but Thomas warned him not to try and to instead seek a position as a manager within the company.|$|E
