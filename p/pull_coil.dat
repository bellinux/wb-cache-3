40|$|Although much {{research}} has been undertaken on the rate of tooth movement, with different hypotheses having been put forward, the concepts of threshold, light, heavy and optimal forces are not still clear. It has been stressed that an ideal orthodontic spring should {{have the ability to}} release a constant force throughout the entire range of its activation, but using traditional techniques applied initial force will decrease, depending on its deactivation due to the tooth movement and the physical properties of the force delivery system. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the clinical use of a new and original spring, the drum spring (DS) retractor (developed in 1992), which applies a constant and continuous force without the need for reactivation, and to compare the effect of a constant and continuous force versus a continuous but diminishing force produced by a traditional <b>pull</b> <b>coil</b> (PC) retractor system on the rate of upper canine retraction. The clinical sample consisted of 15 patients with upper first premolar extractions. For each patient, the upper right canine was retracted by using a DS retractor applying a constant and continuous force of 50 g; the upper left canine was fitted with a conventional PC applying an initial force of 50 g, diminishing proportionally with the distal movement of the canine. In addition, each group was divided according to the age of each patient: eight patients (three males, five females) between 11. 8 and 14. 4 years of age (mean 13 ± 1. 2 years) represented the adolescent group, and seven patients (three males, four females) between 18. 8 and 21. 6 years of age (mean 18. 2 ± 1. 9 years) representing the adult group. The experimental period started 1 week after the extraction of the first premolars. During this period no archwire was used, to avoid friction and force level changes, and the both springs were attached to a 6 mm hook fixed on the canine bracket to reduce tipping. The PC retractor was reactivated every 3 weeks whereas the DS retractor was left untouched over the entire experimental period. The study was continued until one of the two canines was completely retracted. The DS retractor was successful for space closure without any reactivation, and the continuous and constant force provided a more rapid canine movement than the continuous but diminishing force. Canine retraction occurred faster in adolescents than in adults. An entire field of clinical and research applications may be influenced by this new type of sprin...|$|E

50|$|The {{main engine}} of a coiled tubing {{intervention}} is the injector head. This component contains the mechanism to push and <b>pull</b> the <b>coil</b> {{in and out}} of the hole. An injector head has a curved guide beam on top called a gooseneck which threads the coil into the injector body. Below the injector is the stripper, which contains rubber pack off elements providing a seal around the tubing to isolate the well's pressure.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{measurements}} on the superconducting cavity maser (SCM) oscillator show frequency stability of parts in 10 exp 15 for times from 1 to 1000 sec. Phase noise of approximately - 80 dB/f-cubed was also measured. This short- and mid-term performance {{is believed to}} be better than that of any known microwave oscillator. In particular, stability at a measuring time of 1 sec is 10 times better than that of a hydrogen maser, and phase noise at 8 GHz is more than 20 dB below that of the best multiplied quartz crystal oscillators. Substantial technical improvements have been made to eliminate frequency instability due to operational parameters. They are temperature, pump frequency, pump power, pump frequency polarization, temperature gradient, coupling strength, and output VSWR. Either the parameter was stabilized or the coefficient which couples the parameter to the operating frequency was minimized. A frequency <b>pulling</b> <b>coil</b> has been implemented and tested to enable the SCM to be slaved to a hydrogen maser with a time constant of approximately 50 sec. This combination would allow the excellent long term performance of the hydrogen maser to be improved by the newly available short term performance of the SCM...|$|R

50|$|Straight coiling, or the {{practice}} of coiling a cable {{in the same direction}} coil after coil, has the similar result to coiling cable on a spool. If the cable comes off the spool the same way it goes on, the internal 'lay' is preserved, and the cable isn't damaged or twisted internally. If a cable is straight <b>coiled</b> and then <b>pulled</b> from the <b>coil,</b> it has the effect as coiling cable on a spool and then pulling the cable {{off the top of the}} spool, imparting a twist in the cable with every coil that is removed. To make it lie flat, the twist will need to be removed. The advantages of straight coiling cable are that it will not produce knots when uncoiling and is easily taught and therefore can be accomplished easily by assistance.|$|R
40|$|The Remote Field Eddy Current (RFEC) {{technique}} {{is ideal for}} inspecting unpiggable pipelines because all its components can be made {{much smaller than the}} diameter of the pipe to be inspected. We reviewed the technique, and used demonstrations from prior work by others in presentations on the technique and how we plan to develop it. Coils were wound; a jig for <b>pulling</b> the <b>coils</b> through the pipe was manufactured; defects were machined in one six-inch diameter, ten-foot long pipe; and the equipment was assembled. After completing first crude pullout test to show that RFEC inspection would work, we repeated the experiment with a proper jig and got excellent results. The test showed the expected behavior, with the direct field dominating the signal to about two pipe diameters from the drive coil, and the remote field dominating for greater separations between the drive coil and the sensing coils. Response of RFEC to a typical defect was measured, as was the sensitivity to defect size. Before manufacturing defects in the pipe, we measured the effect of defect separation and concluded that defects separated by 18 inches or 1 / 3 rd of the pipe diameter did not interfere with each other. We manufactured a set of 13 defects, and measured the RFEC signals. We found a background variation that was eventually attributed to permeability variations in the seamless pipe. We scanned all thirteen defects and got satisfactory results. The two smallest defects did not show a signal, but these were much too small to be reported in a pipeline inspection. We acquired a ten-foot seam welded pipe that has much less background variation. We are measuring the sensitivity of RFEC signals to mechanical variations between the exciter and sensing coils...|$|R
