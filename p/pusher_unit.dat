50|$|The Tupolev MTB-1 (known {{originally}} as the MDR-4 and internally to Tupolev as the ANT-27) was {{a patrol}} flying boat {{built in the}} Soviet Union in the mid-1930s. It was a refined version of the unsuccessful Chetverikov MDR-3. The revised design retained the MDR-3's hull, but added a newly designed, full-cantilever wing, a new tail, and a new engine installation featuring two tractor and one <b>pusher</b> <b>unit.</b> Trials began in March 1934 but the prototype was destroyed during one takeoff.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} new {{conjugated}} polymers using dihydroindeno[2, 1 -a]indene moiety (ININE), electron-pushing unit with high planarity, for the organic solar cells (OSCs). Pull-push mode of conjugated polymers, P 1 and P 2, containing electron pulling unit of N-alkyl- 2, 2 ′-bithiophene- 3, 3 ′-dicarboximide (BTI) and electron-pushing unit of ININE were synthesized for the broader absorption {{of the solar}} radiation.

40|$|Unplanned {{releases}} of radioactive and hazardous wastes have {{occurred at the}} 241 -SX Tank Farm on the U. S. Department of Energy Hanford Site in southeast Washington State. Interim and long-term mitigation efforts are currently under evaluation for 241 -SX Tank Farm. Two contiguous interim surface barriers have been designed for deployment at 241 -SX Tank Farm to reduce future moisture infiltration; however, construction of the surface barriers has been deferred to allow testing of alternative technologies for soil moisture reduction and possibly contaminant source term reduction. Previous tests performed by other organizations at the Hanford Site have demonstrated that: vadose zone desiccation using large diameter (greater than 4 inch) boreholes is feasible; under certain circumstances, mobile contaminants may be removed in addition to water vapor; and small diameter (approximately 2 inch) boreholes (such as those placed by the direct push hydraulic hammer) {{can be used to}} perform vapor extractions. Evaluation of the previous work combined with laboratory test results have led to the design of a field proof-of-principle test to remove water and possibly mobile contaminants at greater depths, using small boreholes placed with the direct <b>push</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|R
40|$|As much as {{one million}} gallons of waste is {{believed}} to have leaked from tanks, pipelines or other equipment in the single-shell tank farm waste management areas (WMAs) within the 200 East and West areas of the U. S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site near Richland, Washington. Although some contamination has reached groundwater, most contamination still resides in the vadose zone. The magnitude ofthis problem requires new approaches for soil characterization if we are to understand {{the nature and extent of}} the contamination and take action to protect the enviromnent. Because of the complexity and expense of drilling traditional boreholes in contaminated soil, direct push characterization using a hydraulic hammer has been extensively employed. Direct push probe holes < 3 -inch diameter have been pushed to a maximum depth of 240 feet below ground surface in 200 East area. Previously gross gamma and moisture logging of these narrow probe holes was perfonned to identify the location of cesium- 137 ({sup 137 }Cs) (which has limited mobility in Hanford soil) and moisture peaks. Recently a bismuth germinate detector has been deployed for detecting and quantifying the spectrum of cobalt- 60 ({sup 60 }Co) (a more mobile contaminant), which provides additional information. The direct push system is configured to allow the collection ofmultiple soil core samples throughout the depth ofthe probe hole. The direct <b>push</b> <b>unit</b> has been used to place individual electrodes at a variety of depths as the probe hole is being decommissioned. These deep electrodes enable the use of soil resistivity measurement methods between surface and deep electrodes as-well-as between sets of deep electrodes. Initial testing of surface-to-deep electrode resistivity measurements in WMA C demonstrated significant improvement in defining the three dimensional extent of a contamination plume. A multiple-electrode string is presently being developed to further enhance the resolution of resistivity data. The combined use of direct push logging/sampling and soil resistivity measurement allows more extensive characterization of the large tank farm WMAs with less cost and time commitment than required by traditional methods. An additional tool is in the laboratory testing stage to support these investigations. A beta detection tool is being evaluated to determine if it might be deployed with the direct <b>push</b> <b>unit</b> to identify technetium- 99 ({sup 99 }Tc) contamination. {sup 99 }Tc is a mobile, long-lived contaminant that is the major risk driver from tank waste contamination. A screening tool to locate {sup 99 }Tc contamination is anticipated to further increase the cost-effectiveness ofvadose zone characterization efforts...|$|R
40|$|Conjugated {{polymers}} using 6 -(2 -thienyl) - 4 H-thieno[3, 2 -b]indole (TTI) and isoindigo (ID) were synthesized {{and applied}} to the polymer solar cells. TTI as electron <b>pushing</b> <b>unit</b> and ID as electron pulling unit were incorporated in the push-pull types of conjugated polymers (PTTIID, PTTIID- 3, PTTIID- 5 and PTTIID- 7). The alternating copolymer with TTI and ID units was synthesized {{in addition to the}} corresponding random copolymers. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the random copolymers showed red-shifted maximum peaks and wider full width at the half maximum (fwhm) with raising percentages of ID contents. Synthesized polymers shows deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels with increased percentage of ID as electron pulling unit. As compared to the alternating copolymer PTTIID, the random copolymer PTTIID- 7 showed higher JSC and FF values caused by the better morphology and decent hole mobility, resulting in higher PCE value. The device comprising PTTIID- 7 and PCBM (1 : 2) with chloronaphthalene (CN) additive showed a VOC of 0. 63 V, a JSC of 12. 3 mA/cm 2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0. 52, giving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4. 03 %. clos...|$|R

40|$|In {{preparation}} {{to fight and}} win the nation's wars, the United States Army {{spends a lot of}} time and money on tactical training. While few doubt that the Army produces some of the world's finest tactical units, there is still room for improvement. The Army's current tactical evaluation process utilizes a series of subjective and uncalibrated metrics that describe the capability of military units. Leaders fail to see the value in the provided evaluation forms and formats and have begun developing alternative methods to evaluate and provide feedback to their units. The abandonment of a standard evaluation process has added to the inability to objectively or accurately compare units across formations and time. The current evaluation system depends almost entirely on one set of humans to monitor safety, performance, and provide feedback to the training unit for improvement. Humans in this system fatigue and fall prey to natural pressures to reduce standards and <b>push</b> <b>units</b> through training exercises regardless of undesirable performance. Additionally, internal pressure, organizational structure, and competition encourage units to exaggerate or inflate their tactical readiness reports. While this situation is widely recognized in the Army, the current evaluation system results in unreliable, and possibly inaccurate, outputs that are unusable for decision making. As a consequence of this system, the Army maintains very few ways to distinguish between the training levels and capability of tactical units. By examining the organizational structure, individual and unit incentives, and evaluation methods available for the Army to adjust, this document provides a method to compare and evaluate the possible alternatives. by John D.
