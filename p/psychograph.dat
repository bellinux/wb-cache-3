2500|$|In May 1927 his sister, Maria Xavier, {{was having}} mental disturbances, which many {{believed}} {{was caused by}} spiritual sources known as obsession (Spiritism). This episode allowed Francisco to support his sister with his mediumship capacities and {{introduced him to the}} Spiritism Doctrine as well. Simultaneously he allegedly received a new message from his mother in which she recommended him to accomplish all his duties and thoroughly study the books of Allan Kardec; In June; Francisco founded the Spiritist Center Luiz Gonzaga, (spiritist church) in a wooden warehouse owned by his brother. In July, under the guidance of a so-called [...] "benevolent spirit", he started to <b>psychograph,</b> writing seventeen pages.|$|E
2500|$|He became {{widely known}} in Brazil in 1931, when he {{published}} the book Parnassus Beyond the Tomb (...) , which had 259 poems allegedly composed by 56 deceased Brazilian and Portuguese illustrious Poets.That year {{was marked by}} the medium's [...] "adulthood" [...] and when he firstly met his spiritual Mentor Emmanuel, [...] "Under a tree, near a water reservoir..." [...] (SOUTO MAIOR, 1995:31). According to Chico his Mentor informed about his mission to <b>psychograph</b> a sequence of thirty books and to achieve such a task he would require 3 mandatory conditions: [...] "discipline, discipline and discipline". Emmanuel instructed him to be loyal to Jesus and Kardec, {{even if it was}} against his religious basis. Later on, the Medium found out that Emmanuel had been the Roman senator Publius Lentulus, further reborn as a slave who sympathized with Christianity, still in another reincarnation, had been a Jesuit priest Manuel da Nóbrega, involved with the gospel teachings during the colonial period of Brazil in the 18th century.|$|E
6000|$|Two of {{the bravest}} champions whom Spiritualism has ever produced, the late W. T. Stead {{and the late}} Archdeacon Colley--names which will bulk large in days to come--attached great {{importance}} to spirit photography as a final and incontestable proof of survival. In his recent work, [...] "Proofs of the Truth of Spiritualism" [...] (Kegan Paul), the eminent botanist, Professor Henslow, has given one case which would really appear to be above criticism. He narrates how the inquirer subjected a sealed packet of plates to the Crewe circle without exposure, endeavoring to get a <b>psychograph.</b> Upon being asked on which plate he desired it, he said [...] "the fifth." [...] Upon this plate being developed, there was found on it {{a copy of a}} passage from the Codex Alexandrinus of the New Testament in the British Museum. Reproductions, both of the original and of the copy, will be found in Professor Henslow's book.|$|E
2500|$|At that time, Chico Xavier met {{the young}} student of Medicine and medium Waldo Vieira; {{together}} they <b>psychographed</b> several books; until their abruption some years later. In 1959, Francisco moved to Uberaba, {{where he lived}} {{until the end of}} his days. He continued <b>psychographing</b> several books, approaching topics that were priority in the 60's; such as, sex, drugs, youth issues, technology, space travels among others. Uberaba then, became an informal center of pilgrimage, with thousands of people arriving every day; people hoping to make contact with deceased relatives. At that time; books of [...] "messages" [...] became popular; letters dictated by spirits of regular people to their family members; proceeding as well with constant campaigns of food and clothing distribution to the poor people around the town.|$|R
2500|$|Manchete {{magazine}} proceeded saying: [...] "According to the newspapers, he is {{the first}} one to have admitted that the 380 books he had produced were by 'ghost-writers', [...] "literally ghosts'", concluding that; Chico simply transcribes <b>psychographed</b> books through more than 500 deceased and buried writers and poets.|$|R
50|$|The film is an {{adaptation}} of the 1944 book of the same name, said to be dictated by the spirit Andre Luiz and <b>psychographed</b> by Chico Xavier, Brazil's best-known and respected medium, having channeled more than 400 books. The book is considered a great classic of spiritist literature. Engaging the reader from a first-person narrative, Andre Luiz delivers his impressions of the spirit world he encounters after his death.|$|R
60|$|But, if each {{of these}} bare facts could be parted from the others and {{intelligently}} presented, what would it avail with the reader who has never seen the originals of my <b>psychograph?</b> It is from some such question, and not from want of a hospitable will, that I hesitate {{to ask him to}} go with me on a golden morning of March and spend it in the Villa Medici on the Pincian Hill. If I could I should like to pour its yellowness and mellowness round him, perfumed with a potpourri of associations from the time of Lucullus down through every mediaeval and modern time to that very day, when I knew Carolus Duran to be living somewhere in these beauteous bounds {{as the head of the}} French Academy which has its home in them. The academic garden-paths, with a few happy people wandering between their correctly balanced passages of box; the blond facade of the casino looking down with its statues and reliefs on these parterres; a young girl vanishing up an aisle of the grove beside the garden into whatever dream awaited her youth in the leafy dusk; an old American pair gazing after her from the terrace, with the void of the vanished years aching in their hearts for the Rome that was once young with them: does this represent to the reader an appreciable morning in the Villa Medici? He may be grateful to me if he does, and if he likes. I cannot do more for him without doing less, and yet I know it is a palette rather than a picture I am giving him.|$|E
6000|$|The general {{impression}} of the other marbles of the Capitoline Museum remains a composite of standing, sitting, stooping, and leaning figures, of urns and vases, of sarcophaguses and bas-reliefs. If you can be definite about some such delightful presence as that old River dozing over his fountain in the little cold court you see first and last as you come and go, {{it is more than}} your reader, if he is as wise as you wish him, can ask of you. I have been wondering whether he could profitably ask of me some record of my experiences in the official and scientific company with which I was honored that day at the Campidoglio; but I should have to offer him again a sort of composite <b>psychograph</b> of objects printed one upon another and hardly separable in their succession. There would be the figure of Marcus Aurelius, commanding us with outstretched arm {{from the back of the}} bronze charger which would not obey Michelangelo when he bade it [...] "Go," [...] not because it was not lifelike, but because it was too fat to move. Against the afternoon sky, looking down into the piazza with dreamy unconcern from their vantage would be the statues on the balustrated roof of the museum. There would be the sense, rather than the vision, of the white shoulders of Castor and Pollux beside their steeds above the dark-green garden spaces on either hand; there would be the front of the Church of Ara Coeli visible beyond the insignificance of Rienzi's monument; and filling in the other end of the piazza which Michelangelo imagined, and not the Romans knew, there would be the palace of the senator, to which the mayor and the common council of modern Rome now mount by a double stairway, and presumably meet at the top in proceeding to their municipal labors. Facing the museum would be the palace of the Conservatori, where in the noblest of its splendid halls the present company would find itself in the carved and gilded arm-chairs of the conservators, seated at an afternoon tea-table and restoring itself from the fatigues of more and more antique art in the galleries about. After this there would be the gardened court of the palace, with a thin lawn, and a soft little fountain musing in the midst of it, and the sunset light lifting on the wall where the fragments of Septimius Severus's marble map of Rome order themselves in such coherence as archaeology can suggest for them.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>psychograph</b> {{claimed to}} {{mechanically}} discern a subject's aptitudes {{in a number}} of mental faculties. It was designed to measure the person's head according to the principles of phrenology. Lavery patented his first <b>psychograph</b> in 1905 while living in Superior, Wisconsin. Eventually he joined with Frank P. White to form the <b>Psychograph</b> Company, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which operated from 1929 to 1937. They produced a machine which measured the subject's head at 32 points and used those measurements to report the person's supposed mental attributes on a five-point scale ranging from [...] "deficient" [...] to [...] "very superior".|$|E
25|$|Through the decades, Chico {{produced}} {{thousands of}} <b>psychographed</b> letters for desperate parents and mothers {{who came to}} him {{in order to receive}} messages from their deceased sons and daughters. According to a survey from 1990, performed by the Spiritist Medical Association of São Paulo, the letters always contained much informations that was somehow familiar to the readers for whom the letters were intended, and 35 per cent of them carried an identical signature to the signature of the deceased.|$|R
25|$|At that time, {{his fame}} {{extended}} {{to other parts}} of the world, with several books translated into other languages, as well as adaptations for soap operas versions. By the end of 1990, the medium had already <b>psychographed</b> more than four hundreds books. At that time; it was estimated that approximately fifty millions of spiritist books were circulating in Brazil, from which; fifteen million of them were attributed to Chico Xavier and twelve millions to Kardec (SANTOS, 1997:89).|$|R

50|$|The {{partners}} {{had some}} initial success in selling or leasing out the <b>psychograph.</b> The machines were sometimes installed in theater lobbies or department stores as novelty items for customers to use. The {{popularity of the}} device helped maintain interest in phrenology in America well into the 1930s. In the late 1930s the <b>psychograph</b> was withdrawn from the market due to falling sales and increased skepticism from the public.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Psychograph</b> was a phrenology machine, invented {{and marketed}} by Henry C. Lavery {{in the early}} part of the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|During 1930, the {{publishing}} of the romances attributed to Emmanuel {{and the book}} Brasil, Coração do Mundo, Pátria do Evangelho, attributed {{to the spirit of}} Humberto de Campos were highlighted; in which the story of Brazil is interpreted in a mythical and theological way. As consequence; the last book mentioned here brought him a lawsuit from the widow of Humberto de Campos, who pleaded for the <b>psychographed</b> books copyrights, in case the legitimacy of the famous author from Maranhão (A state of Brazil) was proven.|$|R
2500|$|A very {{remarkable}} psychography which circulated worldwide, {{was about}} a case from [...] "Goiania" [...] (a Brazilian city), in which José Divino Nunes, accused of murdering his best friend Maurício Henriques, was cleared from the accusation by a judge who accepted the psychography as a valid proof (among other proofs presented by the defense); a testimony from the victim himself already dead, through a <b>psychographed</b> letter dictated to Chico Xavier. The case took place in October 1979, {{in the city of}} Goiânia, Goiás. Thus; the supposed spirit of Maurício, freed his best friend from the accusation of murder claiming that it had been an accident.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, the American tabloid National Examiner {{published}} an article saying, [...] "Ghost writers make novelist a millionaire" [...] The article was vaunted in Brazil by the extinct news magazine; revista Manchete, titled as Secretary of Ghosts, where it said that, according to National Examiner information; the Brazilian medium had made twenty million dollars as a [...] "Secretary of Ghosts".Manchete magazine proceeded saying: [...] "According to the newspapers, {{he is the first}} one to have admitted that the 380 books he had produced were by 'ghost-writers', [...] "literally ghosts'", concluding that; Chico simply transcribes <b>psychographed</b> books through more than 500 deceased and buried writers and poets.|$|R
5000|$|There is a <b>psychograph</b> {{on display}} at the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices, located at the Science Museum of Minnesota. Visitors to the museum can [...] "have their heads examined" [...] with the machine.|$|E
50|$|Several devices {{similar to}} Keeler's {{polygraph}} version included the Berkeley <b>Psychograph,</b> a blood pressure-pulse-respiration recorder developed by C. D.

50|$|Wagenknecht {{received}} his Ph.D. from the University of Washington in 1932. His doctoral dissertation was a Bradford-like <b>psychograph,</b> Charles Dickens: A Victorian Portrait. In {{the same year}} when he was awarded his Ph.D., Wagenknecht married Dorothy Arnold; the couple had three sons.|$|E
2500|$|His first books, Parnaso de Além-Túmulo, {{containing}} 256 poems {{attributed to}} deceased poets, among them, two being the Portuguese João de Deus, Antero de Quental and Guerra Junqueiro and the Brazilians Olavo Bilac, Cruz e Sousa e Augusto dos Anjos, was published {{for the first}} time in 1932; the book caused strong admiration and controversy among the literary circle from that time. [...] Among other books, Nosso Lar was the one with the largest circulation, it was first published in 1944, which sold more than two million copies, attributed to the spirit of André Luiz, it was the first volume out of a collection composed by seventeen books, all of them <b>psychographed</b> by Chico Xavier, some of them in partnership with medium Doctor Waldo Vieira.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{increasing}} interest in pathological and non-pathological dissociation, few researchers {{have focused on}} the spiritual experiences involving dissociative states such as mediumship, in which an individual (the medium) claims to be in communication with, or under the control of, the mind of a deceased person. Our preliminary study investigated psychography - in which allegedly "the spirit writes through the medium's hand" - for potential associations with specific alterations in cerebral activity. We examined ten healthy psychographers - five less expert mediums and five with substantial experience, ranging from 15 to 47 years of automatic writing and 2 to 18 psychographies per month - using single photon emission computed tomography to scan activity as subjects were writing, in both dissociative trance and non-trance states. The complexity of the original written content they produced was analyzed for each individual and for the sample as a whole. The experienced psychographers showed lower levels of activity in the left culmen, left hippocampus, left inferior occipital gyrus, left anterior cingulate, right superior temporal gyrus and right precentral gyrus during psychography compared to their normal (non-trance) writing. The average complexity scores for <b>psychographed</b> content were higher than those for control writing, for both the whole sample and for experienced mediums. The fact that subjects produced complex content in a trance dissociative state suggests they were not merely relaxed, and relaxation seems an unlikely explanation for the underactivation of brain areas specifically related to the cognitive processing being carried out. This finding deserves further investigation both in terms of replication and explanatory hypotheses...|$|R

50|$|The {{process of}} job {{analysis}} involves the analyst describing {{the duties of}} the incumbent, then the nature and conditions of work, and finally some basic qualifications. After this, the job analyst has completed a form called a job <b>psychograph,</b> which displays the mental requirements of the job. The measure of a sound job analysis is a valid task list. This list contains the functional or duty areas of a position, the related tasks, and the basic training recommendations. Subject matter experts (incumbents) and supervisors for the position being analyzed need to validate this final list in order to validate the job analysis.|$|E
