40|$|Operation of gloveboxes {{containing}} radiological hazards {{relies on}} risks being broadly acceptable. The operator's protection is maintained {{in the event}} of damage to the containment wall or gloves by Vortex Amplifiers (VA's). The VA is a hybrid of the vortex diode and the proportional beam deflection amplifier; two fluidic devices relying on fluid momentum (rather than internal moving parts) to control flow. Further, environmental and fire protection is afforded by inerting the internal glovebox atmosphere utilising Nitrogen or Argon as a constant <b>purging</b> <b>medium.</b> Over the years, ergonomic restrictions have driven VA development towards geometrically scaled-down versions of previously accepted designs. Performance of the new so called mini-VA units was found to be disappointing; investigation of high Oxygen concentrations within gloveboxes identified the mini-VA as being the source. Study of the mini-VA behaviour using smoke visualisation techniques reported here has shown a potential mechanism for leakage from the device control ports into the glovebox. In order to mitigate the leakage and ensure that gloveboxes remain inert and moisture free, increased purging flows are required. The increase in cost of Nitrogen to BNFL is estimated to be in the region of £ 1 000, 000 per year on one plant alone. Very little has been published in respect to back diffusion from VA's or the flow phenomena that cause it. The following work is an experimental and numerical investigation of the physics and characteristic behaviour of mini-V A's, resulting {{in the development of a}} potential retrofit mini-VA solution capable of reducing Oxygen leakage by up to 78...|$|E

High temperature pattern materials are used which can endure experimental high temperature environments while simultaneously having a minimum optical aberration.

40|$|The {{prominence}} of insect cell culture has grown rapidly {{due to its}} ability to produce baculovirus biopesticides and recombinant proteins using the Baculovirus Expression Vector System. A critical problem in the mass production of these products is CO 2 accumulation to inhibitory levels within the bioreactor. The current research investigated the effect of elevated CO 2 concentrations on insect cell growth and metabolism and the roles of oxidative stress and intracellular pH (pHi) in CO 2 inhibition. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf- 9 insect {{cells were cultured in}} a 3 L bioreactor (1. 2 L working volume) controlled at 20 % air saturation, 27 oC and a pH of 6. 2. The cells were exposed to a constant CO 2 concentration by <b>purging</b> the <b>medium</b> with CO 2 and the headspace with air. The experiments were repeated for different CO 2 concentrations and samples were taken every 24 h to determine cell density, viability, metabolism and oxidative stress. The population doubling time (PDT) of Sf- 9 cells increased with increasing CO 2 concentration. Specifically, the PDT for 0 - 37, 73, 147, 183 and 220 mm Hg CO 2 concentrations were 23. 2 ± 6. 7, 32. 4 ± 7. 2, 38. 1 ± 13. 3, 42. 9 ± 5. 4 and 69. 3 ± 35. 9 h (n = 3 or 4; 95 % confidence level), respectively. An 80 mL working volume shaker flask was maintained as a control and had an average PDT of 24. 9 ± 3. 1 h (n = 7; 95 % confidence level). The viability of cells in all experiments was above 90 %. The osmolality for all bioreactor experiments was observed to be 300 - 360 mOsm/kg, a range that is known to have a negligible effect on insect cell culture. Elevated CO 2 concentration did not alter the cell specific glucose consumption rate (2. 5 to 3. 2 x 10 - 17 mol/cell-s), but slightly increased the specific lactate production rate from - 3. 0 x 10 - 19 mol/cell-s to 10. 2 x 10 - 19 mol/cell-s. Oxidative stress did not contribute to CO 2 inhibition in uninfected Sf- 9 cells as no significant increase in the levels of lipid hydroperoxide and protein carbonyl concentrations was discovered at elevated CO 2 concentration. The experiments conducted to determine the effect of CO 2 on pHi were not successful and different experimental methods tested were well documented...|$|R
