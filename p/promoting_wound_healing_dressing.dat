Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to confirm {{the expression of the}} leptin receptor (Ob-R) in human and mouse skin. Leptin was topically administered to chemical wounds created in mouse back skin along with sustained-release absorbable hydrogel. The process of wound repair was histologically observed and the area of ulceration was measured over time. The effect of leptin on the proliferation, differentiation and migration of human epidermal keratinocytes was investigated. Ob-R was expressed in epidermal cells of human and mouse skin. Topical administration of leptin significantly <b>promoted</b> <b>wound</b> <b>healing.</b> Histological analysis showed more blood vessels in the dermal connective tissues in the leptin-treated group. The proliferation, differentiation/function and migration of human epidermal keratinocytes were enhanced by exogenous leptin.

In this study, we demonstrated that expressions of TM and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) were both downregulated in high-glucose cultured human keratinocytes and in skin keratinocytes of diabetic patients. In addition, the wound-triggered upregulation of TM and sTM production was abolished in both high-glucose cultured human keratinocytes and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse skin. Furthermore, supplementation of recombinant sTM could increase TLR 4 expression and <b>promote</b> cutaneous <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> in both high-glucose cultured human keratinocytes and diabetic mice.

Taken together, high-glucose environment reduces the expression of TM and TLR 4 in keratinocytes possibly through the action of TNF-α, and recombinant sTM can increase the TLR 4 expression and <b>promote</b> <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> under diabetic condition...|$|R

40|$|Leptin, a 16 kDa {{circulating}} anti-obesity hormone, exhibits many physiological properties. Recently, leptin {{was isolated}} from saliva; however, its {{function in the}} oral cavity is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the physiological role of leptin in the oral cavity by focusing on its effect on <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> in the oral mucosa. Immunohistochemical {{analysis was used to}} examine the expression of the leptin receptor (Ob-R) in human/rabbit oral mucosa. To investigate the effect of leptin on <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> in the oral mucosa, chemical wounds were created in rabbit oral mucosa, and leptin was topically administered to the wound. The process of wound repair was histologically observed and quantitatively analyzed by measuring the area of ulceration and the duration required for complete healing. The effect of leptin on the proliferation, differentiation and migration of human oral mucosal epithelial cells (RT 7 cells) was investigated using crystal violet staining, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> assay, respectively. Ob-R was expressed in spinous/granular cells in the epithelial tissue and vascular endothelial cells in the subepithelial connective tissue of the oral mucosa. Topical administration of leptin significantly <b>promoted</b> <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> and shortened the duration required for complete healing. Histological analysis of gingival tissue beneath the ulceration showed a denser distribution of blood vessels in the leptin-treated group. Although the proliferation and differentiation of RT 7 cells were not affected by leptin, the migration of these cells was accelerated in the presence of leptin. Topically administered leptin was shown to <b>promote</b> <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> in the oral mucosa by accelerating epithelial cell migration and enhancing angiogenesis around the wounded area.

Therefore, {{we hypothesized that}} estrogen administration in protein-malnourished ovariectomized (OVX) female mice might improve the inflammatory response and <b>promote</b> cutaneous <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> as well as normal nutrition. To test this hypothesis, we used full-thickness excisional wounds in Control SHAM, PM SHAM, PM OVX and PM OVX+ 17 β-estradiol mice. The Control diet included 200 g/kg protein and the PM diet included 30 g/kg protein. The ratio of wound area in the Control SHAM group was significantly smaller {{than those in the}} three PM groups. In addition, microscopic findings also showed that the ratio of collagen fibers, the ratio of myofibroblasts and the number of new blood vessels in the Control SHAM group were significantly greater than those in the three PM groups. However, the number of Ym 1 -positive cells as an anti-inflammatory M 2 -like macrophage marker in the PM OVX+ 17 β-estradiol group was significantly higher than those in the other three groups. These results indicate that the appearance of anti-inflammatory M 2 -like macrophages was promoted by estrogen administration; however, it could not <b>promote</b> cutaneous <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> upon a low-protein diet.
