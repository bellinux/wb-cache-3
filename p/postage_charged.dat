40|$|Postal {{services}} have emerged and existed {{because of the}} need for communication and their millenary existence was achieved due to three elements: the only channel of communication, the state of monopoly conferred by the status of the state institution and therefore no competition. The most important known moments in the history of postal services, which led to reforms are: unification of <b>postage</b> <b>charges,</b> postal stamp appearance and now, liberalization of postal services. The slow development of the postal sector varies from country to country, depending on the state of development of the country and within countries depending on the gap between urban and rural areas. The operation of postal services throughout their existence was and is provided by specific legislation and it should be aligned with international postal legislation, to ensure continuity of information. There can be no country to formulate its own laws or its own organization, without regard to organization and international regulations. Both the specificity and diversity of postal services causes a special approach {{in the context of their}} market and also in the services market context. Postal services are services of general interest, which emerged from communication need, from personal or official needs, not from economic needs. As an alternative to postal {{services have}} emerged and developed rapidly the courier services that come to complete and even compete to this category of services. We proposed in this paper to analyze and compare these two categories of services to determine the advantages and disadvantages but also the degree of which grow together or develop in a continuous competition...|$|R

According to Ralph Allen, in 1741 the value of franked letters, if the correct <b>postage</b> had been <b>charged,</b> was over £50,000 and by the time of Allen's death in 1764 the annual value was £170,000.|$|R
