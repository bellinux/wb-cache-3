Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{said the}} group were poised to succeed [...] "where other X Factor winners have failed by releasing a great single at the right time". Cragg highlighted the song's production, writing that it had [...] "everything you'd want to hear in a pop song in 2012", and likened Little Mix's [...] "ridiculous vocal runs" [...] to those of Christina Aguilera. Tim Lee from musicOMH called it [...] "an absolutely stomping pop song" [...] and [...] "possibly the best mass market pop song since Girls Aloud's heyday", complimenting its brass production and call and response. According to Lee, the track is [...] "all shot through with such sassiness that you nearly forget it sounds {{an awful lot like}} 'Ain't No Other Man' by Christina Aguilera." [...] Joe Rivers of No Ripcord gave the song a rating of nine out of ten, regarding it as [...] "vivacious, fun, brash and confident", and noting its [...] "absolute belter of a chorus".

5000|$|Robert X. Cringely, {{author of}} Accidental Empires and {{creator of the}} documentaries Triumph of the Nerds and Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, argues that [...] "the film is beautifully shot and Kutcher's {{portrayal}} of Jobs, while not spot-on, is <b>pretty</b> <b>darned</b> <b>good.</b> He certainly has the look down and the walk. But Ashton Kutcher also produced this film and he's definitely a better actor than producer. There {{are a lot of}} historical inaccuracies that just don't have to be there. ... The great failing of this film is the same failing as with Walter Isaacson's book: something happened during Steve's NeXT years (which occupy less than 60 seconds of this 122 minute film) that turned Jobs from a brat into a leader, but they don't bother to cover that." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle states that [...] "at its best, it's a good picture, and at its worst, it's almost good." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone suggests that [...] "Kutcher nails the genius and narcissism. It's a quietly dazzling performance" [...] but also notes that [...] "Jobs is a one-man show that needed to go for broke and doesn't. My guess is that Jobs would give it a swat." [...] Contributor for rogerebert.com, Susan Wloszczyna, gave the movie 2/4 stars, saying that, [...] "Rather than attempting a deeper plunge behind the whys and wherefores of the elite business-model gospel according to Apple Inc. guru Steve Jobs and - more importantly - what it says about our culture, the filmmakers follow the easy rise-fall-rise-again blueprint familiar to anyone who has seen an episode of VH1's Behind the Music." [...] She further discusses how Kutcher's performance and the overall movie failed to portray Jobs in iconic manner that current pop culture suggests even after Jobs' passing. In a movie review for The New York Times, writer Manohla Dargis writes that Jobs was [...] "inevitably unsatisfying" [...] and a result of a poor performance of the filmmakers rather than the actors themselves.|$|R

50|$|There’s no {{shortage}} of troops for Baghdad, a place much easier for the Iraqi military to patrol. And many of these troops are actually <b>pretty</b> <b>darn</b> <b>good.</b> I would cite the example of an officer such as Brig. Gen. Nassir al-Hiti of the Muthana Brigade in Abu Ghraib. I would put him up against the best Brig. Gen. in any NATO army, including America’s. But there are certain pockets of Abu Ghraib {{that he is not}} allowed to patrol because the US military has struck deals with local CLC commanders who were active in the Islamic Army or the 1920 Revolution Brigades. Problem is, these CLCs are not, in fact, keeping a tight lid on soft-insurgent actions (...such as lobbing mortars) or organized crime networks as well as Gen. al-Hiti is doing. Why continue subsidizing what’s failing (the ex-insurgents, who can barely stay ahead of Al-Qaeda’s assassins) and not using what’s succeeding (the Iraqi Army)? commented by Nibras Kazimi نبراس الكاظمي a visiting Scholar at the Hudson Institute in Washington DC, and he writes a weekly column on the Middle East for the New York Sun, and a monthly column for the Prospect Magazine (UK).|$|E

Had it been his first effort, I'd have been more forgiving." [...] He singles out for criticism [...] "Conan being presented as a necrophiliac" [...] ("just ... bizarre") and his [...] "ability to speak to everyone ... with seemingly no language gap," [...] and Perry's [...] "really weak spot," [...] "his names." [...] On the plus side, he sees [...] "nothing particularly wrong with Perry's writing style," [...] assessed as [...] "very light with {{a good amount of}} humour in it." [...] The humor is rated favorably in comparison to that in the Conan stories of L.

[...] He reaches two conclusions: [...] "All in all it wasn't a bad story, but it wasn't a great Conan story," [...] and [...] "If it wasn't for the language and sexual overtones I'd say this would have been a <b>pretty</b> <b>darn</b> <b>good</b> Conan Young Adult Novel."
