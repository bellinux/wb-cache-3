30|$|Engaging {{learners}} {{in the design}} of domain-specific experiments/investigations that are knowledge rich and less constrained reveal very different patterns of engagement by children. Such experiences typically require a sequence of lessons over days and perhaps weeks to complete and, importantly, also require the use of prior knowledge. An example, building on the domain general COV activity, is posing a challenge to students to construct a pendulum that can be used as 1  s/period counter or second timer. Here, time measurements from an array of different length pendulums are used to develop a data set. The data set, in turn, is used to build a data structure representation to find which pendulum length has a 1 -s period. Extensions of the lesson could predict and then investigate if different materials (e.g., wooden dowels, metal <b>pipes,</b> and <b>chains)</b> as the same length of the string would produce a 1 -s swinger/pendulum. Domain-specific investigation researches were found to have knowledge rich requirements and demands.|$|R

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} find broad application as {{therapy for}} {{various types of}} cancer by employing multiple mechanisms of action against tumors. Manipulating the Fc-mediated functions of antibodies that engage immune effector cells, such as NK cells, represents a strategy to influence effector cell activation and to enhance antibody potency and potentially efficacy. We developed a novel approach to generate and ascertain the functional attributes of Fc mutant monoclonal antibodies. This entailed coupling single expression vector (pVitro 1) antibody cloning, using polymerase incomplete primer extension (<b>PIPE)</b> polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction, together with simultaneous Fc region point mutagenesis and high yield transient expression in human mammalian cells. Employing this, we engineered wild type, low (N 297 Q, NQ), and high (S 239 D/I 332 E, DE) FcR-binding Fc mutant monoclonal antibody panels recognizing two cancer antigens, HER 2 /neu and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4. Antibodies were generated with universal mutagenic primers applicable to any IgG 1 pVitro 1 constructs, with high mutagenesis and transfection efficiency, in small culture volumes, at high yields and within 12 [*]days from design to purified material. Antibody variants conserved their Fab-mediated recognition of target antigens and their direct anti-proliferative effects against cancer cells. Fc mutations {{had a significant impact}} on antibody interactions with Fc receptors (FcRs) on human NK cells, and consequently on the potency of NK cell activation, quantified by immune complex-mediated calcium mobilization and by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of tumor cells.

40|$|The gold {{market is}} one of the major world markets and the Italian {{companies}} place the country as one of the major players in this sector. However, the production in these companies is mostly based on the use of artisan skills, without investing in research and studies about the production processes of these materials. In fact, often the process depends on a "craft" way of working, in which the technical and scientific knowledge are dictated more by experience than by a systematic scientific approach. The international bibliography regarding the world of machining of gold alloys is not as developed as in the case of other metal alloys (steels and aluminum alloys), in which the aesthetic appearance is much less important than the functional aspect. The increase in the nationally and internationally competitiveness caused a growing interest to the study of these materials and their metallurgical properties, with the need to create more complex products that are able to maintaining their extremely high quality. Many of the metallurgical concepts of other materials (in particular face-centered cubic structure alloys) can be applied to gold alloys. However, the greatest variety in composition, the well-defined standards in form, the mechanical and aesthetic properties that they have to satisfy, made necessary the knowledge of mode and characteristics, with which the different constituents influencing the machining, heat treatments and the final quality of the semi-finished product. In the first part of the thesis, the main properties of pure gold and gold alloys will be presented, with a particular attention to the main jewelry production technologies and the main usage of gold in the world market. In first chapter the supply, demand and pricing of gold will be generally described to allow an easy collocation of the information contained and the results explained in this thesis, in a larger context such as the world gold market. After, in chapter 2, will be described the main features of gold, which make its the most important metal used for the production of precious artifacts. The attention will be focused mainly on the electronic configuration of gold, and on the physical, optical, and crystallographic properties that result from this. In chapter 3, the aim is to introduce the metallurgical principles of alloying for improve particular properties, such as strengthening, or for adjust other characteristics of gold alloys in order to meet certain requirements. Will be introduced the industrial operations of casting, deformation, heat treatment, and interesting using of innovative approaches to the goldsmith production. Chapter 4 is an overview of the main technologies used in gold jewelry manufacture, the aim is to give a more complete idea of the means of the term “jewelry”, and of the key role of a scientific approach, or the scientific research, focused to improve and develop the industrial production system. The second part of this thesis summarizes the work carried out during the three-year Ph. D in Industrial Engineering. The objectives of the project are the determination of the relationships between the composition and different properties of the gold alloys (the caratage, the color, the mechanical properties,…) used by the goldsmith company in the different stage of the production cycle for the realization of full <b>pipe</b> and cable <b>chain.</b> In particular will be studied the effect of the various constituents and their quantity in the alloys, the mechanical properties and the weldability of these. The investigation will be performed from the melting process, through different plastic deformation and annealing steps, until the realization of the welded semi-finished product. A further objective of the project is the study of the mechanisms of plastic deformation of the different alloys used in the company, in order to optimize the processes of deformation and heat treatments depending on the material used, the various alloying elements and the different production cycles. In chapter 5, will be briefly described the experimental apparatus used for the characterization of the samples (taken from the whole production process in the goldsmith company FilK S. p. A.), in the laboratories of the Department of Industrial Engineering of the Padua University. In chapter 6, will be described the production cycle of the gold welding wires used to solder the hollow gold chain produced. The effect of the microstructure and residual stresses on the corrosion and mechanical properties will be discussed. The study will focus on the control of production parameters in order to improve machinability of the gold wires and to increase their properties. In chapter 7, a statistic analysis of some mechanical and compositional characteristics of gold alloy wires will be reported. The purpose is to individuate an approximation of the possible existing influences and relationships between these and the energy absorbed during deformation. The properties that will be investigated are elongation, Young modulus, ultimate strength and the concentration of gold. In Chapter 8, the production processes of gold alloys plates will be described. The aim of this part of thesis is to optimize the microstructure and the mechanical properties of the products, which, successively, will be welded to an iron sheet to create the base for the final hollow chain products. The parameters of production cycles and the intrinsic properties of the different gold alloys will be studied, with particular attention to the stresses and the microstructures generated from the subsequent deformation and annealing steps. Finally, in chapter 9 the plating process will be analyzed, in order to define the influence of the process parameters on the characteristics of the semi-finished products. Furthermore, different ageing treatments for various gold alloy compositions will be described, the results will allow to optimize time and temperature of the age-hardening treatments for the company’s gold alloys. The whole production tests were performed, in collaboration with Ing. Fabrizio Furlan, in Filk S. p. A., the goldsmith company partner of this collaboration and unique supplier of the material for this research. The main part of the characterization of the different gold samples was carried out at the metallurgy laboratories in the Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Padua, under the supervision of prof. Manuele Dabalà and in collaboration with Ing. Luca Pezzato. Some analyzes, especially the chemical etching of the specimens with different solutions of cyanides, have been performed at other structure: in the laboratories of Progold S. p. A. in collaboration with Ing. Daniele Maggian, Dr. Patrizio Sbornicchia and Dr. Valerio Doppio. The obtained results allowed improving the workability of the gold alloys used by the company with a reduction of the industrial wastes. The optimization of the production parameters, in the different processes, allowed to increase the microstructural quality of the semi-finished products with an improvement on the mechanical and metallurgical characteristics. A suitable control on the production processes and, the optimization of the gold alloy’s compositions, allowed to increase the constancy, the reproducibility of the results and the quality in the production of hollow and cable <b>pipe</b> <b>chains.</b> The obtained results also have a scientific relevance that have allowed their presentation in numerous national and international conferences and publication in scientific journals as reported at the end of the thesis. ...|$|R

A vignette: Cleaning Text & Debugging was added to assist users with cleaning and debugging problems in qdap. pronoun_type, and subject_pronoun_type, object_pronoun_type added to examine usage of subject/object pronouns by grouping variable. MINOR FEATURES dplyr's <b>chaining</b> <b>pipe</b> imported for convenience. See [URL] for details. IMPROVEMENTS wfm gains a speedup through generic classes and tm package integration (strip is no longer used in wfm). as. tdm. character and as. dtm. character gain a speed boost with a tm package integration. Added message to as. data. frame. Corpus for missing end-marks suggesting the use of: sent. split = FALSE. as. Corpus familiy of functions didn't necessarily respect document names and sometimes used numeric sequence instead. The introduction of a reader via tm::readTabular has fixed this. sentSplit now gives warnings for text that may contain anomalies such as: non-ASCII characters, factors, missing punctuation, empty cells, and no alphabetic characters found. read. transcript now gives a warning when reading from a. docx file and the separator (sep) used is still found in the text as this may indicate the data did not split correctly. dispersion_plot now takes a named list of vectors of terms as the argument to match. terms. The vectors are combined as a unified theme named with the names of the list supplied to match. terms. CHANGES as. data. frame. Corpus's default value for sent. split is now FALSE.

5|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} between Kane and Gene Snitsky. At Unforgiven, Shawn Michaels defeated Kane in a no disqualification match, a match where neither wrestler can be disqualified, allowing for weapons and outside interference. The next night on Raw, Kane demanded that authority figure Eric Bischoff, a portrayed match-maker and rule-enforcer, {{give him a}} rematch against Michaels, but Bischoff refused to do so as Michaels was preoccupied with appearing in Chris Jericho's interview segment, The Highlight Reel. Bischoff, however, scheduled Kane in a no disqualification match against an opponent of Bischoff's choice. Kane's opponent was revealed to be Gene Snistky. During the match, Kane's scripted wife, Lita, who was pregnant in the storyline, entered the ring. This led to Kane accidentally falling {{on top of her}} after Snitsky hit Kane with a steel chair, ending the match. Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took Lita away in an ambulance for medical attention. The following week, Kane was informed by doctors that Lita suffered a scripted miscarriage following the events of the previous week. On the September 27 episode of Raw, in an interview with Todd Grisham, Kane informed Grisham that he sought revenge against Snitsky for his actions. The following week, Lita gave her first interview since the miscarriage and revealed that she and Kane would get payback against Snitsky. During the same episode, Snitsky was interviewed by Raw commentator Jim Ross and told Ross that the death of the couple's unborn child was not his fault. Kane interrupted the interview segment, but Snitsky attacked Kane with a lead pipe in self-defense. This led Bischoff to announce a Weapon of Choice match for Taboo Tuesday, where fans would be able to vote on whether a lead <b>pipe,</b> a steel <b>chain,</b> or a steel chair would be legal for use in the match.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{invention}} of {{light detection and ranging}} (LIDAR) in the early 1960 s, it has been adopted for use in numerous applications, from topographical mapping with airborne LIDAR platforms to surveying of urban sites with terrestrial LIDAR systems. Static terrestrial LIDAR has become an especially effective tool for surveying, in some cases replacing traditional techniques such as electronic total stations and GPS methods. Current state-of-the-art LIDAR scanners have very fine spatial resolution, generating precise 3 D point cloud data with millimeter accuracy. Therefore, LIDAR data can provide 3 D details of a scene with an unprecedented level of details. However, automated exploitation of LIDAR data is challenging, due to the non-uniform spatial sampling of the point clouds {{as well as to the}} massive volumes of data, which may range from a few million points to hundreds of millions of points depending on the size and complexity of the scene being scanned. ^ This dissertation focuses on addressing these challenges to automatically exploit large LIDAR point clouds of piping systems in industrial sites, such as chemical plants, oil refineries, and steel mills. A complete processing chain is proposed in this work, using raw LIDAR point clouds as input and generating cylinder parameter estimates for pipe segments as the output, which could then be used to produce computer aided design (CAD) models of <b>pipes.</b> The processing <b>chain</b> consists of three stages: (1) segmentation of LIDAR point clouds, (2) detection and identification of piping elements, and (3) cylinder fitting and parameter estimation. The final output of the cylinder fitting stage gives the estimated orientation, position, and radius of each detected pipe element. ^ A robust octree-based split and merge segmentation algorithm is proposed in this dissertation that can efficiently process LIDAR data. Following octree decomposition of the point cloud, graph theory analysis is used during the splitting process to separate points within each octant into components based on spatial connectivity. A series of connectivity criteria (proximity, orientation, and curvature) are developed for the merging process, which exploits contextual information to effectively merge cylindrical segments into complete pipes and planar segments into complete walls. Furthermore, by conducting surface fitting of segments and analyzing their principal curvatures, the proposed segmentation approach is capable of detecting and identifying the piping segments. ^ A novel cylinder fitting technique is proposed to accurately estimate the cylinder parameters for each detected piping segment from the terrestrial LIDAR point cloud. Specifically, the orientation, radius, and position of each piping element must be robustly estimated in the presence of noise. An original formulation has been developed to estimate the cylinder axis orientation using gradient descent optimization of an angular distance cost function. The cost function is based on the concept that surface normals of points in a cylinder point cloud are perpendicular to the cylinder axis. The key contribution of this algorithm is its capability to accurately estimate the cylinder orientation in the presence of noise without requiring a good initial starting point. After estimation of the cylinder 2 ̆ 7 s axis orientation, the radius and position are then estimated in the 2 D space formed from the projection of the 3 D cylinder point cloud onto the plane perpendicular to the cylinder 2 ̆ 7 s axis. With these high quality approximations, a least squares estimation in 3 D is made for the final cylinder parameters. ^ Following cylinder fitting, the estimated parameters of each detected piping segment are used to generate a CAD model of the piping system. The algorithms and techniques in this dissertation form a complete processing chain that can automatically exploit large LIDAR point cloud of piping systems and generate CAD models. ...|$|R
