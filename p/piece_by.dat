5|$|Chief Executive Donald Tsang {{said that}} being overzealous in saving the past may hurt Hong Kong's competitiveness, {{and called on}} activists {{to take a more}} {{balanced}} view toward economic growth and conservation. Soon after Tsang's re-election as Chief Executive, on 26 March, the Government pressed ahead with plans to dismantle and move the entire pier, <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> piece, enabling the reclamation to go ahead.|$|E
5|$|The {{power of}} Clan MacAulay and the fortune of the Lairds of Ardincaple diminished from the 17th century into the 18th century. Successive lairds {{were forced to}} divide and sell, <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> piece, the lands once governed by the clan. As the laird's {{resources}} dried up, their lands fell into decay, and the once expansive lands of Ardincaple shrank to only a few farms.|$|E
5|$|Years after Su's death, {{the capital}} city of Kaifeng was besieged and {{captured}} in 1127 by the Jurchens of the Manchuria-based Jin Dynasty during the Jin–Song wars. The clock-tower was dismantled <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> the Jurchens, who carted its components back to their own capital in modern-day Beijing. However, due to the complexity of the tower, they were unable to successfully piece it back together. The new Emperor Gaozong of Song instructed Su's son, Su Xie, to construct a new astronomical clock-tower in its place, and Su Xie set to work studying his father's texts with a team of other experts. However, they were also unsuccessful in creating another clock tower, and Su Xie was convinced that Su Song had purposefully left out essential components in his written work and diagrams so that others would not steal his ideas.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} {{primary school}} {{in his native}} village, he graduated from {{a high school in}} the Danube port of Brăila, then enrolled at the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy in Bucharest. He was also attending lectures at the Faculty of Chemistry and Physics. Cerna debuted as a poet in 1897, at the age of sixteen, when his Trecutul ("The Past")—an adaptation of a <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> Nikolaus Lenau—was published in George Coşbuc's Foaia Interesantă magazine. His first original poem, Orientale ("Orientals"), saw print two years later in the magazine Carmen.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1880, {{in their}} annual reports, the Mint Director and Treasury Secretary appealed to Congress to {{discontinue}} the three-cent piece. The last three-cent pieces were struck in 1889, and the denomination was discontinued, {{along with the}} gold dollar and the three-dollar <b>piece,</b> <b>by</b> the Act of September 26, 1890. Many of the coins from 1888 and 1889 were still held at the Treasury Department and were melted after passage of the act, the fate of millions more as they flowed back from banks. The resultant metal contributed to large mintages of the Liberty Head nickel between 1890 and 1893.|$|E
5|$|Inn-yard theatres {{were first}} {{established}} in the Tudor period, with the Boar's Head Inn (1557) in Whitechapel, the George in Stepney and a purpose built, but short lived, John Brayne's Red Lion Theatre (1567), nearby. The first permanent theatres with resident companies were constructed in Shoreditch, with James Burbage's The Theatre (1576) and Henry Lanman's Curtain Theatre (1577) standing close together. On the night of 28 December 1598 Burbage's sons dismantled The Theatre, and moved it <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> piece across the Thames to construct the Globe Theatre.|$|E

The original Zeiss-Jena projector was bought as a museum <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> York University for the sum of $1, subsequently dismantled, and placed into storage.

5|$|The Toronto Symphony Orchestra {{was invited}} to perform at the Detroit Masonic Temple {{auditorium}} on November 27, 1951 {{as part of the}} Major Symphony Series, which also featured the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, and the Philadelphia Orchestra. TSO director MacMillan viewed this first-ever US invitation as a golden opportunity to garner more international invitations for the orchestra. He added vocal soloist Lois Marshall to the orchestra, as well as a <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> an American composer, Herbert Elwell's work Pastorale, and Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations, to the repertoire.|$|E
5|$|The sculpture's roughly cubical {{arrangement}} cleverly {{ensures that}} the overall composition retains a harmonious equilibrium. It is lightened by the artist dispensing with a back slab and incorporating negative space into the <b>piece.</b> <b>By</b> putting {{the children in the}} place of Seneb's legs, the artist adds to the sense of symmetry. He creates the same impression that would have been made by an ordinary seated figure, preserving an appearance of normality without disguising Seneb's unusual physique. The family's names and titles are given in inscriptions placed {{on either side of the}} children and on the horizontal face of the base.|$|E

5|$|With no army left {{to defend}} Tigranocerta, and a foreign populace that gleefully opened the gates to the Romans, Lucullus' army began the {{wholesale}} looting and plunder of the city. The city was literally deconstructed <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> piece. The king's treasury, {{estimated to be}} worth 8,000 talents, was looted and each soldier in the army was awarded 800 drachma. The battle also resulted in severe territorial losses: most of the lands in Tigranes' empire {{to the south of}} the Taurus fell under the sway of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Although a Junimist for a {{large part}} of his life, Ion Luca Caragiale himself saw a {{precursor}} in Heliade, and even expressed some sympathy for his political ideals. During the 1890s, he republished a <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> Heliade in the Conservative Party's main journal, Epoca. One of Caragiale's most significant characters, the Transylvanian schoolteacher Marius Chicoş Rostogan, shares many traits with his counterparts in Heliade's stories. Developing his own theory, he claimed that there was a clear difference between, on one hand, the generation of Heliade Rădulescu, Ion Câmpineanu, and Nicolae Bălcescu, and, on the other, the National Liberal establishment formed around Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail Pătârlăgeanu—he identified the latter grouping with hypocrisy, demagogy, and political corruption, while arguing that the former could have found itself best represented by the Conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Balzac's usual mode of {{revision}} involved vast, complicated edits made to galley proofs {{he received}} from the printer. When creating La Cousine Bette, however, he submitted the work to his editor <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> piece, without viewing a single proof. The book was serialized in Le Constitutionnel from 8October to 3December, and Balzac rushed {{to keep up with}} the newspaper's rapid printing schedule. He produced an average of eight pages each day, but was struck by the unexpected enormity of the story as it evolved. Balzac was paid 12,836 francs for the series, which was later published with Le Cousin Pons as a twelve-volume book by Chiendowski and Pétion. The first collected edition of La Cousine Bette was organized into 132 chapters, but these divisions were removed when Balzac added it to his massive collection La Comédie humaine in 1848.|$|E

5|$|Hardee {{regularly}} {{appeared in}} his own shows at the Edinburgh Fringe. The Greatest Show on Legs debuted there in 1982. Arguably his most infamous confirmed stunt there was in 1983 when, performing at The Circuit venue – {{a series of three}} adjoining tents in a construction site with a different show in each tent – he became annoyed by what he regarded as excessive noise emanating nightly from Eric Bogosian's neighbouring performance tent. Hardee obtained a nearby tractor and, entirely naked, drove it across Bogosian's stage during his performance. Rivalling this stunt in Fringe infamy, in 1989, Hardee and Arthur Smith wrote a rave 5-star review of Hardee's own Fringe show and successfully managed to get it printed in The Scotsman under the byline of the influential newspaper's comedy critic. At the Fringe in 1996, The Independent reported that he attempted to sabotage American ventriloquist David Strassman's Edinburgh show by abducting the act's hi-tech dummy, holding it to ransom and sending it back to Strassman <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> piece in return for hard cash. The plan failed.|$|E
5|$|Pinafore {{opened on}} 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique, before an {{enthusiastic}} audience, with Sullivan conducting. Soon, however, the piece suffered from weak ticket sales, generally ascribed to a heat wave {{that made the}} Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable. The historian Michael Ainger questions this explanation, at least in part, stating that the heat waves {{in the summer of}} 1878 were short and transient. By mid-August, Sullivan wrote to his mother that cooler weather had arrived, which was good for the show. In the meantime, the four partners of the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the opera's viability and posted closing notices. Carte publicised the <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> presenting a matinee concert performance on 6 July 1878 at the enormous Crystal Palace.|$|E
5|$|The Independent {{newspaper}} apologised on 21 August 2006, {{writing that}} on 14 June 2006, the paper had wrongly reported Mardas' involvement with Apple Electronics Ltd. They corrected the earlier <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> writing that Mardas {{had not been}} a company employee, but a director and shareholder of Apple Electronics, and was not sacked, but resigned his directorship in May 1971, while still retaining his shareholding, until giving it to Apple Corps some years later. The paper accepted that Mardas “did not claim to have invented electric paint, a flying saucer or a recording studio with a ‘sonic force field’ or cause his employers to waste money on such ideas. We apologise to Mr. Mardas for these errors".|$|E

5|$|The {{love story}} between Berenice and Titus {{is also the}} premise of La clemenza di Tito (1734), an Italian opera with music by Antonio Caldara and a {{libretto}} by Pietro Metastasio that was later set to music by more than 40 other composers, including Johann Adolph Hasse (1735), Giuseppe Arena (1738), Francesco Corradini (1747), Christoph Willibald Gluck (1752), Andrea Adolfati (1753), Niccolò Jommelli (1753), Ignaz Holzbauer (1757), Vincenzo Legrezio Ciampi (1757), Gioacchino Cocchi (1760), Marcello Bernardini (1768), Andrea Bernasconi (1768), Pasquale Anfossi (1769), and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (La clemenza di Tito, 1791). More recently it {{was used as the}} backdrop for the Caroline Lawrence novels the Assassins of Rome and the Enemies of Jupiter. Lindsey Davis mentions it, though without making it the central plot line in novels such as Saturnalia. It is also the stimulus for the new ballet <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> Kim Brandstrup, 'Invitus Invitam' which premiered in the Royal Opera House in October 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{struggle}} changed significantly when Robert the Bruce, Earl of Carrick, killed his rival John Comyn on 10 February 1306 at Greyfriars Kirk in Dumfries. He was crowned king (as Robert I) less than seven weeks later. Robert I battled to restore Scottish Independence as King for over 20 years, beginning by winning Scotland back from the Norman English invaders <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> piece. Victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 proved the Scots had regained control of their kingdom. In 1315, Edward Bruce, brother of the King, was briefly appointed High King of Ireland during an ultimately unsuccessful Scottish invasion of Ireland aimed at strengthening Scotland's position in its wars against England. In 1320 the world's first documented declaration of independence, the Declaration of Arbroath, won the support of Pope John XXII, leading to the legal recognition of Scottish sovereignty by the English Crown.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} six {{pieces were}} recorded at the Medinah Temple in Chicago, {{performed by the}} Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Levine. Pines of Rome was re-arranged in 1993 by Bruce Coughlin, who reduced the four-movement <b>piece</b> <b>by</b> cutting the second movement and trimming sections of {{the third and fourth}} movements. The piece was recorded on March 28, 1994. The second recording involved Symphony No. 5, Carnival of the Animals, and Pomp and Circumstance, on April 25, 1994. Carnival of the Animals, Finale uses two pianos played by Gail Niwa and Philip Sabransky. Pomp and Circumstance was arranged by Peter Schickele and features the Chicago Symphony Chorus and soprano soloist Kathleen Battle. The next recording took place on April 24, 1995 for Piano Concerto No. 2 with pianist Yefim Bronfman. On September 28, 1996, The Firebird was the final piece to be recorded; its session lasted for three hours. The piece was arranged using four sections from Stravinsky's 1919 revision of the score.|$|E
