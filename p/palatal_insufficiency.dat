40|$|Patients with {{acquired}} defects or {{congenital malformations}} of the palate exhibit disturbances in speech including hypernasality, nasal emission and decreased intelligibility of speech. Maxillofacial prosthesis {{is an art}} and science which not only replaces the lost structure but also sometimes restores the function. obtu-rator is a prosthesis which closes the palate and pharyngeal defects and improving the speech and other func-tion. This article presents a case report of a completely edentulous patient with <b>palatal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> rehabil-itated prosthodontically with a hollow bulb obturator and a procedure for fabrication of closed hollow bulb obturator prosthesis...|$|E
40|$|A 12 -year-old boy had {{problems}} with his speech due to a defect in the soft palate. This defect {{was caused by the}} surgical removal of a synovial sarcoma. Testing with a nasometer revealed hypernasality above normal values. Given the size and severity of the defect in the soft palate, the possibility of improving the speech with speech therapy was limited. At a centre for special dentistry an attempt was made with a prosthetic construction to improve the performance of the palate and, in that way, the speech. This construction consisted of a denture with an obturator attached to it. With it, an effective closure of the palate could be achieved. New measurements with acoustic nasometry showed scores within the normal values. The nasality in the speech largely disappeared. The obturator is an effective and relatively easy solution for <b>palatal</b> <b>insufficiency</b> resulting from surgical resection. Intrusive reconstructive surgery can be avoided in this way.
