50|$|Ralston (1958) {{showed that}} humans tend to walk {{at or near}} the speed that {{minimizes}} gross cost of transport. He showed that gross cost of transport is minimized at about 1.23 m/s, which corresponded to the <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> of his subjects. Supporting this, Wickler et al. (2000) showed that the <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> of horses both uphill and on the level corresponds closely to the speed that minimizes their gross cost of transport. Among other gait costs that human walkers choose to minimize, this observation has led many to suggest that people minimize cost and maximize efficiency during locomotion. Because gross cost of transport includes velocity, gross cost of transport includes an inherent value of time. Subsequent research suggests that individuals may walk marginally faster than the speed that minimizes gross cost of transport under some experimental setups, although {{this may be due to}} how preferred walking speed was measured.|$|E
50|$|The rate {{at which}} the {{environment}} flows past the eyes seems to be a mechanism for regulating walking speed. In virtual environments, the gain in visual flow can be decoupled from a person’s actual walking speed, much as one might experience when walking on a conveyor belt. There, the environment flows past an individual more quickly than their walking speed would predict (higher than normal visual gain). At higher than normal visual gains, individuals prefer to walk more slowly, while at lower than normal visual gains, individuals prefer to walk more quickly. This behavior is consistent with returning the visually observed speed back toward the <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> and suggests that vision is used correctively to maintain walking speed at a value that is perceived to be optimal. Moreover, the dynamics of this visual influence on preferred walking speed are rapid—when visual gains are changed suddenly, individuals adjust their speed within a few seconds. The timing and direction of these responses strongly indicate that a rapid predictive process informed by visual feedback helps select <b>preferred</b> <b>speed,</b> perhaps to complement a slower optimization process that directly senses metabolic rate and iteratively adapts gait to minimize it.|$|E

40|$|Vehicle crashes {{account for}} {{the highest number of}} {{fatalities}} for persons aged between 17 and 25 years of age in New Zealand. Despite a myriad of factors precipitating vehicle crashes, excess or inappropriate vehicle speed has been identified as the greatest predictor of crash likelihood and severity. Excess or inappropriate speed reduces a driver’s control over the vehicle, while exaggerating both collision force and the distances required in stopping or safely manoeuvring. One of the major differences identified between young and inexperienced and older more experienced drivers is the ability to adapt driving behaviour to road conditions. Young drivers are more prone to speeding through both a lack of awareness of risks and a desire to seek out novel and stimulating experiences. Recent developments in cognitive models of risk taking propose that older more experienced drivers may adapt their speed by “feeling out” the road conditions, where as young drivers may depend more upon posted limits to determine their speed. A video speed task was developed to measure speed preferences on a selection of road conditions (or ‘environments’) commonly confronting New Zealand motorists. Analyses of speed preferences revealed that young and inexperienced drivers <b>preferred</b> <b>speeds</b> close to the road-limit irrespective of conditions, whereas older and more experienced drivers <b>preferred</b> <b>speeds</b> clearly below the road limit, and demonstrated greater variation in speed preferences on different road environments. This suggests that young and inexperienced drivers both <b>prefer</b> faster <b>speeds</b> and may use the road limit as a target in determining an appropriate speed. Older and more experienced drivers <b>prefer</b> slower <b>speeds,</b> and adapt driving to changing road conditions. Faster <b>preferred</b> <b>speeds</b> were found to be related to a riskier attitudes towards driving in general, and more lenient attitudes toward speeding in particular. In addition, faster <b>preferred</b> <b>speeds</b> were found to be related to a heightened enjoyment of risk taking, as well as the number of speeding convictions issued in the previous 12 months. The used video speed task provided a convenient measure of speeding behaviour in natural driving scenarios, and appeared to be sensitive to differences in the way drivers adjust their behaviour across changing driving conditions. The video speed task might be useful in determining differences in speed choice between day and night time driving scenarios, as well as expanding the road conditions to including wet or foggy driving situations. This may be particularly useful in determining the pre- and post-effectiveness of driver training programs...|$|R

50|$|The {{algorithm}} integrated for crowd simulation in {{this approach}} is the RVO2 library which is a simple but effective model. Aside from the basic information such as the radius and maximum speed of each agent, it only requires the current position and preferred velocity of the agent to simulate one step. This approach adopts a strategy called ORCA (Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance) based on the computation of the velocity obstacles. At each time step, for each agent in the environment, velocity obstacles from other agents are computed. Then, the global optimal solution is then solved by linear programming. However, {{there is a small}} problem, the simulation needs information about the preferred velocity of each agent. This is typically done by using a vector with the direction towards the goal position and magnitude equal to the <b>preferred</b> <b>speed.</b> Here, {{it is not possible to}} learn about the goal position of each agent until the agent reaches there. Therefore, the velocity is estimated according the historical information. Then using the velocity we have a good chance of predicting the goal position of the agent. This estimation procedure is based on the sampling accelerations from each agent (Using the derivative of velocity). This leads to the problem solution.From conducted simulations, this method of tracking leads to an increase of tracking by 2% to 5% in the MOTP and MOTA metrics, on the UCSD crowd dataset.|$|E

Pre, during and post each condition, participants undertook measures of visual–cognitive performance. There were no significant main effects or higher order interactions for condition (rest, vs. walking <b>preferred</b> <b>speed,</b> vs. walking <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> + 20 %) or time (pre, during, post) (all P > 0. 05). There was a significant condition X time interaction for response time (P = 0. 014, partial ɳ 2 = 0. 352). Post hoc analysis indicated that response times were significantly faster during exercise at <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> compared to pre exercise at <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> (P = 0. 042). Response times were significantly slower during walking at <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> + 20 % compared to pre exercise (P = 0. 002) and to post exercise (P = 0. 012).

40|$|Several {{measures}} {{have been developed to}} quantify swimming performance to understand various aspects of ecology and behaviour, as well as to help design functional applications for fishways and aquaculture. One of those measures, the optimal swimming speed, is the speed at which the cost of transport (COT) is minimal, where COT is defined as the cost of moving unit mass over unit distance. The experimental protocol to determine the optimal swimming speed involves forced-swimming in a flume or respirometer. In this study, a 4. 5 –m-long tilted raceway with gradually increasing upstream water speed is used to determine a novel, behaviourally based swimming parameter: the <b>preferred</b> swimming <b>speed.</b> The optimal swimming <b>speed</b> and the <b>preferred</b> swimming <b>speed</b> of brook charr were determined and a comparison of the two reveals that the optimal swimming speed (25. 9  ±  4. 5  cm s− 1 or 1. 02  ±  0. 47  bl s− 1) reflected the <b>preferred</b> swimming <b>speed</b> (between 20  cm s− 1 or 0. 78  ±  0. 02  bl s− 1 and 25  cm s− 1 or 0. 95  ±  0. 03  bl s− 1).

The Physiological Cost Index (PCI) proposed by MacGregor is a simple and straightforward method to estimate the energy expenditure index. Here, we aim to estimate the energy expenditure among young Asian population using MacGregor’s equation. &# 13; Methods: A total of 50 young randomly selected healthy females performed 50 m, 100 m and 150 m walking test at their self-selected <b>preferred</b> <b>speed.</b> The physiological cost index values for 100 m walk at speeds slower and faster than the <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> were also obtained. The physiological cost index during exercise was calculated using MacGregor’s equation considering heart rate and speed of walking over the varying distances. &# 13; Results: The PCI values on three different distances are consistent during self selected <b>preferred</b> <b>speed.</b> The PCI estimation on second and third tests for all three distances walked consistently reproducible. However for each distance walked, the first test the PCI {{was significantly higher than}} the second and third test values.

40|$|Older {{adults have}} been shown to {{naturally}} select a walking speed approximately 20 % slower than younger adults. We explored the possibility that a reduction in <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> in older adults represents a strategy to preserve the mechanical function of the leg muscles. We examined this question in the soleus muscle in eight healthy young (25. 8 3. 5 years) and eight healthy older adults (66. 1 2. 3 years) who were paired so that their <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> differed by 20 %. Soleus muscle fascicle lengths were recorded dynamically using ultrasound, together with simultaneous measurements of soleus EMG activity and ankle joint kinematics while (a) older adults walked on a treadmill at a speed 20 % above their <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> (speeds matched to the <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> of young adults), and (b) young and older adults walked at their preferred treadmill speeds. Analyses of mean muscle fascicle length changes revealed that, at matched speeds, older adults had a statistically different soleus fascicle length pattern compared to young adults, where the muscle's stretch-shorten cycle during stance was diminished. However, older adults walking at their <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> exhibited a more pronounced stretch-shorten cycle that was not statistically different from young adults. Conserving muscle length patterns through a reduction in speed in older adults may represent a physiologically relevant modulation of muscle function that permits greater force and power production. Our findings offer a novel mechanical explanation for the slower walking speed in older adults, whereby a reduction in speed may permit muscles to function in a mechanically similar manner to that of younger adults.

40|$|Adaptation is a {{ubiquitous}} {{property of}} the visual system. Adaptation often improves the ability to discriminate between stimuli and increases the operating range of the system, but is also associated with a reduced ability to veridically code stimulus attributes. Adaptation to luminance levels, contrast, orientation, direction and spatial frequency has been studied extensively, but knowledge about adaptation to image speed is less well understood. Here we examined how the speed tuning of neurons in cat primary visual cortex was altered after adaptation to speeds that were slow, optimal, or fast relative to each neuron’s speed response function. We found that the <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> (defined as the speed eliciting the peak firing rate) of the neurons following adaptation was dependent on {{the speed at which}} they were adapted. At the population level cells showed decreases in <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> following adaptation to speeds at or above the non-adapted speed, but the <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> did not change following adaptation to speeds lower than the non-adapted peak. Almost all cells showed response gain control (reductions in absolute firing capacity) following speed adaptation. We also investigated the speed dependence of contrast adaptation and found that most cells showed contrast gain control (rightward shifts of their contrast response functions) and response gain control following adaptation at any speed. We conclude that contrast adaptation may produce the response gain control associated with speed adaptation, but shifts in <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> require an additional level of processing beyond contrast adaptation. A simple model is presented that is able to capture most of the findings...|$|E

There are inconsistent findings in clinical trials regarding effects of exercise on <b>preferred</b> gait <b>speed,</b> and heterogeneity in interventions in the current reviews and meta-analyses. Objective: to determine the meta-effects of different types or combinations of exercise interventions from randomized controlled trials on improvement in <b>preferred</b> gait <b>speed.</b> Methods: Data sources: A literature search was performed; the following databases were searched for studies from 1990 up to 9 December 2013 : PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO (AMED, CINAHL, ERIC, Medline, PsycInfo, and SocINDEX), and the Cochrane Library. Study eligibility criteria: Randomized controlled trials of exercise interventions for older adults >= 65 years, that provided quantitative data (mean/SD) on <b>preferred</b> gait <b>speed</b> at baseline and post-intervention, as a primary or secondary outcome measure in the published article were included. Studies were excluded when the PEDro score was Study appraisal and synthesis methods: intervals and random weights assigned to each trial. Homogeneity and risk of publication bias were assessed.

The difference between intervention-and control groups shows a substantial meaningful change (> 0. 1 m/s). Secondly, a significant positive meta-effect of interventions with a rhythmic component on <b>preferred</b> gait <b>speed</b> of 0. 07 [CI 95 % 0. 03 - 0. 10] m/s was found. Thirdly, there is a small significant positive meta-effect of progressive resistance training, combined with balance-, and endurance training of 0. 05 [CI 95 % 0. 00 - 0. 09] m/s. The other sub-analyses show non-significant small positive meta-affects.

40|$|Background: If {{visually}} impaired people had their sight fully restored, {{it is assumed}} that they would walk at their optimal speeds. Previous mobility studies have used <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed</b> (PWS) to measure walking efficiency of {{visually impaired}} adults. Therefore, the actual speeds that visually impaired people adopt on a route can be expressed as a percentage of their <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed</b> (PPWS). There have bee two approaches used in previous studies for determining <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed.</b> 1. 	the sighted guide technique (SG), which requires a subject to walk with a sighted guide and regard the latter as a perfect mobility aid, with the subject setting the preferred (optimal) walking pace. 2. 	the non- sighted guide technique (nonSG), which requires a subject to walk alone along an unobstructed straight path for a certain distance, adopting the <b>preferred</b> (optimal) walking <b>speed.</b> There is some debate on which technique is the better.

40|$|Purpose: Older adults walk {{slower than}} young adults, {{but it is}} not known why. Previous {{research}} suggests that ankle plantarflexors may have {{a crucial role in the}} reduction of walking speed. The purpose of this study was to investigate age-related differences in triceps surae muscle–tendon function during walking to further investigate the role of plantarflexors in the age-related reduction of walking speed. Methods: Medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscle fascicle lengths were measured using ultrasound imaging during walking from 13 young (25 ± 4 yr) men at preferred walking speed and from 13 older (73 ± 5 yr) men at <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> and at the young men’s <b>preferred</b> <b>speed.</b> Muscle–tendon unit lengths were calculated from joint kinematics, and tendinous tissue lengths were calculated by subtracting muscle lengths from muscle–tendon unit lengths. In addition, ground reaction forces and electromyographic activity of medial gastrocnemius and soleus were measured. Results: In both medial gastrocnemius and soleus, it was observed that at preferred walking speed, older men used a narrower muscle fascicle operating range and lower shortening velocity at the estimated time of triceps surae peak force generation compared with young men. Fascicles also accounted for a lower proportion of muscle–tendon unit length changes during the stance phase in older compared with young men. Significant differences in triceps surae muscle function were not observed between age groups when compared at matched walking speed. Conclusions: In older men, walking at <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> allows triceps surae muscles to generate force with more favorable shortening velocity and to enhance use of tendinous tissue elasticity compared with walking at young men’s <b>preferred</b> <b>speed.</b> The results suggest that older men may prefer slower walking speeds to compensate for decreased plantarflexor strength...|$|E

We asked whether variation in pursuit could arise from noise in the response of visual motion neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT). In physiological experiments, we evaluated the mean, variance, and trial-by-trial correlation in the spike counts of pairs of simultaneously recorded MT neurons. The correlations between responses of pairs of MT neurons are highly significant and are stronger when the two neurons in a pair have similar <b>preferred</b> <b>speeds,</b> directions, or receptive field locations. Spike count correlation persists when the same exact stimulus form is repeatedly presented. Spike count correlations increase as the analysis window increases because of correlations in the responses of individual neurons across time.

40|$|No {{theory of}} driver {{behaviour}} has yet managed to achieve widespread acceptance and {{use in the}} field of Traffic Psychology, partly due to the difficulty in testing many of the theories. However, one class of theories, the motivational theories, can be usefully split into two groups and the differences between them can then be examined. One group posits the constant monitoring and targeting of a certain subjective variable, often risk, as the controlling factor in driving. The other group however states that subjective variables such as risk are only relevant once a certain threshold has been passed. In this study we aimed to examine this difference by manipulating both speed of travel and the amount of cognitive load participants were under. Participants were asked to initially drive at their <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> for 1 min in a driving simulator. Participant's speed was then automatically increased or decreased by 10, 20 30 km/h or left unchanged. Participants were then required to maintain the new speed for 1 min. After this 1 min the speed was again automatically changed and had to be maintained for one more minute, but this time participants also carried out a secondary mental arithmetic task. Finally participants were asked to again drive for another 1 min at their <b>preferred</b> <b>speed.</b> This procedure was repeated seven times, once for each speed manipulation; - 30, - 20, - 10, + 0, + 10, + 20 and + 30 km/h. After each 1 min interval verbal ratings of task difficulty, effort, feeling of risk and the typicality of the speed were collected. The results show a threshold effect in ratings of task difficulty, effort and feeling of risk, with no significant difference given between the ratings during the baseline period and the experimentally decreased speed periods until after participant's <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> of travel had been exceeded. Furthermore, even when under cognitive load the threshold relationship was still apparent, if diminished. Finally it appears that when under cognitive load drivers have difficulty maintaining a travelling speed which is lower than the speed at which they would prefer to drive. However, driving at a speed in excess of their <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> appears to be easier to maintain, {{at least in the short}} term. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{gain insight}} into {{underlying}} mechanisms of inactive lifestyles among adults with spastic bilateral cerebral palsy (CP) {{with a focus on}} aerobic capacity, oxygen consumption, and physical strain during walking at <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed,</b> as well as fatigue. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: University hospital. Participants: Adults (N= 36), aged 25 to 45 years, with spastic bilateral CP, walking with (n= 6) or without (n= 30) walking aids. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Physical strain during walking was defined as oxygen uptake during walking, expressed as percentage of peak aerobic capacity. Participants with spastic bilateral CP walked their <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed</b> while oxygen uptake was measured using a portable gas analyzer. Peak aerobic capacity was measured during maximal cycle ergometry. An accelerometry-based activity monitor measured total daily walking time. Regression analyses were performed to assess the relation between aerobic capacity, oxygen uptake, and physical strain of walking {{on the one hand and}} total daily walking time on the other hand. Results: Neither aerobic capacity nor oxygen uptake during walking was related to total daily walking time (r(2) =. 29, P=. 10 and r(2) =. 27, P=. 16, respectively). Physical strain of walking at <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed</b> was inversely related to total daily walking time (r(2) =. 44, P Conclusions: Physical strain during walking is moderately related to total daily walking time, implying that people with high physical strain during walking at <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed</b> likely walk less in daily life.

40|$|Previously {{conducted}} trials {{comparing the}} gait pattern {{of individuals with}} a transfemoral amputation using a user-adaptive and a non-microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee (NMPK) found mixed and conflicting results. Few trials, however, have compared user-adaptive to non-adaptive prosthetic knees across different walking speeds. Because of the ability of variable damping, the effect of user-adaptive knees might be more pronounced at lower or higher walking speeds. Our aim was to compare the Rheo Knee II (a microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee) with NMPKs across varying walking speeds. In addition, we studied compensatory mechanisms associated with non-optimal prosthetic knee kinematics, such as intact ankle vaulting and vertical acceleration of the pelvis. Nine persons with a transfemoral amputation or knee disarticulation were included and measured with their own NMPK and with the Rheo Knee II. Measurements were performed at three walking speeds: <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed,</b> 70 % <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed</b> and 115 % <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed.</b> No differences on peak prosthetic knee flexion during swing were found between prosthetic knee conditions. In addition, prosthetic knee flexion increased significantly with walking speed for both prosthetic knee conditions. At 70 % <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed</b> we found that vaulting of the intact ankle was significantly decreased while walking with the Rheo Knee II compared to the NMPK condition (P = 0. 028). We did not find differences in peak vertical acceleration of the pelvis during initial and mid-swing of the prosthetic leg. In conclusion, comparison of walking with the Rheo Knee II to walking with a NMPK across different walking speeds showed limited differences in gait parameters...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{a limited}} {{understanding}} about how gait speed influences the control of upper body motion during walking. Therefore, {{the primary purpose of}} this study was to examine how gait speed influences healthy individual's lower trunk motion during overground walking. The secondary purpose was to assess if Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to gain further insight into postural responses that occur at different walking speeds. Methods: Thirteen healthy subjects (23 ± 3 years) performed 5 straight-line walking trials at self selected slow, preferred, and fast walking speeds. Accelerations of the lower trunk were measured in the anterior-posterior (AP), vertical (VT), and mediolateral (ML) directions using a triaxial accelerometer. Stride-to-stride acceleration amplitude, regularity and repeatability were examined with RMS acceleration, Approximate Entropy and Coefficient of Multiple determination respectively. Coupling between acceleration directions were calculated using Cross Approximate Entropy. PCA was used to reveal the dimensionality of trunk accelerations during walking at slow and <b>preferred</b> <b>speeds,</b> and <b>preferred</b> and fast <b>speeds.</b> Results: RMS acceleration amplitude increased with gait speed in all directions.
