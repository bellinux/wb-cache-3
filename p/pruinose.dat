5|$|Within {{the section}} Mycena, M.multiplicata {{is similar to}} the Malaysian species M.obcalyx in having a grayish-white cap, lobed cheilocystidia with finger-like outgrowths, and a lignicolous habitat. M.obcalyx may be {{distinguished}} by forming much smaller fruit bodies (with caps 2–4mm wide) with subdecurrent gills, a <b>pruinose,</b> hyaline white stem, and broadly ellipsoid spores.|$|E
500|$|The cap, which reaches [...] in diameter, is {{initially}} conical to convex to bell-shaped, but becomes flattened in age. It is radially grooved {{almost to the}} center, and somewhat hygrophanous (changing color as it loses or absorbs moisture). The cap surface is dry, minutely [...] initially (that is, appearing as if covered with a fine white powder), but soon becomes smooth. The cap is brown to brownish-orange when young, with a somewhat darker center, and fades to paler toward the margin with age. The flesh is white, and up to 0.5mm thick. It {{does not have any}} distinctive taste or odor. The stem is [...] long by [...] thick, cylindrical, centrally attached to the cap, slender, hollow, and dry. Its color is orange to brownish-orange, and it {{is initially}} <b>pruinose,</b> but later becomes smooth. The base of the stem is covered with coarse, stiff white hairs. The gills are adnexed (narrowly attached to the stem), and distantly spaced, with between 16 and 18 gills reaching the stem. The gills are up to 1.8mm broad, thin, and pale brownish. The gill edges are <b>pruinose,</b> and the same color as the gill face.|$|E
500|$|The cap is conical to convex to bell-shaped, {{occasionally}} {{with a low}} {{and broad}} umbo, and reaches [...] in diameter. When moist, it is partly translucent, and grooves corresponding {{to the position of}} the gills under tha cap can be seen. The surface is somewhat hygrophanous—it changes color as it loses or absorbs moisture. The surface is initially —covered with {{what appears to be a}} fine white powder (remnants of the universal veil that covered the immature fruit body)—but this soon sloughs off, leaving it smooth. The cap surface is a dull violet color when young, then becomes somewhat paler near the margin. The flesh is up to 0.5mm thick, white, and lacks any distinctive odor and taste. The slender stem is [...] long by [...] thick, cylindrical, centrally attached to the cap, and hollow. Its surface is dry, dull violet to grayish-violet over the entire length. Like the cap surface, it is initially entirely <b>pruinose,</b> but becomes smooth in maturity. The base of the stem is covered with sharp, straight, and stiff white hairs. The gills are narrowly attached to the stem, and distantly spaced, with between 15 and 19 gills reaching the stem. The gills are up to 1.2mm broad, thin, and pale brownish.

5000|$|This cicada is {{the loudest}} calling Eastern Neotibicen species, with male alarm calls {{recorded}} at 105.9 dB. Neotibicen pronotalis {{is a large}} cicada with males reaching up to 40 mm (body length not including wings), but it averages from 36 - 39 mm; rivaling Neotibicen auletes and Neotibicen resonans in size (N. auletes and N. resonans are other species of large North American cicadas). Adult N. pronotalis vary considerably in appearance. Pronotum coloration may be sandy orange, tan, lime green, ocherous yellow, dull yellow or orange, or any combination of these. Eye coloration varies as well, most individuals though, have slate blue eyes, although some may have green, brown, or tan eyes [...] The venter is lightly <b>pruinosed.</b> N. pronotalis have variable mesonotal coloration and patterning, which can be the typical well-defined Neotibicen mesonotal patterns or dark, obscure patterns. Mesontal colors are usually tan, red, and black. The abdomen is a dark gray or black. N. pronotalis can be found {{throughout much of the}} Midwestern and Southeastern United States Neotibicen pronotalis has two subspecies, both equally common, Neotibicen pronotalis walkeri and Neotibicen pronotalis pronotalis, pronotalis individuals generally have a black pronotal blotch, while walkeri individuals lack a pronotal blotch. The call of N. pronotalis is identical to that of a similar species, Neotibicen dealbatus. For this reason, the two can be commonly confused.|$|R
500|$|The cap is {{initially}} conical to convex to bell-shaped, then flattened in age, ultimately reaching [...] in diameter. The {{center of the}} cap is irregularly wrinkled to pitted, but less so toward the grooved margin. It is hygrophanous (changing color as it loses or absorbs water), dry, initially <b>pruinose</b> (covered with {{what appears to be}} a fine white powder), but soon becomes smooth. The color is blackish-brown at the center, dark brown to reddish-brown farther outward, and becoming much paler at the margin; sometimes the cap is evenly dark brown. The flesh is up to 1mm thick and white, and does not have any distinctive taste and odor. The stem is [...] long by [...] wide, cylindrical, slightly enlarged at the base, central, slender, and hollow. The stem surface is dry, <b>pruinose</b> over the entire length, and does not become smooth with age. It is pale brownish at the top, and gradually becomes dark brown toward the base. The base is covered with a white mycelial hairlike growth (a tomentum) that is attached to white cord-like rhizomorphs on the substratum. The gills are fused to the stem, and distantly spaced, with between 15 and 18 gills reaching the stem. The gills are up to 2.5mm broad, thin, grayish, and have distinct veins running between them. The gill edges are the same color as the gill faces.|$|E
500|$|The cylindrical, hollow stipe {{typically}} measures [...] long by [...] thick, {{with the}} base slightly thicker. The {{top of the}} stipe is <b>pruinose</b> (covered with white powdery granules), while the base is connected to thick white rhizomorphs. The stipe surface is smooth to silky fibrillose (as if made of silky, slender fibers), and its color initially white before yellowing slightly in age. Mycelium {{at the base of}} the stipe is white or stained blue. All parts of the fruitbody stain blue if bruised or handled. Young specimens have a white partial veil that later disappears, or remains as a zone on the stipe that can be colored purplish brown by spores. The odor and taste of the mushroom is farinaceous—similar to freshly ground flour.|$|E
500|$|The cap of M.leptocephala is [...] in diameter, and {{initially}} a fat conical shape with the margin pressed {{close to the}} stem. As the cap expands, it becomes broadly conic to convex, sometimes broadly bell-shaped, and sometimes convex with a flaring margin. The cap surface has a whitish sheen because of its [...] coating. The coating gradually sloughs off, leaving the surface smooth and moist. The cap shows radial grooves that outline {{the position of the}} gills underneath. Its color is initially dusky brownish-gray to blackish (after the <b>pruinose</b> coating has sloughed off), soon fading from dark to light gray and finally ashy-gray. The flesh is thin and fragile, grayish, and has a slightly sour (...) taste, and a weakly alkaline odor that strengthens in intensity if the flesh is crushed. The gills are narrow, equal in width throughout, ascending-adnate (the gills attach at much less than a right angle, appearing to curve upward toward stem) and toothed. They are subdistantly spaced, with 18–27 gills reaching the stem, and one or two tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem) interspersed between them. The color of the gills is pallid or cinereous, with pallid and even edges. The stem is [...] long, 1–2mm thick, equal in width throughout, hollow, and very fragile. It is usually bluish-black initially (darker than the cap) but gradually turns sordid brownish-gray, and finally fades to pallid or cinereous. The surface is densely white-pruinose overall, but soon polished and translucent when the <b>pruinose</b> coating wears off. The stem base is nearly smooth to rather densely white-. The species has a distinctive bleach-like odor. Its edibility is currently unknown.|$|E
500|$|The gills are subdecurrent (running only a {{small way}} {{down the length of}} the stem), close to crowded together, narrow, and {{sometimes}} forked near the stem. Their color is whitish, becoming pink-tinged, turning pale tan with age. The adult stem is [...] long, [...] thick, fragile, more or less equal in width throughout, and cylindrical or narrowed at the base. Its surface is dry, and either smooth to <b>pruinose</b> (covered with a very fine whitish powder on the surface). The color ranges from pale light pink to yellowish-tinged or slightly pinkish orange to orange white, sometimes spotted. The interior of the stem is firm, beige white, and filled with a soft pith, but it eventually becomes hollow. Occasionally, white mycelium is visible at the base of the stem where it meets the ground.|$|E
500|$|The gills have an adnate {{attachment}} to the cap, are narrow to moderately broad, closely spaced, and eventually separate from the stem. Young gills are cinnamon-brown in color, with lighter edges, but darken in maturity because they become covered with the dark spores. The stem is [...] long by [...] thick, and roughly equal in width throughout except for a slightly enlarged base. The lower region of the stem is brownish in color and has silky [...] "hairs" [...] pressed against the stem; the upper region is grayish and <b>pruinose</b> (lightly dusted with powdery white granules). The flesh turns slightly bluish or greenish {{where it has been}} injured. The application of a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide solution on the cap or flesh will cause a color change to pale to dark yellowish to reddish brown; a drop on the stem produces a less intense or no color change.|$|E

500|$|The gills appear closely spaced in {{unexpanded}} caps, {{but usually}} more distant in old individuals. Between 8 and 16 gills extend from the margin to the stipe; there are additionally {{one or two}} tiers of small gills (lamellulae) that do not reach fully from the margin to the stipe. The gills are narrow but become [...] (swelling in the middle) and sometimes very broad in age, and are attached by a line or are very narrowly adnate.
