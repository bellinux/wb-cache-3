5000|$|De Vasselot's {{appointment}} as Superintendent of Woods and Forests followed in 1880. This {{was the first}} time that a professional forester had been put in charge and was a turning point in South African forestry. For the first time the authorities were persuaded that a sound silvicultural policy was of greater importance than the revenue derived from exploitation. The details of the new management system were spelled out in the Forest Regulation of 1883. When de Vasselot left the Cape in 1891, the forests of George, Knysna and the Tsitsikamma were being managed on a scientific basis. Two important publications by de Vasselot in 1885 were an [...] "Introduction to the Systematic Treatment of the Crown Forests of the Cape Colony" [...] and a pamphlet on [...] "Selection and Seasoning of Wood", both translated into English by the then Conservator of Transkeian Forests, A. W. Heywood. In 1898 Heywood was succeeded by Colin MacNaughton as Conservator at Knysna,where he marked out the first <b>permanent</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> in the forests to study indigenous tree communities, laying a valuable foundation for research into forest ecosystems. [...] McNaughton strongly believed that the ‘forests must be worked in the interests of the country, and not in the interests of the immediate population’. That is, trees should be considered a national resource, and not relevant to the livelihood of communities who exploited the forest.|$|E
50|$|On {{the basis}} of tests of 3 logging systems in Alberta, Brace (1990) affirmed that {{significant}} amounts of understorey can be retained using any of those systems provided that sufficient effort is directed towards protection. Potential benefits would include increased short-term softwood timber supply, improved wildlife habitat and cutblock aesthetics, as well as reduced public criticism of previous logging practices. Stewart et al. (2001) developed statistical models to predict the natural establishment and height growth of understorey white spruce in the boreal mixedwood forest in Alberta using data from 148 <b>permanent</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots</b> and supplementary information about height growth of white spruce regeneration and the amount and type of available substrate. A discriminant model correctly classified 73% of the sites as to {{presence or absence of}} a white spruce understorey, based on the amount of spruce basal area, rotten wood, ecological nutrient regime, soil clay fraction, and elevation, although it explained only 30% of the variation in the data. On sites with a white spruce understorey, a regression model related the abundance of regeneration to rotten wood cover, spruce basal area, pine basal area, soil clay fraction, and grass cover (R² = 0.36). About half the seedlings surveyed grew on rotten wood, and only 3% on mineral soil, and seedlings were 10 {{times more likely to have}} established on these substrates than on litter. Exposed mineral soil covered only 0.3% of the observed transect area.|$|E

Transect made of four (4) lanes in the direction of the wind, which is the aspect of the East, West, South, and North, with the width of each lane 20 meters long and ± 500. The results of the research are 48 species that include: 36 species of trees with 745 individuals, 37 species of poles with 904 individuals, 29 species of saplings with 1. 266 individuals, 30 species of seedlings with 1. 960 individuals.

40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that there are still some {{contradictory}} viewpoints on the matter of increasing of forest total productivity by cleaning cuttings the given research has been done.

40|$|A {{calculation}} procedure is presented for calculating and analysing remeasured <b>permanent</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plots.</b> Data for eight different fixed and variable size plot types were simulated {{on the basis}} of two stands whose trees were mapped and measured in 1982 and 1986.

The {{calculation procedure}} is based on treewise expansion factors and the division of trees sampled into state/measurement classes. Nine classes were required for variable size plots and six for fixed size plots. A relascope plot with basal-area factor 1 (m 2 /ha) proved to be most efficient for estimating basal-area at a given time and a fixed size circular plot with radius 10 m for estimating basal-area increment over a given time period. The main problems were related to the estimation of non-measurable variables, e. g., the initial diameters of ingrowth trees, i. e., trees having passed the threshold size during the measurement period. Most problematic were cut trees belonging to the ingrowth or sample enlargement classes.

40|$|Quantitative {{study of}} the <b>permanent</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> (PSP) {{database}} can provide insights into growth, mortality and recruitment processes driving forest dynamics. Modelling the dynamics of forest growth and yield provides opportunities for optimising silvicultural systems and generating accurate growth and yield estimates, which are fundamental to sustainable forest management. This paper will outline model development based on analysis of a large native forest <b>permanent</b> <b>sample</b> <b>plot</b> database in Papua New Guinea. We quantify the competitive influences affecting individual tree growth and mortality, and build predictive models for growth and mortality based on a hierarchical Bayesian modelling methodology. This method allows the parameterisation of a global model with species-specific parameters; therefore, species-level growth and mortality traits are preserved in model predictions, even for rare species. We examine a range of spatial and non-spatial competition indexes for the data, and conclude that a simple non-spatial competition index (basal area of competing trees within 20 metres of the subject) adequately characterises competitive influences on growth and mortality. In future work, species-specific model parameters {{can be used as}} the basis of a forest simulation system (see [URL] for developments) to improve the design and intensity of selectiveharvesting regimes at the community and the concession level.

The effects of both site quality class and drainage phase were stronger on pine mires than on spruce mires, most probably due to the longer fertility gradient and large potential free growing space in the former group.
