5000|$|In July 1897, the Third Congress of the International Institute of Sociology at the Sorbonne in Paris erupted with {{debate over}} the organic theory of societies. In the {{capacity}} of the Institute's president, Lilienfeld, then a senator in the Russian parliament, traveled from Saint Petersburg and delivered the opening address on the afternoon of Wednesday, July 21. Remarks and the reading of two papers followed. The next day, Thursday, July 22, a paper by Lester F. Ward (not able to attend the conference) on [...] "Pain and Pleasure Economy" [...] was read in the morning, along with another paper by Italian sociologist Achille Loria. It was only after the break for lunch that the {{debate over the}} organic theory began. Jacques Novicow started by reading a paper in support of the theory. He was followed by Lilienfeld. Next, Gabriel Tarde heavily critiqued Lilienfeld and Novicow, [...] "and presented in opposition to the organic theory a psychological theory of social life" [...] (Worms 1898: 110). The session adjourned for the evening, and discussion resumed the next afternoon, Friday, July 23. Casimir de Kelles-Krauz opened the offensive against the organic theory with a salvo of economic materialism. Ludwig Stein then backed up Tarde and Kelles-Krauz with [...] "the principles of the historical and <b>psychogenetic</b> method of research" [...] (Worms 1898: 111). The founder and general secretary of the Institute, René Worms, next [...] "tried to show something of the exactness and utility of the analogy between organisms and society" [...] (Worms 1898: 111). Worms's attempt, however, was rebuffed by S. R. Steinmetz. Furthermore, though Raphael Garofalo, Charles Limousin, and C. N. Starcke accepted the organic theory, they did so with reservations. The most withering attack on the organic theory seemed to come from Nikolai Karéiev, who [...] "showed that this theory shared, together with Darwin's social theory, economic materialism and social psychic theories, the fate of all exclusive theories" [...] (Worms 1898: 111). Alfred Espinas then tried to salvage the theory by maintaining that societies must [...] "constitute organisms," [...] or else one would have [...] "to abandon altogether the idea of social life and social laws" [...] (Worms 1898: 111). Novicow closed the section by reaffirming his faith in the organic theory, and Worms in his report stated that, by and large, the congress had [...] "been productive of the most happy results" [...] (Worms 1898: 109).|$|E

In this study, we sought to understand how is the process of ethical formation in traditional philosophy, Christian and Piaget's <b>psychogenetic.</b> We performed a qualitative analysis of the secular literature of Immanuel Kant, Jean Piaget and the Bible, seeking possible relationships and differences between these theoretical paradigms. We found that, despite the traditional philosophies, Christian <b>psychogenetic</b> submit the same goal before the need of the discipline of Ethics, since they all intend to seek the "good", the definitions, concepts, content in subject's ethical formation are distinct. The text points out that, in addressing the ethical formation in the subject, the traditional philosophy of Immanuel Kant points to the categorical imperative, regardless of human action, opposing the <b>psychogenetic</b> and Christian thought, as they punctuate the need for the action of the subject, first emphasizing the "want"" to then "make" ethical and moral actions.

Ao abordar a formação ética no sujeito, a filosofia tradicional de Emanuel Kant aponta para o imperativo categórico, independente da ação humana, se opondo ao pensamento psicogenético e cristão, pois estes pontuam a necessidade da ação do sujeito, enfatizando primeiramente o “querer”, para, em seguida “efetuar” ações ética e morais...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The {{stage or}} phase of this {{research}} project is intended to perform an analysis of approaches for teacher ́s training and early literacy of current language programs in Mexico ́s teacher education. The central con-tent of the document contains the analysis of approaches of teachers ́ trai-ning and initial literacy that lie behind educational programs. The theoretical approach is supported by Pérez Gómez (1996) and {{in the field of}} literacy in Ferreiro and Teberobsky (2007) and Lerner (2001). The research methodology is projected into the reconstructive critical pa-radigm as a diagnostic part of a future participative action research that will be conducted in two remaining stages. The perspective of analysis is established by the methodological contributions of Habermas (2008), in the hermeneutic reconstruction of implicit in the analyzed documents approaches. The results and discussion of them that provide lines of analysis of educa-tional programs, the relationship between theory and practice in curriculum approaches and a proposal of teachers profile requirements of language courses for teaching training as well as suggestions for future restructuring of curricula for teacher ́s colleges. In the conclusion, it is established that the perspective and the teacher training approach identified in the curriculum of Primary Education Degree (1997 and 2012) Preschool Education Degree (1999 and 2012) is mainly a model technical decision-making. This explains that the formative processes in teaching students of Tea-chers colleges, {{there is a tendency to}} engage in activities that are based on the theory, performing analytical processes that lead to understand the di-dactical principles of approaches for teaching reading instruction and writing, which will be applied in decision-making processes in situ of teaching practi-ce.

There is convincing evidence suggesting that ASD are associated with various sleep disorders at times of extreme severity.

40|$|This book {{describes}} how the violent dimension of intergroup relations can be better understood if the interplay between psychological and social-developmental factors is taken into account. Ten unique, innovative and original chapters by international scholars of social and developmental psychology address the way how social reality is constructed as a hierarchical order, and how social norms, beliefs and cognitive-behavioral patterns are learned, shared and repeatedly processed on how to uphold or challenge this social order. The volume covers diverse {{issues such as the}} effects (or lack thereof) of power and violent video games on people’s thinking and behavior, the acquisition of social norms and attitudes during childhood, minorities’ identity management strategies, the role of mothers’ educational beliefs and the impact of ideologies. This volume is inspired by the oeuvre of Maria Benedicta Monteiro, emphasizing the <b>psychogenetic</b> and sociogenic diacronies that are too often neglected by the predominantly synchronic paradigm of social psychology. It is therefore an indispensable reading for researchers and advanced students in social, community and developmental psychology, for scientifically interested practitioners working with families, school contexts or intergroup conflict, and for everyone interested in the expanding field of the social developmental approaches to attitudes and behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Background: Consultation-Liaison (C-L) psychiatry, the {{discipline}} practiced by psychiatrists working with medical patients, has expanded considerably and the approval as the newest psychiatric subspecialty in the USA has been welcomed. However, the new denomination chosen, Psychosomatic Medicine, has stirred-up controversies in Europe. Methods: Review {{of the literature}} and discussion of historical, empirical and philosophical bases for a new proposal. Results: We argue that a new denomination is appropriate, and consider the term psychiatry unnegotiable: {{we are dealing with}} a specialized area in the psychiatric field, the answer from psychiatry to meet doctors' demands; and the complexity of psychopathological problems presented in medical patients requires specialized experience. Furthermore, contrary to some reductionist, biological views, we consider psychiatry a conspicuous, humanistic medical discipline. We also support the adjective psychosomatic, which reflects the history of the humanistic and scientific 'psychosomatic movement' in medicine. However, the ambiguities surrounding the word should be minimized. Psychosomatic views have been and may still be a stimulus for productive research and for advance in the field, but the excesses of some <b>psychogenetic,</b> non evidence-based theories should be firmly criticized. Conclusion: We argue strongly in favour of the denomination Psychosomatic Psychiatry for {{the discipline}} practiced by psychiatrists working with medical patients, in the intersection with other medical specialities...|$|E
