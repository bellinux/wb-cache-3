25|$|Although {{for many}} years after her death Clara Schumann was not widely {{recognized}} as a composer, as a pianist she made an impression which lasts until today. She {{was one of the}} first pianists to perform from memory, making that the standard for concertizing. Trained by her father to <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> and to memorize, she gave public performances from memory as early as age thirteen, a fact noted as something exceptional by her reviewers.|$|E
25|$|Abraham Mateo {{was born}} on 25 August 1998 in San Fernando, Cádiz, the younger child of Antonio Mateo, a {{construction}} worker and security guard, and Susana Chamorro, a housewife. He has an older brother, Tony, who also sings and plays music. Mateo {{was born into a}} family with musical roots; his maternal grandfather was a tenor soloist with a church choir, his paternal grandfather was a flamenco singer, and his mother sings Boleros and Spanish music. He started singing at the age of three by imitating the performances of the TV talent show Operación Triunfo. Mateo's first vocal coach was his mother Susana and he later continued his music education by attending singing lessons. He learned to play flute at age six, piano and keyboard at age eight, and acoustic guitar at age ten, teaching himself how to <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{child with}} perfect pitch, Tatum learned to <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear,</b> picking out church hymns {{by the age}} of three, {{learning}} tunes from the radio and copying piano roll recordings his mother owned. [...] In a Voice of America interview, he denied the widespread rumor that he learned to play by copying piano roll recordings made by two pianists. He developed a very fast playing style, without losing accuracy. As a child he was also very sensitive to the piano's intonation and insisted it be tuned often. While playing piano was the most obvious application of his mental and physical skills, he also had an encyclopedic memory for Major League Baseball statistics.|$|E

40|$|The study {{presented}} here explored how group <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear,</b> or Group Ear Playing (GEP), through the imitation of recorded material {{and opportunities for}} inventive work during peer interaction supported first year undergraduate western classical music students’ aural, creative and improvisation skills. The approach to <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> adopted {{in this study is}} based on Lucy Green’s (2014) work on the use of informal learning practices in formal music education. The framework that emerged from the analysis of the data describes two routes taken by the students, whilst progressing from GEP to group improvisation. This study advocates that through <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> in groups western classical musicians within Higher Education can develop their creative, collaborative and improvisation skills...|$|R

2500|$|Around age eleven, Mary Albert {{moved to}} a one-room house on Perdido Street with Louis, her {{daughter}} Lucy, and her common-law husband, Tom Lee. They lived next door to Mary Albert's brother Ike and his two sons. After {{dropping out of the}} Fisk School in 1912, Armstrong joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money. He also started to get into trouble. Cornet player Bunk Johnson said he taught Armstrong (then 11) to <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> at Dago Tony's Tonk in New Orleans, although in his later years Armstrong gave the credit to Oliver. Armstrong hardly looked back at his youth as the worst of times but drew inspiration from it instead: [...] "Every time I close my eyes blowing that trumpet of mine—I look right in the heart of good old New Orleans... It has given me something to live for." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Carpenter {{siblings}} {{were both}} born at Grace–New Haven Hospital (now called Yale–New Haven Hospital) in New Haven, Connecticut, to Harold Bertram (November 8, 1908 – October 15, 1988) and Agnes Reuwer (née Tatum, March 5, 1915 – November 10, 1996). Harold {{was born in}} Wuzhou, China, moving to Britain in 1917, and the US in 1921, while Agnes was born {{and grew up in}} Baltimore, Maryland. They married on April 9, 1935; their first child, Richard Lynn, was born on October 15, 1946, while Karen Anne followed on March 2, 1950. Richard was a quiet child who {{spent most of his time}} at home listening to Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, Red Nichols and Spike Jones, and playing the piano. Karen was friendly and outgoing; she liked to play sports, including softball with the neighborhood kids, but still spent a lot of time listening to music. She enjoyed dancing and began ballet and tap classes aged four. [...] Karen and Richard were close, and shared a common interest in music. In particular, they became fans of Les Paul and Mary Ford, whose music featured multiple overdubbed voices and instruments. Richard began piano lessons aged eight, but quickly grew frustrated with the formal direction of the lessons and quit after a year. He had begun to teach himself how to <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> by 11, and resumed studying with a different teacher. He took a greater interest in playing this time, and would frequently practice at home. By age 14, he was interested in performing professionally, and started lessons at Yale School of Music.|$|E
60|$|May 6. A {{good many}} calls this morning. Among others came Miss Greenfield, the (so called) Black Swan. She {{appears to be}} a gentle, amiable, and {{interesting}} young person. She was born the slave of a kind mistress, who gave her every thing but education, and, dying, left her free with a little property. The property she lost by some legal quibble, but had, like others of her race, a passion for music, and could sing and <b>play</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear.</b> A young lady, discovering her taste, gave her a few lessons. She has a most astonishing voice. C. sat down to the piano and played, while she sung. Her voice runs through a compass of three octaves and a fourth. This is four notes more than Malibran's. She sings a most magnificent tenor, with such a breadth and volume of sound that, with your back turned, you could not imagine it to be a woman. While she was there, Mrs. S.C. Hall, of the Irish Sketches, was announced. She is a tall, well-proportioned woman, with a fine color, dark-brown hair, and a cheerful, cordial manner. She brought with her her only daughter, a young girl about fifteen. I told her of Miss Greenfield, and, she took great interest in her, and requested her to sing something for her. C. played the accompaniment, and she sung Old Folks at Home, first in a soprano voice, and then in a tenor or baritone. Mrs. Hall was amazed and delighted, and entered at once into her cause. She said that she would call with me and present her to Sir George Smart, who is {{at the head of the}} queen's musical establishment, and, of course, the acknowledged leader of London musical judgment.|$|E

50|$|Contemporary music pedagogies {{emphasize}} sound before sight, or {{the idea}} {{that in order to}} develop an understanding of music and music notation, individuals must first become comfortable with listening to, singing, and performing tonal and rhythm patterns before reading and writing music. Modern studies by Luce (1965), McPherson (1993, 1995, 2005), and Bernhard (2004) all suggest a significant positive correlation with <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> and the ability to sight read, and experimental research by Haston (2004) and Musco (2006) also suggest that spending classroom time <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> does not negatively impact students' abilities to develop music reading skills.|$|R

40|$|Exploring how western {{classical}} musicians {{could develop}} their aural, improvisatory and creative musicianship skills through <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> {{is an area}} that has recently received noteworthy attention within Higher Education. This article describes a five-week Group Ear Playing (GEP) programme with first year, western classical undergraduate students. Data were collected through students’ weekly reflective logs, end-of-programme feedback forms and interviews. The students reported adopting a variety of learning strategies when they copied music <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> in their groups and particularly when they experimented with the musical material and improvised together. These strategies enhance our understanding of how <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> from recordings within a group setting could promote risk- taking, peer learning and interaction, collaborative playful experimentation and improvisation enabling a lifelong creative practitioner...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> is {{the ability}} of an {{instrumental}} musician to reproduce a piece of music they have heard, without having observed another musician play it or having seen the sheet music notation.

Outside of the Suzuki method, <b>playing</b> <b>by</b> <b>ear</b> is less common in Western Classical music. In this musical tradition, instrumentalists learn new pieces by reading the music notation.
