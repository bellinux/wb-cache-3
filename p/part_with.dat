40|$|The work {{covers the}} {{production}} process of the <b>parts</b> <b>with</b> plasma coating. The aim is to increase manufacture productivity and accuracy of the <b>parts</b> <b>with</b> plasma coating by means of developing the coating layer thickness and shape accuracy control procedures. The mathematical model for forming surface contour of the <b>parts</b> <b>with</b> coatings and the calculation methods of accuracy indices have been developed. The interaction between shape and coating thickness deviations has been determined. The methods for improving production processes of the <b>parts</b> <b>with</b> coatings and also the procedures increasing the treatment productivity have been developed. The manufacture procedures of <b>parts</b> <b>with</b> coatings {{have been used in}} two mechanical engineering works of Altai territory. The requirements to the base treatment accuracy have been decreased 2 times, the service life has been increased by 15 %, the material use coefficient has been increased 1, 4 time.

5|$|After {{multiple}} failures, the Turtle Rock team {{looked for}} a business partner, a company that supported the idea and {{was in need of}} a co-operative shooter to fit into their games lineup. They eventually partnered with THQ for Evolve, which would serve as the game's publisher and help with funding. According to Robb, they had to show the game on their iPad, as they forgot to bring the battery for their laptop. THQ's then president, Danny Bilson and later, Jason Rubin were also excited about the idea. However, at that time, THQ had already entered financial difficulties, suffering from a severe decline in profits. Turtle Rock also knew that THQ had internal problems, but Turtle Rock decided not to <b>part</b> <b>with</b> THQ.|$|E

5|$|Often, castles {{constructed}} {{before the}} age of gunpowder were incapable of using guns as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower <b>part</b> <b>with</b> the rubble to provide a surface for the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle's defences. These could be built from earth or stone and were used to mount weapons.|$|E

All twenty-two cars contested the first <b>part,</b> <b>with</b> seven drivers eliminated from further contention in each of the first two parts of qualifying, leaving eight drivers to compete for pole position in Q3.
