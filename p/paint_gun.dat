50|$|Eugenio Roman, the {{original}} {{organizer of the}} Aperture Tag Team, first began considering <b>paint</b> <b>gun</b> and gel concepts before the Portal 2 game was released and when the gel components of the game were announced.

After playing this precursor, Roman wanted to do more with the aspects of the game, especially the <b>paint</b> <b>gun.</b> The <b>paint</b> <b>gun</b> he ended up using for Aperture Tag was developed by another modder in the community. Roman asked the creator if he could use the device, was approved to do so, and made some modifications before releasing his own map utilizing it.|$|E

50|$|Tag: The Power of Paint is a first-person {{action and}} puzzle hybrid video game. The game was {{developed}} in 2009 for Microsoft Windows by Tag Team, {{a group of students}} from the DigiPen Institute of Technology. The game's core mechanics is the use of a special paint sprayed from the player's <b>paint</b> <b>gun</b> to impart physical properties to surfaces, which, in turn, affect the user's movement. Tag won the Independent Games Festival Student Showcase award in the same year. The project team has since been hired into the Valve Corporation, using the concepts of Tag as new puzzle elements to their game Portal 2.|$|E
50|$|The {{player is}} tasked with {{maneuvering}} through nine different greyscale cityscapes, which serve as platform-oriented puzzles. To solve each puzzle, the player must use a <b>paint</b> <b>gun</b> {{that has the}} capacity for an unlimited quantity of three types of unique surface-altering paint. However, the cans for each paint type must {{be located in the}} level before the player can use that particular color. The earliest to be accessed is the green paint, which allows players to jump on horizontal surfaces, or bounce off of vertical surfaces while still gaining height. The second paint, red, causes the player to rapidly gain momentum. Blue paint, the final type, enables the player to walk on any surface, regardless of whether it is a vertical plane or ceiling. The <b>paint</b> <b>gun</b> also has a removal feature, which erases any paint that has been sprayed down by shooting white paint that come preloaded with the gun and does not require the acquisition of a paint can beforehand to use it. Players are able to use a combination of the paints to help solve the puzzles: the player can coat two sides of a narrow vertical space with green paint to execute a wall jump to climb up, or can lay a path of red paint followed by green paint to create a long-distance jump. The player can only die if they fall off the level, though should this happen they would invariably be revived either {{at the start of the}} level or at the most recent checkpoint touched.|$|E

50|$|A model {{surface is}} painted with the PSP coating with an {{airbrush}} or automotive type <b>paint</b> <b>gun.</b> The PSP {{consists of an}} oxygen sensitive probe suspended in an oxygen permeable binder. The model is then placed in an oven so the PSP layer can cure. Once cured, the model is placed in a wind tunnel or appropriate test environment. LED lamps of a specific wavelength are used to excite the pressure-sensitive probe within the paint. Once excited, the pressure-sensitive probe is transitioned to a higher energy state where is may either emit a photon or be quenched by local oxygen present. This competing process of emission and quenching determines the intensity response of the paint layer. The result is a dimmer fluorescence where there is higher pressure and brighter response at lower pressures. The intensity emitted from the surface is then recorded through a long-pass filter by a CCD or scientific grade camera and stored for conversion to pressure using a previously determined calibration. Images of the paint layer are recorded at three conditions. A wind-off image at a known reference condition which is typically standard atmospheric conditions with the tunnel turned off. A wind-on image at a loaded condition where the wind tunnel is running at condition. And lastly a background image where the ambient light present is captured without the illumination source. The background image is then subtracted from the wind-off reference and the wind-on condition image in data processing. Photographs of the surface {{can be obtained from}} outside the wind tunnel's test section, which means that the model need never be disturbed or touched in order to obtain the pressure distribution. Computer-aided photography can be used to produce false-color images, where the color range corresponds to the pressure variations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method to automate robot motion planning in automotive manufacturing environments. A general framework is developed for CAD-guided robot motion planning. The problem is formulated as a constraint-satisfying problem of tool configurations or, robot hand poses. Two types of robot motion are considered: discrete motion, or {{point to point}} motion, and continuous motion. Triangular facets are used to approximate the part surfaces. A pre-partition process decomposes the complex part surfaces into several simple, easy-to-solve patches. For each patch, robot hand poses are determined to satisfy certain task constraints. In this paper, the approach is applied to two applications: vision sensor planning and spray <b>painting</b> <b>gun</b> path planning. It is out belief that more robot planning applications in manufacturing can benefit from this method. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{a simulation}} study {{relating to the}} design and the implementation of color rescheduling storage (CRS) in an automotive factory. In a painting shop, the colors of vehicles are changed frequently according to the assembly schedule. When {{the color of a}} vehicle is changed, the cleaning process of the <b>painting</b> <b>gun</b> is necessary, which generates a cost. The major objec-tive of CRS is to reduce the changeover cost in the painting process by grouping vehicles with the same color. In this article, a case study of CRS in an automotive factory is presented. The procedure for designing CRS is explained, and the storage/retrieval algorithms are suggested. The proposed system is verified using simulation models, and comparisons among alternatives are examined to determine the best design. The authors also investigate the effect of color distribution on the system performance measures...|$|R
