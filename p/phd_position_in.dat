40|$|I {{have always}} had a fascination for images, be it the impressionistic masterpieces of late 19 th century artists, the beauty of a well {{composed}} photograph or the modern art of computer graphics. In view of this, {{it is not surprising that}} my interest immediately awoke when I, during the pursuit of my Master’s degree in computer science and technology, heard about the course in image analysis given at the Department of Mathematics. This in turn opened my eyes to the subject of mathematics itself and made me realize its value and importance. In the spring of 1998, after focusing my studies in this direction, I presented my Master’s thesis on the subject of multi-scale image analysis based on partial differential equations. With my interest in computer vision and image analysis only escalating during the work on my Master’s thesis, it felt like a natural step to apply for a <b>PhD</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the Mathematical Imaging Group. I received a position in the project “Dynamic Vision...|$|E
40|$|Ab-initio {{electronic}} structure group, Prof. Puschnig We announce a three-year <b>PhD</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> {{the framework of}} the FWF-project "Quantifying photoemission of organic molecular films". This project aims at a fully quantitative description of the angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) cross section of organic molecular films by improving (i) the theoretical description of initial state energies and wave functions, (ii) by incorporating scattering effects in the final state, and (iii) shedding light on the polarization and photon-energy dependence of the photoemission cross section. These goals will be tackled within a team consisting of one PostDoc, two PhDs (one of which is the announced position) and the PI. Moreover, the theoretical developments and simulation results achieved in this project will be closely connected with ARPES experiments to be performed by in-house (Prof. Ramsey) and external collaborations (Prof. Tautz, Jülich; Prof. Schöll, Würzburg). We are looking for a candidate who preferably has a background in theoretical solid state physics, enjoys working in a research team and likes to exchange ideas with colleagues from theory and experimental physics. Conditions: The position is currently available. Salary will be 14 x 2. 024, 90 € / year (before tax) according to the guidelines of the FWF...|$|E

40|$|The proton nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance signal of the His 57 -Asp 102 hydrogen bonded proton in the charge relay system of chymotrypsinogen A and chymotrypsin Aδ has been monitored to {{determine the influence of}} substrate analogues and competitive inhibitors on the electronic state of the active site regions. Borate ion, benzene boronic acid and 2 -phenylethylboronic acid, when bound to chymotrypsin at pH 9. 5 shift the resonance position of the His-Asp hydrogen bonded proton to - 15. 9, - 16. 3 and - 17. 2 parts per million, respectively. These positions are intermediate between the low <b>pH</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the free enzyme of - 18. 0 parts per million and the high <b>pH</b> <b>position</b> of - 14. 9 parts per million. The presence of these analogues prevents the His-Asp proton resonance from titrating in the region of pH 6 to 9. 5. Similar low field shifts are observed for the hydrogen bonded proton resonance of subtilisin BPN’ when complexed with these boronic acids. The results support the chemical and crystallographic data which show that negatively charged tetrahedral adducts of the boronic acid substrate analogues are formed at the active sites of these enzymes. When combined with similar nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} data for the binding of N-acetyl-L-tryptophan to chymotrypsin Aδ, they suggest that a direct interaction occurs between the active site histidine and the atom occupying the leaving group position of the substrate, presumably a hydrogen bond. The His-Asp proton resonance was also monitored in complexes of chymotrypsin Aδ with bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor over the pH range 4 to 9. In the complex the low field proton resonance had a field position of - 14. 9 parts per million over the pH range 4 to 9 indicating that His 57 is in the neutral form, similar to the active enzyme at high pH. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to express my {{gratitude}} {{to all the people}} who supported me for the last four years, while I have been working on my Ph. D. thesis. I {{would like to}} thank Prof. Dr. Daniel Keim, my thesis advisor, for his excellent guidance during my Ph. D. I want to thank him first of all for letting me come to Germany to work in his group, for being there when I needed advice, and for letting (and encouraging) me to work on the topics that interested me most. I am also thankful for his friendship and the unconditional support that he gave me during all these years. I {{would also like to thank}} Prof. Dr. Gonzalo Navarro for his valuable suggestions and constant support. He encouraged me to publish my first paper when I was still an Engineering student at the University of Chile, and later to follow an academic career. He put me in contact with Prof. Dr. Keim and made it possible for me to get my <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>position</b> <b>in</b> Konstanz. He was always willing to discuss interesting topics that helped me tremendously during my ongoing research. Also, he generously accepted to serve as a second referee of my thesis and made useful comments that improved its quality. For all these reasons, I am very grateful to him. I must also offer my thanks to my colleagues and friends at the Universit...|$|R
40|$|Mobility is not {{the only}} way forward In European {{research}} today, mobil-ity has become firmly entrenched as a pre requisite for a successful scientific career; however, the reasons behind this emphasis on scientific nomadism are far from obvious. It is all too common for sci-ence policy-makers and funding bodies to extol the seemingly endless virtues of mobility, but it nearly amounts to heresy to ponder the possibility that a move abroad might also have drawbacks. It was there-fore a breath of fresh air—to those of us who did not change countries the last time we changed jobs—to read Frank Gannon’s recent editorial (Gannon F (2007) The downsides of mobility. EMBO Rep 8 : 201). With a healthy dose of realism, Gannon lays out most of the disadvantages of mov-ing, which, unfortunately, are as obvious as they are neglected. These range from losing out in pension schemes and prop-erty markets to wasting time and energy on re adjusting to foreign administrative systems and social environments. There are still more factors that should dampen the current unrestrained enthusiasm for mobility: possibly serious language-related difficulties for researchers and their fami-lies, loss of support from relatives in rais-ing one’s children and the substantial costs of moving to a foreign country, which are often not reimbursed. Together, these hin-drances can be dramatically vexing to the travelling scientist, to the point of seriously impeding his or her research productivity and career development—the officially proclaimed raison d’être for mobility. All this would be acceptable if research-ers were free to choose whether or not to move. However, this choice is not really free, as mobility is typically either a major advantage or a crucial requirement for com-peting for scarce funding in science. Therefore, a brilliant young scientist mov-ing from, say, a <b>PhD</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> Edinburgh to a postdoctoral position in Cambridge could lose out against an average researcher relocating from Belgium to Luxembourg, bias for ‘interdisciplinarity’, ‘translational research ’ or whatever happens to be the trendiest fad of tomorrow...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of enantioselectivity in the asymmetric Ru-catalyzed metathesis of olefins is investigated with a theoretical approach. The models {{are based on}} the chiral N-heterocyclic (NHC) -based catalysts developed by Grubbs. Our analysis indicates that the origin of enantioselectivity in the ring-closing metathesis of achiral trienes is correlated to the chiral folding of the N-bonded aromatic groups, which is imposed by the <b>Ph</b> groups <b>in</b> <b>positions</b> 4 and 5 of the imidazole ring of the NHC ligand. This chiral folding of the catalyst imposes a chiral orientation around the RudC bond, which, in turn, selects between the two enantiofaces of the substrate. In the ring-closing transition state, the geometry in which additional groups on the forming ring are <b>in</b> pseudoequatorial <b>positions</b> is favored over transition states in which this additional group is <b>in</b> a pseudoaxial <b>position.</b> These combined effects rationalize the enantiomeric excesses experimentally obtained...|$|R
