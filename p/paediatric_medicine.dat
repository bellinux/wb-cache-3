40|$|This {{analysis}} {{examines the}} policy {{issues involved in}} the removal of sugar from <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines.</b> It reports a study which investigates the perspectives of professionals, consumers, and the pharmaceutical industry. Interviews were conducted with: parents of children receiving long term medication, dental professionals involved in influencing policy or caring for such children, and drug companies who produce medication for long term use by children. Results showed that the parent group preferred the tablet over the liquid form of medication; this was also considered acceptable by the key dental professionals interviewed. The removal of sugar from liquid medicine (rather than the alternative use of smaller tablets) was not therefore a policy generally preferred by the groups involved in the issue. It was concluded that the singular concern of the dentist, doctors and pharmacists to remove sugar from liquid <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines</b> was a reflection of their altruistic intentions. The limited biomedical perspective of clinically trained occupations prevented them from exploring the wider issues of the various needs of consumers. Thus, the analysis highlights the problems which have been introduced by professional dominance in the issue of medication caries. sugar medicines dentistry...|$|R

40|$|We {{sought to}} {{understand}} gaps in reporting childhood TB cases among {{public and private}} sector health facilities (dubbed "non-NTP" facilities) outside the network of national TB control programmes, and the resulting impact of under-reporting on estimates of paediatric disease burden and market demand for new medicines. Exploratory assessments were carried out in Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan, reaching a range of facility types in two selected areas of each country. Record reviews and interviews of healthcare providers were carried out to assess numbers of unreported paediatric TB cases, diagnostic pathways followed and treatment regimens prescribed. A total of 985 unreported diagnosed paediatric TB cases were identified over a three month period in 2013 in Indonesia from 64 facilities, 463 in Pakistan from 35 facilities and 24 in Nigeria from 20 facilities. These represent an absolute additional annualised yield to 2013 notifications reported to WHO of 15 % for Indonesia, 2 % for Nigeria and 7 % for Pakistan. Only 12 % of all facilities provided age and sex-disaggregated data. Findings highlight the challenges of confirming childhood TB. Diagnosis patterns in Nigeria highlight a very low suspicion for childhood TB. Providers note the need for <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines</b> aligned to WHO recommendations. This study emphasises the impact of incomplete reporting on the estimation of disease burden and potential market size of <b>paediatric</b> TB <b>medicines.</b> Further studies on "hubs" (facilities treating large numbers of childhood TB cases) will improve {{our understanding of the}} epidemic, support introduction efforts for new treatments and better measure markets for new <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: The 1995 - 2005 {{balance of}} EMEA {{activities}} {{in the field of}} <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines</b> was evaluated, taking into account the number both of drugs authorised for children and paediatric studies supporting the Marketing Authorisation (MA). Methods: Data on drugs authorised by EMEA were extracted from EPARs (European Public Assessment Reports). Active substance, year of approval, anatomical, therapeutic and chemical (ATC) code, indication, orphan status, ages, and registrative clinical studies characteristics were assessed. Results: The percentage of authorised substances for paediatrics is 33. 3 %. This percentage decreased or increased when different subsets of medicines were considered [medicines for children under 2 years (23. 4 %), N-ATC code drugs (6 %) and orphan drugs (46. 4 %) ]. A total of 165 trials were included in the MA dossiers of 51 drugs at the time of approval, and additional 22 studies were added to the dossiers of 12 active substances submitted for paediatric variations. PK and Efficacy/Safety studies were performed for 32 (52 %) active substances, while either one PK or one Efficacy/Safety study was carried out for 43 (69 %) and 45 (73 %) substances, respectively. Conclusions: This report demonstrates that the total number of <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines</b> approved by EMEA is stable over the 10 -year period, while an increase in drugs to treat serious or orphan diseases has been observed. In addition, under the Centralised Procedure, a valuable number of paediatric trials have been submitted to support drug approval. © 2006 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{paediatric}} drug development {{is associated with}} numerous challenges. As a result, {{only a fraction of}} all medicines are licensed for use in children globally. Traditional oralsolid medicines are frequently usedin children, mostly due to their stability, dose uniformity and costs. On the other hand, novel oral dosage forms offer dose flexibility and individualized therapy on the basis of paediatricage groups and inter-individual variations. Such noveloral formulations include mini-tablets, chewable and orodispersibletablets, and dosage forms dispersible into liquids or mixed with food. The inadequate marketing of <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines</b> isof concern especially in countries with limited healthcare budgets, impeding patient access to innovative products with tangible therapeutic benefits...|$|R

40|$|Concern with {{potential}} toxicity {{due to the}} widespread use of unlicensed and off label drugs in children has led to regulatory changes aimed to strengthen the evidence base for paediatric drugs. This thesis examines paediatric randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the highest level of evidence, and assesses them in relation to global child health. 	 A systematic review was performed using validated methods to search three major databases for paediatric RCTs published in 2007. More than 600 RCTs were identified involving more than 100, 000 children. The RCTs appear to study the appropriate clinical areas however few studies involved neonates. The RCTs also seem to be of good methodological quality with a mean Jadad score of 3. 22. The reporting of RCTs that involve both adults and children needs to be improved to add to the evidence base of <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines.</b> More attention is also needed on the reporting of safety information from the RCTs to provide useful toxicity data. Although severe and moderate ADRs were seen in 25 % of the RCTs, few RCTs (12 %) established safety monitoring committees (SMCs). SMCs are vital to ensure patients in paediatric RCTs are protected from toxicity. The burden of childhood disease is heaviest in low and middle income countries (LMIC). A minority of the RCTs were performed in LMIC, although they are increasingly globalised. RCTs conducted in LMIC appear to have lower methodological quality, and reported less well on ethical approval and adverse events. In conclusion high quality, ethical paediatric RCTs should add to the evidence base for <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines.</b> However they should correspond with the health needs of children on a global basis...|$|R
40|$|Children are {{entitled}} to safe, efficacious, and age-appropriate medicines. However, the provision of optimal medicines for children {{is limited by the}} lack of commercial incentives, a dearth of clinical trials on <b>paediatric</b> <b>medicines,</b> delays in licensing medicines for children, and the absence of suitable formulations for children. Children are not small adults, but rather a vulnerable population with specific needs resulting from their changing physiology, who make up a heterogeneous patient group with a scope of diseases different than those of adults, and for whom there is a scarcity of data on appropriate medicines delivery and use. Therefore, these needs are discussed in detail in this background paper; the challenges and opportunities for improvement and further research are also identified. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
