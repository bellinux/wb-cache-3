5000|$|New World monkeys are {{the five}} {{families}} of primates {{that are found}} in the tropical regions of Central and South America and Mexico: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, <b>Pitheciidae,</b> and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Ceboidea, the only extant superfamily in the parvorder Platyrrhini.Platyrhini means flat-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini ("down-nosed," [...] comprising Old World monkeys and apes). New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHere we applied phylogenetically based {{conservation}} analyses using a novel multivariate {{approach to}} better evaluate {{the effects of}} human land use on different primate lineages worldwide. Using a 1 °× 1 ° grid, we obtained information on primate species distribution and the cover of six land use categories (Urban, Village, Cropland, Rangeland, Seminatural and Wild). We synthesized the phylogenetic composition into principal coordinates of phylogenetic structure. We correlated phylogenetic composition and land use in each region, and assessed statistical significance via null model. In America, the Atelidae clade was associated to areas with larger coverage of villages whereas <b>Pitheciidae</b> was found on areas with higher cover of wildlands. Moreover, we found some Atelidae, Callitrichidae and <b>Pitheciidae</b> species {{to be associated with}} seminatural areas, while other Alouatta and Callicebus species were more related with higher coverage of rangelands. In Madagascar, Lemuridae was negatively associated with wild areas. Africa did not show any statistically significant association between clades and land use. Asia had an intense association of some Cercopithecidae species with high coverage of villages. Primate lineages are currently facing different land use pressures, which would imply in the need of clade-specific conservation planning...|$|E

Its distribution limits, especially those to the east and south, remain imprecise. In this paper, based on four independent primate field sampling, we present several new occurrences in the south of the C. cinerascens' geographic distribution. The knowledge of existing primates in this area is entirely absent and these recently discovered populations are under severe threat, since the remaining habitats are highly fragmented due to the historical deforestation rates of this area. The results of this study significantly increased the number of records known to C. cinerascens, indicating a considerable extension of the geographical distribution of this taxon...|$|E
40|$|New World {{primates}} {{feature a}} complex colour vision system. Most species have polymorphic colour vision where males have a dichromatic colour perception and females {{can be either}} ichromatic or trichromatic. The adaptive value of high allelic diversity of opsins, a light sensitive protein, found in primates’ eyes remains unknown. Studies revealing the allelic diversity are important as they shed light on {{our understanding of the}} adaptive value of differences in the colouration of species and their ecologies. Here we investigate the allelic types found in <b>Pitheciidae,</b> an understudied New World primate family, revealing the diversity of medium/long wavelength sensitive opsins both in cryptic and conspicuous species of this primate family. We found five alleles in Cacajao, six in Callicebinae (i. e. Plecturocebus, Cheracebus, and Callicebus), four in Chiropotes, and three in Pithecia, some of them reported for the first time. Both cryptic and conspicuous species in this group presented high allelic diversity...|$|E
40|$|Four DNA {{datasets}} {{were combined}} in tandem (6700 bp) and Maximum parsimony and Neighbor-Joining analyses were performed. The results suggest three groups emerging {{almost at the}} same time: Atelidae, <b>Pitheciidae</b> and Cebidae. The total analysis strongly supports the monophyly of the Cebidae family, grouping Aotus, Cebus and Saimiri with the small callitrichines. In the callitrichines, the data link Cebuela to Callithrix, place Callimico as a sister group of Callithrix/Cebuella, and show Saguinus to be the earliest offshoot of the callitrichines. In the family Pithecidae, Callicebus is the basal genus. Finally, combined molecular data showed congruent branching in the atelid clade, setting up Alouatta as the basal lineage and Brachyteles-Lagothrix as a sister group and the most derived branch. Two major points remain to be clarified in the platyrrhine phylogeny: (i) what is the exact branching pattern of Aotus, Cebus, Saimiri and the small callitrichines, and (ii), which two of these three lineages, pitheciines, atelines or cebids, are more closely related...|$|E
40|$|Orthologous {{sequences}} of six nuclear genes {{were obtained for}} all recognized genera of New World monkeys (Primates: Platyrrhini) and outgroups to evaluate the phylogenetic relationships and to estimate divergence times. Phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed by maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian approaches. All methods resolved with 100 % branch support genus-level relationships, except for the grouping of Aotus as a sister taxa of Cebus and Saimiri, which was supported by low bootstrap percentages and posterior probability. All approaches depict three monophyletic New World monkey families: Atelidae, Cebidae, and Pitheciidae; also within each family, all approaches depict the same branching topology. However, the approaches diVer in depicting the relationships of the three families to one another. Maximum parsimony depicts the Atelidae and Cebidae as sister families next joined by the Pithecii-dae. Conversely, likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic trees group families Atelidae and <b>Pitheciidae</b> together {{to the exclusion of}} Cebidae. Divergence time estimations using both local molecular clock and Bayesian approaches suggest the families diverged from one another over a short period of geological time in the late Oligocene–early Miocene...|$|E
40|$|Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs) {{make very}} useful phylogenetic markers because the {{integration}} of a particular element at a location in the genome is irreversible and of known polarity. These attributes make analysis of SINEs as phylogenetic characters an essentially homoplasy-free aVair. Alu elements are primate-speciWc SINEs {{that make up a}} large portion of the human genome and are also widespread in other primates. Using a combination wet-bench and computational approach we recovered 190 Alu insertions, 183 of which are speciWc to the genomes of nine New World primates. We used these loci to investigate branching order and have produced a cladogram that supports a sister relationship between Atelidae (spider, woolly, and howler monkeys) and Cebidae (marmosets, tamarins, and owl monkeys) and then the joining of this two family clade to <b>Pitheciidae</b> (titi and saki monkeys). The data support these relationships with a homoplasy index of 0. 00. In this study, we report one of the largest applications of SINE elements to phylogenetic analysis to date, and the results provide a robust molecular phylogeny for platyrrhine primates...|$|E
40|$|We studied phylogenetic {{relationships}} of 39 primate species using sequences of the ε-globin gene. For 13 species, we also included flanking sequences 5 ′ of this locus. Parsimony analyses support {{the association of}} tarsiers with the anthropoids. Our analysis of New World monkeys supports the model in which the callitrichines form a clade with Aotus, Cebus, and Saimiri, with Cebus and Saimiri being sister taxa. However, analysis of the 5 ′ flanking sequences did not support grouping the atelines with Callicebus and the pitheciins. Our data support the classification of platyrrhines into three families, Cebidae (consisting of Cebus, Saimiri, Aotus, and the callitrichines; Atelidae—the atelines; and <b>Pitheciidae</b> —Callicebus and the pithiciins. The strepsirhines form well-defined lemuroid and lorisoid clades, with the cheirogaleids (dwarf and mouse lemurs) and Daubentonia (aye-aye) in the lemuroids, and the aye-aye being the most anciently derived. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} nonhuman primates of Madagascar descended from a single lineage. Local molecular clock calculations indicate that the divergence of lemuroid and lorisoid lineages, and the earliest diversification of lemuroids, occurred during the Eocene. The divergence of major lorisoid lineages was probably considerably more recent, possibly near the Miocene–Oligocene boundary. Within hominoids some estimated dates differ somewhat from those found with more extensive noncoding sequences in the β-globin cluster...|$|E

El registro fósil de los platirrinos procede de regiones distantes entre sí, siendo los más antiguos los que proceden del Oligoceno tardío de Bolivia (26 Ma).

Recent {{studies on the}} phylogenetic relationships among the platyrrhine primates based on morphological and molecular data, agree in a taxonomic arrangement of three families: Atelidae, <b>Pitheciidae,</b> and Cebidae, with the only exception of Aotus, alternatively related to cebids or pitheciids depending on molecular or morphological approaches, respectively. The platyrrhine fossil record come from widespread regions, being the oldest the late Oligocene fossils from Bolivia (26 Ma). Fossiliferous strata ranging from the Middle Miocene of La Venta, Colombia, to the early and middle Miocene from Patagonia and Chile are among the richest in producing fossil platyrrhines, represented by 11 genera from La Venta, 8 genera from Argentina, and one genus from Chile. These records come from a temporal span between approximately 12 - 20 Ma, being the oldest those from Patagonia and Chile. La Venta primates are closest to the extant forms. Two additional genera from the Pleistocene of Brazil have been also recovered, as well as three taxa from the late Miocene of Río Acre, Brazil, and four from the Pleistocene and Holocene of the Greater Antilles. Recent estimations on divergence times of the primate phylogeny suggest an age for the crown group Platyrrhini that allows {{the inclusion of the}} Patagonian fossil primates. Another scenario supporting the evolutionary continuity between the Patagonian and Amazonian lineages is a possible paleobiogeographic corridor throughout western South America, considering that by that time the Andean cordillera did not represent a significant geographic barrier to avoid the primate dispersal.

40|$|Conclusive {{evidence}} was provided that gamma 1, the upstream {{of the two}} linked simian gamma-globin loci (5 '-gamma 1 -gamma 2 - 3 '), is a pseudogene in a major group of New World monkeys. Sequence analysis of PCR-amplified genomic fragments of predicted sizes revealed that all extant genera of the platyrrhine family Atelidae [Lagothrix (woolly monkeys), Brachyteles (woolly spider monkeys), Ateles (spider monkeys), and Alouatta (howler monkeys) ] share a large deletion that removed most of exon 2, all of intron 2 and exon 3, {{and much of the}} 3 ' flanking sequence of gamma 1. The fact that two functional gamma-globin genes were not present in early ancestors of the Atelidae (and that gamma 1 was the dispensible gene) suggests that for much or even all of their evolution, platyrrhines have had gamma 2 as the primary fetally expressed gamma-globin gene, in contrast to catarrhines (e. g., humans and chimpanzees) that have gamma 1 as the primary fetally expressed gamma-globin gene. Results from promoter sequences further suggest that all three platyrrhine families (Atelidae, Cebidae, and <b>Pitheciidae)</b> have gamma 2 rather than gamma 1 as their primary fetally expressed gamma-globin gene. The implications of this suggestion were explored in terms of how gene redundancy, regulatory mutations, and distance of each gamma-globin gene from the locus control region were possibly involved in the acquisition and maintenance of fetal, rather than embryonic, expression...|$|E
40|$|Callicebus is a Neotropical primate genus of {{the family}} <b>Pitheciidae,</b> which 27 {{currently}} comprises 34 recognized species. Based on their morphological traits 28 and geographic distribution, these species are currently assigned to five groups: the C. moloch, C. cupreus, C. donacophilus, C. torquatus, and C. 30 personatus groups, although in the past, alternative arrangements have been 31 proposed based on the analysis of morphological data. The principal 32 disagreements among these arrangements {{are related to the}} composition of the 33 C. moloch group. In the present study, we tested the different taxonomic proposals for the C. moloch group, based on the molecular analysis of nuclear 35 markers (Alu insertions and flanking regions) and three mitochondrial genes 36 (16 S, COI and Cyt b), with a total of approximately 7 kb of DNA sequence 37 data. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods indicated that the species of the current C. 39 cupreus group should be reintegrated into the C. moloch group. In addition, 40 our results corroborated previous studies suggesting that the species of the 41 current C. personatus group form a distinct species group. We also observed a 42 relatively subtle level of divergence between C. dubius and C. caligatus. While the known diversity of Callicebus is considerable, these findings 44 indicate that the relationships among groups and species may still not be 45 completely understood, highlighting the need for further research into the 46 biological, geographic and genetic variability of these primates, which will be fundamental to the effective conservation of the genu...|$|E
40|$|The neurohypophysial hormone {{arginine}} vasopressin (AVP) plays {{important roles in}} fluid regulation and vascular resistance. Differences in AVP receptor expression, particularly mediated through variation in the noncoding promoter region of the primary receptor for AVP (AVPR 1 a), {{may play a role}} in social phenotypes, particularly social monogamy, in rodents and humans. Among primates, social monogamy is rare, but is common among New World monkeys (NWM). AVP is a nonapeptide and generally conserved among eutherian mammals, although a recent paper demonstrated that some NWM species possess a novel form of the related neuropeptide hormone, oxytocin. We therefore characterized variation in the AVP and AVPR 1 a genes in 22 species representing every genus in the three major platyrrhine families (Cebidae, Atelidae and <b>Pitheciidae).</b> For AVP, a total of 16 synonymous substitutions were detected in 15 NWM species. No non-synonymous substitutions were noted, hence, AVP is conserved in NWM. By contrast, relative to the human AVPR 1 a, 66 predicted amino acids (AA) substitutions were identified in NWM. The AVPR 1 a N-terminus (ligand binding domain), third intracellular (G-protein binding domain), and C-terminus were variable among species. Complex evolution of AVPR 1 a is also apparent in NWM. A molecular phylogenetic tree inferred from AVPR 1 a coding sequences revealed some consensus taxonomic separation by families, but also a mixed group composed of genera from all three families.

40|$|Specimens {{from wild}} and captive {{primates}} were collected and novel {{members of the}} genus Lymphocryptovirus (subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae) were searched for utilizing PCR for the DNA polymerase gene. Twenty-one novel viruses were detected. Together with previous findings, more than 50 distinct lymphocryptoviruses (LCVs) are now known, with hosts from six primate families (Hominidae, Hylobatidae, Cercopithecidae, Atelidae, Cebidae and <b>Pitheciidae).</b> Further work extended genomic sequences for 25 LCVs to 3. 4 - 7. 4 kbp. Phylogenetic trees were constructed, based on alignments of protein sequences inferred from the LCV genomic data. The LCVs fell into three major clades: Clade A, comprising New World viruses; Clade B, containing both Old World monkey viruses and hominoid viruses including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); and Clade C, containing other hominoid viruses. By comparison with the primate tree, it was proposed that major elements of the LCV tree represented synchronous evolution with host lineages, with the earliest node in both trees being the separation of Old and New World lines, but that some virus lineages originated by interspecies transfer. From comparisons of branch lengths, it was inferred that evolutionary substitution in Clade B has proceeded more slowly than elsewhere in the LCV tree. It was estimated that in Clade B a subclade containing EBV, a gorilla virus and two chimpanzee viruses derived from an Old World monkey LCV line approximately 12 million years ago, and another subclade containing an orang-utan virus and a gibbon virus derived from a macaque LCV line approximately 1. 2 million years ago...|$|E
40|$|Nucleotide {{sequences}} {{were determined}} for the gamma 1 - and gamma 2 -globin loci from {{representatives of the}} seven anciently separated clades in the three extant platyrrhine families (Atelidae, <b>Pitheciidae,</b> and Cebidae). These sequences revealed an evolutionary trend in New World monkeys either to inactivate the gamma 1 gene or to fuse it with the gamma 2 gene, i. e. to have only one functional fetally expressed gamma gene. This trend is clearly evident in six of the seven clades: (i) it occurred in atelids by deletion {{of most of the}} gamma 1 gene in the basal ancestor of this clade; (ii-iv) in pitheciid titi, saki, and cebid capuchin monkeys by potentially debilitating nucleotide substitutions in the proximal CCAAT box of the gamma 1 promoters and (v and vi) in cebid owl and squirrel monkeys by crossovers that fused 5 ' sequence from gamma 1 with 3 ' sequence from gamma 2. In the five clades with gamma 1 and gamma 2 loci separated by intergenic sequences (the fifth clade being the cebid marmosets), the gamma 2 genes retained an unaltered proximal CCAAT motif and their gamma 2 promoters accumulated fewer nucleotide substitutions than did the gamma 1 promoters. Thus, phylogenetic considerations indicate that the stem platyrrhines, ancestral to all New World monkeys, had gamma 2 as the primary fetally expressed gamma gene. A further inference is that when the earlier stem anthropoid gamma gene duplicated, gamma 2 (at its greater downstream distance from epsilon) could evade embryonic activation by the locus control region but could be fetally activated once released by regulatory mutations from fetal repressors...|$|E

Here, we synthesize genetic and biogeographic research from the past several years to construct an overarching hypothesis for platyrrhine evolution. We also highlight continuing controversies in Neotropical primate biogeography, such as whether the location of origin of platyrrhines was Africa or Asia; whether Patagonian fossil primates are stem or crown platyrrhines; and whether cis- and trans-Andean Neotropical primates were subject to vicariance through Andes mountain building, or instead diversified through isolation in mountain valleys after skirting around the Andes on the northwestern coast of South America. We also consider the role of the Amazon River and its major tributaries in shaping platyrrhine biodiversity, and how and when primates from the Amazon reached the Atlantic Forest. A key focus is on primate colonizations and extirpations in Central America, the Andes, and the seasonally dry tropical forests and savannas (such as the Llanos, Caatinga, and Cerrado habitats), all ecosystems that have been understudied up until now for primates. We suggest that most primates currently inhabiting drier open habitats are relatively recent arrivals, having expanded from rainforest habitats in the Pleistocene. We point to the <b>Pitheciidae</b> as the taxonomic group most in need of further phylogenetic and biogeographic research. Additionally, genomic studies on the Platyrrhini are deeply needed and are expected to bring new surprises and insights to the field of Neotropical primate biogeography...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{primates}} {{are among}} the most broadly studied mammalian orders, with the published literature containing extensive analyses of their behavior, physiology, genetics and ecology. The importance of this group in medical and biological research is well appreciated, and explains the numerous molecular phylogenies that have been proposed for most primate families and genera. Composite estimates for the entire order have been infrequently attempted, with the last phylogenetic reconstruction spanning the full range of primate evolutionary relationships having been conducted over a decade ago. Results To estimate the structure and tempo of primate evolutionary history, we employed Bayesian phylogenetic methods to analyze data supermatrices comprising 7 mitochondrial genes (6, 138 nucleotides) from 219 species across 67 genera and 3 nuclear genes (2, 157 nucleotides) from 26 genera. Many taxa were only partially represented, with an average of 3. 95 and 5. 43 mitochondrial genes per species and per genus, respectively, and 2. 23 nuclear genes per genus. Our analyses of mitochondrial DNA place Tarsiiformes as the sister group of Strepsirrhini. Within Haplorrhini, we find support for the primary divergence of <b>Pitheciidae</b> in Platyrrhini, and our results suggest a sister grouping of African and non-African colobines within Colobinae and of Cercopithecini and Papionini within Cercopthecinae. Date estimates for nodes within each family and genus are presented, with estimates for key splits including: Strepsirrhini-Haplorrhini 64 million years ago (MYA), Lemuriformes-Lorisiformes 52 MYA, Platyrrhini-Catarrhini 43 MYA and Cercopithecoidea-Hominoidea 29 MYA. Conclusion We present an up-to-date, comprehensive estimate of the structure and tempo of primate evolutionary history. Although considerable gaps remain in our knowledge of the primate phylogeny, increased data sampling, particularly from nuclear loci, will be able to provide further resolution...|$|E
40|$|Neotropical monkeys {{of the genera}} Cacajao, Chiropotes, and Pithecia (<b>Pitheciidae)</b> are {{considered}} to be highly arboreal, spending most of their time feeding and traveling in the upper canopy. Until now, the use of terrestrial substrates has not been analyzed in detail in this group. Here, we review the frequency of terrestrial use among pitheciin taxa to determine the ecological and social conditions that might lead to such behavior. We collated published and unpublished data from 14 taxa in the three genera. Data were gleaned from 53 published studies (including five on multiple pitheciin genera) and personal communications of unpublished data distributed across 31 localities. Terrestrial activity was reported in 61 % of Pithecia field studies (11 of 18), in 34 % of Chiropotes studies (10 of 29), and 36 % of Cacajao studies (4 of 11). Within Pithecia, terrestrial behavior was more frequently reported in smaller species (e. g. P. pithecia) that are vertical clingers and leapers and make extensive use of the understory than in in the larger bodied canopy dwellers of the western Amazon (e. g. P. irrorata). Terrestrial behavior in Pithecia also occurred more frequently and lasted longer than in Cacajao or Chiropotes. An apparent association was found between flooded habitats and terrestrial activity and there is evidence of the development of a local pattern of terrestrial use in some populations. Seasonal fruit availability also may stimulate terrestrial behavior. Individuals also descended to the ground when visiting mineral licks, escaping predators, and responding to accidents such as a dropped infant. Overall, the results of this review emphasize that terrestrial use is rare among the pitheciins in general and is usually associated with the exploitation of specific resources or habitat types. Am.

40|$|Titi monkeys (Callicebinae; <b>Pitheciidae)</b> are a diverse, species-rich {{group of}} New World {{primates}} with an extensive range across South America. They diverged from their sister clade (Pitheciinae) {{in the early}} Miocene, and thus, they comprise {{one of the oldest}} lineages of extant New World primates. To date, there has been no comprehensive molecular investigation of the phylogenetic relationships among Callicebinae species and, consequently, the evolutionary history of this diverse clade remains poorly studied. The overall goal of this PhD dissertation is, therefore, to provide insight into the evolutionary and biogeographic history of the subfamily Callicebinae using DNA sequence data. To infer phylogeny and estimate divergence times, we generated sequence data for 50 + wild-caught titi monkey specimens using multi-locus Sanger sequencing (22 nuclear and mitochondrial loci, > 14, 500 bp) and reduced representation, genome-wide double-digest restriction-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing. A statistical biogeographical approach was employed to reconstruct the biogeography of Callicebinae and investigate the processes responsible for shaping present day distributions. Furthermore, the ddRAD sequence dataset was used to provide additional insight into phylogenetic relationships and genetic structure among taxa of the moloch group. Our phylogenetic and biogeographic results indicate that titi monkeys are divided into three distinct clades that diverged in the late Miocene through vicariance of a widespread ancestral range. Species relationships were generally recovered with strong support, and species-level diversification in the Amazonian clades was characterised by sequential founder events across river barriers in the Pleistocene. We propose a revised genus-level classification for Callicebinae that recognises three genera (Cheracebus, Callicebus, Plecturocebus) based on the results from the phylogenetic analyses, as well as morphological, karyological and biogeographic evidence. Overall, this study represents a major advance in our understanding of the evolutionary history of this strikingly poorly studied group, with implications for classification and research priorities...|$|E
