The Split <b>Punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>Die</b> techniques introduced is being studied in this paper {{and it is the}} most applicable technique for the lengthy components. Sheet metal parts are widely used in products of high complexity and precision such as vehicles, aircraft and other automobile related products.

50|$|Die {{making is}} a subgenre of tool making {{that focuses on}} making and {{maintaining}} dies. This often includes making punches, dies, steel rule dies, and die sets. Precision is key in die making; <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> must maintain proper clearance to produce parts accurately, and it is often necessary to have die sets machined with tolerances of less than one thousandth of an inch.|$|E
50|$|A die set {{consists}} {{of a set of}} punches (male) and dies (female) which, when pressed together, form a hole in a workpiece (and may also deform the workpiece in some desired manner). The <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> are removable, with the punch being attached to the ram during the punching process. The ram moves up and down in a vertically linear motion, forcing the punch through the material into the die.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, {{technological}} development demands efficiency {{of time and}} energy in all fields {{in order to create a}} product that can compete in the global market. Breakthroughs and innovations are needed merely to survive in manufacturing industry. Punching is the common process of using a cutting <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> in the manufacturing process. A variety of physical phenomena occur in the metal cutting process such as metal flow, friction between the material and tools, process heat and changes in the microstructure of the material. Much research conerning dimensions, tolerances, cutting angles and cutting force has been carried out. This article discusses and examines the relationship between clearance, <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> circularity <b>and</b> circularity of the product of the punching process. Testing has been conducted using various punches with different diameters and different circularity conditions. The Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) which has an accuracy of 1 micron was used to measure the diameter of the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> the <b>dies,</b> the clearance <b>and</b> circularity of the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies,</b> <b>and</b> the resulting product. The question is: is the circularity of the product of punching affected by the clearance or by the circularity of such tools? Keywords- CMM. I...|$|R
40|$|Deep drawing process, one of {{sheet metal}} forming methods, is very useful in {{industrial}} field because of its efficiency. The production of optimal products using this process {{is dependent on the}} process variables such as blank shapes, profile radii of <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die,</b> <b>and</b> formability of materials. Of the variables, the blank shape is very important since it controls the formability factor. This paper reports the investigations on three kinds of blank shapes and the scribed circle test on three deformation modes. The punch load distribution for elliptical forming processes were measured under different conditions of profile radii of <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> <b>and</b> discussed here. These experiments clarified the influence of the profile radii of the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> <b>and</b> the blank shape on the punch-load distribution for the elliptical deep drawing product of automobile parts.

5000|$|Punching is {{performed}} {{by placing the}} sheet of metal stock between a <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> a <b>die</b> mounted in a press. The <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> are made of hardened steel and are the same shape. The punch is sized {{to be a very}} close fit in the die. The press pushes the <b>punch</b> against <b>and</b> into the <b>die</b> with enough force to cut a hole in the stock. In some cases the <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> <b>die</b> [...] "nest" [...] together to create a depression in the stock.

50|$|There are 2 {{types of}} tablet presses: single-punch and rotary tablet presses. Most high speed tablet presses {{take the form}} of a {{rotating}} turret that holds any number of punches. As they rotate around the turret, the punches come into contact with cams which control the punch's vertical position. <b>Punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> are usually custom made for each application, and can be made in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and can be customized with manufacturer codes and scoring lines to make tablets easier to break. Depending on tablet size, shape, material, and press configuration, a typical modern press can produce from 250,000 to over 1,000,000 tablets an hour.|$|E

5000|$|During the 3rd {{millennium}} BC, in the Middle East, {{a variety}} of semi-mass production methods were introduced to avoid repetitive free-hand work. With the simplest technique, sheet gold could be pressed into designs carved in intaglio in stone, bone, metal or even materials such as jet. The gold could be worked into the designs with wood tools or, more commonly, by hammering a wax or lead [...] "force" [...] over it. The alternative to pressing gold sheet into a die is to work it over a design in cameo relief. Here the detail would be greater {{on the back of}} the final design, so some final chasing from the front was often carried out to sharpen the detail. The use of patterned punches dates back to the first half of the 2nd millennium BC, if not far earlier. The simplest patterned punches were produced by loops or scrolls of wire. By Hellenistic times, combined <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> were in use.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} basic types of bending on a press brake, each {{is defined by}} the {{relationship}} of the end tool position to the thickness of the material. These three are Air Bending, Bottoming and Coining. The configuration of the tools for these three types of bending are nearly identical. A die with a long rail form tool with a radiused tip that locates the inside profile of the bend is called a punch. Punches are usually attached to the ram of the machine by clamps and move to produce the bending force. A die with a long rail form tool that has concave or V shaped lengthwise channel that locate the outside profile of the form is called a die. Dies are usually stationary and located under the material on the bed of the machine. Note that some locations do not differentiate between the two different kinds of dies (<b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies.)</b> The other types of bending listed use specially designed tools or machines to perform the work.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{typically}} {{applied to}} printed, published, broadcast, and reproduced materials in contemporary times, all words, letters, symbols, and numbers written alongside the earliest naturalistic drawings by humans {{may be called}} typography. The word, typography, {{is derived from the}} Greek words τύπος typos [...] "form" [...] or [...] "impression" [...] and γράφειν graphein [...] "to write", traces its origins to the first <b>punches</b> <b>and</b> <b>dies</b> used to make seals and currency in ancient times, which ties the concept to printing. The uneven spacing of the impressions on brick stamps found in the Mesopotamian cities of Uruk and Larsa, dating from the second millennium B.C., may be evidence of type, wherein the reuse of identical characters was applied to create cuneiform text. Babylonian cylinder seals were used to create an impression on a surface by rolling the seal on wet clay. Typography also was implemented in the Phaistos Disc, an enigmatic Minoan printed item from Crete, which dates to between 1850 and 1600 B.C. It has been proposed that Roman lead pipe inscriptions were created with movable type printing, but German typographer Herbert Brekle recently dismissed this view.|$|E
