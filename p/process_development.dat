25|$|Twenty {{years were}} allowed to {{construct}} the material and technical bases of communism. In the South, material construction and systemic transformation were to be combined in order to hasten economic integration with the North. It was considered critical for the VCP to improve and extend its involvement in economic affairs {{so that it could}} guide this <b>process.</b> <b>Development</b> plans were to focus equally on agriculture and industry, while initial investment was to favor projects that developed both sectors of the economy. Thus, for example, heavy industry was intended to serve agriculture on the premise that a rapid increase in agricultural production would in turn fund further industrial growth. With this strategy, Vietnamese leaders claimed that the country could bypass the capitalist industrialization stage necessary to prepare for communism.|$|E

2500|$|On January 24, 2002, Agere Systems {{announced}} that it would be closing the [...] Reading Works in 12 to 18 months. The planned changes involved closing the Breinigsville, Pennsylvania plant in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, which was opened in 1988; selling the Orlando plant in Florida; and consolidating several locations in New Jersey. All operations were consolidated at the Allentown, Pennsylvania, headquarters location and the New Jersey locations. About 1,500 workers were transferred from Reading to Allentown where 3,200 workers were employed prior to the relocation. As Agere was leaving, Legerity, Inc., assumed some of the operations formerly done by the Muhlenberg plant in the old Building 10 on North 13th Street. In this facility Legerity assembled 40 former Agere circuit-design, physical-design, application-design and <b>process</b> <b>development</b> engineers to support the analog line card integrated circuit business it purchased from Agere. Legerity is a design facility that uses other companies foundries to manufacture its products. In May 2003, Agere Systems Inc. ended all manufacturing and began decommissioning its Muhlenberg Township plant. The last 346 manufacturing employees were laid off. About 50 employees — mostly maintenance — remained at the plant until a buyer was found.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study and {{understand}} the theoretical model of New Product Design and <b>Development</b> <b>Process</b> and New Product <b>Development</b> <b>Process</b> followed by Automobile Manufacturing Companies in order to understand the similarities and differences between the theoretical model and practical process of New Product Development. Key Concepts The main concepts reviewed in the paper are theoretical “Stage – Gate model” of New Product Design and Development, New Product <b>Development</b> <b>Process</b> followed in automobile industry, role of various departments in the New Product <b>Development</b> <b>Process.</b> Methodology The methodology used to review the concepts exposed in this paper was theoretical research. Conclusion Generic product <b>development</b> <b>process</b> as described by Ulriche & Eppinger sets up overall framework of the product <b>development</b> <b>process</b> but it does not describe the micro-level activities of the new product <b>development</b> <b>process.</b> Whereas the practical process of new product development works out on very micro-level details of the task and activities in new product <b>development</b> <b>process.</b> Generic product <b>development</b> <b>process</b> is a simple framework and hence it is common for any organisation, but actual process of new product design and development is worked out to the very detail level according to functions in an organisation and hence it changes from product to product and organisation to organisation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Process {{management}} systems {{are used in}} many domains to monitor and control <b>processes.</b> <b>Development</b> <b>processes</b> require specific support, which is not provided by conventional workflow systems. On the one hand, they comprise highly dynamic process parts, which cannot be defined until project runtime. On the other hand, <b>development</b> <b>processes</b> may contain subprocesses, which can be executed {{in the form of}} predefined workflows. In this paper we describe the integration of a specialized system for the management of dynamic <b>development</b> <b>processes</b> with a conventional workflow management system. This integrated solution targets the specific needs for the management of engineering design processes in the plant construction domain. It has been implemented as an extension to a commercial CAE-tool, and it will be evaluated in industrial practice in the near future.
