40|$|Indoor {{power line}} {{communication}} (PLC) systems experience high attenuation and frequency-selective channel condition, in addition to different types of colored noises. Its performance is heavily influenced by the length and topology of the in-house power cable wiring. By exploiting the broadcast property of the indoor power grid to each outlet, this paper presents a simple but practical relay-based cooperativecommunication scheme for indoor PLC networks. By plugging a relay device into a third outlet between the transmitter and receiver, reliable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be cooperatively achieved by setting proper system parameters. The condition for the optimal location of the <b>plug-in</b> <b>relay</b> device has been identified. Numerical simulation results show that {{with the cost of}} extra relay device, more reliable performance can be obtained with respect to the conventional direct transmission scheme...|$|E

50|$|Railway {{signalling}} relays {{are large}} considering the mostly small voltages (less than 120 V) and currents (perhaps 100 mA) that they switch. Contacts are widely spaced to prevent flashovers and short circuits {{over a lifetime}} that may exceed fifty years. BR930 series <b>plug-in</b> <b>relays</b> are widely used on railways following British practice. These are 120 mm high, 180 mm deep and 56 mm wide and weigh about 1400 g, and can have up to 16 separate contacts, for example, 12 make and 4 break contacts. Many of these relays come in 12V, 24V and 50V versions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Open Science Grid (OSG) Resource and Service Validation (RSV) project {{provides}} {{solutions to}} several grid fabric monitoring problems, {{while at the}} same time providing a bridge between the OSG operations and monitoring infrastructure of the WLCG (Worldwide LHC Computing Grid) infrastructure. The RSV-based OSG fabric monitoring begins with local resource fabric monitoring, which gives local administrators tools to monitor their status on the OSG using their local monitoring infrastructure. With a set of local grid status probes, the results of which are uploaded to a central collector, a system administrator can monitor and watch their resource locally, while the OSG Operations Center (GOC) can watch from a centralized position. <b>Plug-ins</b> <b>relay</b> RSV results to other popular fabric monitoring software (Nagios) allowing system administrators flexibility to stay aware of their grid status using their chosen status display interface. Additional probes are easily developed and plugged into the RSV structure, and an emphasis is placed on the community to develop additional probes that fit the needs of different categories of users (VO, User, Software Developer) as needed. From the GOC, results are transmitted to a WLCG message broker via a specified format, which can then translate these records into critical statistics to the LHC collaborating projects. RSV has succeeded in meeting these initial goals; future development is centred around usability and extending the project's scope and functionality...|$|R
