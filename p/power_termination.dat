40|$|The CLIC Power Extraction and Transfer Structure (PETS) is {{a passive}} {{microwave}} device in which bunches {{of the drive}} beam interact with the impedance of the periodically loaded waveguide and excite preferentially the synchronous mode. The RF power produced (several hundred MW) is collected at the downstream end of the structure {{by means of the}} Power Extractor and delivered to the main linac structure. The PETS geometry is a result of multiple compromises between beam stability and main linac RF power needs.

40|$|The S-Band loads on {{the current}} SLAC linac RF system were designed, in some cases, 40 + years ago to {{terminate}} 2 - 3 MW peak power into {{a thin layer of}} coated Kanthal material as the high power absorber [1]. The technology of the load design was based on a flame-sprayed Kanthal wire method onto a base material. During SLAC linac upgrades, the 24 MW peak klystrons were replaced by 5045 klystrons with 65 + MW peak output power. Additionally, SLED cavities were introduced and as a result, the peak power in the current RF setup has increased up to 240 MW peak. The problem of reliable RF peak <b>power</b> <b>termination</b> and RF load lifetime required a careful study and adequate solution. Results of our studies and three designs of S-Band RF load for the present SLAC RF linac system is discussed. These designs are based on the use of low conductivity materials...|$|E

In this technique, signal synthesis and signal averaging processes are incorporated to generate a desired impulsive signal from acoustic driver(s) and to eliminate background noise (flow noise) from in-duct and far field signals, respectively. The contribution of higher order modes to incident reflected and transmitted acoustic powers is accounted for by using a modal decomposition process.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. This thesis {{relates to}} the design and {{characterization}} of a 10 kW L-band power combiner consisting of 8 input ports. The design is implemented in a non-radial planar transmission line architecture and operates between 1. 2 and 1. 4 GHz.

Simulated S-parameter models of connector to stripline transitions and a one to four-way junction, as well as measured S-parameter models of high <b>power</b> <b>terminations</b> are incorporated in the final design.

40|$|In {{microsystems}} it {{is necessary}} to rule permanent rising integration densities. So it is in microwave too. There are being originated continually increasing power densities by minimizing sizes. Thick Film Technology is including good chances to solve problems which are compounded with this development. Before known microwave devices (Al_ 2 O_ 3 ceramics) are not suitable to solve these problems because of not sufficient heat conductivity of Al_ 2 O_ 3. So it is aimed in this project to rule these increasing power densities by using ceramics with distinct higher heat conductivity (Aluminium nitride ceramics) and also by developing new special thick film inks. By development of special technologies (printing, firing and resistor trimming of inks) it is possible to benefit these better characteristics of the new material. As a result of this technological development microwave devices were realized (attenuators and <b>power</b> <b>terminations)</b> which have very good microwave characteristics (attenuation and reflexion factor) up to high frequencies (10 GHz). Applications of new microwave devices will be useful in telecommunications and measuring technologies. Needed pieces will be continually rising in next years. (orig.)

40|$|The use of term-rewriting systems (TRSs) is at {{the core}} of {{automated}} theorem proving (ATP). There are a number of methods whereby we can build terminating TRSs with full deduction power, with respect to some theory.

The standard approach to overcome this situation is to use meta-level information; it, however, introduces the problem of finding and capturing such meta-level control. This paper advocates the use of annotated TRSs (ATRSs) for approaching these problems; the annotations are used to capture meta-level information that helps direct proof search, while giving an intuitive account about why and how rewriting is expected to work.

40|$|This Article {{presents}} {{a framework for}} interpreting the constitutional war <b>termination</b> <b>powers</b> of Congress and the President and applies this framework to questions involving how and when the war against Al Qaeda and associated forces could end. Although constitutional theory and practice suggest the validity of congressional actions to initiate war, the issue of Congress’s constitutional role in ending war has received little attention in scholarly debates.

40|$|In [4, 14] we {{presented}} {{an approach to}} prove termination of non-recursive Java Bytecode (JBC) programs automatically. Here, JBC programs are first transformed to finite termination graphs which represent all possible runs of the program. Afterwards, the termination graphs are translated to term rewrite systems (TRSs) such that termination of the resulting TRSs implies termination of the original JBC programs. So in this way, existing techniques and tools from term rewriting {{can be used to}} prove termination of JBC automatically. In this paper, we improve this approach substantially in two ways: (1) We extend it in order to also analyze recursive JBC programs. To this end, one has to represent call stacks of arbitrary size. (2) To handle JBC programs with several methods, we modularize our approach in order to reuse termination graphs and TRSs for the separate methods and to prove termination of the resulting TRS in a modular way.

The sudden growth in mobile telephony market revealed regulatory needs in particular services. The crucial service that regulators mainly focus was Mobile Termination service since it was identified that operators have monopoly <b>power</b> in <b>termination</b> service. By this identification, a debate on whether mobile termination rates need to be regulated arose. This master thesis exemines the debate in detail. Some argue that mobile termination rates are high and high termination rates may cause some market failures. To understand whether mobile termination rates are high, the incentives of the mobile operator: are discussed. Mobile operators have different incentives to set high termination charges for fixed-to-mobile (FTM) and mobile-to-mobile (MTM) calls. Therefore, it is plausible to examine termination issue separately in FTM and MTM markets. The thesis illustrates that while FTM termination rates need to the regulated since incentives are strong, MTM termination charges {{are less likely to be}} regulated. However, termination charges are high not only for FTM, but they are also high for MTM in many countries. Therefore, countries regulate termination rates in both FTM and MTM markets.
