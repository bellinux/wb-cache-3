It determined that Bridgeman's <b>photographs</b> <b>were</b> not original works, and could not be validly copyrighted under U.K. law. It further determined that even if the <b>photographs</b> <b>were</b> copyrightable, no infringement could be deemed to have occurred under U.S. law, because the only way in which Bridgeman's and Corel's <b>photographs</b> <b>were</b> similar was that [...] "both are exact reproductions of public domain works of art," [...] so the only similarity between the two works was an uncopyrightable element: the public domain material itself. Therefore, under well-settled U.S. law, there could be no infringement.|$|R
