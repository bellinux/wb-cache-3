The launch had been delayed nine months, after the British Government ordered that all construction workers be pulled from non-military vessels {{after the start}} of the First World War, and work had been resumed only to make her slipway available for warships. She remained at anchor for the next year and a half. The Royal Navy purchased her on 27 February 1917 for completion as a combined landplane and seaplane carrier. The price of £138,118 included the cost of conversion to her new role. The ship was nearly complete when requisitioned, although her <b>propelling</b> <b>machinery</b> was not yet installed. Consequently, only limited internal modifications, notably the addition of three large workshops, could be made.|$|E

50|$|Between Port-Marly and Bezons, the Seine, {{along its}} length, {{was divided into}} two arms {{by a series of}} islands and earth berms linked {{together}} by timber/rock dikes to form two disconnected, parallel river beds over ten kilometers in length.

The upper pumping relay station (demolished) was located next to the Château des Eaux (1700) and pumped water to the top of the Louveciennes aqueduct, which fed the Louveciennes and Marly reservoirs, near the site of the Château de Marly (demolished).|$|R

60|$|The force {{imprisoned in}} these {{unstable}} compounds may {{be held in}} reserve for an unlimited period, so long as all opportunity is denied them of returning the elements that compose them to their original combinations. Such a case occurs when large beds of vegetable substances are buried under layers of sediment which subsequently become stone, and thus shut the hydrocarbonaceous compounds beneath them from all access to oxygen. The beds of coal thus formed retain their reserved force for periods of immense duration; and when at length the material thus protected is brought to the surface, and made {{to give up its}} treasured power, it manifests its efficiency in driving <b>machinery,</b> <b>propelling</b> trains, heating furnaces, or diffusing warmth and comfort around the family fireside.

40|$|Abstract Recent {{studies of}} aquatic and land plants show that similar {{phenomena}} determine intracellular transport of organelles and vesicles. This suggests that aspects of cell signaling involved in development {{and response to}} external stimuli are conserved across species. The movement of molecular motors along cytoskeletal filaments directly or indirectly entrains the fluid cytosol, driving cyclosis (i. e., cytoplasmic streaming) and affecting gradients of molecular species within the cell, with potentially important metabolic implications as a driving force for cell expansion. Research has shown that myosin XI functions in organelle movement driving cytoplasmic streaming in aquatic and land plants. Despite the conserved cytoskeletal <b>machinery</b> <b>propelling</b> organelle movement among aquatic and land plants, the velocities of cyclosis in plant cells varies according to cell types, developmental stage of the cell, and plant species. Here, we synthesize recent insights into cytoplasmic streaming, molecular gradients, cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics, and expand current cellular models to identify important gaps in current research...|$|R
60|$|The framers were wise {{in their}} {{generation}} {{and wanted to}} do the very best possible to secure their own liberty and independence, and that also of their descendants to the latest days. It is preposterous to suppose that the people of one generation can lay down the best and only rules of government for all who are to come after them, and under unforeseen contingencies. At the time of the framing of our constitution the only physical forces that had been subdued and made to serve man and do his labor, were the currents in the streams and in the air we breathe. Rude <b>machinery,</b> <b>propelled</b> by water power, had been invented; sails to propel ships upon the waters had been set to catch the passing breeze--but the application of stream to propel vessels against both wind and current, and machinery to do all manner of work had not been thought of. The instantaneous transmission of messages around the world by means of electricity would probably at that day have been attributed to witchcraft or a league with the Devil. Immaterial circumstances had changed as greatly as material ones. We could not and ought not to be rigidly bound by the rules laid down under circumstances so different for emergencies so utterly unanticipated. The fathers themselves would have been the first to declare that their prerogatives were not irrevocable. They would surely have resisted secession could they have lived to see the shape it assumed.|$|R

Automation can carry out some tasks far more effectively than men. In other areas it is less effective. For example, the monitoring of machinery operating conditions such as the temperatures and pressures can be carried out by a solid state alarm scanning system at the rate of 400 channels/sec., giving a degree of surveillance which would be impossible by human observation. Conversely, the detection of noisy bearing, a leaky gland or cracked pipe is scarcely possible by automatic means. The balance between the possible and the necessary would be achieved in this case by combining automatic monitoring of all the likely fault conditions, with routine machinery space inspection say twice a day...|$|R
