40|$|International audienceLight-emitting diodes (LEDs), {{based on}} blue-emitting polyfluorenes are usually prone to the {{appearance}} of a contaminant green emission (centered around 520 nm), leading to an apparent whitish light emission. We find that, for LEDs based on poly(9, 9 -dioctylfluorene), PFO, the blending with the hole transporting <b>polyvinylcarbazole,</b> PVK, can suppress such green emission. LEDs based on a PFO/PVK blend with a 1 : 2 weight ratio and with aluminum cathodes show a quite stable blue emission. This result reveals the important role played by the interchain interactions on the observed contaminant green emission. In addition, we observe that in Al-based devices blending causes a decrease in EL efficiency while in Mg-based devices we obtained higher efficiencies with the blend PFO: 3 PVK when comparing with neat PFO-based devices...|$|E

The photoluminescence spectra indicate the presence of both the molecular emitting transitions and the recombination luminescence caused by the electron transfer in the composition of excitons from the matrix to impurity fullerenes. Depending on the content of C₆₀ molecules, the photoluminescence spectra are substantially reconstructed, reflecting the changes in the electron structure of molecular complexes.

Vibrational assignments are presented for the observed frequencies by comparison with similar compounds and also by density functional theoretical calculations. The structure of the monomer and dimer radical cations have been inferred from the RR spectra. It has been observed that Raman bands of the radical cation of PVCz in which the charge is localized on the dimer, undergo a downshift compared to that of N-ethylcarbazole (NEC) dimer radical cation.

Hole injection barriers are determined for interfaces between indium-tin oxide covered substrates with work function ranging from 4. 4 to 4. 7 eV and these two polymers. Vacuum level alignment with flat bands away from the interface is found when the interface hole barrier is 0. 6 eV or larger. Band bending away from the Fermi level occurs when the hole barrier is smaller than 0. 6 eV. This {{is due to the}} accumulation charges at the interface with the polymer when the injection barrier is small.

The polymer PCzSiPh (4) has a wide bandgap and high triplet energy (ET) because of the tetrahedral geometry of the silicon atom in the tetraphenylsilane backbone. The distinct physical properties of good solubility, combined with high thermal and morphological stability give amorphous and homogenous PCzSiPh films by solution processing.

The long-wavelength edge of optical absorption for PVK lies at 365 nm.

Systematic studies of the current versus voltage and light-emitting behavior of the OLEDs have identified different excitation processes for the two dyes. It is suggested that electroluminescence from the FIrpic molecules originates by direct transfer of the exciton energy from the PVK to the dye molecules, while the process of light emission from the Ir(piq) (2) (acac) molecules involves carrier trapping. The efficiency of the devices can be tuned, to some extent, by varying the thickness of the organic film.

Binary mixtures of 3 -methylbutan- 1 -ol and ethyl acetate were used to demonstrate the principle of encoding and decoding different ratios of volatile info-chemicals in this system. The resonant frequencies of the four polymer-coated SAW sensors and the associated reference (uncoated) SAW sensors {{were used to determine}} differential responses corresponding to the different ratiometric mixtures of the info-chemicals.
