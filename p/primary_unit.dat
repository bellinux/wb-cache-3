5|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>unit</b> {{of social}} {{organisation}} in Germanic and Celtic Europe {{of the early}} Middle Ages was the kin group and this was probably the case in early Medieval Scotland. The mention of descent through the female line in the ruling families of the Picts in later sources and the recurrence of leaders clearly from outside of Pictish society, {{has led to the}} conclusion that their system of descent was matrilineal. However, this has been challenged by a number of historians who argue that the clear evidence of awareness of descent through the male line suggests that this more likely to indicate an agnatic system of descent, typical of Celtic societies and common throughout North Britain.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of precursor {{particles in the}} crystallization of zeolites from gelating systems has been studied using X-ray scattering at small angles. The crystallization of Si-MFI using trimethylene-bis(N-hexyl, N-methyl-piperidinium) as the structure-directing agent shows the {{formation of}} two categories of precursors: gel particles and nanometer-scaled <b>primary</b> <b>units.</b> The size of the <b>primary</b> <b>units</b> for the crystallization of Si-MFI {{is found to be}} 2. 8 nm both for gelating and nongelating systems using different structure-directing agents.

40|$|In the 2000 {{redesign}} of the Survey of Income and Program Participation sample, a two-stage sample design is adopted. In the first stage, two geographic <b>Primary</b> Sampling <b>Units</b> are selected {{from each of}} the strata within each state. In selecting <b>Primary</b> Sampling <b>Units,</b> if a <b>Primary</b> Sampling <b>Unit</b> that was in the 1990 design is reselected in 2000, then the experienced field representative in that <b>Primary</b> Sampling <b>Unit</b> can remain working on the survey. If a new <b>Primary</b> Sampling <b>Unit</b> is selected, then a new field representative will have to be hired and trained. Therefore, reselecting as many of the <b>Primary</b> Sampling <b>Units</b> that were in the 1990 design as possible would minimize this turnover of field representatives. This will help reduce nonsampling errors caused by the inexperience of newly hired field representatives and the costs to train them. The Bureau of the Census employs the Ernst (1986) algorithm to select <b>Primary</b> Sampling <b>Units</b> while maximizing the <b>Primary</b> Sampling <b>Unit</b> overlap between the 1990 and 2000 designs. Ernst's approach (1986) is demonstrated on test data for selecting two <b>Primary</b> Sampling <b>Units</b> from each stratum. The test results are reported in this paper...|$|R
5|$|The {{nomination}} in April 2005 {{of a new}} NASA Administrator with an engineering rather than accounting background, Michael D. Griffin, changed the situation, as Griffin stated he would consider a manned servicing mission. Soon after his appointment Griffin authorized Goddard to proceed with preparations for a manned Hubble maintenance flight, saying he would make the final decision after the next two shuttle missions. In October 2006 Griffin gave the final go-ahead, and the 11-day mission by Atlantis was scheduled for October 2008. Hubble's main data-handling unit failed in September 2008, halting all reporting of scientific data until its back-up was brought online on October 25, 2008. Since {{a failure of the}} backup unit would leave the HST helpless, the service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for the <b>primary</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of society}} is obscure {{in the early}} part of the period, for which there are few documentary sources. Kinship probably provided the <b>primary</b> <b>unit</b> of organisation and society was divided between a small aristocracy, whose rationale was based around warfare, a wider group of freemen, who had the right to bear arms and were represented in law codes, above a relatively large body of slaves, who may have lived beside and become clients of their owners. By the thirteenth century there are have sources that allow greater stratification in society to be seen, with layers including the king and a small elite of mormaers above lesser ranks of freemen and what was probably a large group of serfs, particularly in central Scotland. In this period the feudalism introduced under David I meant that baronial lordships began to overlay this system, the English terms earl and thane became widespread. Below the noble ranks were husbandmen with small farms and growing numbers of cottars and gresemen with more modest landholdings.|$|E

But instead of using a base-10 (decimal) scheme like Western numbering, the Long Count days were tallied in a modified base-20 scheme. Thus 0.0.0.1.5 is equal to 25 and 0.0.0.2.0 is equal to 40. As the winal unit resets after only counting to 18, the Long Count consistently uses base-20 only if the tun is considered the <b>primary</b> <b>unit</b> of measurement, not the k'in; with the k'in and winal units being the number of days in the tun.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and consumption of}} nanometer scale precursor particles during the hydrothermal synthesis of Si-TPA-MFI from a clear solution has been studied in situ {{using a combination of}} X-ray scattering techniques and with electron microscpy. The combination of wide-, small-, and ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering allowed us to obtain information on a continuous range of length scales spanning over four orders of magnitude (0. 17 - 6000 nm), covering all particle populations present during the complete course of the crystallization process. The use of high-brilliance synchrotron radiation allows us to perform time-resolved experiments. Two types of precursor particles were observed: 2. 8 nm sized <b>primary</b> <b>units</b> and aggregates (10 nm). Variation of the alkalinity of the synthesis mixture revealed a strong correlation between the concentration of the aggregates and the rate of the crystal nucleation. The presence of the 2. 8 nm sized <b>primary</b> <b>units</b> appears to be independent on the alkalinity. The addition of seed crystals to a synthesis mixture that does not show spontaneous nucleation (no aggregates observed) resulted in normal crystal growth. The size distribution of the growing crystals could be followed in situ by fitting calculated scattering patterns to experimental curves and showed good agreement with electron microscopy results. The apparent activation energy for crystal growth is determined to be 83 kJ/mol by following in situ the crystal growth process at various reaction temperatures. These data show that the formation of aggregates of <b>primary</b> <b>units</b> is an essential step in the nucleation process and suggest that the crystal growth step is the reaction-controlled inclusion of the 2. 8 nm sized <b>primary</b> <b>units</b> at the crystal surface...|$|R
