Arab nations not only refused to have direct trade with Israel (the <b>primary</b> <b>boycott),</b> but they also refused {{to do business with}} any corporation that operated in Israel (secondary boycott), or any corporation that did business with a corporation that did business with Israel (tertiary boycott).|$|E

Syria, Lebanon, and Iran (though not an Arab state) are the only states which actively enforce the <b>primary</b> <b>boycott.</b> The Central Boycott Office has become obsolete. With {{the vast majority of}} Arab states benefiting from trade with Israel, any [...] "boycott" [...] has become symbolic in nature, limited to bureaucratic slights such as passport restrictions.|$|E
2500|$|The Arab-Israeli {{war ended}} on 10 March 1949 with a decisive Israeli victory. On 6 February 1950, King Farouk of Egypt issued a decree under which manifests and cargoes of ships could be searched {{to ensure that}} no [...] "war contraband" [...] was present on vessels bound {{directly}} or indirectly for Israel. War contraband included arms, munitions, and war material. However, article 10 additionally stipulated that other goods were to be considered [...] "contraband" [...] and were to be treated as war material — ships, chemicals, motor vehicles, money, gold, and fuel of any kind. At the time 90% of Israeli oil was supplied by Iran and imported through the Straits of Tiran. To prevent Iranian oil from entering Israel, Egypt blockaded the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba. Oil tankers proceeding through the Suez Canal were required to submit documentation to guarantee none of their cargo would arrive at an Israeli port. To enforce the policy of denying strategic goods to Israel, the decree authorized {{the use of force against}} any ship attempting to avoid search, including live gunfire, to make it submit to inspection. If a ship were to subsequently allow a search and reveal that they were not carrying any [...] "contraband", the ship would be allowed to continue its voyage. However, if the ship resisted a search by force, it would be considered to have violated its neutrality. For this [...] "hostile act", ships were to be seized and their cargo impounded even if they were not found to possess any [...] "contraband". Ships found or suspected to transgress the Egyptian shipping practices delineated in this decree were blacklisted by Egypt and denied free use of the Suez Canal. The decree of February 1950 signaled a shift in the policy of the Arab League. The boycott's immediate purpose had originally been to prevent direct Arab trade with Israel (called a <b>primary</b> <b>boycott).</b> With this decree the boycott was expanded to the interruption of international trade with Israel (a secondary boycott). On 8 April 1950, the Arab League Council embraced this shift, approving a decision by its political committee to the effect that all ships carrying goods or immigrants to Israel were to be blacklisted.|$|E

50|$|Because farm labourers in the United States are {{not covered}} by the Wagner Act, the United Farm Workers union has legally used {{solidarity}} boycotting of grocery store chains to aid to its strikes against California agribusiness and its <b>primary</b> <b>boycotts</b> of California grapes, lettuce and wine. Its secondary boycotts involved asking consumers to stop shopping at a grocery store chain until the chain stopped carrying the boycotted grapes, lettuce, or wine.|$|R
40|$|The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TPA), {{prohibits the}} making of, or the giving effect to, contracts, {{agreements}} or understandings between competitors which purport {{to prevent the}} supply of goods or services to persons. These arrangements are known as exclusionary provisions or <b>primary</b> <b>boycotts.</b> This article discusses {{the role of the}} Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in enforcing the prohibition of the making of exclusionary provisions and the application of the relevant legal principles. An understanding of these principles is important to all those involved in allied health professions. The article further discusses two recent examples where medical practitioners were found to have breached the exclusionary provisions of the TPA by entering into arrangements to boycott bulk billing and restrict the provision of after-hours medical services to patients...|$|R

40|$|Standardised {{tests are}} a common, yet contentious, feature of many countries’ {{schooling}} systems. In May 2010, over one-quarter of English <b>primary</b> schools <b>boycotted</b> that year’s mandatory age eleven standardised tests (colloquially known as SATs tests). This paper investigates the plausibly causal effect {{of participation in}} standardised testing on later end-of-schooling qualification (GCSE) attainment. After controlling for non-random boycott participation, and relying on a selection-on-observables argument, evidence is found of a statistically significant negative effect of boycott participation on various measures of GCSE attainment. Amongst other findings, pupils {{are estimated to be}} 0. 7 per-cent less likely to achieve five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C due to not sitting their age eleven SATs tests. Thus, evidence is found that individual pupils’ subsequent attainment benefits from their own prior participation in standardised tests...|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the Civil War, Amite County's {{population}} was 60% African American. During Reconstruction, freedmen elected several African Americans to local office as county sheriff. After Reconstruction, white Democrats regained power in the state legislature through a combination of violent voter repression and fraud. They disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites in the state by the new 1890 state constitution, which imposed a poll tax, literacy tests, and other requirements as barriers to voter registration. These were administered by whites in a discriminatory way. Most black voters and many poor whites were dropped from the voter rolls. Racial violence, including lynchings, escalated during the Jim Crow years. Discriminatory practices, such as the white <b>primary</b> and economic <b>boycotts,</b> kept blacks excluded from the political process in the county and state until the late 1960s. African Americans were a majority in the state until the 1930s. Excluded from voting, they were also excluded from juries and the entire political system.|$|R
