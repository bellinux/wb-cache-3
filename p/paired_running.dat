50|$|The EuroCity label {{replaced}} the older Trans Europ Express (TEE) name for border-crossing trains in Europe. Whereas TEE services were first-class only, EuroCity trains convey {{first and second}} class coaches. The EuroCity schedule was designed with train <b>pairs</b> <b>running</b> one train in both directions, thus resulting in a more frequent service than the TEE, which normally ran only once a day.|$|R

50|$|As {{an ongoing}} gag of the show, {{one of the}} pair appears {{to be able to}} tell when the other has entered the room, and says their name, before turning round to see them (notably, in the episode Two Faced Dick, in which Dick and Sally swap bodies, Dick enters the room and Don still thinks it is Sally, before turning round to find himself shocked). Another of the <b>pair's</b> <b>running</b> gags is that the conversations held between them are {{somewhat}} dramatic, and reminiscent of an old film noir 1930s crime drama.|$|R
50|$|The 56kbit/s {{speed of}} {{analogue}} modems {{can only be}} achieved {{if there is a}} single digital to analogue conversion in the route from the ISP to the end user. Since DACS involves an additional conversion to digital, and then back to analogue, this means that the maximum possible bitrate over a DACS line is 33.6 kbit/s. Furthermore, many 56 kbit/s modems are unable to successfully negotiate even this speed over a DACS line. DSL broadband internet connections cannot work on a DACS line as they rely on a copper <b>pair</b> <b>running</b> {{all the way to the}} telephone exchange.|$|R

40|$|The {{statistics}} of noise induced in terminal loads of a twisted-wire <b>pair</b> <b>running</b> above ground and illuminated by a random plane-wave spectrum is investigated. Particularly, a previous prediction model is {{extended to the}} practically relevant case of non-ideal loads affected by imbalance, {{which leads to the}} conversion of common-mode into differential-mode (DM) noise. The model is based on a plane-wave integral representation of the field in an ideal reverberation chamber. The statistical distribution of DM-noise voltages induced in terminal loads is derived in closed form and validated versus numerical simulations. It is shown that load imbalance severely increases noise levels in a specified low-frequency range...|$|R

50|$|In pterosaurs, clear {{evidence}} of a similar membrane exists in most fossils that preserve soft tissues. However, the exact extent of this membrane in non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs isn't clear: some authorities consider that it encompassed the tail much like in most bats, while a Sordes specimen {{seems to indicate that}} it involved the hindlimbs to the exclusion of the tail. In the latter case the membrane is referred to as a cruropatagium. Unlike the other wing membranes, cr/uropatagia were fairly simple, generally lacking the specialised tissues like actinofibrils, so they're less well preserved. Meanwhile, in pterodactyloids, the membranes have clearly been reduced, and are instead an independent <b>pair</b> <b>running</b> along the inner side of each leg.|$|R

5000|$|Although their {{multiple}} working abilities {{allowed them}} to control (with a single crew) each other, Class 73, EP multiple unit stock and any blue star coded mainline diesel locomotive, multiple operations were exceptionally rare. Wherever Class 74 was noted with another locomotive, it would invariably be 'dead in-train' - i.e. failed and subsequently rescued. One exception to this were the frequent balancing runs between their home depot of Eastleigh and their day-time out-stations of either Clapham Junction yard or Stewarts Lane depot in readiness for night-time postal and newspaper trains from Waterloo. These were nearly always <b>pairs</b> <b>running</b> light-engine or occasionally combined with empty coaching stock (ECS) moves. With both locomotives under power - over [...] a spirited run was assured.|$|R
5000|$|No {{records of}} any {{confrontations}} {{between the two}} powers are available, but a legend describes how the powers agreed on a border in Libya. Two pairs of champions set out for Carthage and Cyrene on the same day, each <b>pair</b> <b>running</b> towards the other city. When the runners met, the Carthaginian pair had covered more ground. Accused of cheating by the Greeks, they consented to be buried alive on the meeting spot, so that the territory between that spot and Carthage would {{become part of the}} Carthaginian domain. The Carthaginian champions were brothers, called Philaeni, and the border was marked by two pillars called the [...] "Altars of the Philaeni". The African territorial boundary between the Western and Eastern Roman Empires was later set on this spot.|$|R

40|$|The role {{of forces}} in STM image {{formation}} {{has been established}} from studies on copper and nickel, and the resulting potential for controlled atom movement has generated interest in STM imaging of low coverages of halogens on these surfaces. Here we report atom-resolved images of clean and chlorine-covered nickel (110) surfaces over a range of chlorine coverages. All the images show that chlorine dissociates on the (110) surface into chemisorbed atom pairs oriented along the [001] direction. The atom-atom separation {{is comparable to the}} bulk nickel lattice constant. For very low chlorine exposures, strings of chlorine <b>pairs</b> <b>running</b> in the [11 Ì„ 0] direction are observed, propagating from [001] step edges onto the terraces. High exposures of chlorine produce a number of different co-existing reconstructions, which will be discussed...|$|R

50|$|In November 2011 former eFive CEO Mulaudzi {{stated that}} having the first-mover {{advantage}} was vital {{for the project}} {{since there is no}} need for two separate cable systems connecting Angola with Brazil. On Friday, 23 March 2012, the president of Angola Cables, AntÃ³nio Nunes and the president of TelebrÃ¡s, Caio Bonilha, signed a deal to construct a cable of about 6000 km length linking Fortaleza in Brazil with the Angolan capital Luanda named South Atlantic Cable System (SACS). IHS Global Insight lists four concurrent projects to lay new undersea cables between South America and Africa.

50|$|The 550 was {{normally}} {{equipped with}} long, single stepped floats. These were mounted below the engines with four vertical spars per side and braced to the fuselage with a further <b>pair</b> <b>running</b> upwards and inwards. Each float also held the inner {{ends of a}} pair of lift struts which joined the outer section of the wing at about mid-span. Between engine, float and fuselage the bracing was complicated by further diagonal struts. The floats were replaced for a time with a pair of single wheels, contained in a streamlined structure strong enough to allow attachment of the same struts that connected to the floats. In this landplane configuration a small steerable tailwheel was added. The split undercarriage allowed the 550 to launch torpedoes and bombs from a longitudinally divided bay beneath the fuselage, with a maximum weapons weight of 1,500 kg (3,100 lbs) and torpedoes carried on the port side.|$|R
50|$|With a {{total length}} of 35 - 45 cm, the western spotted skunk {{is smaller than}} the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Males, which weigh 336 to 734 g, are {{significantly}} heavier than females, at 227 to 482 g, but only about 6% longer, on average. The adult is boldly striped black and creamy white, with three longitudinal stripes {{on each side of}} the front part of the body, and three vertical stripes on the hind-parts. One pair of longitudinal stripes runs either side of the spine, with the second <b>pair</b> <b>running</b> over the shoulders, and extending forward onto the face. The third pair is lower over the shoulders, and curves downward at the middle of the body to form the first pair of vertical stripes. Behind this, the second pair of vertical stripes rise from the knees to the rump, while the final stripes are often little more than spots.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Web 2. 0 and the {{inexpensive}} cost {{of storage}} have pushed towards {{an exponential growth}} in the volume of collected and produced data. However, the integration of distributed and heterogeneous data sources has become the bottleneck for many applications, and it therefore still largely relies on manual tasks. One of this task, named matching or alignment, is the discovery of correspondences, i. e., semantically-equivalent elements in different data sources. Most approaches which attempt to solve this challenge face the issue of deciding whether a pair of elements is a correspondence or not, given the similarity value(s) computed for this pair. In this paper, we propose a generic and flexible framework for selecting the correspondences by relying on the discriminative similarity values for a <b>pair.</b> <b>Running</b> experiments on a public dataset has demonstrated the im-provment in terms of quality and the robustness for adding new similarity measures without user intervention for tuning...|$|R
50|$|Pennsylvania Route 3 (PA 3) is a 24.3 mi {{state highway}} {{located in the}} southeastern portion of Pennsylvania. The route connects U.S. Route 322 Business (US 322 Bus.) in West Chester with PA 611 in Philadelphia. The route begins in {{downtown}} West Chester and heads east out of town as a one-way pair of streets. Between West Chester and Upper Darby Township, PA 3 follows a four-lane divided highway known as West Chester Pike through suburban areas. Along this stretch, the route passes through Edgmont, Newtown Square, Broomall, and Havertown. The route has an interchange with Interstate 476 (I-476) between Broomall and Havertown. Upon reaching Upper Darby, PA 3 heads into Philadelphia along Market Street. In Philadelphia, the route follows multiple one-way <b>pairs,</b> <b>running</b> along Chestnut Street and Walnut Street in West Philadelphia before heading into Center City Philadelphia along Market Street and John F.
