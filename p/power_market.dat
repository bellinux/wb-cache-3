Fargo advised the Foote {{brothers}} about possible hydropower locations on the Muskegon River, which has the second largest outflow of an inland (non Great Lakes connecting) river of Michigan after the Grand River (which has a larger basin and the largest outflow of Michigan's inland rivers). Unlike the Grand, the Muskegon is not navigable, so dams would not cause difficulty with river traffic. Through a subsidiary of their holding company, Commonwealth Power, the Grand Rapids – Muskegon Power Company, in 1904 they commissioned the construction of Rogers Dam and Croton Dam on the Muskegon, as well as Webber Dam on the Grand River. [...] Rogers, upstream of the Croton, was finished first, in 1906, but Croton, located where the Little Muskegon joins from the east, was a more ambitious project. One third of the village of Croton would be submerged by the impoundment lake as it began filling in August 1907. William D. Fargo was dispatched to oversee construction and served as the Chief Engineer.|$|E

An MC firm can raise its prices without losing all its customers. The firm can also lower prices without triggering a potentially ruinous price war with competitors. The source of an MC firm's market power is not barriers to entry since they are low.

Market power also means that an MC firm faces a downward sloping demand curve. The demand curve is highly elastic although not [...] "flat".|$|E
2500|$|Since the Second World War, {{scientific}} and technical progress {{and the removal of}} tenancy-based restrictions on choice of crop have given British arable farmers a great deal more freedom to plan cropping sequences. [...] Strict crop rotation is no longer technically necessary or even financially desirable. [...] Factors that influence crop sequences include the soil type, weather, the price and availability of labour and <b>power,</b> <b>market</b> outlets, and technical considerations about maintaining soil fertility and crop health. [...] For example, some vigorous crops such as kale or arable silage will, when liberally fertilised, tend to outgrow and smother weeds. [...] Many pests and diseases are crop-specific and the more often a particular crop is taken, the greater the buildup of pests and diseases that attack it. [...] The farmer will therefore try to design a sequence to sustain high yields, permit adequate weed control, service market needs, and keep the soil free from diseases and pests.|$|E

40|$|<b>Power</b> <b>marketing</b> {{refers to}} {{wholesale}} and retail transactions of electric power made by companies other than public power entities and the regulated utilities that own the generation and distribution lines. The growth in <b>power</b> <b>marketing</b> {{has been a}} major development in the electric power industry during the last few years, and power marketers are expected to realize even more market opportunities as electric industry deregulation proceeds from wholesale competition to retail competition. This Topical Issues Brief examines the nature of the <b>power</b> <b>marketing</b> business and its relationship with renewable power. The information presented is based on interviews conducted with nine <b>power</b> <b>marketing</b> companies, which accounted for almost 54 % of total power sales by power marketers in 1995. These interviews provided information on various viewpoints of power marketers, their experience with renewables, and their respective outlooks for including renewables in their resource portfolios. Some basic differences exist between wholesale and retail competition that should be recognized when discussing <b>power</b> <b>marketing</b> and renewable <b>power.</b> At the wholesale level, the majority of power marketers stress the commodity nature of electricity. The primary criteria for developing resource portfolios are the same as those of their wholesale customers: the cost and reliability of power supplies. At the retail level, electricity may be viewed as a product that includes value-added characteristics or services determined by customer preferences...|$|R

A reactive power optimization model along with a power flow tracing based method is proposed in this article to tackle this problem.
