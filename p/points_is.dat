5|$|Immersed curves on Riemannian manifolds, with finitely many self-crossings, become self-tangent {{only at a}} {{discrete}} set of times, at each of which they lose a crossing. As a consequence the number of self-crossing <b>points</b> <b>is</b> non-decreasing.|$|E
5|$|Domination: Two teams {{compete to}} control various control points to earn points. Standard maps contain three control points. Control of these <b>points</b> <b>is</b> {{initially}} accomplished through occupation (physically occupying the space), but {{control of a}} point continues until a player from another team occupies the space. The first team to reach the point limit, or that has the most points when a time limit has expired, wins.|$|E

If someone joins as the second in their direct family to do so, they are put in the same house as their relative. There are inter-house competitions throughout the year (including rugby, hockey, reading, and chess) and then {{at the end of the}} year the points awarded in each event throughout the year are added up, and the house with most <b>points</b> <b>is</b> awarded the Cock House Cup, which is the traditional name given in British public schools for the in-school competition cup.|$|E

Points are awarded for knocking opponents {{off one of the}} three available arenas, with more points being awarded when the player currently in the lead is knocked off. The player with the most <b>points</b> <b>is</b> declared the winner of a round when the in-game timer reaches zero. Items can be used to extend the reach, size, and strength of one's boxing glove.|$|E
5|$|NY326 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York as a connector highway between Union Springs and Auburn. However, its original alignment followed Oakwood Road and Genesee Street from the hamlet of Oakwood to downtown Auburn. It was realigned in the mid-1970s to end at US20 and NY5 west of downtown Auburn. In 1981, NY326 was rerouted between the hamlets of Oakwood and Half Acre to follow Half Acre Road. NY326's former routing between the two <b>points</b> <b>is</b> now maintained by Cayuga County.|$|E

5|$|Similarly to all inner {{satellites}} of Jupiter, Thebe rotates synchronously {{with its}} orbital motion, thus keeping one face always {{looking toward the}} planet. Its orientation is such that the long axis always points to Jupiter. At the surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter, the surface {{is thought to be}} {{near the edge of the}} Roche lobe, where Thebe's gravity is only slightly larger than the centrifugal force. As a result, the escape velocity in these two <b>points</b> <b>is</b> very small, thus allowing dust to escape easily after meteorite impacts, and ejecting it into the Thebe gossamer ring.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-five songs {{have won}} the Eurovision Song Contest, an annual {{competition}} organised by member countries of the European Broadcasting Union. The contest, which has been broadcast every year since its debut in 1956, {{is one of the}} longest-running television programmes in the world. The contest's winner has been determined using numerous voting techniques throughout its history; centre to these have been the awarding of points to countries by juries or televoters. The country awarded the most <b>points</b> <b>is</b> declared the winner. The first Eurovision Song Contest was not won on points, but by votes (two per country), and only the winner was announced.|$|E
5|$|The combativity {{classification}} {{is based}} on points won at intermediate sprints and classified climbs along the route.

2500|$|A turning <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a <b>point</b> {{at which}} the {{derivative}} changes sign. A turning <b>point</b> may <b>be</b> either a relative maximum or a relative minimum (also known as local minimum and maximum). If the function is differentiable, then a turning <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a stationary point; however not all stationary <b>points</b> <b>are</b> turning <b>points.</b> If the function is twice differentiable, the stationary <b>points</b> that <b>are</b> not turning <b>points</b> <b>are</b> horizontal inflection <b>points.</b> For example, the function [...] has a stationary point at x=0, which is also an inflection <b>point,</b> but <b>is</b> not a turning point.|$|R

5|$|The fair catch kick is a rule at the {{professional}} and high school levels of American football that allows {{a team that has}} just made a fair catch to attempt a free kick from the spot of the catch. The kick must be either a place kick or a drop kick, and if it passes over the crossbar and between the goalposts of the defensive team's goal, a field goal, worth three <b>points,</b> <b>is</b> scored to the offensive team.|$|E
5|$|The {{total of}} the round points the player (or pair) has gained is {{calculated}} as the sum of values of the cards collected in the baza and {{the values of the}} declared combinations.

5|$|The {{touchdown}} (TD), worth six <b>points,</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} valuable scoring play in American football. A touchdown is scored when a live ball is advanced into, caught in, or recovered {{in the end zone}} of the opposing team. The scoring team then attempts a try or conversion, more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT), which is a single scoring opportunity.|$|E

5|$|Every so often, {{the player}} {{will come to}} a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. The time between these <b>points</b> <b>is</b> variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The plot lines carry on from each other in a linear fashion. The game can end prematurely if the player makes the wrong decisions. When this occurs, the player must go back to a previously saved spot and choose different decisions.|$|E
5|$|Five <b>Points</b> <b>is</b> a small {{commercial}} district {{centered on}} {{and around the}} five-way intersection between Park, Lomax, and Margaret Streets. The area was originally residential, but transitioned to commercial uses after World War I and several retail buildings were constructed. The Park Arcade Building, an Italian Renaissance revival structure with storefronts marked by variant rooflines, set the architectural tone for the district when it was completed in 1928. Other notable features include Sun-Ray Cinema, formerly Riverside Theater, which opened in 1927 as the first movie theater in Florida equipped to show talking pictures. Over the last several decades, Five Points has become known for its edgy, bohemian character and many independent shops, restaurants and businesses.|$|E
5|$|In the Adventure Mode, the {{characters}} {{compete in a}} race for the Super Big Power Crystal. This race {{is made up of}} six stages, each containing smaller sub-maps. The host of the race, the Viscount, sets a task for each stage. This task must be completed before the player can continue to another map. The player with the most <b>points</b> <b>is</b> the winner of the stage. The overall winner of all the stages is the winner of the Viscount's race. In the Festival Mode, the gameplay is fundamentally the same as in the Adventure Mode, {{with the exception of the}} ability to select stages to play freely. In the My Room mode, the player's character has his or her own private room in which he or she can either play minigames that have been collected in Adventure Mode, view a collection of items obtained in Adventure Mode, or create a Motion Panel, a unique in-game communication tool can allow customized messages to be sent mid-game to help friends or distract other players' gameplay.
