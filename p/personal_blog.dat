40|$|Blogging {{has been}} {{established}} as a potential source for reflection. Previous researches done {{on the relationship between}} blogging and reflective writing focused more on classroom blogs monitored by the teachers. Studies on the relationship between <b>personal</b> <b>blogs</b> and reflective writing are still relatively scarce, especially in Malaysian context. Thus, the present exploratory study investigated on the bloggers’ perception of blogging and looked into how <b>personal</b> <b>blogs</b> affect students’ abilities to become reflective writer. The study also explored the strengths of blogging in developing reflective writers. Two types of instruments namely document analysis and semi-structured interview were used on three respondents selected through nonpurposive random sampling. The conceptual framework for the present study was conceptualized based on previous researches done on the relationship between blogs and reflective learning mainly from Scaletta (2006) and Quinn et. al (2007). Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987) ’s characteristics of mature writers and knowledge transforming model, Flower and Hayes (1983) ’s and Graham and Harris (1989) ’s novice vs. expert writer characteristics were used to extract the themes for the findings of the study. The findings indicated that bloggers viewed blogging as a place for self-reflection and their interests in writing contributed to the reasons why they started blogging in the first place. The data analysis from the respondents’ <b>personal</b> <b>blogs</b> also conformed {{to the fact that the}} respondents featured the characteristics of reflective writers when writing their blog entries. From the previous two findings, the researcher managed to identify the strengths of <b>personal</b> <b>blogs</b> in developing reflective writers. In conclusion, despite the informal and interpersonal nature of <b>personal</b> <b>blogs,</b> this study provided evidence that <b>personal</b> <b>blogs</b> also contributed to the development of reflective writers...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we analyze some {{controversial}} {{aspects of}} blogging and the blogosphere {{from the perspective}} of privacy. In particular, we focus on Helen Nissenbaum’s theory of privacy as “contextual integrity ” and apply it to <b>personal</b> <b>blogs,</b> in general, and the case of the “Washingtonienne ” blogger, in particular. We examine the question of whether <b>personal</b> <b>blogs</b> that are not password protected can be considered “normatively private contexts ” according to Nissenbaum’s principles of privacy. We argue that they cannot. Using Nissenbaum’s original model, we conclude that privacy expectations for those who disclose personal information in such blogs are unrealistic. We also suggest that Nissenbaum’s expanded theory (see Nissenbaum, 2010) can inform the contemporary debate about privacy and blogging {{in a wide variety of}} newer technological contexts, in addition to <b>personal</b> <b>blogs,</b> and we encourage researchers to apply Nissenbaum’s model in those contexts...|$|R
40|$|As {{traditional}} {{advertising is}} losing its value in corporations’ marketing, new and growing social media marketing channels are increasing their importance. The growing interest {{in the media and}} the lack of research on the subject create a clear need for this study. The objectives are to increase understanding about product placement in <b>personal</b> <b>blogs</b> and examine the benefits as well as the downsides created by this marketing channel and present the requirements for success. The study also takes a stand on what kind of things a successful product placement strategy in <b>personal</b> <b>blogs</b> includes and what points should be considered when creating a strategy. The study’s empirical part consists of seven thematic interviews with case companies’ representatives and one agent. The study’s <b>personal</b> <b>blogs</b> were delimited to consist only lifestyle and fashion blogs. The results show that product placement on personal lifestyle and fashion blogs is a strongly growing marketing channel and it is best suited to reach young women. It is also a very good channel to change and improve brand image. Via <b>personal</b> <b>blogs</b> it is possible to reach a large number of consumers with a very cost-efficient manner. Thus utilizing the channel is suitable for all companies regardless {{of the size of the}} marketing budget. Of course, companies have to consider the suitability of their product to the themes of blogs. Executing a successful campaign in this media requires good relationship management skills and understanding of this particular media as the final content is not in advertiser’s hands. As a marketing channel, <b>personal</b> <b>blogs</b> differ highly from traditional marketing channels because of their constantly changing nature and multidirectional quality where several parties are in interaction...|$|R
