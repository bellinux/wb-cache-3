40|$|Human {{rhinovirus}} 14 is {{a member}} of picornavirus family and belongs to the rhinovirus genus that includes several serotypes causing common cold. Capsid stability {{plays an important role in}} the viral infection process. Hypothetical ‘pocket factors’ have been suggested to play an important role by providing transient stability to the members of picornavirus family. Interestingly, anti-viral WIN compounds that bind in the same hydrophobic pocket region as the ‘pocket factors’ inhibit capsid uncoating. Further, capsid-breathing experiments clearly demonstrated the importance of the empty pocket to facilitate capsid dynamics that lead to uncoating. To better understand the relevance of the hypothetical ‘pocket factors’ and to study the effect of filling the hydrophobic pocket on capsid breathing, HRV 14 mutants, with mutations in (HRV 14 /V 1188 M/C 1199 W, HRV 14 /V 1188 M, and HRV 14 /C 1199 W) and around (HRV 14 /S 1223 G) the hydrophobic pocket region have been studied. Mutations that fill the hydrophobic <b>pocket,</b> <b>block</b> binding of the WIN compounds and hence block the binding of pocket factors, are viable and behave as wild type virus. They provide evidence suggesting that pocket factors are not essential in the viral life cycle. These results are supported by the studies on HRV 14 /S 1223 G to which WIN compounds bind without affecting infectivity. Transient and reversible exposure of the N-termini of VP 1 and VP 4 has been shown from the capsid breathing studies. However, the site of protrusion of these termini from the capsid is not known. Towards this end, antibodies against the peptides representing these termini have been raised and their ability to bind and neutralize HRV 14 infectivity studied. VP 4 antiserum shows the ability to form complexes with the virions and also demonstrates a dose and time dependent neutralization of HRV 14 infectivity. Furthermore, anti-VP 4 serum cross-reacts with other rhinovirus serotypes, HRV 16, HRV 3 and HRV 29. Sequence analysis shows a high degree of sequence conservation in VP 4 peptide among all the 3 ̆e 100 serotypes, suggesting the possibility of using VP 4 to develop a peptide based vaccine against rhinoviruses. Using an alternate approach, complexes of monomaleimido nanogold bound to N-termini of VP 1 and VP 4, locking the virus particle in an intermediate state of ‘breathing’ have been obtained. Preliminary reconstruction of this complex suggests two possible sites on the capsid from where these termini exit. ...|$|E

Although there are many known histone methyltransferases, their regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we present the crystal structure of the human ASH 1 L catalytic domain, showing its substrate binding <b>pocket</b> <b>blocked</b> by a loop from the post-SET domain. In this configuration, the loop limits substrate access to the active site. Mutagenesis of the loop stimulates ASH 1 L histone methyltransferase activity, suggesting that ASH 1 L activity may be regulated through the loop from the post-SET domain.

40|$|AbstractWe present {{evidence}} that phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of Rb by Cdk 4 / 6 initiates successive intramolecular {{interactions between the}} C-terminal region and the central pocket. The initial interaction displaces histone deacetylase from the <b>pocket,</b> <b>blocking</b> active transcriptional repression by Rb. This facilitates a second interaction that leads to phosphorylation of the pocket by Cdk 2 and disruption of pocket structure. These intramolecular interactions provide a molecular basis for sequential phosphorylation of Rb by Cdk 4 / 6 and Cdk 2. Cdk 4 / 6 is activated early in G 1, blocking active repression by Rb.

Here, crystal structures of a chimaeric PDE 5 /PDE 6 catalytic domain (PDE 5 / 6 cd) complexed with sildenafil or 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine and the Pγ-inhibitory peptide Pγ 70 − 87 have been determined at 2. 9 and 3. 0 Å, respectively. These structures show the determinants and {{the mechanism of}} the PDE 6 inhibition by Pγ and suggest the conformational change of Pγ on transducin activation. Two variable H- and M-loops of PDE 5 / 6 cd form a distinct interface {{that contributes to the}} Pγ-binding site. This allows the Pγ C-terminus to fit into the opening of the catalytic <b>pocket,</b> <b>blocking</b> cGMP access to the active site. Our analysis suggests that disruption of the H–M loop interface and Pγ-binding site is a molecular cause of retinal degeneration in atrd 3 mice. Comparison of the two PDE 5 / 6 cd structures shows an overlap between the sildenafil and Pγ 70 − 87 -binding sites, thereby providing critical insights into the side effects of PDE 5 inhibitors on vision...|$|R
50|$|NNRTIs do not bind to {{the active}} {{site of the}} {{polymerase}} but in a less conserved pocket near the active site in the p66 subdomain. Their binding results in a conformational change in the reverse transcriptase that distorts the positioning of the residues that bind DNA, inhibiting polymerization. Mutations in response to NNRTIs decrease the binding of the drug to this pocket. Treatment with a regimen including efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP) typically results in mutations L100I, Y181C/I, K103N, V106A/M, V108I, Y188C/H/L and G190A/S.There are three main mechanisms of NNRTI resistance. In the first NRTI mutations disrupt specific contacts between the inhibitor and the NNRTI binding pocket. An {{example of this is}} K103N and K101E which sit at the entrance of the <b>pocket,</b> <b>blocking</b> the entrance/binding of the drug. A second mechanism is the disruption of important interactions {{on the inside of the}} pocket. For example, Y181C and Y188L result in the loss of important aromatic rings involved in NNRTI binding. The third type of mutations result in changes in the overall conformation or the size of the NNRTI binding pocket. An example is G190E, which creates a steric bulk in the pocket, leaving little or no room for an NNRTI to tightly bind.|$|R

Unlike other proteins that contain a SET domain at their C terminus, ASH1L has a SET domain {{in the middle of}} the protein. The crystal structure of the human ASH1L catalytic domain, including the AWS, SET, and post-SET domains, has been solved to 2.9 angstrom resolution. The structure shows that the substrate binding <b>pocket</b> is <b>blocked</b> by a loop from the post-SET domain, and because mutation of the loop stimulates ASH1L HMTase activity, it was proposed that this loop serves a regulatory role.|$|R

Despite its importance, the molecular events underlying the parasite’s commitment to invasion are not well understood. Here we show that the interaction of two parasite proteins, RON 2 and AMA 1, known to be critical for invasion, is essential to trigger junction formation. Using antibodies (Abs) that bind near the hydrophobic pocket of AMA 1 and AMA 1 mutated in the pocket, we identified RON 2 ’s binding site on AMA 1. Abs specific for the AMA 1 <b>pocket</b> <b>blocked</b> junction formation and the induction of the parasitophorous vacuole. We also identified the critical residues in the RON 2 peptide (previously shown to bind AMA 1) that are required for binding to the AMA 1 pocket, namely, two conserved, disulfide-linked cysteines. The RON 2 peptide blocked junction formation but, unlike the AMA 1 -specific Ab, did not block formation of the parasitophorous vacuole, indicating that formation of the junction and parasitophorous vacuole are molecularly distinct steps in the invasion process. Collectively, these results identify the binding of RON 2 to the hydrophobic pocket of AMA 1 as the step that commits Plasmodium merozoites to RBC invasion and point to RON 2 as a potential vaccine candidate...|$|R

40|$|Proteases act in {{important}} homeostatic pathways and are tightly regulated. Here, we report an unusual structural mechanism of regulation observed by the 2. 5 -Å X-ray crystal {{structure of the}} serine protease, granzyme C. Although the active-site triad residues adopt canonical conformations, the oxyanion hole is improperly formed, {{and access to the}} primary specificity (S 1) <b>pocket</b> is <b>blocked</b> through a reversible rearrangement involving Phe- 191. Specifically, a register shift in the 190 -strand preceding the active-site serine leads to Phe- 191 filling the S 1 pocket. Mutation of a unique Glu–Glu motif at positions 192 – 193 unlocks the enzyme, which displays chymase activity, and proteomic analysis confirms that activity of the wild-type protease can be released through interactions with an appropriate substrate. The 2. 5 -Å structure of the unlocked enzyme reveals unprecedented flexibility in the 190 -strand preceding the active-site serine that results in Phe- 191 vacating the S 1 pocket. Overall, these observations describe a broadly applicable mechanism of protease regulation that cannot be predicted by template-based modeling or bioinformatic approaches alone...|$|R

BRI 1 is conserved among dicot and monocot species; however, the molecular mechanism underlying BR perception in monocots is not fully understood. We synthesised two BRs, iso-carbabrassinolide (iso-carbaBL) and 6 -deoxoBL, which have different BR activities in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) and rice. Our bioassay indicated that iso-carbaBL has relatively strong BR activity in Arabidopsis, but is inactive in rice and competitively inhibits BR activity. The bioactivity of 6 -deoxoBL {{was similar to that}} of BL in Arabidopsis, but was much lower in rice. Binding experiments using recombinant Arabidopsis and rice BRI 1 protein fragments suggested that iso-carbaBL and 6 -deoxoBL bind to both receptors. These results showed that iso-carbaBL and 6 -deoxoBL act as an antagonist and agonist, respectively, of BRs in rice. A docking simulation analysis suggested that iso-carbaBL fits deeper in the binding <b>pocket</b> to <b>block</b> the binding of active BR to rice BRI 1. The simulated binding energy of 6 -deoxoBL with rice BRI 1 is much lower than that with Arabidopsis BRI 1.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of the fibrin network {{in the presence of}} unaltered and PEGylated fibrin knob peptides is unknown. Fibrinogen, the principle protein investigated, participates in the coagulation cascade during hemostasis. Once activated by thrombin, it is converted to fibrin, which catalyzes Factor XIII to create a covalently cross-linked network. Fibrin knob peptides bind to the fibrin <b>pockets</b> and <b>block</b> polymerization, altering the mechanical properties of the resulting network. This study focuses on visualizing and analyzing confocal microscopy images to coordinate fibrin structure in the presence of peptides during polymerization. Using self-prepared and treated PDMS microfluidic devices, the solutions are mixed, injected, and imaged in real-time. The data is evaluated based on the calculated gel area fractions from 3 D-rendered confocal images. The growth rates and maximal area of the fibrin networks are quantified and compared among the image sets. Data is used to predict how peptides alter the structure, development, and rate of fibrin network formation. Qualitatively, the incorporation of peptides into the fibrin matrix provides thicker fibers at lower overall network densities as compared to the control. The results show that fibrin knob peptides decrease the extent of network growth and that PEGylated peptides enhance this effect. A further understanding of peptides’ effects on the fibrin network structure will have a strong impact by leading to an enhancement of the biological activity of fibrin and expanding the scope of applications of the fibrin scaffoldBarker, Thomas - Faculty Mento...|$|R

Boundary meshes of each segmented region are connected into loops. Then, the meshes closed by each boundary loop are segmented into a single distinctive region. Finally, all segmented regions are mapped into a single feature using an arti®cial neural network (ANN) based feature recognizer. The FBRES is currently dedicated for reconstructing prismatic features such as a <b>block,</b> <b>pocket,</b> step, slot, hole and boss, which are very common and crucial in mechanical engineering products.

40|$|A novel short-chain (S) - 1 -phenyl- 1, 2 -ethanediol {{dehydrogenase}} (SCR) from Candida parapsilosis exhibits coenzyme specificity for NADPH over NADH. It catalyzes an anti-Prelog type {{reaction to}} reduce 2 -hydroxyacetophenone into (S) - 1 -phenyl- 1, 2 -ethanediol. The coding gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and the purified protein was crystallized. The crystal {{structure of the}} apo-form was solved to 2. 7 Å resolution. This protein forms a homo-tetramer with a broken 2 - 2 - 2 symmetry. The overall fold of each SCR subunit {{is similar to that}} of the known structures of other homologous alcohol dehydrogenases, although the latter usually form tetramers with perfect 2 - 2 - 2 symmetries. Additionally, in the apo-SCR structure, the entrance of the NADPH <b>pocket</b> is <b>blocked</b> by a surface loop. In order to understand the structure–function relationship of SCR, we carried out a number of mutagenesis–enzymatic analyses based on the new structural information. First, mutations of the putative catalytic Ser-Tyr-Lys triad confirmed their functional role. Second, truncation of an N-terminal 31 -residue peptide indicated its role in oligomerization, but not in catalytic activity. Similarly, a V 270 D point mutation rendered the SCR as a dimer, rather than a tetramer, without affecting the enzymatic activity. Moreover, the S 67 D/H 68 D double-point mutation inside the coenzyme-binding pocket resulted in a nearly 10 -fold increase and a 20 -fold decrease in the kcat/KM value when NADH and NADPH were used as cofactors, respectively, with kcat remaining essentially the same.

Colicin D is a 75 kDa protein that consists of a translocation domain, a receptor-binding domain and a cytotoxic domain, which specifically cleaves the anticodon loop of all four tRNAArg isoacceptors, thereby inactivating protein synthesis and leading to cell death. Here we report the 2. 0 Å resolution crystal structure of the complex between the toxic domain and its immunity protein ImmD.

Moreover, little is known on how norovirus infects the host cells, except that histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) are important binding factors for infection and cell entry. Antibodies that bind at the HBGA <b>pocket</b> and <b>block</b> attachment to HBGAs are believed to neutralize the virus. However, additional neutralization epitopes elsewhere on the capsid likely exist and impeding the intrinsic structural dynamics of the capsid could be equally important. In the current study, we investigated a panel of Nanobodies in order to probe functional epitopes that could trigger capsid rearrangement and/ or interfere with HBGA binding interactions. The precise binding sites of six Nanobodies (Nano- 4, Nano- 14, Nano- 26, Nano- 27, Nano- 32, and Nano- 42) were identified using X-ray crystallography. We showed that these Nanobodies bound on the top, side, and bottom of the norovirus protruding domain. The impact of Nanobody binding on norovirus capsid morphology was analyzed using electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. We discovered that distinct Nanobody epitopes were associated with varied changes in particle structural integrity and assembly. Interestingly, certain Nanobody-induced capsid morphological changes lead to the capsid protein degradation and viral RNA exposure. Moreover, Nanobodies employed multiple inhibition mechanisms to prevent norovirus attachment to HBGAs, which included steric obstruction (Nano- 14), allosteric interference (Nano- 32), and violation of normal capsid morphology (Nano- 26 and Nano- 85). Finally, we showed that two Nanobodies (Nano- 26 and Nano- 85) not only compromised capsid integrity and inhibited VLPs attachment to HBGAs, but also recognized a broad panel of norovirus genotypes with high affinities. Consequently, Nano- 26 and Nano- 85 have a great potential to function as novel therapeutic agents against human noroviruses...|$|R

A high-throughput screen of ATX inhibition using the lysophosphatidylcholine-like substrate fluorogenic substrate 3 (FS- 3) and approximately 10, 000 compounds from the University of Cincinnati Drug Discovery Center identified several small-molecule inhibitors with IC(5) (0) vales ranging from nanomolar to low micromolar. The pharmacology of the three most potent compounds: 918013 (1; 2, 4 -dichloro-N-(3 -fluorophenyl) - 5 -(4 -morpholinylsulfonyl) benzamide), 931126 (2; 4 -oxo- 4 -{ 2 -[(5 -phenoxy- 1 H-indol- 2 -yl) carbonyl]hydrazino}-N-(4 -phenylbutan- 2 -yl) bu tanamide), and 966791 (3; N-(2, 6 -dimethylphenyl) - 2 -[N-(2 -furylmethyl) (4 -(1, 2, 3, 4 -tetraazolyl) phenyl) carbony lamino]- 2 -(4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenyl) acetamide), were further characterized in enzyme, cellular, and whole animal models. Compounds 1 and 2 were competitive inhibitors of ATX-mediated hydrolysis of the lysophospholipase substrate FS- 3. In contrast, compound 3 was a competitive inhibitor of both FS- 3 and the phosphodiesterase substrate p-nitrophenyl thymidine 5 '-monophosphate. Computational docking and mutagenesis suggested that compounds 1 and 2 target the hydrophobic <b>pocket,</b> thereby <b>blocking</b> access to the active site of ATX. The potencies of compounds 1 - 3 were comparable to each other in each of the assays. All of these compounds significantly reduced invasion of A 2058 human melanoma cells in vitro and the colonization of lung metastases by B 16 -F 10 murine melanoma cells in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. The compounds had no agonist or antagonist effects on select LPA or sphingosine 1 -phosphate receptors, nor did they inhibit nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP) enzymes NPP 6 and NPP 7.

Misfolded proteins are usually retained intracellularly and may cause inherited diseases. In {{the case of the}} vasopressin V 2 receptor (V 2 R) mutations may cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. A pharmacological approach to treat diseases where misfolded proteins play a role involves the use of pharmacological chaperones, which bind specifically to the native proteins, improve protein folding and consequently rescue the transport of the mutant receptors to the cell membrane. For the V 2 R, the antagonist SR 121463 B {{has been described as a}} pharmacological chaperone. SR 121463 B binds with very high affinity (i. e. almost irreversibly) to the receptor, with the consequence that the natural ligand 8 -arginin-vasopressin (AVP) can not activate rescued receptors because the ligand binding <b>pocket</b> is <b>blocked.</b> In the present study, a high throughput screening assay (HTS) based on automated microscopy was developed in order to identify novel compounds which are able to rescue the trafficking of misfolded and transport defective V 2 R-mutants to the cell membrane. Using this HTS assay, a library containing over 17, 500 compounds was analysed. One hit compound was found which was able to rescue significantly the transport of the L 336 T mutant of the V 2 R to the cell membrane. In various cooperations, the HTS assay was also used to analyze trafficking of other GPCRs such as corticotropin releasing factor receptors. To date, it was not completely clear whether pharmacological chaperones act co or post-translationally. In order to address this question, fusions of the wild type V 2 R and its misfolded receptor mutants S 167 T and R 337 X were generated with the photoconvertible fluorescent protein mKikGR in the second part of this study.

Yet, how different members of a domain family select for distinct sequence motifs is not fully understood. The human genome encodes 120 Src homology 2 (SH 2) domains (in 110 proteins), which mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to proteins with diverse phosphotyrosine (pTyr) -containing sequences. The structure of the SH 2 domain of BRDG 1 bound to a peptide revealed a binding <b>pocket</b> that was <b>blocked</b> by a loop residue in most other SH 2 domains. Analysis of 63 SH 2 domain structures suggested that the SH 2 domains contain three binding pockets, which exhibit selectivity for the three positions after the pTyr in a peptide, and that SH 2 domain loops defined the accessibility and shape of these pockets. Despite sequence variability in the loops, we identified conserved structural features in the loops of SH 2 domains responsible for controlling access to these surface pockets. We engineered new loops in an SH 2 domain that altered specificity as predicted. Thus, selective blockage of binding subsites or pockets by surface loops provides a molecular basis by which the diverse modes of ligand recognition by the SH 2 domain may have evolved and provides a framework for engineering SH 2 domains and designing SH 2 -specific inhibitors...|$|R

Although hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes has been extensively studied by using both in vitro and in vivo models, the molecular mechanism controlling the switch from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes is largely unknown. Since the majority of terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes are growth-arrested in G 1 /G 0 phase, it has been hypothesized that the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) or its related <b>pocket</b> proteins which <b>block</b> G 1 /S transition becomes constitutively active during myocardial terminal differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we studied the regulation of Rb activity by alpha-adrenergic stimulation in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes which are mostly postmitotic in culture. Our results demonstrate that Rb is predominantly in the active hypo-phosphorylated state in control neonatal ventricular myocytes. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation activates G 1 /S transition in foetal but not neonatal rate ventricular myocytes. Although alpha-adrenergic stimulation does not activate G 1 /S transition in neonatal myocytes, it induces hyperphosphorylation of Rb {{to the same extent}} as in proliferating skeletal-muscle myoblasts or foetal ventricles. Hyper- but not hypo-phosphorylated Rb in stimulated neonatal myocytes or proliferating skeletal-muscle myoblasts fails to bind to the transcription factor, E 2 F, suggesting that hyper-phosphorylated Rb is inactive. Therefore F 1 /S transition could also be blocked at steps in addition to Rb inactivation during terminal differentiation and these blockades are refractory to alpha-adrenergic stimulation...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{identified a}} small-molecule anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (anti-HIV- 1) compound, ADS-J 1, using a computer-aided molecular docking technique for primary screening and a sandwich {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) as a secondary screening method. In the present study, we demonstrated that ADS-J 1 is an HIV- 1 entry inhibitor, as determined by a time-of-addition assay and an HIV- 1 -mediated cell fusion assay. Further mechanism studies confirmed that ADS-J 1 does not block gp 120 -CD 4 binding and exhibits a marginal interaction with the HIV- 1 coreceptor CXCR 4. However, ADS-J 1 inhibited the fusion-active gp 41 core formation mimicked by peptides derived from the viral gp 41 N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) and C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR), as determined by ELISA, native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and circular dichroism analysis. Moreover, using a surface plasmon resonance assay, we found that ADS-J 1 could bind directly to IQN 17, a trimeric peptide containing the gp 41 pocket region, resulting in the conformational change of IQN 17 and the blockage of its interaction with a short D peptide, PIE 7. The positively charged residue (K 574) located in the gp 41 pocket region is critical for the binding of ADS-J 1 to NHR. These results suggest that ADS-J 1 may bind to the viral gp 41 NHR region through its hydrophobic and ionic interactions with the hydrophobic and positively charged resides located in the <b>pocket</b> region, subsequently <b>blocking</b> the association between the gp 41 NHR and CHR regions to form the fusion-active gp 41 core, thereby inhibiting HIV- 1 -mediated membrane fusion and virus entry...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{identified a}} potent small-molecule {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) fusion inhibitor, termed ADS-J 1, and hypothesized that it mainly targeted the hydrophobic pocket in the gp 41 N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) trimer. However, this hypothesis has been challenged {{by the fact that}} ADS-J 1 cannot induce drug-resistance mutation in the gp 41 pocket region. Therefore, we show herein that HIV- 1 mutants resistant to T 2635, a peptide derived from the gp 41 C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) region with pocket-binding domain (PBD), were also resistant to ADS-J 1. We also show that pseudoviruses with mutations at positions 64 and 67 in the gp 41 pocket region were highly resistant to ADS-J 1 and C 34, another CHR-peptide with PBD, but relatively sensitive to T 20, a CHR-peptide without PBD. ADS-J 1 could effectively bind to N 36 Fd, a mimic of the gp 41 NHR-trimer with <b>pocket</b> exposed, and <b>block</b> binding of C 34 to N 36 Fd trimer to form six-helix bundle (6 -HB). However, ADS-J 1 was less effective in binding to N 36 Fd trimer with mutations in the gp 41 pocket region, such as N 36 (Q 64 A) Fd, N 36 (Q 64 L) Fd, N 36 (A 67 G) Fd, N 36 (A 67 S) Fd, and N 36 (Q 66 R) Fd, as well as less effective in blocking 6 -HB formation between C 34 and these mutant N 36 Fd trimers. These results confirm that ADS-J 1 mainly targets the pocket region in the HIV- 1 gp 41 NHR trimer and suggest that it {{could be used as a}} lead for developing small-molecule HIV fusion inhibitors and as a molecule probe for studying the mechanisms of gp 41 -mediated membrane fusio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: LEDGF/p 75 (LEDGF) is {{the main}} {{cellular}} cofactor of HIV- 1 integrase (IN). It acts as a tethering factor for IN, and targets the integration of HIV in actively transcribed gene regions of chromatin. A recently developed class of IN allosteric inhibitors can inhibit the LEDGF-IN interaction. RESULTS: We describe {{a new series of}} IN-LEDGF allosteric inhibitors, the most active of which is Mut 101. We determined the crystal structure of Mut 101 in complex with IN and showed that the compound binds to the LEDGF-binding pocket, promoting conformational changes of IN which explain at the atomic level the allosteric effect of the IN/LEDGF interaction inhibitor on IN functions. In vitro, Mut 101 inhibited both IN-LEDGF interaction and IN strand transfer activity while enhancing IN-IN interaction. Time of addition experiments indicated that Mut 101 behaved as an integration inhibitor. Mut 101 was fully active on HIV- 1 mutants resistant to INSTIs and other classes of anti-HIV drugs, indicative that this compound has a new mode of action. However, we found that Mut 101 also displayed a more potent antiretroviral activity at a post-integration step. Infectivity of viral particles produced in presence of Mut 101 was severely decreased. This latter effect also required the binding of the compound to the LEDGF-binding pocket. CONCLUSION: Mut 101 has dual anti-HIV- 1 activity, at integration and post-integration steps of the viral replication cycle, by binding to a unique target on IN (the LEDGF-binding <b>pocket).</b> The post-integration <b>block</b> of HIV- 1 replication in virus-producer cells is the mechanism by which Mut 101 is most active as an antiretroviral. To explain this difference between Mut 101 antiretroviral activity at integration and post-integration stages, we propose the following model: LEDGF is a nuclear, chromatin-bound protein that is absent in the cytoplasm. Therefore, LEDGF can outcompete compound binding to IN in the nucleus of target cells lowering its antiretroviral activity at integration, but not in the cytoplasm where post- integration production of infectious viral particles takes place...|$|R
40|$|Ply-lift and {{pocketing}} are {{two critical}} anomalies of carbon cloth phenolic composites (CCPC) in rocket nozzle applications. Ply lift occurs at low temperatures when the A/P and in-plane permeabilities of the composite materials {{are still very}} low and in-plane porous paths are <b>blocked.</b> <b>Pocketing</b> occurs at elevated temperatures when in-plane permeability is reduced by the A/P compressive stress. The thermostructural response of CCPC in a rapid heating environment involves simultaneous heat, mass, and momentum transfer along with the degradation of phenolic resin in a multiphase system with temperature- and time-dependent material properties as well as dynamic processing conditions. Three temperature regions represent the consequent chemical reactions, material transformations, and property transitions, and provide a quick qualitative method for characterizing the thermostructural behavior of a CCPC. In order to optimize the FM 5939 LDCCP (low density carbon cloth phenolic) for the nozzle performance required in the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) program, a fundamental study on LDCCP materials was conducted. The cured composite has a density of 1. 0 +/- 0. 5 gm/cc which includes 10 to 25 percent void volume. The weight percent of carbon microballoon is low (7 - 15 percent). However, they account for approximately {{one third of the}} volume and historically their percentages have not been controlled very tightly. In addition, the composite properties show no correlation with microballoon weight percent or fiber properties (e. g. fiber density or fiber moisture adsorption capacity). Test results concerning the ply-lift anomaly in the MNASA motor firings were: (1) Steeper ply angle (shorter path lenght) designs minimized/eliminated by lifting, (2) material with higher void volume ply lifted less frequently, (3) materials with high (greater than 9 percent) microballoon content had a higher rate of ply lifting, and (4) LDCCP materials failed at microballoon-resin interfaces. The objectives of this project are: (1) to investigate the effects of carbon microballoon and cabosil fillers as well as fiber heat treatment on plylift-related mechanical properties, (2) to develop a science-based thermostructural process model for the carbon phenolics. The model can be used in the future for the selection of the improved ASRM materials, (3) to develop the micro-failure mechanisms for the ply-lift initiation and propagation processes during the thermoelastic region of phenolic degradation, i. e. postcuring and devolatilization...|$|R
40|$|Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are ancient {{enzymes that}} charge tRNA with its cognate amino acid. In order to {{maintain}} fidelity during protein synthesis, editing mechanisms ensure that tRNAs are accurately charged. Leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) has an editing active site that resides in a discrete domain called the connective polypeptide 1 domain (CP 1). Post-transfer editing involves the translocation of mischarged tRNA from the aminoacylation to the editing active site where mischarged tRNA binds for hydrolysis of the noncognate amino acid to enhance fidelity. Based on crystal structure analysis, the CP 1 domain rotates 30 ?? relative to the canonical core where aminoacylation occurs during tRNA translocation and presumably facilitates the movement of tRNA from the core domain to the editing domain. Single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) techniques were employed to characterize this dynamic movement of tRNA from one domain of the enzyme to another. Human cytoplasmic LeuRS (hscLeuRS) is typically found in a macromolecular complex containing at least eight other proteins. In order to study this enzyme, hscLeuRS was expressed independent of the complex in Escherichia coli. Enzymatic characterization of the isolated hscLeuRS suggested that it attaches a second leucine to Leu-tRNALeu. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry methods were used {{in an attempt to}} isolate this hypothesized ???doubly charged??? tRNA species and it is possible that hscLeuRS possesses a secondary function beyond aminoacylation reliant on a doubly charged Leu-Leu-tRNALeu. Further biochemical analysis of the hscLeuRS focused on its editing pocket. The editing site of hscLeuRS includes a highly conserved threonine discriminator and universally conserved aspartic acid that were mutationally characterized. Substitution of threonine to alanine uncoupled specificity similar to other LeuRSs. However, the introduction of bulky residues in the amino acid binding <b>pocket</b> failed to <b>block</b> deacylation of tRNA, indicating that the architecture of the amino acid binding pocket is different compared to other characterized LeuRSs. In addition, mutation of the universally conserved aspartic acid abolished tRNALeu deacylation. Surprisingly though, this editing-defective hscLeuRS maintained fidelity. This indicates that an alternate editing mechanism may have been activated upon failure of the post-transfer editing active site in {{order to maintain}} fidelity during protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Reverse Engineering (RE) is {{the process}} of reconstructing CAD models from scanned data of a {{physical}} part acquired using 3 D scanners. RE has attracted a great deal of research interest over the last decade. However, {{a review of the literature}} reveals that most research work have focused on creation of free form surfaces from point cloud data. Representing geometry in terms of surface patches is adequate to represent positional information, but can not capture any of the higher level structure of the part. Reconstructing solid models is of importance since the resulting solid models can be directly imported into commercial solid modellers for various manufacturing activities such as process planning, integral property computation, assembly analysis, and other applications. This research discusses the novel methodology of extracting geometric features directly from a data set of 3 D scanned points, which utilises the concepts of artificial neural networks (ANNs). In order to design and develop a generic feature-based RE system for prismatic parts, the following five main tasks were investigated. (1) point data processing algorithms; (2) edge detection strategies; (3) a feature recogniser using ANNs; (4) a feature extraction module; (5) a CAD model exchanger into other CAD/CAM systems via IGES. A key feature of this research is the incorporation of ANN in feature recognition. The use of ANN approach has enabled the development of a flexible feature-based RE methodology that can be trained to deal with new features. ANNs require parallel input patterns. In this research, four geometric attributes extracted from a point set are input to the ANN module for feature recognition: chain codes, convex/concave, circular/rectangular and open/closed attribute. Recognising each feature requires the determination of these attributes. New and robust algorithms are developed for determining these attributes for each of the features. This feature-based approach currently focuses on solving the feature recognition problem based on 2. 5 D shapes such as <b>block</b> <b>pocket,</b> step, slot, hole, and boss, which are common and crucial in mechanical engineering products. This approach is validated using a set of industrial components. The test results show that the strategy for recognising features is reliable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background ALG- 2 (a {{gene product}} of PDCD 6) {{belongs to the}} penta-EF-hand (PEF) protein family and Ca 2 + -dependently interacts with various {{intracellular}} proteins including mammalian Alix, an adaptor protein in the ESCRT system. Our previous X-ray crystal structural analyses revealed that binding of Ca 2 + to EF 3 enables the side chain of R 125 to move {{enough to make a}} primary hydrophobic pocket (Pocket 1) accessible to a short fragment of Alix. The side chain of F 122, facing a secondary hydrophobic pocket (Pocket 2), interacts with the Alix peptide. An alternatively spliced shorter isoform, designated ALG- 2 ΔGF 122, lacks Gly 121 Phe 122 and does not bind Alix, but the structural basis of the incompetence has remained to be elucidated. Results We solved the X-ray crystal structure of the PEF domain of ALG- 2 ΔGF 122 in the Ca 2 + -bound form and compared it with that of ALG- 2. Deletion of the two residues shortened α-helix 5 (α 5) and changed the configuration of the R 125 side chain so that it partially <b>blocked</b> <b>Pocket</b> 1. A wall created by the main chain of 121 -GFG- 123 and facing the two pockets was destroyed. Surprisingly, however, substitution of F 122 with Ala or Gly, but not with Trp, increased the Alix-binding capacity in binding assays. The F 122 substitutions exhibited different effects on binding of ALG- 2 to other known interacting proteins, including TSG 101 (Tumor susceptibility gene 101) and annexin A 11. The X-ray crystal structure of the F 122 A mutant revealed that removal of the bulky F 122 side chain not only created an additional open space in Pocket 2 but also abolished inter-helix interactions with W 95 and V 98 (present in α 4) and that α 5 inclined away from α 4 to expand Pocket 2, suggesting acquirement of more appropriate positioning of the interacting residues to accept Alix. Conclusions We found that the inability of the two-residue shorter ALG- 2 isoform to bind Alix is not due to the absence of bulky side chain of F 122 but due to deformation of a main-chain wall facing pockets 1 and 2. Moreover, a residue at the position of F 122 contributes to target specificity and a smaller side chain is preferable for Alix binding but not favored to bind annexin A 11. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{development}} of two technologies allows {{application of a}} generalized formulation of travel time inversion to very large data sets, such as the surface reflection surveys collected for oil exploration. This generalized formulation uses very small cell sizes, effectively eliminating discretization effects. Inversion of an effective continuum that has no built-in a priori constraints is what places this technique {{in the category of}} tomography. In reflection surveys, the generalized formulation investigated here treats the continuous velocity field independently from the reflector locations. The a priori assumption, common with travel time inversions in seismic exploration data, is thus not made: that the velocity field is defined as a series of layers with constant or smoothly varying velocity. This assumption restricts significant velocity variations to occur only at reflector locations. Velocity parameterized as layers is merely one of many geologic constraints that can be added optionally in tomographic inversion. The technologies that enable this generalized approach to travel time inversion are: 1) a computer program capable of tracing rays through a 2 - dimensional grid of points and off reflectors with structure, and 2) iterative schemes that efficiently perform damped, constrained generalized matrix inversions over a user-specified wide eigenvalue range for very large model and data sizes. An argument is presented that a variation of Richardson's iteration is preferred to the Conjugate Gradient Iterative Method for performing the matrix inversion. With this generalized formulation, Ray Trace Tomography is a first approach to tomographic transmission analysis. Travel times and ray paths are a valid approximation to the wave equation for broad velocity variations. The method efficiently addresses the characteristics of more general but much more expensive transmission techniques. For example, Ray Trace Tomography demonstrates that an iterative application of a transmission velocity analysis technique, tomography, and a scattering reflector location technique, migration, do not necessarily converge to the optimal solution. To resolve the ambiguity between velocity-reflector depth, velocity and reflector locations must be coupled in one inversion technique. Ray Trace Tomography is able to couple the two. Using it to indicate the absolute resolution between velocity and reflector depth, we find that for certain geometries, reflector depths cannot be resolved where most recorded energy travels within 45 ° of vertical. Poor resolution of the velocity-reflector depth ambiguity and other problems are inherent to reflection surveys. These problems also exist for other transmission techniques and can be solved only through use of inversion constraints. Ray Trace Tomography can test constraints for possible use in other transmission techniques efficiently. Ray Trace Tomography has difficulty with non-linearities caused by some types of starting model errors, such as small-scale reflector structure. Improved performance with non-linearities is an objective we should seek in other transmission techniques. Not only is Ray Trace Tomography a useful intellectual exercise as a preliminary analysis of transmission inversion, but in many cases it is a viable technique for addressing serious problems with surface seismic reflection data. It can determine an accurate two-dimensional velocity field for migration, such {{as in the case of}} gas <b>pockets</b> or fault <b>blocks.</b> In addition, it can resolve between certain velocity and reflector ambiguities such as those occuring in the permafrost region of Alaska. As a comparatively efficient technique, Ray Trace Tomography can serve as a tool for interactive interpretation. The geologist can use the ray tracing to compare various geologic models with the data and then use the inversion to finetune the models. The inversion enables the geologist to formulate his geologic knowledge as constraints in the inversion. By analyzing the inversion results, the interpreter will develop an understanding of the validity of the various models and the resolution amoung them. </p...|$|R
