50|$|There are {{two types}} of body waves, Pressure waves or <b>Primary</b> <b>waves</b> (P-waves) and Shear or Secondary waves (S-waves). P-waves are {{longitudinal}} waves that involve compression and expansion in the direction that the wave is moving and are always the first waves to appear on a seismogram as they are the fastest moving waves through solids. S-waves are transverse waves that move perpendicular to the direction of propagation. S-waves are slower than P-waves. Therefore, they appear later than P-waves on a seismogram. Fluids cannot support perpendicular motion, so S-waves only travel in solids.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>waves</b> (P-waves) are compressional {{waves that}} are {{longitudinal}} in nature. P waves are pressure waves that travel faster than other waves through {{the earth to}} arrive at seismograph stations first, hence the name [...] "Primary". These waves can travel through any type of material, including fluids, and can travel at nearly twice the speed of S waves. In air, they {{take the form of}} sound waves, hence they travel at the speed of sound. Typical speeds are 330 m/s in air, 1450 m/s in water and about 5000 m/s in granite.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of seismic [...] "ocean waves". The <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> are {{generated}} in shallow waters by direct water wave-land interaction and have the same period as the water waves (10 to 16 seconds). The more powerful secondary waves are generated by the superposition of ocean waves of equal period traveling in opposite directions, thus generating standing gravity waves - with an associated pressure oscillation at half the period, which is not diminishing with depth. The theory for microseism generation by standing waves was provided by Michael Longuet-Higgins in 1950, after in 1941 Pierre Bernard suggested this relation with standing waves on the basis of observations.|$|E

The development of efficient algorithms for nuclear detonation detection has led to many advancements in other fields such as kriging, an advanced method of interpolation used primarily in geostatistics. Algorithms are used to identify key characteristics of wave forms, such as peak-to-peak distance, amplitude, phase, P-wave amplitude, and S-wave amplitude. P-waves, or <b>primary</b> <b>waves,</b> are compression waves that propagate quickly through rock, and are generally the first waves to reach seismic stations.

50|$|Advance {{earthquake}} warning {{is possible}} by detecting the non-destructive <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> that travel more {{quickly through the}} Earth's crust than do the destructive secondary and Rayleigh waves, {{in the same way}} that lightning flashes reach our eyes before we hear the thunder during a storm. The amount of advance warning depends on the delay between the arrival of the P-wave and other destructive waves, generally on the order of seconds up to about 60-90 seconds for deep, distant, large quakes such as Tokyo would have received before the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The effectiveness of advance warning depends on accurate detection of the P-waves and rejection of ground vibrations caused by local activity (such as trucks or construction) as otherwise false-positive warnings will result. Earthquake Early Warning systems can be automated to allow for immediate safety actions such as issuing alerts, stopping elevators at the nearest floors or switching gas utilities off.|$|E

The principal bends of the <b>primary</b> <b>wave,</b> being of greater angle than the reverse bends, strongly resist invasion by the secondary waves; when a principal bend of the <b>primary</b> <b>wave</b> propagates off the flagellar tip, the secondary wave behind it suddenly increases in amplitude. We claim that the functional state of the dynein motors {{in relation to the}} <b>primary</b> <b>wave</b> can be deduced from their availability for recruitment into secondary wave activity. Therefore, only the dyneins in bends are committed functionally to the maintenance and propagation of the flagellar wave; dyneins in interbend regions are not functionally committed in this way.

Fewer lower class Iraqis settled in Jordan, as their poverty meant that they did not have the financial means to emigrate.

40|$|Shoaling wave fields {{generated}} in laboratory experiments were analyzed {{to determine the}} sensitivity of nonlinear interactions to the directional distributions of incident waves. Peaks in the directional spectra observed in shallow water were consistent with near resonating, quadratic interactions between two <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> transferring energy to a third wave with the sum frequency and vector sum wavenumber of the <b>primary</b> <b>waves.</b> Directionally colinear waves forced a higher-frequency wave propagating {{in the same direction}} as the <b>primary</b> <b>waves,</b> while directionally spread (i. e., noncolinear) <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> forced a higher-frequency wave that propagated in a direction between those of the interacting <b>primary</b> <b>waves.</b> Deepwater wave fields with similar frequency spectra but different directional spectra evolved to different shallow-water directional spectra, yet their shallow-water frequency spectra were remarkably similar. This result suggests that the shape of the directional spectrum of the incident wave field has only a small effect on the magnitudes of nonlinear energy transfer during shoaling. The principal effect of directionality in the incident wave field is on the directions, not the amplitudes, of the nonlinearly generated waves. The laboratory data demonstrate clearly the importance of triad interactions between noncolinear and colinear shoaling waves...|$|E

40|$|Propagation of an {{atmospheric}} {{gravity wave}} (AGW) in a wind field is studied by numerical simulation. Two models are applied: {{the first is}} a linear model to check with the gravity wave theory; the second is a quasi-nonlinear model to study the char-acteristics of the secondary waves produced by the interactions between two gravity wave packets. The magnitudes and directions of the vertical phase and group velocities obtained by linear simulation are consistent with the prediction of linear gravity wave theory. That is, the vertical propagation velocities of the phase and the energy of an AGW are always opposite to each other. In the quasi-nonlinear model, two <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> are forced to oscillate at the ground level with their group velocities upward and phase velocities downward, which creates two secondary waves by the interaction be-tween the <b>primary</b> <b>waves.</b> The smaller one is found to have group velocity upward and phase velocity downward just {{the same as that of}} the two <b>primary</b> <b>waves.</b> The group velocity of the larger one is found to be downward always, while its phase velocity is upward when the <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> in the source region are still oscillating and becomes downward after the <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> stop oscillation. The result reveals that the smaller one is a production of a resonant interaction; while the larger one is the production of a non-resonant interaction.

40|$|We {{study the}} modulational {{instability}} of geophysical Rossby and plasma drift waves within the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima (CHM) model both theoretically, using truncated (four-mode and three-mode) models, and numerically, using direct simulations of CHM equation in the Fourier space. The linear theory predicts instability for any amplitude {{of the primary}} wave. For strong <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> the most unstable modes are perpendicular to the primary wave, which correspond to generation of a zonal flow if the primary wave is purely meridional. For weaker waves, the maximum growth occurs for off-zonal inclined modulations. For very weak <b>primary</b> <b>waves</b> the unstable waves are close to being in three-wave resonance with the primary wave. The nonlinear theory predicts that the zonal flows generated by the linear instability experience pinching into narrow zonal jets. Our numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions of the linear theory {{as well as of}} the nonlinear pinching. We find that, for strong <b>primary</b> <b>waves,</b> these narrow zonal jets further roll up into Karman-like vortex streets. On the other hand, for weak <b>primary</b> <b>waves,</b> the growth of the unstable mode reverses and the system oscillates between a dominant jet and a dominate primary wave. The 2 D vortex streets appear to be more stable than purely 1 D zonal jets, and their zonal-averaged speed can reach amplitudes much stronger than is allowed by the Rayleigh-Kuo instability criterion for the 1 D case. We find that the truncation models work well for both the linear stage and and often even for the medium-term nonlinear behavior. In the long term, the system transitions to turbulence helped by the vortex-pairing instability (for strong waves) and by the resonant wave-wave interactions (for weak waves).
