40|$|I {{start by}} {{attempting}} to clarify {{the ways in which}} Coelho and Figueiredo (2003) use the logic <b>of</b> <b>supplementarity</b> to conceptualize the discourses on intersubjectivity in terms of four dimensions of otherness. A new domain of application is proposed and the limits of the approach are pointed to. In the second section I critically examine {{the extent to which these}} four dimensions, and the movements <b>of</b> <b>supplementarity</b> between them, adequately capture the theories of intersubjectivity. The use of these dimensions seems, on the one hand, to obfuscate several interesting contradictions between the theoretical approaches within the dimensions, and, on the other hand, to artificially partition the theoretical traditions between the four dimensions. In the final section, Mead's account of intersubjectivity, and the constitution of subjectivity, is presented, and developed, as operating in the spaces between the proposed dimensions of otherness...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the importance}} of supplementary material for art history and philosophy by addressing its shifting and problematic relationship to the ‘work of art’. Through the use of philosophical and critical theories, including Heidegger, Benjamin, Adorno, Deleuze and Derrida, the nature and status of artworks are explored through different uses <b>of</b> <b>supplementarity</b> that are identified and developed in order to re-evaluate the cultural significance <b>of</b> <b>supplementarity</b> itself. This theoretical analysis is complemented by a cultural history that demonstrates, through a discussion of changes in artistic practices, theoretical perceptions, markets and ‘cultures of display’, {{the ways in which}} conceptions of the work <b>of</b> art and <b>supplementarity</b> are historically contingent. The main body of the thesis is composed of four case studies. In the first, Heidegger’s distinction between art and equipment and his notion of causality is used to analyse Henry Moore’s maquettes, plasters, and bronze works, in order to distinguish preliminary and preparatory material from complete works of art. The second focuses on hierarchy and supplementarity, developing Deleuze’s concept of the simulacrum by showing how the drawings and sketches of Antonio Sant’Elia can be considered works of art, despite being traditionally identified as supporting material. Walter Benjamin’s theory of aura, and Theodor Adorno’s notion of enigmaticalness, are deployed in a third case study that analyses the significance of the relocation of Francis Bacon’s studio from London to Dublin, and the use of biographical material to foreground the creative process. The final case study deploys Jacques Derrida’s analysis of Antonin Artaud’s works on paper that problematises prevailing classifications of art, and Derrida’s interpretation of Artaud’s notion of the subjectile, in order to emphasise the often ambiguous status of ostensibly supplementary material. Overall, the thesis re-evaluates the cultural significance <b>of</b> <b>supplementarity</b> for aesthetics by analysing the ways in which supplementary material affects how works of art are experienced and understood...|$|R

The COP/MOP is the body that {{represents}} the signers/ratifiers of the protocol {{and they have not}} been able to agree on a specific definition of the limit on use of flexible mechanisms. The original text has been interpreted to mean that anywhere from 3-50% of emissions could be offset by trading mechanisms.

To distinguish our principle from the Bohr's principle and to give better characterization, we change the terminology and speak about supplementarity, instead of complementarity.

40|$|The Kizima's {{opinion about}} the methodological role of post-non-classical {{research}} {{in the development of}} anthropological theory is analysed in this article. The Kizima's theory on the man attaches particular importance to syzygy as an anthropological principle, refutes epistemological and ontological paradigm of modern philosophy and defends the integrated approach to the decision of problems. Reader is invited to conclude significantly overestimated self heralds Post-non-classical paradigm, on a simplified understanding of prospects for formation of anthropology as an universal theory. The author considers the syzygic anthropology over the context of the problem of systematization of history of Ukrainian philosophy, explores its place in the development of anthropological and philosophical views in Ukraine. This article analyzes the main ideas of syzygic anthropology that embody innovations of scientific cognition. In author's opinion, the originality of Kizima's anthropology is determined by the type of subjectivity formed in Ukrainian culture. This type of subjectivity is connected with the type of space assimilation. Ukrainian mentality is based on the principles gathering of being in the unity of place. Syzygic anthropology represents reconstruction of the world as a space of forving the self of a Ukrainian man. The Kizima's discourse defends the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplementarity.</b> The main accent has been made on necessity of the rejection of substantial approach to study of man, for this reason a multitude of theories of thinking about the postcontemporary processes of pluralism has been created. The simulative character of post-non-classical culture of thinking is demonstrated. The concept of transformations of features of «the soul/the body» opposition are tracked in the perspective of the latest values hierarchy. В статье проанализирована точка зрения В. В.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} verbal and visual systems in the work Austerlitz of W. G. Sebald (1944 - 2001) and considers the comparison between the German version and the translations from Portugal and Brazil, analyzing the shifts of meaning that arise when, in translation, {{the arrangement of the}} photographs within the text is changed. The analytical comparison of three passages from the work shows that in a translation that involves different systems of signs, certain changes in the plastic disposition reflect differences in symbolic and conceptual changes. By Mieke Bal’s mode, space interaction between the legible and visible is understood as the space of intersection, and deployment <b>of</b> <b>supplementarity</b> senses. So there is at Austerlitz a relationship between self image and text, but of mutual interdependence in which the semio-aesthetics vitality of the work finds support. On the one side the analyzes aim to elucidate the discursive richness that lurks in the image-interface text within the work of Sebald, and on the other, also reveal how complex and utopian is the translation when it is confronted not only with the distances between the verbal language, but also between the verbal and visual languages...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{illuminate}} potential problems with the flexibility mechanism in the Kyoto Protocol connected to the establishment of an enforcement system. The Kyoto mechanisms are emission trading, Joint Implementation with other Annex B countries and finally the Clean Development Mechanism. With regard to emission trading, we discuss new challenges for monitoring, reporting and verification, the issue <b>of</b> <b>supplementarity,</b> intertemporal emission trading, the “hot-air” problem and liability issues. The Joint Implementation mechanism is a credit trading mechanism within an already established emission trading regime. The additional problems for Joint Implementation projects under the Kyoto Protocol compared to emission trading would mainly be higher transaction costs obtained from bargaining between two parties. Increased costs through an enforcement system would not necessarily occur here. The Clean Development Mechanism on the other hand is a credit trading mechanism outside an emission trading system and here several new problems arise. We discuss the problem of additionality and leakages. Finally, we discuss the enforcement of non-compliance under the Protocol. We conclude by discussing the possible incentives for cheating and undermining the intentions of the Protocol that are revealed by the problems with the flexibility mechanisms discussed in the pape...|$|R

40|$|Videogames {{have emerged}} as arguably the most {{prominent}} form of entertainment in recent years. Their versatility has made them key contributory factors in social, literary, cultural and philosophical discourse; however, critics also tend to see videogames as posing a threat to established cultural parameters. This thesis argues that videogames are firmly grounded in older media and they are important {{for the development of}} the notions of textuality, technicity and identity that literary and cultural theories have been debating in recent years. As its point of departure, the thesis takes the contested role of videogames as storytelling media. Challenging the opposition between games and narratives that is posited in earlier research, the framework of the Derridean concept <b>of</b> <b>supplementarity</b> has been adopted to illustrate how the ludic and the narrative inform each other's core, and yet retain their media-specific identities. It is also vital to consider how the technicity and narrative of games inform their perception as texts. Videogames provide a direct illustration of this but they develop on similar principles in earlier media instead of doing something entirely 'new'. The multitelic structure of videogames tends to be looked upon as symptomatic of novelty; in reality, however, they illustrate more clearly the inherent nature of telos in all narrative media...|$|R
