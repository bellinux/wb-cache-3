Vibraphonist Warren Wolf stated that Miller helped him early in his career, including by being a link to jazz history: [...] "you're getting that experience of playing with Art Blakey, that attitude of 'Yes, it's my band, but you have to give other <b>people</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> shine.'" [...] Robert Glasper also cited Miller as an influence, and wrote and recorded [...] "One for 'Grew" [...] as a tribute.|$|E
500|$|Since 1952, the News-Miner has {{featured}} a small cartoon figure named Sourdough Jack {{at the bottom}} of its front page. The drawing of Sourdough Jack is always paired with a comment on a news story, pun, or joke, apparently having been spoken by the figure. The idea for Sourdough Jack came from News-Miner editor John J. Ryan, who said, [...] "People had many complaints about the town. ... He could make fun of that stuff and that would give <b>people</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> laugh at their problems." [...] Sourdough Jack's name came from Ryan's nickname (Jack) and the traditional nickname given to an old miner (sourdough). [...] Jack Ryan worked for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer later in his life. John Ryan changed his name in the 70's to John O'Ryan.|$|E

2500|$|Details of {{what had}} {{happened}} with the poll were picked up by various media; as one writer explained, [...] "Voting for Hank offered <b>people</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> violate People's expectations while still playing by its rules”. [...] Some observers concluded that the reaction by the public to vote for Hank was a veiled commentary on how the media assumes that the masses are easily manipulated into liking what is marketed to them. The New York Times quoted a participant in the poll as stating, [...] "The 'media' tells us what food to eat, what movies to see, what music to listen to, who to vote for politically and what kind of people are attractive enough to have relationships with!...Voting for 'Hank the Dwarf' is a reflection of how the people really feel about media!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{monument}} {{was designed}} by New York artist Deborah Jackson, {{with the understanding that}} the design had to be approved by both the Secretary of the Army and the United States Commission of Fine Arts (which met in June 2011) after which time fabrication of the monument plaque began. Before the actual installation and dedication at Arlington Cemetery, creators and backers of the monument first arranged for it to [...] "go on tour to different communities, giving <b>people</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> see it and learn more about the role of Jewish chaplains." [...] According to the JWB Jewish Chaplains Council the plan is to dedicate the monument during the fall of 2011, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Jewish chaplaincy, based on the Civil War commissioning of the first Jewish chaplain. In addition to the names of the thirteen fallen Jewish chaplains, the memorial will include the words of a Jewish folk proverb, [...] "I ask not for a lighter burden, but for broader shoulders." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{changes to}} the event {{occurred}} in 1991. The District of Columbia's African American gay community sponsored the first [...] "Black Lesbian and Gay Pride Day" [...] on May 25, 1991. The event was created not as a competitor to the June gay pride event {{but rather as a}} way of enhancing the visibility of the African American gay and lesbian community. 1991 also saw the Gay Pride Day parade and festival move away from its traditional date for the first time. [...] Organizers shifted the event to the week prior to Father's Day to give <b>people</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> spend the holiday with their families. 1991 was also the year that the street festival expanded to more than 200 booths, and the first year that active-duty and retired American military personnel marched in the parade. The parade made national headlines when U.S. Air Force Captain Greg Greeley, who led the active-duty group, was later questioned by military security officers and told his pending discharge was on hold because of his participation in Gay Pride day. No further action against Greeley was taken, and he eventually received an honorable discharge.|$|E

2500|$|The United States lobbied {{against the}} {{resolution}} {{being brought to}} the UNGA, while Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman {{said that it was}} only exacerbating the situation and that a vote would trigger [...] "an extreme response from us." [...] However, following Operation Pillar of Defense, and under pressure from the United States, Israel stopped its threats of punishment to Abbas for going ahead with the move to the UN. Lieberman also went to New York City to meet Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, while Ambassador Ron Prosor was scheduled to speak after Abbas. Israeli former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert wrote: [...] "I believe that the Palestinian request from the United Nations is congruent with the basic concept of the two-state solution. Therefore, I see no reason to oppose it. Once the United Nations will lay the foundation for this idea, we in Israel will have to engage in a serious process of negotiations, in order to agree on specific borders based on the 1967 lines, and resolve the other issues. It is time to give a hand to, and encourage, the moderate forces amongst the Palestinians. Abu-Mazen [...] (Mahmoud Abbas) and Salam Fayyad need our help. It's time to give it." [...] There was a rally in support of the Palestinian bid in Tel Aviv's Rothschild Boulevard, which was organised by Gush Shalom, Peace Now, Hadash and Meretz. Former Foreign Ministry director Dr. Alon Liel said: [...] "As of today there is a Palestinian state. As of today we no longer control the life of a nation but the life of a separate state." [...] Former Meretz MK Mossi Raz said: [...] "We call on Lieberman and Netanyahu: It's not too late. Order the ambassador to say 'Israel yes.'" [...] Arab-Israeli singer Mira Awad also performed at the rally and said that she was [...] "happy with Abbas' bid and very sad about the inexplicable refusal to finally give the Palestinian <b>people</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> move forward." [...] Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard was criticised by Jewish groups for not rejecting the motion; she had initially wished to vote against the measure, but abstained instead due to opposition from her own cabinet and caucus. Netanyahu later downplayed the importance of the vote in saying that [...] "the decision at the United Nations will change nothing on the ground. It will not advance the establishment of a Palestinian state. It will delay it further. No matter how many hands are raised against us there is no power on earth that will cause me to compromise on Israel's security." ...|$|E
