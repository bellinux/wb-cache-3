25|$|Transsexual self-identified people {{sometimes}} wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their <b>primary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics,</b> secondary characteristics, or both, {{because they feel}} {{they will be more}} comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.|$|E

50|$|Sex {{differences}} {{directly related}} to reproduction and serving no direct purpose in courtship are called <b>primary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Traits amenable to sexual selection, which give an organism an advantage over its rivals (such as in courtship) without being directly involved in reproduction, are called secondary sex characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Physical sex {{characteristics}} include primary sex {{characteristics and}} secondary sex <b>characteristics.</b> A <b>primary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic,</b> as narrowly defined, is any anatomical {{part of the}} body involved in sexual reproduction and constituting the reproductive system in a complex organism, especially the external sex organs; the external sex organs are also commonly referred to as the genitalia or genitals.|$|R
50|$|A sex organ (also {{called a}} {{reproductive}} organ, primary sex organ, or <b>primary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic)</b> is any anatomical {{part of the}} body in a complex organism that is involved in sexual reproduction and together constitute the reproductive system. The external and visible organs, in males and females, are the primary sex organs known as the genitals or genitalia. The internal organs are known as the secondary sex organs and are sometimes referred to as the internal genitalia.The characteristics that begin to appear during puberty, such as, in humans, pubic hair on both sexes and facial hair on the male, are known as secondary sex characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|A {{particular}} type of anatomically correct dolls are used in law enforcement and therapy. These dolls have detailed depictions of all the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> of a human: [...] "oral and anal openings, ears, tongues, nipples, and hands with individual fingers" [...] for all and a [...] "vagina, clitoris and breasts" [...] {{for each of the}} women and a [...] "penis and testicles" [...] for each of the men.|$|R
50|$|In humans, sex organs or <b>primary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics,</b> {{which are}} those {{a person is}} born with, can be {{distinguished}} from secondary sex characteristics, which develop later in life, usually during puberty. The development of both is controlled by sex hormones produced by the body after the initial fetal stage where {{the presence or absence}} of the Y-chromosome and/or the SRY gene determine development.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though the}} term {{assignment}} suggests {{a decision on}} the part of the parents or medical professionals, the act almost universally constitutes an observation or recognition of inherent <b>primary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> of a baby. In the majority of cases, the gender of rearing of the child matches the child's gender identity. The act of assignment carries the implicit expectation that future gender identity will develop in alignment with the physical anatomy, assignment, and rearing.|$|E
50|$|Beyond Japan, {{the term}} is used to {{describe}} a commonly pornographic genre of eroge, comics, and anime which includes characters that show both <b>primary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b> In today's language it refers almost exclusively to characters who have an overall feminine body, but have both female and male genitalia (although testicles are not always present). In that case {{the term is}} also often abbreviated as futa(s), which is occasionally also used as a generalized term for the works itself.|$|E
50|$|For trans people, hormone {{replacement}} therapy (HRT) causes the development {{of many of the}} secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> of their desired sex. However, many of the existing <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> cannot be reversed by HRT. For example, HRT can induce breast growth for trans women but can only minimally reduce breasts for trans men. HRT can prompt facial hair growth for transsexual men, but cannot regress facial hair for transsexual women. HRT may, however, reverse some characteristics, such as distribution of body fat and muscle, as well as menstruation in trans men.|$|R
5000|$|One {{example of}} the {{challenges}} involved {{in the use of}} the term is the case of women with Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS). These women often have <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> typical of other women; however, they are karyotypically XY and have internal testes, rather than ovaries. They have the same likelihood of a karyotypically XX woman of enjoying sexual pleasure but are unable to biologically reproduce. Their sexuality (homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual etc.) is not necessarily determined by this syndrome. However scientifically precise the description [...] "male" [...] pseudohermaphrodite may be for such women, its social inappropriateness is in controversy.|$|R
2500|$|BDSM {{parties are}} events on which BDSM {{practitioners}} and other similarly interested people meet {{in order to}} communicate, share experiences and knowledge, and to [...] "play" [...] in an erotic atmosphere. The parties show similarities with ones in the dark culture, being based on {{a more or less}} strictly enforced dress code; most often clothing made of latex, leather or vinyl/PVC, lycra and so on., emphasizing the body's shape and the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic.</b> The requirement for such dress codes differ. While some events have none, others have a policy {{in order to create a}} more coherent atmosphere and to prevent onlookers from taking part.|$|R
50|$|The term <b>primary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{denotes the}} kind of gamete the gonad {{produces}}: the ovary produces egg cells in the female, and the testis produces sperm cells in the male. The term secondary sexual characteristics denotes all other sexual distinctions that play indirect roles in uniting sperm and eggs. Secondary sexual characteristics include everything from the specialized male and female features of the genital tract, to the brilliant plumage of male birds or facial hair of humans, to behavioral features such as courtship.|$|E
5000|$|In some cell types, {{testosterone}} interacts {{directly with}} androgen receptors, whereas, in others, testosterone is converted by 5-alpha-reductase to dihydrotestosterone, {{an even more}} potent agonist for androgen receptor activation. [...] Testosterone {{appears to be the}} primary androgen receptor-activating hormone in the Wolffian duct, whereas dihydrotestosterone is the main androgenic hormone in the urogenital sinus, urogenital tubercle, and hair follicles. [...] Hence, testosterone is responsible primarily for the development of male <b>primary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics,</b> whereas dihydrotestosterone is responsible for secondary male characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The {{training}} outfits used by {{the main}} characters are similar to tankinis, but with the top half's bottom ending very high. Their flight uniforms are skin-tight, and the small interiors of their R.A.s make for close-up scenes, sometimes at immodest angles. Their standard uniforms are more modest from the waist up, but feature high miniskirts and high stockings. Misaki appears in a full-frontal nudity scene {{very early in the}} series, but without any <b>primary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> drawn. Scenes in her quarters also sometimes tend to have her in various states of undress.|$|E
50|$|During adolescence, {{the human}} body {{undergoes}} various physical, physiological and immunological changes triggered and mediated by hormones, of which the most significant in females is 17-β-oestradiol (an oestrogen) and, in males, is testosterone. Oestradiol usually begins to act around the age of 10 and testosterone some months later. There is evidence that these steroids not only act directly on the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> but also {{have an effect on}} the development and regulation of the immune system, including an increased risk in developing pubescent and post-pubescent autoimmunity. There is also some evidence that cell surface receptors on B cells and macrophages may detect sex hormones in the system.|$|R

30|$|Darwin {{proposed}} {{sexual selection}} {{to explain why}} in some species the males have such magnificent ornaments and in some species, such impressive weapons and females choose particularly ornate males (female choice) or accept the winner of males (male-male competition). Darwin describes female choice as accepting “not the male which is most attractive to her, but the one which is least distasteful” (Weihe 1987; Harcourt and Gardiner 1994; Harcourt 1995). Thus, secondary sexual characteristics (larger size, large antlers, and brightly colored plumage) appear to provide a breeding advantage. Similarly, the <b>primary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the external genitalia must also provide a reproductive advantage for each species. It is likely to provide support during prolonged intromissions, female genital stimulation, and/or sperm transport facilitation and delivery (Monica and Scalici 2017).|$|E
40|$|During {{intensive}} sandy beach {{sampling of}} the Korean coasts, only one haustoriid genus, Eohaustorius, which is endemic to the North Pacific, has been revealed. Four new species of this genus are described herein: E. stocki n. sp., E. longidactylus n. sp., E. spinigerus n. sp., and E. setulosus n. sp. Key to the known species and diagnosis of the genus are provided.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveWe {{report an}} 18 -year-old patient with {{bilateral}} ovarian agenesis, rudimentary uterus and normal fallopian tubes, and with normal 46,XX karyotype (without mosaicism). Case ReportThe patient {{was admitted to}} our clinic with <b>primary</b> amenorrhea. Secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> (thelarche and pubarche) were both Tanner classification stage 1. With the help of vaginoscopy, vaginal depth was measured without distorting the hymenal ring and {{was found to be}} 8 cm. The laboratory findings were as follows: follicle-stimulating hormone 85 IU/L, luteinizing hormone 40 IU/L, and estradiol 14 pg/dL. Genetic investigation revealed a 46,XX karyotype without any mosaicism. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed. During laparoscopic pelvic exploration, a rudimentary uterus without ovaries and normal bilateral fallopian tubes were observed. Bone mineral densitometry measurements were in the normal range. The patient was given oral contraceptives for hormone replacement. ConclusionIf gonadal agenesis is thought to be the cause of primary amenorrhea in patients with defective secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics,</b> we believe that laparoscopic evaluation is the gold standard in diagnosis...|$|R
2500|$|Basic {{physiology}} is studied, mostly endocrinology and the hormonal {{influence of}} <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b> It is taught {{that there are}} three fundamental nervous systems, the cerebrospinal nervous system, grand sympathetic nervous system, and the Parasympathetic nervous system. These nervous systems are referred to as the [...] "Three Brains" [...] or three centers of the intellectual animal, and are named Intellectual Center, the Emotional Center, and the Motor-Instinctual-Sexual Center. Each center is studied in relation to the types of energies or [...] "occult hydrogens" [...] that animate them, the frequency at which each center operates (sexual center being the fastest, then emotional, then intellectual), and how psychological aggregates form and act within each center: psychological aggregates that are expressed through the intellect one way and through the emotions in a different way, etc.|$|R
40|$|Normal puberty is {{the result}} of the {{maturation}} of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. <b>Primary</b> and secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> develop by the increase in the serum levels of gonadal steroids: oestradiol in girls and testosterone in boys. The main players in the process of normal puberty are the hypothalamus, by producing pulsatile Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone (GnRH), and the pituitary. GnRH influences the pituitary via the portal vein system and the pituitary secretes the gonadotrophins Luteinizing Hormone and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (LH and FSH). LH and FSH in turn stimulate the gonads to develop the cells essential for reproduction and to secrete the gonadal steroids. In girls this maturational process primarily leads to the development of the breasts and internal genitalia. Menarche follows as a result of ongoing maturation. In boys it results in growth of the testes, pubic and axillary hair, lowering of the voice and spermarche. In both sexes, a pubertal growth spurt occurs as well as further psychosocial and psychosexual development...|$|R

To this effect, stimuli of naked {{men and women}} with visible <b>primary</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics,</b> as well as dressed bodies, were presented to 20 heterosexual male and female participants while acquiring high resolution EEG data. The stimuli were either consciously detectable (supraliminal presentations) or were rendered non-conscious through backward masking (subliminal presentations). The N 1 event-related potential component was significantly enhanced in participants when they viewed naked compared to dressed bodies under supraliminal viewing conditions. More importantly, naked bodies of the opposite sex produced a significantly greater N 1 component compared to dressed bodies during subliminal presentations, when participants were not aware of the stimulus presented. A source localization algorithm computed on the N 1 showed that the response for naked bodies in the supraliminal viewing condition was stronger in body processing areas, primary visual areas and additional structures [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|In vertebrates, androgens are {{responsible}} for male <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> and behavior. Androgens exert their functions by interacting with the androgen receptor. This signaling pathway can be disrupted by exogenous chemicals that can either mimic or antagonize {{the actions of the}} hormones. In this study, the subcellular localization of androgen receptor from Zebrafish (Danio rerio) (zfAR) was studied by expressing the yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) -zfAR fusion protein in Hela and ZFL cell lines. Unliganded zfAR resides relatively even between cytoplasm and nucleus, and it undergoes nuclear translocation in response to the binding of ligands such as 11 -ketotestorsterone (11 -KT) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Mutations created by site-directed mutagenesis in the predicted nuclear localization sequence (KKCFEVGMTLGARKLRK) severely destroyed the 11 -KT induced nuclear translocation of zfAR. Furthermore, environmental antiandrogenic chemicals bisphenol A, p, p’-DDE, vinclozolin and fenitrothion did not induce nuclear translocation of zfAR alone, but significantly inhibited the 11 -KT induced nuclear import of zfAR at concentration 10 - 6 M. Combinational effects of these four chemicals were larger than effects observed with single chemical, but no cumulative effects could be concluded in this study...|$|R
2500|$|Given {{the various}} species of spiral-horned {{antelope}} the social organization varies between. The extreme {{ends of the}} spectrum are the predominately solitary bushbuck and {{at the other end}} the highly social giant eland. In general the herd size of spiral-horned antelopes are not large as they rarely exceed more than a few dozen individuals, and are mostly sedentary in nature. The herd composition is unisexual which is mostly females and their young. It is currently believed to be the reason why some spiral-horned antelopes practicing herd as a defense mechanism to protect the young predators. In the bongo and eland species this lead to the development of larger sizes in the females and horns, along with intense social hierarchical ranking (which is not seen in other species which it is only the larger males that dominate over the smaller females). With the exception of the mother and her calf there are no strong social bonds in the herd. These herds are sometimes very open and loosely defined as sometimes females come and go. Males born in the herd will remain in the herd until they developed their <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Once they have developed these traits males leave the herd and become nomads.|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this case is to give {{students}} some insight into scientific experimentation as they learn the biology of sexual differentiation. The case as written here would probably take three or four class periods to complete in its entirety. None of us used the entire case. Rather, we each used different parts of it in our courses, which had students with varying backgrounds: z In a core curriculum science course for non-majors and a course for future elementary school teachers, we had a unit on chromosomes and karyotyping. For these courses, we used Parts I, II, and III on chromosomal and gonadal differentiation, and Part VI on the social ramifications. Students completed each section in cooperative learning groups. The topic of genital differentiation was presented in an interactive mini-lecture (see the accompanying PowerPoint slides and notes for an outline of the mini-lecture). In these courses, students had previously learned about hormones and receptors {{in the context of}} blood glucose regulation. z For a genetics course, students had at least a basic knowledge of genes, autosomes, sex chromosomes, karyotyping, steroid hormones, and human <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b> z In a physiology class, where students already had a solid background in genetics and in th...|$|R
30|$|The {{process of}} ageing is {{associated}} with negative effects of mutations acting late in life, which range from those affecting cells to those affecting the whole organism. In many animal taxa, {{the deterioration of the}} phenotype with age also affects traits such as males’ <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b> In three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), males usually reproduce at one or two years of age. To see whether sexual selection has the potential to differ between young and old males, full-sib brothers of different age classes were compared, which were bred and raised under standardised laboratory conditions. During two simulated, successive breeding seasons males were allowed to build their nest in single tanks either in the first (“young males”) or in the second (“old males”) breeding season. A comparison of reproductively active brothers of the first and second breeding season showed that older males produce more but smaller sperm, which might be of lower quality. The fact that older males stored more sperm is size dependent as the results show that larger males possess a greater absolute testis mass, which is inextricably linked to sperm number. However, independent of body size, old males had a lower intensity of red/orange and UV breeding coloration as well as a reduced testis melanisation, which might have consequences in female mate choice and sperm competition.|$|R

40|$|Body {{image is}} seen as a central {{component}} to those who identify as transgender, that is, a feeling of incongruence between bodily features and assigned gender. Previous research has suggested high rates of body dissatisfaction within adolescent general population samples. Therefore, it is critical that clinicians are able to identify and disentangle distress related to gender and the body, from that of general body dissatisfaction. Furthermore, adolescent transgender persons are an understudied group in the psychological literature and many studies looking at body image in this population have been conducted using small sample sizes. The Body Image Scale (BIS) is used in gender services (GS) around the world and consists of 30 body features that the person is asked to rate in terms of satisfaction with those parts on a 5 -point scale. However, there are no studies currently published where the scale has been normed in control samples within young persons populations. This is an important clinical issue as the BIS is used as part of the assessment process in GS‟s. This quantitative study is an exploration of the similarities and/or differences in body-part satisfaction in a control sample (n = 262) and in those referred to the UK Gender Identity Development Service (n= 403) using the BIS. The BIS compares primary, secondary and neutral bodily characteristics as well as differences between the sexes and ages of participants between and within the two populations. Results showed persons with gender dysphoria were significantly more dissatisfied with their bodies than the control group. In addition, this dissatisfaction increased with age during pubertal development, particularly in the clinical group. In the clinical group, natal (biological) males were more dissatisfied with their <b>primary</b> and neutral <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics,</b> where as in the control group natal females were more dissatisfied than males across all <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Implications for research, service provision and clinical psychology practice are discussed...|$|R
