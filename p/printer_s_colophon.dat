40|$|In 2004, Andy Paparozzi of the National Association of Printing Leadership (NAPL) {{reported}} {{that it was a}} good year for the U. S. printing industry, because it was the first year since 2001 in which the industry showed growth. However, this good news cannot appease the complaints from U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers</b> who are concerned about losing their jobs to overseas printers. According to a survey conducted by the Printing Industries of America/Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (PIA/GATF), 40 % of printers think that their customers are seeking global sourcing for their printing needs. Offshoring is the new reality of globalization. Journalists constantly mention the benefits and dangers in offshoring. No one is really sure if offshoring is beneficial or not, or if it is just overwhelming the printing industry. For the following thesis, the researcher conducted two surveys. One targeted U. S. print buyers (buyers, brokers, and book publishers); the other survey targeted Chinese printers. This research discusses the following issues: • How do Chinese <b>printers</b> view U. <b>S.</b> offshore print buying trends? • How are Chinese printers planning to upgrade and to improve their capabilities to acquire and to handle offshore print jobs? • Is there a trend (an increase or a decrease) in offshore print buying from China? • How do U.

The research findings will benefit the U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers</b> by clarifying our understanding the print buyer’s behavior and reasons for purchasing their print offshore. With more accurate knowledge in this field, U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers</b> will be in a better position to know what it will take to become more competitive...|$|R

40|$|The {{author of}} the article {{combined}} findings published in other articles, archival sources and bibliographical analysis of several printed books by the Italian humanist man of letters and diplomat Giangiorgio Trissino in order to dispel the doubts about the identity of Trissino 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>printer</b> Bartolomeo Zanetti who used the pseudonym Tolomeo Ianiculo to hide his real name when working with Trissino. Bibliographical analysis of material (non-textual) elements of some Trissino 2 ̆ 7 s books available nowadays revealed that they were printed in a manner corresponding to Zanetti 2 ̆ 7 s printing style. When printing Trissino 2 ̆ 7 s works in 1529, Zanetti worked as a travelling and occasional printer without his own movable type, printing press {{and the possibility of}} regular supply of paper. All these circumstances were "imprinted" on his books, which allows us to "read" them historically. The {{author of the}} article was also interested in the reasons why Zanetti decided to reject the fame he could have shared with Trissino. At that time, printers were usually proud of their work as printing required the mastery of a more advanced technique than manuscript binding. In addition, printed items reached the masses, thus increasing printers 2 ̆ 7 fame and giving them the possibility of transcending their mortality, which was an important goal of a Renaissance man. The reasons for using a pseudonym were much deeper than in the case of Palladio - the pseudonym that Trissino assigned to the promising contractor Andrea di Pietro. They sprang from an environment imbued with espionage and conspiracy, with both characterizing Trissino and Zanetti 2 ̆ 7 s lives and work during an intense period marked by war and political intrigues. Only when reading "between the lines", one can put together a feasible and meaningful mosaic out of seemingly unconnected and arbitrary fragments of empirical "facts". What the two protagonists had in common was the knowledge of Greek and acquaintanceship with Greek scholars and medical circles, interest in calligraphy and printing, as well as in all activities necessary for intelligence and other secret services. The real identity of Trissino 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>printer</b> can be inferred with great certainty from the book on poisons and antidotes that features Trissino 2 ̆ 7 s signet and Zanetti 2 ̆ 7 s real name. Having been created in the information centre of anti-Venetian alliances during a huge scandal (I segretari del 1542) whose main agent - the French Ambassador Guillaume Pellicier - had financed its publication, the book also confirms the suspicion that they were both involved in the intelligence service. Therefore it can be concluded that by using Trissino 2 ̆ 7 s signet Zanetti wanted to protect himself as Venice had already forgiven the courteous man of letters and diplomat his pro-Habsburg sympathie...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the relationships between a standard color and its visually chosen limits. Commonly, limits or tolerances are communicated to printers using an Allen Tolerance Chart. The Allen Chart, used extensively by package printers, provides a standard of the color to be reproduced along with corresponding light and dark limits. A second form of tolerance chart, used by <b>printers</b> of U. <b>S.</b> Department of Transportation hazardous materials warning labels, provides limits for colors three dimensionally. Both types of tolerance charts were used in this study. Three Department of Transportation tolerance charts were measured spectrophotometrically producing a family of curves for the red, green and blue tolerance charts. The curves were then subjected to Eigenvector analysis to determine the similarity among the tolerances for each color. The results suggest the red and green family of curves are somewhat similar, but very different than the blue. Five hundred five Allen Chart standard colors and their light and dark limits were measured with a small spot colorimeter to determine the relationships between the standard colors and their customer allowed limits. The samples were also subdivided into those representing spot color printing and those representing process color printing. The study suggests the average allowable tolerance for light and dark limits and spot and process color was approximately six C. I. E. L*,a*,b* delta 2 ̆ 2 E 2 ̆ 2 units. Statistically the resu 1 ts indicate the light allowable tolerance is greater than the dark tolerance and the process color tolerances are greater than the spot, but for all practical purposes the differences are not significant.

40|$|Offshoring and {{offshore}} outsourcing, {{the movement of}} work and tasks to low-cost countries, has been increasing in scale and scope. Offshoring in the manufacturing sector has been an ongoing phenomenon for more than forty years. More recently, examples of offshoring in services industries such as software, once considered non-tradeable and therefore immune to offshoring, have emerged. The concurrent effects of very rapid growth of the Indian and Chinese economies and dramatically lower international cross-border transaction costs {{have the potential to}} change the structure of many industries. Some have called this as historic an economic transformation as the Industrial Revolution (Blinder, 2006). Offshoring has already transformed a number of industries. On the manufacturing side, in response to pressures from foreign competitors, U. S. semiconductor firms were {{able to take advantage of}} labor in low-cost countries by modularizing their value chains (Sturgeon, 2006). By modularizing, they could isolate pieces of the value chain and site them in the most efficient geographic locations. Very labor-intensive tasks such as assembly were first moved offshore, and later foundries were moved to more efficient locations, while high-level design was kept closer to customers (Brown 2 ̆ 6 Linden, 2005). Similarly the U. S. automotive industry has been able to improve its competitive position by moving some of its labor-intensive production to Mexico to lower its costs. On the services side, certain industries are being transformed very rapidly. In a span of about three years, the American IT services industry has adopted a “global delivery model,” in which customers expect bids on projects to have blended rates, including both on-site {{and offshore}} labor components. These projects do not reflect a simple division of labor, where the work completed on-site is high-skill and the offshore work is low-skill. Instead, major companies are creating product-specific centers in low-cost countries that will serve customers throughout the world. For example, IBM has announced that Bangalore will be the global home for its Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), a strategic business segment it expects will grow rapidly over the next decade (Global News Wire, 2006). The printing industry has characteristics similar to both manufacturing and services industries. Like manufacturers, printers produce tangible goods, but like services providers, the products delivered are often highly customized, requiring co-production by customer and printer. As a result, increased international cross-border trade, especially with China and India, will affect the printing industry in distinctive ways. The goal of this paper is to better understand how the offshoring phenomenon is playing out in the printing industry. Because of the high number of small firms in the printing industry and thus the lack of public data, and because of the complex nature of the industry itself, there is much to be understood about how offshoring is affecting U. <b>S.</b> <b>printers.</b> This problem is magnified for the lack of data on service offshoring (Sturgeon, 2006). Printers and their suppliers are keenly interested in how globalization and offshoring are impacting their industry. The fact that China and India have emerged as market sources as well as competitors has been a frequent topic in trade publications and industry conferences. In this paper we will offer a number of hypotheses, review descriptive survey data on the industry, test the hypotheses with this data, and expand these quantitative findings with interview data...|$|R
