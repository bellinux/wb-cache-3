40|$|For a long time, {{farmers in}} Nyanza and Western provinces in Kenya {{have had to}} deal with the Striga problem. To most of them Striga had become a way of life and they had given up hope. Striga affects their {{mainstay}} crops, which are maize, sorghum and mil- let. After an extensive search for a solution, IR maize was developed. However, like all new technologies, there is usually suspicion especially from the end user. A study was therefore conducted to find out the level of adoption and perception of farmers on this technology. This study also sought to identify the constraints in the deployment of this technology and arrest them on time. This report presents the findings of this study. The stratified random sampling method was used to select 10 districts, 16 sub- locations, 32 villages and 834 households. Two groups of farmers were investigated: baseline and WeRATE farmers defined on the basis of number of years of experience with IR maize. A combination of techniques for data collection was used, including literature review, interview of individual households and GPS recordings. Descriptive statistics (frequency of events and means of parameters) were applied for data analysis. Similarly, a binomial probit model was used to identify factors driving the perception of the various households on the IR maize technology. Findings from sampled households depict that most household heads are male. There were about 26 % of households headed by females. The level of education was low for the heads of households and other members of farm families. Group membership was high especially among women. Most households (89 %) had received extension visits while 68 % had attended field days, seminars and/or agricultural shows. Farming activities were found to provide a substantial amount of income to most households. Maize is the major food crop and a source of cash income to most households. Farmers grow both local and improved (hybrid) maize varieties, but the productivity of maize is low. There is a considerable gap between potential and actual maize yields. Major factors constraining maize production include Striga infestation, drought, erratic rainfall and low soil fertility. Striga is by far the major threat to livelihoods of smallholders. Traditional methods of Striga control which include uprooting, burning and manuring have proved to be ineffective. Although alternative technologies exist, they have not been highly adopted and used, possibly because of lack of awareness. Awareness of Striga and Striga control technologies was substantial among sampled households. All were aware of IR maize technology followed by traditional practices, and push-pull; the least known technology of Striga control was the intercropping of legumes followed by cassava/Desmodium. Extension agents from the Ministry of Agriculture and local NGOs were found to be the leading sources of information and demonstrations on various Striga control technologies, including instructions/ guidelines required before the application of IR maize technology. x Farmers’ assessment of maize yields under different Striga control technologies revealed that maize yields were higher where farmers used IR maize and <b>push-pull</b> <b>technologies.</b> The least maize yields were observed in fields under traditional Striga control technologies. Likewise, IR maize technology was superior in reducing Striga population in the fields and control of both biotic and abiotic factors. There were also some implications to the introduction of IR maize technology such as change in weeding times, capital requirement, carefulness in handling farming activities and social implications such as group formation and emergency of credit societies. The study identified critical ways to speed up the adoption of IR maize technology. The need to establish proper diffusion channels was suggested as an important component before full deployment of this technology. The need to bring IR maize seeds to stock- ists near to farmers, increase cultivated plots to IR maize and increase IR maize kit and more extension on the technology were highlighted as some of the ways to scale-up the IR maize technology in the region. Other factors that contribute to the positive perception of IR maize, thus to its diffusion and adoption, are farmer perceptions on agronomy attributes of the technology, the number of extension visits, the exposure to the technology, and the responsiveness of the technology to farmer needs...|$|R
40|$|Nanotechnology is an {{enabling}} technology {{that has an}} impact on electronics, computing, data storage, communications, materials and manufacturing, energy, environment, transportation, health and medicine, national security and space exploration. This paper talks about efforts across the United States for reaping the benefits of Nano Technology by commercialization through participation of multinational corporations and government funding and policy making. It is important to understand that nanotechnology is not any one technology or a one-sector technology. Its reach is extremely broad and hence it becomes important to understand the governing and regulatory bodies that form policies for Nano technology. These governing bodies are bureaucratic and hierarchical organization set up by the US government to develop Science and Technology Policy in different areas of Nano technology, to which the nationwide research and commercialization efforts are to be focused. Generally these policies tend to favors the Nation interest to generate revenue by commercialization of new technology and /or find solutions to current societal problem leveraging the innovations in Nano science and Technology. Ways to foster innovations in a new technology is a highly relevant and intricate question in the arena of policymaking. Various studies have shown that technology-push and demand-pull policies induce innovation. However, there another phenomenon that affect the science and technology policy making and finding solutions to societal problems. <b>Technology</b> <b>push-pull</b> are basically market driven strategy approach to create significant country-level innovation spillovers, which could drive national policymakers to engage in domestic market creation for e. g. creating smaller and faster I. C chips and memory drives. This could also be in align with Government’s vision to emerge as world’s super power in global innovation race and attract investors resulting in growth in economy. Policies to solve societal problems could be internal or global and the main mission is to find a sustainable solution to societal problem for e. g. finding cure for cancer using stem cell research. In this paper we evaluate nanotechnology research topics that align with stem cell research and create a roadmap for technology research for next 40 years. We discuss nanotechnology, nanotechnology drivers, federal governing agencies of USA that defines policies and market pull for nanotechnologies. We also have attempted to analyses one societal problem that might be answered by nanotechnology technology. We have chosen Stem cell based health improvement as our research topic to evaluate and design roadmap. The roadmap we have created is designed to embed policy and market implications that effects the technology selection. Also we have tried to align vision, mission and goals of NNI and its collaborating agency NIH to bridge the gap in interests that 2 NNI and NIH. We try to conclude that a good scientific and technology policy is required to provide a nurturing ambience, which acts as an incubator to nurture innovations in Nano technology...|$|R

50|$|The <b>push-pull</b> <b>technology</b> {{involves}} use of behaviour-modifying stimuli {{to manipulate}} the distribution and abundance of stemborers and beneficial insects for management of stemborer pests. It is based on in-depth understanding of chemical ecology, agrobiodiversity, plant-plant and insect-plant interactions, and involves intercropping a cereal crop with a repellent intercrop such as Desmodium uncinatum (silverleaf) (push), with an attractive trap plant such as Napier grass (pull) planted as a border crop around this intercrop. Gravid stemborer females are repelled from the main crop and are simultaneously attracted to the trap crop. Napier grass produces {{significantly higher levels of}} attractive volatile compounds (green leaf volatiles), cues used by gravid stemborer females to locate host plants, than maize or sorghum. There is also an increase of approximately 100-fold in the total amounts of these compounds produced in the first hour of nightfall by Napier grass (scotophase), the period at which stemborer moths seek host plants for laying eggs, causing the differential oviposition preference. However, many of the stemborer larvae, about 80%, do not survive, as Napier grass tissues produce sticky sap in response to feeding by the larvae, which traps them, causing their mortality. Legumes in the Desmodium genus (silverleaf, D. uncinatum and greenleaf, D. intortum), on the other hand, produce repellent volatile chemicals that push away the stemborer moths. These include (E)-β-ocimene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, semiochemicals produced during damage to plants by herbivorous insects and are responsible for the repellence of Desmodium to stemborers.|$|E
40|$|The <b>push-pull</b> <b>technology</b> (PPT) has widely been disseminated {{to control}} stemborer (Chilo partellus and Busseola fusca) and Striga weeds (Striga hermonthica and Striga asiatica) in maize fields in Kenya. This study {{examined}} farmers’ preferences for various dissemination pathways {{in order to}} proffer better targeting of resources in an optimal dissemination strategy. The pathways considered were public meetings (barazas), radio, farmer field schools (FFS), field days (FD), farmer teachers (FT), the fellow farmers (FF) and print materials. Using a weighted score index and ordered probit regression, the different pathways were sequentially ranked as FD, FT, FFS, FF, print materials, Radio, and barazas. Marginal effects from ordered probit showed that farmers had the least preferences for baraza and radio pathways. The farmer categories with the highest preference for particular pathways were: less educated farmers for FD, farmers with small land sizes for FT, farmers belonging to groups for FFS, and young educated farmers for the print materials. This information is extremely important for targeting the different segments of farmers. <b>Push-pull</b> <b>technology,</b> Stemborer, Striga, Dissemination pathways, preference, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|E
40|$|Food {{security}} attainment in Africa {{has been}} hindered by poor yields of cereals that serve both as staple and cash crops {{for the majority}} of smallholder farmers. Among the various constraints responsible for lower yields are the parasitic weed Striga, and Stemborer pests whose control has remained a challenge. The International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe) with partners developed a novel conservation agricultural technology termed ‘push-pull’, based on companion cropping that effectively controls both constraints simultaneously. However, the effects of climate change threatened its expansion into drier areas where Striga is rapidly spreading. Further adaptation of the conventional (original) <b>push-pull</b> <b>technology</b> was thus achieved through identification and incorporation of drought tolerant companion crops, and the procedure termed ‘climate-smart’ <b>push-pull</b> <b>technology.</b> With maximum adoption of the adapted technology, food security in the drier agro-ecologies would be enhanced through increased cereal yields. Adoption, however, depends on how well technology dissemination is implemented. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the potential adoption and impact of climate-smart <b>push-pull</b> <b>technology</b> ex ante in order to plan for its wide scale dissemination. Using a sample of 898 respondents (360 in Kenya, 240 in Tanzania, 298 in Ethiopia), multinomial logit and marginal rate of return (MRR) methods were used to analyze the findings of the ex ante baseline survey. These showed a high potential for adoption of climate-smart push-pull as 87. 8 % of the overall sample were willing to adopt; 92. 1 % in Tanzania, 88. 6 % in Ethiopia and 84. 3 % in Kenya. Gender, perceptions of Striga severity, technology awareness and input market access were the most likely factors that would positively influence the decision to adopt (marginal effects 0. 060, 0. 010, 0. 042, and 0. 738 respectively). The MRR was 109. 2 % for sorghum and 143. 4 % for maize, implying an expected positive impact to the community should they adopt the technology...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the push-pull technological innovation {{developed by the}} International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) in the UK and partners in East Africa, which addresses smallholder agricultural constraints, food insecurity, and environmental degradation and {{has the potential to}} equip farmers with the resilience and adaptability they need to deal with climate change. The <b>push-pull</b> <b>technology</b> fits conservation agriculture (CA) principles of minimum soil disturbance in its minimum soil tillage agronomic management, continuous soil cover with a perennial cover crop and plant residue, as well as a diversified cereal-legume-fodder intercropping strategy. The perennial intercrop provides live mulching, thus improving above-ground and below-ground arthropod abundance, agrobiodiveristy and the food web of natural enemies of stem borers, thus effectively controlling major insect pests of cereals. The field implementation of this technological innovation in Africa is discussed, as well as its various benefits...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores how {{farmers in}} three villages in South Wollo, Ethiopia, {{perceive}} {{the impacts of}} a particular farming technology. The technology is called the <b>Push-Pull</b> <b>Technology,</b> which is an agro-ecological method {{to address the problem}} of stemborer moth and Striga weed, which seriously affects the production of the important food crops maize and sorghum. It is agro-ecological in the way that it seeks a holistic solution that is beneficial for the yield size as well as for the environment and the humans involved. Since the technology is developed within agro-ecology, it also needs to be evaluated holistically. As yield increases have been recognised already, this study focuses on how the farmers perceive its socio-economic impacts using a livelihood approach. However, this thesis seeks not to be an evaluation. Rather, it uses qualitative methods to investigate some of the farmers’ perceptionsof the impacts of the method. This brings a better understanding of how a technology like this can be received, what values the farmers put to it and how it fits into their livelihoods...|$|E
40|$|Lepidopterous stemborers, and {{parasitic}} striga weeds {{belonging to}} the family Orobanchaceae, attack cereal crops in sub-Saharan Africa causing severe yield losses. The smallholder farmers are resource constrained and unable to afford expensive chemicals for crop protection. The <b>push–pull</b> <b>technology,</b> a chemical ecology- based cropping system, is developed for integrated pest and weed management in cereal–livestock farming systems. Appropriate plants were selected that naturally emit signaling chemicals (semiochemicals). Plants highly attractive for stemborer egg laying were selected and employed as trap crops (pull), to draw pests away from the main crop. Plants that repelled stemborer females were selected as intercrops (push). The stemborers are attracted to the trap plant, and are repelled from the main cereal crop using a repellent intercrop (push). Root exudates of leguminous repellent intercrops also effectively control the parasitic striga weed through an allelopathic mechanism. Their root exudates contain flavonoid compounds some of which stimulate germination of Striga hermonthica seeds, such as Uncinanone B, and others that dramatically inhibit their attachment to host roots, such as Uncinanone C {{and a number of}} di-C-glycosylflavones (di-CGFs), resulting in suicidal germination. The intercrop also improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, natural mulching, improved biomass, and control of erosion. Both companion plants provide high value animal fodder, facilitating milk production and diversifying farmers’ income sources. The technology is appropriate to smallholder mixed cropping systems in Africa. Adopted by about 125, 000 farmers to date in eastern Africa, it effectively addresses major production constraints, significantly increases maize yields, and is economical as it is based on locally available plants, not expensive external inputs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of the agricultural sector {{in many developing countries}} has been rated as below average, in particular the staple cereal crops whose productivity is limited by both biotic and abiotic factors. Furthermore, underperformance by the agricultural sector has in part been attributed to the inability of women to access resources, yet they represent a crucial resource in agriculture and the rural economy through their roles as farmers and entrepreneurs. These challenges can be overcome by understanding gender roles and perceptions, and aligning innovations to fit the preferences of specific gender. This study evaluated gender specific perceptions and the extent of adoption of a climate-smart <b>push–pull</b> <b>technology</b> for controlling stemborers, African witch weed (Striga spp.), and improving soil fertility in drier agro-ecological zones where these constraints are quickly spreading. The findings show that slightly higher percentage of women (98. 6 %) perceived the technology as effective compared to men (96. 7 %). Women also highly rated the beneficial attributes of the technology such as increased cereal production (97. 3 % of the women vs 94. 6 % of men), decline in Striga spp. weed (97. 2 % women vs 92. 4 % of men), increase in soil fertility (95. 9 % of women vs 90 % of men), increase in fodder production (94. 1 % of women vs 91. 3 % of men) and increase in cereal and fodder production even with drought (82. 3 % of women vs 66. 5 % of men). The findings show that, women who are the most vulnerable of the smallholder farmers, are bound to benefit from the technology, mostly because its attributes favors their (women) preferences...|$|E
40|$|Food {{insecurity}} is {{a chronic}} problem in Africa {{and is likely}} to worsen with climate change and population growth. It is largely due to poor yields of the cereal crops caused by factors including stemborer pests, striga weeds and degraded soils. A platform technology, ‘push–pull’, based on locally available companion plants, effectively addresses these constraints resulting in substantial grain yield increases. It involves intercropping cereal crops with a forage legume, desmodium, and planting Napier grass as a border crop. Desmodium repels stemborer moths (push), and attracts their natural enemies, while Napier grass attracts them (pull). Desmodium is very effective in suppressing striga weed while improving soil fertility through nitrogen fixation and improved organic matter content. Both companion plants provide high-value animal fodder, facilitating milk production and diversifying farmers’ income sources. To extend these benefits to drier areas and ensure long-term sustainability of the technology in view of climate change, drought-tolerant trap and intercrop plants are being identified. Studies show that the locally commercial brachiaria cv mulato (trap crop) and greenleaf desmodium (intercrop) can tolerate long droughts. New on-farm field trials show that using these two companion crops in adapted <b>push–pull</b> <b>technology</b> provides effective control of stemborers and striga weeds, resulting in significant grain yield increases. Effective multi-level partnerships have been established with national agricultural research and extension systems, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders to enhance dissemination of the technology with a goal of reaching one million farm households in the region by 2020. These will be supported by an efficient desmodium seed production and distribution system in eastern Africa, relevant policies and stakeholder training and capacity development...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of pain increases with age. However, pain is often inadequately managed in elderly people, which undermines quality of life. Pain {{has been associated}} with depression, sleep disturbances, impaired ambulation, and increased healthcare use and costs. Effective treatment of pain improves the overall quality of life. However, pain management is complicated by the presence of multiple co-morbidities in elderly people, which increases the likelihood of polypharmacy, and therefore increases the chance of potential drug-drug interactions. Polypharmacy is also associated with poor adherence to therapy. Age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes reduce the therapeutic index of drugs. Therefore, elderly {{people are more likely to}} suffer from adverse events and increased sensitivity to the analgesic properties of opioids. OROS® hydromorphone (Jurnista®) is a once-daily, extended-release formulation that uses the OROS® <b>push-pull</b> <b>technology</b> to provide controlled release of the semi-synthetic opioid hydromorphone. Compared with conventional immediate-release hydromorphone, OROS® hydromorphone provides more consistent delivery of hydromorphone with lower peak concentrations and less variability in plasma concentrations over time. The bioavailability of hydromorphone from OROS® hydromorphone is minimally affected by food or alcohol (ethanol). Hydromorphone is mainly metabolized in the liver and is excreted in the urine. Unlike morphine, hydromorphone does not have an active 6 -glucuronide metabolite. This metabolite of morphine can accumulate in the presence of renal failure; therefore, the lack of an active 6 -glucuronide metabolite makes hydromorphone a useful alternative to morphine in elderly patients with renal failure. However, hydromorphone is similar to morphine in that it is metabolized to hydromorphone- 3 -glucuronide, which may be neuroexcitatory. Because of its low plasma protein binding and low probability of interfering with the metabolism of other drugs, hydromorphone may be especially suitable for patients taking multiple medications. OROS® hydromorphone is an effective analgesic that is well tolerated and provides more stable plasma concentrations than immediate-release forms of hydromorphone. Its once-daily administration offers an advantage over immediate-release forms and longer-acting formulations that require twice-daily administration. This means OROS® hydromorphone will be more convenient for elderly patients and may improve adherence, resulting in improved pain relief and quality of life. ...|$|E
