They were taken by surprise and according to Portuguese sources the Dutch troops could not discharge even a single volley towards the Portuguese. To secure a victory, Mendonça sent his Ensign Major, Valentim Pinheiro, with four companies in a flanking maneuver to attack them in the rear.|$|E

These columns were carved so as to resemble the trunk and crown of a palm tree, which {{was regarded as a}} fertility and eternity symbol. According to Herbert Ricke, these columns represent the sacred <b>palm</b> <b>grove</b> of Buto.

500|$|... "Captain Francis B. Wai {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} extraordinary heroism in action, on 20October 1944, in Leyte, Philippine Islands. Captain Wai landed at Red Beach, Leyte, {{in the face}} of accurate, concentrated enemy fire from gun positions advantageously located in a <b>palm</b> <b>grove</b> bounded by submerged rice paddies. Finding the first four waves of American soldiers leaderless, disorganized, and pinned down on the open beach, he immediately assumed command. Issuing clear and concise orders, and disregarding heavy enemy machine gun and rifle fire, he began to move inland through the rice paddies without cover. The men, inspired by his cool demeanor and heroic example, rose from their positions and followed him. During the advance, Captain Wai repeatedly determined the locations of enemy strong points by deliberately exposing himself to draw their fire. In leading an assault upon the last remaining Japanese pillbox in the area, he was killed by its occupants. Captain Wai's courageous, aggressive leadership inspired the men, even after his death, to advance and destroy the enemy. His intrepid and determined efforts were largely responsible for the rapidity with which the initial beachhead was secured. Captain Wai's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{occupying the}} Hollandia area, Wai was {{assigned}} to X Corps of the Sixth United States Army {{in preparation for the}} invasion of the Philippines. On October 20, 1944, his division was paired with the 1st Cavalry Division within X Corps, and the two divisions made an assault landing at Leyte. When Captain Wai landed at Red Beach, the Japanese forces stationed on the island concentrated their fire on the waves of incoming troops from gun positions located in a <b>palm</b> <b>grove</b> bounded by submerged rice paddies. When Wai arrived on the beach in the fifth wave, he found the soldiers there to be leaderless, disorganized, and pinned down on the open beach. Assuming command, he moved through the rice paddies, without cover. [...] His demeanor and example inspired the other men to follow him. With deliberate disregard of his own personal safety, he advanced without cover to draw Japanese machine gun and rifle fire, thus exposing the locations of the entrenched Japanese forces. Systematically, the Japanese positions were assaulted and overcome. Wai was killed leading an assault against the last Japanese pillbox in the area.For his actions during the landing on Leyte, Wai was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. After the war, his remains were interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. His grave can be found in section Q, grave 1194.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{measurement}} of biomass {{can be obtained}} from remote sensing analysis and modelling, the impacts of which are related to oil palm cultivation in industrial plantations. Our study aims at producing a spatial model for oil palm biomass estimation, at different scales of spatial analysis. The study was carried out in the industrial plantations of the Cameroonian Society of <b>Palm</b> <b>Groves</b> (SOCAPALM). The developed methodology combined: (i) the mapping of <b>palm</b> <b>groves</b> (Kumar, 2015), (ii) the characterisation of <b>palm</b> <b>groves</b> (Gadal, 2013), (iii) biomass estimation, and (iv) the comparison of the obtained results with Spot 6, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI images from 2001 to 2015. The first results were obtained for the mapping of the SOCAPALM industrial <b>palm</b> <b>groves</b> between 2001 and 2015. The obtained maps were highly correlated (Kappa of 0. 91 for Spot 6, 0. 92 for Landsat 7 and 0. 82 for Lansat 8), however, {{because of the presence of}} mixed pixels, some confusion between oil palm and other classes were observed. One of the factors affecting biomass estimation is spatial accuracy. Several improvements have been suggested : (1) mapping <b>palm</b> <b>groves</b> at a subpixel scale using super-resolution mapping; (2) developing a classification system of cartographic products. The use of satellites images with different spatial resolutions may also help to generate new data taking into account the level of spatial analysis...|$|R

On every side the velvet, blue-black sky, with its blazing stars, sloped downwards to the vast, dun-coloured plain. The two were blurred into one at their point of junction.|$|E

The main part deals with the semi-wild <b>palm</b> <b>groves,</b> their classification, yield and ways of increasing yield. Botanical, phytopathological, economic and sociological factors concerning these <b>palm</b> <b>groves</b> were investigated. The main conclusion was that as the human population increased, the standard of living would fall more and more, unless better agricultural methods were introduced for the oil palm and other food and commercial crops. One such method is the replacement of <b>palm</b> <b>groves</b> by farmer's and commercial plantations of the oil palm and other perennial crops, and by arable land. This would be an expensive undertaking and would need sufficient knowledge of the work and much concern from the government and farmers...|$|R
