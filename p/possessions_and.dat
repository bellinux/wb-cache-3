40|$|This study {{examines}} how two writers deal with demonic <b>possession</b> <b>and</b> exorcism in their written works that {{both have a}} common theme, the same alleged case of <b>possession</b> <b>and</b> exorcism. By comparing these written works I explore if the authors share any common or varying theories on <b>possession</b> <b>and</b> exorcism and investigate if the common theme of the two books {{has contributed to the}} authors writing similar books. My results show that the two authors deal with demonic <b>possession</b> <b>and</b> exorcism differently, one has theological views of the phenomena but is sceptical of their role in the alleged case, whilst the other believes that demonic <b>possession</b> <b>and</b> exorcism can be explained using scientific theories and that they are phenomena that played a part in the alleged case. The two books are quite different. I conclude that both writers’ theories of the phenomena are dependent on the existence of the phenomenon of religion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Health {{ministries}} and providers are rapidly scaling up insecticide-treated nets (ITN) distribution to control malaria, yet <b>possession</b> <b>and</b> proper use typically remain below targeted levels. In Malawi, health facilities (HFs) are currently the principal points of ITN distribution, making {{it important to}} understand how access to these ITN sources affects ownership, <b>possession,</b> <b>and</b> use. The authors evaluated the association between proximity to HFs <b>and</b> ITN <b>possession</b> or use among Malawian children six to 59 months of age. Methods A household malaria survey undertaken in eight districts of Malawi during 2007 was used to characterize ITN <b>possession</b> <b>and</b> use. The location of each respondent's household was geocoded as was those of Ministry of Health (MoH) HFs and other health centres. Euclidean distance from each household to the nearest HF was calculated. Patterns of net <b>possession</b> <b>and</b> use were determined through descriptive methods. The authors then analysed the significance of distance and ITN possession/use through standard statistical tests, including logistic regression. Results Median distance to HFs was greater among households that did not possess ITNs and did not use an ITN the previous evening. Descriptive statistical methods confirmed a pattern of decreasing ITN <b>possession</b> <b>and</b> use with increasing distance from HFs. Logistic regression showed the same statistically significant association of distance to HFs, even when controlling for age and gender of the child, ratio of nets to children in household, community net <b>possession</b> <b>and</b> use, and household material wealth. Conclusions Strategies that exclusively distribute ITNs through HFs {{are likely to be}} less effective in increasing <b>possession</b> <b>and</b> use in communities that are more distant from those health services. Health providers should look towards community-based distribution services that take ITNs directly to community members to more effectively scale up ITN <b>possession</b> <b>and</b> regular use aimed at protecting children from malaria. </p...|$|R
