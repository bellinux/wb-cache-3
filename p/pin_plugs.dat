25|$|There {{are four}} ratings of {{plug and socket}} in BS546, (2A, 5A, 15A and 30A). Each has the same general {{appearance}} but they are different physical sizes to prevent interchangeability, they use pin spacing which is also different from the two <b>pin</b> <b>plugs</b> specified in BS 372, so earthed plugs will not fit into unearthed sockets, and vice versa. Plugs fitted with BS646 fuses have been optional since the original BS546:1934 with maximum fuse ratings of 2A in the 2A plug, and 5A in the 5A, 15A and 30A plugs. In practice most BS546 plugs are unfused with fused versions being unusual and expensive.|$|E
50|$|A {{closely related}} but {{different}} design {{is the so-called}} <b>pin</b> <b>plug</b> and matching <b>pin</b> jack. The <b>pin</b> <b>plug</b> designs resemble banana plugs, but without the spring on the male pin. Instead, these designs rely on spring action in the female jack, or tightly machined tolerances, to ensure good contact. The <b>pin</b> <b>plug</b> design was used where maximum density of connectors was desired (such as in pin plugboards), or a very compact connector was needed.|$|R

25|$|German Schuko {{socket outlets}} were once widely used {{alongside}} the British standard BS546 round <b>pin</b> <b>plugs</b> (both 3-pin and 2-pin varieties). However, {{both of these}} systems were replaced by BS 1363, standardised as Irish Standard IS 401 (Plug) and IS411 (Socket outlet). This standard eliminated incompatibilities between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and was chosen as it was completely incompatible with both the old Schuko or BS 546 installations and encouraged people to rewire their homes {{to comply with the}} new standard. It removed the possibility of connecting Class I (requiring an earth connection) appliances, to socket outlets that are either unearthed (ungrounded) or with incompatible earthing contacts â€“ e.g. 2-pin side-earthed Schuko plug will not make earth contact with a 3-hole, 5-amp BS 546 socket. This harmonisation occurred before the advent of pre-fitted 2-pin plugs on appliances destined for the European 220-volt market, which might have led to a different outcome. Until UK and Irish voltages were standardised at 230 volts in the 1990s, it was common for such plugs to be pre-fitted on appliances destined for the Irish market, although they were prohibited on appliances destined for the United Kingdom market. Both countries now require the pre-fitting of BS 1363 plugs on domestic appliances.|$|E

2500|$|Several early American {{electrical}} {{plug and socket}} arrangements were invented by Harvey Hubbell. On 26 February 1903 he filed two patent applications featuring 2-pin plugs and adaptors for using his plugs with existing designs of lamp sockets and wall receptacles. Hubbell's first plug design had two round pins which differed from those already in use in Europe in that {{the tips of the}} pins had annular detents similar to those of present-day jack plugs to positively retain a plug in its socket. [...] In one patent, US 774,250 a plug was used with a socket which screwed into a lampholder (like the early lampholder plugs). In the other patent US 776,326 [...] the same type of plug was used with various three-way adaptors that could be connected to lampholders or [...] "a receptacle of any ordinary type". Figures 2 and 4 of this patent show an adaptor plugged into {{what appears to be a}} [...] "Chapman" [...] receptacle. Hubbell evidently soon found the round pin design unsatisfactory as a subsequent patent US 774,251 filed on May 27, 1904 shows lampholder adaptors similar to those of his first patent for use with plugs having coplanar (tandem) flat pins. Hubbell's catalogue of 1906 includes various three-way adaptors similar to those shown in the US 776,326 patent, but modified for use with the coplanar flat <b>pin</b> <b>plugs.</b> The Chapman receptacle must have been in general use at the time, as it was the only type of non-lampholder receptacle for which adaptors were supplied. The 1906 catalogue says of the Chapman adaptor: [...] "The device avoids fastening the cords together as is necessary with the ordinary Chapman plug when used for more than one purpose." [...] This suggests that Hubbell's original invention was prompted by his observation of the problem that arose with the use of this sort of receptacle and plug. Gradually wall sockets were developed to supplement those that screwed into lampholders.|$|E
