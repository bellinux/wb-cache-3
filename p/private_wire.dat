40|$|In this thesis, I {{investigate}} private telegraphy {{from its}} {{rise in the}} late 1830 s to the advent of exchange telephony in the early 1880 s. In contrast to public telegraphy where telegrams were transmitted over a shared network infrastructure, private telegraphy was a direct, more immediate form of user-to-user communication delivered over <b>private</b> <b>wires.</b> My objective is to redress a historiographical distortion {{in the understanding of}} the Victorian telegraph created by the conflation of the concept of telegraph with telegram, and by the prominence given to the nationalisation of the telegraph industry in 1870 in the discourse of historians like Jeffrey Kieve or Charles Perry, thus obscuring the critical role played by private telegraphy in the history of communication. To begin with, I expose the dichotomy between public and private telegraphy by demonstrating the similarities and rivalry between telegrams and letters. I contend that this rivalry was an important factor behind the nationalisation. The extent to which private telegraphy was distinct from public telegraphy is demonstrated through a comprehensive history of <b>private</b> <b>wires</b> and the first domestic telegraph instruments. I track the development of <b>private</b> <b>wires,</b> from their inception at the hands of users of the telegraph to their assimilation by telephony, and show their versatility for diverse uses. I also reveal how telegraphic intercommunication systems – the so-called Umschalters – were reconfigured to become the Post Office’s first generation of telephone exchanges in the early 1880 s. From this novel perspective, I counter the received scholarly view that the Post Office obstructed the expansion of telephony to protect the Crown’s stake in telegraphy. I claim instead that the Post Office exploited the installed base of Umschalters and <b>private</b> <b>wires,</b> by then referred to as subscriber lines, to become an active participant in the nascent telephone industry alongside the private companies, thus accelerating the take-up of exchange telephony. ...|$|R

50|$|The 300 {{series was}} much more than just the Tele. 332. There was a whole range of {{similarly}} designed products. Fieldsets (Tappers), Headsets, Pendant Telephones, Wall Phones and the House Exchange System. Many Private Telephone Companies had sprung up in the UK. As these were banned by law from connecting to external lines, they contented themselves with producing systems for automatically dialling between company offices, within the same building or, via <b>private</b> <b>wires,</b> rented from the GPO, virtually anywhere. The GPO could only do this via PMBXs (manual switchboards), ranging from the 2 to 5 line cordless boards, via the 25 and 50 line plug and cord boards to the mighty PMBX 1A, which, with its modular construction, could be any size a large company might require. The GPO regarded the Private Telephone Companies as a thorn in their flesh and a great loss of potential income. They decided to tap into this lucrative market. Initially they produced a system virtually identical to the competition and called it the House Telephone System. This appeared, from the rear, like a Tele. 332 but the front sloped down and was covered in two rows of buttons, by which a few other, similar, extensions could be called. Like the competition this system was entirely internal and could not connect to the PSTN (Public Service Telephone Network). Unlike the competition, however, the number of extensions which could be incorporated was strictly limited. The GPO tried again.|$|R
50|$|In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell {{achieved}} {{the first successful}} telephone transmission of clear speech. The first telephones had no network, but were in <b>private</b> use, <b>wired</b> together in pairs. Users who {{wanted to talk to}} different people had as many telephones as necessary for the purpose. A user who wished to speak, whistled into the transmitter until the other party heard. Soon, however, a bell was added for signalling, and then a switch-hook, and telephones took advantage of the exchange principle already employed in telegraph networks. Each telephone was wired to a local telephone exchange, and the exchanges were wired together with trunks. Networks were connected together in a hierarchical manner until they spanned cities, countries, continents, and oceans.|$|R

The goals of PWE3 are similar in many ways {{to what we have}} known for over a decade as ‘multiservice.’ The difference is that Ethernet, IP and MPLS have replaced ATM as the fundamental switching and transport technology. PWE3 working group was originally formed in mid-2001, although pseudowires were originally known as <b>private</b> <b>wires</b> (a little-known fact). Even so, the ideas behind pseudowires did not originate in 2001. Axerra Networks has {{been at the forefront of}} envisioning multiservice using Ethernet, IP and MPLS since before 1999. Axerra coined the terms Multiservice over IP (MSoIP), Circuit Emulation Service over IP (CESoIP), Frame Relay over IP (FRoIP), and ATM over IP (ATMoIP) - and still owns the Internet domain names and trademarks for these terms. Thus, Axerra has been an early innovator of pseudowire technology and a leading contributor to the PWE3 standardization efforts rapidly reaching fruition in PWE3, as well as ITU-T, the Broadband Forum (BBF), and the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF), bode well for the adoption of pseudowire technology by the service provider industry. Axerra understands that pseudowire is simply a new term for the next generation of multiservice - multiservice over IP and MPLS. Based on its experience in this technology, predating even its new name, and based on contributions to these standardization efforts, Axerra is well positioned to lead service providers’ uptake of pseudowires networking.|$|R
