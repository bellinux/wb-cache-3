5|$|Parades {{are held}} {{for a range}} of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are {{designed}} to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. Cavalcades and the modern variant, the motorcade, are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the Trooping the Colour in 5) and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.|$|E
5|$|The Tower of Babble: Sins, Secrets and Successes {{inside the}} CBC is a Canadian non-fiction book written by Richard Stursberg. The {{book is a}} memoir {{detailing}} Stursberg's experience as the vice-president in charge of English services at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) between October 2004 and August 2010. Stursberg was recruited by CBC president Robert Rabinovitch who understood and supported Stursberg's intention to move the CBC's focus more towards producing popular content with success and failure defined {{by the number of}} <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>watch,</b> rather than awards or critical praise. The book covers a range of topics relating to CBC, including acquiring popular shows, like Little Mosque on the Prairie and Heartland, for CBC Television, modernizing news coverage at CBC News, adjustments to CBC Radio, and CBC Sports losing broadcasting rights to its competitors.|$|E

500|$|Not My Life {{addresses}} {{many forms}} of slavery, including the military use of children in Uganda, involuntary servitude in the United States, forced begging and garbage picking in India, sex trafficking in Europe and Southeast Asia, {{and other kinds of}} child abuse. The film also focuses on the people and organizations engaged in working against human trafficking. The film asserts that most victims of human trafficking are children. Actress Lucy Liu said that <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> Not My Life [...] "will be shocked to find [...] is happening in America." [...] Lucy Popescu of CineVue criticized the film for focusing on the victims, arguing that the perpetrators of trafficking should have been dealt with more prominently. Not My Life was named Best World Documentary at the Harlem International Film Festival in September 2012.|$|E
500|$|Because {{of their}} [...] "cuteness", videos of pet slow lorises {{are some of}} the most {{frequently}} watched animal-related viral videos on YouTube. [...] In March 2011, a newly posted video of a slow loris holding a cocktail umbrella had been viewed more than two million times, while an older video of a slow loris being tickled had been viewed more than six million times. [...] According to Nekaris, these videos are misunderstood by most <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> them, since most do not realize that it is illegal in most countries to own them as pets and that the slow lorises in the videos are only docile because that is their passive defensive reaction to threatening situations. [...] Despite frequent advertisements by pet shops in Japan, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre reported that only a few dozen slow lorises were imported in 2006, suggesting frequent smuggling. [...] Slow lorises are also smuggled to China, Taiwan, Europe, Russia, the United States, and Saudi Arabia for use as pets.|$|E
40|$|The {{possibly}} {{detrimental consequences}} of soft news are subject of popular and academic debate. This study investigates how watching particular news genres—soft versus hard—relates to cynicism about politics among Dutch citizens. A nuanced and novel scale measuring relative exposure to soft versus hard news is introduced using nonparametric unidimensional unfolding. The analysis of three public opinion surveys demonstrates {{a strong relationship}} between people’s position on this hard versus soft news exposure scale and political cynicism. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> relatively more soft news were more cynical about politics than <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> relatively more hard news. This relationship was not conditional on individuals’ level of political knowledge and interest...|$|R

Tim Winter, the President of the Parents Television Council, a socially conservative media monitoring organization and longtime critic of Family Guy, wrote to Matt Groening, Seth MacFarlane and Fox about a joke seen in the trailer for the episode. In it, after Bart's prank call to Moe asking {{for a man with}} an innuendo name, Stewie makes his own call and tells Moe that his sister is being raped. Winter felt that jokes about rape make it [...] "less outrageous in real life", and that <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> The Simpsons but not Family Guy would be unfamiliar with the latter show's brand of humor. A Fox spokeswoman {{declined to comment on the}} joke, while MacFarlane, interviewed by Entertainment Weekly, said that although he would be attacked for stating it as such, the joke was [...] "pretty funny... in context". A spokeswoman from the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network said [...] "I think the show is making it clear that rape is not funny by how they are positioning the joke." ...|$|E

[...] According to UN.GIFT, before Not My Life, there was [...] "no single communication tool that effectively depict the problem as a whole for a mass audience." [...] Susan Bissell, UNICEF's Child Protection Section chief, agreed with this assertion, and said that the film [...] "takes {{a close look at the}} underlying causality that so many other filmmakers have missed [...] it will change the way we see our lives, in some very fundamental ways." [...] She also said that Not My Life is an important documentary because it brings attention to underreported forms of abuse. A reviewer from Medical News Today praised the film for [...] "raising awareness and speaking about taboo subjects," [...] arguing that these activities [...] "are critical to empower families, communities, and governments to speak out honestly and take action against abuses." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first episode}} was behind only [...] {{as the most}} watched new show of the week, albeit in a week with fewer new shows because of the presidential debate coverage. Fox chose to debut Dark Angel instead of airing the first presidential debate, a move which TV analyst Marc Berman praised, saying: [...] "The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> the debates aren't the people who'll tune into Dark Angel anyway", though he {{predicted}} that the premiere's high ratings would not hold up as the show competed against more varied competition in subsequent weeks. It was the tenth most popular show overall that week, attracting 17.4 million viewers. Cameron {{said he did not}} know if the broadcast time change for the second season would have a positive or negative effect on the show's ratings, though R. D. Heldenfels of the Sun Journal noted the poor ratings of Friday night television, especially the low viewing rates among 18 to 24-year-olds, the age-group that Dark Angel was most popular with. The new time slot saw a ratings drop; for the 2001–02 season Dark Angel averaged 6 million viewers, ranking number 114 in the Nielsen ratings.|$|E

Ark Music Factory responded by saying it was disappointed that Black decided to have the video pulled from YouTube despite the two parties being in [...] "good faith negotiations". It added: [...] "There's been an ongoing, open dialogue with our company. So we were blindsided to get a 'Take Down Notice' alleging copyright infringement instead of a call or e-mail from Rebecca's representatives. Our use of the video has fully been authorized (as evidenced by four uninterrupted months and 160 million-plus viewings without objection) by both Ms. Black and the copyright holder. Regardless, {{we are going to continue}} to take the high road and work out the complaint as soon as possible, so that the million-plus <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> Friday for free each day can continue to enjoy the video."

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia in April 2009, and lasted for approximately 67 days. Many filming locations were established in Downtown Vancouver and its surroundings. Stage shooting for the film {{took place at the}} Canadian Motion Picture Park studio in Burnaby, an adjacent city that forms part of Metro Vancouver. Kosinski devised and constructed twelve to fifteen of the film's sets, including Kevin Flynn's safe house, a creation he illustrated on a napkin for a visual effects test. [...] "I wanted to build as much as possible. It was important to me that this world feel real, and anytime I could build something I did. So I hired guys that I went to architecture school with to work on the sets for this film, and hopefully <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>watch</b> the film feel like there’s a certain physicality to this world that hopefully they appreciate, knowing that real architects actually put this whole thing together." [...] The film was shot in dual camera 3D using Pace Fusion rigs like James Cameron's Avatar, but unlike the Sony F950 cameras on that film, Tron used the F35s. [...] "The benefit of ," [...] according to director Kosinski, [...] "is that it has a full 35mm sensor which gives you that beautiful cinematic shallow depth of field." [...] The film's beginning portions were shot in 2D, while forty minutes of the film were vertically enhanced for IMAX. Digital Domain was contracted to work on the visual effects, while companies such as Prime Focus Group, DD Vancouver, and Mr. X were brought on to collaborate with producer on the post-production junctures of Tron: Legacy.

40|$|The {{media are}} often blamed for electorates’ {{low levels of}} {{political}} knowledge and involvement, due to the tendency to cover political news in an increasingly entertaining manner. This study investigated whether and how watching particular news genres (soft or hard) relate to political cynicism. Using a novel and sophisticated measure for media exposure, analyses of three recent surveys found a strong relationship between watching certain news programs and political cynicism. <b>People</b> <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> serious news more often were less cynical about politics than <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>watched</b> popular kinds of news more often. This relation seems not to be conditional on differences of education levels, political awareness or newspaper readership. In short, this paper confirms what was already expected by many. Controlling for many potential confounding variables, there still exists a strong relation between the television programs people watch and their level of political cynicism...|$|R

[...] After receiving major backlash from fans, Gutfeld decided to take further shots by saying [...] "Two days ago I said that Red Hot Chili Peppers were the worst band on the planet.
