5|$|In mid-1961, President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam {{asked the}} United States to conduct aerial {{herbicide}} spraying in his country. In August of that year, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force conducted herbicide operations with American help. But Diem's request launched a <b>policy</b> <b>debate</b> in the White House and the State and Defense Departments. However, U.S. officials considered using it, {{pointing out that}} the British had already used herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s. In November 1961, President John F. Kennedy authorized the start of Operation Ranch Hand, the codename for the U.S. Air Force's herbicide program in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{relationship}} between Lie and Gerhardsen grew cooler. Gerhardsen was becoming far more amenable to the Soviets {{in part due to}} the influence of his wife, Werna, who was highly sympathetic to the Soviet Union (some even claiming she was a KGB informant). Gerhardsen had grown more and more frustrated at Lie's hard-line tactics against communists and perceived Soviet sympathisers, as well as his attempts to stifle foreign <b>policy</b> <b>debate</b> within the Central Committee. Lie on his part grew embittered over what he perceived was the Gerhardsen-couple protecting key leftists, such as Trygve Bull. According to Bull, Lie and Gerhardsen hardly spoke to each other after 1957.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Kevin Rudd {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following {{the failure of the}} Government's insulation program, controversy regarding the implementation of a tax on mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its carbon trading scheme and some <b>policy</b> <b>debate</b> about immigration policy. Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd. On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard had asked him to hold a leadership ballot the following day to determine the leadership of the Labor Party, and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Hal {{is riding}} {{the school bus}} home one day when he is {{approached}} by Ginny Ryerson, the articulate, competitive star of the debate team. She urges him to join her and replace her former partner, Ben Wekselbaum, who has {{dropped out of high}} school after falling silent mid-speech and losing the New Jersey State High School <b>Policy</b> <b>Debate</b> Championship. Though Hal initially declines, he finds himself besotted with Ginny and agrees to be her partner. Hal and Ginny begin to study for the upcoming tournament and form arguments on either side of whether the federal government should support the teaching of sexual abstinence in public schools. When Hal finds himself unable to talk during a practice debate, he runs out of the room and hides in the janitorial closet, where Ginny joins him. Hal kisses her hopefully, and they make out, but she subsequently falls out of contact with him. Ginny's parents assure him that she is confident with the work they have already completed and that she will meet him on the day of the debate.|$|E

This experimental research explores two effects of strategic news on public opinion: learning and political cynicism. The results indicate that, in comparison to issue-focused coverage, framing <b>policy</b> <b>debates</b> strategically does influence what people learn from the news but does not increase public cynicism...|$|R
