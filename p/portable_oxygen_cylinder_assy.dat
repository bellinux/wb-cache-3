Ten outpatients [median (range) FEV 10. 60 l (0. 35, 1. 45) ] performed the ESWT under five test conditions: baseline walk (no assistance), IPS at 14 cmH 2 O from a portable ventilator (the HIPPY, Friday Medical, U. K.), sham IPS (< 8 cmH 2 O), ambulatory oxygen at 2 lmin− 1, and sham <b>oxygen</b> (carrying the <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder</b> and breathing air). There were significant improvements in the ESWT with ambulatory oxygen, but a negative effect with the HIPPY device [mean (SD) time: baseline 172 (48) sec; oxygen 242 (62) sec; HIPPY 84 (35) sec]. The ESWT appeared sensitive to the effect of cylinder weight although differences in endurance capacity were not significant [sham oxygen 151 (45) sec]. The ESWT was sensitive to the acute application of oxygen, demonstrating a beneficial effect on endurance performance in patients with severe COPD. The ESWT could form the basis of a standardized assessment for ambulatory oxygen...|$|R
40|$|Long term {{continuous}} {{oxygen therapy}} improves {{prognosis in patients}} with hypoxaemic chronic airflow limitation. Transtracheal delivery of oxygen permits adequate oxygenation of such patients at lower flow rates than are required for delivery by nasal cannulas, thus increasing the time for which <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinders</b> can be used and improving the efficacy of domiciliary oxygen concentrators in patients with refractory hypoxaemia. In {{a study of the}} long term acceptability and risks of transtracheal oxygen in 37 patients, with a total follow up of 595 patient-months, most patients reported symptomatic benefit and four have used transtracheal oxygen successfully for more than four years. Problems have included surgical emphysema (4 patients), catheter fracture (9), local infection (34), and catheter dislodgement (21); but these have been relatively infrequent and in general have not caused important clinical problems. Transtracheal oxygen therapy was discontinued in 10 patients before death for various reasons, including infection (2 patients), catheter fracture (1), and surgical emphysema (1). Accumulation of mucus balls has not been a problem. It is concluded that transtracheal oxygen therapy is a safe and acceptable alternative to nasal cannulas in well motivated patients with hypoxaemia due to chronic airflow limitation who are keen to pursue an active life...|$|R

We evaluated {{the efficacy of}} low flow rates of supplemental oxygen for improvement of arterial oxygenation in anesthetized brown bears (Ursus arctos). The study included 32 free-ranging brown bears (yearlings, subadults, and adults; body mass 12 – 250 kg) that were darted with medetomidine-zolazepam-tiletamine (MZT) from a helicopter in Sweden. During anesthesia, oxygen was administered intranasally from <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinders</b> at different flow rates (0. 5 – 3 L/min). Arterial blood samples were collected before (pre-O 2), during, and after oxygen therapy and immediately processed with a portable analyzer. Rectal temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and pulse oximetry-derived hemoglobin oxygen saturation were recorded. Intranasal oxygen supplementation at the evaluated flow rates significantly increased the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2) from pre-O 2 values of 9. 1 ± 1. 3 (6. 3 – 10. 9) kPa to 20. 4 ± 6. 8 (11. 1 – 38. 7) kPa during oxygen therapy. When oxygen therapy was discontinued, the PaO 2 decreased to values {{not significantly different from}} the pre-O 2 values. In relation to the body mass of the bears, the following oxygen flow rates are recommended: 0. 5 L/min to bears < 51 kg, 1 L/min to bears 51 – 100 kg, 2 L/min to bears 101 – 200 kg, and 3 L/min to bears 201 – 250 kg. In conclusion, low flow rates of intranasal oxygen were sufficient to improve arterial oxygenation in brown bears anesthetized with MZT. Because hypoxemia quickly recurred when oxygen was discontinued, oxygen supplementation should be provided continuously throughout anesthesia...|$|R

High Alt Med Biol. 17 : 370 – 374, 2016. —Air travel {{is responsible for}} a reduction of the partial pressure of oxygen (O 2) {{as a result of}} the decreased barometric pressure. This hypobaric hypoxia can be dangerous for passengers with respiratory diseases, requiring initiation or intensification of oxygen therapy during the flight. In-flight oxygen therapy can be provided by <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentrators, which are less expensive and more practical than <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinders,</b> but no study has evaluated their capacity to concentrate oxygen under simulated flight conditions. We tested four <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentrators during a bench test study. The O 2 concentrations (FO 2) produced were measured under three different conditions: in room air at sea level, under hypoxia due to a reduction of the partial pressure of O 2 (normobaric hypoxia, which can be performed routinely), and under hypoxia due to a reduction of atmospheric pressure (hypobaric hypoxia, using a chamber manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space). The FO 2 obtained under conditions of hypobaric hypoxia (chamber) was lower than that measured in room air (0. 92 [0. 89 – 0. 92] vs. 0. 93 [0. 92 – 0. 94], p[*]=[*] 0. 029), but only one <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> concentrator was unable to maintain an FO 2 ≥ 0. 90 (0. 89 [0. 89 – 0. 89]).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> {{systems are}} {{commonly}} preferred by patients over compressed-oxygen systems that use E-size cylinders. However, cost is often {{perceived as a}} barrier to the prescription of lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> systems. OBJECTIVE: To compare the overall health-care costs of patients with COPD who used lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> systems to those who used E-cylinder systems. METHODS: All the patients who used either a lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> system, an E-cylinder system, or an E-cylinder system, then a lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> system, for at least 12 months during the study period (January 1, 1999, to December 30, 2004) were identified from the administrative database of our regional managed-care system. All direct medical utilization and costs were captured for at least the first 12 months that supplemental oxygen was dispensed. Other clinical factors that affect costs (including age, sex, ethnicity, and comorbidities) were examined and adjusted for. RESULTS: Of the 2, 725 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 203 used only a lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> system, 2, 268 used only an E-cylinder system, and 254 switched from an E-cylinder system to a lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> system. Among the patients who used only the lightweight <b>portable</b> <b>oxygen</b> system, the median total medical costs in the first year were nonsignificantly lower than those who used an E-cylinder system ($ 6, 515 /y vs $ 9, 503 /y). The cost difference remained nonsignificant after adjustment for clinical factors.

Chemical composition analysis, mechanical properties, metallographic tests and spectrum {{analysis of the}} cylinder fragments have been carried out. Based {{on the fact that}} the explosion is concluded as a chemical explosion because of grease. Filling grease into <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder</b> was due to misuse. Violent oxidation exothermic reaction occurred when grease was exposed to pure high-pressure oxygen. The instantaneous releasing of heat produced extreme high temperature and extreme high pressure in the cylinder, which exceeded its limits and caused burst. During the process for risk, pressure gauge shows that cylinder explosion occurred while <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder</b> is charged to 13. 5 MPa.

The primary aims {{of this study}} were to develop a predictive in vitro model for inhaled oxygen delivery using a set of realistic airway replicas, and to compare PF for a commercial POC with steady flow (SF) from a compressed <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Methods: Experiments were carried out using a stationary compressed <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinder,</b> a POC, and 15  adult nasal airway replicas based on airway geometries derived from medical images. Oxygen delivery via nasal cannula was tested at PF settings of 2. 0 and 6. 0, and SF rates of 2. 0 and 6. 0  L/min. A test lung simulated three breathing patterns representative of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient at rest, during exercise, and while asleep. Volume-averaged fraction of inhaled oxygen (FiO 2) was calculated by analyzing oxygen concentrations sampled at the exit of each replica and inhalation flow rates over time. POC pulse volumes were also measured using a commercial O 2 conserver test system to attempt to predict FiO 2 for PF. Results: Relative volume-averaged FiO 2 using PF ranged from 68 % to 94 % of SF values, increasing with breathing frequency and tidal volume. Three of 15  replicas failed to trigger the POC when used with the sleep breathing pattern at the 2. 0 setting, and four of 15  replicas failed to trigger at the 6. 0 setting. FiO 2 values estimated from POC pulse characteristics followed similar trends but were lower than those derived from airway replica experiments. Conclusion: For the POC tested, PF delivered similar, though consistently lower, volume-averaged FiO 2 than SF rates equivalent to nominal PF settings. Assessment of PF oxygen delivery using POC pulse characteristics alone may be insufficient; testing using airway replicas is useful in identifying possible cases of failure and may provide a better assessment of FiO 2.

40|$|Since 1988 {{the liquid}} oxygen system has {{increasingly}} {{been used in}} the Netherlands as an oxygen source by patients using long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). Irre-spective of the type, the system consists of a large canister for stationary use and a small one for portable use. Com-pared to <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinders</b> and the <b>oxygen</b> concentrator, the liquid oxygen system has several advantages such as its convenience for home use and the light weight and high capacity of the portable canister [1 – 3]. A benefit reg-ularly mentioned by oxygen companies is the reliability of the system. Although technical malfunctioning does not seem to occur more frequently than with oxygen cylin-ders, there have been some reports on the inaccuracy of the delivered oxygen flow [4, 5]. Furthermore, some of our patients had the impression that they received less oxygen at the same flow rate when they changed from <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinders</b> to the liquid oxygen system. In two patients the portable canister even supplied oxygen for a much longer period than predicted. The oxygen flow rate delivered may be less than intended owing to the inaccu-racy of the set flow rates or {{as a result of the}} outflow resistance caused by the humidifier, oxygen tubing, deliv-ery device and oxygen conserving devices, especially since the maximum outlet pressure of the liquid oxygen system is only half of that of <b>oxygen</b> <b>cylinders</b> (~ 300 kPa) [4, 5].
