5|$|In September 2012, the Swiss {{government}} gave banks like Credit Suisse {{permission to}} provide information to the US Justice Department for tax evasion probes. In February 2014 it agreed to pay a fine of $197 million after one of its businesses served 8,500 US clients without registering its activities, leading to suspicion {{as to whether it}} was helping Americans evade taxes. It was one of 14 Swiss banks under investigation. Separately, in 2013, German authorities began to probe Credit Suisse, its <b>private</b> <b>bank</b> subsidiary Clariden Leu, and its regional subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank for helping German citizens evade taxes. The bank eventually entered into a €150 million settlement with the government.|$|E

5|$|During Madagascar's First Republic, France heavily {{influenced}} Madagascar's economic planning and policy {{and served as}} its key trading partner. Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice, coffee, cattle, silk and palm oil. Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was {{a key factor in}} launching the socialist-Marxist Second Republic, in which the formerly <b>private</b> <b>bank</b> and insurance industries were nationalized; state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles, cotton and power; and import–export trade and shipping were brought under state control. Madagascar's economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell, industrial production dropped by 75percent, inflation spiked and government debt increased; the rural population was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels. Over 50percent of the nation's export revenue was spent on debt servicing.|$|E

In September 2016, Moody's cut Turkey's sovereign debt to junk status.

5|$|Ever {{since its}} {{establishment}} Girdap served political interests, {{and it was}} later tied to the Popular Liberal Party of Stefan Stambolov. On the other hand, the Bulgarian Commercial Bank (Balgarska targovska banka), which was also founded in Ruse in 1885, {{was close to the}} Popular Party. The two banks competed for lending municipal loans and regularly used their political ties in their competition. These relations were often damaging to the Bulgarian treasury, as politicians who were also bank shareholders or somehow related to Girdap awarded contracts based on their personal interest rather than that of the state. As the Bulgarian economy consolidated {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century and the emerging industry required increasing funds, local banks grew in importance. In 1911 Girdap had a capital of 2 million leva and by 1912 it was the third-largest <b>private</b> <b>bank</b> in the Kingdom of Bulgaria after the Bulgarian Commercial Bank and the Deutsche Bank-related Credit Bank (Kreditna banka). However, Bulgaria's privately owned banking sector remained comparatively small.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to research}} the <b>private</b> <b>banking</b> consumer perception and to analyse the impact acquisition in <b>private</b> <b>banking</b> has or might have on <b>private</b> <b>banking</b> consumer perception. A literature review discovered that existing {{research in the field}} of <b>private</b> <b>banking</b> consumer perception is relatively rare and no studies were discovered that dealt with <b>private</b> <b>banking</b> consumer perception and, in particular, the influence of an acquisition. In addition to that, <b>private</b> <b>banking</b> consumer perception is not defined by any literature. Hence, there is a gap in existing literature and the literature review resulted in research questions which were analysed and discussed by gathering primary data. A holistic case study based on the Swiss and German <b>private</b> <b>banking</b> market was used to gather primary data. This type of case study offers the researcher a holistic view(Patton, 1990) on the present subject as it considers all parties which have an influence on the topic under investigation. The first phase of the case study consisted of nonparticipant observation at a finance fair. <b>Private</b> <b>banking</b> consumers, relationship managers and consultants were observed. In the next phase semi-structured interviews were undertaken with relationship managers, <b>banking</b> managers, <b>private</b> <b>banking</b> clients and lawyers. Both phases were qualitative in its nature. Based on the findings it was established that <b>private</b> <b>banking</b> consumers have expectations on <b>private</b> <b>banking.</b> If the <b>private</b> <b>banking</b> service provider is able to fulfil or exceed these expectations the client perceives this as "satisfaction". Determinants of <b>private</b> <b>banking</b> consumer perception were elicited. These determinants are defined as categories and sub-categories of different criteria used by the consumer to evaluate a perceived service. Apart from that, the research findings revealed that acquisition can influence all <b>private</b> <b>banking</b> consumer perception determinants depending on the context of the acquisition. The independent advice of <b>private</b> <b>banks</b> as well as retaining the relationship manager was found to be of primary concern to the clients during an acquisition process. A model of <b>private</b> <b>banking</b> consumer perception was developed from the primary data results. With the knowledge gained from this research <b>private</b> <b>banks</b> are better able to understand bank consumers’ expectations and perceptions. This contributes to higher levels of competitiveness for banks as customers’ needs can be better met, and client movements during an acquisition process reduced...|$|R

25|$|In {{any given}} time period, the {{government}}’s budget can be either in deficit or in surplus. A deficit occurs when the government spends more than it taxes; and a surplus occurs when a government taxes more than it spends. MMT states that {{as a matter of}} accounting, it follows that government budget deficits add net financial assets to the private sector. This is because a budget deficit means that a government has deposited more money into <b>private</b> <b>bank</b> accounts than it has removed in taxes. A budget surplus means the opposite: in total, the government has removed more money from <b>private</b> <b>bank</b> accounts via taxes than it has put back in via spending.|$|E
