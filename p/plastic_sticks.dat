40|$|Background: Most popular {{single-use}} acupuncture needles {{consist of}} a stainless steel shaft with a handle made of copper coil or <b>plastic</b> <b>stick.</b> Objectives: To determine {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of these two handle types for needle buckling. Methods: The buckling load for acupuncture needles with these two different handle types was determined using a digital scale, and the stiffness of stainless steel wires used in different types of acupuncture needles was measured using a Dynamic Mechanical Analysis machine. Results: This study showed that an acupuncture needle with a copper coil handle was far more susceptible to buckling than a needle with a <b>plastic</b> <b>stick</b> handle. The average buckling force of acupuncture needles with <b>plastic</b> <b>stick</b> handles was 46. 7 % higher than that with copper coil handles for needles of 0. 25 mmx 30 mm, and 30. 8 % higher for needles of 0. 25 mmx 60 mm. Replacing a copper coil handle with a <b>plastic</b> <b>stick</b> handle could save about 100 tonnes of copper wires and 20 million metres of medical grade stainless steel wire a year worldwide. Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that the common practice of using coiled copper for handles on acupuncture needles should be re-evaluated. Replacing a copper coil handle with a <b>plastic</b> <b>stick</b> handle would significantly reduce needle buckling and improve patient comfort and safety. This would also reduce the consumption of copper and medical grade stainless steel wire considerably...|$|R

5000|$|The rest of a samba-reggae band {{is usually}} {{composed}} primarily of snare drums (caixas), and repiniques (a slightly longer, high-pitched drum with no snare/strings; also called [...] "repique"). These {{may play a}} reggae backbeat, son clave, bossa clave, [...] "Brazilian clave" [...] (Mocidade/merengue style), or {{a variety of other}} clave patterns, depending on the particular piece of music being played. Samba-reggae repiniques are typically 25-cm or 20-cm (10-inch, 8-inch) in diameter so are slightly smaller-diameter than the 30-cm (12-inch) repiniques of Rio, and are worn lower down on the body, and are played with two long <b>plastic</b> <b>sticks.</b> The repinique may also play loud variations, rolls, and improvisation fills, similar {{to the role of the}} third surdo in Rio-style samba. It also plays call-ins to start the entire band. Typically only 1 lead repinique player does these fills and calls; other players do not alter their parts outside of their set arrangement. A drum leader, or mestre, leads the entire band with hand cues and/or a whistle. In Olodum, the mestre typically leads with hand cues only and no whistle; this was Neguinho's style of leading.|$|E

30|$|Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) {{was used}} as a model for biofilm-forming {{bacteria}} in all the experiments. Typically, biofilms are prepared in vitro using 96 -well microplates made of polystyrene (Nunclon Δ surface, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). Therefore, this plastic surface {{was used as}} a reference substrate to compare the biofilm formation with those observed for the paper substrates. Bacterial cultivation and biofilm forming experiments on 96 -well microplates were conducted as previously described (Sandberg et al. [2008]). Briefly, bacteria were cultured in 30 g/L Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) (Fluka Biochemika, Switzerland) under aerobic conditions at 37 °C for 4 hours and 200 rpm to reach exponential growth, up to a concentration of 108 CFU/mL. To promote biofilm formation, a bacterial suspension (106 CFU/mL, 200 μL/well, in TSB) was added into 96 -well microplates and they were incubated for 18 h under aerobic conditions (37 °C, 200 rpm) as described earlier (Sandberg et al. [2008]). Paper-based substrates were used in a pattern of 4 well diameters (5 mm each). Biofilm formation in the paper substrates was monitored using a modified microtiter well plate assay. The substrates were placed in 6 -well microplates, into which suspensions of exponentially grown bacteria (106 CFU/mL, 5 mL/well, in TSB) were added and biofilms were similarly allowed to be formed at 37 °C, 200 rpm for 18 h. The total substrate area where biofilms could be formed in the printed substrates was calculated to be 0.784 cm 2. At the end of the incubation period, the suspensions were removed from the plates and the substrates were transferred to sterile 6 -well plates for visualization with AFM. Parallel samples were rinsed in sterile water (by immersion for a few seconds) and biofilms were scraped off the substrates in 100 μL TSB using sterile <b>plastic</b> <b>sticks</b> and rinsed with additional 100 μL of TSB. To disperse the bacterial aggregates, samples were immersed in a high power ultrasonic bath (Bandelin Sonorex Digitec) using an in-house built-in device that allowed them to be in full contact with water without touching the bottom surface of the sonicator. The sonication time was kept short (5 min, 35 kHz) and performed at RT. The disaggregated biofilms were serially diluted, spread onto Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The morphology of the resulting bacterial colonies was inspected and confirmed to be S. aureus. The inclusion of paper controls that were inoculated only with media, allowed the exclusion of potential contamination.|$|E
40|$|The {{life of a}} preterm infant {{admitted}} to a neonatal intensive care unit may be stressful {{from the moment of}} birth. Ever since Hans Selye’s initial characterisation of the biological stress response, cortisol has been frequently measured as an indicator of stress responsivity. However, research of the stress response and cortisol in infants, especially those who are preterm and/or ill, has been scarce basically because of methodological issues. The first aim with this thesis was to investigate the acute stress response, as measured by salivary cortisol and behaviour, for preterm infants, healthy infants, and infants at high psychosocial risk in response to certain defined handling procedures. The second aim was to investigate the stress response, as measured by salivary cortisol and psychometric measures, for parents present during the handling procedure of their infants. The intention was to perform all investigations in an as naturally occurring situation as possible, which means that the studied procedures would have been performed irrespectively of the research. The present thesis includes six original articles. The results of the first study demonstrate that it is feasible to collect sufficient amounts of saliva and to analyse salivary cortisol in neonates using the presented method of collection and analysis. The second study shows that preterm infants, usually cared for in incubators, show no signs of discomfort and have variable cortisol responses during skin-to-skin care with their mothers. The mothers, however, experience stress and low control before their first skin-to-skin care with their preterm infant and do not relax completely until after the session. In the third study we found that preterm infants have higher baseline salivary cortisol as compared to healthy full-term infants. Moreover, preterm infants have higher and sustained pain response during a nappy change as compared to healthy full-term infants. The results of the fourth study shows that infants younger than three months, living in psychosocial high-risk families, have increased cortisol responses during a nappy change, performed by the mother. However, support with the aim of improving mother-infant interaction, dampens the stress response. The results of the fifth study show that oral sweet-tasting solution in combination with a pacifier dampen the levels of the stress hormone cortisol in three months old infants during routine immunisation. Moreover, parents experience more self-rated emotional stress before immunisation if it is their first child who is being immunised. The sixth paper shows that the material used for saliva collection (cotton buds with wooden or <b>plastic</b> <b>sticks)</b> is of importance when saliva is collected but for practical reasons not centrifuged within 24 hours prior to cortisol analyse. The present thesis shows that it is practically feasible to collect saliva and to analyse the stress hormone cortisol in infants. The interpretation of infants’ and parents’ salivary cortisol responses to different handling procedures are discussed in relation to shortand long-term consequences, neonatal intensive care, preterm birth, attachment, mood, and pain...|$|E

The assay covers 10 mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene, and is based on mutant-enriched PCR followed by reverse-hybridization of biotinylated amplification products to an array of sequence-specific probes immobilized on the tip of a rectangular <b>plastic</b> <b>stick</b> (biochip). Biochip hybridization identified 17 (21 %) samples to carry a KRAS mutation of which 16 (33 %) were adenocarcinomas and 1 (3 %) was a squamous cell carcinoma. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Using 10 ng of starting DNA, the biochip assay demonstrated a detection limit of 1 % mutant sequence in a background of wild-type DNA.
