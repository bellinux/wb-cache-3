5|$|Cædwalla {{was wounded}} during {{the conquest of}} the Isle of Wight, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> this reason he abdicated in 688 to travel to Rome for baptism. He reached Rome in April 689, and was baptised by Pope Sergius I on the Saturday before Easter, dying ten days later on 20 April 689. He was succeeded by Ine.|$|E
5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that I was still {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>for</b> the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
5|$|Parental care {{is found}} in a few species of beetle, <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> {{protection}} against adverse conditions and predators. The rove beetle Bledius spectabilis lives in salt marshes, so the eggs and larvae are endangered by the rising tide. The maternal beetle patrols the eggs and larvae, burrowing {{to keep them from}} flooding and asphyxiating, and protects them from the predatory carabid beetle Dicheirotrichus gustavi and from the parasitoidal wasp Barycnemis blediator, which kills some 15% of the larvae.|$|E

5|$|Bony crests {{are found}} on the skulls of many theropods, {{including}} many tyrannosaurids. Alioramus, a possible tyrannosaurid from Mongolia, bears a single row of five prominent bony bumps on the nasal bones; a similar row of much lower bumps is present on the skull of Appalachiosaurus, {{as well as some}} specimens of Daspletosaurus, Albertosaurus, and Tarbosaurus. In Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus, there is a prominent horn in front of each eye on the lacrimal bone. The lacrimal horn is absent in Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which instead have a crescent-shaped crest behind each eye on the postorbital bone. These head crests may have been used for display, <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> species recognition or courtship behavior.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{necklaces}} features lion-headed terminals, {{and another}} includes stylized dolphins. The other four are relatively plain loop-in-loop chains, although {{one has a}} Chi-Rho symbol (☧) on the clasp, the only Christian element in the jewellery. Necklaces of similar lengths would normally be worn in the Roman period with a pendant, but no pendants {{were found in the}} hoard. The three rings were originally set with gems, which might have been natural gemstones, or pieces of coloured glass; however, these were taken from the rings before they were buried, <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> reuse. The rings are of similar design, one with an oval bezel, one with a circular bezel, and one with a large oblong bezel.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} {{contribution of}} the Morea scientific expedition was in effect its quasi-disinterest in pillage and treasure hunting. Blouet refused to perform excavations that risked damaging the monuments, and banned the mutilation of statues {{with the intent of}} taking a piece separated {{from the rest of the}} statue without regard. It is <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> this reason that the three metopes of the temple of Zeus discovered at Olympia were brought back in their entirety. In any case, this willingness to protect the integrity of monuments undoubtedly represented an epistemological progress.|$|E

5|$|The {{same year}} Gaudí was {{consulted}} about {{the construction of}} a monumental train station for Barcelona (the future Estació de França). Gaudí suggested an iron structure {{in the form of a}} large suspended awning, a solution quite ahead of its time; <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> this reason, it put the head engineers off, and they declined Gaudí's offer. The last known projects by the architect are the chapel for the Colónia Calvet in Torelló, of 1923, and a pulpit for Valencia (the exact location is unknown), of 1924. From then on, Gaudí worked exclusively on the Sagrada Família until his death.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human settlement at Little Thetford since the Neolithic Age. A 1996 search along the Anglian Water pipeline at Little Thetford—Cawdle Fen uncovered an important and unusually dense concentration of late Neolithic (3000–2201BC) remains. This is unusual because, although the fenland basin was dry and forested during the Mesolithic era, the area was sometimes subject to marine incursions, and at other times, fresh-water flooding. This led to marshes and open water areas {{which may have been}} difficult to settle on—except <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> seasonal activity. A Neolithic polished flint axe (4000–2201BC) was found in the village in 1984 at Bedwell Hey Farm. Fourteen pre-Roman flints of various finishes were also discovered in 1998 at the same site.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that these plants that have evolved protocarnivorous habits {{typically}} reside in habitats {{where there is a}} significant nutrient deficiency, but not the severe deficiency in nitrogen and phosphorus seen where true carnivorous plants grow. The function of the protocarnivorous habit, however, need not be directly related to lack of nutrient access. Some classic protocarnivorous plants represent convergent evolution in form but not necessarily in function. Plumbago, for example, possesses glandular trichomes on its calyces that structurally resemble the tentacles of Drosera and Drosophyllum. The function of the Plumbago tentacles is, however, disputed. Some contend that their function is to aid in pollination, adhering seeds to visiting pollinators. Others note that on some species (Plumbago auriculata), small, crawling insects have been trapped in the Plumbagos mucilage, which supports the conclusion that these tentacles could have evolved to exclude crawling insects and favor flying pollinators for greater seed dispersal or <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> protection against crawling insect predators.|$|E

5|$|Offa was King of Mercia, {{a kingdom}} of Anglo-Saxon England, from 757 {{until his death}} in July 796. The son of Thingfrith and a {{descendant}} of Eowa, Offa came to the throne after a period of civil war following the assassination of Æthelbald. Offa defeated the other claimant, Beornred. In the early years of Offa's reign, it is likely that he consolidated his control of Midland peoples such as the Hwicce and the Magonsæte. Taking advantage of instability in the kingdom of Kent to establish himself as overlord, Offa also controlled Sussex by 771, though his authority did not remain unchallenged in either territory. In the 780s he extended Mercian supremacy over most of southern England, allying with Beorhtric of Wessex, who married Offa's daughter Eadburh, and regained complete control of the southeast. He also became the overlord of East Anglia and had King Æthelberht II of East Anglia beheaded in 794, <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> rebelling against him.|$|E
