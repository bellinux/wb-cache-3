500|$|Born at Folkingham Castle, {{the eldest}} son of Henry Beaumont, 5th Baron Beaumont, and {{orphaned}} {{by the age of}} four, Beaumont became Henry V's ward, who quickly put him in the custody of Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester.

He was first summoned to parliament as Lord Beaumont in 1431, and at some point between 1425 and 1436 he married Elizabeth Phelip. She was the daughter and heiress of Sir William Phelip, a knight of the Garter who was recognised as sixth Lord Bardolf. On his death in 1441, his large East Anglian estates went to his daughter, and so to Viscount Beaumont. This made him a leading figure in the region.

This essay has defined with the use of cases to demonstrate the successful attempts to depart from the traditional approach set by the Hughes and the High Trees cases. The parameters of this doctrine seem presently not to be clearly defined. These consequences have caused the parameters of promissory estoppel to be no longer an established and well-settled area, which may interpret a huge problem to the development of contract law. The threats to the limitations of promissory estoppel, manifested from the continuing evolution of promissory estoppel, may pose turbulence in contract law and open the flood gate to litigation. Therefore, the application of the modern promissory estoppel replaces the traditionally limitations set in the landmark cases.
