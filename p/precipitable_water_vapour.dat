It has traditionally been measured using radiosondes for reasons of instrumental simplicity but these oVer limited opportunities for spatial and continuous measurements of dynamic <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> changes over large areas of the Earth’s atmosphere. EVorts have recently turned to using satellite remote sensing instruments with diVerent spectral and spatial capabilities to derive measurements of total <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> content in atmospheric columns or simply <b>precipitable</b> <b>water.</b> The merging of remote sensing data with diVerent spectral and spatial capabilities can result in large biases when independent measurements are not nested correctly to produce the ® nal product.

This research gives a better insight in the <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> in the atmosphere above Uganda. Besides weather prediction the results of this report could be used for climate studies in Africa. Together with the research of A. M.

Tropospheric humidity provides a layer-mean relative humidity for two tropospheric layers (between 600 and 850 hPa and between 850 and 600 hPa).

Through positive feedback <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> takes an important part in anthropogenically induced changes in climate resulting from increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Hence, determining its spatial and temporal vari-ability is a challenging task. The development of a complete and accurate global <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> data set is critical to an adequate understanding of the Earth’s climate system. This data is essential for studies concerning the energy and water cycle including poleward energy transports, radiation budget studies, general circulation model verification and global change research. The demands on the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> climatology are increasing in terms of {{temporal and spatial}} reso-lution. The first climatologies were based on radiosonde measurement.

Different methods based on the different spectral channels are in use. IR and VIS techniques offer measurements with a sufficient spatial resolution but they only work in the absence of significant cloud cover. Over the oceans additional informations are determined by microwave instruments. Here clouds are translucent.

40|$|AbstractSolar {{radiation}} has {{a direct}} influence {{on the air and}} ground temperature, indirect influence on the value of atmospheric humidity, movement of air masses and precipitations, and it is easy to understand how its evaluation is essential not only in the technological area such as for sizing solar heating and photovoltaic plants, but also in fields such as agriculture or meteorology. Nowadays, the assessment of the solar energy resources over large areas and the elaboration of solar radiation maps are conducted using satellite derived information. Among the existing methodologies, those based on parametric models to firstly estimate the clear-sky solar radiation are usual. The success of that option depends both on the accuracy of the solar radiation algorithm and the satellite derived information and on the relationship between each other. In this work, daily global solar irradiation under clear skies is estimated by means of a model which includes the horizon effects. This characteristic is important in those cases where a complex topography is present, such as mountains. The topographic information is obtained from a digital elevation model. The other inputs to the model are the atmospheric <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> content, the Angström's turbidity coefficient and the ground albedo. Experimental values of the atmospheric <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> content are obtained from the MODIS sensor.

We employ gaussian-shaped filters as well as actual filter transmission curves, mainly AERONET data, to study the implications imposed by the non-zero out-of-band contribution to the coefficients used to derive <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> from the measured <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> band transmittance. Published parameterized transmittance functions are applied to the data to determine the filter coefficients. We also introduce an improved, three-parameter, fitting function that can describe the theoretical data accurately, with significantly less residual effects than with the existing functions. The moderate-resolution SMARTS radiative transfer code is used to predict the incident spectrum outside the filter bandpass for different atmospheres, solar geometries and aerosol optical depths. The high-resolution LBLRTM radiative transfer code is used to calculate the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> transmittance in the 940 -nm band. The absolute level of the out-of-band transmittance has been chosen to range from 10 ? 6 to 10 ? 4, and typical response curves of commercially available silicon photodiodes are included into the calculations. It is shown that if the out-of-band transmittance effect is neglected, as is generally the case, then the derived columnar <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> is mainly underestimated by a few percents.

This {{research}} aims {{to calculate}} the transmittance to direct irradiance due to absorption by <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> vapor in the atmosphere of Thailand, estimation of the absorptance by water vapor in the atmosphere and calculate the <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> vapor in the atmosphere. The <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> vapor in the atmosphere was calculated from upper air checking data relative humidity and temperature. The data were collected at four meteorological monitoring station located in Chiang Mai, Ubon Ratchathani, Bangkok and Songkhla during the years 1991 - 2010. The figures for <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> vapor obtained from this investigation were used to formulate a mathematical model relating to the <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> from four stations with surface climatological data, relative humidity and temperature at the same stations. The result showed that the relationship has a relatively high level of reliability. The <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> vapor obtained from upper air nearly {{is equal to the}} value from the model. The difference in the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is equal to 0. 250 cm. Then, the researcher used a model {{to calculate the}} amount of <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> vapor at 85 meteorology stations nationwide. The result showed that the <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> vapor was less in the dry (November to March) and relative high in the rainy season (April-October). The average per year was found to be 4. 559 cm. When analyzing the solar radiation absorption by water vapor in the atmosphere, found that the absorption is more or less depending on the <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> vapor in the atmosphere, which has an average annual as 15. 53 percent. The transmittance to direct irradiance due to absorption average per year was found to be 84. 51 percent...|$|R

Beside their exploitation in geodynamics, the data can be used to sense the atmosphere and retrieve the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> content and variation. The surface pressure and temperature at the GPS tracking sites are necessary to compute the precipitable water; at sites where no information is available, the values can be retrieved from a global grid model. We process the data series of the permanent GPS site TNB 1 (Mario Zucchelli Station, Antarctica) from 1998 up to 2010 comparing the use of grid values to the implementation of real surface records. With both approaches, we estimate almost 70000 hourly values of <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> over 13 years and we find discrepancies varying between (1. 8 ± 0. 2) mm in summer and (3. 3 ± 0. 5) mm in winter. In addition, the discrepancies of the two solutions exhibit a clear seasonal dependency. We validate our results using radio soundings measurements. They agree better with the <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> values derived from real surface data. Nevertheless, these latter exhibit dry biases and detect the (77 ± 21) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of the split window variance ratio (SWVR) technique for estimating <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> values to AVHRR data in order to study regional and mesoscale moisture variability over land is examined. The formulation of the SWVR technique {{is based on the}} strong correlation between <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> and the split window channel transmittance ratio. The square of the transmittance ratio is estimated from the observed brightness temperature scene variations. The {{application of}} the SWVR technique to AVHRR data for the retrieval of total <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> involves calculating the split wind channel image variances and then relating the variance ratio to <b>precipitable</b> <b>water.</b> Preliminary results of the {{application of the}} SWVR technique to several passes of AVHRR imagery indicate that <b>precipitable</b> <b>water</b> values consistent with ground truth and other remote sensing measurements can be derived from AVHRR data...|$|R
