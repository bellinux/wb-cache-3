40|$|A set {{of factors}} has been {{identified}} to affect consumption of reduced-fat <b>peanut</b> butter in addition to regular <b>peanut</b> butter. We found that consumption of reduced-fat <b>peanut</b> butter, which is an imperfect substitute for regular <b>peanut</b> butter, may expand total demand for <b>peanut</b> butter. Interestingly, for those who usually buy the same brand of <b>peanut</b> butter, their consumption of reduced-fat <b>peanut</b> butter is more likely in addition to consumption of regular <b>peanut</b> butter, implying promotion of a specific brand of reduced-fat <b>peanut</b> butter tend to increase total demand for the same brand of <b>peanut</b> butter. reduced-fat <b>peanut</b> butter, regular <b>peanut</b> butter, Consumer/Household Economics,...|$|R

40|$|<b>Peanut</b> (Arachis hypogaea L.) {{is one of}} {{the major}} oilseed crops, mainly grown in {{tropical}} and sub-tropical regions of the world. It is also rich in proteins, vitamins and ions, therefore it constitutes an important portion of food nutrition for people in these regions. The production of <b>peanut</b> is being threatened by the changing environments as the major <b>peanut</b> producing counties such as China, India, and USA are facing severe water shortage for <b>peanut</b> irrigation. The yield and quality of <b>peanut</b> are negatively affected by drought and salinity. Making <b>peanut</b> more droughtand salt-tolerant will likely sustain <b>peanut</b> production in countries where water shortage or saline soil are already problems. Efforts were made to genetically engineer <b>peanut</b> for higher tolerance to drought and salt. Analysis of these transgenic <b>peanut</b> plants indicated that the agronomic traits such as <b>peanut</b> yields were the same between wild-type and transgenic <b>peanut</b> plants under normal growth conditions, yet the yields of transgenic <b>peanut</b> plants were much higher than wild-type <b>peanut</b> plant under reduced irrigation conditions. Other traits such as protein content and fatty acid compositions in the seeds of transgenic <b>peanut</b> plants were not altered under both normal and drought conditions, indicating that the genetic manipulation of <b>peanut</b> for stress tolerance did not affect chemical compositions of <b>peanut</b> seeds in transgenic <b>peanut</b> plants, only increased seed yields under stress conditions...|$|R
50|$|<b>Peanut</b> oil {{is often}} used in cooking, {{because it has a}} mild flavor and a {{relatively}} high smoke point. Due to its high monounsaturated content, it is considered healthier than saturated oils, and is resistant to rancidity. The several types of <b>peanut</b> oil include: aromatic roasted <b>peanut</b> oil, refined <b>peanut</b> oil, extra virgin or cold-pressed <b>peanut</b> oil, and <b>peanut</b> extract.

40|$|BackgroundFilaggrin (FLG) loss-of-function {{mutations}} lead to an impaired skin barrier associated with peanut allergy. Household <b>peanut</b> {{consumption is}} associated with peanut allergy, and <b>peanut</b> allergen in household dust correlates with household <b>peanut</b> consumption. ObjectiveWe {{sought to determine}} whether environmental <b>peanut</b> exposure increases the odds of <b>peanut</b> allergy and whether FLG mutations modulate these odds. MethodsExposure to <b>peanut</b> antigen in dust within {{the first year of}} life was measured in a population-based birth cohort. <b>Peanut</b> sensitization and <b>peanut</b> allergy (defined by using oral food challenges or component-resolved diagnostics [CRD]) were assessed at 8 and 11 years. Genotyping was performed for 6 FLG mutations. ResultsAfter adjustment for infantile atopic dermatitis and preceding egg skin prick test (SPT) sensitization, we found a strong and significant interaction between natural log (ln [loge]) <b>peanut</b> dust levels and FLG mutations on <b>peanut</b> sensitization and <b>peanut</b> allergy. Among children with FLG mutations, for each ln unit increase in the house dust <b>peanut</b> protein level, there was a more than 6 -fold increased odds of <b>peanut</b> SPT sensitization, CRD sensitization, or both in children at ages 8 years, 11 years, or both and a greater than  3 -fold increased odds of <b>peanut</b> allergy compared with odds seen in children with wild-type FLG. There was no significant effect of exposure in children without FLG mutations. In children carrying an FLG mutation, the threshold level for <b>peanut</b> SPT sensitization was 0. 92 μg of <b>peanut</b> protein per gram (95 % CI, 0. 70 - 1. 22 μg/g), that for CRD sensitization was 1. 03 μg/g (95 % CI, 0. 90 - 1. 82 μg/g), and that for <b>peanut</b> allergy was 1. 17 μg/g (95 % CI, 0. 01 - 163. 83 μg/g). ConclusionEarly-life environmental <b>peanut</b> exposure is associated with an increased risk of <b>peanut</b> sensitization and allergy in children who carry an FLG mutation. These data support the hypothesis that <b>peanut</b> allergy develops through transcutaneous sensitization in children with an impaired skin barrier...|$|R
