30|$|Faced {{with these}} problems, vanadium-based {{dehydrogenation}} catalysts {{are one of}} the most promising alternatives to platinum- and chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. It has been reported that types of supports, support surface area, and loading amount of vanadium-based active components are the decisive parameters for the catalytic performance of vanadium-based dehydrogenation catalysts [16]. Thus, many attentions have been paid into the selection of catalyst support. To our best knowledge, Al 2 O 3 [17], SiO 2 [17, 18], and SBA- 15 [19] have been reported as supports for vanadium-based catalysts. However, different supports lead to different catalytic behaviors on dehydrogenation reactions. Vislovskiy et al. systematically investigated V-Sb-based dehydrogenation catalysts supported on γ-Al 2 O 3, α-Al 2 O 3, SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, and MgO. By comparing their dehydrogenation conversions, they found that Al 2 O 3 has the highest conversion among these V-Sb-based dehydrogenation catalysts [17]. Thus, we can infer from the conclusion that Al 2 O 3 is very suitable as the support for vanadium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. <b>Pseudo-boehmite</b> is widely used as precursor of Al 2 O 3 because it can be conveniently converted. Therefore, in this paper, we prepared a series of vanadium-based dehydrogenation catalysts where <b>pseudo-boehmite</b> served as catalyst supports. Their structure properties and dehydrogenation behaviors were also evaluated and compared with the catalysts where commercial mesoporous Al 2 O 3 used as supports.|$|E

C 4 hydrocarbon catalytic dehydrogenation performance shows V 1 series are more selective to olefin while V 2 series are active to the dehydrogenation conversion of C 4 hydrocarbons. The reasons why {{two kinds of}} catalysts show their own strengths during the dehydrogenation reactions {{can be related to}} the dispersion of active components, the interaction between active components and their supports, the textural properties of catalysts, and reducibility.|$|E

Silica and silica-alumina samples formed branch-like gel network made of nanometer-sized clusters. During ageing at room temperature, the overall structure of the gel network remained unchanged but the clusters underwent phase transformation, coaslesence, coarsening, fragmentation, as well as dissolution resulting in the internal restructuring of the gel material. Morphological transformation associated with crystallization of <b>pseudo-boehmite</b> phase was observed for the alumina samples.

The resulting nanosized (< 10 nm) product is {{insoluble in water}} and has been characterised by solid-state NMR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction analysis, N 2 adsorption–desorption analysis and zeta potential measurements. The affinity of this new nanostructured organic–inorganic hybrid material for anionic dyes has been quantified using UV-vis spectrophotometry and by constructing the adsorption isotherms for Acid Blue 9 (AB 9), Acid Yellow 23 (AY 23), and Acid Red 37 (AR 37). Elemental/micro analyses indicate that one lysine molecule is covalently bonded to every 8 nm 2 of the functionalised material giving a composition [(AlOOH) 230 ·(H 2 O) 86 ·(C 6 N 2 O 2 H 15) ]. The introduction of the positively charged amino groups resulted in a tremendous increase in dye affinity {{in contrast to the}} unfunctionalised material. The adsorption isotherms of the functionalised <b>pseudo-boehmite</b> were fitted to the Langmuir model and yielded equilibrium binding constants (Ka) of 2. 6 × 103 M− 1 for AB 9, 1. 5 × 105 M− 1 for AY 23 and 8. 4 × 104 M− 1 for AR 37. AR 37 gave a higher monolayer coverage (Cm) value of 0. 13 mmol g− 1 than AB 9 (0. 085 mmol g− 1) and AY 23 (0. 081 mmol g− 1). Dye adsorption is correlated with surface coverage of L-lysine and, in the case of AR 37, two dye molecules are concluded to be adsorbed per L-lysine while for AY 23 a multi-point interaction is proposed to result in a lower dye capacity and a relatively higher affinity of this dye for FPB when compared with AR 37...|$|E

40|$|LiCoO 2 cathodes {{coated with}} Al 2 O 3 derived from carboxylate-alumoxanes {{have been shown}} to possess {{improved}} cyclability. The carboxylate-alumoxanes were prepared by reacting <b>pseudo-boehmite</b> with acetic and substituted acetic acids. TEM images of the coated powders revealed that the alumina formed a compact kernel of thickness averaging about 20 nm. XRD data on the coated materials suggested the formation of solid solutions of the composition LiAlyCo 1 −yO 2 on the surface, a conclusion attested by ESCA depth profiles. Galvanostatic cycling studies suggested that a coating formed from (methoxyethoxy) acetate-alumoxane enhanced the cyclability 13 -fold. The improved cyclability is attributed to suppression of the cycle-limiting phase transitions accompanying the charge–discharge processes.

30|$|The pore {{structure}} of catalyst {{is important for}} reactions. For FCC catalysts, three types of pores are involved according to the classification criterion by IUPAC. Micropores with pore diameter less than 2  nm, which are provided by the active component such as Y zeolite, act as the main repository for hydrocarbon cracking. However, heavy oil molecules are too large {{to enter into the}} micropores for their diameters are in the range of 3 – 10  nm. It turns out that the diffusion of molecules in porous channels is not limited when the optimized pore sizes are 2 – 6 times bigger than the diameter of molecules. Therefore, the macropores (> 50  nm) inside new matrix contribute more effectively to the pre-cracking of heavy oil macromolecules compared to <b>pseudo-boehmite</b> binder (Fig.  4 b). In contrast, the mesopores (2 – 50  nm), which are composed of secondary pores of zeolites and amorphous matrix, can be used for the cracking cycloparaffins and side-chain aromatics into light cycle oil (LCO). Besides, the acidity on mesopores should be mild and its numbers are usually limited.|$|E

To better understand the effect of surface properties on the adsorption behavior of phosphate, the surface structure and properties were investigated with X-ray diffraction, N- 2 adsorption-desorption, electron microscope observation and surface acid-base titrations. The results from adsorption isotherms showed that at both pH 4 and 6, pseudo-gamma-AIOOH exhibited greater adsorption capacity than alpha-Al 2 O 3. For both pseudo-gamma-AlOOH and alpha-AL(2) O(3), the adsorbed amount of phosphate at pH 4 was higher than that at pH 6. Adsorption density calculation indicated that alpha-Al 2 O 3 had greater affinity for phosphate than pseudo-gamma-AlOOH.
