Considering the product {{as central to}} the automation rationale provides each product occurrence with informational and decisional capabilities. This paper considers a formal framework for such product-driven automation {{within the context of}} the Supervisory Control Theory. Two interoperable classes of <b>supervisors</b> are synthesized. <b>Product</b> <b>supervisors</b> control routings through the manufacturing system according to customised product specifications and resource capabilities, and resource supervisors manage the execution of operations required by <b>product</b> <b>supervisors.</b> A case study, based on a flexible assembly cell, illustrates the approach and opens issues for industrial practice...|$|R

50|$|Boswell based the {{character}} of Reid Fleming on a childhood bully with the same name. Reid employs extremely aggressive means in delivering his dairy <b>products.</b> His <b>supervisor</b> is Mr.Crabbe, whose head is unusual in shape, and who has little, if any, patience with Reid Fleming. If {{it was up to}} him, Reid would have been fired years ago, but Reid's employer, Mr. O'Clock, prefers to just dock Reid's pay for all the milk trucks he wrecked in his recklessness (8 {{at the start of the}} story); O'Clock's reticence to fire Reid may be due to the fact that he is Reid's biological father, as implied in issue #5 (#6 under the Deep Sea Comics imprint); at the end of the issue, a scene set in the future shows that Reid is now president of the company.|$|R
40|$|Fishermen, who {{initially}} harvest the resource, usually content themselves with landing and selling the raw material. It is the food processing industry, wholesalers, distributors and retailers that create added value from the fish by transforming it or/and differentiating different types or quality grades. Focussing upon Brittany, Normandy and the Channel coasts of Northern France, we observed that actors {{of the channel}} of market could also play their part in adding value to seafood products. A pilot study was made among 18 fishermen, 18 wholesale firms, 11 seafood <b>products</b> department <b>supervisors</b> in supermarkets and hypermarkets and 37 fishmongers {{at the beginning of}} 1999. These 84 market studies focussed on the seven methods used to add value: modification of fishing techniques; introduction of quality improvements; differentiation between fish, shellfish and crustaceans; policies of certification or collective brands; economic integration in the sector; creation of value added products; information and promotion to consumers. After recalling the various reasons for adding value to seafood products, the results of our market study of 84 professionals are presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This thesis first {{examines}} {{existing research}} on product management and performance appraisal systems, presenting methods of aligning {{the two systems}} so they work congruently toward improving overall organizational performance. Following is an examination of these systems as they currently exist in the Canadian pharmaceutical industry. The analysis of these two systems as they appear in this highly volatile marketplace lead the author to speculate {{that they may not}} be sufficiently aligned, and therefore may not be working congruently toward attaining the goals of the organization. A number of issues are presented that lead the author to question the effectiveness of existing performance appraisal systems. One such issue is significant ambiguity between <b>product</b> manager and <b>supervisor</b> perceptions of the functions and objectives used to evaluate the product manager's performance. Ultimately, this ambiguity may indicate that product managers are not performing the tasks that their supervisors and their organizations believe they should be performing to be successful in their roles...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{assesses the}} degree of banking {{competition}} and efficiency in Italy?over {{time as well as}} compared to that in other countries, such as France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The paper finds competition in the Italian banking sector has intensified in loan and deposit markets in recent years, but banks still operate in a highcost, high-income system, particularly with respect to retail/services, and efficiency gains have yet to fully materialize. The degree of competition falls within the range of estimates for a set of comparator countries. Greater contestability should act as a powerful force to drive banks to become more competitive and efficient. Competition policy will also continue to be an important consideration, both in enforcing Italy''s antitrust laws and in ensuring that the procedures for dealing with weak banks and other merger and acquisition reviews focus on stability and competition objectives.

50|$|By 1967, Mackinac College (1966-1970) at Mission Point needed conference rooms, science labs, {{and more}} classrooms. This {{led to the}} {{construction}} of the Clark Center for the Arts and Sciences (81,057 ft2), which was also designed by Edwin B. Cromwell. It was paid for by donations from Mr. and Mrs. Van Alan Clark (hon. Chairman of Avon <b>Products,</b> Inc.). Construction <b>supervisors</b> reported that the Clark Center and the Peter Howard Library were built by more than 325 volunteer workers from 13 different countries. Room, board, and travel expenses for these workers were covered by the college. Included were 115 Native Americans from tribal groups across the United States and Canada. Twenty-four volunteers came from South Korea, 16 from Japan, 9 from Denmark, 8 from Jamaica, 7 from Indonesia, 2 from Finland and 1 each from Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and Trinidad and Tobago. Some were skilled tradesmen who trained others in the skills of their trades. Many reported that living and working with others from such diverse backgrounds developed their respect for cultural, racial and national differences. Some eventually became students at the college.|$|R
40|$|During {{the spring}} {{semester}} of 2012 did Petra Hollsten independently a thesis on reducing {{the environmental impact of}} capsule for coffee, tea and chocolate. The work was performed at Karlstad University, Faculty of Technology and Science under the Bachelor of Science program in innovation, technology and design. The project's scope is at 22. 5 points. The employment for this project is the company Löfbergs Lila AB in Karlstad. Supervisor at the Principal has been Maria Herou Wallner and Sandra Lyxell, <b>product</b> managers. <b>Supervisor</b> at Karlstad University is Monica Jakobsson, lecturer and program leader for innovation and design engineering program. Examiner is Fredrik Thuvander, lecturer and professor at Karlstad University. The company Löfbergs Lila is a family business and one of the leading suppliers of coffee in Sweden that invests in quality from plantation to consumer and environmental responsibility. Sales of capsules and capsule machines are increasing very rapidly and have become very popular. The company's move to the bridge method with capsule machines must be good for the environment as possible. Which gave rise to this project to help reduce the environmental impact of the capsules? The largest part of the project was to conduct a thorough research to determine important characteristics about coffee, how the market looks for the capsules, how the capsule and the capsule machine works, the climate impact of packaging and coffee, how to evaluate environmental impact and a materials study. That is partly conducted through field visits, literature searches, and retrieval of information by providers. The result of the project was to reduce environmental impact by replacing the capsule existing materials to alternative renewable materials. To evaluate the alternative materials used tool ECO Audit Tool contained in material selection program CES EduPack 2011. Through the tool, you can read energy consumption and carbon emissions. It resulted in which material that had the lowest environmental impact. Along with the choice of material was sketched a proposal for a new design on the sleeve capsule which would lead to moving a function from capsule to capsule sleeve. This would reduce one part of the capsule and has less environmental impact and facilitate recycling for consumers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{new approach}} to the supervisory control of complex systems modelled as Multi-Agent (MA) products of finite deterministic automata. First, the centralized supervisory control problem for the MA product is considered. This differs from the standard approach to supervisory control since (i) vector languages are under consideration and (ii) each supervisor can disable only one particular component of a vector event. The notion of MA controllability is introduced and is shown to essentially constitute a necessary and sufficient condition for the synthesis of an MA supervisor. In the case when a given vector language K fails to be MA controllable, an algorithm for finding the infimal MA controllable superlanguage of K is presented. It is also shown that there exists, {{with respect to the}} inclusion partial order, a maximal MA controllable sublanguage of K. The results constitute a natural extension of the central classical supervisory control results for scalar systems to the more general MA product system case. Second, the controllability properties of component structures are investigated. It is proved that the property of MA controllability is preserved under iterative MA product construction. Moreover, it is proved that in this case the MA <b>product</b> of <b>supervisors</b> of subsystems ensures the desired behaviour of the MA product of specifications for the iterative MA product. Several examples illustrate that neither standard controllability nor the second property of MA controllability, so-called MAC 2, are preserved under projection operation. However, a sufficient condition for the standard controllability of a component in terms of the original vector specification and the MA product is given. The equality of the vector specification projected on the set of some components of an original MA product and an MA product of the projections on the corresponding components is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the projected specification having MAC 2 property. Furthermore, a special class of specifications, namely, state trajectory specifications, for both scalar and vector automata is considered and conditions for the embedding of two specifications are presented. Third, the notion of the Graph-Relation MA product is introduced. Through this construction, we modify the connection of supervisors and vector system under consideration, and prove that the property of MA controllably remains the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a solution to the supervisory control problem. Next, an initial investigation on the MA product under partial observation is presented. The notions of MA observability and MA co-observability are formulated and it is shown that they {{play a key role in}} the solution of decentralized supervisory control problems for the MA product. Furthermore, applications to hybrid systems are explored. Finally, a line of further research on centralized and decentralized MA product is mapped out, as well as complexity studies and the generation of MA software...|$|R
