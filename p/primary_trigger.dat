25|$|The primary urge {{to breathe}} is {{triggered}} by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) {{levels in the}} bloodstream. Carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream when oxygen is metabolized {{and it needs to}} be expelled as a waste product. The body detects carbon dioxide levels very accurately and relies on this as the <b>primary</b> <b>trigger</b> to control breathing. Hyperventilation artificially depletes the resting concentration of carbon dioxide causing a low blood carbon dioxide condition called hypocapnia. Hypocapnia reduces the reflexive respiratory drive, allows the delay of breathing and leaves the diver susceptible to loss of consciousness from hypoxia. For most healthy people the first sign of low oxygen levels is a greyout or unconsciousness: there is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout.|$|E

5000|$|Valve Software's Half-Life 2 made {{significant}} use of physics in the game, {{powered by the}} Source engine. The physics engine within Source is derived from Havok, which opens up a wealth of possibilities for object interaction - particularly when later in the game, Freeman receives an energy-beam weapon that lets him move huge objects. Although the player can pick up and throw objects early in the game, this ability is somewhat limited in scope. Around {{a quarter of the}} way through the game, the player acquires the gravity gun, properly named as the [...] "zero-point energy field manipulator". Alyx Vance explains that the gravity gun is designed for handling hazardous materials, but is mostly used for heavy lifting. She explains to Gordon that she once found it useful [...] "for clearing minefields". The gravity gun significantly increases the player's ability to manipulate objects in the game. Like most other weapons in the game, the gravity gun has two trigger functions. The <b>primary</b> <b>trigger</b> causes the gun to emit a small discharge which emits energy to the targeted object. The distance which the object is forced is dependent on its weight and distance from the gun. The secondary trigger attracts the targeted object to the gun and holds it in midair a few inches away, negating its weight and allowing the player to carry it with them. Using the secondary trigger again will drop the item, while the <b>primary</b> <b>trigger</b> will launch it with considerable force.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: TLR are <b>primary</b> <b>triggers</b> of {{the innate}} im-mune system by {{recognizing}} various microorganisms through conserved pathogen-associated molecular pat-terns. TLR 2 is the receptor for a functional recognition of bacterial lipopeptides (LP) and is up-regulated during various {{disorders such as}} chronic obstructive pul-monary disease and sepsis. This receptor is unique {{in its ability to}} form heteromers with TLR 1 or TLR 6 to me-diate intracellular signaling. According to the fatty acid pattern as well as the assembling of the polypeptide tail, LP can signal through TLR 2 in a TLR 1 - or TLR 6 -dependent manner. There are also di- and triacylated LP, which stimulate TLR 1 -deficient cells and TLR 6 -deficient cells. In this study, we investigated whether heterodimerization evolutionarily devel...|$|R

The common denominators for the activation of inflammatory genes appear to be a small subset of transcription factors-among which include nuclear factor-&# 954;B, activator protein- 1 (AP- 1), and GATA-that function as the central hub of vascular inflammation. Strategies directed to inhibit both the secondary mediators and the <b>primary</b> <b>triggers</b> (atherosclerosis risk factors) appear viable to inhibit atherosclerosis.

25|$|Human {{activities}} can trigger trophic cascades (Jefferies 1997), which {{occur when the}} predators that limit abundance of prey and thereby enhance survival of the next lower trophic level are depleted (Strong 1992).

50|$|The guns have a <b>primary</b> <b>trigger</b> {{which can}} be pressed once for a single shot or held for {{continuous}} fire, with an unlimited number of shots. A second trigger called the high power button {{is located on the}} left hand side of the gun and when pressed gives a quick tone indicating that a high powered shot is ready. If, within a few seconds, the main trigger is then pressed, a high power shot would be fired. This high power shot would take off three hit points from a headset, whereas a normal shot would take off one. When turned on, each headset would start at nine hit points and when shot would count down and display the remaining hit points. When they reached zero, the headset sounds a death tone and the player is tagged out. There exists a way to perform target practice with a headset and gun. The user would activate the headset, and during the power-on process, would shoot at the headset from the gun. The headset would go dark and silent for a random period of time before beeping and lighting up, indicating a target to shoot. After a short interval, if the user didn't shoot it, it would go dark.

5000|$|Cytochrome c {{is widely}} {{believed}} to be localized solely in the mitochondrial intermembrane space under normal physiological conditions. The release of cytochrome-c from mitochondria to the cytosol, where it activates the caspase family of proteases {{is believed to be}} <b>primary</b> <b>trigger</b> leading to the onset of apoptosis. Measuring the amount of cytochrome c leaking from mitochondria to cytosol, and out of the cell to culture medium, is a sensitive method to monitor the degree of apoptosis. [...] However, detailed immunoelectron microscopic studies with rat tissues sections employing cytochrome c-specific antibodies provide compelling evidence that cytochrome-c under normal cellular conditions is also present at extramitochondrial locations. In pancreatic acinar cells and the anterior pituitary, strong and specific presence of cytochrome-c was detected in zymogen granules and in growth hormone granules respectively. In the pancreas, cytochrome-c was also found in condensing vacuoles and in the acinar lumen. The extramitochondrial localization of cytochrome c was shown to be specific as it was completely abolished upon adsorption of the primary antibody with the purified cytochrome c. The presence of cytochrome-c outside of mitochondria at specific location under normal physiological conditions raises important questions concerning its cellular function and translocation mechanism. Besides cytochrome c, extramitochondrial localization has also been observed for large numbers of other proteins including those encoded by mitochondrial DNA. This raises the possibility about existence of yet-unidentified specific mechanisms for protein translocation from mitochondria to other cellular destinations.|$|E

Two major lines of evidence emerge.

Second, both costimulatory CSSMs that promote the response, and coinhibitory CSSMs that inhibit the response, are required to control direction and magnitude of a given immune response. With such tight feedback, immune responses are tuned and returned to baseline. These findings extend well beyond our previous observation in the requirement for lymphocyte activation and argue a revisit of the traditional “two-signal model” for activation and tolerance of lymphocytes.

In both yeast and mammalian neuron-like cells, overexpression of Npl 4 and Ufd 1 ameliorates polyQ toxicity.
