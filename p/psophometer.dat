5000|$|Psophometric voltage is {{a circuit}} noise voltage {{measured}} with a <b>psophometer</b> that includes a CCIF-1951 weighting network.|$|E
5000|$|In telecommunications, a <b>psophometer</b> is an {{instrument}} that provides a visual indication of the audible effects of disturbing voltages of various frequencies.|$|E
50|$|A <b>psophometer</b> usually {{incorporates}} a weighting network. The {{characteristics of the}} weighting network depend {{on the type of}} circuit under investigation, such as whether the circuit is used for high-fidelity music or for normal speech.|$|E
40|$|Introduction This {{specification}} provides {{basic requirements}} for psophometers {{to be used}} for the measurement of noise and other interfering signals on international telephone circuits and circuit sections. 2 General To accomplish the measurements as stated above, a <b>psophometer</b> should have the following significant characteristics: a) The relative sensitivity of the instrument, at various frequencies, should be as specified by the psophometric weighting characteristics. b) The reference point for the sensitivity of the instrument should be 0 dBm (one milliwatt) at 800 Hz. c) The r. m. s. (root mean square) value of the weighted noise signal should be detected and displayed. d) The dynamics of the detector and display device should meet requirements given in 3. e) The overall accuracy of the instrument when being used in its normal range and environmental conditions should be Â± |. 0 dB or better. Specific tests for accuracy of various aspects of th...|$|E
