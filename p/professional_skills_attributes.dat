40|$|Background - Expansion of the pharmacists' {{role within}} the United Kingdom {{has raised the}} {{question}} as to whether pharmacy graduates are equipped with the <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>attributes</b> they will need to fulfil such roles. Aim - To describe the <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>attributes</b> pre-registration recruiters perceive pharmacy graduates should exhibit and to establish whether final year students perceive they possess these <b>skills</b> and <b>attributes.</b> Method - Five individuals were interviewed from a variety of pre-registration employers; 90 final year students completed a questionnaire (response 69. 2 %). Results - The recruiters thought that whilst graduates possess sufficient knowledge, they show weaknesses such as inability to apply theoretical knowledge into practice and the lack of good communication and interpersonal skills. Conversely, a majority of students felt that they did possess the necessary skills to enter pre-registration training. Conclusion - Schools of pharmacy need to ensure that students have an opportunity to develop key <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> to assist students in securing pre-registration positions. © 2010 FIP...|$|R

40|$|The IS {{professional}} is {{a person}} endowed with certain <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>attributes</b> usually formally obtained through an education process. The IS professional may also have formal skills in peripheral, non technical areas that may too be obtained through a formal education process. This is typical now {{in the education of}} IS students who are aspiring IS professional. In addition they come with a range of soft skills that may be attitudinal and influenced by life and work experiences. This paper suggests that these <b>skills,</b> <b>attributes</b> and work environment do not sit in isolation from each other, but interact in an as yet unmeasured way. How this happens with students studying towards an IS qualification is discussed here and a structural model is developed to explain the interactions. The value of this research is that a picture is presented that shows the interactions between these important elements in a quantitative way...|$|R

40|$|For {{some years}} {{there has been}} much debate between various {{stakeholders}} about the need for accounting graduates to develop a broader set of skills to be able to pursue a career in the accounting profession. This study uses mixed methods to examine perceptions and expectations of two major stakeholders: students and employers. Findings indicate that students are becoming aware of employers' expectations in terms of communication, analytical, <b>professional</b> and teamwork <b>skills.</b> Although employers are still expecting a good understanding of basic accounting skills and strong analytical skills, they are also requiring 'business awareness' and knowledge in terms of the 'real world'. Both students and employers report that many of the 'essential' non-technical and <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>attributes</b> are not being developed sufficiently in university accounting programmes.

40|$|In Australia, {{as in many}} {{overseas}} countries, {{construction management}} and nursing programs include a requisite number of clinical placements or periods of industrial experience. This chapter reviews the structures, approaches, assessment and evaluation strategies adopted by nursing and construction management for work integrated learning (WIL) placements. The organisation of WIL presents universities {{with a number of}} logistical challenges. These include the difficulties inherent in sourcing suitable placement opportunities for large numbers of students {{while at the same time}} taking into account the competing demands of students’ paid work commitments. Following a discussion of these issues, this chapter maps the competencies in the two disciplines to illustrate the alignment of <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>attributes</b> demonstrated during placement experiences. The aim of this exercise is to show how the attributes can be aligned and documented to enable students to link the theoretical concepts learned at university with real-world practices. This discussion provides a foundation for the next chapter, which addresses how these competencies can be a source of reflection for students and, further, embedded into an on-line system for documentation and assessment purposes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a strategy for}} conducting a whole-of-program review of the teaching of generic skills in a university Accounting program. Importantly, the strategy also builds the longer-term capacity of accounting staff to maintain the relevance and coherence of their program. In a systematic process, Accounting staff first map the courses they teach, ensuring alignment between generic skills and objectives, and objectives and teaching and assessment activities. On {{the basis of the}} individual course maps, an Accounting program map is then developed. The information contained in the program map is subsequently analysed to provide data about the depth to which generic skills are being taught. This analysis underpins a review of the teaching of generic skills by all academic staff teaching on the Accounting program and, as discussed, can lead to changes in objectives, teaching activities and teaching methods. The strategy thus builds in academic staff an awareness of and the capacity to apply effective course design principles {{while at the same time}} improving generic skill learning outcomes for students.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the politics of}} employability for students undertaking taught tourism Masters programmes funded by the European Social Fund. Students at the University of Sunderland were surveyed as to their projected aspirations for employment, {{the extent to which}} they felt that their programme had enhanced their employability in both the public and private sectors, and asked to reflect upon their own employability <b>skills</b> and <b>attributes.</b> Findings indicate that firstly, postgraduate tourism students are fairly confident that they have the necessary <b>professional</b> employability <b>skills</b> and <b>attributes</b> for higher level employment. Secondly, the vast majority of students recognise that careers guidance is the responsibility of both themselves and the MSc programme team. Thirdly, in terms of employment itself our key finding is that students want academic employment on the whole. We argue that this may in fact reflect a lack of higher level employment opportunities in the tourism employability market. Finally, we place these findings within the European context...|$|R
40|$|In {{engineering}} education, {{the accreditation}} {{and assessment of}} academic programmes is vital {{in order to maintain}} the quality and the status of engineering graduates, and hence the technical workforce. Results of a survey of the relevant literature and observations indicate that various accreditation models have been developed regionally, as well as internationally but most of these models seem to be non-uniform, too complex, non-transparent and, moreover, non-precise. This leads to confusion and growing concerns about the mutual recognition and global mobility of the engineering profession. As a result, there is an urgent need for a systematic global model of engineering accreditation that can be used to assess global <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>attributes</b> of engineering graduates. The aim of the current paper is to present a brief review of existing accreditation systems implemented in engineering education worldwide as well as to describe the methodology for developing a global accreditation model in engineering education. Various existing accreditation models in engineering education are briefly discussed in this paper and the strengths and weaknesses of these models are outlined and presented. The need for the global accreditation model has been justified and the methodology for the development of the model is outlined with its advantages listed in the paper...|$|R

40|$|The School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Queen’s University Belfast {{introduced}} a new degree programme in Product Design and Development (PDD) in 2004. As well as setting out to meet all UK-SPEC requirements, the entirely new curriculum was developed {{in line with the}} syllabus and standards defined by the CDIO initiative, an international collaboration of universities aiming to improve the education of engineering students. The CDIO ethos is that students are taught within the context of conceiving, designing, implementing and operating a product or system. Fundamental to this is an integrated curriculum with multiple design-build-test (DBT) experiences at the core. Unlike most traditional engineering courses, the PDD degree features group DBT projects in all years of the programme. The projects increase in complexity and challenge in a staged manner, with learning outcomes guided by Bloom’s taxonomy of learning domains. The integrated course structure enables the immediate application of disciplinary knowledge gained from other modules, as well as development of <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>attributes</b> {{in the context of the}} DBT activity. This has a positive impact on student engagement, and the embedding of these relevant skills, identified from a stakeholder survey, has also been shown to better prepare students for professional practice. This paper will detail the methodology used in the development of the curriculum, the refinements that have been made during the first five years of operation, and will discuss the resource and staffing issues raised in facilitating such a learning environment...|$|R
40|$|Work-integrated {{learning}} (WIL) {{is regarded}} as an important vehicle to assist students’ development of relevant <b>professional</b> <b>skills,</b> knowledge and <b>attributes</b> that can enhance their employability. WIL arrangement for international students is a challenging issue for institutions, international students themselves {{as well as other}} related stakeholders. While there is an emerging body of literature that examines WIL for international students, how the value of WIL is perceived by this cohort is little known. This paper responds to this dearth of the literature by exploring the different meanings that international students in the vocational education and training sector attach to WIL. Using Bourdieu’s thinking tools of capitals and habitus to interpret interview data from 105 international students, this paper shows that WIL is seen to not only add value to student learning, career aspiration and employability but also transform and enhance their symbolic and social capitals. The paper underscores the instrumental, symbolic and developmental meanings that international students associate with WIL. In particular, it highlights the reciprocal relationship between students’ development of vocational ‘being’ and personal ‘being’ through WIL...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{examines the}} notion of Teacher standards using a value-theory approach. It questions the widely held assumption that Teacher standards are Universal and argues for scholarly debate on the conceptualization of who a Pacific teacher ought to be and what standard descriptors {{may be used to}} measure professionalism in the region. The discussion includes an examination of the Proposed Regional Standards for Teachers and Principals in the Pacific. It presents an analysis of the teacher standards survey circulated to fifteen Pacific island countries in 2008. Reflective analysis indicates that there is a critical need for an in-depth survey to be purposefully administered in the islands, ensuring research rigor, validity and reliability of data collated. It is also significant that knowledge appears to rank higher on the priority scale than does <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>attributes.</b> If these views represent widely held beliefs about Teachers in the region, their implementation could mean a shift in Teacher Education and Training to the ‘old-school’ approach of technical teachers. This technocratic approach is juxtaposed against the evolving notion of the teacher as professional curriculum practitioners in their own right driven by an educational worldview that is premised on a foundation of beliefs, values and attitudes that expand into contextual teaching practice. A technocratic approach to Teacher education could ultimately herald in an era of technical experts with little if any value for ‘quality education’ and of ‘learning to be’ future Pacific Island citizens capable of critical and creative problem solving and with the potential to contribute to wider development discourse to bring about critical mass and conscientization. ...|$|R

Professional development and reflective practice strengthens our industry, our professional communities and the growth of <b>professional</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>attributes</b> for individual practitioners. ALIA Sydney has a challenging brief encompassing the diverse spectrum of libraries across Sydney but seeks to create and support a vibrant community of reflective practice and a culture of active {{professional development}} that embraces this diversity. In 2011 the committee tackled this goal by presenting a variety of formal and informal events that encouraged discussion, critical engagement and networking opportunities. The events focussed on a range of topics relevant to the changing library and information industry and experimented with alternative presentation methods. These experimental events combined with effective committee recruitment and succession planning has created a vibrant and sustainable group of volunteers around which a community of practice is developing. This paper seeks to explore the experiences of the ALIA Sydney committee in juxtaposition with existing literature to identify successful strategies for building strong professional development communities. A literature review will be performed to examine existing approaches to professional development cultures and models of communities of practice whilst the impact of ALIA Sydney’s activities will be investigated through surveys of committee and community members on the contribution of ALIA Sydney to their professional development throughout 2011. The paper will then explore the wider implications of the ALIA Sydney experience for professional development in the library and information industry and identify strategies for developing a culture of professional development within individual organisations...|$|R
