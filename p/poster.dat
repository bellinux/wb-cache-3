5|$|A 2013 book {{researched}} by James Taylor counters {{the popular}} {{belief that the}} Leete design was an influential recruitment tool during the war. He claims the original artwork was acquired by the Imperial War Museum in 1917 and catalogued as a <b>poster</b> in error. Though the image of Kitchener (Britain's most popular soldier) inspired several other <b>poster</b> designs, Taylor says he can find no evidence in photographs {{of the time that}} the Leete <b>poster</b> was used, although a photograph from 15 December 1914 taken at the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway station in Liverpool clearly depicts Leete's depiction among other recruiting posters.|$|E
5|$|About a {{month before}} the race took place, in February 2015, the race organisers {{published}} a publicity <b>poster</b> for the race. This <b>poster</b> showed a woman, with her dress raised and underwear with the race logo visible. A cyclist's gloved hand was reaching out apparently to pinch the woman's bottom. The <b>poster</b> bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"). This was a reference to Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he pinched the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after the race.|$|E

50|$|Many <b>posters,</b> {{particularly}} early <b>posters,</b> {{were used}} for advertising products. <b>Posters</b> continue {{to be used for}} this purpose, with <b>posters</b> advertising films, music (both concerts and recorded albums), comic books, and travel destinations being particularly notable examples.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the result of {{research}} of the collection of concert <b>posters</b> from the NMHM collections. It was found that the <b>posters</b> refer to the period of time from 1900 to 2010 and represent a brief chronicle of the musical life of Moldova east of the Prut River. Chronologically and by the method of production, form and content they can be classified into four categories: 1) concert <b>posters</b> of the times of Imperial Russia, 2) concert <b>posters</b> of the times of Romanian government, 3) concert <b>posters</b> of the Soviet period, and 4) concert <b>posters</b> of the Republic Moldova. The <b>posters</b> of the first two categories contain much text, partly black and white images, are of small size (A 4 sheet), printed on paper of poor quality, mainly newsprint. <b>Posters</b> of the Soviet period are of two types: <b>posters</b> with lots of text without images and color <b>posters,</b> of various sizes. Concert <b>posters</b> of the Republic of Moldova have diverse formats and images, but provide little information. It was also found that the concert <b>posters</b> of the times of Tsarist Russia and the Romanian government are very few, and <b>posters</b> of singers and musical groups, as well as folk singers and orchestras of 1960 s are completely missing...|$|R
5|$|In December 2001, Sony gave fans {{a chance}} to design the film's <b>poster</b> with a prize of an {{undisclosed}} amount of cash, a free screening of the film, and with the final design being the film's <b>poster.</b> On February 16, 2002, Nick Des Barres, a 23-year-old aspiring actor and ex-video game magazine designer, was announced as {{the winner of the}} competition. The film's trailer and clips were released in late January and early February 2002.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, the Berlin Administrative Court {{ruled that}} a <b>poster</b> placed by local city {{authorities}} on an advertising column next to a bus {{stop in front of}} the Berlin Scientology headquarters, warning passers-by of the potential dangers Scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom, should be removed. The decision was upheld in July 2009 by the Upper Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg which ruled that the <b>poster</b> violated Scientologists' basic religious rights.|$|E

50|$|Many {{printing}} techniques {{are used to}} produce <b>posters.</b> While most <b>posters</b> are mass-produced, <b>posters</b> may also be printed by hand or in limited editions. Most <b>posters</b> are printed {{on one side and}} left blank on the back, the better for affixing to a wall or other surface. Pin-up sized <b>posters</b> are usually printed on A3 Standard Silk paper in full colour. Upon purchase, most commercially available <b>posters</b> are often rolled up into a cylindrical tube to allow for damage-free transportation. Rolled-up <b>posters</b> can then be flattened under pressure for several hours to regain their original form.|$|R

5|$|Oasis {{evolved from}} an earlier band called the Rain, {{composed}} of Paul McGuigan (bass guitar), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Tony McCarroll (drums) and Chris Hutton (vocals). Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance Liam Gallagher as a replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis. This change was inspired by an Inspiral Carpets tour <b>poster</b> that hung in the Gallagher brothers' bedroom. One of the venues the <b>poster</b> listed was the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon.|$|E

The {{need to explore}} creative forms of awareness information dissemination remains necessary. <b>Posters</b> continue to present a cheap alternative to expensive mass media campaigns. However, the effectiveness of <b>posters</b> in disseminating HIV/AIDS awareness information is difficult to ascertain. Designers of <b>posters</b> aim for visual appeal, with the intention that the <b>posters</b> {{attract the attention of}} target audience. Studies on how often <b>posters</b> are being noticed at universities, has not been undertaken.

In addition, Rocketeers {{original}} Art Deco <b>poster</b> was changed because it failed {{to draw attention to}} the cast, including then-current James Bond, Timothy Dalton. A new <b>poster</b> was designed to feature Dalton, Billy Campbell and Jennifer Connelly prominently. The film also failed in Britain, grossing just over £1 million in its first two weeks at just under 250 screens.

40|$|This article aims {{to analyze}} a corpus formed by sample of <b>posters</b> {{used in the}} Brazilian protests, called "Passe Livre”, in 2013. Our study intents {{understand}} the <b>posters</b> under the multi-systemic perspective (Castilho, 2010). The <b>posters</b> {{are a kind of}} textual genre (Bakhtin, 2011). This work explores the mutual interactions between the language and the social facts, performing quantitative analysis of the <b>posters</b> at various levels (from the lexical to the pragmatic-discursive level). Our methodological pillars are the concepts of habitus and linguistic market (Bourdieu, 2003) and the concept of “liquid modernity” (Bauman, 2001). Our analysis showed that: 1) the most common theme of the <b>posters</b> refer to the act of protest, 2) only 40 % of the <b>posters</b> are argumentative or injunctive texts, 3) the <b>posters</b> have, in general, only once sentence, 4) in low frequency, the <b>posters</b> have elements of the non-verbal languages, 5) the <b>posters</b> have, more often, simple phrases period, 6) imperative verbs are rare on those <b>posters,</b> and, finally, 7) most of the <b>posters</b> are for declaring something and do another reflect, but not to demand something. All these features indicate that <b>posters</b> have a relationship with the texts of social networks, to which are connected in real time, and are a linguistic product of the generation that has in your habitus the rules of the "liquid modernity"...|$|R

5|$|The promotional cinema <b>poster</b> for {{the film}} {{featured}} a woman holding a crossbow; she was photographed from behind, and her outfit left {{the bottom half of}} her buttocks exposed. The effect was achieved by having the model wear a pair of bikini bottoms backwards, so that the part seen on her backside is actually the front of the suit. The <b>poster</b> caused some furore—largely in the US—with The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times considering the <b>poster</b> so unsuitable they edited out everything above the knee, whilst the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair of shorts over the legs. There was significant speculation as to the identity of the model before photographer Morgan Kane identified her as Joyce Bartle.|$|E
