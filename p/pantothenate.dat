5|$|The 'core' neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, {{in which}} acanthocytes are a typical feature, are chorea acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome. Acanthocytes are seen less {{frequently}} in other conditions including Huntington's disease-like syndrome 2 (HDL2) and <b>pantothenate</b> kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN).|$|E
5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and {{a family history of}} the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and <b>pantothenate</b> kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E

25|$|Pantothenic acid, {{also called}} vitamin B5 (a B vitamin), is a {{water-soluble}} vitamin. Pantothenic acid {{is an essential}} nutrient. Animals require pantothenic acid to synthesize coenzyme-A (CoA), {{as well as to}} synthesize and metabolize proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. The anion is called <b>pantothenate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Concerning organic requirements, most {{strains of}} S. cerevisiae require biotin. Indeed, a S. cerevisiae-based growth assay laid the {{foundation}} for the isolation, crystallisation, and later structural determination of biotin. Most strains also require <b>pantothenate</b> for full growth. In general, S. cerevisiae is prototrophic for vitamins.|$|E
25|$|As {{its primary}} {{ingredient}} is rye, kvass {{is a good}} source of vitamin B-1 and B-6, magnesium, phosphorus, amino acids, and <b>pantothenate.</b> It is also rich in lactic acid and simple sugars, which contributes to its pleasant, thirst-quenching taste, provides ample calories to fuel physical activity, and may improve digestion, as with other lacto-fermented foods such as yogurt and sauerkraut.|$|E
25|$|Addition {{of extra}} {{nitrogen}} generally decreases cellulose production while addition of precursor molecules such as amino acids and methionine improved yield. Pyridoxine, nicotinic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid and biotin are vitamins important for cellulose production whereas <b>pantothenate</b> and riboflavin have opposing effects. In reactors where {{the process is}} more complex, water-soluble polysaccharides such as agar, acetan, and sodium alginate are added to prevent clumping or coagulation of bacterial cellulose.|$|E
25|$|Honey bees obtain all {{of their}} {{nutritional}} requirements from a diverse combination of pollen and nectar. Pollen is the only natural protein source for honey bees. Adult worker honey bees consume 3.4-4.3mg of pollen per day to meet a dry matter requirement of 66-74% protein. The rearing of one larva requires 125-187.5mg pollen or 25-37.5mg protein for proper development. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, ten of which are considered essential to honey bees: methionine, tryptophan, arginine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, leucine, and valine. Of these amino acids, honey bees require highest concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, however elevated concentrations of arginine and lysine are required for brood rearing. In addition to these amino acids, some B vitamins including biotin, folic acid, nicotinamide, riboflavin, thiamine, <b>pantothenate,</b> and most importantly, pyridoxine are required to rear larvae. Pyridoxine is the most prevalent B vitamin found in royal jelly and concentrations vary throughout the foraging season with lowest concentrations found in May and highest concentrations found in July and August. Honey bees lacking dietary pyridoxine were unable to rear brood.|$|E
2500|$|The {{derivative}} of pantothenic acid, pantothenol (panthenol), {{is a more}} stable form of the vitamin and is often used {{as a source of}} the vitamin in multivitamin supplements. [...] Another common supplemental form of the vitamin is calcium <b>pantothenate.</b> [...] Calcium <b>pantothenate</b> is often used in dietary supplements because, as a salt, it is more stable than pantothenic acid.|$|E
2500|$|Pantothenic acid is the amide between pantoic {{acid and}} β-alanine. Its name {{derives from the}} Greek pantothen, meaning [...] "from everywhere", and small {{quantities}} of pantothenic acid are found in nearly every food, with high amounts in fortified whole-grain cereals, egg yolks, liver and dried mushrooms. [...] It is commonly found as its alcohol analog, the provitamin panthenol (pantothenol), and as calcium <b>pantothenate.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Pantothenate</b> kinase 4 is {{an enzyme}} (<b>pantothenate</b> kinase) that in humans is encoded by the PANK4 gene.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, {{specifically}} in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-pantothenate amidohydrolase. Other names in common use include <b>pantothenate</b> hydrolase, and <b>pantothenate</b> amidohydrolase. This enzyme participates in <b>pantothenate</b> and coa biosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|In {{the active}} site, <b>pantothenate</b> is {{oriented}} by hydrogen bonds between <b>pantothenate</b> {{and the side}} chains of aspartate, tyrosine, histidine, tyrosine, and asparagine residues. Asparagine, histidine, and arginine residues are involved in catalysis.|$|E
50|$|First, the ATP binds at {{the binding}} groove created by {{residues}} of the P loop and nearby residues. Here, the conserved lysine (Lys-101) {{is the key}} residue required for ATP binding. Additionally, the side chains of residues Lys-101, Ser-102, Glu-199, and Arg-243 orient the nucleotide in the binding groove. The <b>pantothenate</b> is bound and oriented by forming hydrogen bond interactions with residues Asp-127, Tyr-240, Asn-282, Tyr-175, and His-177. When both ATP and <b>pantothenate</b> are bound, Asp-127 deprotonates the C1 hydroxyl group of <b>pantothenate.</b> The oxygen from the <b>pantothenate</b> then attacks the γ-phosphate of the bound ATP. Here, charge stabilization of β- and γ-phosphate groups is achieved by Arg-243, Lys-101, and a coordinated Mg2+ ion. In this concerted mechanism, the planar phosphorane of the γ-phosphate is transferred in-line to the attacking oxygen of <b>pantothenate.</b> Finally, 4'-phosphopantothenate dissociates from PanK, followed by ADP.|$|E
50|$|The {{regulation}} of <b>pantothenate</b> kinase {{is essential to}} controlling the intracellular CoA concentration. <b>Pantothenate</b> kinase is regulated via feedback inhibition by CoA and its thioesters (i.e., acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA). CoA inhibits PanK activity by competitively binding to the ATP binding site and preventing ATP binding to Lys-101.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pantothenate</b> kinase ( [...] , PanK; CoaA) is {{the first}} enzyme in the Coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthetic pathway. It phosphorylates <b>pantothenate</b> (vitamin B5) to form 4'-phosphopantothenate {{at the expense of}} a {{molecule}} of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). It is the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of CoA. [...] CoA is a necessary cofactor in all living organisms. It acts as the major acyl group carrier in many important cellular processes, such as the citric acid cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) and fatty acid metabolism. Consequently, <b>pantothenate</b> kinase is a key regulatory enzyme in the CoA biosynthetic pathway.|$|E
