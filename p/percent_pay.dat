40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{reviews the}} {{incidence}} of income taxation in Bangladesh tax system. The main {{purpose of the study}} is to determine how the burden of personal and corporation income taxes is allocated among taxpayers of different income groups. In case of personal income taxes it shows that only 13 <b>percent</b> taxpayers <b>paying</b> around 73 <b>percent</b> of tax revenue collected through personal income taxes and interestingly about 53 <b>percent</b> taxpayers <b>pay</b> only 0. 08 percent taxes. In case of corporation income taxes the study shows similar results. For privately owned unlisted companies only 25 percent of them bears about 84 percent taxes earned through this sector and about 13 <b>percent</b> corporations <b>pay</b> nothing to the exchequer in the form of income taxes. Among the listed companies only 1. 15 <b>percent</b> of them <b>pay</b> about 53. 28 percent taxes and top 40 <b>percent</b> of them <b>pay</b> the entire taxes collected from this sector. The reasons identified behind such eccentric burden of taxes are, unlimited tax exemptions and tax holidays, poor tax base, inequality of taxing urban and rural sectors, special privileges to the public sectors, repeated tax amnesty etc. This study gives some recommendations, which could act as remedies for a better income tax system in Bangladesh and would relevant to other developing countries as well...|$|R
5|$|For the negotiations, {{the studio}} {{requested}} that the cast members accept a 45 percent cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the series' last. The actors {{were willing to take}} a pay cut, but wanted a percentage of the back-end payments instead. At one point Shearer even offered a 70 <b>percent</b> <b>pay</b> cut in exchange for back-end percentages, but the studio was unwilling to make any deal involving back-end percentages. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take a pay cut of 30 percent, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the voice actors, everybody involved in the show took a pay cut. This included animators, writers, the post-production crew and even Jean himself. The further use of digital animation also saves money, as the animation of the show becomes more efficient.|$|E
