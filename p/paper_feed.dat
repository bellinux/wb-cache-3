50|$|Similar to {{forensic}} identification of typewriters, computer printers and copiers {{can be traced}} by imperfections in their output. The mechanical tolerances of the toner and <b>paper</b> <b>feed</b> mechanisms cause banding, which can reveal information about the individual device's mechanical properties.

50|$|A {{baseline}} is {{representation of}} the output device settings (i.e. <b>paper</b> <b>feed,</b> head alignment, etc.) and associated conditions (i.e. media, ink, screening, etc.). A baseline is created by adjusting device settings under a given set of conditions and running test samples, measuring the samples, readjusting the settings, until the output process is brought to an optimal state. Once optimized, a final set of measurements are made of output samples and this data {{becomes part of the}} baseline information.|$|E

50|$|Some {{decades after}} its first development, the motor {{was used in}} {{telegraphy}} to power the <b>paper</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism for both Kelvin's and Muirhead's syphon recorders. These used a moving pen attached to a galvanometer to record telegraph signals. A paper roll was wound through the recorder by a Froment motor and the inked trace appeared as a wiggling line. Muirhead's design used a vibrating pen to avoid the ink causing the pen to stick against the tiny forces of the galvanometer. Kelvin's design instead used a hollow glass pen with an electrostatic charge to propel ink from the syphon tube. This charge was generated by an influence machine, also driven by the motor.|$|E

50|$|The ink {{consumed}} in the cleaning process needs to be collected to prevent ink from leaking in the printer. The collection area is called the spittoon, and in Hewlett Packard printers this is an open plastic tray underneath the cleaning/wiping station. In Epson printers, there is typically a large absorption pad in a pan underneath the <b>paper</b> <b>feed</b> platen. For printers several years old, {{it is common for}} the dried ink in the spittoon to form a pile that can stack up and touch the printheads, jamming the printer. Some larger professional printers using solvent inks may employ a replaceable plastic receptacle to contain waste ink and solvent which must be emptied or replaced when full.|$|E
50|$|Impact {{printers}} create noise {{when the}} pins or typeface strike the ribbon to the paper, and sound-damping enclosures {{may have to}} be used in quiet environments. They can only print lower-resolution graphics, with limited color performance, limited quality, and lower speeds compared to non-impact printers. While they support fanfold paper with tractor holes well, single-sheet paper {{may have to be}} wound in and aligned by hand, which is relatively time-consuming, or a sheet feeder may be utilized which can have a lower <b>paper</b> <b>feed</b> reliability. When printing labels on release paper, they are prone to paper jams when a print wire snags {{the leading edge of the}} label while printing at its very edge. For text-only labels (e.g. mailing labels), a daisy wheel printer or band printer may offer better print quality and a lower risk of damaging the paper.|$|E
50|$|The Ben Lane Printing Shop {{houses the}} type of {{equipment}} that a proprietor and his successors would accumulate in adapting their press to a half-century’s technological advancements. In {{the first decades of}} the 20th century print shops continued to use old-fashioned presses for specific purposes. In the case of the Ben Lane Printing Shop, even an 1820s vintage hand press remained in occasional service. Likewise, the Cotrell newspaper press, manufactured in 1871, rolled on a regular basis, as did a treadle-operated Dorman job press of the same vintage for smaller work. Although printers still utilized racks of wood and metal type, a complicated and often cantankerous Linotype machine fulfilled many of the shop’s composition requirements. The final addition of a high-speed Heidelberg press with automatic inking and <b>paper</b> <b>feed</b> operated quickly and efficiently and dramatically increased output.|$|E

Control characters in the data caused other actions, like the [...] or [...] The host could also have the printer automatically start a new line by pulling the AUTOFEED line high, and keeping it there.
