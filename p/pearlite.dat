5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called <b>pearlite,</b> named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the <b>pearlite</b> structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the <b>pearlite</b> structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of <b>pearlite</b> of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E

Foundry activity {{has a long history}} there and <b>Pearlite</b> Liners (P) Led., one of the oldest industries of Karnataka (earlier known as Bharath Foundry), is the largest private-sector employer in the district. , there were about 9800 industrial units in Shimoga District (small, medium and large), with more than 41,000 employees.|$|E
25|$|Wootz steel {{which is}} also known as Damascus steel was a unique and highly prized steel {{developed}} on the Indian subcontinent as early as the 5th century BC. Its properties were unique due to the special smelting and reworking of the steel creating networks of iron carbides described as a globular cementite in a matrix of <b>pearlite.</b> The use of Damascus steel in swords became extremely popular in the 16th and 17th centuries.|$|E
25|$|At this stage, {{it is only}} {{slightly}} curved or may have no curve at all. The katanas gentle curvature is attained by a process of differential hardening or differential quenching: the smith coats the blade with several layers of a wet clay slurry, which is a special concoction unique to each sword maker, but generally composed of clay, water and any or none of ash, grinding stone powder, or rust. This process is called tsuchioki. The edge of the blade is coated with a thinner layer than the sides and spine of the sword, heated, and then quenched in water (few sword makers use oil to quench the blade). The slurry causes only the blade's edge to be hardened and also causes the blade to curve due to the difference in densities of the micro-structures in the steel. When steel with a carbon content of 0.7% is heated beyond 750°C, it enters the austenite phase. When austenite is cooled very suddenly by quenching in water, the structure changes into martensite, {{which is a very}} hard form of steel. When austenite is allowed to cool slowly, its structure changes into a mixture of ferrite and <b>pearlite</b> which is softer than martensite. This process also creates the distinct line down the sides of the blade called the hamon, which is made distinct by polishing. Each hamon and each smith's style of hamon is distinct.|$|E
500|$|... "White" [...] {{cast irons}} contain their carbon {{in the form}} of cementite, or iron carbide (Fe3C). This hard, brittle {{compound}} dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron-carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. Cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8% carbon slowly below 723°C to room temperature results in separate, alternating layers of cementite and ferrite, which is soft and malleable and is called <b>pearlite</b> for its appearance. Rapid cooling, on the other hand, does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle martensite. The steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between, changing the proportions of <b>pearlite</b> and martensite. The end product below 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-ferrite mixture, and that above 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-cementite mixture.|$|E

50|$|Austenite is {{slightly}} undercooled when quenched below Eutectoid temperature. When given more time, stable microconstituents can form: ferrite and cementite. Coarse <b>pearlite</b> is produced when atoms diffuse rapidly after phases that form <b>pearlite</b> nucleate. This transformation is complete at the <b>pearlite</b> finish time (Pf).|$|E
50|$|Austempering is a {{technique}} used to form pure bainite, a transitional microstructure found between <b>pearlite</b> and martensite. In normalizing, both upper and lower bainite are usually found mixed with <b>pearlite.</b> To avoid the formation of <b>pearlite</b> or martensite, the steel is quenched in a bath of molten metals or salts. This quickly cools the steel past the point where <b>pearlite</b> can form, and into the bainite-forming range. The steel is then held at the bainite-forming temperature, beyond {{the point where the}} temperature reaches an equilibrium, until the bainite fully forms. The steel is then removed from the bath and allowed to air-cool, without the formation of either <b>pearlite</b> or martensite.|$|E
50|$|Ledeburite-II (at ambient temperature) is {{composed}} of cementite-I with recrystallized secondary cementite (which separates from austenite as the metal cools) and (with slow cooling) of <b>pearlite.</b> The <b>pearlite</b> results from the eutectoidal decay of the austenite {{that comes from the}} ledeburite-I at 723 °C. During more rapid cooling, bainite can develop instead of <b>pearlite,</b> and with very rapid cooling martensite can develop.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pearlite</b> is a two-phased, {{lamellar}} (or layered) structure {{composed of}} alternating layers of ferrite (88 wt%) and cementite (12 wt%) that occurs in some steels and cast irons. During slow cooling of an iron-carbon alloy, <b>pearlite</b> forms by a eutectoid reaction as austenite cools below 727 C (the eutectoid temperature). <b>Pearlite</b> is a microstructure occurring in many common grades of steels.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>pearlite</b> {{is harder}} than iron, {{the degree of}} {{softness}} achievable is typically limited to that produced by the <b>pearlite.</b> Similarly, the hardenability {{is limited by the}} continuous martensitic microstructure formed when cooled very fast.|$|E
50|$|HSLA steels {{are also}} more {{resistant}} to rust than most carbon steels because of their lack of <b>pearlite</b> - the fine layers of ferrite (almost pure iron) and cementite in <b>pearlite.</b> HSLA steels usually have densities of around 7800 kg/m³.|$|E

50|$|A {{hypereutectoid}} steel {{contains more than}} 0.77% carbon. When slowly cooling a {{hypereutectoid steel}}, the cementite will begin to crystallize first. When the remaining steel becomes eutectoid in composition, it will crystallize into <b>pearlite.</b> Since cementite is much harder than <b>pearlite,</b> the alloy has greater hardenability at a cost in the ductility.|$|E

5000|$|If {{the steel}} is cooled slowly the {{transformation}} {{will agree with}} the equilibrium predictions and <b>pearlite</b> will dominate the microstructure with some fraction of proeutectoid ferrite or cementite depending on the chemical composition. However, the transformation from austenite to <b>pearlite</b> is a time-dependent reconstructive reaction which requires the large scale movement of the iron and carbon atoms. While the interstitial carbon diffuses readily even at moderate temperatures the self-diffusion of iron becomes extremely slow at temperatures below 600 °C until, for all practical purposes, it stops. As a consequence a rapidly cooled steel may reach a temperature where <b>pearlite</b> can no longer form despite the reaction being incomplete and the remaining austenite being thermodynamically unstable.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{both the}} <b>pearlite</b> and {{martensite}} can be polished to a mirror-like shine, only {{the back and}} spine are usually polished to such an extent. The hardened portion of the blade (yakiba) and the center portion (hira) are often given a matte finish instead, to make {{the differences in the}} hardness stand out. This causes the various microstructures to reflect light differently when viewed from different angles. The <b>pearlite</b> takes on longer, deeper scratches, and either appears shiny and bright, or sometimes dark depending on the viewing angle. The martensite is harder to scratch, so the microscopic abrasions are smaller. The martensite usually appears brighter yet flatter than the <b>pearlite,</b> and this is less dependent on the viewing angle. When polished or etched with acid to reveal these features, a distinct boundary is observed between the martensite portion of the blade and the <b>pearlite.</b> This boundary is often called the [...] "temper line", or the commonly used Japanese term, the [...] "hamon". Between the hardened edge and the hamon lies an intermediate zone, called the '"nioi" [...] in Japanese, which is usually only visible at long angles. The nioi is about a millimeter or two wide, following the hamon, which is made up of individual martensite grains (niye) surrounded by <b>pearlite.</b> The nioi provides a very tough boundary between the yakiba and the hira.|$|E
50|$|Mild steel (carbon steel with up {{to about}} 0.2 wt% C) consist mostly of ferrite and {{increasing}} amounts of cementite (iron carbide) in a laminar structure called <b>pearlite.</b> Since bainite and <b>pearlite</b> each have ferrite as a component, any iron-carbon alloy will contain some amount of ferrite if it is allowed to reach equilibrium at room temperature. The exact amount of ferrite {{will depend on the}} cooling process the iron-carbon alloy undergoes as it cools.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} range for transformation of austenite to bainite (250-550 °C) is between those for <b>pearlite</b> and martensite. When formed during continuous cooling, the cooling rate to form bainite is more rapid than that required to form <b>pearlite,</b> but less rapid than {{is required to}} form martensite (in steels of the same composition). Most alloying elements will lower the temperature required for the maximum rate of formation of bainite, though carbon {{is the most effective}} in doing so.|$|E
50|$|A {{hypoeutectoid}} steel contains less than 0.77% carbon. Upon cooling a {{hypoeutectoid steel}} from the austenite transformation temperature, small islands of proeutectoid-ferrite will form. These {{will continue to}} grow and the carbon will recede until the eutectoid concentration {{in the rest of the}} steel is reached. This eutectoid mixture will then crystallize as a microstructure of <b>pearlite.</b> Since ferrite is softer than <b>pearlite,</b> the two microstructures combine to increase the ductility of the alloy. Consequently, the hardenability of the alloy is lowered.|$|E
5000|$|Isothermal {{transformation}} (IT) diagram or the C-curve {{is associated}} with mechanical properties, microconstituents/microstructures, and heat treatments in carbon steels. Diffusional transformations like austenite transforming to a cementite and ferrite mixture can be explained using the sigmoidal curve; For example the beginning of pearlitic transformation {{is represented by the}} <b>pearlite</b> start (Ps) curve. This transformation is complete at Pf curve. Nucleation requires an incubation time. The rate of nucleation increases and the rate of microconstituent growth decreases as the temperature decreases from the liquidus temperature reaching a maximum at the bay or nose of the curve. Thereafter, the decrease in diffusion rate due to low temperature offsets the effect of increased driving force due to greater difference in free energy. As a result of the transformation, the microconstituents, <b>Pearlite</b> and Bainite, form; <b>Pearlite</b> [...] forms at higher temperatures and bainite at lower.|$|E
50|$|Wootz {{steel is}} a {{crucible}} steel {{characterized by a}} pattern of bands, which are formed by sheets of micro carbides within a tempered martensite or <b>pearlite</b> matrix in higher carbon steel, or by ferrite and <b>pearlite</b> banding in lower carbon steels. It is the pioneering steel alloy matrix developed in Southern India in the 6th century BC and exported globally. It was also known {{in the ancient world}} by many different names including Wootz, Ukku, Hindvi Steel, Hinduwani Steel, Teling Steel and Seric Iron.|$|E

5000|$|Pearlite-reduced steels: {{low carbon}} content steels {{which lead to}} little or no <b>pearlite,</b> but rather a very fine grain ferrite matrix. It is {{strengthened}} by precipitation hardening.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} heat {{treating}} carbon steel {{is to change}} the mechanical properties of steel, usually ductility, hardness, yield strength, or impact resistance. Note that the electrical and thermal conductivity are only slightly altered. As with most strengthening techniques for steel, Young's modulus (elasticity) is unaffected. All treatments of steel trade ductility for increased strength and vice versa. Iron has a higher solubility for carbon in the austenite phase; therefore all heat treatments, except spheroidizing and process annealing, start by heating the steel to a temperature at which the austenitic phase can exist. The steel is then quenched (heat drawn out) at a moderate to low rate allowing carbon to diffuse out of the austenite forming iron-carbide (cementite) to precipitate leaving ferrite, or at a high rate, trapping the carbon within the iron thus forming martensite. The rate at which the steel is cooled through the eutectoid temperature (about 727°C) affects the rate at which carbon diffuses out of austenite and forms cementite. Generally speaking, cooling swiftly will leave iron carbide finely dispersed and produce a fine grained <b>pearlite</b> and cooling slowly will give a coarser <b>pearlite.</b> Cooling a hypoeutectoid steel (less than 0.77 wt% C) results in a lamellar-pearlitic structure of iron carbide layers with α-ferrite (nearly pure iron) between. If it is hypereutectoid steel (more than 0.77 wt% C) then the structure is full <b>pearlite</b> with small grains (larger than the <b>pearlite</b> lamella) of cementite formed on the grain boundaries. A eutectoid steel (0.77% carbon) will have a <b>pearlite</b> structure throughout the grains with no cementite at the boundaries. The relative amounts of constituents are found using the lever rule. The following is a list of the types of heat treatments possible: ...|$|E
50|$|Early {{research}} on bainite found {{that at a}} given temperature only a certain volume fraction of the austenite would transform to bainite with the remainder decomposing to <b>pearlite</b> after an extended delay. This was the case {{despite the fact that}} a complete austenite to <b>pearlite</b> transformation could be achieved at higher temperatures where the austenite was more stable. The fraction of bainite that could form increased as the temperature decreased. This was ultimately explained by accounting for the fact that when the bainitic ferrite formed the supersaturated carbon would be expelled to the surrounding austenite thus thermodynamically stabilising it against further transformation.|$|E
50|$|Examples of symplectites {{formed in}} Earth {{materials}} include dolomite + calcite, aragonite + calcite, and magnetite + clinopyroxene. Symplectite formation {{is important in}} metallurgy: bainite or <b>pearlite</b> formation from the decomposition of austenite, for example.|$|E

50|$|Type 1 telluric iron {{contains}} {{a significant amount}} of carbon. Type 1 is a white nickel cast-iron, containing 1.7 to 4% carbon and 0.05 to 4% nickel, which is very hard and brittle and does not respond well to cold working. The structure of type 1 consists mainly of <b>pearlite</b> and cementite or cohenite, with inclusions of troilite and silicate. The individual ferrite grains are typically about a millimeter in size. Although the composition of the grains may vary, even within the same grain, they are mostly composed of fairly pure nickel-ferrite. The ferrite grains are connected with cementite laminations; typically 5 to 25 micrometers thick; forming the <b>pearlite.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pearlite</b> {{was first}} {{identified}} by Henry Clifton Sorby and initially named sorbite, however {{the similarity of}} microstructure to nacre and especially the optical effect caused by {{the scale of the}} structure made the alternative name more popular.|$|E
50|$|These bars {{therefore}} {{exhibit a}} variation in microstructure in their cross section, having strong, tough, tempered martensite {{in the surface}} layer of the bar, an intermediate layer of martensite and bainite, and a refined, tough and ductile ferrite and <b>pearlite</b> core.|$|E
50|$|Before hardening, cast steels {{and iron}} {{are of a}} uniform and lammelar (or layered) {{pearlitic}} grain structure. This {{is a mixture of}} ferrite and cementite formed when steel or cast iron are manufactured and cooled at a slow rate. <b>Pearlite</b> is not an ideal material for many common applications of steel alloys as it is quite soft. By heating <b>pearlite</b> past its eutectoid transition temperature of 727 °C and then rapidly cooling, some of the material’s crystal structure can be transformed into a much harder structure known as martensite. Steels with this martensitic structure are often used in applications when the workpiece must be highly resistant to deformation, such as the cutting edge of blades.|$|E
