40|$|AIMS: To {{develop a}} model for {{estimating}} the immediate and long-term healthcare costs associated with seven diabetes-related complications in patients with Type 2 diabetes participating in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). METHODS: The costs associated with some major complications were estimated using data on 5102 UKPDS patients (mean age 52. 4 years at diagnosis). In-patient and out-patient costs were estimated using multiple regression analysis based on costs calculated from the length of admission multiplied by the average specialty cost and a survey of 3488 UKPDS patients' healthcare usage conducted in 1996 - 1997. RESULTS: Using the model, the estimate {{of the cost of}} first complications were as follows: amputation <b>pound</b> 8459 (95 % confidence interval <b>pound</b> 5295, <b>pound</b> 13 200); non-fatal myocardial infarction <b>pound</b> 4070 (<b>pound</b> 3580, <b>pound</b> 4722); fatal myocardial infarction <b>pound</b> 1152 (<b>pound</b> 941, <b>pound</b> 1396); fatal stroke <b>pound</b> 3383 (<b>pound</b> 1935, <b>pound</b> 5431); non-fatal stroke <b>pound</b> 2367 (<b>pound</b> 1599, <b>pound</b> 3274); ischaemic heart disease <b>pound</b> 1959 (<b>pound</b> 1467, <b>pound</b> 2541); heart failure <b>pound</b> 2221 (<b>pound</b> 1690, <b>pound</b> 2896); cataract extraction <b>pound</b> 1553 (<b>pound</b> 1320, <b>pound</b> 1855); and blindness in one eye <b>pound</b> 872 (<b>pound</b> 526, <b>pound</b> 1299). The annual average in-patient cost of events in subsequent years ranged from <b>pound</b> 631 (<b>pound</b> 403, <b>pound</b> 896) for heart failure to <b>pound</b> 105 (<b>pound</b> 80, <b>pound</b> 142) for cataract extraction. Non-in-patient costs for macrovascular complications were <b>pound</b> 315 (<b>pound</b> 247, <b>pound</b> 394) and for microvascular complications were <b>pound</b> 273 (<b>pound</b> 215, <b>pound</b> 343) in the year of the event. In each subsequent year the costs were, respectively, <b>pound</b> 258 (<b>pound</b> 228, <b>pound</b> 297) and <b>pound</b> 204 (<b>pound</b> 181, <b>pound</b> 255). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide estimates of the immediate and long-term healthcare costs associated with seven diabetes-related complications...|$|R

5|$|While bishop, Hervey {{ordered the}} {{compilation}} {{of a history}} of the refounding of the abbey of Ely, which later became incorporated into the Liber Eliensis. This was a Latin reworking of an Old English book of grants compiled by Bishop Ã†thelwold of Winchester. He was energetic in recovering the feudal rights of the bishopric against knights who had intruded themselves on the lands, but were not rendering knight service to the bishop. As bishop, he attended a legatine council, or council held by a papal legate, in 1127, and a royal council in 1129, but otherwise his administrative actions remain obscure. The causeway between the island of Ely and Exning, which made it easier for pilgrims to visit the shrine of Saint Ethelreda, was built under Hervey's orders. Insight into his activities as bishop is given in the Pipe Roll of 1130, the first surviving Pipe Roll. In that record, Hervey is recorded as owing King Henry 45 <b>pounds</b> to provide an office for a nephew, 100 <b>pounds</b> on an old settlement with the king, another 100 <b>pounds</b> for the settlement of a case dealing with Ramsey Abbey, Bury St. Edmunds Abbey and the bishop, 240 <b>pounds</b> for the right to be rid of a surplus of knights, and finally 1000 <b>pounds</b> for the king to allow the bishop's knights to serve castleguard at Ely instead of Norwich.|$|E

In 1527, the Tower <b>pound</b> was replaced by the English modern troy <b>pound</b> of 373,3 g, which was, by law, equal to exactly 16/15 of a Tower pound.The fundamental unit of the pre-1527 English weight system known as Tower weights, was a different sort of grain known as the [...] "wheat grain".The Tower <b>pound</b> had a mass of 240 x 32 = 7680 wheat grain. The Tower wheat grain was defined as exactly [...] of a troy grain. Expressed in modern English troy grains, the Tower <b>pound</b> was 7680 x [...] = 5400 modern troy grains (350 g). The Tower <b>pound</b> was divided into 12 ounces, each ounce into 20 pennyweights, and each pennyweight into 24 barleycorns. There were thus 480 barleycorns to a Tower ounce, 5760 barleycorns to a Tower <b>pound</b> of 350 g. The Anglo-Saxon <b>pound</b> (Saxon <b>pound,</b> moneyers' <b>pound</b> or Tower <b>pound)</b> remained in use for silver and gold coinage in England after the adoption of the medieval troy <b>pound</b> of 367.5 g. This <b>pound</b> of 12 ounces was in use in Troyes (Champagne fairs) where the mark of 8 ounces (also the Paris mark) weighed 245 g. The medieval troy <b>pound</b> weighed 240 pennyweights of 1.53 g or 24 medieval troy grains (1/5760 part of the new <b>pound</b> and heavier than the real barleycorn).

40|$|Background: The {{changes to}} out of hours care {{provided}} by General Practitioners {{have led to}} wide variation in the types and costs of out of hours care across the country. Aim To examine the costs of different models of service delivery for GP out of hours organisations. Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional survey of eight GP out of hours organisations and samples of their patients. A deputising service, rotas, and various types of GP co-operative across Scotland were surveyed. Information on the quantities of resources used by each organisation was combined with unit costs, Costs incurred by patients mid other NHS costs subsequent to the out of hours contact were also calculated Results: Annual costs incurred by the GP out of hours organisation per 1, 000 population ranged from <b>pound</b> 2, 916 to <b>pound</b> 12, 120. There was no relationship between costs and type and size of organisation. There was a three-fold variation in total costs per our of hours contact (<b>pound</b> 15 to <b>pound</b> 51). Costs per phone contact were lowest (<b>pound</b> 6 to <b>pound</b> 11), followed by cost per centre contact (<b>pound</b> 10 to <b>pound</b> 16) and cost per home contact (<b>pound</b> 21 to <b>pound</b> 60), Total costs per episode ranged from <b>pound</b> 78 to <b>pound</b> 136 for centre contacts, from <b>pound</b> 130 to <b>pound</b> 303 for home contacts, and from <b>pound</b> 70 to <b>pound</b> 553 for telephone contacts. Home contacts had the highest average cost per episode (<b>pound</b> 212), followed by telephone contacts (<b>pound</b> 117) and centre contacts (<b>pound</b> 85), Conclusions: There are wide variations in the costs of operating GP out of hours services. It {{is likely that the}} context in which organisations were set up and local geography influence variations in costs, as well as the level of GP cover. status: publishe...|$|R
