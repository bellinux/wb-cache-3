5|$|Hayes {{hoped to}} remain out of {{politics}} {{in order to pay}} off the debts he had incurred during the Panic, but when the Republican state convention nominated him for governor in 1875, he accepted. The campaign against Democratic nominee William Allen focused primarily on Protestant fears of the possibility of state aid to Catholic schools. Hayes was against such funding and, while he was not known to be personally anti-Catholic, he allowed anti-Catholic fervor to contribute to the enthusiasm for his candidacy. The campaign was a success, and Hayes was returned to the governorship by a 5,544-vote majority. The first person to earn a third term as Governor of Ohio, Hayes reduced the state debt, re-established the Board of Charities, and repealed the Geghan Bill, which had allowed for the appointment of Catholic priests to schools and <b>penitentiaries.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Following the {{development}} of the <b>penitentiary</b> by the Philadelphia Quakers in the 1780s, the concept of penitence—isolation, work and religious contemplation—influenced the design and operation of prisons, not only in North America, but also in Europe, South America and Asia. The [...] "Auburn System" [...] developed at the Auburn <b>Penitentiary</b> in New York adopted the <b>penitentiary</b> sentence of the Philadelphia model, but added prisoners' labour, in the belief that work and training would assist in reforming criminals. The Kingston <b>Penitentiary,</b> based on the Auburn System, was built in 1835. Initially operated as a provincial jail, the <b>penitentiary</b> came under federal jurisdiction following the passage of the British North America Act in 1867. [...] In 1868, the first <b>Penitentiary</b> Act brought prisons in Saint John, New Brunswick and Halifax, along with Kingston, under federal jurisdiction. Over the next twelve years, the federal government built Saint-Vincent-de-Paul <b>Penitentiary</b> in Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec (1873), Manitoba <b>Penitentiary,</b> in Stoney Mountain, Manitoba (1877), British Columbia <b>Penitentiary,</b> in New Westminster, British Columbia (1878) and Dorchester <b>Penitentiary,</b> in Dorchester, New Brunswick (1880).|$|R
25|$|Following Howard's agitation, the Penitentiary Act {{was passed}} in 1779. This {{introduced}} solitary confinement, religious instruction, a labor regime, and proposed two state <b>penitentiaries</b> (one for men and one for women). However, these were never built due to disagreements in the committee and pressures from wars with France, and gaols remained a local responsibility. But other measures passed {{in the next few}} years provided magistrates with the powers to implement many of these reforms, and eventually, in 1815, gaol fees were abolished.|$|E

While Tocqueville did visit some prisons, he traveled widely in America and took extensive notes about his observations and reflections. He returned within nine months, and published a report, but the real result of his tour was De la démocratie en Amerique, which appeared in 1835. Beaumont also wrote an account of their travels in Jacksonian America: Marie or Slavery in the United States (1835). During this trip he made a side trip to Lower Canada to Montreal and Quebec City from mid August to early September 1831.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1770 Voght {{had come in}} contact with prisons, when, {{representing}} his father, he had shown the English prison reformer John Howard around Hamburg's penitentiary. From that time he maintained a great interest in matters related to poorhouses and prisons. Together {{with the head of the}} trade academy (Handelsakademie) Johann Georg Büsch and the lawyer Johann Arnold Günther, Voght initiated in 1788 the establishment of a 'common institution for the poor' (Allgemeinen Armenanstalt) with which he reformed Hamburg's poor provision. The foundation of this reform was the division of the city into care zones whose approximately 200 inhabitants were entrusted with finding voluntary means of caring for the poor in that zone. The institute guaranteed medical attention for the poor, support during pregnancy and childbirth, and education and work for poor children. In contrast to the prevailing mode of providing for the poor, which was usually ecclesiastical and focused on moral and spiritual aspects of the situation, the reform was directed towards the economic needs of those affected. The cost of the effort was met by tithes collected in churches and weekly collections for the poor. As a result of this effort, the number of occupants in Hamburg's <b>penitentiaries</b> sank drastically.|$|E

500|$|On January 10, 1935, {{a severe}} storm caused a {{landslide}} on Alcatraz, causing the Model Industries Building to slide. This marked {{the start of}} a series of changes to the structures on the island. A riprap was built around it and it was strengthened and a guard tower added to the roof in June 1936, and the same month the barracks building was remodeled into 11 new apartments and nine single rooms for bachelors; by this time there were 52 families living on Alcatraz Island, including 126 women and children. The problems with the industries building and continuing utility problems with some of the old buildings and systems led to extensive updates in 1937, including new tool-proof grills on the ventilators {{on the roof of the}} cell house, two new boilers installed in the power house and a new pump for salt water sanitation and guardrails added to stairways. In 1939–40, a $1.1 million redevelopment was under swing, including construction of the New Industries Building, a complete overhaul of the power house with a new diesel engine, the building of a new water tower to solve the water storage problem, new apartment blocks for officers, improvements to the dock, and the conversion of D-block into isolation cells. The changes were completed in July 1941. [...] The workshops of the New Industries Building became highly productive in the making of army uniforms and cargo nets and other items which were in high demand during World War II and in June 1945 it was reported that the federal <b>penitentiaries</b> had made 60,000 nets.|$|E
500|$|Alcatraz was {{designed}} to hold prisoners who continuously caused trouble at other federal prisons, a [...] "last resort prison" [...] to hold {{the worst of the}} worst criminals who had no hope of rehabilitation. At 9:40 am on August 11, 1934, the first batch of 137 prisoners arrived at Alcatraz, arriving by railroad from the United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas to Santa Venetia, California, before being escorted to Alcatraz they were handcuffed in high security coaches and guarded by some 60 FBI special agents, U.S. Marshals, and railway security officials. Some 32 detainees from the original military prison were reported to have been amongst the first inmates. Most of the prisoners were notorious bank robbers and counterfeiters, murderers, or sodomites. Amongst the first inmates were also 14 men from McNeil Island, Washington. On August 22, 43 prisoners arrived from Atlanta Penitentiary and 10 from North Eastern Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. On September 1, one prisoner arrived from Washington Asylum and Jail and seven from the District of Columbia Reformatory in Virginia, and on September 4, another batch of 103 prisoners arrived by train from Leavenworth. Prisoners continued to arrive, mainly from Leavenworth and Atlanta in 1935 and by June 30, 1935, the penitentiary had a population of 242 prisoners, although some prisoners such as Verrill Rapp had already been transferred from Alcatraz some months earlier. On the first anniversary as a federal penitentiary, on June 30, 1935, the Bureau of Prisons observed that: [...] "The establishment of this institution not only provided a secure place for the detention of the more difficult type of criminal but has had a good effect upon discipline in our other <b>penitentiaries</b> also. No serious disturbance of any kind has been reported during the year." [...] The metal detectors initially caused a problem by overheating and often had to be turned off. After the failure of the Teletouch Corporation to amend the problem, in 1937 their contract was terminated and they were charged over $200 for three new detectors supplied by Federal Laboratories.|$|E
