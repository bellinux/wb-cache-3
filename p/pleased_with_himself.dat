The Fingerprint (1926) is a detective {{story about an}} unsolved crime where the {{evidence}} consists of unusually large thumbprints.

500|$|Later, as Brian and Stewie {{drive home}} from his day care, they listen to the 2006 single [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] on the car's radio, sung by American Idol winner Carrie Underwood. Stewie stays in the car after {{arriving}} home {{to listen to the}} rest of the song, and sings along. <b>Pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>himself,</b> he decides he should appear on the Fox television series Glee. Later Stewie learns of a contest to win tickets to a local Justin Bieber concert, but ultimately he loses the contest to his neighbor, Herbert. After returning home, Stewie begins watching a film parodying various 1970s science fiction movies (including music parodying the 1976 Michael York film Logan's Run) before being accused by Brian of crashing his car. When Stewie tries to reject blame for the incident, Brian tells him that he must accept his punishment, and compares it to the television game show The Price Is Right, in which a woman is shown accepting a poor showcase, involving a weeklong trip to her parent's house in Wilmington, Delaware. Stewie then runs away from home, leaving a video message for Brian asking Brian to rescue him in a TV-movie-clich√©d way at the airport, and to bring appropriate soundtrack music, suggesting [...] "With or Without You" [...] by U2, [...] "Solsbury Hill" [...] by Peter Gabriel, [...] "Unwritten" [...] by Natasha Bedingfield, [...] "Live Like We're Dying" [...] by Kris Allen, [...] "Thank You" [...] by Dido and [...] "Somebody" [...] by Depeche Mode.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "chuffed to one's bollocks" [...] {{describes}} {{someone who}} is very <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>himself.</b> [...] Nobel laureate Harold Pinter used this in The Homecoming The phrase provided a serious challenge to translators of his work. Pinter used a similar phrase in an open letter, published in The Guardian, and addressed to Prime Minister Tony Blair, attacking his co-operation with American foreign policy. The letter ends by saying [...] "Oh, by the way, meant to mention, forgot to tell you, we were all chuffed to the bollocks when Labour won the election".|$|E

He went up and down two or three times, and I never saw anything so ridikerlous in my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear Maude," [...] said Cecilia, [...] "pray {{let him do}} what he <b>pleases</b> <b>with</b> <b>himself</b> {{in these}} {{the last days of}} his liberty. When he has got a wife he must attend to her,--more or less. Now he is as free as air. Pray let him do as he pleases, and for heaven's sake do not bother him!" [...] Maude who had her own lover, and was {{perfectly}} satisfied with him though she had been engaged to him for nearly twelve months, knew that things were not going well, and was unhappy. But at the moment she said nothing further.|$|R
2500|$|As seen by Radu R. Rosetti, Kalinderu appears [...] "sententious, ridiculous, {{but very}} much {{appreciated}} by the King". Reportedly, {{he worked for}} free at the crown domains, refusing to collect his salary: [...] "The only rewards he desires are peasant blessings and his playing billiards with His Majesty." [...] The king's appreciation was strictly contextual, a fact noticed by the politician Ion G. Duca: although Kalideru [...] "entertained illusions" [...] that he was personal friends with Carol, the latter [...] "made sure to dispel it"; the courtier could be the king's [...] "servant and useful instrument, but never his friend." [...] Reportedly, Carol also ordered Kalinderu to admonish Crown Prince Ferdinand and Princess Marie for their lavish spending. The future Queen Marie was much amused by Kalinderu, describing him as [...] "little, round, with a short beard and a pronounced Semitic nose; one of his eyes sparkled wickedly, showing an unusually sharp intelligence". She recalled a visit with him to Windsor Castle, where [...] "it was truly amusing to see the short gentleman very <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>himself,</b> catching everything with his glimpse, weighing, judging, taking the measure of people and things, with that small, penetrating, almost wicked eye". Even when meeting Queen Victoria, his eye [...] "roved throughout, as if he feared missing something". When he was shown the castle's art treasures, he observed them [...] "with the superior air {{of a man in}} the know, {{of a man who was}} familiar with valuable collections".|$|E
2500|$|When Sue {{begins to}} tire {{of life in}} Walford, Ali tries to get funds {{together}} to facilitate their move. In doing so, he runs up huge gambling debts to Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem), manageress of Strokes wine bar, {{also a member of}} the criminal underworld known as The Firm. Desperate for money to hide his losses from Sue, Ali asks Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) for a loan. Ian agrees and charges him 10 percent interest. Ali continues to gamble, struggling to pay Ian until he manages to win. <b>Pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>himself,</b> Ali's boasting catches the attention of Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler); she seduces Ali and after they have sex, Donna blackmails Ali, threatening to tell Sue unless he pays her. Ali pays but Donna tells Sue [...] regardless when Sue insults her. Devastated, Sue turns to Mehmet for comfort and wanting revenge, she kisses him in front of Ali. Thinking that his brother has been sleeping with his wife, Ali attacks Mehmet and banishes him from his life and after much rowing, Sue and Little Ali leave. Ali searches for Sue and eventually finds her visiting Hassan's grave and snatches Little Ali back. Losing another son makes Sue have a breakdown and she is sectioned. Now a single father, Ali struggles to keep his businesses afloat. He cannot afford the rent increase and attempts an insurance scam by torching his cafe, which is witnessed by Ian. Ian uses the situation to his advantage, forcing Ali to sign the cafe over to him. This causes a feud between them when Ali neglects to mention that the kitchen utilities were bought on hire purchase and are later repossessed. Ali struggles with juggling work and parental responsibilities. He has to resign from Frank Butcher's (Mike Reid) car lot when he discovers his child-minder is neglecting his son. He takes up mini-cabbying but when his car is stolen, he can't work so he is forced to send Little Ali to live with his parents. With no money, Ali attends a game of poker but loses to his landlord Alan McIntyre (Pip Miller), whom Ali had feuded with since 1987. As a result, Ali is evicted when he can't pay the rent. In a fury, Ali smashes up the flat with a crowbar, breaking all the windows and doors, until his family send him and Little Ali to Northern Cyprus in October 1989.|$|E

60|$|I {{believe there}} is a genuine popular sovereignty. I think a {{definition}} of genuine popular sovereignty in the abstract would be about this: that each man shall do precisely as he <b>pleases</b> <b>with</b> <b>himself,</b> and <b>with</b> all those things which exclusively concern him. Applied to governments, this principle would be, that a general government shall do all those things which pertain to it; and all the local governments shall do precisely as they please in respect to those matters which exclusively concern them. I understand that this government of the United States under which we live, is based upon this principle; and I am misunderstood if it is supposed that I have any war to make upon that principle.|$|R

60|$|Mr Toots {{responded with}} a chuckle. Thinking that might be too lively, he {{corrected}} it with a sigh. Thinking that might be too melancholy, he corrected it with a chuckle. Not thoroughly <b>pleasing</b> <b>himself</b> <b>with</b> either mode of reply, he breathed hard.|$|R
60|$|I {{finished}} my sittings to Lawrence, and am heartily sorry {{there should be}} another picture of me except that which he has finished.

He has represented the author as in the act of composition, yet has effectually discharged all affectation from the manner and attitude.

60|$|Now, in {{relation}} to his inference that I am in favour of a general consolidation of all the local institutions of the various States.... I have said very many times in Judge Douglas's hearing that no man believed more than I in the principle of self-government; that it lies {{at the bottom of}} all my ideas of just government from beginning to end. I have denied that his use of that term applies properly. But for the thing itself I deny that any man has ever gone ahead of me in his devotion to the principle, whatever he may have done in efficiency in advocating it. I think that I have said it in your hearing, that I believe each individual is naturally entitled to do as he <b>pleases</b> <b>with</b> <b>himself</b> and the fruit of his labour, so far as it in no wise interferes with any other man's rights; that each community, as a State, has a right to do exactly as it <b>pleases</b> <b>with</b> all the concerns within that State that interfere with the right of no other State; and that the general government upon principle has no right to interfere with anything other than that general class of things that does concern the whole.

60|$|Idikut {{was very}} much pleased, when his {{messengers}} returned, to learn that his mission had been so successful.

He accordingly prepared some splendid presents, and, placing himself {{at the head of}} his troop of guards, he proceeded to the camp of Genghis Khan.

60|$|Now, in {{relation}} to his inference that I am {{in favor of a}} general consolidation of all the local institutions of the various States. I will attend to that for a little while, and try to inquire, if I can, how on earth it could be that any man could draw such an inference from anything I said. I have said, very many times, in Judge Douglas's hearing, that no man believed more than I in the principle of self-government; that it lies at the bottom of all my ideas of just government, from beginning to end.

I have said that at all times.
