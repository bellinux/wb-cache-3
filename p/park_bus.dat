5|$|Canterbury Castle was {{designed}} by Jeter O. Frye and constructed between 1929 and 1931. Immediately following construction, Frye was unable {{to sell the house}} and left Portland in bankruptcy to resume his career in California. Visitors immediately showed interest in touring the house. The castle attracted paying tourists and school groups, became a stop on the Washington <b>Park</b> <b>bus</b> tour and hosted Halloween parties for a local radio station. The house became known as Canterbury Castle over time due to the plat and name of the street on which it was situated. The terraced garden was eliminated in the 1950s when a portion of the land was sold. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under the ownership of Dale and Karen Bernards, who had submitted an application for listing one year prior.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the surface}} {{stations}} on the Fairlop loop and the underground stations on the Hainault loop are notable for their architecture, dating from Edwardian to the London Transport style of the 1930s/1940s. The bus station shelter at Newbury Park won a Festival of Britain award in 1951, and both it and Barkingside station are Grade II Listed buildings. The interior of Gants Hill was heavily inspired by the Moscow Metro. Gants Hill lacks a proper station building, being directly underneath the busy A12 roundabout. Due to bomb damage to Grange Hill in 1944, and expansion of the A12 Eastern Avenue at Newbury Park in 1956, the original station buildings were demolished. They were almost identical to that at Chigwell. Newbury Park was meant to receive a replacement building {{but it was never}} built, and the only entrance is via the bus station. Hainault's original structure, prior to rebuilding due to the addition of Hainault Depot, was very similar to that at Fairlop. Roding Valley had rather basic buildings on opening, with a wooden shelter on the Woodford-bound side, replaced by more substantial structures when transferred to the Central line. Notable architects included Oliver Hill for Newbury <b>Park</b> <b>bus</b> station and W. N. Ashbee for the original six stations from Chigwell to Newbury Park (though the Listing authorities credit William Burgess for Barkingside, possibly erroneously). Renowned London Underground architect Charles Holden designed the three new underground stations that opened in 1947.|$|E

2500|$|The {{park has}} {{also served as}} a major {{downtown}} transit center. [...] Two years after the destruction of the state capitol by fire, multiple streetcar lines were looped around the new park with large boarding platforms constructed on Griswold and Shelby streets, transforming it into a major transfer station. [...] In 1955, the Department of Street Railways (DSR) constructed the $280,000 Capitol <b>Park</b> <b>Bus</b> Terminal {{at the north end of}} the park which facilitated the moving of Stevens T. Mason's tomb to the south end of the park. [...] The new facility was constructed using steel and reinforced concrete, with plastic skylights throughout the concrete canopy. [...] Not long after the restructuring of the DSR as the Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT), the station was demolished in 1979, though the area around the park continued to be used as a major bus terminal.|$|E
