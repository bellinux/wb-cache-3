5|$|After <b>Poland</b> regained independence, provincial sejms were {{restored}} in the Second Polish Republic, {{although they were}} called sejms rather than sejmiks. They included the short-lived Sejm of Central Lithuania (1921–1922); the three voivodeship sejms (Silesian Parliament, Greater <b>Poland</b> Sejm, and Pomeranian Sejm, 1920–1939), which preserved the tradition of sejmiks in the former Prussian partition; and the county sejmiks, of which there were 264 in 1939. The existence of these institutions was interrupted by the occupation of <b>Poland</b> during the Second World War, {{and they were not}} reestablished in the era of communist <b>Poland.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{a request}} for {{assistance}} from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops. This prompted the League to decide {{that the future of}} Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in <b>Poland,</b> Lithuania, and the Soviet Union, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite. After unsuccessful proposals by Paul Hymans to create a federation between <b>Poland</b> and Lithuania, Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by <b>Poland</b> in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the Klaipėda Region, the Allied Conference set the frontier between Lithuania and <b>Poland,</b> leaving Vilnius within <b>Poland,</b> on 14 March 1923. Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with <b>Poland</b> until 1927. It was not until the 1938 Polish ultimatum that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with <b>Poland</b> and thus de facto accepted the borders.|$|E
5|$|After the Congress of Vienna, a small Kingdom of <b>Poland,</b> {{known as}} Congress <b>Poland,</b> was recreated, with its king being the Tsar of Russia, Alexander I. Alexander I, an enlightened autocrat, {{decided to use}} Congress <b>Poland</b> as an {{experiment}} to see if Russian autocratic rule could be mixed with an elective legislative system, and rule <b>Poland</b> as a constitutional monarchy. At that time many hoped that this experiment would be a success and pave way to a liberalization in Russia; {{in the end it}} proved to be a failure.|$|E
5000|$|On 15 January Standard & Poor's {{downgraded}} <b>Poland's</b> {{rating from}} A- to BBB+ because, {{according to a}} S&P spokesman, [...] "the downgrade reflects our view that <b>Poland's</b> system of institutional checks and balances has been eroded significantly. <b>Poland's</b> new government has initiated various legislative measures that we consider weaken the independence and effectiveness of key institutions, as reflected in our institutional assessment." [...] Fitch Ratings reaffirmed <b>Poland's</b> A- rating, stating that <b>Poland's</b> outlook was stable with [...] "strong macro performance, resilient banking system and governance indicators".|$|R

5|$|All of Sigismund's {{attempts}} {{to make peace with}} the sultan failed. He sent his envoys to Prague to negotiate with RudolphII, while his confessor, Carillo, started negotiations with Jan Zamoyski in <b>Poland.</b> At Sigismund's invitation, his cousin, Andrew Báthory, returned from <b>Poland.</b> Sigismund abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (now Mediaș in Romania) on 21March 1599. Eight days later, the Diet proclaimed Andrew Báthory prince, hoping that Andrew could make peace with the Ottomans with the assistance of <b>Poland.</b> Sigismund left Transylvania for <b>Poland</b> in June. His marriage with Maria Christierna was declared invalid in Rome in August.|$|E
5|$|Although for a {{few decades}} (since the times of the Silent Sejm) Russia had seen a weak <b>Poland</b> as its own protectorate, <b>Poland</b> had also been devastated by a civil war in which {{the forces of the}} Bar Confederation {{attempted}} to disrupt Russian control over <b>Poland.</b> The recent Koliyivschyna peasant and Cossack uprising in Ukraine also weakened Poland's position. Further, the Russian-supported Polish king, Stanisław August Poniatowski, was seen as both weak and too independent-minded; eventually the Russian court decided that the usefulness of <b>Poland</b> as a protectorate had diminished. The three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with a troublesome neighbor and restoring order in <b>Poland</b> through military intervention (the Bar Confederation provided a convenient excuse); in fact all three were interested in territorial gains.|$|E

According to Kazimierz Ujazdowski, a member of <b>Poland's</b> Sejm (parliament) and former Polish Minister of Culture, the eviction could have been prevented. Ujazdowski told <b>Poland's</b> Radio Maryja: [...] "The response of <b>Poland's</b> government was too late and too lackadaisical." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kultura {{played a}} major role in <b>Poland's</b> {{reconciliation}} with Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania, as the first independent Polish intellectual circle to openly advocate, in the 1950s, recognizing <b>Poland's</b> postwar eastern borders.

5|$|Built {{from its}} {{earliest}} nucleus outward, and having escaped {{much of the}} destruction endured by <b>Poland</b> during the 20th-century wars, Kraków's many architectural monuments can typically be seen in historical order by walking from the city centre out, towards its later districts.

He was the founder of the Polish Legions in Italy serving under Napoleon since 1797, and as a general in Italian and French service he contributed to the brief restoration of the Polish state during the Greater <b>Poland</b> Uprising of 1806. He participated in Napoleonic Wars, taking part in the Polish-Austrian war and the French invasion of Russia until 1813.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the features of <b>Poland’s</b> foreign policy.

The author describes the features of <b>Poland’s</b> foreign policy mechanism and emphasises its potential instability associated with a multi-tier decision-making pro­cedure and blurred boundaries between foreign policy mandates conferred by the Constitution upon the government and president. The latter creates a potential for institutional conflict. It is stressed that the efficiency of <b>Poland’s</b> foreign policy mechanism is strongly affected by the relations {{between the government and the}} president and requires consensus on all major foreign policy issues. The author em­phasises the effect of the domestic policy situation on Polish foreign policy mecha­nism and, as a result, the Republic’s stance in the international arena. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1830 {{a series}} of {{revolutions}} struck Europe: the July Revolution in France, the Belgian Revolution and smaller revolts in Italy threatened to overthrow the framework of European politics established at the Congress of Vienna. As the Russian tsars were among the strongest advocates of that status quo, the uprising in <b>Poland</b> and the ousting of the tsar as the king of <b>Poland</b> by the Sejm and Senate of <b>Poland</b> on 25 January 1831 were considered a serious irritant. Russia could not send its armies to Belgium or France before the rebellion in <b>Poland</b> was quelled. For that reason the capture of Warsaw was Russia's main target in the war {{from the start of}} hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Jogaila {{created a}} {{significant}} new {{alliance with the}} Kingdom of <b>Poland</b> when he secured an agreement, known as the Union of Krewo (August 1385), to marry the twelve-year-old King of <b>Poland</b> Jadwiga of <b>Poland.</b> He married Jadwiga and was crowned jure uxoris king of <b>Poland</b> in February 1386. As a condition to the marriage and coronation, Jogaila agreed to renounce paganism himself and Christianize his subjects, and establish a personal union between <b>Poland</b> and Lithuania. The Union was an unwelcome development for the Teutonic Knights, as it united <b>Poland</b> and Lithuania, two states hostile to the Order, and a Christianized Lithuania deprived the Knights of their ideological justification for waging the Lithuanian Crusade. Thus the Order sought opportunities to undo the Polish–Lithuanian union; they demanded Samogitia, a section of western Lithuania that bordered the Baltic Sea, and refused to recognize Jogaila's baptism in 1386.|$|E
