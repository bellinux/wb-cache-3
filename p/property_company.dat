40|$|The listed <b>property</b> <b>companies</b> {{are one of}} {{the real}} estate {{vehicles}} in Malaysian investment sector besides REITs and direct property investment. Although listed <b>property</b> <b>companies</b> {{play an important role in}} shaping Malaysian economy, the research on performance of Malaysian listed <b>property</b> <b>companies</b> has been modest in recent years notably after 1997 / 1998 Asian Financial Crisis (AFC). The objectives of the study are to determine the impact of Global Financial Crisis (GFC) on listed <b>property</b> <b>companies</b> and to assess the factors contributing to performance. This study provides descriptive and risk-adjusted analysis on the performance of 60 Malaysian listed <b>property</b> <b>companies</b> and factors using Dynamic Panel Regression Analysis from January 1999 till December 2012 to understand the impact of pre, during and post GFC. The results show that most companies experienced downturn during GFC period. However, they recovered fast in post GFC by gaining better Sharpe ratio, improved return and lower risk compared to their performance in pre GFC period. The econometric analysis using total return as dependent variable with 7 independent factors; GFC, market value, cash flow, dividend, intangible asset, total debt, and book value per share. The results revealed that only market value, book value per share and GFC factor have significant results in the Dynamic Panel Regression estimation model. With these findings, investors must aware that AFC and GFC reacts differently towards performance, hence <b>property</b> <b>companies</b> are able to use financial variables as guidelines in presenting their performance in future...|$|R

The bid failed, but prompted the LNC to secure the passing of the London Necropolis Act 1956, allowing the sale of all remaining surplus land. A new company, the Brookwood Estates Realisation Company, was founded to oversee the disposal of the remaining unsold lands as well as the cemetery reserve, finally formally recognising that Brookwood Cemetery would never expand beyond its original boundaries.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} was causing problems for the market, which required increasingly large lorries for deliveries and distribution. Redevelopment was considered, but protests from the Covent Garden Community Association in 1973 prompted the Home Secretary, Robert Carr, to give dozens of buildings around the square listed-building status, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market relocated to its new site, New Covent Garden Market, about three miles (5km) south-west at Nine Elms. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980, with cafes, pubs, small shops and a craft market called the Apple Market. Among the first shops to relocate here was Benjamin Pollock's Toy Shop. Another market, the Jubilee Market, is held in the Jubilee Hall {{on the south side of}} the square. The market halls and several other buildings in Covent Garden have been owned by the <b>property</b> <b>company</b> Capital & Counties Properties (CapCo) since 2006.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, Schweppes {{acquired}} from the Burrows family Pewtress Spring, in Colwall, {{on the western}} side of the Herefordshire Beacon, approximately two miles from Colwall village. The source here emerges at the fault line between the Silurian thrust and the Precambrian diorite and granite above it. The spring was renamed Primeswell Spring, and in 1929 Schweppes commenced bottling. The factory employed 25 people who filled 26 million bottles annually. It was operated by Coca-Cola Enterprises Ltd., and the water was sold under the Schweppes brand name. On 20 October 2010 Coca-Cola Enterprises, who owned the Malvern brand, announced that production would be ceasing as of 3 November 2010. This decision, which was widely criticised both in the town and beyond, was due to the declining market share Malvern has on the overall water market. On 28 October 2011, it was reported that the bottling plant is being sold to a <b>property</b> <b>company.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Imperial War Museum North {{was opened}} in Trafford, Greater Manchester in 2002.

Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, Imperial War Museum North was his first building in Britain. Libeskind’s building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays, was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape. Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings, a local transport and <b>property</b> <b>company</b> which contributed £12.5 million.|$|E
5|$|The Mall was {{initially}} a huge success, but its popularity declined as new retail outlets in Little Rock drew customers away.

Due to the waning popularity and litigation involving the deterioration of the building, the mall was sold in 2007 to Strode <b>Property</b> <b>Company,</b> and the remaining few tenants were told to vacate. Demolition began for the primary structure in early 2008.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the dynamics of}} return and dynamic volatility across the Malaysian and pan-Asian countries’ listed <b>property</b> <b>companies</b> market over the period January 1998 to August 2012.

This paper uses ARCH and GARCH models to empirically examine the dynamic volatility of listed <b>property</b> <b>companies</b> in 12 pan-Asian countries.

He began his club football career with CE Mataró before being signed for Barcelona's La Masia youth academy aged ten in 1997. His first coach, Señor Blai, reportedly did not select Fàbregas for matches against Barcelona in an attempt to hide him from their scouts. This tactic, however, was unable to withstand Barcelona for long, and Mataró gave in and allowed Fàbregas to train with Barcelona one day per week. Eventually Fàbregas joined Barcelona's academy full-time. His initial training was as a defensive midfielder playing alongside notable names such as Gerard Piqué and Lionel Messi. Although he was a prolific scorer, sometimes scoring even more than 30 goals in a season for the club's youth teams, he did not manage to play a first team game at the Camp Nou. During his time at Barcelona's youth academy, Fàbregas idolised Barcelona's then-captain and number four Pep Guardiola, who would later give Fàbregas his shirt as consolation when Fàbregas' parents divorced.|$|E
