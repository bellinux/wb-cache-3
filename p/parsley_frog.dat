40|$|Abstract Spadefoot toads (Pelobates) and <b>Parsley</b> <b>frogs</b> (Pelodytes) are {{an enigmatic}} group of Western Palaearctic anurans. In the genus Pelobates, a fossorial {{lifestyle}} has enforced a conserved bauplan that masks their intraspecific evolutionary history. We used partial sequences of the mitochondrial 16 S and 12 S rRNA genes to infer a paleobiogeographic scenario of speciation events {{in these two}} anuran genera. Based on two alternative, mutually exclusive calibrations of the Iberian-African split within Pelobates (Pb. cultripes and Pb. varaldii), the disjunction of the Betic Cordillera ca. 14 - 16 million years ago (mya), {{and the end of}} the Messinian Salinity crisis 5. 33 mya, we inferred alternative scenarios for species evolution within both genera applying regression-based dating and Bayesian molecular dating. Pelobates and Pelodytes are both monophyletic genera. Interspecific relationships among spadefoot toads are poorly resolved, and only an Iberian-African Pb. cultripes/Pb. varaldii clade consistently emerges from our analyses. An evolutionary scenario based on the Messinian divergence of African and Iberian Pelobates lineages becomes plausible in the light of geological and paleontological data. Consequently, Pelobates species are likely to have originated from the Miocene. Speciation around the Oligocene/Miocene boundary is inferred for the Iberian-Caucasian Pelodytes, and a Messinian divergence has to be invoked to explain intraspecific diversification of Iberian <b>parsley</b> <b>frogs.</b> There is indication that the different Pb. syriacus lineages may not form a monophylum...|$|R

40|$|Species {{delineation}} is {{a central}} topic in evolutionary biology, with current efforts focused on developing efficient analytical tools to extract the most information from molecular data and provide objective and repeatable results. In this paper we use a multilocus dataset (mtDNA and two nuclear markers) in a geographically comprehensive population sample across Iberia and Western Europe to delineate candidate species in a morphologically cryptic species group, <b>Parsley</b> <b>frogs</b> (genus Pelodytes). Pelodytes is the sole extant representative of an ancient, historically widely distributed anuran clade that currently includes three species: P. caucasicus in the Caucasus; P. punctatus in Western Europe, from Portugal to North-Western Italy; and P. ibericus in Southern Iberia. Phylogenetic analyses recovered four major well-supported haplotype clades in Western Europe, corresponding to well demarcated geographical subdivisions and exhibiting contrasting demographic histories. Splitting times {{date back to the}} Plio-Pleistocene and are very close in time. Species-tree analyses recovered one of these species lineages, corresponding to P. ibericus (lineage B)., as the sister taxon to the other three major species lineages, distributed respectively in: western Iberian Peninsula, along the Atlantic coast and part of central Portugal (lineage A); Central and Eastern Spain (lineage C); and North-eastern Spain, France and North-western Italy (lineage D). The latter is in turn subdivided into two sub-clades, one in SE France and NW Italy and the other one from NE Spain to NW France, suggesting the existence of a Mediterranean-Atlantic corridor along the Garonne river. An information theory-based validation approach implemented in SpedeSTEM supports an arrangement of four candidate species, suggesting the need for a taxonomic revision of Western European Pelodytes.

5000|$|The parsley frogs or Pelodytidae are {{a family}} of order Anura. The family {{consists}} of just one genus, Pelodytes, which contains only three species. These frogs {{can be found in}} southwestern Europe and the Caucasus. The common name of [...] "parsley frogs" [...] comes from the common <b>parsley</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelodytes punctatus) which, because of its colouring, looks garnished with parsley.|$|E
50|$|Adult Iberian parsley frogs {{attain a}} length of about 4 cm and look {{very similar to the}} common <b>parsley</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelodytes punctatus, its sister species) but are a little smaller with shorter limbs. The skin is smooth or {{granular}} with a scattering of dark-coloured tubercles. The dorsal surface varies from olive, greenish-brown, dark brown or greenish-grey and is flecked with green specks. The undersurface is white or cream and the throat of breeding males is dark-coloured.|$|E
5000|$|In France, the {{breeding}} season lasts {{from the end}} of February to early April; in Portugal, it is from November to March. In Andalusia, this <b>parsley</b> <b>frog</b> may spawn several times a year. For laying places, it prefers weedy ponds and sometimes streams. The males create a relatively quiet croaking noise with the help of their paired inner vocal sacs, under water.

50|$|The common <b>parsley</b> <b>frog</b> (Pelodytes punctatus) is a {{very small}} and slender frog with long hindlegs, flat head and {{vertical}} pupils. Males reach only 3.5, females 4.5 centimetres. The upper side of the body is variable in colour, usually with irregular green patches on a light brown, grey or light olive background. The frog's back is dotted with elongated warts, often in undulating longitudinal rows that can be orange along the flanks. Behind the protruding eyes and above the tympanum, there is short, small gland. It does not have parotid glands. The underside is white, and around the pelvis yellowy orange.

The Colchian rain forests are mixed, with deciduous black alder (Alnus glutinosa), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus and C. orientalis), Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), and sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) together with evergreen Nordmann fir (Abies nordmanniana, the tallest tree in Europe at 78 m), Caucasian spruce (Picea orientalis) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris).The refugium is the largest throughout the Western Asian / near Eastern region. The area has multiple representatives of disjunct relict groups of plants with the closest relatives in Eastern Asia, southern Europe, and even North America. Over 70 species of forest snails of the region are endemic. Some relict species of vertebrates are Caucasian <b>parsley</b> <b>frog,</b> Caucasian salamander, Robert's snow vole and Caucasian grouse; they are almost entirely endemic groups of animals such as lizards of genus Darevskia. In general, species composition of this refugium is quite distinct and differs from that of the other Western Eurasian refugia. Genetic data suggest that the Colchis temperate rainforest, during the Ice Age, was fragmented into smaller parts; in particular, evolutionary lineages of the Caucasian Salamander from the central and south-western Colchis remained isolated from one another during the entire Ice Age.|$|E

Populations appeared isolated and made up of an extremely low number of reproductive females (range 2 - 19. mean 9). In Italy. /'. punctatus populations show a fragmented distribution and appear threatened mainly by the drying up of pools or habitat destruction. For each reproductive site, the conservation status was evaluated, and a general conservation strategy was proposed.
