Japanese deep-fried dishes, or Agemono, include other styles besides tempura, such as Karaage, Korokke, Kushikatsu, and Tonkatsu. In areas of south-east Asia such as Thailand, insects are commonly deep-fried for human consumption. Western-style fast food items such as donuts, deep-fried chicken, and deep-fried <b>potatoes</b> <b>are</b> also becoming popular in Asia.|$|E

For decades, there has been significant disagreement between traditionalists and innovators regarding which ingredients should {{and should not be}} included in a salade niçoise. According to traditionalists, it excludes cooked vegetables. The salad may include raw red peppers, shallots, artichoke hearts and other seasonal raw vegetables. Raw green beans harvested in the spring, when they are still young and crisp, may be included. However, cooked green beans and <b>potatoes</b> <b>are</b> commonly served in variations of salade niçoise that are popular around the world.|$|E

5|$|The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans {{recommends}} consuming five to nine {{servings of}} fruit and vegetables daily.

5000|$|Potatoes: <b>Potatoes</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} to Europe from Latin America.

50|$|The {{situation}} {{was very different}} for the poor, who made up 75% {{of the population of}} around nine million by 1840. Potatoes form the basis for many Irish dishes and indeed were eaten both by the Anglo-Irish gentry and the mass of the people.

The <b>potato</b> <b>was</b> first introduced into Ireland {{in the second half of}} the 16th century, initially as a garden crop. It eventually came to be the main food crop of the poor. As a food source, the <b>potato</b> <b>is</b> extremely valuable in terms of the amount of energy produced per unit area of crop. The <b>potato</b> <b>is</b> also a good source of many vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin C when fresh. <b>Potatoes</b> <b>were</b> widely cultivated, but in particular by those at a subsistence level; the diet of this group of this period consisted mainly of potatoes supplemented with buttermilk.|$|R

25|$|They grow well in many farming {{conditions}} and have few natural enemies; pesticides are rarely needed. Sweet <b>potatoes</b> <b>are</b> grown {{on a variety}} of soils, but well-drained, light- and medium-textured soils with a pH range of 4.5-7.0 are more favorable for the plant. They can be grown in poor soils with little fertilizer. However, sweet <b>potatoes</b> <b>are</b> very sensitive to aluminum toxicity and will die about six weeks after planting if lime is not applied at planting in this type of soil. Because they are sown by vine cuttings rather than seeds, sweet <b>potatoes</b> <b>are</b> relatively easy to plant. Because the rapidly growing vines shade out weeds, little weeding is needed. A commonly used herbicide to rid the soil of any unwelcome plants that may interfere with growth is DCPA, also known as Dacthal. In the tropics, the crop can be maintained in the ground and harvested as needed for market or home consumption. In temperate regions, sweet <b>potatoes</b> <b>are</b> most often grown on larger farms and are harvested before first frosts.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, <b>potato</b> <b>is</b> an {{extensively}} cultivated {{annual crop}} in Bangladesh showing higher productivity (16.68 t/ha versus that of maize at 4.97 t/ha) with shorter harvesting period (90  days for potato compared to 140  days for maize). As a result, {{the cost of}} <b>potato</b> <b>is</b> significantly lower (four times lower than corn) in Bangladesh [10, 11]. The production of <b>potato</b> <b>is</b> surplus in Bangladesh, and several tons of unused <b>potato</b> <b>are</b> dumped each year due to insufficient storage facilities. It would greatly benefit the potato farmers if <b>potato</b> could <b>be</b> used in poultry ration. It is worthy to note that 90 % of corn is being imported into Bangladesh. This also leads to serious adverse effects on nation’s gross domestic product (GDP).
