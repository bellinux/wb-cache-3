The subject is examined from both a theoretical and a practical perspective. In an empirical study, the <b>product</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>information</b> model of an automotive firm is mapped out and issues perceived as challenging by the firm identified. A comparison of the theoretical configuration models and practical models is presented.

Knowledge-based configurations can be classified into three different approaches, namely rule-based, model-based, and case-based approaches.

Previous attempts to automate <b>product</b> <b>configurations</b> concentrate on representations {{and management of the}} knowledge for specific domains in fixed and isolated computing environments. Since the knowledge about <b>product</b> <b>configurations</b> is subject to continuous change and hard to express, these attempts often failed to efficiently manage and exchange the knowledge in collaborative product development. In this paper, XML Topic Map (XTM) is introduced to represent and exchange the knowledge about <b>product</b> <b>configurations</b> in collaborative <b>product</b> development.

40|$|<b>Product</b> <b>configuration</b> {{software}} tools are commonly available as stand-alone products or {{as part of}} standard enterprise software. The application of product configurators generally addresses three goals: <b>Product</b> <b>configuration</b> tools support sales activities, they support different tasks of process planning, e. g. automated generation of Bills Of Material and they preserve engineering knowledge by storing configuration rules or cases systematically. The customer-driven <b>product</b> <b>configuration</b> of complex machinery usually affects several suppliers who consequently have to adjust their respective modules. The subsequently necessary coordination process between OEM and suppliers is both costly and time-consuming, accounting for a big fraction of the total time of delivery.

This will enable the firms to capitalize on the reuse philosophy in order to survive and strive in a difficult market. There are many commercial enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems for <b>product</b> <b>configuration,</b> in particular for electrical and mechanical component managements. However, these ERP <b>product</b> <b>configuration</b> systems often are expensive to acquire, customize, and maintain. An in-house custom-built <b>product</b> <b>configuration</b> system utilizing open-source code and freeware may be the answer for the companies that are eager to cut down the budget and make their products more profitable. In addition, a custom program that takes advantage of the flexibility, efficiency, and platform independent features of Java, J 2 EE, XML, SVG and Java 2 D Graphics adds the potential reuse and extendible functions to accommodate future requirements of incorporating other applications to become a complete <b>product</b> <b>configuration</b> package. This project discusses the current problems with <b>product</b> <b>configuration</b> that large-sized engineering companies specializing in customized products have encountered, the mass customization theory, and how a custom <b>product</b> <b>configuration</b> system can make mass customization work for these large-sized engineering companies with continuous process enhancements.

However, it is costly to fix the problem if the quality attributes have not been considered in the <b>product</b> <b>configuration</b> stage.

In order to measure the impact of industrial process fluctuations on the product performances, {{the construction of a}} failure risk probability estimator is presented in this article. The complex relationship between the process technology and the product design (non linearities, multi-modal features [...] .) is handled via random process regression. A random field encodes, for each <b>product</b> <b>configuration,</b> the available <b>information</b> regarding the risk of non-compliance. After a brief presentation of the Gaussian model approach, we describe a Bayesian reasoning avoiding a priori choices of location and scale parameters.

The probabilistic nature of the model is then operated to derive a failure risk probability, defined as a random variable. To do this, our approach is to consider as random all unknown, inaccessible or fluctuating data. In order to propagate uncertainties, a fuzzy set approach provides an appropriate framework for the implementation of a Bayesian model mimicking expert elicitation. The underlying leitmotiv is to insert minimal a priori information in the failure risk model. The relevancy of this concept is illustrated with theoretical examples.
