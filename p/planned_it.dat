5|$|Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville, Maryland, {{bears his}} name, itself {{located in the}} county named after him Montgomery County. Montgomery Place, a mansion in Barrytown, New York, was {{constructed}} in 1803 and named in his honor by his widow. General Montgomery had <b>planned</b> <b>it</b> before his departure from Grassmere in 1775, and construction was originally planned to start in 1776.|$|E
5|$|A mobile racing game {{based on}} a mini game from VII, Final Fantasy VII G-Bike, was {{released}} on October 30, 2014, for iOS and Android. A western release for the title was <b>planned.</b> <b>It</b> was developed by Japan-based developer CyberConnect2 {{as part of a}} planned subseries of mobile games based on VIIs mini games. While related to VII and the Compilation due to its nature, the developers confirmed that it was not related to nor affected the Compilation itself. Due to difficulties delivering continual satisfactory service, G-Bike was shut down in 2015 without seeing a Western release.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Fremantle Prison {{came under}} local control in 1886, a {{refractory}} block with gallows was <b>planned.</b> <b>It</b> {{was completed in}} 1888, and first used in 1889 to execute a convicted murderer, Jimmy Long, a Malayan. The gallows room was the only lawful place of execution in Western Australia between 1888 and 1984. At least 43 men and one woman were hanged in this period. Martha Rendell {{was the only woman}} to be hanged at the prison, in 1909. The last person to be hanged was serial killer Eric Edgar Cooke, executed in 1964.|$|E

5|$|The station {{opened in}} 1899 as the London {{terminus}} of the Great Central Main Line (GCML), {{the last major}} railway to open in Britain in over 100 years, linking the capital to the cities of Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester. Marylebone {{was the last of}} London's main line termini to be built, {{and is one of the}} smallest, having opened with half the number of platforms originally <b>planned.</b> <b>It</b> has limited connections to the Underground as it was built after the main Tube lines in the area.|$|E
5|$|Though the German {{advance in}} the south was slower than <b>planned,</b> <b>it</b> was faster than the Soviets expected. On 9 July, the first German units reached the Psel River. The next day, the first German {{infantry}} crossed the river. Despite the deep defensive system and minefields, German tank losses remained lower than the Soviet's. At this point, Hoth turned the II SS Panzer Corps away from Oboyan to attack toward the northeast {{in the direction of}} Prokhorovka. The main concern of Manstein and Hausser was the inability of Army Detachment Kempf to advance and protect the eastern flank of the II SS Panzer Corps. On 11 July, Army Detachment Kempf finally achieved a breakthrough. In a surprise night attack, the 6th Panzer Division seized a bridge across the Donets. Once across, Breith made every effort to push troops and vehicles across the river for an advance on Prokhorovka from the south. A linkup with the II SS Panzer Corps would result with the Soviet 69th Army becoming encircled.|$|E
5|$|When AirTrain JFK {{was being}} <b>planned,</b> <b>it</b> was {{expected}} that 11,000 passengers per day would pay to ride the system between the airport and either Howard Beach or Jamaica, while 23,000 more daily passengers would use the AirTrain to travel between terminals. This would amount to about 4 million paid passengers and 8.4 million in-airport passengers per year. The system would cause a reduction of approximately 75,000 vehicle miles driven per day, as well as accommodate over 3,000 daily riders from Manhattan, according to the FEIS. During {{the first month of}} service, an average of 15,000 daily passengers rode either the paid or unpaid sections of the system, less than the 34,000 expected daily riders. This made it the second-busiest airport transportation system in the United States, even though it had been open for only a month. Since then, ridership continued to rise. AirTrain JFK transported 1 million riders within its first six months.|$|E

25|$|In February 1832, Sébastiani took {{initiative}} in ordering a French occupation of Ancona.
