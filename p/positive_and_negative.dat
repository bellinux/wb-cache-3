5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix of <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> {{in the case of}} a global alignment, but must be both <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative,</b> {{in the case of a}} local alignment.|$|E

5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E

5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once {{they reach the}} limit of their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment of <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the four}} {{fundamental}} interactions, gravitation is dominant at cosmological length scales, including galaxies and larger-scale structures. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, {{the effects of}} <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on cosmological length scales. The remaining two interactions, the weak and strong nuclear forces, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia {{is often}} {{described}} in terms of <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.|$|E
5|$|The commonness and {{centrality}} {{of wine in}} daily life in biblical times is apparent from its many <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> metaphorical uses throughout the Bible.

Negatively, wine is personified as a mocker and beer a brawler, and drinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgment and wrath.|$|E

40|$|This letter {{explains}} that density of <b>positive</b> mass <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> mass is almost uniformly {{throughout the whole}} universe, but density of <b>positive</b> mass <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> mass included in a random universe radius R can be different from each other. Like this, positive, zero, negative values of total gravitational potential energy are all possible due to density difference of <b>positive</b> mass <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> mass included in a random universe radius R. This letter is showing possibility in explaining the decelerating expansion and accelerating expansion due to density difference of <b>positive</b> mass <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> mass because <b>negative</b> mass <b>and</b> <b>positive</b> mass conducts different forms of movement depending on the density difference of <b>positive</b> mass <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> mass. As change of total gravitational potential energy sign occurs from UT= 0 and total gravitational potential energy oscillates based on 0.

40|$|A {{basic problem}} of {{microarray}} data analysis {{is to identify}} genes whose expression {{is affected by the}} distinction between malignancies with different properties. These genes are said to be differentially expressed. Differential expression can be detected by selecting the genes with P-values (derived using an appropriate hypothesis test) below a certain rejection level. This selection, however, is not possible without accepting some false <b>positives</b> <b>and</b> <b>negatives</b> since the two sets of P-values, associated with the genes whose expression is and is not affected by the distinction between the different malignancies, overlap. We describe a procedure for the study of differential expression in microarray data based on receiver-operating characteristic curves. This approach can be useful to select a rejection level that balances the number of false <b>positives</b> <b>and</b> <b>negatives</b> <b>and</b> to assess the degree of overlap between the two sets of P-values. Since this degree of overlap characterises the balance that can be reached between the number of false <b>positives</b> <b>and</b> <b>negatives,</b> this quantity {{can be seen as a}} quality measure of microarray data with respect to the detection of differential expression. As an example, we apply our method to data sets studying acute leukaemia. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The {{strength}} {{and range of}} the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities of <b>positive</b> <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> charges in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a non-neutral plasma. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged particle beams, an electron cloud in a Penning trap and positron plasmas.|$|E
