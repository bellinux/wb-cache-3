40|$|Orientational {{correlation}} functions {{have been}} obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of long, freely jointed chains (1000 monomers and more) with screened Coulomb interactions truncated after {{a certain number of}} bonds. This makes it possible to study chain-length dependence without "end effects" and to display excluded-volume effects. These correlation functions form the basis {{for a discussion of the}} conformational response to electrostatic interactions. In particular, they are related to the concept of electrostatic persistence length and the correlation functions illustrate the differences between different definitions of persistence length. To facilitate future discussions, we have identified four types of definitions and given them separate names: (1.) <b>projection</b> <b>length,</b> which involves: integration of the orientational correlation function; (2) orientational correlation length, which is the decay length of an exponential function; (3) bending coefficient, which is a length representing a bending force constant; and (4) crossover distance, which is the monomer-monomer distance at the boundary between a rodlike and a swollen behavior. Previous conclusions that the <b>projection</b> <b>length</b> obeys a power law at high salt concentrations, while the orientational correlation length does not, are confirmed. Furthermore, a power law is also found in the salt-free limit for the <b>projection</b> <b>length</b> corresponding to an infinite chain with a finite range of interactions. The two power laws make it possible to construct a universal curve that gives an almost quantitative description of the chain behavior...|$|E

Previously, we have developed two algorithms to reconstruct 3 -D blood vessels from stereoscopic MRA. The assumption we made was that blood vessels were tilting circular tubes and {{the shape of the}} vessel on every cross-section was an ellipse. Since an ellipse can be represented in either algebraic form or parametric form, our previous algorithms reconstructed the ellipses by representing them in these two forms. In this paper, we further improved the accuracy of our previous algorithms by an order through two enhancements. The first improvement we made was a better method to estimate the rotation angle of the major axis of an ellipse. Instead of using the center of two adjacent ellipses to estimate the rotation angle as in our previous method, the new method used the <b>projection</b> <b>lengths</b> of the two views to estimate the angle. The second improvement we made was the equation to describe the relationship between the major/minor axes and the <b>projection</b> <b>lengths.</b> In our experiments, the average estimation error for the parametric algorithm was improved from 0. 471 pixels to 0. 066 pixels.

Data from 104, 035 loblolly pine and 37, 515 slash pine individual tree observations collected on a 3 -year cycle from 174 loblolly pine and 80 slash pine permanent plots located in plantations throughout East Texas were used in this study.

Predictions were evaluated in terms of bias and precision, with independent observations for projection lengths from 3 to 24 years.

For survival, bias increased and precision decreased as <b>projection</b> <b>length</b> increased through 24 years.

40|$|Organized {{motility}} {{patterns in}} the gut depend on circuitry within the enteric nervous system (ENS), but {{little is known about}} the development of electrophysiological properties and synapses within the ENS. We examined the electrophysiology and morphology of myenteric neurons in the mouse duodenum at three developmental stages: postnatal day (P) 0, P 10 – 11, and adult. Like adults, two main classes of neurons could be identified at P 0 and P 10 – 11 based on morphology: neurons with multiple long processes that projected circumferentially (Dogiel type II morphology) and neurons with a single long process. However, postnatal Dogiel type II neurons differed in several electrophysiological properties from adult Dogiel type II neurons. P 0 and P 10 – 11 Dogiel type II neurons exhibited very prominent Ca(2 +) -mediated after depolarizing potentials (ADPs) following action potentials compared to adult neurons. Adult Dogiel type II neurons are characterized by the presence of a prolonged after hyperpolarizing potential (AHP), but AHPs were very rarely observed at P 0. The <b>projection</b> <b>lengths</b> of the long processes of Dogiel type II neurons were mature by P 10 – 11. Uniaxonal neurons in adults typically have fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs, ‘S-type' electrophysiology) mainly mediated by nicotinic receptors. Nicotinic-fEPSPs were also recorded from neurons with a single long process at P 0 and P 10 – 11. However, these neurons underwent major developmental changes in morphology, from predominantly filamentous neurites at birth to lamellar dendrites in mature mice. Unlike Dogiel type II neurons, the <b>projection</b> <b>lengths</b> of neurons with a single long process matured after P 10 – 11. Slow EPSPs were rarely observed in P 0 /P 10 – 11 neurons.

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for image {{magnification}} by exploiting the property that {{the intensity of}} an image varies along {{the direction of the}} gradient very quickly. It aims to maintain sharp edges and clear details. The proposed method first calculates the gradient of the low-resolution image by fitting a surface with quadratic polynomial precision. Then, bicubic interpolation is used to obtain initial gradients of the high-resolution (HR) image. The initial gradients are readjusted to find the constrained gradients of the HR image, according to spatial correlations between gradients within a local window. To generate an HR image with high precision, a linear surface weighted by the <b>projection</b> <b>length</b> in the gradient direction is constructed. Each pixel in the HR image is determined by the linear surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our method visually improves the quality of the magnified image.

Our analysis predicts that the behavior at large pipette radii or small elastic area expansivity is close to the one predicted by the basic liquid-drop model, where the critical point is attained slightly before the <b>projection</b> <b>length</b> reaches the pipette radius.

In isolated, intact, whole colonic preparations, simultaneous intracellular electrical recordings were made from pairs of circular muscle (CM) cells during colonic MMC activity {{in the presence of}} nifedipine (1 – 2 μm). During the intervals between colonic MMCs, spontaneous inhibitory junction potentials (IJPs) were always present. The amplitudes of spontaneous IJPs were highly variable (range 1 – 20 mV) and occurred asynchronously in the two CM cells, when separated by 1 mm in the longitudinal axis. Colonic MMCs occurred every 151 ± 7 s in the CM and consisted of a repetitive discharge of cholinergic rapid oscillations in membrane potential (range: 1 – 20 mV) that were superimposed on a slow membrane depolarization (mean amplitude: 9. 6 ± 0. 5 mV; half-duration: 25. 9 ± 0. 7 s). During the rising (depolarizing) phase of each colonic MMC, cholinergic rapid oscillations occurred simultaneously in both CM cells, even when the two electrodes were separated by up to 15 mm along the longitudinal axis of the colon. Smaller amplitude oscillations (< 5 mV) showed poor temporal correlation between two CM cells, even at short electrode separation distances (i. e. < 1 mm in the longitudinal axis). When the two electrodes were separated by 20 mm, all cholinergic rapid oscillations and IJPs in the CM (regardless of amplitude) were rarely, if ever, coordinated in time during the colonic MMC. Cholinergic rapid oscillations were blocked by atropine (1 μm) or tetrodotoxin (1 μm). Slow waves were never recorded from any CM cells. DiI labelling showed that the maximum <b>projection</b> <b>length</b> of CM motor neurones and interneurones along the bowel was 2. 8 mm and 13 mm, respectively. When recordings were made adjacent to either oral or anal cut ends of the colon, the inhibitory or excitatory phases of the colonic MMC were absent, respectively. In summary, during the colonic MMC, cholinergic rapid oscillations of similar amplitudes occur simultaneously in two CM cells separated by large distances (up to 15 mm). As this distance was found to be far greater than the <b>projection</b> <b>length</b> of any single CM motor neurone, we suggest that the generation of each discrete cholinergic rapid oscillation represents a discreet cholinergic excitatory junction potential (EJP) that involves the synaptic activation of many cholinergic motor neurones simultaneously, by synchronous firing in many myenteric interneurones.
