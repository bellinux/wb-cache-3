40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Idiopathic scoliosis is a 3 -dimensional spine deformity affecting 0. 3 – 0. 5 % of children younger than 16 years of age [1, 2]. Bracing is frequently prescribed as a non-surgical treatment option to patients with idiopathic scoliosis and a spinal curvature greater than 20 ° Cobb. Notably, bracing is the only conservative approach with proven effective-ness in such condition [3 - 8]. Several factors may have influence the efficacy of brace treatment, including age, gender, bone maturity, <b>prescribed</b> <b>hours</b> of bracing, and curve pattern and magnitude. In particular, a recent Cochrane Review [9 - 11] and a meta-analysis by Rowe [12] have shown that compliance has a great impact on the outcome of bracing.

We hypothesized that adolescents might play more often and respond better than adults to training using a game-like laptop in their home environment. Methods [...] Youth 10 - 19 years with Early Onset Psychosis (EOP) were provided a laptop and randomly assigned to play games to enhance basic auditory, visual and social processing neuroplasticity games (NPG) or assigned to control games with cognitive components, such as Sudoku or hangman or (CG). All received neurocognitive assessments at baseline, intervention completion and 4 months post treatment. Results — 12 youth (15. 5 + 3. 2 yrs) were assigned to NPG and 10 participants (16. 2 + 2. 1 years) were assigned to CG. More NPG than CG participants completed the <b>prescribed</b> <b>hours</b> of game play (block 1 - 92 % vs. 70 % over the first 40 hours), with both groups engaged less over time. Although most neurocognitive functions did not change, the NPG group did show improvements in WRAML Visual Learning, WISC Digit Span Forward, Spatial Span Backwards and CPT omission errors. Surprisingly, satisfaction was lower for NPG than CG. Conclusions — Groups were well matched for baseline illness characteristics. On the global measures of cognition, both EOP groups showed improvement over time but those improvements were generally greater in the CG than in the NPG group, with potentially significant differences favoring the CG evident in the neurocognitive composite score (p= 0. 072) and BRIEF metacognition (p=. 117).

2500|$|Chakraverti {{was born}} on 3 November 1950, to diplomat Debabrata Chakraverti, and Roma Sen, a {{descendant}} of the royals. Chakraverti {{spent much of her}} early life in Montreal, Canada, where her father was stationed. He was a representative from India to the Council of ICAO. An only child, she shared her father's passion for reading and devoured books on Indian mysticism and traditions partly because people at Montreal were always asking questions about India. In 1965, while on vacation in the Laurentian mountains, Chakraverti was invited to an all woman's party by one of her mother's friends, Carlotta. There, she was introduced to the Society for the Study of Ancient Cultures and Civilizations, founded [...] by Carlotta. The group studied ancient texts, long-forgotten customs and the mystical way of life. Chakraverti was selected to join the group, through a process of initiation, and enrolled for a course with them. For the next five years, she stayed in a chalet on the mountains and studied ancient cultures and their long-forgotten rituals with eleven other women, with Carlotta as their teacher. Alcohol, close friendship or anything that distracted them from the <b>prescribed</b> <b>hours</b> of study, solitude and meditation, were taboo. Practical training in witchcraft was the only way; it included learning varied techniques of self-development and understanding the significance of ancient chants, movements, symbols, gestures, invoking energy from the elements, and training {{in the use of the}} apparatus integral to the craft. Chakraverti later commented, [...] "It started as an academic curiosity. [...] Wicca includes both scientific facts and old lore. We studied Carl Jung and Friedrich Nietzsche because Wicca means studying various layers of the human mind." [...] In 1972, near the completion of their course, Chakraverti, along with two other women were asked to choose between Way of Tao, Wicca and Kabbalah as their practiced craft; Chakraverti chose Wicca. She later commented that ancient goddesses like Isis, Artemis, Hecate, Kali and Freya, played an important role in deciding her future in Wicca.|$|R

40|$|President’s Message Hello fellow AITPM members, Well I can’t believe it’s already October! My {{office is}} already organising its end of year {{function}} and looking {{to plan for}} 2010. Our whole School is moving to a different building next year, with the lovely L block eventually making way for a new shiny one. Those {{of you who have}} entered the Brisbane CBD from the south side, across the Captain Cook Bridge, would know L block as the big 9 storey brick and concrete Lego block ode to 1970 ’s functional architecture, which greets you on the right hand side. Onto traffic matters: an issue that has been tossing around in my mind of late is that of speed. I know I am growing older and may be prematurely becoming a “grumpy old man”, but everyone around me locally seems to be accelerating off from the stop line much faster than I was taught to for economical driving, both here and in the United States (yes they made my wife and me resit our written and practical driving tests when we lived there). People here in Australia also seem to be driving right on top of the posted speed limit, on whichever part of the Road Hierarchy, whether urban or rural. I was also taught {{on both sides of the}} planet that the posted speed limit is a maximum legal speed, not the recommended driving speed. This message did seem to sink in to the American drivers around me when we lived in Oregon - where people did appear to drive more cautiously. Further, posted speed limits in Oregon were, and I presume still are, set more conservative by about 5 mph or 10 km/h than Australian limits, for any given part of the Road Hierarchy. Another excellent speed limit treatment used in Oregon was in school zones, where reduced speed limits applied “when children are present” rather than during <b>prescribed</b> <b>hours</b> on school days. This would be especially useful here in Australia, where a lot of extra-curricular activities take place around schools outside of the <b>prescribed</b> speed limit <b>hours.</b> Before and after hours school care is on the increase (with parents dropping and collecting children near dawn and dusk in the winter), and many childcentred land uses are located adjacent to schools, such as Scouts/Guides halls, swimming pools and parks. Consequentially, I believe there needs to be some consideration towards more public campaigning about economical driving and the real purpose of the speed limit = or perhaps even a rethink of the speed limit concept, if people really are driving on top of it and it’s not just me becoming grumpier (our industrial psychology friends at the research centres may be able to assist us here).

40|$|Bacteremia is a {{life-threatening}} condition for which antibiotics must be <b>prescribed</b> within <b>hours</b> of clinical diagnosis. Since the current {{gold standard for}} bacteremia diagnosis is based on conventional methods developed in the mid- 1800 s - growth on agar or in broth - identification and susceptibility profiling for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species requires at least 48 - 72 h. Recent advancements in accelerated phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing have centered on the microscopic growth analysis of small bacterial populations. These approaches are still inherently limited by the bacterial growth rate. Our approach is fundamentally different. By applying environmental stress to bacteria in a microfluidic platform, we can correctly assign antibiotic susceptibility profiles of clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria within two hours of antibiotic introduction rather than 8 - 24 h. The substantial expansion to include a number of clinical isolates of important Gram-negative species - Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa - reported here underscores the broad utility of our approach, complementing the method's proven utility for Gram-positive bacteria. We also demonstrate that the platform is compatible with antibiotics that have varying mechanisms of action - meropenem, gentamicin, and ceftazidime - highlighting the versatility of this platform...|$|R
40|$|Background & Aim: Restrictive {{antibiotics}} prescribing {{in primary}} care during office hours may lead to increased workload after hours. Therefore, we studied {{the extent to which}} patients with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) who consulted their GP and did not get an antibiotics prescription contacted the out-of-hours services afterwards, within the same disease episode. In addition, we studied whether restrictive <b>prescribing</b> during office <b>hours</b> can explain the GP practice variation in out-of-hours consultations for URTI. Method: Patient level data from electronic health records from general practitioners were linked to data from electronic health records of the primary out-of-hours services (OOH) participating in the NIVEL Primary Care Database. This yielded linked data on 417, 041 patients from 102 GP practices and 18 out-of-hours services in the Netherlands of whom 38, 579 patients (12, 266 0 - 12 year olds and 26, 313 aged 13 years or older) had at least one episode of URTI in 2013. Results: Preliminary analyses showed that 3. 4 % of the 0 - 12 year olds who consulted their GP during office hours also contacted an OOH within the same disease episode. Whether or not the GP prescribed antibiotics did not make a difference (4. 3 % vs 3. 1 %). Almost 1 % of URTI patients ¬> 13 contacted the OOH after consulting a GP during day care. Again, {{there was no difference between}} patients with and without antibiotics prescriptions during office hours (0. 9 % vs 0. 8 %).
