40|$|Current aminosalicylic acid (ASA) {{preparations}} {{are used}} to induce and control the remission of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBOs); however, only partial success has been achi~ved. Hence, {{in the absence of}} a satisfactor~ treatment or a cure, there is a need for the development of further therapeutic strategies to combat IBOs. The objective of this study was to explore new therapeutic avenues by developing novel conjugates of the active ASAs pharmacophore. These conjugates were designed to incorporate the ASA with other moieties which show therapeutically useful properties. This report includes the design, synthesis and characterisation of novel ASA and aliphatic amino acid (AA) conjugates with the antioxidant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EOTA). Diglyceride and model polymeric delivery systems were also investigated, although, these two alternative areas were not highly successful. All the EOTA conjugatesÃ‚Â· described in this study are readily synthesised in two steps using standard methyl ester and amide-bond formation techniques. A wide range of biochemical properties were studied for the conjugates synthesised in this project. These studies determined the effectiveness of the conjugates in the combat against IBOs. These properties included metal ion chelation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) suppression, proteolytic and <b>pH</b> <b>stabilities,</b> as well as anti-cancer activity. Firstly, the chelation of labile transition metal ions has been shown to remove the ion's pro-oxidant activity. The removal of pro-oxidant activities by chelation could assist in the treatment of IBOs, which has been shown to be linked with oxidative stress. Secondly, due to a link between ROS and IBOs, the discovered ROS suppression would also be advantageous in the combat against IBOs. Thirdly, the gastrointestinal stability of these conjugates is favourable; as, reaching the disease site (Le. the colon and terminal ileum) intact would enable the conjugates to function as designed. And fourthly, due to a link between IBOs and cancer, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid bis-(5 -aminosalicylic acid methyl ester) was tested in the National Cancer Institute's 60 cancer cell-line. Ã‚Â· The synthesised conjugates showed an ideal 1 : 1 binding ratio with the transition metal ions Cu(lI) and Fe(III). ROS suppression was observed for all the synthesised compounds whe~ chelatcd to redox active transition metal ions. In the stability studies, it was found that the ASA conjuga. tes wereÃ‚Â· stable to proteolytic attack. This was in contrast to the AA conjugates, which wereÃ‚Â· readily degraded by protease. Additionally, all the studied conjugates showed excellent <b>pH</b> <b>stabilities.</b> And lastly; the 5 -ASA-EDTA conjugate showed promising in vitro anti-cancer activity. This study reports novel anti-inflammatory conjugates, which show promising properties for use in the combat against IBOs. Results from this project have shown that the conjugates are able to chelate toxic, unbound transition metal ions, which in turn forms strong ROS suppressors. The work within this report has also shown excellent protease and <b>pH</b> <b>stabilities</b> of the ASA conjugates, which would enable them to travel through the upper gastrointestinal tract intact. Upon reaching the ~ite of disease, they would be able to either act as novel anti-inflammatory, chelating conjugates, or, as prodrugs which would then release the ASA moiety via bacterial reduction, The anti-cancer activity shown for one of the conjugates would also be beneficial in IBO treatment.

40|$|Two {{structural}} Ca 2 + (proximal and distal) {{is known}} to be important for ligninolytic peroxidases. However, few studies toward impact of residues involved in two Ca 2 + on properties of ligninolytic peroxidases have been done, especially the proximal one. In this study, mutants of nine residues involved in liganding two Ca 2 + of Pleurotus eryngii versatile peroxidase (VP) were investigated. Most mutants almost completely lost activities, except the mutants of proximal Ca 2 + - S 170 A and V 192 T. In comparison with WT (wild type), optimal pH values of S 170 A, S 170 D, and V 192 T shifted from pH 3. 0 to pH 3. 5. The order of thermal and <b>pH</b> <b>stabilities</b> of WT, V 192 T, S 170 A, and S 170 D {{is similar to that of}} their specific activities: WT > V 192 T > S 170 A > S 170 D. The CD (circular dichroism) results of WT and several mutants indicated that mutations had some effects on secondary structures.

40|$|A new trypsin {{inhibitor}} (EATI) was isolated from Entada acaciifolia (Benth.) seeds. EATI is a competitive inhibitor with a molecular mass of 20 kDa and an inhibition stoichiometry of 1 : 1 for bovine trypsin. The dissociation constant (K-i) calculated was 1. 75 nmol/L, displaying a high affinity between enzyme and inhibitor. Both Native PAGE and RP-HPLC revealed that EATI {{is composed of}} four isoinhibitors that share the amino acid composition and the amino-terminal sequence homolog to Kunitz-type inhibitors. EATI is stable to denaturation by heat (up to 70 degrees C), pH (2 - 10), urea (8 mol/L) and its inhibitory activity was unaltered in different concentrations of DTT (up to 100 mmol/L). CD analysis revealed that EATI in reduced form underwent structural modifications associated with a decrease in thermal and <b>pH</b> <b>stabilities,</b> suggesting that their disulfide bonds {{are not involved in}} the structuring of its reactive site, but are important for maintenance of its conformational stability.

However, the relatively low stability towards pH of this and other fungal peroxidases is a drawback for their industrial application. A strategy based on the comparative analysis of the crystal structures of VP and the highly pH-stable manganese peroxidase (MnP 4) from Pleurotus ostreatus was followed to improve the VP <b>pH</b> <b>stability.</b> Several interactions, including hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, and charged residues exposed to the solvent were identified as putatively contributing to the <b>pH</b> <b>stability</b> of MnP 4. The eight amino acid residues responsible for these interactions and seven surface basic residues were introduced into VP by directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, two cysteines were also included to explore the effect of an extra disulfide bond stabilizing the distal Ca 2 + region. Three of the four designed variants were crystallized and new interactions were confirmed, being correlated with the observed improvement in <b>pH</b> <b>stability.</b> The extra hydrogen bonds and salt bridges stabilized the heme pocket at acidic and neutral pH as revealed by UV-visible spectroscopy. They led to a VP variant that retained a significant percentage of the initial activity at both pH 3. 5 (61 % after 24 h) and pH 7 (55 % after 120 h) compared with the native enzyme, which was almost completely inactivated. The introduction of extra solvent-exposed basic residues and an additional disulfide bond into the above variant further improved the stability at acidic pH (85 % residual activity at pH 3. 5 after 24 h when introduced separately, and 64 % at pH 3 when introduced together).
