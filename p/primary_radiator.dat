40|$|Abstract- A fixed {{shaped beam}} antenna offers an {{excellent}} compromise between cost and system performance in {{high data rate}} systems operating in the frequency range of 5 - 65 GHz. Shaped Dielectric Lenses perform the task of collimation and shaping, along with physically small feed antennas, to obtain multiple and shaped beams in a fixed set of directions. Lenses are inherently broadband, easy to fabricate, have lower dimensional tolerances, cost effective and act as radome for the <b>primary</b> <b>radiators</b> that are embedded inside or placed behind the lens. Earlier techniques {{for the analysis of}} shaped dielectric lenses, employed ray tracing methods of GO and PO, that are valid only in the far field of a primary point source type of radiator. But the dielectric lens is in the near field of finite sized <b>primary</b> <b>radiators</b> oriented at different angles and at different distances from the lens center. In this paper we discuss, a new accurate analytical procedure for the radiation pattern of a spherical lens excited by a rectangular patch. The lens is treated as a scatterer. Techniques for radial translation and spatial rotation of the small aperture Spherical Modal Complex Coefficients (SMCC) are utilized to align them to the phase center of the Dielectric Lens. The SMCC of the scattered fields due to the lens are then obtained by application of boundary conditions. Sample computations are performed to demonstrate the approach and supported by experimental results...|$|R

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. This paper {{describes}} a thermal switching cryogenic heat pipe, which {{is needed to}} thermally manage two CCD cameras within the ABC instrument on the NASA/JPL SIM Lite telescope. The primary requirement is to transport 12 W from the 150 K CCD cameras to a 140 K <b>primary</b> <b>radiator</b> 1. 4 m away. The heat pipe is a 1. 5 cm OD Al axial groove design with methane as the working fluid, which provides 75 W-m of transport capacity at 140 K. A secondary requirement is to periodically heat (decontaminate) the CCD cameras to 293 K with minimal heater power. To meet the decontamination requirement, the heat pipe was modified to provide thermal switching by using small diameter SS tubing to connect it to a liquid trap (LT) cooled by a small secondary radiator (SR) which is thermally isolated from the <b>primary</b> <b>radiator</b> (PR). The LT is a scaled-up version of the LTs used on the CRISM flight system. During normal operation, a small heater keeps the LT filled only with vapor. During decontamination, the LT heater is turned OFF, the PR is heated by midsized heaters and/or heat pipe conduction, the SR-cooled LT captures the working fluid effectively turning the heat pipe OFF, and a small evaporator heater raises the instrument temperature to 293 K. When the LT heater is re-enabled, the system returns to normal operation. This paper describes the design, fabrication, and testing of this demonstration system...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{the nasal}} {{resonances}} in singing is unclear. Teachers of singing often advise singers to place their voice "in the mask': which may mean that the singers are supposed to project or focus their attention to vibrations of the skull and forehead. Such vibrations are produced in the bony structures of the cranium by the sound pressure in the vocal tract. According to the testimony of many singers sensations in the "mask " provide a useful feedback and even evoke {{the impression that the}} sound is emitted from these parts of the head while, in reality, the <b>primary</b> sound <b>radiator</b> is the mouth opening, except for some nasalized sounds. Provided the velar port is slightly open so as to permit some nasal colouring, the nasal cavities may contribute to the colouring of a singer's voice. The behavior of the velum during various vocal exercises is inspectedfiom above by means of ajiberscope introduced into the nose of some professional singers. Also the oral and nasal flow signals are analysed. The results suggest differing velar strategies.

The <b>primary</b> <b>radiator</b> consists of two bowtie dipoles arranged orthogonally through double printed rings.

By controlling the current paths from the feeding coaxial line to each dipole arm and among these arms, the antenna can change its radiation among circular polarization (CP) with both rotating senses and linear polarization at three different angles, namely, 0 Â°, 90 Â°, and 45 Â°. The fabricated prototype exhibits an impedance bandwidth (BW) of 37. 1 % from 2. 2 to 3. 2 GHz for all polarization states.

The power system consists of a solar concentrator, solar heat receiver, Stirling heat engine, linear alternator and waste heat radiator. The solar concentrator focuses the sun's energy into a heat receiver. The engine and alternator convert a portion of this energy to electric power and the remaining heat is rejected by a waste heat <b>radiator.</b> <b>Primary</b> liquid metal heat pipes transport heat energy to the Stirling engine. Thermal energy storage allows this power system to operate during the shade portion of an orbit. Lithium fluoride/calcium fluoride eutectic is the thermal energy storage material.

The secondary vapor cavity heat pipe serves three important functions. First, it smooths out hot spots in the solar cavity and provides even distribution of heat to the engine. Second, the event of a heat pipe failure, the secondary heat pipe cavity can efficiently transfer heat from other operating primary heat pipes to the engine heat exchanger of the defunct heat pipe. Third, the secondary heat pipe vapor cavity reduces temperature drops caused by heat flow into the engine. This unique design provides a high level of reliability and performance...|$|R

The formation heat of the PEMFC power module is so large that the cooling subsystem is necessary to reject the redundant heat {{in order to maintain the}} optimal operating temperature of the PEMFC stack. The cooling subsystem consists of the primary and secondary radiators which reside in the lower left and lower middle sections of the power plant, respectively. The secondary radiator is applied for heat transfer of the stack condenser that is used to insure that enough process water be made available at all time for air humidification. The <b>primary</b> <b>radiator</b> will suck air and exhaust it through the shutter of the locomotive framework. Under normal conditions, the leaked hydrogen will be exhausted through the ventilation outlet of the PEMFC stack module, and the ventilation fans located on the upper side of the locomotive will assist in precluding confinement of any accidentally leaked hydrogen.|$|E

Experiments were performed on a 70 Â° sphere-cone in the X 3 expansion tube at average freestream velocity, pitot pressure, static pressure, and density of 5 : 83 km=s, 76 kPa, 1. 15 kPa, and 2 : 43 Ã 10 - 3 kg=m 3, respectively. The radiation gauges used thin-film-sensing elements mounted behind a borosilicate window on the windward surface and were therefore shielded from the convective heat transfer. The assembled gauges are uniformly sensitive for radiation in the wavelength range from 0. 347 to 2 mand give an integrated measurement of the total radiant flux in this band.
