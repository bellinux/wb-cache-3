When Hammond left to tour Australia in 1946–47, Ness-Harvey remained behind with his mother, with whom she did not get along. This was one of the factors which led to Hammond's <b>problems</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tour. His divorce went through, and on his return, he and Sybil married at Kingston Register Office. She had already changed her name to Hammond by deed poll. Their first child, Roger, was born in 1948. Carolyn was born in 1950 and Valerie was born in 1952.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} {{counting the number of}} 3 -colourings of the edges (bonds) of the 4 - 8 lattice and the 3 - 12 lattice. These lattices are Archimedean with coordination number 3, and can be regarded as decorated versions of the square and honeycomb lattice, respectively. We solve these edge-colouring problems in the infinite-lattice limit by mapping them to other models whose solution is known. <b>The</b> colouring <b>problem</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 4 - 8 lattice is mapped to a completely packed loop model with loop fugacity n = 3 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> square lattice, which in turn can be mapped to a six-vertex model. <b>The</b> colouring <b>problem</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 3 - 12 lattice is mapped to <b>the</b> same <b>problem</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> honeycomb lattice. <b>The</b> 3 -edge-colouring <b>problem</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 4 - 8 and 3 - 12 lattices are equivalent to the 3 -vertex-colouring problem (and thus to the zero-temperature 3 -state antiferromagnetic Potts model) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> “square kagome ” (“squagome”) and “triangular kagome ” lattices, respectively. ...|$|R

5|$|Henry III {{added to}} the {{endowment}} left by Peter des Roches, donating farmland, urban property in Southampton and elsewhere, and spiritual revenues from churches. By 1291, taxation returns show that the abbey had a clear annual revenue of £81, a comfortable income. However, shortly afterwards a period of bad management resulted in the abbey accruing substantial debts, and it was soon almost bankrupt. In 1328 the government was forced to appoint an administrator, John of Mere, to address the crisis. Despite forcing the abbot to apply revenues to debt repayment and to sell many of the estates, the operation was only partly successful. Ten years later the abbey was again appealing to the king for help with a disastrous financial situation. The monks blamed their <b>problems</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cost of providing hospitality to the many travellers by sea, and the king's sailors who landed at the abbey. The king provided some small grants enabling the abbey to overcome its difficulties but the property sales meant that the abbey's income never recovered and it settled into what {{has been described as}} genteel poverty.|$|E
5|$|In 1867 the {{formerly}} independent Hammersmith and City Railway was {{absorbed by the}} Metropolitan Railway and the Great Western Railway, and was operated from then on by Metropolitan Railway trains. The plan for a terminus in Fulham was abandoned, and the line instead turned west at Hammersmith to run over London and South Western Railway tracks to Richmond. Although Wandsworth Town railway station, near {{the southern end of}} the bridge, had provided direct connections to central London since 1846, the lack of rail connections opening on the north bank meant the area on the Fulham side remained undeveloped, and bridge usage was low. Tolmé's design was not sturdy enough to carry heavy vehicles, and drainage <b>problems</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> approach road to the north discouraged vehicles from using Wandsworth Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{with the}} thawing of Sino-Indian relations, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to China {{led to the}} {{resumption}} of talks on opening the border.

The opening, originally scheduled for 2 October 2005, was postponed due to last-minute infrastructure <b>problems</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Chinese side. Finally, {{after a decade of}} talks, Nathu La was opened on 6 July 2006. The date of the reopening, which also formally recognised Tibet as part of China by India and Sikkim's accession to India, coincided with the birthday of the reigning Dalai Lama.

5|$|<b>Problems</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> backstraight {{had been}} mostly {{rectified}} although a wet track {{surface in the}} first and fourth turns appeared caused by water coming from under the grandstands. Race officials deliberated {{on the morning of the}} race before declaring the track safe following the completion of repairs. The drivers took to the track at 11:15a.m local time for a ten-minute practice session. Carpentier set the fastest time with a lap of 27.075 seconds; Franchitti was second and Jimmy Vasser rounded out the session's top three drivers. A second session, lasting 90 minutes, began at 12:20p.m. local time. Kanaan recorded the session's fastest lap with a time of 24.719 seconds, ahead of Bräck in second and Tracy third. Three yellow caution flags were shown: the first was for Max Papis who cut his right-rear tyre, the second was for Maurício Gugelmin who slid out of the groove and hit the turn one outside barrier. His car slid across the wall and stopped at the corner's exit. The final stoppage was for a track inspection after Castroneves' pit crew reported the driver's right rear tyre was cut.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s were {{a period}} of off-field turmoil for Bayern, with many changes in {{personnel}} and financial <b>problems.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> field, Paul Breitner and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, termed FC Breitnigge, led the team to Bundesliga titles in 1980 and 1981. Apart from a DFB-Pokal win in 1982, two relatively unsuccessful seasons followed, after which Breitner retired and former coach Udo Lattek returned. Bayern won the DFB-Pokal in 1984 {{and went on to}} win five Bundesliga championships in six seasons, including a double in 1986. European success, however, was elusive during the decade; Bayern managed to claim the runners-up spot in the European Cup in 1982 and 1987.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} a {{concentric}} fortress, which von Haschenperg had hoped would combine the best of Italian military architecture, able to carry heavy guns but with a low profile to protect against any incoming artillery fire. Various flaws rapidly became apparent. The castle's design had focused on defence, {{with the result that}} the guns could not easily be brought to bear on enemy vessels, which had been the original intent of building the fortification by the Camber; some of the angles of fire from the defences were blocked by the entrance and the high water table may have caused serious damp <b>problems</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground floor. Furthermore, the design was different from the other Device Forts constructed across the region and would have stood out as unusual and not in keeping with the King's general intent for the chain of forts.|$|E

On June 11, 1952, the city acquired all trackage west of Mott Avenue, incorporating {{it as part of}} the IND Rockaway Line. Service provided by the A train over the line began in June 1956, with the full western spur to Rockaway Park operational. While the remainder of the line operated, with Beach 25th Street–Wavecrest serving as the eastern spur terminal, a new Far Rockaway subway station was constructed, opening on January 16, 1958.|$|E
5|$|After {{a two-hour}} delay, {{the race was}} restarted. Rahal {{suffered}} clutch <b>problems</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> restart, which placed him two laps down, while the other drivers ran behind the safety car, during which the marshalls showed {{the areas in which}} repair work had been conducted. Just prior to the restart, there was a short rain shower which made the track slightly slippy. Power lost one position on the restart, dropping to third. Franchitti, who was the closest driver to the front to have the softer compound red tires fitted gained two positions on the restart, moving up to fourth. The restart only lasted for six corners, before Castroneves spun in the wet conditions, and was then struck by Ed Carpenter. On the next corner, Josef Newgarden had slid into the wall and stalled, and a full-track caution was again called. The race was restarted with nine laps remaining, and Franchitti once more gained a position, passing Pagenaud to gain second. However, the race was almost immediately under a yellow flag again as E.J. Viso was spun by Marco Andretti, and stalled in the middle of turn four. From the ensuing restart, Dixon managed to maintain the lead from Franchitti, and the two Chip Ganassi Racing drivers completed a second successive one-two finish.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, CART {{encountered}} problems {{in promoting the}} race. They were unable to adequately educate British motor racing fans about the series. Rockingham's owners attempted to display an advertisement at the 2001 British Grand Prix but the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone cancelled the plan shortly before {{it was due to}} occur. A major marketing strategy took place in response. The advertising, headed by the Michaelides & Bednash agency, began in August in the printed press, and also included two television advertisements and an official poster. The event was affected by drainage <b>problems</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new track which caused the practice sessions to be cancelled. The starting order was set according to the drivers' positions in the points' standings. Its distance was reduced from 210 to 140 laps and was won by Team Penske driver Gil de Ferran after overtaking pole position starter Kenny Bräck on the race's final lap. Most drivers praised the circuit but did not criticise the problem that affected it. Despite two days of practice and qualifying rounds being cancelled because of the drainage issues, 38,000 spectators watched the race. The track later had an extra layer added along with a sealant to allow it to drain water.|$|E
