40|$|The virtual economy {{argument}} for Russia suggests that barter -a payment in goods rather than cash - allows {{the parties to}} pretend that the manufacturing sector is producing value added by enabling this sector to sell its output at a higher price than its market value. We confront this prediction with the actual <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> of industrial sectors in the Ukraine in 1997. Based on pricing data of 165 barter deals we find no systematic difference in the <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> in non-cash transactions across sectors.

Under the Efficient Market Hypothesis their <b>price</b> <b>behaviour,</b> as far as the speed of adjustment to news is concerned, should be the same.

40|$|Price risk {{associated}} with maize production became a reason for concern in South Africa only after the deregulation of the agricultural commodities markets in the mid- 1990 s, when farmers became responsible for marketing their own crops. Although farmers can use, inter alia, the cash forward contracting and/or the derivatives market to manage price risk, few farmers actually participate in forward pricing. A similar reluctance to use forward pricing methods is also found internationally. A number of different model specifications {{have been used in}} previous research to model forward <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> which {{is based on the assumption}} that the same variables influence both the adoption and the quantity decision. This study compares the results from a model specification which models forward <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> in a single-decision framework with the results from modelling the quantity decision conditional to the adoption decision in a two-step approach. The results suggest that substantially more information is obtained by modelling forward <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> as two separate decisions rather than a single decision. Such information may be valuable in educational material compiled to educate farmers in the effective use of forward pricing methods in price risk management. Modelling forward <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> as two separate decisions  is thus a more effective means of modelling forward <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> than modelling it as a single decision...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the strategic <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> (Pricing to Market; PTM) policies of textile exports in the 1990 s for a hyperinflation country, Turkey, whose currency has been depreciating continually {{for the last}} two decades. The findings show that Turkish textile export categories exhibit evidence of strategic <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> when the Turkish textiles export data is analysed for different frequencies. The results show that evidence of strategic <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> is observed in response to changes in real exchange rates for textile exports for closer lagging periods and strategic <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> diminishes with further lagging periods. Also, evidence of strategic <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> is observed in a more recurrent fashion with higher frequency data, three-month periods, than with relatively lower frequency data, six-month and 12 -month periods. Another interesting finding is that Turkish textile exporters prefer to increase their prices as a reaction if they had adjusted their prices in an overshooting fashion in response to real exchange changes in the previous period. The most important finding of the paper is that while Turkish textile exporters prefer to adjust their export pricing without fully absorbing the real exchange depreciation and by increasing their relative markups for some textile categories, they prefer to adjust their export prices by lowering their markups in addition to fully absorbing the real exchange depreciation for some other textile categories in order to increase their market share overseas. ...|$|E

The research examines ex-dividend day share <b>price</b> <b>behaviour</b> to determine empirically the estimated value of imputation tax credits in the New Zealand sharemarket, and tests the ‘tax-effect hypothesis’ that share <b>price</b> <b>behaviour</b> on ex-dividend day reflects marginal investors’ after tax value valuation of income received as dividends as opposed to capital gains.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the {{literature}} relating to the ex-dividend day <b>price</b> <b>behaviour</b> of securities, for both the US and UK Stock Markets. Two major hypotheses have been developed that attempt to explain the cause and magnitude of the price drop-off, relative to the dividend, on the ex-dividend day. These are: (i) the long-term trading hypothesis, which argues that ex-day pricing reflects the marginal tax rates prevailing on that date, and (ii) the short-term trading hypothesis that argues that ex-day prices are determined by the arbitrage activity of short-term traders. Depending on who we assume to be the dominant trader around the ex-dividend day, we obtain different predictions about the ex-day <b>price</b> <b>behaviour.</b> There exists some further research, however, that suggests that both the above models offer an insufficient description of what in fact goes on on the ex-dividend day, because they ignore the existence of buying pressure both before and after the ex-day and risk considerations. The implications of the current UK tax regime on ex-day pricing will be examined, with particular reference to specific investor groups. In addition to this, we will consider how the institutional changes brought about by the Big Bang of 27 th October 1986, might influence the ex-day <b>price</b> <b>behaviour.</b> 1...|$|R

Since for-profit insurers were not allowed in this market, potential spillover effects from the presence of for-profit insurers on the behaviour of nonprofit insurers were absent. Using a panel data set for all health insurers operating in the Dutch social health insurance market over the period 1996 - 2004, we estimate a premium model to determine which factors explain the price setting behaviour of nonprofit health insurers. We find that financial stability rather than profit maximisation offers the best explanation for health plan <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour.</b> In the presence of weak price competition, health insurers did not set premiums to maximize profits. Nevertheless, {{our findings suggest that}} regulations on financial reserves are needed to restrict premiums.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the past <b>price</b> <b>behaviour</b> on the realized volatility is investigated in the present article. The results show that trending (drifting) prices lead to increased (decreased) realized volatility. This ``volatility induced by trend'' constitutes a new stylized fact. The past <b>price</b> <b>behaviour</b> is measured by a product of 2 non overlapping returns, of the form r L[r] where L is the lag operator. The effect is studied empirically using USD/CHF foreign exchange data, in a large range of time horizons. A set of ARCH based processes are modified in order to include the trend effect, and their forecasting performances are compared. For a better forecast, it is shown that the main factor is {{the shape of the}} memory kernel (i. e. power law), and the following factor is the inclusion of the trend effect. ...|$|R

Using a game theoretic model of incumbent firms’ <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> under these conditions, {{it is found that}} under the assumption of Bertrand competition and firms having different costs, the optimal <b>pricing</b> <b>behaviour</b> imply price stickiness and upward pricing. The findings further suggest a competitive behaviour of incumbents of disposing weaker opponents only if, it leads to weaker competitors entering the market and to use weaker opponents to shelter the incumbent. The results propose a new explanation of the mixed empirical findings on incumbent pricing to entry and suggest that competition authorities should use an effect-based approach to detect the behaviour. ...|$|E

In particular we focus on <b>price</b> <b>behaviour</b> using daily market indexes from 40 stock exchanges over the period 1989 to 1997. Our results are not consistent with the over-reaction hypothesis. We find positive (negative) abnormal price performance in the short-term windows (up to 10 days) following positive (negative) price shocks. Our analysis also highlights some important differences across markets classified as either developed or emerging. While the price shock occurrences are evenly distributed between our two groups of markets, we show that the post-shock abnormal performances are significantly larger for our sample of emerging markets.
