5000|$|<b>Proctoscopy</b> is {{a common}} medical {{procedure}} in which an instrument called a proctoscope (also known as a rectoscope, although the latter {{may be a bit}} longer) is used to examine the anal cavity, rectum, or sigmoid colon. A proctoscope is a short, straight, rigid, hollow metal tube, and usually has a small light bulb mounted at the end. It is approximately 5 inches or 15 cm long, while a rectoscope is approximately 10 inches or 25 cm long. During <b>proctoscopy,</b> the proctoscope is lubricated and inserted into the rectum, and then the [...] is removed, allowing an unobstructed view of the interior of the rectal cavity. This procedure is normally done to inspect for hemorrhoids or rectal polyps and might be mildly uncomfortable as the proctoscope is inserted further into the rectum. Modern fibre-optic proctoscopes allow more extensive observation with less discomfort.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Patients with perineal {{burns and}} {{immobile}} hospitalized patients with severe excoriation from incontinence caused by excessive diarrhea pose difficult management problems, frequently requiring stoma formation. The Zassi Bowel Management System (Zassi Medical Evolutions, Fernandina Beach, Florida) multichannel intrarectal catheter was evaluated for its safety {{and its ability}} to divert feces away from perineal skin to allow wound and skin healing. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted on inpatients from the Burns and Geriatric Units. Patients with previous rectal disease were excluded. Perineal skin and wound healing was measured before and after tube insertion by using the perianal disease activity index score. Data regarding patient comfort, wound contamination, dressing changes, bed linen changes, and adverse events were collected. <b>Proctoscopy</b> was performed before and after tube insertion. RESULTS: Twenty-two tubes were inserted in 20 patients (7 perineal burns, 13 severe perineal excoriations). Mean perianal disease activity index scores reduced from 14 to 6. 4 (P < 0. 0001) after tube insertion. Mean dressing changes reduced from 3. 3 to 1. 5 times per day (P < 0. 01), and mean bed linen changes in the incontinent patients reduced from 9. 3 to 1. 2 times per day (P < 0. 0001). Mean duration of rectal intubation was 14 days. <b>Proctoscopy</b> after tube removal was normal in all cases. One patient developed a superficial ulcer on the buttock from retention strapping. CONCLUSIONS: The Zassi Bowel Management System tube allows diversion of feces away from the perineum for wound healing. It is safe, effective, and may help avoid stoma formation. 6 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Abstract PURPOSE: The risk {{of cancer}} or severe {{polyposis}} of the rectal stump after total colectomy for MutYH-associated polyposis is scarcely defined. To evaluate this risk, we describe the findings of endoscopic surveillance of the rectal stump {{in a series of}} patients with biallelic MutYH mutations and polyposis. METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational, multicenter case series derived from 2 familial cancer registries. Biallelic, germ-line MutYH mutations were found in 14 patients with no adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutations. Eleven of them underwent total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis and yearly proctoscopic surveillance thereafter. Phenotype and histology of rectal polyps were recorded at diagnosis and during follow-up. Development of adenomas and carcinomas during endoscopic surveillance of the rectal stump was observed. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 6 patients had attenuated polyposis (10 - 100 adenomas), 5 patients had classical polyposis, 8 patients had colon carcinoma, and no patient had rectal carcinoma. The mean number of rectal polyps at diagnosis was 2. 64 Â± 2. 11 (range, 0 - 6). No patients had rectal cancer. The most frequent MutYH mutations were Y 165 C/Y 165 C and G 382 D/G 382 D in 6 and 2 patients, respectively. During surveillance of the rectal stump after surgery (median duration, 5 y; range, 2 - 23 y), no patient developed rectal cancer. The mean number of adenomas per <b>proctoscopy</b> was 1. 23 Â± 2. 19 (range, 0 - 10 adenomas per <b>proctoscopy).</b> This study was limited by the small size and retrospective nature of the case series. CONCLUSION: Total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis may be appropriate for patients with MutYH-associated polyposis, provided that they have no rectal cancer or severe rectal polyposis at presentation and that they undergo yearly endoscopic surveillance thereafter...|$|E
