50|$|A cable {{repair ship}} {{will be sent}} to the {{location}} to drop a marker buoy near the break. Several types of grapples are used depending on the situation. If the sea bed in question is sandy, a grapple with rigid prongs is used to <b>plough</b> <b>under</b> the surface and catch the cable. If the cable is on a rocky sea surface, the grapple is more flexible, with hooks along its length so that it can adjust to the changing surface. In especially deep water, the cable may not be strong enough to lift as a single unit, so a special grapple that cuts the cable soon after it has been hooked is used and only one length of cable is brought to the surface at a time, whereupon a new section is spliced in. The repaired cable is longer than the original, so the excess is deliberately laid in a 'U' shape on the seabed. A submersible can be used to repair cables that lie in shallower waters.|$|E

An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of using different primary tillage implements and soil conditions on draft force, tractor rear wheel slippage, traveling speed, drawbar power, theoretical and effective field capacities, efficiency and fuel consumption rate of a two-wheel drive tractor. High draft, slippage, field efficiencies and fuel consumption rates were recorded in the firm (fallow ridged) soil, while higher traveling speed and theoretical and effective field capacities were obtained for the loose (disc harrowed) soil and the differences were significant at 5 % level. It was found that draft and speed accounted for 76. 9 % and 20 % of the variability in the drawbar power, respectively, while draft and speed jointly accounted for 96. 3 % of the power variability. Chisel plough in loose soil showed the highest power requirement of 8. 77 Kw and the highest theoretical and effective field capacities of 0. 562 ha/h and 0. 443 ha/h, respectively.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a reversible animal-drawn plough and a ridger is presented. The plough was developed {{on the basis of}} laboratory experiments reported earlier to determine optimum parameters for acurved implement. The basic design principles of conventional mouldboard ploughs and an ard were taken into consideration. A safety mechanism was developed which was a shear bolt. Apart from the share point, all components of the plough were made from wood, and the total mass was about 10 kg. The orientational parameters of the developed implement such as the tail angle, rake angle and the side-rake angle can be varied to suit the required soil operations and the pulling capability of the draught animals. The developed plough can also be used as a ridger by mounting an extra wing on the plough. Comparative field experiments were conducted in cooperation with the International Livestock Research Institute. ILRI, using the developed and traditional ard-type plough in Ethiopia. Tests were carried out in fields under various soil conditions using oxen and cows. The results showed that the draught required by the developed plough was about 30 percent less than the draught of the traditional Ethiopian ard. A frequency analysis was made to determine the dominant frequencies of the reversible <b>plough</b> <b>under</b> working conditions. The identified frequencies were 0. 5, 1. 3 and 3. 3 Hz. Preliminary assessments were made to compare the performances of a pair of cows with a pair of oxen in relation to speed and forces when pulling the developed plough. A pair of cows moved faster (an average of 0. 84 m/s) than the pair of oxen (an average of 0. 63 m/s) and exerted proportionally greater pulling forces when operating in the same field. The difference in speed is explained by the greater body weight of the cows and the correspondingly greater pull that could be exerted...|$|E

Seed of soybean cultivar Proteinka (maturity group 0) was inoculated directly before planting, using microbial fertilizer NS-Nitragin containing a mixture of selected highly effective Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains.
