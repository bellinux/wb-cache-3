40|$|Abstract Background Improving {{health in}} our nation {{requires}} strengthening four major domains of the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system: <b>personal</b> <b>health</b> management, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> delivery, public <b>health,</b> and health-related research. Many avoidable shortcomings in the health sector that result in poor quality are due to inaccessible data, information, and knowledge. A national health information infrastructure (NHII) offers the connectivity and knowledge management essential to correct these shortcomings. Better health and a better health system are within our reach. Discussion A national health information infrastructure for the United States should {{address the needs of}} <b>personal</b> <b>health</b> management, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> delivery, public <b>health,</b> and research. It should also address relevant global dimensions (e. g., standards for sharing data and knowledge across national boundaries). The public and private sectors will need to collaborate to build a robust national health information infrastructure, essentially a 'paperless' <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system, for the United States. The federal government should assume leadership for assuring a national health information infrastructure as recommended by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics and the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee. Progress is needed in the areas of funding, incentives, standards, and continued refinement of a privacy (i. e., confidentiality and security) framework to facilitate <b>personal</b> identification for <b>health</b> purposes. Particular attention should be paid to NHII leadership and change management challenges. Summary A national health information infrastructure is a necessary step for improved health in the U. S. It will require a concerted, collaborative effort by both public and private sectors. If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it. Lord Kelvin </p...|$|R

40|$|Health {{services}} demonstrate {{key features}} of complex adaptive systems (CAS), they are dynamic and unfold in unpredictable ways, and unfolding events are often unique. To {{better understand the}} complex adaptive nature of health systems around a core attractor we propose {{the metaphor of the}} <b>health</b> <b>care</b> vortex. We also suggest that in an ideal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system the core attractor would be <b>personal</b> <b>health</b> attainment. <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> reforms around the world offer an opportunity to analyse health system change from a complex adaptive perspective. At large <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reforms have been pursued disregarding the complex adaptive nature of the health system. The paper details some recent reforms and outlines how to understand their strategies and outcomes, and what could be learnt for future efforts, utilising CAS principles. Current health systems show the inherent properties of a CAS driven by a core attractor of disease and cost containment. We content that more meaningful health systems reform requires the delicate task of shifting the core attractor from disease and cost containment towards health attainment...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{deployment}} {{and adoption}} of Integrated <b>Personal</b> <b>Health</b> and <b>Care</b> Services in Europe {{has been slow}} and fragmented. There have been many initiatives and projects of this kind in different European regions, {{many of which have}} not gone beyond the pilot stage. We investigated the necessary conditions for a successful adoption of such services into the mainstreaming in care pathways. Methods: We conducted a qualitative analysis of 27 Telehealth, Telecare and Integrated <b>Personal</b> <b>Health</b> System projects, implemented across 20 regions in eight European countries. The analysis is based on Suter's ten key principles for successful health systems integration. Results: Out of the 27 cases, only 11 succeeded beyond the pilot stage. We focussed on the 11 success cases to define which key facilitators are necessary for successful deployment and adoption in the European regions of our study. Conclusion: From the studied cases, we may extract a promising trend of increasing awareness and introduction of Integrated <b>Personal</b> <b>Health</b> and <b>Care</b> Services in European regions, as we found evidence of cases that succeeded beyond the pilot stage. Further research will reveal the weight of each facilitator and the combination amongst them which can lead to rapid adoption. JRC. J. 3 -Information Societ...|$|R
