40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, China {{has adopted a}} series of {{policies}} to promote the development of private forest farming. The early moves to increase private participation in forestry {{were based on the}} introduction of the Household Responsibility System in the agriculture sector in the late 1970 s. Since then, private forest farming has been developing throughout the country and become a main form of forest management in some collective forest regions, variously through sole proprietorships, leaseholder arrangements, partnership arrangements, joint management of state forests and foreign investment. With the shift of timber supply source from natural forests to plantations and the increasing demand for timber generated by the rapid development of the economy, a great potential exists for private forest farming to be further developed. It is therefore important to develop a policy framework that can encourage private participation in plantation development. This study reviewed the evolution of and future prospects for forestry property rights and the other factors likely to influence private forest farming. It identified a number of policy changes needed to ensure that private forest farming continues to expand. The continuing role of central and other levels of government in overcoming impediments is noted, as well as the special role governments must continue to play in relation to the development of <b>protective</b> <b>plantations.</b> Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E

40|$|The author {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of field-protective forest plantations on the diversity and quantity of pests and entomophages in interbelt cereal agrocenoses of the steppe and dry steppe natural zones. It is revealed that the <b>protective</b> forest <b>plantations</b> play {{important role in the}} biota and the food chains management within agrocenoses. It is identified that the forest belts have smoothing influence on the change in the abundance of insects belonging to the different trophic groups on the developped fields. The peaks in the number of harmful and useful insects coincide in these fields, whereas in treeless agrocenoses the rise in useful components density takes place only after a year of the mass reproduction of pests. The growth and development of cereal crops is accompanied by {{the increase in the number}} of insects in the stalks of the crops. At the same time, the abundance of different insect groups varies. This applies both to the inhabitants of the stalks and to the complex insects on the surface of the ground...|$|R
40|$|Dobrogea {{province}} {{is composed}} by Constanta and Tulcea counties, {{situated in the}} South-eastern part of Romania, and it is {{known as one of}} the driest parts of Romania. The yearly amount of precipitations is no more than 400 - 450 mm. The yearly average temperature is around 10. 5 oC; the soils are of good quality but the main factor limiting the crops is, in this case, the lack of the water. During 1949 and 1955, studies were carried out concerning the damages produced by drought and the influence of the forest <b>plantations</b> for <b>protective</b> purposes on crops. Consequently, there have been planted protective forests on a few thousand hectares in the southern part of Constanta county but which were insufficient in order to protect all the agricultural lands. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the rehabilitation of the irrigation systems in the near future in Dobrogea, several projects were made in order to set up <b>protective</b> forest <b>plantations.</b> These projects include 70 localities and there have already been planted protective forests in some of them. The width of these forests is 10 m, the planting scheme is 2 x 1 m, and the distance between them is variable, by the case. The locust tree is the used specie...|$|R
40|$|Aley {{river basin}} {{is one of}} the most {{developed}} territories in West Siberia. Initially, the development here was related to the development of ore mining in the Altai. Currently it is associated mainly with the agricultural orientation of economic development. The intensive involvement of basin lands into the economic turnover for the last 100 years contributed to the formation of a number of environmental problems, such as water and wind erosion, loss of soil fertility and salinization, and desertification of the territory. Besides, the decrease of Aley river water content due to natural and anthropogenic reasons was observed. A specific feature of water management in Aley river basin is a significant amount of water resources used for irrigation purposes and agricultural water supply. To ensure the economic and drinking water supply, two reservoirs and a number of ponds have been constructed and operate in the basin. Forest ecosystems of the basin are considered from the viewpoint of preservation and restoration of small rivers. The ability of forest to accumulate solid precipitation and intercept them during the snowmelt for a longer time reduces the surface drainage and promotes transfer into the subsurface flow, significantly influencing the water content of permanent watercourses, is shown. The state of <b>protective</b> forest <b>plantations</b> in Aley river basin is analyzed. Aley river tributaries are compared by area, the length of water flow, and forest coverage of the basin. It is proposed to regulate the runoff through drastic actions on the increase of forest cover in the plain and especially in the mountainous parts of the basin. Measures to increase the forest cover within water protection zones, afforestation of temporary and permanent river basins, and the protection of agricultural soil fertility are worked out...|$|R
40|$|The {{materials}} {{on the study}} of the characteristics of pathologies common in the <b>protective</b> forest <b>plantations</b> are presented. The basic factors of deterioration of woody species pathological conditions are identified. The most common and harmful diseases of the major tree species of the Lower and Middle Volga region are determined. The comparative tolerance of systematic structure of the main forest-forming species to diseases are revealed. The complex research of modern pathological condition of trees and shrubs agroforestry plantations in the steppe and dry steppe regions of Lower and Middle Volga is carried out. Arid climate and harsh growing conditions contribute to the weakening of the stability of trees and shrubs and the deterioration of the pathological state plantations. Abnormal weather conditions (high temperatures, insufficiency or lack of precipitation, strong winds, hot winds), careless use of fire were the reason of forest plantations death. The varying degrees of resistance to pathogens among systematic composition rocks of artificial planting: elm, poplar, birch, ash, maple and others are revealed. The diseases of various etiologies, aggressiveness and severity leading to partial or complete loss of epiphytotics are identified. The most harmful are the vascular pathology (Dutch elm disease, Verticillium of maple), necrotic and cancerous disease of poplar, rot, bacterial diseases. The Middle Volga region Submucusracemosa is the most immune to pathogens, but Ribesaureum is quite resistant to anthracnose and powdery mildew, meanwhile it is subject to Verticillium wilt (Fungi of the genus Verticillium). In the Lower Volga region Cotinuscoggygria and Loniceratatarica are resistant to pathogens. Ribesaureum is subject to anthracnose and Verticillium wilt, on the branches of shadberry necrosis sore meets. Leaves of pea tree suffer from Septoria and rust, branch necrosis and cancer. The use of more sustainable, fast-growing species, hybrids and forms of woody plants affects the improvement of ecological conditions of nearby location and proves to be a more effective measure than the recovery of perishing trees...|$|R

The aim of {{this article}} is {{deepening}} the theoretical and methodological foundations for the formation of the marketing system of forest and ecosystem goods and services with the definition of their evaluation. The results of the analysis. Analysis of theoretical and methodological foundations of the marketing system of ecosystem goods and services in the forestry allowed to outline the key conclusions:understanding the forest ecosystem biogeocoenoses and content base of the ecosystem forest management; ecosystem services are mainly associated with the implementation of environmental and social functions of forests (particularly, biodiversity and recreation development); ecosystem services are associated with the acquisition of a natural object as ecosystem service; ecosystem goods and services are identified with specific work related to the protection (preservation) and reproduction of natural resources and environmental capacity with increasing the forest reproduction. It is determined that the main objective of environmentally oriented social marketing in the field of forestry is drawing the attention of government, business and non-profit organizations and other stakeholders (stakeholders, including population and new forest owners) to solve ecological, economic and social problems of effective exploitation, reproduction and preservation of forest resources on the innovative foundation. It should be noted that environmental marketing as a system of forestry regulation of the forest entrepreneurship and sale of forest goods (services) on environmental and economic grounds can be represented also in the form of environmental and economic mechanism of marketing management in the forestry. It is also revealed that marketing of ecosystem goods and services in the forestry and development of environmentally oriented social marketing meet the requirements of social responsibility of the wood production, development of economic mechanism of the forest management on the ecological and economic foundations. Principles and methodical positions for setting the prices of creation of <b>protective</b> forest <b>plantations,</b> which have the character of ecosystem goods and services and provide the development of appropriate business initiatives and the possibility of formation of the social environmental fund of the forest resources reproduction at the enterprise level, have been investigated in this paper. The upper level of prices for the creation of antierosion and shelterbelt plantings which have the character of ecosystem production has been determined in the range of 19, 419 25, 748 UAH/ha. Conclusions and directions of further researches. System of environmentally oriented social marketing and its main task of drawing attention of all stakeholders for solving environmental-economic and social problems of effective exploitation, reproduction and preservation of forest resources in conditions of socially responsible forest management have been considered in this article.
