5|$|In March 1994, the Spanish Ministry of Defense created Programa Coraza 2000 (Program Breastplate 2000), {{which focused}} on the <b>procurement</b> and {{integration}} of new armament for the Spanish army's modernization. The program included the Leopard2E and the Pizarro infantry combat vehicle, {{as well as the}} Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter. The program's scope extended to the integration of 108 Leopard2A4s, which were leased to Spain in late 1995. Apart from <b>procurement,</b> Programa Coraza was meant to prepare the Spanish army logistically for the introduction of new matériel.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{examines the}} political business cycle at public <b>procurements,</b> which were submitted by 13 regional {{authorities in the}} Czech Republic from September 2004 till June 2010. Two hypotheses are tested here. According the first one, the incumbents try to increase the probability of re-election by visible investments, e. g. public <b>procurements</b> for buildings. The second hypothesis supposes that the incumbents are afraid of not being re-elected. Therefore they strive for maximizing their personal profit from the office. Regression analysis is used for testing. Public <b>procurements</b> for buildings are tested separately from public <b>procurements</b> for goods and services. The number of public <b>procurements,</b> total amount and {{the average number of}} bidders are tested for each group of public <b>procurements.</b> The result is a detection of different motives in different parts of political business cycle...|$|R
40|$|This Master´s {{thesis is}} dealing with small scale public <b>procurements.</b> Small scale public <b>procurements</b> are a specific {{category}} of government contracts since they not as rigorously regulated by law as the sub-limit and over-the-limit contracts. The analysis {{is dealing with}} small scale public <b>procurements</b> in selected communities, specifically it studies {{the ratio of the}} value of small scale public contracts and the total value of public contracts. The analysis is extended with an example of two selected cities. In the final section, a regression analysis is conducted, which, similarly to previous chapters, studies the relation between small scale public <b>procurements</b> and population of selected municipalities...|$|R
5|$|As part of Lockheed's submission, {{the firm}} offered a formal {{guarantee}} of a 20 per cent workshare on all future export sales of its Orion 2000 while simultaneously lobbying for the United States Navy to also procure the type. Loral {{stated that it}} believed that its bid to refurbish stored P-3s was the most cost-effective submission; however, there was public controversy over whether Loral possessed the necessary technical information on the airframe, claims to which Loral strongly refuted. In May 1996, {{it was reported that}} bidders were considering self-funding their own early development costs in order to compensate for alleged funding shortfalls within the MoD's <b>procurement</b> budget; it was claimed that these funding shortfalls were due to differences between the original specification, which had envisioned as an off-the-shelf <b>procurement</b> without much in terms of development, and the increasingly extensive nature that the programme had progressively taken on.|$|E
5|$|Constable Hanks {{reported}} {{the matter to}} his superiors and the case was given to Detective Inspector Frederick Abberline. Inspector Abberline went to the brothel on 6 July with a warrant to arrest Hammond and Newlove for violation of Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. The Act made all homosexual acts between men, as well as <b>procurement</b> or attempted <b>procurement</b> of such acts, punishable by up to two years' imprisonment with or without hard labour. He found the house locked and Hammond gone, but Abberline was able to apprehend Newlove at his mother's house in Camden Town. In the time between his statement to Hanks and his arrest, Newlove had gone to Cleveland Street and warned Hammond, who had consequently escaped to his brother's house in Gravesend.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to reveal {{whether there is a}} relation between public <b>procurements</b> and the political business cycle in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic. The examined data cover a period from the year 2005 to 2011. Two hypotheses have been set in order to discover whether there is such a relation. The first one postulates that the public <b>procurements</b> are used on constructions, well visible investments, so as to increase the probability of being re-elected. The second hypothesis marks the effort of politicians to maximize their own benefits till the end of electoral term as the main reason for contracting public <b>procurements.</b> The hypotheses are proved separately for constructions and for supplies and services by the number of public <b>procurements,</b> the total amount of money spent on public <b>procurements</b> in a particular term, by average amount of bids and by the relate of the end and assumed price. The regression analysis was used as a tool of verification. The result is a determination if it is possible to find such a relation dependance of public <b>procurements</b> and political business cycle in Prague and what is assumed to be the main motive...|$|R

This result is robust even after we control for various factors, including government regulation on the local <b>procurements,</b> agglomeration effects, and unobservable firm heterogeneity. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper models {{liberalization}} of government <b>procurements</b> as admitting entry of foreign firms {{in a contest}} among potential rent seekers. It {{contributes to the literature}} on how institutions influence socially desirable outcomes. Liberalizing <b>procurements</b> reduces wasteful domestic lobbying but also increases the likelihood that a foreign firm will capture the rent. A main result is that the domestic welfare change is not monotonic in the foreign firms' abilities. Furthermore, we show that domestic liberalization policies can be inefficient from the global point of view because foreign lobbying costs can outweight productive efficiency.

5|$|The Army also {{conducted}} a weapons demonstration for the Senate Armed Services Committee in early 1972, {{to show off}} the Cheyenne's firepower and garner support for attack helicopter development. The first TOW missile that was fired in the demonstration failed and went into the ground. The second missile was fired and hit the target. Previously, 130 TOW missiles had been fired without failure, but the failure of the first missile was now linked to perception of the aircraft. In April 1972, the Senate published its report on CAS. The report recommended funding of the Air Force's A-X program, which would become the A-10 Thunderbolt II, and limited <b>procurement</b> of the Harrier for the Marine Corps. The report never referred to the Cheyenne by name and only offered a lukewarm recommendation for the Army to continue <b>procurement</b> of attack helicopters, so long as their survivability could be improved.|$|E
