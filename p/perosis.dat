40|$|SCOTT (1950), {{reported}} that the oc-currence of enlarged hocks at 2 to 4 weeks of age in turkey poults increased the incidence of leg weakness or <b>perosis</b> in ma-ture turkeys. Later, Scott (1953) demon-strated that the addition of 30 mg. of niacin and 5 mg. of alpha tocopheryl ace-tate per pound of feed completely prevented the early condition. Also, {{the addition of the}} same level of alpha tocopheryl acetate and 20 mg. of niacin per pound to the de-veloping ration prevented the mature leg condition in turkeys that showed a high in-cidence of the leg abnormalities as poults. Single supplementation of niacin or alpha tocopheryl acetate to the developing diet had no beneficial effect. Slinger et al.

Four hundred eighty 7 -d-old male White Pekin ducks were randomly allotted to ten dietary treatments, each containing 6 replicate pens with 8 birds per pen. At 28 d of age, weight gain, feed intake, and feed/gain were measured and the legs of all ducks from each pen were examined for incidence of <b>perosis.</b> <b>Perosis</b> and growth depression were observed in choline-deficient ducks and supplementation of choline reduced <b>perosis</b> and significantly increased weight gain and feed intake regardless of dietary methionine levels (p< 0. 05). In addition, significant positive effects of dietary methionine supplementation on weight gain, feed intake, and feed/gain were observed at any choline level (p< 0. 05). Supplementation of 1, 743 mg/kg choline in diets alleviated the depression of weight gain and feed intake caused by methionine deficiency at 0. 28 % methionine level. The interaction between choline and methionine influenced weight gain and feed intake of ducks (p< 0. 05). At 0. 28 % methionine level, 1, 743 mg/kg choline group caused 4. 92 % and 3. 23 % amount of improvement in weight gain and feed intake compared with 1, 239 mg/kg choline group, respectively. According to the broken-line regression, the choline requirements of starter Pekin ducks for weight gain and feed intake were 1, 472 and 1, 424 mg/kg at 0. 28 % methionine level and 946 and 907 mg/kg at 0. 48 % methionine level, respectively. It suggested the choline recommendations of starter Pekin ducks on a semi-purified diet were 1448 mg/kg at 0. 28 % methionine level and 927 mg/kg at 0. 48 % methionine level, respectively.

Assay of the enzyme by using an exogenous xylose acceptor showed no difference in xylosyltransferase activity between control and manganese-deficient tissue. Further, the extent of xylose incorporation was greater in manganese-deficient than in control cartilage preparations, suggesting an increase in xylose-acceptor sites on the endogenous acceptor protein in the deficient cartilage. 35 S turnover in the manganese-deficient cartilage was also increased. The data suggest that the decreased glycosaminoglycan content in manganese-deficient cartilage is due to decreased xylosylation of the acceptor protein plus increased degradation of glycosaminoglycan...|$|E
40|$|NIACIN (nicotinic acid) is of extreme, {{importance}} in nutrition.

40|$|IN RECENT years much {{research}} has been done to determine the qualitative and quantitative requirements of manga-nese in poultry nutrition. It seems to be an established fact that manganese is essen-tial in the prevention of <b>perosis</b> as shown by Wilgus, Norris, and Heuser (1936), in normal embryonic development as shown by Lyons and Insko (1937), and by young chicks for maintenance and normal bone formation as shown by Van der Horn, Bra-nion, and Graham (1938). But it is not yet quite clear what the role of manganese is in adult fowls, and what is the effect of some variations in the manganese content of the rations on laying hens, their produc-tion, and on the egg quality. Gallup and Norris (1939) reported that a deficiency of manganese in the diet of hens resulted in low egg production, high mortality of embryos, and decreased fertility, but this was observed when the ration contained 13 parts per million (milligrams per kilo-gram) of manganese. Lyons (1935) ob-served that poor egg shell quality resulted when the ration contained 7 p. p. m. of man-ganese. On the other hand, however, the com-mercial rations for laying hens usually con-tain 31 to 76 p. p. m. of manganese, with an average of 40 - 50 p. p. m. according to Smith (1938), which is much above the level pointed out as deficient by the authors cited...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} and isolation of choline by Strecker in 1849, many workers have devoted {{much time to}} the study of this important compound. The importance of choline as a portion of the lecithin molecule, has been known for some time, {{but it was not until}} after {{the discovery}} of insulin that choline came to be recognized as an essential constituent of the diet. While discussing the physiological aspects of choline, McHenry (31) states that it may function in at least three ways: “to stimulate the formation of phospholipids, to make possible the production of acetylcholine and to supply labile methyl groups”. In addition to the development of fatty livers, various other results of a deficiency of choline have been reported. Rats not receiving sufficient choline lose hair and have red swollen paws. A choline deficiency in young male rats was found to result in the formation of hemorrhagic kidneys and renal lesions. Choline also appears to be essential for normal lactation in the rat. In poultry, the role that choline plays in <b>perosis</b> has been widely studied. A choline deficiency may result in an inadequate formation of acetylcholine at the nerve endings and hence interfere with the transmittance of nerve impulses. The nutritional value of choline in the diet would indicate that a rapid, chemical method for its determination is of the utmost importance...|$|E
40|$|CHOLINE is {{important}} in nutrition because of the roles that it plays in liver fat metabolism (Best and Hunts-man, 1932) and in transmethylation reactions occurring in the body (du Vigneaud et al., 1939). A deficiency of choline in the diet of the chick or the turkey poult causes <b>perosis</b> (Jukes, 1940, 1941). Eggs {{are considered to be}} one of the richest sources of choline, which occurs almost entirely in the yolk. Nott-bohm and Mayer as quoted by Grossfeld (1938) analyzed six egg yolks which con-tained 9. 58 - 11. 60 mg. of choline per gm. Engel (1943) found 17. 13 mg. choline per gm. of fresh egg yolk, or, assuming an average yolk weight of 18 gm., one egg would contain 306 mg. of choline. Ring-rose and Davis (1946) analyzed eggs from hens on diets containing different levels of choline and obtained values from 10. 4 to 15. 3 mg. per gm. of egg yolk (187 to 276 mg. per egg assuming a yolk weight of 18 gm.). Eggs undergo a number of readily ob-served changes during cold storage, but little is known of the chemical changes taking place.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Ten {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the vitamin requirements of coturnix quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) to 2 weeks of age using a glucose monohydrate-isolated soybean protein diet. A preliminary study consisting of 2 separate experiments was conducted to determine those vitamins essential to the growing coturnix. This study revealed that young coturnix suffered 100 percent mortality when thiamine, pantothenic acid and pyridoxine were not added to the basal diet. Mortality rates of 46, 80 and 67 percent were observed when diets were deficient in vitamins A and D₃ and riboflavin, respectively. Mortality rates from lack of the remaining vitamins were not considered excessive or abnormal. Feathering was adversely affected and growth was depressed from a deficiency of vitamin A, vitamin D₃, riboflavin, niacin and choline. Omission of supplemental vitamin E, vitamin K, para-aminobenzoic acid, folacin, biotin, inositol or vitamin B₁₂ from the diet appeared without effect under the conditions of this study. Using growth, mortality and feathering as the primary criteria, minimum requirements were established for vitamin A, vitamin D₃, thiamine, riboflavin and pantothenic acid. The requirements per kg. of diet were as follows: vitamin A (I. U.) > 550 but 499 but 1. 1 but 2. 37 but 13. 3 but < 16. 3. Vitamin A and D₃ deficient young quail developed deficiency symptoms similar to those reported for chicks and poults. The vitamin A deficient quail showed decreased growth, incoordination of movement, poor feathering and high mortality. The vitamin D₃ deficient quail were rachitic. The thiamine deficient quail suffered poor growth and high mortality, but no polyneuritis was observed. While there was no curled-toe paralysis observed in the riboflavin deficient quail, they failed to grow juvenile feathers.

40|$|The author’s intent {{for this}} study was to begin with a careful review of the {{published}} literature concerning the manganese requirement and manganese interactions in poultry feeding. When the review was finished, experiments were designed and conducted to obtain more precise data and conclusions on the young turkey’s requirement for manganese. The role of manganese in the prevention of <b>perosis</b> and certain manganese interactions were also considered in this research. The specific objectives of this investigation were: (1) to determine the quantitative requirements of manganese for young turkeys, 0 - 4 weeks of age, (2) to study the effects of manganese and manganese interactions on growth and hock development of turkey poults, (3) to study the need for supplemental manganese in practical corn-soybean meal diets for young turkeys. Five experiments were conducted with day-old Broad Breasted Bronze turkeys. Four of the experiments were of four weeks duration, while experiment III was continued to eight weeks. Straight-run poults were used in experiments I, III, and V; female poults were used in experiments II and IV. In each experiment the poults were selected at random, wingbanded, weighed and assigned to dietary treatments. The birds were maintained in electrically heated battery brooders on raised wire floors. The experimental diets and water were supplied ad libitum. Individual body weights were recorded at weekly intervals. The feed consumption of birds assigned to each dietary treatment was determined at the termination of experiments I, II, III, and V. Samples of the basal diet from all experiments were analyzed for manganese content. The basal diets used in experiments II and V were also analyzed for zinc and sodium content. The analyses of the diets from the first four experiments were run by the Calcium Carbonate Company, Quincy, Illinois.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} research achievements on the breeding, feed, {{and nutrition}} of Japanese quail {{performed at the}} Laboratory of Animal Genetics and Breeding, Department of Agriculture, Okayama University, between 1973 and 2008. 　The study included analysis of inbreeding depression and heterosis, which are important subjects in breeding. Secondly, the genetic parameters useful for selection were identified and the sexing of newborn chicks utilizing sex-linked inheritance was investigated. As problems related to feed and nutrition, the reduced excretion of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), the utilization of a cochineal residue, {{and the effects of}} red salmon astaxanthin, palm oil, and astaxanthin supplementation on eggs functions were investigated. 　In quail, inbreeding depression was noted in overall productive characters, and the depression was marked in reproductive characters, such as hatchability. The genetic load was calculated using the equation: －logeS＝A＋BF. On crossbreeding between highly inbred lines of Japanese quail, marked heterosis was noted in the hatchability, viability, and egg production rate. 　Analysis of early embryonic development showed that the number of mitotic cells, mitotic index, and 3 H-thymidine and 3 H-uridine uptakes were lower in the inbred embryos compared with those of hybrid embryos, indicating important metabolic differences. 　Basic information for the selective breeding of quail, heritability of characters, such as the body weight, muscle mass, skeleton, and egg characteristics were accumulated; accumulated information suggested the possibility of selective breeding with regard to these characters. 　Sexing of newborn quail chicks utilizing sex-linked inheritance was performed. Mating males of the brown line and females of the normal line, all male chicks had normal plumage colors, whereas all females had brown plumage colors, which allowed simple sexing. The supplementation of low-CP feed with essential amino acids and low-CP, low-P feed with phytase improved the growth of chicks, increased the egg production rate, and reduced N and P excretions. Phytase supplementation enhanced tibial growth in the early growth period, and reduced <b>perosis</b> and the mortality of chicks. When female chicks were fed a cochineal residue at 6 weeks of age, the egg production rate was similar to that of chicks fed fish meal, showing the possibility of substitution with fish meal. 　The yolk color was improved by supplementation with red salmon astaxanthin, palm oil, and astaxanthin. The yolk color improved with increases in the supplemented amounts of palm oil and astaxanthin. Astaxanthin added to feed was transferred to the egg yolk, and the antioxidative capacity improved as the amount added increased. 　To further clarify the characteristics of quail as experimental animals, and to improve their productivity as livestock, a continuation in both basic and applied research is indispensable...|$|E
