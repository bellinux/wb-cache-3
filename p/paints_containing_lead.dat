In some countries, lead continues to be added to paint intended for domestic use, whereas countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. have regulations prohibiting this, although lead paint may still be found in older properties painted prior to the introduction of such regulations. Although lead has been banned from household paints in the United States since 1978, paint used in road markings may still contain it. Alternatives such as water-based, lead-free traffic paint are readily available, and many states and federal agencies have changed their purchasing contracts to buy these instead.|$|R

Histological review performed by a reference pathologist left 99 cases for study; 84 cases and 2070 population controls were interviewed. The industries most closely associated (a twofold or more odds ratio [OR]) with SBC taking into account a 10 -year time lag after exposure were, among women, employment in wholesale industry of food and beverages (OR, 8. 2; 95 % confidence interval [CI], [1. 9 to 34. 9]) and among men, manufacture of motor vehicle bodies (OR, 5. 2; 95 % CI, 1. 2 to 22. 4), footwear (OR, 3. 9 : 95 % CI, 0. 9 to 16. 1), and metal structures (OR, 3. 3; 95 % CI, 1. 0 to 10. 4).

A removal site evaluation was conducted at nine areas associated with the BSF. The scope of each evaluation included (1) a search for, and review of, readily available historical records regarding operations {{and use of the}} facility (including hazardous substance usage and existing contamination); (2) interviews with facility personnel concerning current and past practices; and (3) a brief walk-through to visually inspect the facility and identify existing hazard areas requiring maintenance actions or remedial evaluation. The results of the removal site evaluation indicate that no substantial risks exist from contaminants present because adequate efforts are being made to contain and control existing contamination and hazardous substances and to protect human health and the environment. At Building 3004, deteriorated and peeling exterior paint has a direct pathway to the storm water drainage system and can potentially impact local surface water during periods of storm water runoff. The paint is assumed to be lead based, thus posing a potential problem. The paint should be sampled and analyzed to determine its lead content and to assess whether a hazard exists. If so, a maintenance action will be necessary to prevent further deterioration and dislodging of the paint.

30|$|The {{materials}} used in Islamic paintings are discussed {{in a variety of}} historical sources, including Islamic treatises and travelers accounts. Recipes for the manufacture and use of artistsâ€™ materials in Islamic treatises have been extensively studied [1 â€“ 9]. The Persian palette was divided into six primary colors, white, yellow, red, green, blue, black, and six metal-based pigments, gold, silver, brass, copper, tin, mica [5 â€“ 7]. Of these, the inorganic materials can be separated into naturally occurring mineralsâ€”orpiment (arsenic sulfide) for yellow, cinnabar (mercuric sulfide), realgar (arsenic sulfide), and various ochres (iron oxides) for red, and lapis lazuli (ultramarine) for blueâ€”and synthetic compoundsâ€”lead white (basic lead carbonate) for white, red lead (lead tetroxide) and vermilion/cinnabar (mercuric sulfide) for red, and verdigris (copper acetate) for green. Several organic materials were also used as pigments and include those derived from plants such as rhubarb and saffron for yellow, safflower and brazil wood for red, and indigo for blue, and those produced from insects such as kermes, cochineal and lac for red. Many of the recipes mentioned mixing the pigments with gums for preparation or use.

What are the health effects of lead? How can I prevent exposure to lead? More commonly, lower levels of lead in children over time may lead to reduced IQ, slow learning, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), or behavioral issues. Lead also affects other parts of the body including the kidneys, heart, and reproductive system, Pregnant women should know that the developing fetus is very sensitive to the effects of lead exposure. The effects of lead may be seen right away or may not be noticed for many years. Make sure that your home is lead safe. If your house was built before 1978 and you cannot afford to have all the lead-based paint eliminated from it, please follow these tips: o Make sure that the paint is not chipping or peeling. Pay special attention to the paint around windows, porches, and doors. o Use lead-safe work practices when doing any remodeling work that causes paint to chip, peel or become dust.

30|$|Lead {{pigments}} are {{not suitable}} for use in fresco, {{but they were still}} used due to their good hiding properties and to the low prices compared to other pigments [5, 123, 200, 211 â€“ 213]. The degradation processes of the various Pb pigments yield a range of compounds which cause discolouration, strongly affecting the readability of the polychromy [200]. Lead pigments on ceramic artefacts are sensitive to sulphur containing pollutants, to acidic solutions (rain; CO 2; microbial activity), to light and air: anglesite PbSO 4, cerussite PbCO 3, hydrocerussite 2 PbCO 3 Â·Pb(OH) 2 and lead sulphide PbS are formed [166]. Anglesite, attributed to lead pigment degradation was identified on wall paintings as well [214]. To laser irradiation, reduction of the lead compounds (leadwhite, massicot, red lead) occurs on the surface, so that the dark colour is attributed to formation of metallic lead, or Pb 2 O [150]. The subsequent oxidation of lead explains the reversibility of such a colour change [150]. The temperature increase related to the laser irradiation causes the formation of massicot on both minium and leadwhite [150]. Care needs to be taken when a laser source is used for analytical purposes, such as during Raman spectroscopic investigations, as the lead pigments and their degradation products, such as PbO 2 and PbS, might be altered, affecting the interpretation of the degraded areas [215, 216]. All lead pigments turned black after exposure to H 2 S vapours (formation of galena, PbS), with increasing reactivity for basic moieties, such as Pb(OH) 2 units in leadwhite [124]. It is reported that biological colonization on wall paintings can selectively affect lead (II) compounds, causing brown discolourations identified as PbO 2 or PbS [211, 217], while copper pigments act as biocides [124, 212]. Lead dioxide formation is favoured in humid alkaline conditions, such as in frescoes, when peroxides are produces, either by microorganisms or by photo-oxidation of organic materials [213]. When exposed to salt solutions, and light, the most stable phase for all the lead pigments is cerussite [123, 200, 218]. In oil, lead compounds were not only used as pigments, but as siccatives as well [219, 220]. Moreover, lead soaps are formed in, or on the surface of, oil <b>paint</b> layers <b>containing</b> <b>lead</b> based pigments (leadwhite, lead tin yellow type I, litharge, red lead) and are investigated as they affect the appearance of paintings [54, 55, 107, 145, 219 â€“ 228].
