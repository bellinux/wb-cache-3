40|$|Abstract: <b>Pedigree</b> <b>selection</b> was practiced on two {{bread wheat}} populations, namely i. e. (Debeira x Sahel 1) as {{considered}} population I and (Sids 6 x Sahel 1) as considered population II. Experiments were conducted under drought stress conditions (at 12 % soil moisture content) {{in order to}} improve yield and its component traits (no. of spikes / plant, biological yield, grain yield / plant and 1000 -grain weight). Variance analysis revealed that all F 3 families in both populations were highly significantly affected by soil moisture content. Also, significant or highly significant differences were found among families in both F 4 and F 5 generations for two populations, except no. of spikes/plant in F 4 generation in both populations, also biological yield/plant and grain yield/plant in F 5 generation in population I, and also no. of spikes/plant in F 5 generation in population II. Results showed that broad sense heritability estimates were low to moderately in F 3 generation for both populations. Also, estimates of broad sense heritability (B. S. H) ranged from low to moderate /high for both F 4 and F 5 generations in two populations. Moderately differences were found between phenotypic and genotypic variability estimates (p. c. v.) and (g. c. v.) for all the three generations in both populations.

Three varieties were used as a female parent (Briscard, Carifen 12 and Rescler) and two as a male component (Francuska and PKB-Prelivka). Descendents in F 2 generation were produced from 6 F 1 hybrids (3 x 2). Selection after F 2 generation were undertaken from 1996 to 1999, while in 2000 the field experiments with complete breeding material were set up at the Institute 'PKB INI Agroekonomik' in Padinska Skela near Belgrade.

40|$|A {{review study}} on maize hybrid and inbred line {{productivity}} and stability, {{in an effort}} to overcome stagnation by developing more efficient breeding strategies. Data presented here, refer to maize hybrid and inbred line yields, under high and low plant populations, which depict the need for incorporation of favourable additive gene action in the genetic materials, under <b>pedigree</b> line <b>selection</b> schemes evaluating per se performance. Additionally, low populations during the first stages of selection, contribute to more reliable evaluation of favourable genotypes. Data reveal that inbred lines are capable to reach hybrid performance and consequently, replace single hybrids as the end-products for farmer use. As far as the yielding capacity of inbred parents improves, the less the yield in F 1 is favored by heterozygosity. Other products, such as three-way crosses with lower level of heterozygosity, may be more efficient and stable than single hybrids and more readily developed. These products depend their productivity on additive gene action. Stability and uniformity of performance of three-way crosses is depended on high and stable inbred line performance. In general, these breeding strategies may lead to more stable end-products, density independent and with satisfactory yielding performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the response to direct selection for grain yield/plant under normal and water stress conditions and study the correlated response of other studied traits. Two cycles of <b>pedigree</b> <b>selection</b> for grain yield/plant were practiced on a segregating population of wheat (Giza 168 xSids 1) in the F 3 -F 5 generations. Selection was practiced separately and over environments, at normal irrigation environment and drought stress irrigation environment. After the second cycle, the F 5 - selected families were evaluated at the two environments. <b>Pedigree</b> <b>selection</b> for the two cycles at each environment showed 25. 00 and 25. 54 % increase in grain yield/plant over the bulk samples for normal and drought stress selections, respectively, compared to 22. 60 % for selections over environments. The antagonistic selection was more efficient than synergistic selection in changing the mean. Selection for grain yield/plant was accompanied by late in heading date of 1. 76, 4. 07 and 0. 13 %, increase in plant height of 13. 09, 9. 79 and 7. 38 % and with decrease in 1000 -grain weight of - 2. 01, - 2. 02 and - 4. 31 % over the bulk sample when selection was practiced under normal, drought stress and over environments, respectively.

40|$|Germplasm {{collections}} are valuable gene pools providing diverse genetic material {{that may be}} applied {{for the improvement of}} cultivars and advanced agronomic productivity. An assessment of genetic diversity in crop germplasm collections can assist in the choice of parents for genetic mapping populations and subsequent marker-assisted selection. Genotyping individuals and cultivars within germplasm collections can help breeders narrow the search for new alleles at loci of interest and assist in the identification of ‘perfect’ marker alleles from candidate genes that can then be introduced into new varieties along with their associated desirable traits. Genotypic information from germplasm collections can be used to assign lines and populations to heterotic groups; to study the evolutionary history of wild relatives; to verify pedigrees and fill in the gaps in incomplete <b>pedigree</b> or <b>selection</b> history and to monitor changes in allele frequencies in cultivars or populations. Towards the application of genetic diversity analysis to germplasm improvement, we have characterised within and between line genetic diversity in an international germplasm collection, consisting of over 100 B. napus and B. juncea lines, using genomic and EST (expressed sequence tag) derived Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) molecular markers.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the mode of gene action involved in some okra economic traits, three different crosses as started genetic materials were used for this purpose applying generation mean analysis. Significant differences for all studied traits for six populations P 1, P 2, F 1, F 2, BC 1 and BC 2 within each cross were found indicating the existence of genetic variation and possibility of selection for these traits. Insignificant negative or positive heterosis and inbreeding depression were registered in most crosses for all studied traits except in plant height. Additive-dominance model was adequate to demonstrate the genetic variation and it is important in the inheritance for weight of 100 seeds, fruit diameter, fruit length and total yield per plant traits. While, non-allelic interactions were found in the other traits for most crosses. The dominancexdominance effects were greater than additivexadditive and additivexdominance, when non-additive portion is larger than additive in most cases which recorded non-allelic interaction. Phenotypic Coefficients of Variation (PCV) was higher than Genotypic Coefficients of Variation (GCV) for all traits indicating sensitivity of studied traits to the environmental conditions. GCV, PCV, heritability and expected Genetic advance GA% of mean in most crosses were found high or moderately high.

40|$|Having found {{evidence}} for segregation {{at a major}} locus for a quantitative trait, a logical {{next step is to}} identify those pedigrees in which major-locus segregation is occurring. If the quantitative trait is a risk factor for an associated disease, identifying such segregating pedigrees can be important in classifying families by etiology, in risk assessment, and in suggesting treatment modalities. Identifying segregating pedigrees can also be helpful in selecting pedigrees to include in a subsequent linkage study to map the major locus. Here, we describe a strategy to identify pedigrees segregating at a major locus for a quantitative trait. We apply this <b>pedigree</b> <b>selection</b> strategy to simulated data generated under a major-locus or mixed model with a rare dominant allele and sampled according to one of several fixed-structure or sequential sampling designs. We demonstrate that for the situations considered, the <b>pedigree</b> <b>selection</b> strategy is sensitive and specific and that a linkage study based only on the pedigrees classified as segregating extracts essentially all the linkage information in the entire sample of pedigrees. Our results suggest that for large-scale linkage studies involving many genetic markers, the savings from this strategy can be substantial and that, compared with fixed-structure sampling, sequential sampling of pedigrees can greatly improve the efficiency for linkage analysis of a quantitative trait...|$|E

This breed was used for guarding the Czechoslovakian borders {{during the cold war}} and is currently kept by civilian breeders all round the world. The aim of our study was to characterize, for the first time, the genetic composition of this breed in relation to its known source populations. We sequenced the hypervariable part of the mtDNA control region and genotyped the Amelogenin gene, four sex-linked microsatellites and 39 autosomal microsatellites in 79 Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs, 20 German Shepherds and 28 Carpathian wolves. We performed a range of population genetic analyses based on both empirical and simulated data. Only two mtDNA and two Y-linked haplotypes were found in Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs. Both mtDNA haplotypes were of domestic origin, while only one of the Y-haplotypes was shared with German Shepherds and the other was unique to Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs. The observed inbreeding coefficient was low despite the small effective population size of the breed, possibly due to heterozygote advantages determined by introgression of wolf alleles. Moreover, Czechoslovakian Wolfdog genotypes were distinct from both parental populations, indicating the role of founder effect, drift and/or genetic hitchhiking.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Commercial pig {{producers}} generally use {{a terminal}} crossbreeding system with three breeds. Many pig breeding organisations {{have started to}} use genomic selection for which genetic evaluation is often done by applying single-step methods for which the pedigree-based additive genetic relationship matrix {{is replaced by a}} combined relationship matrix based on both marker genotypes and <b>pedigree.</b> Genomic <b>selection</b> is implemented for purebreds, but it also offers opportunities for incorporating information from crossbreds and selecting for crossbred performance. However, models for genetic evaluation for the three-way crossbreeding system have not been developed. [br/] RESULTS: Four-variate models for three-way terminal crossbreeding are presented in which the first three variables contain the records for the three pure breeds and the fourth variable contains the records for the three-way crossbreds. For purebred animals, the models provide breeding values for both purebred and crossbred performances. Heterogeneity of genetic architecture between breeds and genotype by environment interactions are modelled through genetic correlations between these breeding values. Specification of the additive genetic relationships is essential for these models and can be defined either within populations or across populations. Based on these two types of additive genetic relationships, both pedigree-based, marker-based and combined relationships based on both pedigree and marker information are presented. All these models for three-way crossbreeding can be formulated using Kronecker matrix products and therefore fitted using Henderson's mixed model equations and standard animal breeding software. [br/] CONCLUSIONS: Models for genetic evaluation in the three-way crossbreeding system are presented. They provide estimated breeding values for both purebred and crossbred performances, and can use pedigree-based or marker-based relationships, or combined relationships based on both pedigree and marker information.

Plants produce 3 - 4 candle-shaped panicles with large grains (11 - 12 g 1000 -grain weight) and grey colour. Line 843 A is the seed parent of early-maturing hybrid HHB 67...|$|E
40|$|Selection in {{breeding}} {{programs can}} be done by using phenotypes (phenotypic <b>selection),</b> <b>pedigree</b> relationship (breeding value selection) or molecular markers (marker assisted selection or genomic selection). All these methods are based on truncation selection, focusing on the best performance of parents before mating. In this article we proposed an approach to breeding, named genomic mating, which focuses on mating instead of truncation selection. Genomic mating uses information in a similar fashion to genomic selection but includes information on complementation of parents to be mated. Following the efficiency frontier surface, genomic mating uses concepts of estimated breeding values, risk (usefulness) and coefficient of ancestry to optimize mating between parents. We used a genetic algorithm to find solutions to this optimization problem and the results from our simulations comparing genomic selection, phenotypic selection and the mating approach indicate that current approach for breeding complex traits is more favorable than phenotypic and genomic selection. Genomic mating is similar to genomic selection in terms of estimating marker effects, but in genomic mating the genetic information and the estimated marker effects are used to decide which mates should be crossed to obtain the next breeding population...|$|R
40|$|Although {{host plant}} rcsistance in sorghum was denlonstrated as carly as 1920 both in Africa and India, its {{exploitation}} it 1 breeding broad-spectrum stablc resistant cultivars started only recently. In pearl millet, however, the cxistcncc of host plant resistance {{is not yet}} clearly demonstrated. Striga-resistant sorghum varieties are in general agronomically poor. Multi-locational evaluation in Africa revealed that Framida ahd N 1 3 are the most stable rcsistant varieties. These two varieties were resistant to both S. asiatica and S-. herm-onthica. Some of the varieties like Najjadh, 12610 C and IS 9830 revealed a narrow spectrum of rcsistance when tcsted across different seed samples of S. hcrmonthica. Ccnetic analysis of field rcsistancc in sorghum revealed that it is controlled predominantly by additive genc action and thus straight selection is effective. A pedigree approach to transfer resistance into elite agronomic backgrounds was successful. Several sclcctions with promising levels 01 resist nce, stablc grain yiclds and good grain quality wcre identified and arc now in 'on farm' tests. In millet, a few less susceptible lincs have been identified. Intercrossing them and following the <b>pedigree</b> system of <b>selection</b> resulted in increased levels of rcsistancc and grain yields, The need for integrated Striga rnanagemcnt, ncluding resistant cultivars and complementary agronomic control practices, is cmphasised...|$|R
40|$|A dataset was {{simulated}} {{and distributed}} to participants of the QTLMAS XII workshop who {{were invited to}} develop genomic selection models. Each contributing group was asked to describe the model development and validation {{as well as to}} submit genomic predictions for three generations of individuals, for which they only knew the genotypes. The organisers used these genomic predictions to perform the final validation by comparison to the true breeding values, which were known only to the organisers. Methods used by the 5 groups fell in 3 classes 1) fixed effects models 2) BLUP models, and 3) Bayesian MCMC based models. The Bayesian analyses gave the highest accuracies, followed by the BLUP models, while the fixed effects models generally had low accuracies and large error variance. The best BLUP models as well as the best Bayesian models gave unbiased predictions. The BLUP models are clearly sensitive to the assumed SNP variance, because they do not estimate SNP variance, but take the specified variance as the true variance. The current comparison suggests that Bayesian analyses on haplotypes or SNPs are the most promising approach for Genomic selection although the BLUP models may provide a computationally attractive alternative with little loss of efficiency. On the other hand fixed effect type models are unlikely to provide any gain over traditional <b>pedigree</b> indexes for <b>selection...</b>|$|R
