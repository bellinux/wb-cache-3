40|$|Smartphone app {{developers}} {{have to make}} many privacy-related decisions about what data to collect about endusers, and how that data is used. We explore how app developers make decisions about privacy and security. Additionally, we examine whether any privacy and security behaviors are related to characteristics of the <b>app</b> <b>development</b> <b>companies.</b> We conduct {{a series of interviews}} with 13 app developers to obtain rich qualitative information about privacy and security decision-making. We use an online survey of 228 app developers to quantify behaviors and test our hypotheses about the relationship between privacy and security behaviors and company characteristics. We find that smaller companies are less likely to demonstrate positive privacy and security behaviors. Additionally, although third-party tools for ads and analytics are pervasive, developers aren’t aware of the data collected by these tools. We suggest tools and opportunities to reduce the barriers for app developers to implement privacy and security best practices...|$|R

This study has been conducted at Scania’s Fleet Management department that offers a web-based service where haulage contractors can administer, monitor and follow up on their vehicle fleets. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate if Scania’s existing web service should be extended into the mobile area, and if so, what organizational and technical challenges <b>app</b> <b>development</b> imposes. To address this problem, a qualitative investigation was carried out with three main groups of respondents: comparable companies that have faced similar challenges, <b>app</b> <b>development</b> <b>companies</b> and the current users of the Fleet Management service. Additionally, a prototype application was developed to investigate the potential technical challenges that may occur. Combined with a theoretical framework the conducted research has led to recommendations on how to best take the step into the field of mobile devices. This study shows that it is advisable to adopt the mobile technological trend since the positive effects of an app outweigh the potential costs. The technical changes within the field of smartphones occur at a rapid rate, which requires special technical skills. The development also requires iterative development methods where the end-user is included throughout the whole process...|$|R
