25|$|Forging is a {{manufacturing}} process involving {{the shaping of}} metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a <b>power</b> <b>hammer)</b> or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of cold working), warm forging, or hot forging (a type of hot working). For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons. Forging {{has been done by}} smiths for millennia; the traditional products were kitchenware, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, and jewellery. Since the Industrial Revolution, forged parts are widely used in mechanisms and machines wherever a component requires high strength; such forgings usually require further processing (such as machining) to achieve a finished part. Today, forging is a major worldwide industry.|$|E
2500|$|One or more trip hammers {{were set}} up in a forge, also known {{variously}} as a hammer mill, hammer forge or hammer works. The hammers were usually raised by a cam and then released to fall under the force of gravity. Historically, trip hammers were often powered by a water wheel, and are known to have been used in China as long ago as 40 BC or maybe even {{as far back as the}} Zhou Dynasty (1050 BCâ€“221 BC) and in medieval Europe by the 12th century. During the Industrial Revolution the trip hammer fell out of favor and was replaced with the <b>power</b> <b>hammer.</b> [...] Often multiple hammers were powered via a set of line shafts, pulleys and belts from a centrally located power supply.|$|E
2500|$|While at T.I. Group in Edgbaston, Birmingham, Dolphin {{was awarded}} a patent for his {{invention}} of improvements {{to the design of}} roadside kerbs. The new design was described as 'particularly suitable for rapid and economical edging of country roads {{in such a way that}} the metal of the roadway is contained, spillage of dirt from the verges onto the roadway is avoided, and a drainage channel for surface water is provided.' He also patented a design for pre-fabricated multi-level roadways and one of his most important inventions, sheet pile revetments for waterways. [...] This invention has had a significant benefit for the reclamation of land in waterfront areas such as Cardiff Bay. The patent describes the solution as 'revetments or retaining walls for the banks of rivers or canals and concerns an arrangement, particularly suitable for rivers and canals which are relatively shallow at the banks, in which the revetment comprises a series of sheet metal plates arranged end-to-end and suitably secured together to form a wall of sheet metal pile sections, driven into the ground vertically by a <b>power</b> <b>hammer</b> and interlocked so that a complete wall of steel piles is provided between the bank and the water. The wall is retained by tie bars linking it to anchor plates set in the bank well inshore This system of piling is undoubtedly desirable, if not essential, for deep waterways or those subject to heavy erosion, such as tidal waters.' ...|$|E

2500|$|In modern times, {{industrial}} forging is done {{either with}} presses or with <b>hammers</b> <b>powered</b> by compressed air, electricity, hydraulics or steam. These hammers may have reciprocating weights {{in the thousands}} of pounds. Smaller <b>power</b> <b>hammers,</b> [...] or less reciprocating weight, and hydraulic presses are common in art smithies as well. Some steam hammers remain in use, but they became obsolete with {{the availability of the}} other, more convenient, power sources.|$|R
50|$|Both {{manual and}} <b>powered</b> <b>hammers</b> can cause {{peripheral}} neuropathy or {{a variety of}} other ailments when used improperly. Awkward handles can cause repetitive stress injury (RSI) to hand and arm joints, and uncontrolled shock waves from repeated impacts can injure nerves and the skeleton.|$|R
50|$|A typical <b>power</b> <b>hammer</b> {{consists}} of a frame, an anvil, and a reciprocating ram holding a hammer head or die. The workpiece {{is placed on the}} lower anvil or die and the head or upper die strikes the workpiece. The <b>power</b> <b>hammer</b> is a direct descendant of the trip hammer, differing in that the <b>power</b> <b>hammer</b> stores potential energy in an arrangement of mechanical linkages and springs, in compressed air, or steam, and {{by the fact that it}} accelerates the ram on the downward stroke. This provides more force than simply allowing the weight to fall. Predecessors like trip hammers, steam drop hammers, board or strap hammers, used the power source to raise the ram or hammer head, but let it fall solely under gravity.|$|E

50|$|Steam hammers {{proved to}} be {{invaluable}} in many industrial processes. Technical improvements gave greater control over the force delivered, greater longevity, greater efficiency and greater <b>power.</b> A steam <b>hammer</b> built in 1891 by the Bethlehem Iron Company delivered a 125-ton blow. In the 20th century steam hammers were gradually displaced in forging by mechanical and hydraulic presses, but some are still in use.

5000|$|<b>Power</b> <b>hammers</b> are {{mechanical}} forging hammers {{that use}} a non-muscular power source {{to raise the}} hammer preparatory to striking, and accelerate it onto the work being hammered. Also called [...] "Open Die Power Forging Hammers." [...] They {{have been used by}} blacksmiths, bladesmiths, metalworkers, and manufacturers since the late 1880s, having replaced trip hammers.|$|R

5000|$|The basic art and {{principles}} of forging a blade has remained similar {{for thousands of years}} and the modern bladesmith uses a variety of tools and techniques in order to produce a blade.

5000|$|A {{flywheel}} {{may also}} be used to supply intermittent pulses of energy at power levels that exceed the abilities of its energy source. This is achieved by accumulating energy in the flywheel over a period of time, at a rate that is compatible with the energy source, and then releasing energy at a much higher rate over a relatively short time when it is needed. For example, flywheels are used in <b>power</b> <b>hammers</b> and riveting machines.|$|R
50|$|The First to {{have set}} up a rolling mill not only on the railways, but {{probably}} in the country in 1870. It had 3 mills, steam driven <b>Power</b> <b>hammer,</b> fish plate machine, billet shears, the mill was driven by steam from boilers placed {{on the top of the}} furnaces and heated by gas from the furnaces.

50|$|One {{common use}} of this peening (stretching) process {{can be seen in}} the auto repair and auto custom {{fabrication}} industries where manual or machine assisted peening is used to stretch thin sheet metal to create curved surfaces. The manual method uses a hand held peening hammer and is a form of planishing. There are also machine assisted methods that use a version of a <b>power</b> <b>hammer</b> to peen the sheet metal.|$|E
50|$|An English {{wheel is}} a better tool for a skilled {{craftsman}} for low-crown applications than manually hammering. Planishing manually using dollies and slapper files or planishing hammer, after hammer forming is very labour-intensive. Using a pear shaped mallet and sandbag to stretch the sheet metal (sinking), or by raising on a stake, speeds up the fabrication of higher crown sections. A pneumatic hammer or <b>power</b> <b>hammer</b> is faster still. The English wheel is very effective when used for planishing, (for which it was originally patented in England), to a smooth final finish after these processes.|$|E
