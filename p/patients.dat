These studies generally examined a cohort of <b>patients</b> recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected <b>patients</b> who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded <b>patients</b> who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from <b>patients</b> who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the <b>patients</b> in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all <b>patients</b> regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that <b>patient</b> generates overall satisfaction with medical service and sub satisfaction {{on the basis}} of response to <b>patient's</b> trust in medical service and response to <b>patient's</b> attitude towards health policy in China. This study aimed to investigate the correlations between <b>patient's</b> trust in medical service/patient's attitude towards health policy and <b>patient's</b> overall satisfaction with medical service/sub satisfaction in current medical experience and find inspiration for future reform of China's health delivery system on improving <b>patient's</b> overall satisfaction with medical service and sub satisfaction in considering <b>patient's</b> trust in medical service and <b>patient's</b> attitude towards health policy. Methods This study collaborated with the National Bureau of Statistics to collect a sample of 3, 424 residents from 17 provinces and municipalities in a 2008 China household survey on <b>patient's</b> trust in medical service, <b>patient's</b> attitude towards health policy, <b>patient's</b> overall satisfaction and sub satisfaction in current medical experience. Results <b>Patient's</b> overall satisfaction with medical service and most kinds of sub satisfaction in current medical experience were significantly influenced by both <b>patient's</b> trust in medical service and <b>patient's</b> attitude towards health policy; among all kinds of sub satisfaction in current medical experience, <b>patient's</b> trust in medical service/patient's attitude towards health policy had the largest influence on <b>patient's</b> satisfaction with medical costs, the influences of <b>patient's</b> trust in medical service/patient's attitude towards health policy on <b>patient's</b> satisfaction with doctor-patient interaction and satisfaction with treatment process were at medium-level, <b>patient's</b> trust in medical service/patient's attitude towards health policy had the smallest influence on <b>patient's</b> satisfaction with medical facilities and hospital environment, while <b>patient's</b> satisfaction with waiting time in hospital was not influenced by <b>patient's</b> trust in medical service/patient's attitude towards health policy. Conclusion In order to improve <b>patient's</b> overall satisfaction with medical service and sub satisfaction in considering <b>patient's</b> trust in medical service and <b>patient's</b> attitude towards health policy, both improving <b>patient's</b> interpersonal trust in medical service from individual's own medical experience/public trust in medical service and improving <b>patient's</b> attitude towards health policy were indirect but effective ways. </p...|$|R

40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{evaluate}} structured <b>patient</b> assessment frameworks 2 ̆ 7 {{impact on}} <b>patient</b> care. Background: Accurate <b>patient</b> assessment {{is imperative to}} determine the status {{and needs of the}} <b>patient</b> and the delivery of appropriate <b>patient</b> care. Nurses must be highly skilled in conducting timely and accurate <b>patient</b> assessments to overcome environmental obstacles and deliver quality and safe <b>patient</b> care. A structured approach to <b>patient</b> assessment is widely accepted in everyday clinical practice, yet {{little is known about the}} impact structured <b>patient</b> assessment frameworks have on <b>patient</b> care. Design: Integrative review. Methods: An electronic database search was conducted using Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System, PubMed and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. The reference sections of textbooks and journal articles on <b>patient</b> assessment were manually searched for further studies. A comprehensive peer review screening process was undertaken. Research studies were selected that evaluated the impact structured <b>patient</b> assessment frameworks have on <b>patient</b> care. Studies were included if frameworks were designed for use by paramedics, nurses or medical practitioners working in prehospital or acute in-hospital settings. Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. There were no studies that evaluate the impact of a generic nursing assessment framework on <b>patient</b> care. The use of a structured <b>patient</b> assessment framework improved clinician performance of <b>patient</b> assessment. Limited evidence was found to support other aspects of <b>patient</b> care including documentation, communication, care implementation, <b>patient</b> and clinician satisfaction, and <b>patient</b> outcomes. Conclusion: Structured <b>patient</b> assessment frameworks enhance clinician performance of <b>patient</b> assessment and hold the potential to improve <b>patient</b> care and outcomes; however, further research is required to address these evidence gaps, particularly in nursing. Relevance to clinical practice: Acute care clinicians should consider using structured <b>patient</b> assessment frameworks in clinical practice to enhance their performance of <b>patient</b> assessment. </span...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{research}} {{describes the}} organization of <b>patient</b> education in hospitals and the conditions that influence this in the Netherlands, Flanders and England.

RESULTS: On the organizational level, {{there can be a}} <b>patient</b> information desk (England and the Netherlands) and/or a specialized officer on <b>patient</b> education (the Netherlands and England). In the three countries/regions, {{the organization of}} <b>patient</b> education on the program level, for <b>patient</b> groups, is characterized by consultations of specialized nurses, <b>patient</b> information materials and <b>patient</b> education policy. Expert centers stimulate <b>patient</b> education through training and quality projects. Lobbying by <b>patient</b> organizations is important for the setting up of <b>patient</b> education. Both expert centers and <b>patient</b> organizations are financially dependent on and respond to policy of the government.
