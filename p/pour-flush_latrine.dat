40|$|A {{nutritional}} {{study was}} carried out on six (five rural and one urban) low income groups in Peninsular Malaysia from 1992 - 1995. In this paper, the socio-economic data for the five rural groups- padi farmers, rubber smallholders, coconut smallholders, estate workers, and fishermen- are presented. With {{the exception of the}} estate workers, the sample was predominantly Malay, with an overall mean household size of 5. 30. Household incomes were generally low, and 47 % of all households had incomes that were below the poverty line income (PLI) of RM 405. Based on this PLI, the prevalence of poverty was above 50 % among the padi, rubber, coconut, and fishing households. Nevertheless, the study population appeared to be better off in terms of the other indicators examined. Poultry rearing, for example, was widespread in the padi, rubber, and coconut villages; 65 % of all households owned at least one motorised vehicle, 53 % owned a refrigerator, and 83 % owned a television set. Furthermore, over 80 % of all households had access to piped water, 96 % had electricity supply, and over 90 % had a flush or <b>pour-flush</b> <b>latrine.</b> In comparison to the 1979 - 1983 poverty villages study (Chong et al., 1984), the households in the current study enjoyed better living conditions. Strict comparisons between the two studies, however, is difficult owing to the different criteria adopted in the selection of the study villages...|$|E
40|$|There are {{at least}} 2. 6 billion {{people in the world}} without {{improved}} sanitation. Improved sanitation is defined by WHO as connection to a Public sewer, connection to a septic system, a <b>pour-flush</b> <b>latrine,</b> a simple or ventilated pit latrine. Most of this 2. 6 billion reside in rural Asia and Africa. But technically even access to improved sanitation does not solve the problem, a spit latrines which serve about 2. 8 billion people usually fail to sanitize and contribute to ground water pollution. Also, septic systems and sewerage treatment plant often discharge in to the overloading and eutrophication. The need to close the loop on nutrients indicates that a paradigm shift towards sustainable sanitation is necessary environment with little or no sanitization or nutrient removal, polluting the ground water table streams, lake sand coastal zones, helping to perpetuate the cycle of human disease and upsetting fragile aquatic ecosystems by nutrient. The health risks associated with the current state of sanitation in the world require immediate action. Thus in present scenario huge amount of water and piping coverage is required and inspite of all these things the operational and maintenance cost are also high. This traditional British flush sanitation system has created havoc. Ample amount of NPK which is readily available in absorbable form by plants is wasted down the drain. Due to ever expansion of urban areas are getting far away which is increasing the cost of conveyance of sewage...|$|E
5000|$|Some pit latrines use {{water for}} {{flushing}} - these are called <b>pour-flush</b> pit <b>latrines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other {{types of}} pit latrines may include the Reed Odourless Earth Closet, the arborloo or treebog (very simple types of {{composting}} toilet), or the twin pit <b>pour-flush</b> pit <b>latrine,</b> popularized by Sulabh International.|$|R
2500|$|In a pourflush pit latrine, a {{squatting}} toilet with a {{water seal}} (U-trap or siphon) is used over {{one or two}} offset pits instead of a plain hole or seat. Therefore, these types of toilets do require water for flushing but otherwise have {{many of the same}} characteristics as simple pit latrines and are for this reason subsumed under the term [...] "pit latrine". The fecal sludge that is removed from the full pits of twin-pit pour-pour flush pit latrines is somewhat safer to handle and reuse than the fecal sludge from single pit <b>pour-flush</b> <b>latrines,</b> although significant health risks remain in either case and are a cause for concern.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In rural Bangladesh, India and elsewhere, pour-flush pit latrines are {{the most}} common {{sanitation}} system. When a single pit latrine becomes full, users must empty it themselves and risk exposure to fresh feces, pay an emptying service to remove pit contents or build a new latrine. Double pit pour-flush latrines may serve as a long-term sanitation option including high water table areas because the pits {{do not need to be}} emptied immediately and the excreta decomposes into reusable soil. Methods Double pit pour-flush latrines were implemented in rural Bangladesh for ‘hardcore poor’ households by a national NGO, BRAC. We conducted interviews, focus groups, and spot checks in two low-income, rural areas of Bangladesh to explore the advantages and limitations of using double pit latrines compared to single pit latrines. Results The rural households accepted the double pit <b>pour-flush</b> <b>latrine</b> model and considered it feasible to use and maintain. This latrine design increased accessibility of a sanitation facility for these low-income residents and provided privacy, convenience and comfort, compared to open defecation. Although a double pit latrine is more costly and requires more space than a single pit latrine the households perceived this sanitation system to save resources, because households did not need to hire service workers to empty pits or remove decomposed contents themselves. In addition, the excreta decomposition process produced a reusable soil product that some households used in homestead gardening. The durability of the latrine superstructures was a problem, as most of the bamboo-pole superstructure broke after 6 – 18  months of use. Conclusions Double pit pour-flush latrines are a long-term improved sanitation option that offers users several important advantages over single pit pour-flush latrines like in rural Bangladesh which can also be used in areas with high water table. Further research can provide an understanding of the comparative health impacts and effectiveness of the model in preventing human excreta from entering the environment...|$|E
40|$|Over {{seventy percent}} of the 2. 5 billion people who still lack access to basic {{sanitation}} worldwide live in rural areas (WHO/UNICEF, 2012). Despite concerns of water scarcity, resource depletion, and climate change little research has been conducted on the environmental sustainability of household sanitation technologies common in rural areas of developing countries or the potential of resource recovery to mitigate the environmental impacts of these systems. The environmental sustainability, in terms of embodied energy and carbon footprint, was analyzed for four household sanitation systems: (1) Ventilated Improved Pit (VIP) latrine, (2) <b>pour-flush</b> <b>latrine,</b> (3) composting latrine, and (4) biodigester latrine. Variations in design and construction materials used change the embodied energy of the systems. It was found that systems that used clay brick {{in the construction of the}} superstructure had an average cumulative energy demand 4, 307 MJ and a global warming potential 362 kilograms of greenhouse gas equivalent (kgCO 2 eq) higher than systems that used adobe brick in the construction of the superstructure. It was also found that systems that incorporate resource recovery, such as a composting or biodigester latrine, can become net energy producers over their service life, recovering between 29, 333 and 253, 190 MJ over a 20 -year period, compared to the 11, 275 to 19, 990 MJ required for their construction and maintenance. Recovering the resources from the waste also significantly lowered the global warming potential of these systems from 2, 079 - 49, 655 kgCO 2 eq to 616 - 1, 882 kgCO 2 eq; significantly less than the global warming potential of VIP latrine or pour-flush latrines (8, 642 - 15, 789 kgCO 2 eq). In addition, two community wastewater treatment systems that serve 420 - 1, 039 individuals considered in a similar study had a higher cumulative energy demand per household (44, 869 MJ and 38, 403 MJ) than the household sanitation systems (11, 275 - 19, 990 MJ). The community wastewater treatment systems had a lower global warming potential (2019 - 2, 092 kgCO 2 eq) than household systems that did not recover resources (8, 642 - 15, 789 kg CO 2 eq), but higher than household systems that incorporate resource recovery (616 - 1, 882 kgCO 2 eq). The goal of this study is to provide insight to policy makers in the development field to promote decision making based on environmental sustainability in the implementation of improved sanitation coverage in rural areas of developing countries...|$|E
40|$|During the {{resettlement}} of 6500 persons living {{around the}} Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric project in Laos, more than 1200 <b>pour-flush</b> <b>latrines</b> were constructed. To assess {{the role of}} these latrines as productive larval habitats for mosquitoes, entomological investigations using Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps, visual inspection and emergence trapping were carried out in over 300 latrines during the rainy seasons of 2008 - 2010. Armigeres subalbatus (Diptera: Culicidae) were nine {{times more likely to}} be found in latrines (mean catch: 3. 09) than in adjacent bedrooms (mean catch: 0. 37) [odds ratio (OR) 9. 08, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 6. 74 - 15. 11] and mosquitoes were active in and around 59 % of latrines at dusk. Armigeres subalbatus was strongly associated with latrines with damaged or improperly sealed septic tank covers (OR 5. 44, 95 % CI 2. 02 - 14. 67; P < 0. 001). Armigeres subalbatus is a nuisance biter and a putative vector of Japanese encephalitis and dengue viruses. Dengue virus serotype 3 was identified from a single pool of non-blood-fed female A. subalbatus using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Maintaining a good seal around septic tanks by covering them with a layer of soil is a simple intervention to block mosquito exit/entry and contribute to vector control in resettlement villages. The scale-up of this simple, cheap intervention would have global impact in preventing the colonization of septic tanks by nuisance biting and disease-transmitting mosquitoes. </p...|$|R
25|$|A {{pit latrine}} or pit toilet {{is a type}} of toilet that {{collects}} human feces in a hole in the ground. They use either no water or one to three liters per flush with <b>pour-flush</b> pit <b>latrines.</b> When properly built and maintained they can decrease the spread of disease by reducing the amount of human feces in the environment from open defecation. This decreases the transfer of pathogens between feces and food by flies. These pathogens are major causes of infectious diarrhea and intestinal worm infections. Infectious diarrhea resulted in about 700,000 deaths in children under five years old in 2011 and 250 million lost school days. Pit latrines are the lowest cost method of separating feces from people.|$|R
2500|$|Pit latrines are {{sometimes}} {{also referred to}} as [...] "dry toilets" [...] but this is not recommended because a [...] "dry toilet" [...] is an overarching term used for several types of toilets and strictly speaking only refers to the user interface. Depending on the region, the term [...] "pit latrine" [...] may be used to denote a toilet that has a squatting pan with a water seal or siphon (more accurately termed a <b>pour-flush</b> pit <b>latrine</b> – very common in South East Asia for example) or simply {{a hole in the ground}} without a water seal (also called a simple pit latrine) – the common type in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Whilst a dry toilet can be with or without urine diversion, a pit latrine is almost always without urine diversion. The key characteristic of a pit latrine is the use of a pit, which infiltrates liquids into the ground and acts as a device for storage and very limited treatment.|$|R
40|$|Gunung Kidul {{district}} in Yogyakarta Special Province, Indonesia undergoes an acute water shortage despite receiving high amounts of precipitation {{during the rainy}} season. Since this area is a karst region, water normally infiltrates into the ground, flows through the underground caves and finally {{ends up in the}} Indian Ocean. In general, sanitation systems in Gunung Kidul consist of either pit <b>latrines</b> or <b>pour-flush</b> toilets (<b>latrines).</b> Pit latrines are commonly found in rural areas while in urban areas, pour flush latrines take the lead. As a case for this study is Wonosari hospital (RSUD Wonosari. This hospital is largest public hospital found in Wonosari, Gunung Kudul region. With a capacity of about 115 beds, the hospital has about 351 staff, of which 160 are non-medic and 191 are medic staff. In regard to sanitation, the hospital currently has a kind of central wastewater disposal system with a subsequent biological treatment plant. This wastewater treatment plant is however not in the good condition and operation. Most of the wastewater resulted from hospital’s activities which is treated in this plant is not treated in the wastewater plant and even the treated wastewater is not really sufficiently purified. This lack of treatment can be indicated by the high BOD and COD value of the treated wastewater which does not meet the criteria that has been issued by the government of Indonesia. As an effort to promote sustainable sanitation and to have better results of wastewater treatment plants, a two-step anaerobic technology will be tested at the hospital area. The most suitable mode of operation is currently being tested in Germany after which the facility will be re-located to Indonesia. The first operation step of this digester is to treat sludge sediment from the hospital’s septic tanks which is not further treated and disposed properly in solid waste disposal (sanitary landfill). The main goal of this research is to optimize the operation performance of two-step anaerobic reactor treating septic tanks‘ sludge, either by investigating the maximum organic loading rate or by co-digestion with other types of wastes for more resources recovery. This goal leads to a promotion of affordable sanitation technologies, which have the ability to recover valuable material from wastewater, especially for the less developed countries...|$|R
