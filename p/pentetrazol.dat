50|$|Flurothyl was at {{one time}} studied in {{psychiatric}} medicine for shock therapy, {{in a similar manner}} to other convulsant drugs such as <b>pentetrazol,</b> as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This use has now been discontinued.|$|E
50|$|Some convulsants such as <b>pentetrazol</b> and flurothyl were {{previously}} used in shock therapy in psychiatric medicine, {{as an alternative}} to electroconvulsive therapy. Others such as strychnine and tetramethylenedisulfotetramine are used as poisons for exterminating pests. Bemegride and flumazenil are used to treat drug overdoses (of barbiturates and benzodiazepines respectively), but may cause convulsions if the dose is too high. Convulsants are also widely used in scientific research, for instance in the testing of new anticonvulsant drugs. Convulsions are induced in captive animals, then high doses of anticonvulsant drugs are administered.|$|E
50|$|Pentylenetetrazol, {{also known}} as pentylenetetrazole, metrazol, <b>pentetrazol</b> (INN), pentamethylenetetrazol, Corazol, Cardiazol or PTZ, is a drug {{formerly}} used as a circulatory and respiratory stimulant. High doses cause convulsions, as discovered by the Hungarian-American neurologist and psychiatrist Ladislas J. Meduna in 1934. It {{has been used in}} convulsive therapy, and was found to be effective—primarily for depression—but side-effects such as uncontrolled seizures were difficult to avoid. In 1939 pentylenetetrazol was replaced by electroconvulsive therapy, easier to administer, as the preferred method for inducing seizures in England's mental hospitals. In the US its approval by the FDA was revoked in 1982. It was used until recently in Italy as a cough suppressant.|$|E
40|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{activity of}} phenytoin-lipid conjugates obtained by covalent binding of 3 -hydroxymethylphenytoin to dimyristoylglycerides via a succinidyl linkage, to 2 -(1, 3 -dimyristoylglyceryl) butyric acid and to 3 -myristoyl- 2 -myristoylmethylpropionic acid was evaluated in the maximal electroshock (MES) {{test and the}} seizure threshold test with subcutaneous <b>pentetrazol.</b> The phenytoin-lipid conjugates were less active than the parent drug in the MES test after intraperitoneal administration as suspensions, but exhibited comparable activity when injected as a solution in dimethylsulphoxide. They also protected mice from MES-induced seizures following oral administration of aqueous suspensions of the compounds or when incorporated into emulsions. The anticonvulsant activity could be correlated to in-vitro pancreatic lipase-mediated hydrolysis. The bis-deacyl derivatives were at least as active {{but in some cases}} also more toxic than phenytoin. Oral administration of two of the lipid conjugates resulted in a faster onset of the anticonvulsant activity compared with the administration of an equimolar dose of phenytoin itself. All compounds were inactive in the subcutaneous <b>pentetrazol</b> test. It is concluded that the lipids act as prodrugs of phenytoin, which is generated by lipolysis upon oral administration...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneously {{acquired}} EEG and BOLD (Blood Oxygenation level dependent contrast) MRI {{allowed to}} study on line the neurophysiological changes in rat brain during epileptic seizures. MRI and EEG data were acquired with {{a specially designed}} high quality MR RF-antenna with incorporated non-invasive carbon EEG electrodes. The problem of severe pollution of the EEG data due to MR gradient switching during simultaneous EEG/MRI acquisitions was solved by a specially designed automated effective filtering algorithm. We measured continuously EEG data, and T 2 * -weighted coronal MRI sections of rat brain {{before and after the}} injection of <b>pentetrazol</b> (43 mg/(kg body weight) PTZ; convulsive dose 97 %), an epilepsy inductor. In this way, we could correlate the abnormalities in the EEG traces, with changes in the MRI BOLD signal intensities. Immediately after PTZ induction and before epileptic discharges were observed on the EEG traces, the cortex displayed an increase in BOLD signal intensity (inc [...] . status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Stimulants {{are banned}} by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) if used “in competition”. Being the {{analysis}} of stimulants presently carried out on urine samples only, it might be useful, for a better interpretation of analytical data, to discriminate between an early intake of the substance and an administration specifically aimed to improve the sport performance. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate the differences, in terms of excretion/disappearance of drugs, between urine and oral fluid, a sample that can reflect plasmatic concentrations. Oral fluid and urine samples were collected following oral administration of the following stimulants: modafinil (100 mg), selegiline (10 mg), crotetamide/cropropamide (50 mg each), <b>pentetrazol</b> (100 mg), ephedrine (12 mg), sibutramine (10 mg), mate de coca (a dose containing about 3 mg of cocaine); analysis of drugs/metabolites was carried out by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in both body fluids. Our results showthat both the absolute concentrations and their variation as a function of time, in urine and in oral fluid, are generally markedly different, being the drugs eliminated from urinemuch more slowly than from oral fluid. Our results also suggest that the analysis of oral fluid could be used to successfully complement the data obtained from urine for “in competition” anti-doping tests; in all those cases in which the metabolite(s) concentration of a substance in urine is very low and the parent compound is not detected, it is indeed impossible, relying on urinary data only, to discriminate between recent administrations of small doses and remote administrations of higher doses...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{prolonged}} clonic seizures diminish antiepileptic {{activity of}} valproate against pentetrazol-evoked convulsions. G. HABEREK, T. TOM-CZYK, E. M. URBAÑSKA. Pol. J. Pharmacol., 2001, 53, 81 – 82. Prolonged seizures may alter the brain function in numerous ways. It {{is conceivable that}} they might lead to modifications of seizure susceptibility or anticonvulsive drug efficacy, however, only limited data address this issue. Therefore, we have decided to estimate the antiepileptic activity of drugs interfering with GABA-ergic neurotransmission in mice subjected to prolonged clonic seizures 2 weeks before, using <b>pentetrazol</b> test. The activity of valproate, but not diazepam or phenobarbital, was diminished in animals following repetitive clonic seizures. It might be hypothesized that in humans suffering from epilepsy, prolonged seizures in the past might contribute to the lowered efficacy of valproic acid later on. Key words: prolonged seizures, antiepileptic drugs, valproate, phenobarbital, diazepam correspondence G. Haberek, T. Tomczyk, E. M. Urbañska Convulsive diseases, including epilepsy, occur in 1 to 5 % of human population. Unfortunately, approximately 20 % of patients are resistant to the currently used pharmacotherapy, but the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is still not well understood. Experimentally evoked status epilepticus (SE), often accompanied by severe neurodegeneration within limbic structures, may cause subsequent behavioral changes [4, 6]. It is conceivable that prolonged seizures might alter the brain function {{in a way which}} will lead to modifications of seizure susceptibility or anticonvulsive drug efficacy later on [5]. Suprisingly, only limited data address this issue. Experimental limbic seizures were shown to cause �-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -ergic system dysfunction followed by the lowered efficacy of antiepileptics upon next convulsive episod...|$|E
