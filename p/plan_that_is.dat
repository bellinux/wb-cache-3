5|$|To {{identify}} the optimal {{spatial and temporal}} distribution of radiation sources within the applicators of the implanted tissue or cavity, the treatment planning software allows virtual radiation sources to be placed within the virtual patient. The software shows a graphical representation {{of the distribution of}} the irradiation. This serves as a guide for the brachytherapy team to refine the distribution of the sources and provide a treatment <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> optimally tailored to the anatomy of each patient before actual delivery of the irradiation begins. This approach is sometimes called ‘dose-painting’.|$|E
5|$|In around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the River Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Adam also submitted {{plans for the}} new Assembly Rooms but these were rejected as too costly. John Wood, the Younger raised funding {{for the construction of}} the Assembly Rooms by the use of a Tontine, an investment <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combines features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter receives an annuity. As members die, their shares devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increases. On the death of the last member, the scheme is wound up. Construction started in 1769 and was completed in 1771, when a grand opening was held.|$|E

25|$|Washington, D.C., {{the capital}} of the United States, was planned under French-American {{architect}} Pierre Charles L'Enfant. Under the L'Enfant plan, the original District of Columbia was developed using a grid <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> interrupted by diagonal avenues, most famously Pennsylvania Avenue. These diagonals are often connected by traffic circles, such as Dupont Circle and Washington Circle. As the city grew, the plan was duplicated to cover most of the remainder of the capital. Meanwhile, the core of the city faced disarray and the McMillan Plan, led by Senator James McMillan, was adopted to build a National Mall and a parks system that is still today a jewel of the city.|$|E
25|$|How cities {{implement}} {{human rights}} ideals varies {{from city to}} city. This allows for each city to develop a <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> specific to its capacities, needs, problems, and concerns. Formally designated “Human Rights Cities” typically create a leadership body made up of community activists, residents, and public officials (or their appointees) working in partnership. Other cities may adopt human rights language and standards without officially adopting the name of Human Rights City. For instance, Barcelona is a leading human right city in Europe, and it created an Office of Non-Discrimination to implement the EU anti-racial discrimination policy within its borders as part of becoming a Human Rights City.|$|E
25|$|The main mode of {{retrieving}} {{data from}} a SQL Server database is querying for it. The query is expressed using a variant of SQL called T-SQL, a dialect Microsoft SQL Server shares with Sybase SQL Server due to its legacy. The query declaratively specifies {{what is to be}} retrieved. It is processed by the query processor, which figures out the sequence of steps that will be necessary to retrieve the requested data. The sequence of actions necessary to execute a query is called a query plan. There might be multiple ways to process the same query. For example, for a query that contains a join statement and a select statement, executing join on both the tables and then executing select on the results would give the same result as selecting from each table and then executing the join, but result in different execution plans. In such case, SQL Server chooses the <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> expected to yield the results in the shortest possible time. This is called query optimization and is performed by the query processor itself.|$|E

Kepler described his new astronomy as [...] "celestial physics", as [...] "an excursion into Aristotle's Metaphysics", and as [...] "a supplement to Aristotle's On the Heavens", transforming the ancient tradition of physical cosmology by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics.|$|E

2500|$|Stokowski rapidly {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a musical showman. His flair for the theatrical included grand gestures such as throwing the sheet music on the floor to show he did not need to conduct from a score. He also experimented with new lighting arrangements in the concert hall, at one point conducting in a dark hall with only his head and hands lighted, at other times arranging the lights so they would cast theatrical shadows of his head and hands. Late in the 1929-30 symphony season, Stokowski started conducting without a baton. His free-hand manner of conducting soon became one of his trademarks. On the musical side, Stokowski nurtured the orchestra and shaped the [...] "Stokowski" [...] sound, or {{what became known as the}} [...] "Philadelphia Sound". He encouraged [...] "free bowing" [...] from the string section, [...] "free breathing" [...] from the brass section, and continually altered the seating arrangements of the orchestra's sections, as well as the acoustics of the hall, in response to his urge to [...] create a better sound. Stokowski is credited as the first conductor to adopt the seating <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> used by most orchestras today, with first and second violins together on the conductor's left, and the violas and cellos to the right.|$|E
2500|$|Furstenfeld [...] {{is close}} to the {{historic}} boundary between the Duchy of Styria and Hungary. Its strategic position is emphasised by its re-fortification in the mid 16th century against the Turks. While the town is a long rectangular shape, property boundaries and vertical air photography shows that it consists of two distinct parts or towns. [...] The SE part has a curved street plan, a Y shaped market place, into which a Church, founded around 1200 by the Knights of St John was fitted, and the Pheilburg castle. The town was established about 1170 by Ottokar IV, Duke of Styria. Between 1215 and 1220 the Babenberg Leopold VI probably laid out an almost square town with a grid street <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> attached to the other town. The second town is very similar to the square frontier towns of Lower Austria, but is different inasmuch as it has an H street plan of the type seen in other Styrian towns. This plan consists of two main parallel streets that are joined across by wide market place, forming the bar to the H. In 1232 Furstenfeld received both Market rights and a charter. [...] The widespread reconstruction of the defences in the mid 16th century by the Italian military architect Domenico dell’Allio (1505–1563) has meant that much of the evidence for the Medieval walls has disappeared. There are remains of four large angular bastions at the corners of the town. [...] The re-construction of the fortress was finished in 1581.|$|E
