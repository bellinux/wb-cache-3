5|$|Enterprise is then {{ordered to}} Mars {{to destroy the}} array, but is turned away when a warning shot from the weapon damages the ship. Gannet Brooks, now in the brig, reveals to Ensign Mayweather she is a Starfleet Intelligence {{operative}}, and that Terra Prime <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> an operative aboard. Under the urging of Minister Samuels, the crew of Enterprise conceive a way to approach the deadly station undetected, using a shuttlepod hidden inside {{the tail of a}} comet. Captain Archer elects to lead the away mission, along with Lieutenant Reed, Doctor Phlox, and Mayweather.|$|E
5|$|Patchy {{records from}} around the world {{indicate}} the bignose shark <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> a circumglobal distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. In the Atlantic Ocean, it occurs from Delaware Bay to Brazil, in the Mediterranean Sea, and off West Africa. In the Indian Ocean, it is known in South Africa and Madagascar, the Red Sea, India, and the Maldives. In the Pacific Ocean, it has been recorded from China to Australia, around Hawaii, and from the Gulf of California to Ecuador. It is reportedly common off Florida, the Bahamas, and the West Indies, and rare off Brazil and in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Since the Norse sources (including the skaldic verses {{which were}} the sagas' main sources) chiefly {{describe}} war-related matters, less is known about other events during the reigns of the early Norwegian kings. Snorri, for instance, wrote fifteen pages about Magnus and only two pages about Magnus' peaceful father Olaf Kyrre (despite Olaf's reign lasting almost three times longer than Magnus'). Modern historians have noted that this <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> made the image of kings like Magnus Barefoot one-sided (in Magnus' case, skewed towards his deeds as a warrior).|$|E

5|$|Sélestat {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 727 AD but the town <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> an earlier Celtic or Roman origin. Archaeological findings {{provide evidence of}} human settlement during the Mesolithic, the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. A large number of wood piles dating from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD were discovered around St. Quirin chapel, suggesting a Roman settlement. At that time Sélestat might have already been a port on the river Ill.|$|E
5|$|Sol quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said that there is {{something}} about Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have to}} act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E
5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Many {{of them have been}} estimated based on the element's position on the periodic table as a heavier analog of iodine, {{and a member of the}} halogens (the group of elements including fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). Astatine is likely to have a dark or lustrous appearance and may be a semiconductor or possibly a metal; it <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> a higher melting point than that of iodine. Chemically, several anionic species of astatine are known and most of its compounds resemble those of iodine. It also shows some metallic behavior, including being able to form a stable monatomic cation in aqueous solution (unlike the lighter halogens).|$|E

5|$|Whereas the {{dynamics}} of Jovian magnetosphere mainly depend on internal sources of energy, the solar wind <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> a role as well, particularly {{as a source of}} high-energy protons. The structure of the outer magnetosphere shows some features of a solar wind-driven magnetosphere, including a significant dawn–dusk asymmetry. In particular, magnetic field lines in the dusk sector are bent in the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector. In addition, the dawn magnetosphere contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail, whereas in the dusk magnetosphere, the field lines are closed. All these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process, known on Earth as the Dungey cycle, may also be taking place in the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} {{millennium}} BC, Ugarit's population was Amorite, and the Ugaritic language <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> a direct Amoritic origin. The kingdom of Ugarit may have controlled about 2,000km2 on average.|$|E
25|$|GLUD1 {{can form}} long fibers by {{end to end}} {{association}} of the hexamers. The polimerization is unrelated to the catalytic activity, but <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> an important role such as formation of multienzyme comolexes.|$|E

25|$|Other churches with gothic {{parts from}} 14.-16. century are St.Johannis in Burgfarrnbach, St.Peter and Paul in Poppenreuth and St.Matthäus in Vach. St. Peter and Paul <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> some older parts, the {{previous}} building was probably founded around 900 - 1000 and was mother Church {{of many other}} churches f.e. St.Sebald in Nuremberg.|$|E
25|$|The impact {{can also}} produce {{sonoluminescence}} from the collapsing bubble. This {{will produce a}} very small amount of light within the collapsing bubble, although the light is too weak and short-lived to be detected without advanced scientific equipment. The light emission <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> no biological significance but is rather a side-effect of the rapid snapping motion. Pistol shrimp produce this effect in a very similar manner.|$|E

25|$|Bracken (Pteridium) is a genus of large, coarse ferns in {{the family}} Dennstaedtiaceae. Ferns (Pteridophyta) are {{vascular}} plants that have alternating generations, large plants that produce spores and small plants that produce sex cells (eggs and sperm). Brackens are noted for their large, highly divided leaves. They are found on all continents except Antarctica and in all environments except deserts, though their typical habitat is moorland. The genus <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> the widest distribution of any fern in the world.|$|E
25|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads have a wide visual field, useful for detecting predators, while those with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate distances when hunting. The American woodcock <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> the largest visual field of any bird, 360° in the horizontal plane, and 180° in the vertical plane.|$|E
25|$|Copulation is {{frequent}} {{in winter}} colonies, {{with as many}} as 27 instances observed per day in colonies with large proportions of female bats. During mating, the bats screech loudly, and males will lick the female's vulva. This species <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> the ability to breed year-round. Gestation is estimated at 5–7 months, after which the female gives birth to one pup. Pups are most frequently seen in August, though they have been observed in February, March, April, and December as well.|$|E
