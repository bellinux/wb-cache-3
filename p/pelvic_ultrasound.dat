30|$|Material and Methods: A {{woman with}} thirty-six years old, {{with a history}} of pavimentocelular {{invasive}} carcinoma underwent a total hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy and preservation attachments one year ago, was admitted in our hospital with lower abdominal pain and fever. The abdominal examination reveals diffuse tenderness greatest in the lower quadrants and the presence of a palpable adnexal mass and the <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> demonstrate a tubo-ovarian abcess in the left and the presence of fluid in the cul-de-sac. We decided to carry out laparoscopy because the patient wasn’t clearly improving after approximately 48 hours of treatment for PID.|$|R
25|$|A {{physical}} examination, {{including a}} pelvic examination, and a <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> (transvaginal or otherwise) are both essential for diagnosis: physical examination may reveal increased abdominal girth and/or ascites (fluid within the abdominal cavity), while pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass. An adnexal mass {{is a significant}} finding that often indicates ovarian cancer, especially if it is fixed, nodular, irregular, solid, and/or bilateral. 13–21% of adnexal masses are caused by malignancy; however, there are other benign causes of adnexal masses, including ovarian follicular cyst, leiomyoma, endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy, hydrosalpinx, tuboovarian abscess, ovarian torsion, dermoid cyst, cystadenoma (serous or mucinous), diverticular or appendiceal abscess, nerve sheath tumor, pelvic kidney, ureteral or bladder diverticulum, benign cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum, peritoneal tuberculosis, or paraovarian cyst. Ovaries that can be felt are also a sign of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women. Other parts of a physical examination for suspected ovarian cancer can include a breast examination and a digital rectal exam. Palpation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes may reveal lymphadenopathy, which can be indicative of metastasis. Another indicator may be {{the presence of a}} pleural effusion, which can be noted on auscultation.|$|E

40|$|A 16 -year-old {{adolescent}} {{presented to}} the Emergency Department with abdominal pain in the left lower quadrant with two weeks of duration and history of constipation. She denied onset of sexual activity and her last menses occurred three weeks before. On physical examination, she had a mild abdominal tenderness on the left lower quadrant. The initial blood workup and urine were normal. Abdominal and <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> revealed a complex cyst on the left adnexal region and ascites. The serum hormone human chorionic gonadotropin was positive (2608 mUI/mL). Transvaginal ultrasound showed a simple adnexal cyst with a cobweb-like area contiguous to it. An intrauterine gestational sac was not seen. Exploratory laparotomy was performed showing an hemoperitoneum and a left ectopic tubal pregnancy. Salpingectomy was performed. The authors intend {{to draw attention to}} a rare cause of abdominal pain in adolescence that should be considered in order to avoid a potentially fatal outcome...|$|R
50|$|The term previvor {{has been}} used to {{describe}} unaffected carriers. Unaffected carriers, or previvors, are those who have not diagnosed with cancer, but who know that they are likely to develop cancer due to certain genetic mutations that form a known cancer syndrome. They have a survived the predisposition, or higher risk, of cancer. As such, this is the first generation in human history who, armed with information about a predisposition to a cancer after opting into DNA testing, can make informed choices prior to cancer diagnosis. The typical previvor has tested positive for a BRCA mutation and learned that she is at high risk for developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and is attempting to manage that risk through a combination of increased surveillance through mammograms, breast MRIs, <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasounds,</b> oophorectomy, bilateral mastectomy, and other medical procedures. There has been much controversy over the term previvor, {{due to the fact that}} the name compares these healthy women to people have actually been diagnosed with invasive cancer.|$|R
50|$|A {{health history}} and a {{physical}} examination can lead the health care practitioner to suspect endometriosis. Although doctors can often feel the endometrial growths during a pelvic exam, and these symptoms may be signs of endometriosis, diagnosis cannot be confirmed by exam only. Use of <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> may identify large endometriotic cysts (called endometriomas). However, smaller endometriosis implants cannot be visualized with ultrasound technique.|$|E

50|$|In {{approximately}} 1 in 2,000 infants, {{there is}} enough variation in {{the appearance of the}} external genitalia to merit hesitation about appropriate assignment by the physician involved. Typical examples would be an unusually prominent clitoris in an otherwise apparently typical girl, or complete cryptorchidism in an otherwise apparently typical boy. In most of these cases, a sex is tentatively assigned and the parents told that tests will be performed to confirm the apparent sex. Typical tests in this situation might include a <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> to determine the presence of a uterus, a testosterone or 17α-hydroxyprogesterone level, and/or a karyotype. In some of these cases a pediatric endocrinologist is consulted to confirm the tentative sex assignment. The expected assignment is usually confirmed within hours to a few days in these cases.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of bromocriptine on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in serum, kidney function and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women undergoing in vitro fertilization. Twenty-eight women were randomly divided into two groups and were administered daily oral capsules for 14 days, starting on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration. Group A received 2. 0 mg of folic acid, whereas Group B was given 2. 5 mg of bromocriptine. Physical exams, <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> and laboratory evaluations were performed on the day of hCG administration and again 7 days later. No differences in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, urine volume, creatinine clearance, urine sodium concentration or serum VEGF levels were found between the two groups. Thus, these results indicate that bromocriptine does not affect blood levels of VEGF, kidney function or the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in high-risk patients subjected to in vitro fertilization.

40|$|Twenty-five healthy women {{volunteers were}} {{selected}} to evaluate ovulation inhibition by a monophasic oral contraceptive preparation containing 75 micrograms gestodene and 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol. Each subject participated for eight consecutive cycles, consisting of a pretreatment cycle, six treatment cycles, and a posttreatment cycle. During five explored cycles, serum LH, FSH, estradiol, and progesterone levels were measured daily on cycle days 8 through 17; in addition, progesterone was measured once, around cycle day 21. <b>Pelvic</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> were performed on cycle days 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16. In the 18 volunteers completing the entire study, LH and FSH levels were strongly depressed, in equivalent degree, during the first, third, and sixth treated cycles. From treated cycle days 8 to 17, a significant decline of LH and FSH levels occurred, reaching values on the lower limit of detection. Luteal activity was not detected {{in any of the}} treated cycles. Follicular activity, as reflected by estradiol levels, was more strongly depressed during the first treated cycle (first contraceptive pill taken on day 1 of menstruation) than in the third and sixth treated cycles (the first pill taken after a seven-day pill-free interval). The excellent inhibition of follicular maturation was confirmed by ultrasonic assessment of the ovaries. Restoration of ovarian function during the first posttreatment cycle was excellent, showing a midcycle hormonal profile identical to that of the pretrial cycle...|$|R

30|$|This {{retrospective}} study included 336 {{women who were}} 18 – 45  years old.

In all these cases, gynaecological examination and transvaginal <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> were performed. There were no pathological <b>pelvic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> findings.
