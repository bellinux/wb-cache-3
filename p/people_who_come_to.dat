We {{need to be aware}} of them, because the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see Petra go to see those bands as well. We are being very naïve if we don't keep that in mind. We need to have a light system, sound system and presentation that will be competitive with those groups.|$|E
25|$|Mecca {{has been}} the site of several {{incidents}} and failures of crowd control {{because of the large}} numbers of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> make the Hajj. For example, on 2 July 1990, a pilgrimage to Mecca ended in tragedy when the ventilation system failed in a crowded pedestrian tunnel and 1,426 people were either suffocated or trampled to death in a stampede. On 24 September 2015, 700 pilgrims were killed in a stampede at Mina during the stoning-the-Devil ritual at Jamarat.|$|E
25|$|In Gaza, desalinated {{brackish}} groundwater {{has become}} {{an important source of}} drinking water. Over 20,000 consumers in over 50% of the Gaza households have installed domestic ‘reverse osmosis’ (RO) units to desalinate water for drinking purposes. The water quality is high, though the water lacks basic minerals. As of January 2014, there were 18 neighborhood desalination plants in the Gaza strip, providing safe drinking water for free to 95,000 <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> fill their canisters at the plants. 13 of these plants are operated by UNICEF.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{the rains}} comes, and the villagers {{celebrate}} with ancient rituals and dances. During this time, Karega starts a correspondence with the lawyer {{that he met}} in Nairobi, wishing to educate himself further. To celebrate the rain's coming, Nyakinyua brews a drink from the Thang'eta plant, which all of the villagers drink. Karega tells the story the love between him and Mukami, the older sister of Munira. Mukami's father looked down on Karega because of his brother's involvement with the Mau Mau. Forced to separate, Mariamu and Karega do not see each other again, and Mukami later commits suicide by jumping into a quarry. This {{is the first time}} Munira hears the story. Later, an unknown plane crashes in the village; the only victim is Abdulla's donkey. Wanja notices that there are several large groups of <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> survey the wreckage, and suggests to Abdulla that they begin to sell the Thang'eta drink in Abdulla's bar. The drink attracts notoriety, and many people come to the bar in order to sample it. Out of fury for Karega's connection to his family and jealousy of his relationship with Wanja, Munira schemes to have Karega fired from his teaching post with the school. Karega then leaves Ilmorog.|$|E
500|$|Although the Daddies were {{experiencing}} commercial success {{under the guise}} of swing revivalists, having been declared the [...] "leaders" [...] of the movement by Rolling Stone, the band openly contested being labeled a retro act at the exclusion of their dominant ska and punk influences and modernist lyricism. While still vocal supporters of both the swing revival and its bands, the Daddies adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the swing scene and in particular its nostalgia-based mentality. Perry explained to Spin in July 1998, [...] "it's not our mission to be a swing band. I'm not a guy from the '40s. That's why we play ska and use heavy guitars", noting elsewhere [...] "I can't fully take us out of the retro classification, but we harp on the fact that we're contemporary music". Thusly, the Daddies avoided touring with swing bands, selecting Latin rock group Ozomatli and ska/soul band The Pietasters as support on their first headlining U.S. tour, and opening for Argentine rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on their 1998 North American tour. At one point, the Daddies attempted to arrange a tour with Primus which never materialized; said Perry, [...] "I know there are <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> our shows who'd like nothing more than for us to play swing 24/7...there are plenty of bands who want to be swing bands and swing bands only. We're trying to find the audience who'll let us write songs and just be who we are".|$|E

The same thing happens with all these <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see me, and take so much trouble over their efforts to describe themselves to me with strict accuracy; inevitably I form an image of them which derives as much from myself as from them.

2500|$|Neverland is {{a fictional}} {{location}} {{featured in the}} works of J. M. Barrie and those based on them.

Although not all <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Neverland cease to age, its best known resident famously refused to grow up, and it is often used as a metaphor for eternal childhood (and childishness), immortality, and escapism.

2500|$|Keane caused {{controversy}} in November 2000, when he criticised sections of United supporters after the Champions League victory over Dynamo Kyiv at Old Trafford. He {{complained about the}} lack of vocal support given by some fans when Dynamo were dominating the game, stating, [...] "Away from home our fans are fantastic, I'd call them the hardcore fans. But at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch. I don't think some of the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Old Trafford can spell 'football', never mind understand it." [...] Keane's comments started a debate in England about the changing atmosphere in football grounds, and the term [...] "prawn sandwich brigade" [...] is now part of the English football vocabulary, referring to people who attend football games or claim to be fans of football because it is fashionable rather than due to any genuine interest in the game.|$|E
