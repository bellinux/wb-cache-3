500|$|A further {{avenue of}} {{defending}} the Codex's authenticity was based not upon {{understanding of the}} astrological and oracular content, but upon understanding of the language and hieroglyphics themselves. In 1973 Michael Coe would write that [...] "there was no forger {{in the world that}} could <b>possibly</b> <b>know</b> to combine glyphs in the manner presented in the Grolier Codex." [...] In a 1983 study John Carlson echoes Coe with a conclusion that the Grolier Codex reflects knowledge of the Mayan language that was not known to be deciphered by academics until 1982, long after the Codex's discovery in the 1960s. Carlson and Coe were not able to disprove the forgery hypothesis with this information, but the circumstances required for a potential forger to possess this information but never reveal it made its veracity far more likely according to them.|$|E
2500|$|Socrates repeats {{his claim}} that formal accusations of {{corruption}} and impiety shall not destroy him, but that he shall be harmed by the prejudiced gossip and slanders of his enemies. He tells the court of being unafraid of death, because his true concern is in acting ethically. That people who fear death are showing their ignorance, because death {{might be a good}} thing, but that most people fear death as an evil thing, when they cannot <b>possibly</b> <b>know</b> death to be either good or evil. Socrates says that his wisdom is in being aware that he is ignorant: “I am wiser than this man; it is likely that neither of us knows anything worthwhile, but he thinks he knows something, when he does not.” Apology, 21d.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ecommerce}} website ThinkGeek sells {{a t-shirt}} {{based on the}} Schrödinger's cat experiment. One side of the shirt reads, [...] "Schrödinger's cat is dead." [...] The other side reads, [...] "Schrödinger's cat is not dead." [...] This parodies {{the concept of the}} cat being both dead and alive. The site also sells a shirt for women which reads [...] "Hello Schroddy", and features a white box with a red bow, being a play on both Schrödinger's Cat and Hello Kitty. The description reads, [...] "This might not be Hello Kitty. It might be Goodbye Kitty. We cannot <b>possibly</b> <b>know</b> without observing, and then we change the outcome." [...] ThinkGeek also sells a box with a sliding door, which activates an internal electronic display to show an animation of either a living or deceased cat. The box has a sign reading [...] "WARNING: MAY OR MAY NOT CONTAIN LIVE ANIMAL". [...] A relatively new product is a pair of drinking mugs; when full of hot liquid one shows a live cat and the other a dead one.|$|E
