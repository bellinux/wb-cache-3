25|$|Windows Media DRM or WMDRM, is a Digital Rights Management {{service for}} the Windows Media platform.

25|$|For film {{projection}} systems, Digital Theater Systems, the company behind the DTS surround sound standard, {{has created a}} digital captioning device called the DTS-CSS (Cinema Subtitling System). It {{is a combination of}} a laser projector which places the captioning (words, sounds) anywhere on the screen and a thin <b>playback</b> <b>device</b> with a CD that holds many languages. If the Rear Window Captioning System is used, the DTS-CSS player is also required for sending caption text to the Rear Window sign located {{in the rear of the}} theater.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 1920s, {{engineers}} at Western Electric, as well as independent inventors such as Orlando Marsh, developed technology for capturing sound with a microphone, amplifying it with vacuum tubes, then using the amplified signal to drive an electromechanical recording head. Western Electric's innovations resulted in a greatly expanded and more even frequency response, creating a dramatically fuller, clearer and more natural-sounding recording. Distant or less strong sounds that were impossible to record by the old methods could now be captured. Volume was now limited only by the groove spacing on the record and the limitations of the intended <b>playback</b> <b>device.</b> Victor and Columbia licensed the new electrical system from Western Electric and began issuing electrically recorded discs during the Spring of 1925. The first classical recording was of Chopin impromptus and Schubert's Litanei by Alfred Cortot for Victor.|$|E
500|$|AACS {{can be used}} {{to revoke}} a key of a {{specific}} <b>playback</b> <b>device,</b> after it is known to have been compromised, as it has for WinDVD. The compromised players can still be used to view old discs, but not newer releases without encryption keys for the compromised players. If other players are then cracked, further revocation would lead to legitimate users of compromised players being forced to upgrade or replace their player software or firmware in order to view new discs. Each <b>playback</b> <b>device</b> comes with a binary tree of secret device and processing keys. The processing key in this tree, a requirement to play the AACS encrypted discs, is selected based on the device key and the information on the disc to be played. As such, a processing key such as the [...] "09 F9" [...] key is not revoked, but newly produced discs cause the playback devices to select a different valid processing key to decrypt the discs.|$|E

5000|$|Manufacturers {{of certain}} <b>playback</b> <b>devices</b> such as set-top boxes can be required, as a {{condition}} of private contracts, to allow publishers or broadcasters to disable analog outputs entirely, or to degrade the analog output quality, when particular programming is displayed. This capability is one example of selectable output control. A broadcaster could then prevent all recording of a broadcast program by indicating that compliant receiving devices should refuse to output it through analog outputs at all. On some of the latest <b>playback</b> <b>devices,</b> analog outputs have been eliminated completely.|$|R

50|$|Drum {{machines}} {{typically are}} sample <b>playback</b> <b>devices</b> {{that specialize in}} drum and percussion sounds. They commonly contain a sequencer that allows the creation of drum patterns, and allows them to be arranged into a song. There often are multiple audio outputs, so that each sound or group of sounds can be routed to a separate output. The individual drum voices may be playable from another MIDI instrument, or from a sequencer.|$|R
