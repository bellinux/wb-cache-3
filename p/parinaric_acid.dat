40|$|<b>Parinaric</b> <b>acid,</b> a {{naturally}} occurring 18 -carbon fatty acid containing 4 conjugated double bonds, is toxic to human monocytic leukemia cells at concentrations of 5 MMor less.

When U- 937 cells are differentiated to the monocytic form, they become resistant to as much as 30 MMparinaric acid.

40|$|AbstractBinding of the {{polyunsaturated}} cis-parinaric acid to bovine β-lactoglobulin (BLG) was {{studied by}} circular dichroism (CD), electronic absorption spectroscopy and mass spectrometry methods. Upon protein binding, the UV absorption band of <b>parinaric</b> <b>acid</b> is red shifted by ca. 5 nm, showing hypochromism and reduced vibrational fine structure, {{suggesting that the}} ligand binds as a monomer in non-planar geometry. In the CD spectra measured at pH 7. 36 and 8. 5 a strong, negative Cotton band appears centered at 310 nm (Δϵ=− 25 M− 1 cm− 1) corresponding to the long-wavelength absorption band of cis-parinaric acid. The source of this induced optical activity is the helical distortion of the polyene chromophore caused by the chiral protein environment. From CD spectral data {{the value of the}} association constant was calculated to be 4. 7 × 105 M− 1 at pH 7. 36. CD and mass spectrometry measurements showed that <b>parinaric</b> <b>acid</b> binds weakly to BLG in acidic solution, though small peaks at mass 18559 and 18645 can be obtained in the reconstructed electrospray mass spectrum; these correspond to the binding of <b>parinaric</b> <b>acid</b> in 1 : 1 stoichiometry to both monomer variants of BLG B and A.

40|$|The use of {{fluorescent}} conjugated polyenoic {{fatty acids}} as probes of membrane structure is introduced. alpha- and beta-parinaric acid (cis, trans, trans, cis-, and all trans- 9, 11, 13, 15 -octadecatetraenoic acid) and synthetic lecithins containing an alpha-parinaric acid chain in position 2 are prepared and their absorption and fluorescence properties are determined. Phase transitions are detected as fluorescence changes at characteristic temperatures when either the {{free fatty acid}} probes or the labeled phospholipid probe are included in sonicated aqueous dispersions of L-alpha-dimyristoyl lecithin, L-alpha dipalmitoyl lecithin, or L-alpha-distearoyl lecithin. The phase transitions are detected at about 23 degrees C (dimyristoyl), 44 degrees C (dipalmitoyl), and 53 degrees C (distearoyl lecithin). Binding of alpha-parinaric acid to bovine serum albumin is measured by shifts in the absorption spectrum and enhanced quantum yield of the fatty acid upon binding and by energy transfer between 2 tryptophyl residues in bovine serum albumin and alpha-parinaric acid. Approximately six binding sites are detected.

This method is par-ticularly appropriate for monitoring increased concen-trations of fatty acids that may be present during intrave-nous lipid infusion, especially in neonates. Binding cis-parinaric acid (9, 11, 13, 1 5 -c/s-trans-trans-c is-o ctadeca-tetraenoic acid) to albumin shifts the absorption spectrum of the acid. If fattyacids are present in serum, they will compete with <b>parinaric</b> <b>acid</b> for binding, changing the ex-tent of this absorption shift.

The progress of this reaction is easily monitored by measurement of the decrease in the fluorescence intensity from a uniformly illuminated sample. The reaction rate measured in this way is sensitive to the thermal phase transition of the bilayer and to the presence of cholesterol. The relationship of the second-order rate constant to the lipid diffusion coefficient is discussed.

Both ESR and fluorescence energy transfer experiments show that the protein preferentially interacts with the negatively charged phospholipid in the mixed model membranes. Semi-quantitative analysis of the fluorescence energy transfer from the single tryptophan in apocytochrome c to the <b>parinaric</b> <b>acid</b> in phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylcholine in mixed bovine brain phosphatidylserine/egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles reveals and average donor-acceptor distance of 22 - 26 A and 26 - 30 A for phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine, respectively.

Two methods were developed for the detection of MMP in cell extracts to aid in the screening for potential mutants, one a qualitative procedure based on iodine binding by the sample after paper chromatography and the other a quantitative procedure based on fluorimetric titration of the MMP with <b>parinaric</b> <b>acid.</b> An ethionine-resistant mutant was obtained that contained only about 25 % of the normal level of S-adenosylmethionine and 10 % of the normal level of methionine adenosyltransferase (adenosine 5 '-triphosphate:L-methionine S-adenosyltransferase, EC 2. 5. 1. 6) activity. When grown in the presence of 0. 1 % ethionine, the mutant cells contained about 50 % of the wild-type levels of methylglucose lipopolysaccharides but only about 7 % of the normal level of MMP (wild-type cells contain about 0. 14 mM MMP and the mutant contains about 0. 01 mM MMP). The amount of fatty acid synthesis in the ethionine-resistant mutant grown in the presence of ethionine was not dramatically altered although the mutant accumulated more short-chain and less long-chain unsaturated fatty acids than the wild-type cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{fluorescence}} lifetimes of <b>parinaric</b> <b>acid</b> (PnA) isomers {{have been}} measured in pure solvents and in synthetic phospholipid membranes {{over a wide}} temperature range. In pure solvents, dodecane, ethanol, and cyclohexanol, the emission is well described by three exponential components of approximately 40, 12, and 2 ns. The preexponential factor of the long-lifetime component is quite small, and this component is neglected in the present study. The preexponential factors of the shorter lifetime components are strongly temperature dependent. Both cis- and trans-PnA show an inversion of the fractional contribution of these two components in a naroow temperature range. The inversion temperature is lower for trans-PnA than for cis-PnA, both in ethanol and in dodecane. The different temperature behavior of the decay of the two PnA isomers can influence their behavior in phospholipids. In L-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and L-α-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) membranes, the emission is more complex, and more than three components are necessary to describe the fluorescence decay accurately. On {{the basis of their}} different behavior in pure solvents, we anticipate that cis-PnA will detect the phospholipid transition in DMPC and DPPC at lower temperature. In fact, this effect has been observed, but it has been attributed to different partitioning of the two isomers in the phospholipid phases rather than to their different photophysics as we suggest here. © 1984, American Chemical Society.

40|$|AbstractThe {{increased}} use of plant sterols as cholesterol-lowering agents warrants further research on the possible effects of plant sterols in membranes. In this study, {{the effects of the}} incorporation of cholesterol, campesterol, β-sitosterol and stigmasterol in phospholipid bilayers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), resonance energy transfer (RET) between trans <b>parinaric</b> <b>acid</b> (tPA) and 2 -(6 -(7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) amino) hexanoyl- 1 -hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (NBD-PC), and Triton X- 100 -induced solubilization. The phospholipids used were 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DPPC), d-erythro-N-palmitoyl-sphingomyelin (PSM), and 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (POPC). In DSC experiments, it was demonstrated that the sterols differed in their effect on the melting temperatures of both the sterol-poor and the sterol-rich domains in DPPC and PSM bilayers. The plant sterols gave rise to lower temperatures of both transitions, when compared with cholesterol. The plant sterols also resulted in lower transition temperatures, in comparison with cholesterol, when sterol-containing DPPC and PSM bilayers were investigated by RET. In the detergent solubilization experiments, the total molar ratio between Triton X- 100 and POPC at the onset of solubilization (Rt,sat) was higher for bilayers containing plant sterols, in comparison with membranes containing cholesterol. Taken together, the observations presented in this study indicate that campesterol, β-sitosterol and stigmasterol interacted less favorably than cholesterol with the phospholipids, leading to measurable differences in their domain properties...|$|E
40|$|Fluorescence of the {{conjugated}} polyene fatty acid, <b>parinaric</b> <b>acid</b> (PnA), was {{studied in}} membranes of Escherichia coli during deenergization by colicin K. The {{free fatty acid}} and biosynthetically esterified forms of cis-PnA (9, 11, 13, 15 -cis,trans,trans,cis-octadecatetraenoic acid), {{both of which are}} sensitive to E. coli lipid-phase transitions, were compared. When free cis-PnA was added exogenously to respiring bacteria, dissipation of the energized state of the membrane resulted in a dramatic increase in cis-PnA fluorescence; all-trans-PnA was much less sensitive. Neither spectral shifts nor a change in cis-PnA fluorescence polarization were observed. Analysis of the PnA content of extracellular fractions of deenergized and control cells revealed a difference in probe distribution: the membranes of energy-poisoned E. coli bound about 77 % of exogenously added cis-PnA, whereas membranes of actively respiring controls bound only about 44 %. No fluorescence enhancement was observed in cells centrifuged to remove unbound cis-PnA before colicin treatment. When cis-PnA was biosynthetically esterified to phospholipids of an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph of E. coli, the fluorescence did not change during membrane deenergization. In double-probe experiments, membrane deenergization resulted in fluorescence enhancement of exogenously added N-phenyl- 1 -naphthylamine, without change in esterified PnA fluorescence. We conclude that deenergization of E. coli membranes leads to increased binding and fluorescence of exogenously added PnA and cannot be detected from within the inner and outer membranes by PnA esterified in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{modification}} of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) represents {{an important factor}} in atherogenesis. In the present study, we have investigated the antioxidant capability of diphenyl diselenide (PhSe) 2, a simple organoseleno compound, against copper (Cu 2 +) and peroxyl radical-induced human LDL oxidation in vitro. In initial studies using human serum, (PhSe) 2 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of Cu 2 +-induced lipid peroxidation, which was correlated to thiol consumption. (PhSe) 2 increased lipid peroxidation lag phase and decreased lipid peroxidation rate in isolated human LDL, evaluated by measuring both conjugated diene (CD) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels. Consistent with these observations, (PhSe) 2 showed a marked inhibitory effect on 2, 2 -azobis(2 -amidinopropane dihydrochloride) (AAPH) -induced oxidation of LDL or <b>parinaric</b> <b>acid</b> (PnA) incorporated into LDL. (PhSe) 2 also displayed a dose-dependent protective effect against Cu 2 +-induced lipid peroxidation in rat aortic slices. Interestingly, besides the antioxidant effects of (PhSe) 2 toward the lipid moieties of LDL, which was related to its thiol-peroxidase activity, protein moieties from human isolated LDL were also protected against Cu 2 +-induced oxidation. The results presented herein are the first to show that (i) (PhSe) 2 inhibits lipid peroxidation in human isolated LDL in vitro, (ii) this phenomenon is related to its thiol-peroxidase activity, and (iii) this chalcogen also prevents the oxidation of protein moieties of human LDL. Taken together, such data render (PhSe) 2 a promising molecule for pharmacological studies with respect to the atherogenic process. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{conjugated}} polyene {{fatty acid}} <b>parinaric</b> <b>acid</b> (PnA) undergoes a stoichiometric loss in fluorescence upon oxidation {{and can be}} used to directly monitor peroxidative stress within lipid environments. We evaluated the course of potentially atherogenic oxidative changes in low density lipoproteins (LDL) by monitoring the oxidation of PnA following its incorporation into buoyant (p = 1. 026 - 1. 032 g/ml) and dense (p = 1. 040 - 1. 054 g/ml) LDL subfractions. Copper-induced oxidation of LDL-associated PnA exhibited an initial lag phase followed by an increased rate of loss until depletion. Increased PnA oxidation occurred immediately after the antioxidants ubiquinol- 10 and alpha-tocopherol were consumed but before there were marked elevations in conjugated dienes. Despite differences in sensitivity to early oxidation events, PnA oxidation and conjugated diene lag times were correlated (r = 0. 582; P = 0. 03), and both indicated a greater susceptibility of dense than buoyant LDL in accordance with previous reports. The greater susceptibility of PnA in dense LDL was attributed to reduced levels of ubiquinol- 10 and alpha-tocopherol, which were approximately 50 % lower than in buoyant LDL (mol of antioxidant/mol of LDL) and together accounted for 80 % of the variation in PnA oxidation lag times. These results suggest that PnA is a useful probe of LDL oxidative susceptibility and may be superior to conjugated dienes for monitoring the initial stages of LDL lipid peroxidation. Differences in oxidative susceptibility among LDL density subfractions are detected by the PnA assay and are {{due in large part to}} differences in their antioxidant content...|$|E
40|$|Intestinal enterocytes contain two {{homologous}} fatty acid-binding proteins, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) 2 {{and liver}} fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP). Since the functional {{basis for this}} multiplicity is not known, the fatty acid-binding specificity of recombinant forms of both rat I-FABP and rat L-FABP was examined. A systematic comparative analysis of the 18 carbon chain length fatty acid binding parameters, using both radiolabeled (stearic, oleic, and linoleic) and fluorescent (trans-parinaric and cis-parinaric) fatty acids, was undertaken. Results obtained with a classical Lipidex- 1000 binding assay, which requires separation of bound from free fatty acid, were confirmed with a fluorescent fatty acid-binding assay not requiring separation of bound and unbound ligand. Depending {{on the nature of}} the fatty acid ligand, I-FABP bound fatty acid had dissociation constants between 0. 2 and 3. 1 [mu] and a consistent 1 : 1 molar ratio. The dissociation constants for L-FABP bound fatty acids ranged between 0. 9 and 2. 6 [mu] and the protein bound up to 2 mol fatty acid per mole of protein. Both fatty acid-binding proteins exhibited relatively higher affinity for unsaturated fatty acids as compared to saturated fatty acids of the same chain length. cis-Parinaric acid or trans-parinaric acid (each containing four double bonds) bound to L-FABP and I-FABP were displaced in a competitive manner by nonfluorescent fatty acid. Hill plots of the binding of cis- and trans- <b>parinaric</b> <b>acid</b> to L-FABP showed that the binding affinities of the two sites were very similar and did not exhibit cooperativity. The lack of fluorescence self-quenching upon binding 2 mol of either trans- or cis- parinaric acid/mol L-FABP is consistent with the presence of two binding sites with dissimilar orientation in the L-FABP. Thus, the difference in binding capacity between I-FABP and L-FABP predicts a structurally different binding site or sites...|$|E
