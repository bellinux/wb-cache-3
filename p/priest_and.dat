His contemporary and friend Jan Kochanowski became one of the greatest Polish poets of all time.|$|E

40|$|This study {{responds}} to the challenge posed by Rossetti’s work to explore the antecedents and consequences of individual differences in happiness among <b>priests</b> <b>and</b> religious sisters. The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire was completed together with measures of personality and work-related psychological health by 95 <b>priests</b> <b>and</b> 61 religious sisters. Overall the data demonstrated high levels of personal happiness among <b>priests</b> <b>and</b> religious sisters, but also significant signs of vulnerability. Personality provided significant prediction of individual differences in both personal happiness and work-related psychological health. However, personal happiness provided additional protection against work-related emotional exhaustion and additional enhancement of work-related satisfaction. These findings suggest that acknowledging and affirming personal happiness may enhance the work-related psychological health of Catholic <b>priests</b> <b>and</b> religious sisters...|$|R
