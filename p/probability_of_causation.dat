Starting from structural-semantical definitions of the probabilities of necessary or sufficient causation (or both), we show how to bound these quantities from data obtained in experimental and observational studies, under general assumptions concerning the data-generating process. In particular, we strengthen the results of Pearl (1999) by presenting sharp bounds based on combined experimental and nonexperimental data under no process assumptions, as well as under the mild assumptions of exogeneity (no confounding) and monotonicity (no prevention).

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{recent advances}} in causal inference and underscores the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special {{emphasis is placed on}} the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000 a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes <b>of</b> effects, and <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Situations {{in which}} there is {{uncertainty}} over the cause of harm are studied (e. g., was the lung cancer due to normal exposure to medical x-radiation, to smoking, to exposure to carcinogens discharged by a chemical plant?); and the effects on incentives to reduce risk of various ways of treating such uncertainty under the liability system are identified using a theoretical model of the occurrence of harm. The main points are these. Use of a threshold probabilit' of causation (e. g., 50 %) as a criterion for determining liability may adversely affect behavior: parties might face a diminished burden of liability (if their <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> systematically fell below the threshold) and thus do too little to reduce risk; or they might face an extra burden (if their probability were systematically above the threshold), and thus do too much. Second, the best all or nothing criterion for determining liability (a criterion under which a party is fully liable if at all liable) is different in form from a threshold probability criterion. Third, liability in proportion to the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> is superior to all other criteria and results in socially ideal behavior. These points are demonstrated and analyzed in two types of case: where the uncertainty involves a party versus natural or "background" factors; and where it involves which party among several was the author of harm. The importance of the points is shown to depend on the type of case, and as well on the form of liability (strict liability or the negligence rule). The interpretation of the analysis and important qualifications to it are discussed in a concluding section. ...|$|E
40|$|On roads showing {{significant}} {{violations of}} posted speed limits, {{one measure of}} the safety effect of speeding {{is the difference between}} the road's actual accident count and the count that would have occurred if the posted speed limit had been strictly obeyed. An estimate of this accident reduction can be had by computing the probability that speeding was a necessary condition for each of set of accidents. This is an instance <b>of</b> assessing individual <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation,</b> which is generally not possible absent prior knowledge of causal structure. For traffic accidents such prior knowledge is often available and this paper illustrates how, for a commonly occurring class of vehicle/pedestrian accidents, approaches to uncertainty and causal analyses appearing in the accident reconstruction literature can be unified using Bayesian networks. Measured skidmarks, pedestrian throw distances, and pedestrian injury severity are treated as evidence, and using the Gibbs Sampling routine BUGS, the posterior probability distribution over exogenous variables, such as the vehicle's initial speed, location, and driver reaction time, is computed. This posterior distribution is then used to compute the "probability of necessity" for speeding.

40|$|Courts {{around the}} world are {{increasingly}} considering whether liability should exist in various types of situations in which a plaintiff can prove that a defendant’s tortious conduct {{may have contributed to the}} plaintiff’s injury, but it is inherently impossible, given the nature of the situation, for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant’s tortious conduct actually contributed to the injury. The problematic nature of the causal issue is usually recognized when the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> is not greater than 50 percent, with courts adopting different views, depending on the type of situation, on whether liability nevertheless is appropriate and, if so, whether liability should be full or only proportionate to the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation.</b> However, when the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> is only slightly higher—greater than 50 percent—many courts do not view either causation or liability as being problematic. Indeed, under the commonly accepted version of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine, liability is assumed to be unproblematic even though the only indication of negligent conduct as well as causation is a mere 50 + percent ex ante statistical probability. The dramatic difference in treatment of situations that are identical except for a trivial difference in statistical probability is due to an unexamined assumption that the usual “preponderance of the evidence” or “balance of probabilities” burden of persuasion in civil cases merely requires proof of a 50 + percent statistical probability. This assumption, which is common among academics as well as courts but is rejected by courts when the statistical rather than case-specific nature of the probability is obvious, has led to inconsistent and incoherent treatment of normatively and descriptively analogous types of situations and even to erroneous denials of proof of causation and liability in some situations in which tortious causation clearly exists. The statistical probability interpretation of the burden of persuasion in civil cases is inconsistent with the traditional understanding of that burden, which instead requires the formation of a minimal degree of belief, based on evidence specific to the particular occasion, in the actual existence of the disputed fact in the particular situation. When the disputed fact is actual causation of injury, there must be a minimal belief that the causal law underlying the allegedly applicable causal generalization was fully instantiated on the particular occasion. General statistics cannot support such a belief; only concrete evidence specific to the particular situation can do so. Only when the burden of persuasion is correctly understood can many currently debated issues regarding the existence and scope of tort liability be properly understood and consistently resolved. When the various types of problematic situations are compared, it turns out that the market share liability principles adopted in Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories and, arguably, Hymowitz v. Eli Lilly 2 ̆ 6 Co., which are highly controversial, are more defensible than the liability principles that are widely employed in the alternative causation cases, the medical malpractice lost-chance cases, the toxic tort cases, and, especially, in the usual formulation of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine...|$|E

40|$|Introduction] According to {{probabilistic}} theories <b>of</b> <b>causation,</b> causes {{raise the}} <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> their effects. Opponents of probabilistic theories <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> offer putative counterexamples. A moment's reflection should {{lead us to}} expect such counterexamples to be of two types: (1) causes that appear not to raise the <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> their effects; and (2) events that appear to raise the <b>probabilities</b> <b>of</b> other events, without causing those events. Almost all of the cases that have been discussed in the literature have been of the first sort; these can be effectively handled using resources that are already available. Counterexamples of the second sort, which have been largely ignored, still pose a threat.

An important question concerns {{the likelihood of a}} causal association between a crew members radiation exposure and the occurrence of cancer.

An important conclusion from our analysis is that the NASA policy to limit the risk of exposure-induced death to 3 % at the 95 % confidence level largely ensures that estimates of the PC for most cancer types would not reach a level of significance.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} four main {{arguments}} about the nature <b>of</b> <b>causation</b> in the social sciences.

Here, it is helpful to distinguish between the formal properties of a causal argument and the methods by which such an argument might be tested, the research design.
