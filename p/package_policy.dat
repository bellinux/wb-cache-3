In this paper, we evaluate the material impacts of <b>packaging</b> <b>policy</b> in The Netherlands, focusing on the role of material efficiency (or waste prevention). Since 1991, five different policies have been implemented to reduce the environmental impact of packaging. The analysis shows that Dutch <b>packaging</b> <b>policies</b> helped to reduce the total packaging volume until 1999. After 2000, packaging consumption increased more rapidly than the baseline, suggesting that policy measures were not effective. Generally, we see limited attention to material efficiency to reduce packaging material use. For this purpose, we tried to gain more insight in recent activities on material efficiency, by building a database of packaging prevention initiatives. We identified 131 alterations to packaging implemented in the period 2005 – 2010, of which weight reduction was the predominant approach. More appropriate <b>packaging</b> <b>policy</b> is needed to increase the effectiveness of policies, with special attention to material efficiency...|$|R

This paper evaluates the material impacts <b>packaging</b> <b>policy</b> in The Netherlands in the period 1986 – 2007. Five different voluntary agreements were implemented over this period to reduce the environmental impact of packaging. The analysis shows that among the investigated indicators, population statistically is the most robust indicator to estimate the packaging demand. A baseline is developed on the basis of population growth in The Netherlands, and is used as reference to evaluate policy impacts. The policy periods are evaluated on the basis of overall effectiveness compared to the baseline and target achievement. Dutch <b>packaging</b> <b>policies</b> have been effective to reduce the total packaging volume until 1999. After 2000, packaging consumption increased more rapidly than the baseline, suggesting that policy measures have not been effective. The largest increase in packaging recycling rates was achieved during the first policy period.

40|$|Although the {{successful}} {{design and implementation}} of a <b>policy</b> <b>package</b> (i. e. a combination of individual policy measures to reach one or more goals) is a great challenge it offers the chance to avoid unwanted effects which may arise from the introduction of single measures. Although each potential <b>policy</b> <b>package</b> is faced with different starting conditions, some approaches in <b>policy</b> <b>package</b> design may lead to better results than others. In order to identify these, a methodology was set up that supports the systematic evaluation {{of different types of}} <b>policy</b> <b>packages</b> in transportation. Best practice in the context of <b>policy</b> <b>package</b> design is, on the one hand, related to the creation of <b>policy</b> <b>packages,</b> e. g. <b>policy</b> goals definition, involvement of relevant groups, consideration of overall policy goals which may go beyond those addressed in the <b>policy</b> <b>package</b> (e. g. economic growth, welfare, and environment), consideration of unintended/adverse effects and measures to eliminate them or at least mitigate them as much as possible, efficient discussion process, broad consensus on the result, willingness to implement, and so forth. On the other hand the analysis of best practice must also look at the results after implementation. This addresses questions such as did the <b>policy</b> <b>package</b> achieve the anticipated results in the time foreseen, was it designed {{in such a way that}} it allowed adjustment to different possible developments, did it lead to any unwanted effects, did the implementation go according to plan and with the necessary acceptance, and so forth.

40|$|Potato {{production}} {{plays an}} important role in improving household income and nutrition and thereby contributes to food security. Despite of this, the current productivity of the crop is below the potential. Low level of use of improved potato technology package is among the causes for low productivity. In this context, this study analysed the factors influencing adoption of potato technology package by smallholder farmers in Gurawa, Haramaya, Kombolcha, Meta, and Habro districts of Eastern Ethiopia. The analysis was based on a household survey conducted on 214 randomly selected potato growing households. A two-limit Tobit model was used to analyse the factors affecting adoption which is measured in an index computed from five components of the technology package. Variation in districts, access to irrigation, farm size, membership to cooperatives, and annual income of the households were found to significantly affect the adoption of potato technology <b>package.</b> <b>Policy</b> makers, planners and development practitioners are required to give due attention to these determinants in order to support smallholder farmers in production and productivity improvements from potato production...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a change}} to European Union (EU) telecoms law which de facto permits operators to impose restrictions on network traffic, and which enables such restrictions {{to be imposed}} {{for the purposes of}} copyright enforcement—thus it simultaneously facilitates two different policy agendas from the copyright and telecoms industries—‘three-strikes’ as well as ‘traffic management. ’ The mechanism is a provision concerning users’ contracts, supported by generic provisions addressed to EU governments and regulators. The change went into law in late 2009, within the so-called ‘Telecoms Package,’ which, together with the E-commerce directive, establishes the EU legal framework for telecoms networks. In terms of the latest initiative on IP Enforcement, ACTA, this is the much-cited EU aquis communitaire, with which ACTA must comply. This paper addresses how the change came into being and possible interpretations and implications for copyright enforcement policy.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the paternalistic {{justification of}} the world’s first mandatory tobacco plain <b>packaging</b> <b>policy,</b> which came into force in Australia in 2012.

Understanding the paternalistic dimension of the policy is therefore of imminent international importance. The policy meets important ethical benchmarks such as respect for citizens’ self-interests and protection of others against harm. However, plain packaging faces a number of ethical challenges: the policy is a controversial type of paternalism; it runs partially against the harm principle; and it fails to meet key operational criteria...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pragmatic approach {{for reducing the}} environmental impacts of transport in the German Federal State Saxony. The aim is to use the potential of pricing measures for effectively reducing environmental impacts of transport.

Second, a <b>policy</b> <b>package</b> reducing these external costs is composed. Third, the development of the external costs is assessed and compared in two scenarios, a BAU-scenario and the policy scenario where measures reducing {{the environmental impacts of}} transport are implemented. Fourth, the public and political acceptability of this <b>policy</b> <b>package</b> are investigated. The results show {{that it is possible to}} develop a <b>policy</b> <b>package</b> that is effective for reducing the environmental impacts as well as acceptable to the public and politicians. Therefore, such a package approach is suitable to guide future political decisions and actions towards a more sustainable transport sector...|$|R

This paper contributes to the debate by examining these programs in a model where the host country government maximizes its objective function with respect to three policy instruments: the share of migrants' deferred income payment, the value of the bond employers must post and forfeit if GWs overstay, and the size of the program. Circular migration and illegal GWs' status regularization are considered. The paper shows that i) the optimal value of the bond is zero, ii) Mode IV is preferable to GW migration; iii) the optimal <b>policy</b> <b>package</b> consists of Mode IV and permanent migration, and iv) incorporating circular migration improves the <b>policy</b> <b>package.</b> Additional <b>policy</b> implications are also provided...|$|R
