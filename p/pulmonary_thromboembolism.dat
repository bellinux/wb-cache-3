Pitt {{suffered}} from psychotic symptoms requiring anti-psychotics and allegedly may have suffered from Asperger syndrome. Pitt was a patient of Dr David Brown between 1995 and 1997, who prescribed him various drugs to treat his symptoms. However, Pitt and his parents believed that he should have been prescribed anti-depressants and were opposed to him being forced to take the medication. It was heard at the inquiry that Pitt did not take the medication or respond to any prescriptions made out to him, additionally he did not see Dr David Brown for four years after 1997. He returned to Gartnavel Royal Hospital in 2001 after his condition failed to improve and was again prescribed medication which he refused to take; he was then prescribed alternative drugs and given two [...] CT scans and a consultation with a psychologist. In 2003 Pitt was admitted to the McNair ward of Gartnavel Royal Hospital. Dr David Brown believed Pitt may require forcibly injected medicine if he continued to refuse his oral medication. However, his condition improved after an alternative prescription which Pitt agreed to take. During this stay, Pitt refused food and fluids given to him by hospital staff but accepted some from his parents. Dr June Ellison requested that the hospital and Pitt’s parents maintain a fluid balance chart. It was found, after Pitt’s death, that the fluid balance charts were maintained poorly and on some days had no entry at all. Pitt was found to be suffering from dehydration on 28 May 2003 and spent long periods of time lying in his bed. Kenneth Pitt’s father, Hugh Pitt, requested that he be given physiotherapy but this was not provided. The same day Pitt was found collapsed in his en-suite bathroom and could not be revived, he was transported to and pronounced dead in the Western Infirmary where he was given active resuscitation.

5000|$|Virchow is {{also known}} for elucidating the {{mechanism}} of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thromboembolism</b> (a condition of blood clotting in the blood vessels), coining the terms embolism and thrombosis. He noted that blood clots in the pulmonary artery originate first from venous thrombi, stating in 1859: [...] "The detachment of larger or smaller fragments {{from the end of}} the softening thrombus which are carried along by the current of blood and driven into remote vessels. This gives rise to the very frequent process on which I have bestowed the name of Embolia." [...] Having made these initial discoveries based on autopsies, he proceeded to put forward a scientific hypothesis; that pulmonary thrombi are transported from the veins of the leg and that the blood has the ability to carry such an object. He then proceeded to prove this hypothesis through well-designed experiments, repeated numerous times to consolidate evidence, and with meticulously detailed methodology. This work rebuked a claim made by the eminent French pathologist Jean Cruveilhier that phlebitis led to clot development and therefore coagulation was the main consequence of venous inflammation. This was a view held by many before Virchow's work. Related to this research, Virchow described the factors contributing to venous thrombosis, Virchow's triad.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{spite of}} the {{benefits}} of autopsies, there has been in recent years a drastic {{decline in the number of}} autopsies performed, mainly due to an apparent unattractive cost-benefit ratio and fears of the medico-legal consequences. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the reports of all the 879 consecutive autopsies performed at "Policlinico of Bari" from 1990 to 2009. RESULTS: All clinical diagnoses were compared with autopsy findings showing 558 concordant diagnoses (most of all neoplasms); 123 certain discordant diagnoses (69 of them with potential impact on survival, such as acute myocardial infarctions, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thromboembolisms,</b> internal haemorrhages, surgery complications, aortic aneurism ruptures, and so on); 116 uncertain discrepant diagnoses; 82 unclear diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of discrepancy allows the authors to hypothesize that a better diagnostic assessment could lead to a different outcome. In terms of risk-management this negative performance needs to be carefully analysed and requires a comprehensive audit of all services provided. In this sense, the authors underline the crucial importance of autopsy as an essential tool to address unresolved clinical questions and highlight previously undiagnosed medical conditions...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Up-regulated matrix metalloproteinases may be {{involved}} in the development of cardiomyocyte injury and the degradation of troponin associated with acute <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thromboembolism.</b> We examined whether pretreatment with doxycycline (a nonspecific matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor) protects against cardiomyocyte injury associated with acute <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thromboembolism.</b> Design: Controlled animal study. Setting: University research laboratory. Subjects: Mongrel dogs. Interventions: Anesthetized animals received doxycycline (10 mg/kg intravenously) or saline and acute <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thromboembolism</b> was induced with autologous blood clots injected into the right atrium. Control animals received doxycycline (or saline). Measurements and Main Results: Hemodynamic measurements were performed, and acute <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thromboembolism</b> increased baseline mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance by approximately 160 % and 362 %, respectively (both p 100 % (p<. 05), and this finding was confirmed by in situ zymography of the right ventricle. Doxycycline attenuated acute pulmonary thromboembolism-induced increases in right ventricle matrix metalloproteinase activities. Acute <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thromboembolism</b> induced neutrophil accumulation in the right ventricle, as estimated by myeloperoxidase activity, and doxycycline blunted this effect (p<. 05). Serum cardiac troponin I concentrations, which reflect cardiomyocyte injury, increased after acute <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thromboembolism,</b> and this increase was attenuated by pretreatment with doxycycline (p<. 05). Conclusions: We found evidence supporting the idea that acute <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thromboembolism</b> is associated with increased matrix metalloproteinase activities in the right ventricle, which may lead to degradation of sarcomeric proteins, including cardiac troponin I.

Deep venous thrombosis of lower extremities is the most common site of origin, which initially may remain obscure. Case report Two weeks prior to admission the patient had right-sided chest pain accompanied with dyspnea, interpreted and treated as pleuropneumonia. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>thromboembolism</b> was suspected due to clinical symptoms, chest X-ray, elevated enzyme levels findings, blood gas analysis with hypoxemia and ECG with right heart overload. The diagnosis of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>thromboembolism</b> confirmed by lung scintigraphy presented with perfusion defects. After twenty days of heparin therapy, the patient developed left leg edema. Ultrasound screening confirmed bilateral iliac-femoral popliteal vein thrombosis of iliacofemoropopliteal veins bilaterally. Phlebography performed via jugular vein disclosed thrombotic material in the right common iliac vein, {{as well as in the}} vena cava inferior. In the course of the procedure vena cava filter has been placed.

Subjects and methods. The authors analyzed 28 cases of PATE without lowered blood pressure (BP) on primary examination in the prehospital stage (systolic BP (SBP) was less than 100 mm Hg). The study enrolled 17 men and 11 women; their mean age was 67. 5 ± 14. 5 years. The clinical and ECG pattern was compared on primary examination and over time (following an average of 87 ± 29. 7 min). Results.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} of heartworm treatment {{is to improve}} the clinical condition of the patient and to eliminate pre-cardiac, juvenile, and adult worm stages with minimal complications. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>thromboembolisms</b> are an inevitable consequence of worm death and can result in severe pulmonary reactions and even death of the patient. To minimize these reactions, various treatment protocols involving melarsomine, the only adulticidal drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administrations (FDA), in conjunction with macrocyclic lactone heartworm preventives and glucocorticosteroids have been advocated. The discovery of the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia in Dirofilaria immitis has led to several experimental studies examining the effects of administering doxycycline to reduce or eliminate Wolbachia organism. These studies have shown a decrease in gross and microscopic pathology of pulmonary parenchyma in experimental heartworm infections pretreated with doxycycline before melarsomine administration. Methods Electronic medical records from a large veterinary practice in northeast Alabama were searched to identify dogs treated for heartworms with melarsomine from January 2005 through December 2012. The search was refined further to select for dogs that met the following criteria: 1) received two or three doses of ivermectin heartworm preventive prior to melarsomine injections, 2) received one injection of melarsomine followed by two injections 4 to 8  weeks later, and 3) were treated with prednisone following melarsomine injections. The dogs were then divided into those that also were treated with doxycycline 10  mg/kg BID for 4  weeks (Group A, n =  47) and those that did not receive doxycycline (Group B, n =  47). The medical notes of all 94 cases were then reviewed for comments concerning coughing, dyspnea, or hemoptysis in the history, physical exam template, or from telephone conversations with clients the week following each visit. Any dog that died within one year of treatment from either cardiovascular or pulmonary problems was noted.
