The ANAMMOX granules could be divided into settling and floating granules. The settling <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> an average diameter of 2. 96 ± 0. 99 mm were smaller than the floating <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> an average diameter of 4. 58 ± 1. 22 mm. A settling model was established and validated to correlate the settling velocity with the density (ρG), mass shape factor (ψmass), shape-correction factor (characterized by sphericity (Φ′) or roundness (ξ)) and projected area equivalent sphere diameter (dP) of ANAMMOX granules. The sphericity was more suitable than the roundness for describing the settling behavior. The sensitivity of four parameters was {{in the order of}} ρG, ψmass, dP and Φ′.

Independent of the granulation technique, technologically developed granules presented particle diameter, bulk and tapped densities and compressibility indexes suitable for a solid dosage form. The compression behavior showed plastic and fragmentary deformation for granules produced by the dry granulation technique and predominantly plastic deformation for wet granulation.

40|$|Main {{conclusion}} - Expression of amylosucrase in potato {{resulted in}} larger starch <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> rough surfaces and novel physico-chemical properties, including improved freeze–thaw stability, higher end viscosity, and better enzymatic digestibility. Starch {{is a very}} important carbohydrate in many food and non-food applications. In planta modification of starch by genetic engineering has significant economic and environmental benefits as it makes the chemical or physical post-harvest modification obsolete. An amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea fused to a starch-binding domain (SBD) was introduced in two potato genetic backgrounds to synthesize starch <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> altered composition, and thereby to broaden starch applications. Expression of SBD–amylosucrase fusion protein in the amylose-containing potato resulted in starch <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> a rough surface, a twofold increase in median granule size, and altered physico-chemical properties including improved freeze–thaw stability, higher end viscosity, and better enzymatic digestibility. These effects are possibly a result of the physical interaction between amylosucrase and starch granules. The modified larger starches not only have great benefit to the potato starch industry by reducing losses during starch isolation, but also have an advantage in many food applications such as frozen food due to its extremely high freeze–thaw stability...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing {{carbon fiber}} amperometry, we {{exploited}} the natural variation in quantal size (Q) among individual granules in rat chromaffin cells {{to examine the}} influence of Q on quantal release kinetics. Although it is generally accepted that <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> larger Q have slower kinetics of release, we found that this trend was applicable only to <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> Q 1 / 3 < 0. 6 pC 1 / 3. <b>Granules</b> <b>with</b> larger Q adapted specific mechanisms to maintain a rapid kinetic of release. The semistable fusion pores in the large-Q granules persisted for a longer duration and could reach a bigger size {{before the onset of}} very rapid dilation to allow a longer and larger foot signal. Most importantly, a large proportion of large-Q granules maintained a relatively short half-width in the main spike. This suggests that the most rapid phase of fusion pore dilation in many large-Q granules may be faster than that in small-Q granules. Moreover, cAMP selectively advanced the onset of the rapid dilation of the fusion pore in the large- but not the small-Q granules. Thus, our finding raises the possibility that fusion pore and/or granule matrix in small- and large-Q granules may have different molecular structures...|$|R

In the fimbriae two types of secretory cells were observed: one possessed secretory <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> electron-lucent matrices, prominent protrusions and many electron-dense granules resembling lipid droplets, and the other possessed many secretory <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> moderately electron-dense, homogeneous matrices, occasionally containing an electron-dense area. The former type was only observed in the fimbrial epithelium, while the latter was present in both the fimbriae and the infundibulum.

Electron-dense areas were frequently observed in many secretory granules of the isthmic cells. Lysosome-like vesicles, partly filled with a dense substance and/or a finely granular substance, were observed in the infranuclear cytoplasm of the isthmic cells. Fusion between vesicles and secretory granules was frequently observed.

40|$|Three {{sequencing}} batch reactors, R 1, R 2 and R 3, with a 1. 5 -h, 4 -h and 8 -h cycle time, respectively, {{were used}} to cultivate aerobic <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> the same synthetic wastewater containing 1000 mg l? 1 COD. As the initial COD concentrations in the cycles were the same, three different cycle times led to three different starvation times in repeated cycles of the three reactors. It was found that 63 cycles were needed to form <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> the longest starvation time in R 3 while it took 256 cycles in R 1 with the shortest starvation time. However, {{as far as the}} formation time was concerned, granules were formed on day 16 with 1. 5 -h cycle time while on day 21 with 8 -h cycle time, which indicated that a shorter cycle time with a shorter starvation time speeded up the granulation.

This resulted in the improved compatibility of the starch granules and PBAT matrix in the blends as confirmed by SEM...|$|R
40|$|At the moment, {{little is}} known about the {{molecular}} characteristics of the final step in the process of regulated exocytosis, i. e. the fusion of the membrane of a secretory vesicle with the plasma membrane. We have reconstituted this fusion event in vitro, using zymogen granules and plasma membranes from the exocrine pancreas of the rat. The membranes of zymogen <b>granules</b> were loaded <b>with</b> the lipid-soluble fluorescent probe octadecylrhodamine B, at a concentration that resulted in self-quenching of its fluorescence. The granules were then incubated with pancreatic plasma membranes at 37 degrees C, and fusion was measured through the dilution-dependent de-quenching of the fluorescence of the probe. Zymogen <b>granules</b> fused <b>with</b> pancreatic plasma membranes, but not with plasma membranes from liver or chromaffin cells; <b>granules</b> also fused <b>with</b> unlabelled <b>granule</b> membranes. The fusion of <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> plasma membranes was unaffected by variation of the Ca 2 + concentration over a wide range, but fusion of <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> both plasma membranes and zymogen granule membranes was stimulated by GTP and, more potently, by guanosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]). The effect of GTP[S] was to increase the extent of fusion occurring at low concentrations of plasma membranes, without affecting the maximum signal obtained at high membrane concentrations. Pre-incubation of the plasma membranes with GTP[S] also enhanced their ability to fuse <b>with</b> zymogen <b>granules.</b> Our results indicate that membrane fusion during exocytosis may be under the direct control of a GTP-binding protein...|$|R

40|$|Mast {{cells were}} enzymatically dissociated from human lung {{fragments}} {{that had been}} sensitized with serum from human allergic to ragweed and were enriched by isopyknic and velocity gradient sedimentation. Electron microscope examination showed that the mast cells were well preserved {{at the end of}} the dissociation and isolation and that the majority of their secretory granules contained crystalline structures. These structures exhibited three patterns [...] scrolls, gratings, and lattices [...] which all could be found in the same granule. The period of crystalline structures was found to be bimodal, with maxima at 150 and 75 A. Both periods were observed in gratings that had been tilted and in scrolls that had been cut obliquely, indicating that the various gross patterns are composed of the same basic substructure. After the mast cells were stimulated by rabbit anti-human IgE to release histamine, the contents of the granule were transformed from a crystalline to an amorphous state, and only <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> amorphous contents were seen discharging from the cell. Clusters of intermediate filaments were present around the <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> amorphous contents, both deep in the cytoplasm and discharging at the cell surface. Discharge occurred both by fusion of <b>granule</b> membranes <b>with</b> the plasma membrane and by fusion of <b>granule</b> membranes <b>with</b> other <b>granule</b> membranes that ultimately were continuous with the plasma membrane. After discharge, the granule residue was fibrillar. Cells challenged with anti-human IgE in calcium-free medium neither released histamine nor demonstrated morphologic changes in their granules.

We found that most apparently docked granules did not fuse with the plasma membrane after stimulation. Granules that did fuse typically fused completely, but a few dextran-filled granules lingered at the membrane. Direct recycling of granules occurred only rarely. Similar results were obtained with both confocal and total internal reflection microscopy, although each technique had advantages for particular aspects of the granule life cycle.

Binding of granules to actin was unaffected by cyclic AMP or by preincubation of the <b>granules</b> <b>with</b> phospholipase C.
