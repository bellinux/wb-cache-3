25|$|Puducherry {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular tourist spots for {{national}} and international tourists. Out of 274 Paadal Petra Sthalam Shiva Temples, the Puducherry region is owning 1 temple and in Karaikal regions it is having 4 temples which itself a clear proof that the Puducherry territory is also a part of the spiritual and sacramental of Shaivism principles. Besides in Villianur, Bahour and in so many areas of Puducherry region there are so many Shiva temples built up during the golden period of King Chola empire which gives immense <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proud of that our Puducherry territory was administered under the control of such golden rulers.

A unique experimental city Auroville, the brainchild of the Mother, whose inhabitants are drawn from all parts of the world is situated on the outskirts of the city. There are several temples, churches, monuments, parks and mosques which attract tourists.|$|E

[...] He wrote: [...] "In fact, tedium is a frequent bedfellow in Cannon Fodder 3", {{due to the lack of}} variety in the gameplay and mission objectives. He felt the player's vehicles to be of limited effectiveness as is the ability to split the squad. Cocks complained of the game's [...] "bargain basement production" [...] ruining the tone of the game due to low quality translations and voice acting, as well as numerous bugs causing problems with running the game, crashes, spawning and using vehicles. The reviewer acknowledged the [...] "wonderfully cartoony" [...] graphics, found the gory windscreen wipers [...] "amusing" [...] and wrote [...] "It’s all over-the-top explosive goodness and contributes a great deal to what little appeal is present."

500|$|By 1610, Fuller was {{considered}} an [...] "elder statesman" [...] within Parliament, [...] "although his influence may have been somewhat weakened by the bruising encounters with high commission and star chamber". He introduced two bills to reform or remove ecclesiastical committees and courts, which passed in the House of Commons of England on 21 May and 20 June, though both were later rejected by the Lords. On 3 November he began campaigning to have customs duties put into a statutory framework, again against the Court of High Commission, which, he claimed, as an unelected and autonomous body could not be trusted, but rather Parliament should be given jurisdiction. In a speech on 23 June 1610 he said that [...] "the laws of England are the most high inheritance of the land, whereby both king and subjects are directed and guided". Customs were [...] "not at the king’s <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> increased {{without the consent of}} the subjects", and [...] "impositions and customs laid on subjects’ goods and merchandise...was always done by several acts of parliament". Wright notes that this was apparently greeted with complete silence, possibly because, while the MPs agreed that civil liberties had been eroded, they felt it was too dangerous to reclaim them. On 23 February 1620, Fuller died at his home, Chamberhouse, at Crookham in Thatcham, Berkshire and was buried at the village's parish church on 2 March. Most of his estate was passed to his wife, Sarah (sister of Samuel Backhouse MP), and his eldest son, Nicholas, who died only four months later, leaving a three-year-old son.|$|E

[...] Richard Schickel of Time also enjoyed Murphy's role, stating [...] "No one has ever made a funnier jackass of himself than Murphy." [...] Peter Rainer of New York magazine liked the script, also stating [...] "The animation, directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is often on the same wriggly, giggly level as the script, although the more [...] "human" [...] characters, such as Princess Fiona and Lord Farquaad, are less interesting than the animals and creatures—a common pitfall in animated films of all types." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote [...] "Shrek is a world-class charmer that could even seduce the Academy when it hands out the first official animation Oscar next year." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Shrek is not a guilty pleasure for sophisticated movie-goers; it is, purely and simply, a pleasure." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "The witty, fractured fairy tale Shrek has a solid base of clever writing."
