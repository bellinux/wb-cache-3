5|$|In May 2001, it was {{announced}} that Sony Pictures Entertainment would distribute the film in North America. It was suggested by Capcom executives that the film would not be released in 2001, but rather in 2002, which was later confirmed by Sony in August 2001. The film was set for release on 5 April 2002 before being <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> to a 15 March release.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1862, , {{commanded}} by Commander Franklin Buchanan, {{was ready to}} engage the Union flotilla blockading the James River. Virginia was powered by Merrimack's original engines, which had been condemned by the Union Navy before her capture. The ship's chief engineer, H. Ashton Ramsay, served in Merrimack before the Civil War broke out and knew of the engine's unreliability, but Buchanan <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> undaunted.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of July 17–18, Major Bruce made a {{personal}} reconnaissance ahead of his troops through heavy flanking machine-gun fire. He <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> to the outpost lines through heavy artillery and machine-gun fire {{to keep in touch}} with all his company. On October 3–4 he made a personal reconnaissance on the left flank of his division through heavy shell fire and continual sniping and gained information which enabled him to well place his battalion and cover an exposed flank.|$|E
40|$|In a semi-abelian category, we give a {{categorical}} {{construction of}} the <b>push</b> <b>forward</b> of an internal pre-crossed module, generalizing the pushout of a short exact sequence in abelian categories. The main properties of the <b>push</b> <b>forward</b> are discussed. A simplified version is given for action accessible categories, providing examples in the categories of rings and Lie algebras. We show that <b>push</b> <b>forwards</b> {{can be used to}} obtain the crossed module version of the comprehensive factorization for internal groupoids...|$|R

5|$|The Leader {{project was}} part of Bulleid's desire to modernise the steam {{locomotive}} based on experience gained with the Southern Railway's fleet of electric stock. Bulleid considered that attitudes towards the labour-intensity of steam operation had changed during the post-war period, favouring dieselisation and electrification. In an effort to demonstrate the continued potential of steam, Bulleid <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> the boundaries of steam-power, allowing it to compete with diesel and electric locomotives in terms of labour-saving and ease of operation.|$|E
5|$|The action {{could not}} be opened until a slight forward {{movement}} of the slide handle released the action slide lock. In firing, the recoil of the shotgun gave a slight forward motion to the slide handle and released the action slide lock which enabled immediate opening of the action. In {{the absence of any}} recoil, the slide handle had to be <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> manually in order to release the action slide lock.|$|E
5|$|Anderlecht {{began the}} second half the better of the two sides as they <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> {{in an attempt to}} extend their lead. Rensenbrink, in particular, was in good form as he caused {{numerous}} problems for Liverpool defender Emlyn Hughes, who started because of an injury to Phil Thompson after being absent himself for a lengthy period. Liverpool replaced David Johnson with midfielder Steve Heighway in an attempt {{to get back into the}} match but it was to no avail as Anderlecht extended their lead late in {{the second half}} when Rensenbrink scored. No further goals were scored and the referee Károly Palotai blew for full-time with the final score 3–1 to Anderlecht.|$|E

5|$|Beginning April 27, 2015, Cawthon posted {{images on}} his website teasing at another {{game in the}} series, {{originally}} known as Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter. A trailer was released on July 13, 2015, hinting that the game {{took place in the}} main character's house. Five Nights at Freddy's 4 was first announced with a release date of October 31, 2015, before being <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> to August 8, 2015, and again to July 23 of the same year, when the game was unexpectedly released on Microsoft Windows through Steam. Android and iOS ports were released on July 25, 2015 and August 3, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Between 1822 and 1848 Bute {{played a}} central role in the {{creation}} of the Cardiff Docks. The idea was first put forward to Bute by one of his staff in 1822, who suggested that, with the right investment, Cardiff could be transformed into a major port for exporting coal and iron. The existing seaport, used by the Glamorganshire Canal, was small and inefficient. The new port would then deliver a direct return to Bute from shipping rates, improve the value of his lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields. Initially Bute opposed plans for docks put forward by the local ironmasters, but then changed his mind and <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> with his own scheme shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while Western Allies entered western Germany {{and closed}} to the Rhine river. By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine {{north and south of}} the Ruhr, {{encircling}} the German Army Group B, while the Soviets advanced to Vienna. In early April, the Western Allies finally <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg, while Soviet and Polish forces stormed Berlin in late April. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April. On 30 April 1945, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, {{the sport}} was <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> by American {{mathematician}} John Gill, who contributed several important innovations. Gill's previous athletic pursuit was gymnastics, a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for particular movements and body positions. He applied this idea to bouldering, which shifted the focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds. Gill developed a closed-ended rating system: B1 problems were {{as difficult as}} the most challenging roped routes of the time, B2 problems were more difficult, and B3 problems were those that had only been completed once.|$|E
5|$|Ironclads were {{designed}} for several roles, including as high seas battleships, coastal defense ships, and long-range cruisers. The rapid development of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> {{by the development of}} heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea at the time), more sophisticated steam engines, and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible.|$|E
5|$|Lee's army now dug {{in around}} Petersburg, Virginia {{and the long}} Siege of Petersburg {{commenced}} with several frontal assaults on the Confederate position. The 22nd {{took part in the}} assault on June 18, 1864. Again the regiment was deployed as skirmishers in front of their brigade. They were ordered to take a ravine alongside the Norfolk Railroad. Advancing at a run in the face of heavy canister fire, the 22nd reached the ravine. However, in that position they were subjected to severe musket and artillery fire from the Confederates, and so they <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> to the Norfolk Railroad cut, forcing the Confederates back to their entrenchments. In the assault on Petersburg, the 22nd lost seven killed and 14 wounded.|$|E

5|$|Shortly afterwards, Wark {{observed}} {{a battery of}} German 77mm guns firing on his rear companies, causing heavy casualties. Collecting a party of his men, he rushed the battery and succeeded in capturing four guns in conjunction with ten crewmen. With only two men, he <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> and surprised fifty Germans near Magny-la-Fosse who subsequently surrendered. At 15:00, he halted his battalion near Joncourt, and sent out patrols which found the town still occupied by enemy forces. The 32nd Battalion responded by withdrawing slightly and strengthening its line. At 17:30, the Germans launched a counter-attack that was repulsed {{with the assistance of}} the 31st Battalion, together with some men from the 46th (North Midland) Division.|$|E
5|$|Supplies for {{the advance}} were transported over land and by sea {{but it was}} only with great {{difficulty}} that two infantry divisions of XXI Corps and three mounted divisions of Desert Mounted Corps were maintained in the advance at such distances from base. The Navy transported stores to the mouths of the Wadi Hesi and the Nahr Sukherier as these lines were secured. The railhead was being <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> as rapidly as possible, but did not reach Deir Suneid until 28 November. So it was a considerable distance over which the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps worked to bring up supplies.|$|E
5|$|The NK 2nd Division <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> {{in spite}} of the casualties, and that {{afternoon}} elements of it were flanking the 27th Infantry's main position. Michaelis issued an order about 22:00 for another withdrawal to high ground near Hwanggan. The withdrawal started near midnight with heavy fighting still in progress on the right flank. Murch took control of all nine US tanks and put them on line facing north, where they attacked North Korean troops approaching on the road. Mortar fire fell along the battalion line and the road behind it. F Company and the nine tanks covered the 2nd Battalion withdrawal.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{producers}} David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, based on the original work of George R. R. Martin. As the second season covers mostly A Clash of Kings, the second book of the series, the first episode adapts the material from the first chapters of the book including the Prologue, Sansa I, Tyrion I, Bran I, Catelyn I, Davos I, {{the first half of}} Daenerys I and Jon III (chapters 1, 3–5, 7, 10, 12, and 23). Two chapters {{from the beginning of the}} book had already been included in season 1's finale, while Jon Snow's story is being <b>pushed</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} had outrun {{the supporting}} artillery {{and the initial}} force of more than 500 tanks that played {{a large role in}} the Allied success was reduced to six tanks fit for battle within four days. The Germans on Chipilly Spur commanded a wide field of fire to the south of the Somme, and their flanking fire held up the left units of the Australian Corps until late on 9 August, when a small Australian party slipped across the river and captured the village of Chipilly itself, together with a renewed attack by III Corps. On the Canadian front, congested roads and communication problems prevented the British 32nd Division being <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> rapidly enough to maintain the momentum of the advance.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} {{had been}} too great for the advance posts of the much-reduced Yeomanry Mounted Division, which fell back down the Wadi Zeit but the pursuing Ottoman force was suddenly blocked by the 11th Light Horse Regiment of 4th Light Horse Brigade. The 4th Light Horse Brigade had moved by the same route as the 7th Mounted Brigade, but near El Burj they found the road blocked by fire. Brigadier General Grant, reporting to Barrow, ordered the brigade south of Beit Ur el Tahta to support the 6th Mounted Brigade. The 11th Light Horse Regiment was <b>pushed</b> <b>forward</b> with two machine guns to hold Wadi Zeit south west of Beit Ur el Foqa.|$|E
