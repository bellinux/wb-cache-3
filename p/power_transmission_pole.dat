40|$|Monitoring {{vegetation}} encroachment under overhead {{high voltage}} power line is a challenging problem for electricity distribution companies. Absence of proper monitoring could result in damage to the power lines and consequently cause blackout. This will affect electric power supply to industries, businesses, and daily life. Therefore, to avoid the blackouts, it is mandatory to monitor the vegetation/trees near <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> lines. Unfortunately, the existing approaches are more time consuming and expensive. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach to monitor the vegetation/trees near or under the <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>poles</b> using satellite stereo images, which were acquired using Pleiades satellites. The 3 D depth of vegetation has been measured near <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> lines using stereo algorithms. The area of interest scanned by Pleiades satellite sensors is 100 square kilometer. Our dataset covers <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>poles</b> in a state called Sabah in East Malaysia, encompassing a total of 52 poles {{in the area of}} 100 km. We have compared the results of Pleiades satellite stereo images using dynamic programming and Graph-Cut algorithms, consequently comparing satellites’ imaging sensors and Depth-estimation Algorithms.

40|$|The main aims of {{this study}} were to examine the wood {{substrate}} degrading capacities of microorganisms isolated from soft-rotted CCA-treated Eucalyptus sp. <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>poles</b> in ground contact, and to evaluate techniques for assessment of the degree of wood degradation caused by microbial attack. The performances of various wood preservatives, including remedial and ground-line maintenance treatment systems for poles, were assessed. The predominant organism isolated from Tasmanian woods in this study, the Hyphomycete Phialophora mutabiIis, had demonstrable celIuIase, hemicelIulase, amylase and pectic enzyme activities as well as a measurable wood-degrading capacity. Trichoderma viride was a highly cellulolytic fungus in pure culture, and a dominant early coloniser of untreated E. obIiqua wood in ground contact. However, it produced minimal wood degradation in this examination. A small (< 10 4 cel I s/g wood sawdust) bacterial microflora was found in untreated and preservative-treated hardwoods. Bacterial isolates possessed a number of wood-degrading enzymes: A strain of Bacillus megaterium (S 9 NC) isolated in this study, showed cel I ulase, xy I anase, amylase and pectic enzyme activities, whilst CelIulomonas sp. 8 N produced at least one celIuIase, xyIanase, pectic enzyme and Iaccase. However, no definite degradation of intact E. obIiqua sapwood cell walls by pure cultures of bacteria was observed by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Fungi (including Basidiomycetes) and bacteria were earl y colonizers of untreated E. obliqua stakes in the ground. A mutual istic relationship, albeit not a close one, was demonstrated between propagule counts of fungi and bacteria, isolated from CCA-treated Eucalyptus sp. sawdusts. Two techniques for estimating microbial activity in wood samples were developed in this study, and compared with other methods for estimating the degree of wood degradation. The methods were: i. a Cx-celIuIase assay i i. a modified and improved chitin assay for estimation of fungal biomass in wood. Appropriate parameters for both assay methods were determined. The Cx-celIuIase and chi tin assays were relatively quick and sensitive methods for assessing the degree of microbial attack of woods. These assay procedures, plus impaction determinations using the Pilodyne(R) instrument, and to a much lesser extent the fungal propaguIe count, were largely objective procedures. Visual and microscopic estimates of wood degradation were found to be highly subjective in this study. Several field trials of wood preservatives were used to compare the newly developed assay methods with fungal propagule counts, Pilodyne(R) impaction determinations, and visual and microscopic estimates of wood degradation. The trial s examined were remedial treatments of <b>transmission</b> <b>poles</b> at Warrane, Tasmania, and bandage treatments of poles at Grafton, N. S. W. and Coff 's Harbour, N. S. W. In addition, an E. obliqua preservative-treated sapwood stake trial was emplaced at Grove, Tasmania.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the dynamic {{behavior}} of tapered composite poles with circular hollow cross-section and flexible connections, which are designed for use in <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> lines. These <b>poles,</b> made from polyester reinforced with E-glass fibers, are produced using the filament winding technique. <b>Transmission</b> <b>poles</b> are mainly subjected to cantilever bending, since loading due to the wires and wind gusts is applied laterally. In the present work, a simple, but reliable, tapered beam element is developed and the dynamic behavior of the poles is accurately captured using only a few elements. A simple model for flexible connections is established and incorporated in the analysis. The material is orthotropic and its behavior is assumed linearly elastic. Shear effects are accounted for in the analysis because of their significant role due to the low shear modulus. Modal analysis is performed for design purposes to obtain the natural frequency and period of poles with various geometrical characteristics and material lay-up, {{as well as the}} effect of connection flexibility. Experimental results on the dynamic behavior of jointed composite poles are also presented and the effect of damping is estimated. The analytical results presented in this work are based on typical composite poles produced by filament winding, and are compared to commercially available finite element codes.

40|$|Spotted gum {{dominant}} forests occur from Cooktown {{in northern}} Queensland (Qld) to Orbost in Victoria (Boland et al. 2006) and these forests are commercially very important with spotted gum {{the most commonly}} harvested hardwood timber in Qld {{and one of the}} most important in New South Wales (NSW). Spotted gum has a wide range of end uses from solid wood products through to <b>power</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>poles</b> and generally has excellent sawing and timber qualities (Hopewell 2004). The private native forest resource in southern Qld and northern NSW is a critical component of the hardwood timber industry (Anon 2005, Timber Qld 2006) and currently half or more of the native forest timber resource harvested in northern NSW and Qld is sourced from private land. However, in many cases productivity on private lands is well below what could be achieved with appropriate silvicultural management. This project provides silvicultural management tools to assist extension staff, land owners and managers in the south east Qld and north eastern NSW regions. The intent was that this would lead to improvement of the productivity of the private estate through implementation of appropriate management. The other intention of this project was to implement a number of silvicultural experiments and demonstration sites to provide data on growth rates of managed and unmanaged forests so that landholders can make informed decisions on the future management of their forests. To assist forest managers and improve the ability to predict forest productivity in the private resource, the project has developed: • A set of spotted gum specific silvicultural guidelines for timber production on private land that cover both silvicultural treatment and harvesting. The guidelines were developed for extension officers and property owners. • A simple decision support tool, referred to as the spotted gum productivity assessment tool (SPAT), that allows an estimation of: 1. Tree growth productivity on specific sites. Estimation is based on the analysis of site and growth data collected from a large number of yield and experimental plots on Crown land across a wide range of spotted gum forest types. Growth algorithms were developed using tree growth and site data and the algorithms were used to formulate basic economic predictors. 2. Pasture development under a range of tree stockings and the expected livestock carrying capacity at nominated tree stockings for a particular area. 3. Above-ground tree biomass and carbon stored in trees. •A series of experiments in spotted gum forests on private lands across the study area to quantify growth and to provide measures of the effect of silvicultural thinning and different agro-forestry regimes. The adoption and use of these tools by farm forestry extension officers and private land holders in both field operations and in training exercises will, over time, improve the commercial management of spotted gum forests for both timber and grazing. Future measurement of the experimental sites at ages five, 10 and 15 years will provide longer term data on the effects of various stocking rates and thinning regimes and facilitate modification and improvement of these silvicultural prescriptions. ...|$|R

Australia has a vast land mass covered by overhead powerlines to meet the energy needs of a population that is located at geographically dispersed places over the country.

Bush fires can have catastrophic consequences such as loss of property, injury and death of people, {{in addition to a}} loss of forests which causes adverse impact on the environment and wild life. In 2009, Victorian bush fires in Australia killed 173 people, injured over 414 people, damaged 450, 000 hectares of forest and vegetation and destroyed over 3, 500 buildings and structures.
