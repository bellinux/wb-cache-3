50|$|<b>Pirbuterol</b> (trade name Maxair) is a short-acting β2 {{adrenoreceptor}} agonist with bronchodilating action used in {{the treatment}} of asthma, available (as <b>pirbuterol</b> acetate) as a breath-activated metered-dose inhaler (Maxair Autohaler).|$|E
50|$|After {{inhalation}} of doses up to 800 μg (twice {{the maximum}} recommended dose) systemic {{blood levels of}} <b>pirbuterol</b> are below the limit of assay sensitivity (2-5 ng/ml). A mean of 51% of the dose is recovered in urine as <b>pirbuterol</b> plus its sulfate conjugate following administration by aerosol. <b>Pirbuterol</b> is not metabolized by catechol-O-methyltransferase. The plasma half-life measured after oral administration is about two hours.|$|E

50|$|Like <b>pirbuterol,</b> {{procaterol}} exhibits similar broncholytic properties as salbutamol (albuterol), {{but it has}} {{somewhat of}} a more prolonged action. It is recommended for use as an inhaled drug for treating asthma.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pirbuterol</b> {{is used in}} asthma for {{reversal}} of acute bronchospasm, and also as a maintenance medication to prevent future attacks. It {{should be used in}} patients 12 years of age and older with or without concurrent theophylline and/or inhaled corticosteroid.|$|E
40|$|Fifty-nine {{patients}} with severe chronic heart failure were given <b>pirbuterol,</b> a beta agonist with vasodilator and positive inotropic properties. The acute haemodynamic responses to both single (20 patients) and incremental doses (39 patients) were measured. <b>Pirbuterol</b> increased cardiac index and reduced left ventricular filling pressure and systemic vascular resistance with only {{small changes in}} heart rate and blood pressure. Maximal effects were observed {{at an average of}} 170 minutes after a single oral dose of <b>pirbuterol.</b> In the incremental dose studies the plasma <b>pirbuterol</b> concentration was found to increase with increasing doses and was related to the magnitude of the haemodynamic response. <b>Pirbuterol</b> was well tolerated, and no drug-related side effects were recorded. Oral <b>pirbuterol</b> clearly improved pump performance in these patients, the haemodynamic changes being consistent with vasodilatation as the dominant mechanism rather than a direct inotropic effect...|$|E
40|$|The acute haemodynamic {{effects of}} oral <b>pirbuterol</b> (a beta-agonist) were contrasted {{with those of}} sodium nitroprusside, a vasodilator, in six {{patients}} with hypoxic chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Sodium nitroprusside (1 - 5 mg/kg intravenously) reduced mean pulmonary arterial pressure and total pulmonary vascular resistance significantly (p less than 0. 01) without change in cardiac output or right ventricular ejection fraction, measured by radionuclide ventriculography. Oral <b>pirbuterol</b> (22. 5 mg) produced a greater reduction in total pulmonary vascular resistance than sodium nitroprusside, {{largely as a result}} of increasing cardiac output. Right ventricular ejection fraction also increased significantly after <b>pirbuterol</b> (p less than 0. 01). <b>Pirbuterol</b> in a lower dosage (15 mg by mouth) in six further patients with hypoxic chronic bronchitis and emphysema produced similar changes in total pulmonary vascular resistance and right ventricular ejection fraction. Nine of the patients who were studied acutely thereafter received <b>pirbuterol</b> 15 mg thrice daily for six weeks, which produced a significant fall in systolic pulmonary arterial pressure and a rise in right ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0. 01), without a significant fall in arterial oxygen tension. <b>Pirbuterol</b> acts as a vasodilator on the pulmonary circulation in these patients and may in addition improve right ventricular performance by an inotropic action...|$|E
40|$|A randomised, within patient {{comparison}} {{was made}} in patients with severe chronic heart failure, to study the acute haemodynamic effects of oral agents which have inotropic and vasodilator properties. A non-glycosidic non-adrenergic positive inotropic agent with vasodilator properties (amrinone) was compared with a beta-agonist which has vasodilator and positive inotropic effects (<b>pirbuterol).</b> To assess whether combined treatment with a venodilator might be advantageous, {{the effect of adding}} isosorbide dinitrate was studied. Oral amrinone or <b>pirbuterol</b> were given in random order to each of 13 patients, on successive days, and oral isosorbide dinitrate was added after two-and-a-half hours. Control values before amrinone or <b>pirbuterol</b> were similar, and both drugs increased cardiac index while reducing left ventricular filling pressure, right atrial pressure, and systemic vascular resistance. Heart rate and blood pressure were unchanged. The magnitude of the changes caused by amrinone and <b>pirbuterol</b> were not significantly different. The addition of isosorbide dinitrate caused further falls in left ventricular filling pressure and right atrial pressures, and a fall in heart rate with each drug. Other measurements remained unchanged. Although amrinone and <b>pirbuterol</b> have different pharmacological properties, their acute haemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure are indistinguishable...|$|E
40|$|Two {{proposed}} {{methods are}} {{reported for the}} quantitation of <b>pirbuterol</b> hydrochloride, namely, (i) colorimetric and (ii) titrimetric methods. The colorimetric method is based on coupling betweem diazotized sulphanilamide and <b>pirbuterol</b> hydrochloride. Under the optimum conditions studied, the coupling product exhibits a maximum at 440 nm. Linear relation between absorbance, A, and concentration of <b>pirbuterol</b> hydrochloride is in the range 5 - 40 μgml- 1. The mean percentage obtained for capsules (ExirelR - 15 mg) was 100. 8 ± 0. 7 whereas mean percentage recovery obtained for the authentic drug was 100. 5 ± 0. 8. The titrimetric procedure involves bromination of authentic <b>pirbuterol</b> in acid medium and residual titration of excess bromine. The stoichiometry of the reaction was investigated and infra-red analysis, of the bromoderivative was carried out. When applied to capsules the bromometric method gave mean percentage of 100. 18 ± 2. 25...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the oral beta agonist <b>pirbuterol</b> on {{pulmonary}} haemodynamics and gas exchange were studied in nine patients with severe irreversible airflow obstruction and moderate arterial hypoxaemia. After administration of 15 mg <b>pirbuterol</b> pulmonary vascular resistance fell by 19 % but cardiac output rose by 24 %, so that pulmonary arterial pressure showed no significant change. Systemic arterial oxygen pressure fell by 7 %, limiting the rise in oxygen delivery to 21 %. All changes were significant at the 2 % level. These results show that <b>pirbuterol</b> dilates the pulmonary bed {{at the cost of}} a slight worsening of gas exchange, which is compensated by an independent rise in blood flow...|$|E
40|$|The metabolic, {{hormonal}} and haemodynamic {{effects of}} oral <b>pirbuterol,</b> a new beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, were studied acutely (n = 19) and after 3 months treatment (n = 11) {{in patients with}} severe heart failure receiving chronic frusemide therapy. In the acute study fasted patients (n = 10) showed reductions in plasma K+ (P less than 0. 005) and cortisol (P less than 0. 01) and increases in plasma glucose (P less than 0. 005), insulin (P less than 0. 01), lactate (P less than 0. 005) and pyruvate (P less than 0. 0025). These acute changes were less in unfasted subjects (n = 9). Maximal increase in stroke volume occurred at approximately half the plasma <b>pirbuterol</b> concentration required for maximal effect on plasma insulin. Treatment with <b>pirbuterol</b> for 3 months was associated with sustained increases in stroke volume and fasting plasma glucose and insulin, but there was loss of all other acute metabolic effects. Despite concurrent frusemide and digoxin therapy acute hypokalaemia caused no adverse effects. Hypokalaemia did not occur with chronic <b>pirbuterol</b> administration...|$|E
40|$|In many {{patients}} with chronic bronchitis and emphysema right and left ventricular ejection fractions (RVEF and LVEF) are reduced. A study was conducted using multiple gated equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography to compare the effects of oral salbutamol 4 mg and <b>pirbuterol</b> 15 mg on cardiac function in 12 {{patients with chronic}} bronchitis (forced expiratory volume in one second 0. 86 (SEM 0. 12) 1; arterial oxygen pressure 8. 2 (SEM 0. 5) kPa (61. 7 (SEM 3. 8) mm Hg)). Different doses of nebulised salbutamol (500 microgram and 5 mg) were also compared in nine of the patients. Both oral salbutamol and oral <b>pirbuterol</b> produced significant increases in RVEF and LVEF at 60 and 90 minutes after drug ingestion (p less than 0. 01 in each case). There {{were no significant differences}} between salbutamol and <b>pirbuterol</b> in their effects on RVEF and LVEF. Inhaled salbutamol at doses commonly prescribed had no significant effect on RVEF and LVEF after 20 and 60 minutes. Salbutamol and <b>pirbuterol</b> given by mouth have similar actions on RVEF and LVEF. Further studies are necessary to assess the effects of long term B 2 agonists in this group of patients...|$|E

40|$|An open {{study of}} long term {{treatment}} with an oral beta 2 agonist (<b>pirbuterol</b> 20 mg three times daily) was undertaken in 63 patients with severe chronic heart failure. During {{three months of}} treatment 20 (32 %) patients died, of whom 16 were taking the drug {{at the time of}} death. Mortality was related to initial functional class (New York Heart Association classification: 23 % in grade III and 75 % in grade IV). Concomitant treatment with digoxin did not affect mortality. The drug was well tolerated by most patients but unwanted side effects necessitated withdrawal of the drug in six (10 %). Thirty-five patients were continuing to take the drug after three months, of whom 22 reported symptomatic improvement and only four deterioration. There was a relation between symptomatic improvement and increase in exercise capacity. At initial haemodynamic assessment a single dose of <b>pirbuterol</b> increased the cardiac index by 34 % and the stroke index by 21 %. Left ventricular filling pressure fell by 23 % and systemic vascular resistance by 22 %. Haemodynamic reassessment after three months of continuous treatment in 29 patients showed maintained improvement in the group as a whole, although individual variation was considerable. There was no apparent relation between haemodynamic improvement and improvement in exercise duration and symptoms. Severe heart failure has a poor prognosis. Identification of those patients who may derive benefit from treatment with a particular drug is not yet possible...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} various positive inotropic drugs (except the cardiac glycosides) and to attempt a classification according to their mechanism of action. The most important drugs with established positive inotropic effect are summarizedfirst. Present interest focuses on the development of new agents with sufficiently high oral bioavailability and long duration of action. Prenalterol is a betax-adrenergic drug which appears to fulfil these criteria. Of increasing importance are drugs which combine a positive inotropic and a vasodilator effect. These include mainly the methylxanthines and possibly also the beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulating agents salbutamol, terbutaline, fenoterol and <b>pirbuterol.</b> A positive inotropic and vasodilator effect is also produced by the new compounds amrinone and AR-L 115 BS. These drugs appear to resemble theophylline and other methylxanthines in that they also act mainly as phosphodiesterase inhibitors with a subsequent increase in cAMP without interference with alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors. The mechanism of the as yet only experimentally established positive inotropic effect of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulating agents, e. g. phenylephrine, is unknown. However, it is independent of the cAMP system and is not accompanied by changes in frequency. For the long-term management of congestive myocardial failure the cardiac glycosides are still the most important agents. Their exact mechanism o...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjective: To {{address the}} utility of the forced {{oscillation}} technique (FOT) in assessing bronchodilator responsiveness compared with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1). Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive 126 patients with a clinical history of asthma without any other lung diseases at a pulmonary function testing laboratory. The following measurements were obtained three times each, before and after two doses of <b>pirbuterol</b> 0. 2 mg inhalation: the respiratory resistance at 5 Hz (Rrs 5), the mean respiratory resistance between 5 and 20 Hz (Rrs 5 – 20), and the mean respiratory conductance (Grs 5 – 20) by FOT and the FEV 1 by spirometer. These measurements were transformed into dimensionless subject-specific effect-size “d-scores” by dividing them by the estimated pooled within-subject standard deviation. Results: Descriptive statistics for each value were the following [mean baseline value (±sd), Δ value (pre- minus post value), and d-score (P value compared to FEV 1) ]: Grs 5 – 20 (Ls− 1 kPa− 1) [1. 79 ± 0. 53, Δ=+ 0. 39, d= 2. 64 (P 0. 05]. Conclusions: Several forced oscillation measures, namely Grs 5 – 20, Rrs 5 – 20 and Rrs 5, are more accurate and sensitive for detecting bronchodilator response than FEV 1 in patients with asthma...|$|E
40|$|Receptor {{tyrosine}} kinases such as ErbB 2 contribute {{greatly to}} human malignant transformation, but {{the role that}} other receptors such as ß 2 adrenergic receptor (B 2 AR) play in cancer is ill defined. Furthermore, while some GTPases such as Ras and RhoA promote oncogenesis, RhoB has been suggested to have tumor suppressive activity. In this thesis the tumor suppressive activity of ß 2 adrenergic receptors through blockade of the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk pathway is demonstrated. Furthermore, this thesis provides strong {{evidence in support of}} a tumor suppressive activity of RhoB, but not RhoA, in delaying EbB 2 mammary oncogenesis in a transgenic mouse model. Chapter 1 describes a chemical biology approach that identifies a beta 2 adrenergic receptor agonist, ARA- 211 (also known as <b>pirbuterol)</b> that suppresses the growth of cultured cells and of human tumors grown in nude mice by a mechanism involving stimulation of the ß 2 AR, cAMP production and activation of PKA, which in turn leads to the inactivation of C-Raf, Mek 1 / 2 and Erk 1 / 2. Chapter 2 describes the translation of these findings by ex-vivo treatment of fresh human tumor biopsies, with the ultimate goal of validating this novel therapeutic approach. Chapter 3 describes the generation of transgenic mice that over express ErbB 2 along with either RhoB or RhoA {{to determine the effects of}} these two small GTPases on ErbB 2 -mediated mammary tumorigenesis. The findings indicate that overexpression of RhoB, but not RhoA, results in decreased multiplicity and delay in the tumor onset mediated by ErbB 2 overexpression. In summary, this thesis work resulted in the discovery of how crosstalk between the ß 2 AR/cAMP/PKA circuit with the Raf/Mek/Erk 1 / 2 cascade leads to tumor suppression; and the discovery of the suppression of ErbB 2 -mediated breast cancer by the GTPase RhoB...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{adrenoceptor}} agonists and antagonists {{have been}} used to analyse the effects of stimulation of individual types of adrenoceptor {{in various parts of the}} rabbit heart. The selective alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonists used were St 587 and BHT 933 respectively, and the antagonists were prazosin (alpha 1) and WY 25309 (alpha 2). The selective beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists were atenolol and ICI 118551, respectively. <b>Pirbuterol</b> was a highly selective beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist. The non-selective agonists noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline were also employed with various combinations of antagonists. Phenylephrine was found to stimulate beta- as well as alpha-adrenoceptors. Rimiterol was a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, partially selective for beta 2 -adrenoceptors. In the sinus node beta 1 -, but not beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation increased the fast phase of depolarization (Vmax). Both beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation increased the slope of slow diastolic depolarization, accelerated repolarization and increased maximum diastolic potential. After blockade of both beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptors alpha 1 -adrenoceptor stimulation caused bradycardia, due exclusively to delayed repolarization. alpha 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation had no effect. In Purkinje cells and papillary muscle both beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation accelerated repolarization. Stimulation of alpha 2 -adrenoceptors had no effect. Beta 1 -, not beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation augmented peak contractions 3 - 5 -fold, and greatly increased rate of development of tension. After beta-blockade alpha 1 -adrenoceptor stimulation moderately increased peak contractions (up to 47 %), but increased time-to-peak and duration of contractions. These patterns of adrenoceptor-mediated effects were unchanged in animals pre-treated with sufficient 6 -hydroxydopamine to eliminate responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation. The results would be consistent with beta 1 -, and beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation increasing inward calcium current, and with stimulation of alpha 1 -adrenoceptors delaying its inactivation, rather than increasing its magnitude...|$|E
