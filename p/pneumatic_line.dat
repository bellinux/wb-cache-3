50|$|Modern rocket-based {{systems are}} a common choice for vessels that require a line-throwing {{apparatus}} to meet SOLAS requirements, but in the late 1980s, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>line</b> throwers were invented and are preferred in many instances. Shoulder-fired line-throwing guns are available, {{and there are also}} slingshot-based systems.|$|E
50|$|The Rescue Rocket was {{replaced}} by other <b>pneumatic</b> <b>line</b> throwers in 1989. There are several interchangeable projectile types which provide for differing deployment distances and the launchers can be supplied with almost any type of rope. The range of payloads {{are not limited to}} rope, systems can also be equipped with ladders.|$|E

25|$|The {{fleet of}} CLRV and ALRV {{experienced}} operational issues during extreme cold temperatures in early 2015 as doors and brakes failed as {{moisture in the}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>lines</b> froze. Moisture also caused track sanders to fail. Buses were used to replace streetcars unfit for service, some of which had failed while in service. The new Flexity cars which use electronic braking and door operations were unaffected by the weather.|$|R
50|$|The {{fleet of}} CLRV and ALRV has {{experienced}} operational issues during extreme cold temperatures in early 2015 as doors and brakes fail as {{moisture in the}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>lines</b> freezes. As a result, the TTC will often substitute buses during extreme cold conditions to prevent cars from blocking roads or getting into accidents when brakes fail to deploy. The problem is being resolved with the new Flexity cars which use electronic braking and door operations.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} a number of more {{unconventional}} applications. These include using a modified <b>pneumatic</b> <b>line</b> thrower as an air gun to tag or attach transmitters to whales. This technique {{has been used in}} several studies: bowhead whales off West Greenland, minke whales off northern Norway, and a collision study of humpback whales off Panama.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>line</b> throwers {{on the market}} and {{depending}} on the exact technology; they deliver a line different distances. One of the original line throwing devices was the Rescue Rocket. Made of fabric and aluminum parts, this line thrower was a bit clumsy to operate, had relatively short delivery distances, and was specifically used for water rescue.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, the LEGO <b>pneumatic</b> <b>line</b> was revamped, {{and a new}} {{cylinder}} {{and pump}} piece were introduced. The old cylinders and pumps were discontinued. The chief {{difference is that the}} new cylinder had two input valves now, which allowed both pushing and pulling without needing complex circuits involving the distribution block piece. The Generation 2 cylinders also had metal rods so that they more closely resembled real hydraulic cylinders.|$|E

The obtained rational approximation can be used in variable time step simulators to evaluate the influence of the line on fluid servosystems dynamics. In this work the application of a numerical approximation technique (Vector Fitting) is proposed, with particular attention to physical causality, stability and passivity of the model. This approach is applied to the study of pressure transients in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>lines.</b> Simulation results are compared with results furnished by Pichè and Ellman's variational method and with experimental data obtained on test bench, showing a good agreemen...|$|R

50|$|Hybrid {{connectors}} have housings with inserts {{that allow}} the intermixing of many connector types, such as those mentioned above. These housings may also allow intermixing of electrical and non-electrical interfaces, examples of the latter being <b>pneumatic</b> <b>line</b> connectors, and optical fiber connectors. Because hybrid connectors are modular in nature, they tend to simplify assembly, repair, and future modifications. They also allow the creation of composite cable assemblies that can reduce equipment installation time by {{reducing the number of}} individual cable and connector assemblies.|$|E
50|$|The system {{consists}} of a specially designed launch pad with lightning rods and conductors attached. The launch pad is either controlled wirelessly or via <b>pneumatic</b> <b>line</b> to the control station to prevent the discharge traveling to the control equipment. The fine copper wire (more recently reinforced with kevlar) {{is attached to the}} ground and plays out from the rocket as it ascends. The initial strike follows this wire and is as a result unusually straight. As the wire is vaporized by the initial strike subsequent strikes are more angular in nature following the ionization trail of the initial strike. Rockets of this type are used for both lightning research and lightning control.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969, Ken Kreuter {{established}} Kreuter Manufacturing Company {{to manufacture}} pneumatic HVAC controls. [...] In 1970, the company moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba because of business incentives. In 1974, the company moved to Minnesota, and, in 1978, the company moved manufacturing operations to its present location in New Paris, Indiana. In 1989, {{the research and}} development side of the business (then known as Kreuter Engineering) made the transition from Minnesota to Indiana as well in order to consolidate all company operations. In 1995, Kreuter Manufacturing Company, Inc. began doing business as KMC Controls, Inc., a name change that better reflected its business. Over the decades, analog electronic and then DDC (Direct Digital Control) products were added to the original <b>pneumatic</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

50|$|Mechanical {{conveying}} {{lines are}} equipped with spark detectors preferentially at material transfer points, e.g. at drop shafts. Due to the loosened product flow, the sparks or the hot spots are extinguished immediately, as in {{is the case in}} <b>pneumatic</b> conveying <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Straight-line sander: A sander that vibrates in a {{straight}} line, instead of in circles. Good for places where hand sanding is tedious or [...] "blocking" [...] is required. Most are air-powered, a few electric. The first <b>pneumatic</b> straight <b>line</b> sander was patented by Otto Hendrickson in 1969.|$|R
50|$|The {{alongside}} connected replenishment (CONREP) is {{a standard}} method of transferring liquids such as fuel and fresh water, along with ammunition and break bulk goods. The supplying ship holds a steady course and speed, generally between 12 and 16 knots. Moving at speed lessens relative motion due to wave action and allows better control of heading. The receiving ship then comes alongside the supplier {{at a distance of}} approximately 30 yards. A gunline, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>line</b> thrower, or shot line is fired from the supplier, which is used to pull across a messenger line. This line is used to pull across other equipment such as a distance line, phone line, and the transfer rig lines. As the command ship of the replenishment operation, the supply ship provides all lines and equipment needed for the transfer. Additionally, all commands are directed from the supply ship.|$|E
40|$|Trains brakes are {{pneumatically}} actuated and use {{the same}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>line</b> for power and signal transmission. This simple architecture presents limits for long trains since the last vehicles brakes receive a very delayed command and the train speed must be limited. Solutions were proposed using a signal transmission line parallel to the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>line.</b> These systems, though effective, present drawbacks and are of difficult implementation as retrofits. A solution is described, which leaves the braking system unchanged, but reduces the time delay in the signal transmission by adding a pneumotronic unit at the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>line</b> end. This unit analyzes the pressure time history, recognizes the precursors of new braking commands and issues inputs to a valve at the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>line</b> end mirroring the commands to the master valve. The rapidity of the braking action is enhanced, thereby allowing a more uniform braking and a speed increase of long freight trains...|$|E
50|$|The <b>pneumatic</b> {{conveying}} <b>line</b> {{is equipped}} with spark detectors to detect sparks and hot or glowing particles. The detected ignition sources are extinguished at lightning speed by an automatically activated extinguishing device - mostly without production interruption. The reaction time only amounts to approx. 100 - 300 milliseconds.|$|R
5000|$|Researchers have {{attempted}} to overcome the difficulties of robotic components in MRI {{in a variety of}} ways; some have placed controls and other magnetic sensitive units outside the shielded room of the MRI.

50|$|Air suspension, as standard, {{gives the}} driver {{the option of}} three ride height {{settings}} including a standard ride height of 172 mm, an off-road height of 227 mm and a lowered access mode. There is also an extra height available which is accessed by holding the respective button for when the off-road ride height is not enough. When the vehicle bellies out, its control system will sense weight being lessened on the air springs and the ride height is automatically raised to the suspensions greatest articulation. The cross-link aspect of the suspension system, which debuted on the L322 Range Rover in 2002, results in better off-road performance by electronically operating valves in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>lines</b> which link adjacent air springs. In {{the event of a}} wheel on one side being raised when travelling off-road, the pneumatic valves are opened and the adjacent wheel is forced down, simulating the action of a live axle setup.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{particularly}} as trains became longer and faster, and railroad lines grew more congested, the banjo signal was considered to have a single and terminal flaw: visibility. The internal disc was difficult to see in foggy weather and when snow clung to the glass panel. Earlier types of electro-pneumatic semaphores made by US&S had seen some limited application by 1880 as automatic block signals. The need to maintain air pressure in the long <b>pneumatic</b> <b>lines</b> eventually led the railroads to discontinue their widespread use as automatic block signals. However, these types did see long service in interlocking plants. Early semaphores also had limited range with manual wire operation and poor reliability in bad weather. Thus some railroads continued to use disc signals where automatic block signal operation was needed between manual block stations as borne out by period rule books well into the 1920s and beyond.|$|R
5000|$|The {{control system}} {{included}} a pneumatic {{system and a}} solid-state electrical sequence controller packaged with spark exciters for the gas generator and the thrust chamber spark plugs, plus interconnecting electrical cabling and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>lines,</b> {{in addition to the}} flight instrumentation system. The pneumatic system consisted of a high-pressure helium gas storage tank, a regulator to reduce the pressure to a usable level, and electrical solenoid control valves to direct the central gas to the various pneumatically controlled valves. The electrical sequence controller was a completely self-contained, solid-state system, requiring only DC power and start and stop command signals. Pre-start status of all critical engine control functions was monitored in order to provide an “engine ready" [...] signal. Upon obtaining “engine ready” and “start” signals, solenoid control valves were energized in a precisely timed sequence to bring the engine through ignition, transition, and into main-stage operation. After shutdown, the system automatically reset for a subsequent restart.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper aims {{with the}} {{mathematical}} modelling {{of an active}} inflatable device. This device is composed of a compressor, an Electro-pneumatic Pressure Converter (EPC) and an Inflatable Textile fabric Pocket (ITP). The later has interesting mechanical properties and is fabricated using Jacquard knitting technique which allows automatic production of unlimited varieties of pattern weaving without any mould. Thanks to these features, these ITPs have provided a better alternative to the classical airbags made by stretchable polymer material. The proposed mathematical model is obtained by combining sub-models of two main parts of the whole system. In this way, a generalised and flexible model is obtained which can easily {{take into consideration the}} ITPs of different shapes. The pressure dynamics inside the ITP are considered by taking into account the air flow rate, variation of the volume of ITP and the length of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>lines</b> joining ITP with compressed air source. The parameters of the whole mathematical model are obtained via identification techniques. The effectiveness of the model is assessed through several experimental tests {{with the help of a}} servo hydraulic fatigue testing machine...|$|R

50|$|Rotary airlock feeders {{are very}} often {{installed}} to dose material in a <b>pneumatic</b> conveying <b>line.</b> As a consequence, {{a lot of}} gas coming from the conveying line is brought upstream by {{the rotation of the}} valve and the leakages in between the rotor and the stator. In order to have a functional system and a good flow of material, a small hopper equipped with a filter is very often connected to the feeder. The air can then be vented and the product admitted to the valve.|$|R
