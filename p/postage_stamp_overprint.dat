50|$|Japanese forces overran Sarawak in February 1942. Initially, {{revenues}} from the 1918 issues were handstamped in Japanese, but these were quickly replaced with <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> <b>overprinted</b> in various Japanese characters. These were used until Sarawak was liberated by Australian forces in 1945. After the war, <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> were used for fiscal purposes.

50|$|The first {{revenue stamp}} issued in the Straits Settlements was an East India <b>postage</b> <b>stamp</b> <b>overprinted</b> S.S. in a diamond. Only about 20 copies {{are known to}} exist of this stamp, making it very rare. On 1 April 1867, the Settlements became a British Crown Colony and so Indian {{revenues}} were issued overprinted with a crown and a new value in cents. In 1874 a new issue portraying Queen Victoria, and this remained in use until the 1880s with minor changes in the perforation.|$|R

25|$|Malta {{first issued}} revenue stamps in 1899, when {{the island was}} a British colony. From that year to 1912, all revenue issues were <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> <b>overprinted</b> accordingly, with the {{overprinting}} being done either locally or by De La Rue in London. <b>Postage</b> <b>stamps</b> also became valid for fiscal use from 1912–13, so no new revenues were issued until 1925–30, when a series of key type stamps depicting King George V were issued. These exist unappropriated for use as general-duty revenues, or with additional inscriptions indicating a specific use (Applications, Contracts, Registers or Stocks & Shares). The only other revenues after this series were £1 stamps issued in 1941, 1948 and 1954. <b>Postage</b> <b>stamps</b> remained valid for fiscal use until at least the 1970s.|$|R

50|$|Largest of the princely states {{located in}} Central India, Gwalior signed a postal {{convention}} on 1 Jul 1885. It possessed an efficient postal system with its headquarters {{at the capital}} city of Lashkar (present day Gwalior city) on the same principles as the Imperial British Indian Post Office. Like all convention states, Gwalior used British India <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> <b>overprinted</b> at first at the Government of India Central Printing Press, Calcutta till 1926 and later at the Security Press in Nashik. Like the stamps of the other states, Gwalior's stamp issues have a rich collection of errors and varieties. Gwalior was also unusual in that its overprinting consisted of the word 'Gwalior' alone and the suffix 'state', as used in all other convention states, was never used.|$|R
50|$|Jamaica issued many stamps for {{judicial}} purposes. The first issue consisited of Queen Victoria <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> <b>overprinted</b> {{with a large}} JUDICIAL in bold sans-serif capitals in 1898. This set was reissued with a different watermark in 1908. Similar issues followed in the following years, with the portrait being changed to that of King George V (1913), King George VI (1938) and Queen Elizabeth II (1953). In some cases, the stamps were from specially printed sheets which were never issued without the overprint. These include all of the stamps bearing the portraits of King George VI or Queen Elizabeth II. In 1969 the Queen Elizabeth II set was reissued denominated in decimal currency, and these remained in use until the 1970s.|$|R

50|$|Trengganu {{initially}} used dual-purpose <b>postage</b> {{and revenue}} <b>stamps</b> for fiscal purposes, and like some other states it had high values solely intended for revenue use. During the Japanese occupation, various <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> were <b>overprinted</b> in Japanese restricting them to fiscal use. When the Japanese gave Trengganu to Thailand {{a set of}} stamps showing a sailing boat was issued in 1944. In 1950 a set of three stamps showing a traditional fishing boat were issued.|$|R

50|$|The first Trinidad {{revenue was}} issued in 1887 and {{consisted}} of a 1d <b>postage</b> <b>stamp</b> of 1883 <b>overprinted</b> FEE. Other values were prepared but none were issued, since later that year a new set with values from ½d to 5s was issued. A year later 10s and £1 values were added to this series (by surcharging 5s <b>stamps).</b> In 1890 <b>postage</b> due <b>stamps</b> were <b>overprinted</b> FEE as well, but these are extremely rare. The 1s and 5s values of the 1887 Fee set also exist further overprinted FREE for use as Free Fee <b>stamps.</b> In 1890 <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> with the same face values were overprinted FREE FEE at once and replaced the 1887 issue. Trinidad also issued a customs stamp to pay the duty on opium in the 1880s.|$|R
50|$|In most countries, {{the cost}} of sending a {{telegram}} was paid using normal <b>postage</b> <b>stamps.</b> These can often be identified by their distinctive telegraphic cancels or punched holes. In some countries and at some times, special telegraph stamps were produced or <b>postage</b> or revenue <b>stamps</b> <b>overprinted</b> to pay the fee (e.g. Nicaragua, Ecuador). Private companies also issued telegraph stamps in countries where the telegraph network was in private ownership.|$|R
2500|$|In 1899, {{the local}} <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> were <b>overprinted</b> [...] "Guam" [...] {{as was done}} for the other former Spanish colonies, but this was {{discontinued}} shortly thereafter and regular U.S. <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> have been used ever since. Because Guam {{is also part of}} the U.S. Postal System (postal abbreviation: GU, ZIP code range: 96910–96932), mail to Guam from the U.S. mainland is considered domestic and no additional charges are required. Private shipping companies, such as FedEx, UPS, and DHL, however, have no obligation to do so, and do not regard Guam as domestic.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, a 15c Queen Elizabeth II <b>postage</b> <b>stamp</b> was <b>overprinted</b> <b>STAMP</b> DUTY. This was {{followed}} by a new set a year later with ten values from 10c to $20. During Elizabeth's reign, the numeral design of 1908 was again reissued with different sizes, watermarks and papers. The last issue of Hong Kong revenues was in 1980, when a set of thirteen values from $3 to $1200 was issued. These are common and readily available. Two surcharges on this issue were made around 1990.|$|R
50|$|The first revenue stamps of Barbados {{were issued}} in 1916. The first issue {{consisted}} of contemporary King George V <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> <b>overprinted</b> Revenue, {{and some were}} also surcharged. This was followed by similar issues overprinted REVENUE, REVENUE ONLY or Revenue Only. Later in 1916, British embossed revenues were issued overprinted for Barbados. These issues (with several differences in design and watermark) continued to be used until 1934, and values from 3d to £100 were issued. From 1950 to 1972 embossed revenues denominated in decimal currency and with the country name incorporated in the design (instead of overprinted) were issued, with values from $4.80 to $480. These were replaced by a numeral design in 1977 which had high values from $25 to $500. From 1979 to 1985 a new design with the coat of arms {{of the country was}} issued with values up to $1000. This issue was reprinted in 1999 with the new imprint date {{at the bottom of the}} stamp.|$|R
50|$|In 1901, ZAR <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> were <b>overprinted</b> E.R.I. PASS {{and a new}} {{value to}} pay for the fee for {{passports}} of native workers.

50|$|Northern Rhodesia {{became a}} {{separate}} protectorate in 1924, and it issued its first revenue stamps {{a year later}} with values from £2 to £50. These portrayed King George V and showed a local scene with giraffes, elephants and other wildlife. These continued to be used until the 1950s. <b>Postage</b> <b>stamps</b> were used for revenue transactions of lower values. In 1953, Queen Elizabeth II <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> were <b>overprinted</b> with a large R indicating revenue use. About two years later, the 1925 King George V design was reissued with the portrait of the Queen, this time with values ranging from 1d to £50.|$|R
