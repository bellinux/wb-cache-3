The British poured reinforcements into the country, and it was in this phase of the campaign, lasting several years that the most difficult and arduous work fell to the lot of the troops. The resistance was finally broken by meting out collective punishments on villages. Villages were burned and the property of villagers either confiscated or destroyed. The British policy of overwhelming reprisals against villages suspected of assisting the insurgency eventually brought the country under control. British colonialism was triumphant.|$|E

Method: Study subjects comprised a total of 88 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients from Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders (BIRDEM) and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU). Of them 63 patients on MHD and 25 predialysis patients served as cases and controls respectively. Clinical history was taken and serological markers for HBV (HBsAg, Anti-HBs, and Anti-HBc) were determined by using ELISA. Results: Hepatitis B virus was positive in 1. 6 % of maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and in 16 % of controls (p 10 IU/L) was found in 57 %. None of the controls were vaccinated but 66 % had <b>protective</b> titer indicating <b>post</b> exposure natural immunity. Conclusions: Hepatitis B virus positivity was significantly higher among the predialysis subjects compared to dialysis group...|$|R
40|$|MEMS Viscosity sensors {{are widely}} used in {{different}} applications nowadays. MEMS sensors are created by making them small in size almost penny-like sized. With low power consumption, cheap costs of production, and mass production of the devices. These sensors are able to measure viscosity through three different characteristics, the frequency, amplitude and the quality factor. Each of these describes the fluids viscosity, by using a vibrational type viscometer. The sensor has been proven to work in conductive fluids after a post process fabrication of a protective layer of Parylene C. The sensors performance has been altered due to a thicker membrane, but still operates as expected. The MEMS viscosity sensor has been tested in various glycerol water mixtures to simulate conductive fluids with varying viscosity. The tests had positive outcomes, and the sensors performance was not altered, they worked as predicted. Different tests were accomplished {{to make sure the}} sensors performance remained close to normal operations after adding the protective layer of Parylene C. Four distinct oils were chosen to accomplish this variation test. Oil was chosen rather than a conductive liquid in order to prevent the sensor from damaging itself, and having to repackage another sensor and running all the previous tests. With these tests the sensor proved that adding a thin layer of Parylene C does not alter the sensors performance, but it does tend to change some of the theoretical calculations because there are various factors involving the addition of a <b>protective</b> layer <b>post</b> fabrication. In this case a layer of 0. 5 micro meters of Parylene C is thick enough to protect against conductive fluid. Overall the addition of the protective layer shielded the sensor from conductive fluids and prevented the electrical currents to expand through the conductive fluid...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Postnatal {{depression}} (PND) {{is a vital}} {{public health}} problem affecting maternal and ‎child health. The prevalence of postnatal depression varies between 3. 5 % and 40 %. Postnatal ‎depression normally occurs within 6 – 8 weeks after childbirth. This study examined the ‎etiological role of risk factors recognized to be relevant to the onset of postpartum depression ‎and poverty in developed societies faced by women. ‎Objectives: The first objective {{was to determine the}} prevalence of postnatal depression in ‎mothers of Karachi. The second objective was to determine the risk factors associated with ‎postnatal depression in mothers of Karachi. ‎Method: This was a cross sectional study, data was collected from three different districts of ‎Karachi from December 2010 till April 2011. The study population was selected by a cluster ‎sampling method. Using probability cluster sampling 150 women were selected from each cluster ‎for the study population of 700 women. A total of 450 women were selected for participation in ‎the study. All women who gave their written consent and were more than 30 weeks pregnant ‎were included. Women, who were transient visitors and had missing data, were excluded. ‎General Health Questionnaire, a 12 item measure was used for psychological health. Cronbach’s ‎alpha was 0. 71. At 6 – 8 weeks after birth, the mothers were administered Edinburgh Postnatal ‎Depression Scale. Cronbach’s Alpha of Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale 0. 80. Postnatal ‎depression was determined from binary logistic regression analysis of antenatal and early ‎postnatal variables. ‎Result: Among antenatal factors mothers who had current score of five or more on twelve item ‎General Health Questionnaire had a prevalence of 48. 6 % of postnatal depression(252 / 519; ‎p= 0. 037) These mothers were 1. 52 times (95 % CI, 1. 026 - 2. 263) at the risk of postnatal ‎depression. <b>Protective</b> factors against <b>post</b> natal depression include planned pregnancy, (relative ‎risk= 0. 63, CI: 0. 431 - 0. 946) help from family members, (relative risk= 0. 62, 95 % CI: 0. 418 - 0. 918) ‎and help from husband (relative risk= 0. 54, 95 % CI: 0. 369 - 0. 817). Among postnatal factors, ‎mothers who had cesarean delivery had a prevalence of 48. 4 % of postnatal depression (251 / 519; ‎p-value= 0. 025. These mothers were 1. 57 times (95 % CI, 1. 057 - 2. 33) at the risk of postnatal ‎depression. ‎Conclusion: Postnatal depression is a common mental illness in our local population; it is usually ‎a consequence of preexisting antenatal morbidity and is a chronic disorder for one half of the ‎women who suffer from this illness. Key message: Cognitive behavioral therapy and ‎antidepressants help for postnatal depression. ...|$|R
