Significant, long-range, corre-lations in the whole field are found at an optimal time lag of one month. The correlation function for significantly-correlated well pairs, after normalization for the distribution of available wells, shows a long-range power-law decay that is consistent with a critical-point response at the reser-voir scale.

40|$|Joint funding by the Department of Energy and the State of Texas has Permitted a three year, multi-disciplinary {{investigation}} to enhance oil recovery from a dual porosity, fractured, low matrix permeability oil reservoir to be initiated. The Austin Chalk <b>producing</b> <b>horizon</b> trending thru the median of Texas {{has been identified}} as the candidate for analysis. Ultimate primary recovery of oil from the Austin Chalk is very low because of two major technological problems. The commercial oil producing rate is based on the wellbore encountering a significant number of natural fractures. The prediction of the location and frequency of natural fractures at any particular region in the subsurface is problematical at this time, unless extensive and expensive seismic work is conducted. A major portion of the oil remains in the low permeability matrix blocks after depletion because there are no methods currently available to the industry to mobilize this bypassed oil.

40|$|A {{combination}} of a regenerating biochemical mixture and an organic surfactant {{has been applied to}} wells in the East Texas Field with the goal of restoring permeability, reversing formation damage, mobilizing hydrocarbons, and ultimately increasing production. Initial work in task 1 was designed to open the perforations and remove blockages of scale, asphaltene, and other corrosion debris. This was accomplished on three wells that produce from the Woodbine, and was necessary to prepare the wells for more substantial future treatments. Secondly, in task 2, two wells were treated with much larger quantities of the biochemical mixture, e. g. 25 gallons, with a 2 % KCl carrier solution that carried the active biochemical solution into the near wellbore area adjacent to producing reservoir. After a 7 to 10 day acclamation and reaction period, the wells were put back into production. The biochemical solution successfully broke down the scale, paraffin and other binders blocking permeability and released significant debris, which was immediately produced into the flow lines and separators. Oil production was clearly improved and the removed debris was a maintenance issue until the surface equipment could be modified. In task 3 the permeability restrictions in a cylindrical area of 10 to 20 feet from the wellbore within the reservoir were treated with the biochemical solution. Fluid was forced into the <b>producing</b> <b>horizon</b> using the hydraulic head of the well filled with 2 % KCl solution, allowed to acclimate, and then withdrawn by pumping.

Twenty (3 D) seismic lines and ten wells have been analyzed. The results of this study indicated that, the main reservoir in this concession is Hawaz Formation. Hawaz has been split into 8 units with a subdivision of Hawaz H 4 into three subunits with the objective of better characterization of the three general fine upward intervals. The lower interval of H 4 zone presents the better reservoir properties. The depth of reflector H 4 ranges from 4100 ft in the northwestern part of the study area and increases to 4600 ft in the southeastern part of the study area. In this study, the outline of the Hawaz paleohighs which is NC- 186 Field “J” is generally trending in the NW-SE direction. The well logging analysis particularly quick look interpretation indicates that Hawaz Formation in the studied wells is mainly oil-bearing with some water-bearing sand levels at the horizons from H 4 to and H 6 which are potentially the main reservoirs. The water bearing zones are beyond these horizons starting from the sub-horizon H 6 c and the oil water contact is probably at depth 4495 ft. The crossplot of porosity-saturation for H 5 and H 6 b indicates firmly that these horizons are indeed at irreducible state and will produce mainly oil as indicated in J 4 -NC 186 well, while the crossplot of H 8 shows wide scattering of points which is the main characteristic for water <b>producing</b> <b>horizon.</b> The depth of Hawaz Formation H 4 is more than 4160 ft in J 4, J 12 and J 16 wells in the northwestern parts of this field and increases to 4400 in {{the central part of the}} concession at well J 1...|$|E
40|$|Oil and gas {{have been}} commercially {{produced}} in Illinois for over 100 years. Existing commercial production is {{from more than}} fifty-two named pay horizons in Paleozoic rocks {{ranging in age from}} Middle Ordovician to Pennsylvanian. Over 3. 2 billion barrels of oil have been produced. Recent calculations indicate that remaining mobile resources in the Illinois Basin may be on the order of several billion barrels. Thus, large quantities of oil, potentially recoverable using current technology, remain in Illinois oil fields despite a century of development. Many opportunities for increased production may have been missed due to complex development histories, multiple stacked pays, and commingled production which makes thorough exploitation of pays and the application of secondary or improved/enhanced recovery strategies difficult. Access to data, and the techniques required to evaluate and manage large amounts of diverse data are major barriers to increased production of critical reserves in the Illinois Basin. These constraints are being alleviated by the development of a database access system using a Geographic Information System (GIS) approach for evaluation and identification of underdeveloped pays. The Illinois State Geological Survey has developed a methodology that is being used by industry to identify underdeveloped areas (UDAs) in and around petroleum reservoirs in Illinois using a GIS approach. This project utilizes a statewide oil and gas Oracle{reg_sign} database to develop a series of Oil and Gas Base Maps with well location symbols that are color-coded by <b>producing</b> <b>horizon.</b> Producing horizons are displayed as layers and can be selected as separate or combined layers that can be turned on and off. Map views can be customized to serve individual needs and page size maps can be printed. A core analysis database with over 168, 000 entries has been compiled and assimilated into the ISGS Enterprise Oracle database. Maps of wells with core data have been generated. Data from over 1, 700 Illinois waterflood units and waterflood areas have been entered into an Access{reg_sign} database. The waterflood area data has also been assimilated into the ISGS Oracle database for mapping and dissemination on the ArcIMS website. Formation depths for the Beech Creek Limestone, Ste. Genevieve Limestone and New Albany Shale in all of the oil producing region of Illinois have been calculated and entered into a digital database.

40|$|The {{shift of}} {{hydrocarbon}} {{exploration and production}} to deepwater has resulted in new opportunities for the petroleum industry(in this project, the deepwater depth greater than 1, 000 ft) but also, it has introduced new challenges. In 2001,more than 999 Bcf of associated gas were produced from the Gulf of Mexico, with deepwater associated gas production accounting for 20 % of this produced gas. Two important issues are the potential environmental impacts and the economic value of deepwater associated gas. This project was designed to test the viability of storing associated gas in a saline sandstone aquifer above the <b>producing</b> <b>horizon.</b> Saline aquifer storage would have the dual benefits of gas emissions reduction and gas storage for future use. To assess the viability of saline aquifer storage, a simulation {{study was conducted with}} a hypothetical sandstone aquifer in an anticlinal trap. Five years of injection were simulated followed by five years of production (stored gas recovery). Particular attention was given to the role of relative permeability hysteresis in determining trapped gas saturation, as it tends to control the efficiency of the storage process. Various cases were run to observe the effect of location of the injection/production well and formation dip angle. This study was made to: (1) conduct a simulation study to investigate the effects of reservoir and well parameters on gas storage performance; (2) assess the drainage and imbibition processes in aquifer gas storage; (3) evaluate methods used to determine relative permeability and gas residual saturation; and (4) gain experience with, and confidence in, the hysteresis option in IMEX Simulator for determining the trapped gas saturation. The simulation results show that well location and dip angle have important effects on gas storage performance. In the test cases, the case with a higher dip angle favors gas trapping, and the best recovery is the top of the anticlinal structure. More than half of the stored gas is lost due to trapped gas saturations and high water saturation with corresponding low gas relative permeability. During the production (recovery) phase, it can be expected that water-gas production ratios will be high. The economic limit of the stored gas recovery will be greatly affected by producing water-gas ratio, especially for deep aquifers. The result indicates that it is technically feasible to recover gas injected into a saline aquifer, provided the aquifer exhibits the appropriate dip angle, size and permeability, and residual or trapped gas saturation is also important. The technical approach used in this study may be used to assess saline aquifer storage in other deepwater regions, and it may provide a preliminary framework for studies of the economic viability of deepwater saline aquifer gas storage...|$|E
