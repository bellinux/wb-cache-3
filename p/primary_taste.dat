However, when responses to individual taste stimuli were analyzed, sucrose was the only stimulus that produced significant changes in activation (in the orbitofrontal cortex and thalamus). The results suggest that changes in BOLD activation during the present task may have reflected the demands of identifying the taste stimulus rather than perceptual responses to oral receipt of the individual taste stimuli. ...|$|R

The insula and frontal operculum (<b>primary</b> <b>taste</b> area) are also involved in reward processing. The aim was to compare human gustatory evoked potentials (GEP) recorded in the primary and secondary gustatory cortices in a fasted state with those after food intake. Fifteen healthy volunteers were enrolled in this observational study. In each of two sessions, two GEP recordings were performed (at 11 : 00 am and 1 : 30 pm) in response to sucrose gustatory stimulation, and a sucrose-gustatory threshold was determined. During one session, a standard lunch was provided between the two GEP recordings. During the other session, subjects had nothing to eat. Hunger sensation, wanting, liking and the perception of the solution’s intensity were evaluated with visual analogue scales. GEP latencies measured in the Pz (p< 0. 001), Cz (p< 0. 01), Fz (p< 0. 001) recordings (<b>primary</b> <b>taste</b> area) were longer after lunch than in the pre-prandial condition.

40|$|Poster Discussion - D 1 : P- 87 INTRODUCTION: There {{have been}} {{controversial}} issue that how we perceive taste {{in the brain}} cortex. Recent developments in {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) have provided the possibility to study this system in vivo, and by this technique, insular cortex {{have been shown to be}} activated by taste. But there have been few studies to compare the topography of activities elicited by different taste stimuli. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to investigate whether there are neural representations of perceiving each basic taste solutions in the human <b>primary</b> <b>taste</b> cortex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to conduct this experiment precisely, we developed an original taste solution delivery system. Healthy volunteers (ten males and ten females, 19 - 29 yrs of age) participated in this study, and all images were acquired with a 3. 0 -T MRI. Umami (0. 1 M Monosodium L-glutamate and 0. 005 M inosine monophosphate), salty (0. 1 M sodium chloride) and sweet (0. 5 M sucrose) were used as taste solutions and tasteless artificial saliva (using the main ionic components of saliva; 25 mM KCl plus 2. 5 mM NaHCO 3) as the control. The Human Experimentation Committee of Kyushu University approved all experimental procedures. RESULTS: The areas activated by all taste solutions were located on the putative human <b>primary</b> <b>taste</b> cortex (FWE-corrected P < 0. 05). The all activated areas showed some different representation with overlapping each other.

2500|$|As {{in most of}} France, {{viticulture}} {{is believed}} to have been introduced into Aquitania by the Romans. The earliest evidence of sweet wine production, however, dates only to the 17th century. While the English were Bordeaux's main consumer since the Middle Ages, their <b>primary</b> <b>tastes</b> were for red claret. It was the Dutch traders of the 17th century who first developed an interest in white wine. For years they were active in the trade of German wines but production in Germany began to wane in the 17th century as the popularity of beer increased. The Dutch saw an opportunity for a new production source in Bordeaux and began investing in the planting of white grape varieties. They introduced to the region German white wine making techniques, such as halting fermentation with the use of sulphur in order to maintain residual sugar levels. One of these techniques involved taking a candle (known as a [...] "brimstone candle") with its wick dipped in the sulphur and burned in the barrel that the wine will be fermenting in. This would leave a presence of sulphur in the barrel that the wine would slowly interact with as it was fermenting. Being an anti-microbial agent, sulphur stuns the yeast that stimulates fermentation, eventually bringing it to a halt with high levels of sugars still in the wine. The Dutch began to identify areas that could produce grapes well suited for white wine production and soon homed in on the area of Sauternes. The wine produced from this area was known as vins liquoreux but it is not clear if the Dutch were actively using nobly rotted grapes at this point.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Right insular cortex is {{involved}} in taste discrimination, but its functional organization is still poorly known. In general, sensory cortices represent the spatial prevalence of relevant features for each sensory modality (visual, auditory, somatosensory) in an ordered way across the cortical space. Following this analogy, we hypothesized that <b>primary</b> <b>taste</b> cortex is organized in similar ordered way in response to six tastes with known receptorial mechanisms (sweet, bitter, sour, salt, umami, CO 2). DESIGN: Ten normal subjects were enrolled in a pilot study. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), a high resolution cortical registration method, and specialized procedures of feature prevalence localization, to map fMRI responses within the right insular cortex, to water solutions of quinine hydrochloride (bitter), Acesulfamate K (sweet), sodium chloride (salt), mono potassium glutamate + inosine 5 ' mono phosphate (Umami), citric acid (sour) and carbonated water (CO 2). During an fMRI scan delivery of the solutions was applied in pseudo-random order interleaved with cleaning water. RESULTS: Two subjects were discarded due to excessive head movements. In the remaining subjects, statistically significant activations were detected in the fMRI responses to all tastes in the right insular cortex (p< 0. 05, family-wise corrected for multiple comparisons). Cortical representation of taste prevalence highlighted two spatially segregated clusters, processing two and three tastes coupled together (sweet-bitter and salt-umami-sour), with CO 2 in between. CONCLUSIONS: Cortical representation of taste prevalence within the right <b>primary</b> <b>taste</b> cortex appears to follow the ecological purpose of enhancing the discrimination between safe nutrients and harmful substances...|$|E
25|$|The {{tongue is}} a muscular organ {{in the mouth}} of most {{vertebrates}} that manipulates food for mastication, and is used in the act of swallowing. It is of importance in the digestive system and is the <b>primary</b> organ of <b>taste</b> in the gustatory system. The tongue's upper surface (dorsum) is covered by taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae. It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva, and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels. The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth. A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals.|$|R
40|$|In the tongue, {{distinct}} {{classes of}} taste receptor cells detect the five basic tastes, sweet, sour, bitter, sodium salt, and umami 1, 2. Among these qualities, bitter and sour stimuli are innately aversive, whereas sweet and umami are appetitive, and generally attractive to animals. In contrast, salty taste {{is unique in}} that increasing salt concentration fundamentally transforms an innately appetitive stimulus into a powerfully aversive one 3 – 7. This appetitive-aversive balance helps maintain appropriate salt consumption 3, 4, 6, 8, and represents {{an important part of}} fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. We have previously shown that the appetitive responses to NaCl are mediated by taste receptor cells expressing the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC 8, while the cellular substrate for salt aversion was unknown. Here we explore the cellular and molecular basis for the rejection of high concentrations of salts (> 300 mM NaCl or KCl). We now show that high-salt recruits the two <b>primary</b> aversive <b>taste</b> pathways by activating the sour and bitter taste-sensing cells. We also demonstrate that genetic silencing of these pathways abolishes behavioral aversion to concentrated salt, without impairing salt attraction. Notably, mice devoid of salt-aversion pathways now exhibit unimpeded, continuous attraction even to exceedingly high concentration...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{ambulatory}} {{peritoneal dialysis}} (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD) have different meta bolic effects in dialysis patients, since absorption of intraperitoneal glucose implies an additional energy source in CAPD patients. In spite of this, protein-energy malnutrition {{is known to}} occur frequently, both in patients on hemodialysis and in patients on CAPD, and an association with increased morbidity and mortality is well established. It is therefore of great importance to identify factors which have the potential of negatively influencing the nutritional state. In this thesis, it is demonstrated that <b>taste</b> acuity of <b>primary</b> <b>tastes</b> in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is hampered {{in the form of}} increased recognition thresholds. The taste thresholds were significantly higher for salt and bitter in preuremic patients, compared to control subjects. In CAPDpatients, taste recognition of bitter was impaired and in HD patients, recognition of salty taste was impaired. Patients with ESRD have significantly fewer fungiform taste buds, which might be an important factor contributing to the impaired taste acuity. In addition {{to the study of the}} number of taste buds, the presence of peripheral nervous tissue in taste buds with the aid of specific markers (primary antibodies) was also analysed. With these antibodies, no major immunohistochemical differences were disclosed between uremic patients and healthy controls. In a study of energy intake in CAPD patients (five days food recording), it is also established that dietary energy intake from carbohydrates, protein and fat is lower in patients treated with CAPD than in those treated with hemodialysis, although the energy percentage composition of the dietary macronutrients is unaffected. Transperitoneal energy intake compensates for this lower dietary energy intake, and makes total energy intake almost the same in CAPD and HD patients, but with a change in the composition of the diet of CAPD patients towards a significantly higher carbohy drate percentage in energy intake. The level of total energy intake observed places both patient groups in the risk zone for developing malnutrition. CAPD patients have a slower gastric emptying rate, as measured with scintigraphy. This impair ment of gastric emptying rate correlates with disturbances in the normal myoelectric rhythm of the stomach (tachygastria), as measured with electrogastrography. A body composition analysis of CAPD patients, as studied with computed tomography of the abdomen and of the right thigh, as well as with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, reveals an increase in the intraabdominal fat area after commencement of peritoneal dialysis. Thus CAPD induces a dis tribution of body fat that resembles the pattern observed in the metabolic syndrome. In conlusion, several factors which have the potential of negatively influencing the nutritional state in CAPD patients have been identified. Moreover, a metabolic consequence in the form of an increase in intraabdominal fat is demonstrated in patients treated with CAPD, which may acceler ate the development of risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
