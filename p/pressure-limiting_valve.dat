40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} manual resuscitators (MRs) used in Brazil in accordance with international standards. Methods: Using a respiratory system simulator, four volunteer physiotherapists employed eight MRs (five produced in Brazil and three produced abroad), which were tested for inspiratory and expiratory resistance of the patient valve; functioning of the pressure-limiting valve; and tidal volume (VT) generated when the one-handed and two-handed techniques were used. The tests were performed and analyzed {{in accordance with the}} American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F 920 - 93 criteria. Results: Expiratory resistance was greater than 6 cmH 2 O. L − 1. s− 1 in only one MR. The <b>pressure-limiting</b> <b>valve,</b> a feature of five of the MRs, opened at low pressures (< 17 cmH 2 O), and the maximal pressure was 32. 0 - 55. 9 cmH 2 O. Mean VT varied greatly among the MRs tested. The mean VT values generated with the one-handed technique were lower than the 600 mL recommended by the ASTM. In the situations studied, mean VT was generally lower from the Brazilian-made MRs that had a <b>pressure-limiting</b> <b>valve.</b> Conclusions: The resistances imposed by the patient valve met the ASTM criteria in {{all but one of the}} MRs tested. The pressure-limiting valves of the Brazilian-made MRs usually opened at low pressures, providing lower VT values in the situations studied, especially when the one-handed technique was used, suggesting that both hands should be used and that the <b>pressure-limiting</b> <b>valve</b> should be closed whenever possible...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We have {{recently}} shown that intraoperative bacterial transmission to patient IV stopcock sets {{is associated with}} increased patient mortality. In this study, we hypothesized that bacterial contamination of anesthesia provider hands before patient contact is {{a risk factor for}} direct intraoperative bacterial transmission. METHODS: Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center is a tertiary care and level 1 trauma center with 400 inpatient beds and 28 operating suites. The first and second operative cases in each of 92 operating rooms were randomly selected for analysis. Eighty-two paired samples were analyzed. Ten pairs of cases were excluded because of broken or missing sampling protocol and lost samples. We identified cases of intraoperative bacterial transmission to the patient IV stopcock set and the anesthesia environment (adjustable <b>pressure-limiting</b> <b>valve</b> and agent dial) in each operating room pair by using a previously validated protocol. We then used biotype analysis to compare these transmitted organisms to those organisms isolated from the hands of anesthesia providers obtained before the start of each case. Provider-origin transmission was defined as potential pathogens isolated in the patient stopcock set or environment that had an identical biotype to the same organism isolated from hands of providers. We also assessed the efficacy of the current intraopera...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Enterococci, {{the second}} {{leading cause of}} health care-associated infections, have evolved from {{commensal}} and harmless organisms to multidrug-resistant bacteria associated with {{a significant increase in}} patient morbidity and mortality. Prevention of ongoing spread of this organism within and between hospitals is important. In this study, we characterized Enterococcus transmission dynamics for bacterial reservoirs commonly encountered by anesthesia providers during the routine administration of general anesthesia. METHODS: Enterococcus isolates previously obtained from bacterial reservoirs frequently encountered by anesthesiologists (patient nasopharynx and axilla, anesthesia provider hands, and the adjustable <b>pressure-limiting</b> <b>valve</b> and agent dial of the anesthesia machine) at 3 major academic medical centers were identified as possible intraoperative bacterial transmission events by class of pathogen, temporal association, and phenotypic analysis (analytical profile indexing). They were then subjected to antibiotic disk diffusion sensitivity for transmission event confirmation. Isolates involved in confirmed transmission events were further analyzed to characterize the frequency, mode, origin, location of transmission events, and antibiotic susceptibility of transmitted pathogens. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-nine anesthesia reservoir isolates were previously identified by gross morphology and simple rapid tests as Enterococcus. The combination of further analytical profile indexing analysis and temporal association implicated 43 % (166 / 389) of those isolates in possible intraoperative bacterial transmission events. Approximately, 30 % (49 / 166) of possible transmission events were confirmed by additional antibiotic disk diffusion analysis. Two phenotypes, E 5 and E 7, explained 80 % (39 / 49) of confirmed transmission events. For both phenotypes, provider hands were a common reservoir of origin proximal to the transmission event (96 % [72 / 75] hand origin for E 7 and 89 % [50 / 56] hand origin for E 5) and site of transmission (94 % [16 / 17] hand transmission location for E 7 and 86 % [19 / 22] hand transmission location for E 5). CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesia provider hand contamination is a common proximal source and transmission location for Enterococcus transmission events in the anesthesia work area. Future work should evaluate the impact of intraoperative hand hygiene improvement strategies on the dynamics of intraoperative Enterococcus transmission...|$|E
40|$|The Combibag self-inflating {{resuscitator}} incorporates {{an adult}} and a paediatric segment {{as well as a}} two-stage <b>pressure-limiting</b> safety <b>valve.</b> The resuscitator is not without problems. A sizeable forward leak of gas can occur beyond the patient valve. The patient valve design is such that a spontaneously breathing patient draws his inspired gas entirely from room air. Problems can also occur with the valve either sticking or being blown forward off its seating, thereby making the resuscitator inoperable and dangerous. The use of a two-stage <b>pressure-limiting</b> safety <b>valve</b> should prevent unnecessary barotrauma but could well lead to unrecognised venting with inadequate ventilation when used by inexperienced personnel...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{industrial}} revolution, automation {{has proven to}} be a vital component in the growth of any major industry. For positron emission tomography (PET), automation provides efficient, reproducible, and safe methods for routinely producing PET imaging agents, or tracers, using short lived radioisotopes. Over the years, many automated radiosynthesizers have been developed to automate the required production steps up through preparation of the tracer for intravenous injection into the patient or subject, both for clinical and preclinical applications. However, many commercial radiosynthesizers have temperature, pressure, and reagent compatibility limitations, which have required synthetic radiochemists to tailor and optimize synthesis protocols to fit within the constraints of a particular automated radiosynthesizer. Furthermore, the fluidic pathways on these systems generally need to be reconfigured for each tracer one wishes to make. To overcome these limitations, our group has developed a novel, three-reactor, automated radiosynthesizer (ELIXYS) based on the principle of dynamic fluid paths, which is achieved by actuating the reactors to different positions and pneumatically sealing them against a chemically inert gasket. The mechanism enables compatibility with high pressures and obviates the need for large numbers of <b>pressure-limiting</b> <b>valves</b> and fittings. Coupled with a chemist-friendly user interface, it also enables users to quickly automate known radiosyntheses and develop new protocols without requiring specific hardware modifications for each tracer. In this dissertation, I present the design, characterization, validation, and implementation of the system and discuss the capabilities, limitations, and overall work I performed with the system in automating 18 F-labeled PET tracer radiosyntheses. I also include the translation of several known tracers onto the system, automation of tracers not previously automated, as well as characterization data helpful for others to more efficiently utilize this and other automated radiosynthesizers. Overall, radiosyntheses of 18 F-labeled PET tracers performed on the ELIXYS resulted in similar or improved radiochemical yields and synthesis times compared to both automated and manual radiosyntheses, without the need for any hardware reconfiguration to make different tracers...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} gently {{ventilate}} a patient's lungs using a self-inflating bag requires a properly working adjustable <b>pressure-limiting</b> (APL) <b>valve.</b> We compared {{the performance of}} the APL valves of the GE Aisys CS(2) and the Draeger Fabius anaesthetic machines during closure and opening from 1 - 20 and from 20 - 1 cmH 2 O, using standardised experimental baby and adolescent patient lung models. Airway pressures and inspiratory tidal volumes were measured using an ASL- 5000 test lung and a GE Aisys CS(2) near-patient spirometry sensors. In both lung models, the GE Aisys CS(2) APL valves demonstrated non-linear behaviours for airway pressures and for inspiratory tidal volumes, with a sharp increase at set APL pressure levels of 8 - 10  cmH 2 O. With further closure of the GE Aisys CS(2) APL valves up to 20  cmH 2 O, inspiratory tidal volumes decreased to ~ 50 % of the highest values measured. Airway pressures in the Draeger Fabius APL valves demonstrated a near linear increase and decrease. Airway pressure values measured in the Draeger Fabius were never higher than those set by the APL valves, whereas in the GE Aisys CS(2), they considerably exceeded set pressures (by up to 27  cmH 2 O). We conclude that {{the performance of the}} GE Aisys CS(2) APL valve does not allow safe bag-assisted ventilation of a patient's lungs...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Gram-negative {{organisms are}} a major health care concern with {{increasing}} prevalence of infection and community spread. Our primary aim was to characterize the transmission dynamics of frequently encountered gram-negative bacteria in the anesthesia work area environment (AWE). Our secondary aim was to examine links between these transmission events and 30 -day postoperative health care-associated infections (HCAIs). METHODS: Gram-negative isolates obtained from the AWE (patient nasopharynx and axilla, anesthesia provider hands, and the adjustable <b>pressure-limiting</b> <b>valve</b> and agent dial of the anesthesia machine) at 3 major academic medical centers were identified as possible intraoperative bacterial transmission events by class of pathogen, temporal association, and phenotypic analysis (analytical profile indexing). The top 5 frequently encountered genera were subjected to antibiotic disk diffusion sensitivity to identify epidemiologically related transmission events. Complete multivariable logistic regression analysis and binomial tests of proportion were then {{used to examine the}} relative contributions of reservoirs of origin and within- and between-case modes of transmission, respectively, to epidemiologically related transmission events. Analyses were conducted with and without the inclusion of duplicate transmission events of the same genera occurring in a given study unit (first and second case of the day in each operating room observed) to examine the potential effect of statistical dependency. Transmitted isolates were compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to disease-causing bacteria for 30 -day postoperative HCAIs. RESULTS: The top 5 frequently encountered gram-negative genera included Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Brevundimonas, Enterobacter, and Moraxella that together accounted for 81 % (767 / 945) of possible transmission events. For all isolates, 22 % (167 / 767) of possible transmission events were identified by antibiotic susceptibility patterns as epidemiologically related and underwent further study of transmission dynamics. There were 20 duplicates involving within- and between-case transmission events. Thus, approximately 19 % (147 / 767) of isolates excluding duplicates were considered epidemiologically related. Contaminated provider hand reservoirs were less likely (all isolates, odds ratio 0. 12, 95 % confidence interval 0. 03 - 0. 50, P = 0. 004; without duplicate events, odds ratio 0. 05, 95 % confidence interval 0. 01 - 0. 49, P = 0. 010) than contaminated patient or environmental sites to serve as the reservoir of origin for epidemiologically related transmission events. Within- and between-case modes of gram-negative bacilli transmission occurred at similar rates (all isolates, 7 % between-case, 5. 2 % within-case, binomial P value 0. 176; without duplicates, 6. 3 % between-case, 3. 7 % within-case, binomial P value 0. 036). Overall, 4. 0 % (23 / 548) of patients suffered from HCAIs and had an intraoperative exposure to gram-negative isolates. In 8. 0 % (2 / 23) of those patients, gram-negative bacteria were linked by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to the causative organism of infection. Patient and provider hands were identified as the reservoirs of origin and the environment confirmed as a vehicle for between-case transmission events linked to HCAIs. CONCLUSIONS: Between- and within-case AWE gram-negative bacterial transmission occurs frequently and is linked by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to 30 -day postoperative infections. Provider hands are less likely than contaminated environmental or patient skin surfaces to serve as the reservoir of origin for transmission events...|$|E
