25|$|As {{part of its}} {{outreach}} {{to address the needs}} of the software community, DACS provides a technical inquiry service, wherein it provides up to four hours of research, free of charge, to address any technical inquiry from any member of the DACS community. In some cases, DACS connects the inquirer directly with a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to satisfy the request. DTIC, the organization that funds the DACS, regards the number of technical inquiries handled by DACS each month as a key <b>performance</b> <b>metric</b> for operation of the IAC. The scope of questions asked is very broad, ranging from simple questions asking for a definition of an acronym, to very complex questions. The following list contains some recent requests that convey the essence and scope of this service.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by {{the work}} of Tukey, Gunther {{explored}} ways to help systems analyst visualize performance {{in a manner similar to}} that already available in scientific visualization and information visualization. In 1991, he developed a tool called Barry, which employs barycentric coordinates to visualize sampled CPU usage data on large-scale multiprocessor systems. More recently, he has applied the same 2-simplex barycentric coordinates to visualizing the Apdex application <b>performance</b> <b>metric,</b> which is based on categorical response time data. A barycentric 3-simplex] (a tetrahedron), that can be swivelled on the computer screen using a mouse, has been found useful for visualizing packet network performance data.

2500|$|The {{extension}} of ROC curves for classification problems {{with more than}} two classes has always been cumbersome, as the degrees of freedom increase quadratically {{with the number of}} classes, and the ROC space has [...] dimensions, where [...] is the number of classes. Some approaches have been made for the particular case with three classes (three-way ROC). The calculation of the volume under the ROC surface (VUS) has been analyzed and studied as a <b>performance</b> <b>metric</b> for multi-class problems. However, because of the complexity of approximating the true VUS, some other approaches [...] based on an {{extension of}} AUC are more popular as an evaluation metric.|$|E
