5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the <b>pain</b> <b>as</b> it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's <b>pain</b> <b>as</b> best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E

5|$|Although later medieval traditions {{described}} <b>Pain</b> <b>as</b> a chamberlain to King Henry, {{that position}} is not securely confirmed in contemporary records. He did hold other offices, however, {{including that of}} sheriff in two counties near the border between England and Wales. In his capacity as a royal justice, Pain also heard legal cases for the king throughout much of western England.|$|E

5|$|Workers who {{experience}} acute low back <b>pain</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of}} a work injury may be asked by their employers to have x-rays. As in other cases, testing is not indicated unless red flags are present. An employer's concern about legal liability is not a medical indication and should not be used to justify medical testing when it is not indicated. There should be no legal reason for encouraging people to have tests which a health care provider determines are not indicated.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a stroke}} {{at a family}} reunion in Tallahassee, Florida, in September 1989, Roddenberry's health {{declined}} further, ultimately requiring him to use a wheelchair. Following another stroke in early October 1991, his right arm was paralyzed, causing him ongoing <b>pain</b> <b>as</b> the muscles began to atrophy. It also caused problems with the sight in his right eye and he found communicating in full sentences difficult. At 2:00pm, on October 24, he attended an appointment with his doctor, Dr. Ronald Rich. He arrived in the building with his staff, and began to travel up to the ninth floor in the elevator. As they reached the fifth floor, he began struggling for breath, and was wheeled into the doctor's office, where he was reclined and a nurse administered oxygen. Barrett was sent for. Upon her arrival, she held Roddenberry while encouraging him to breathe. He had a cardiopulmonary arrest, and {{he died in the}} doctor's office shortly afterwards. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was attempted with no effect, and paramedics arrived to take him across the road to the Santa Monica Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E

40|$|We {{trace the}} {{development}} of Plato’s physiology of pleasure and pain from a rudimentary account in the "Gorgias" to a sophisticated account in the "Philebus". In the earlier account Plato treats <b>pains</b> <b>as</b> lacks and pleasures as replenishments. In the later account he treats pleasures and <b>pains</b> <b>as</b> in part object directed mental states. In particular, he treats <b>pains</b> <b>as</b> perceptions of disintegrated states which lack determinate being. We argue that Plato’s later account constitutes a considerable advance on previous theories of pain and on his own earlier theory. However, we point out that modern {{research has shown that}} Plato is wrong to identify pains with perceptions of disintegrated states. Nevertheless, we suggest that had Plato known about the results of modern research, he {{would have been able to}} say that pains are perceptions of threats of disintegration into the indeterminate...|$|R

5|$|Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, and <b>pain</b> <b>as</b> {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} karma. Various types of karma are classified according to their effects on the potency of the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (āsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the intentions behind those deeds. The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates any reliance on some supposed existence of divine grace or retribution. The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.|$|E
5|$|King Henry and King Stephen {{recognised}} <b>Pain</b> <b>as</b> {{the legitimate}} holder of the lands acquired through his wife Sybil. Her kinsman Gilbert de Lacy {{was the son}} of Roger de Lacy, who had been banished from England in 1095 and his English estates confiscated; he had though retained his properties in Normandy. Roger's English possessions were given to his brother Hugh de Lacy, from whom Sybil had inherited them. On Roger's death Gilbert inherited the lands in Normandy, and pressed his claim to the family's former English estates. Coplestone-Crow speculates that the uncertainty hanging over the inheritance was one reason why Pain endeavoured to secure more lands around Ludlow.|$|E
5|$|Pain is {{experienced}} by 53 {{percent of all}} people diagnosed with malignant cancer, 59 percent of people receiving anticancer treatment, 64 percent of people with metastatic or advanced-stage disease, and 33 percent of people after completion of curative treatment. Evidence for prevalence of pain in newly diagnosed cancer is scarce. One study found pain in 38 {{percent of people who}} were newly diagnosed, another found 35 percent of such people had experienced pain in the preceding two weeks, while another reported that pain was an early symptom in 18–49 percent of cases. More than one third of people with cancer pain describe the <b>pain</b> <b>as</b> moderate or severe.|$|E

5|$|The 1130 Pipe Roll {{noted that}} Pain was a royal justice in Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, and Pembroke. Besides the {{ordinary}} court, Pain also heard cases {{relating to the}} forest law in those counties. The Pipe Roll does not record <b>Pain</b> <b>as</b> sheriff in Shropshire, but this is likely because the Shropshire returns for that year are missing from it. Also in 1130, Pain was consulted by the king about the appointment to a vacant bishopric. The Diocese of Hereford had been vacant {{since the death of}} Richard de Capella in August 1127, and the king consulted with Pain and the constable of Hereford before accepting their candidate—Robert de Bethune, the prior of Llanthony Priory. In 1132 Pain was present, along with his brother, at the Christmas court held by King Henry. Subsequently Caus Castle, which was under Pain's control, was burnt by the Welsh in 1134. As lord of Caus, Pain was involved in efforts to suppress Welsh raiding. Although Pain held Caus, his title to the fortification was unclear, as it had earlier been held by Robert Corbet.|$|E
