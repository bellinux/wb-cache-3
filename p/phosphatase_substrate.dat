40|$|Protein {{phosphorylation}} homoeostasis is {{tightly controlled}} and pathological conditions {{are caused by}} subtle alterations of the cell phosphorylation profile. Altered levels of kinase activities have already been associated to specific diseases. Less {{is known about the}} impact of phosphatases, the enzymes that down-regulate phosphorylation by removing the phosphate groups. This is partly due to our poor understanding of the phosphatase-substrate network. Much of <b>phosphatase</b> <b>substrate</b> specificity is not based on intrinsic enzyme specificity with the catalytic pocket recognizing the sequence/structure context of the phosphorylated residue. In addition many phosphatase catalytic subunits do not form a stable complex with their substrates. This makes the inference and validation of phosphatase substrates a non-trivial task. Here, we present a novel approach that builds on the observation that much of <b>phosphatase</b> <b>substrate</b> selection is based on the network of physical interactions linking the phosphatase to the substrate. We first used affinity proteomics coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry to saturate the interactome of eight phosphatases whose down regulations was shown to affect the activation of the RAS-PI 3 K pathway. By integrating information from functional siRNA with protein interaction information, we develop a strategy that aims at inferring phosphatase physiological substrates. Graph analysis is used to identify protein scaffolds that may link the catalytic subunits to their substrates. By this approach we rediscover several previously described <b>phosphatase</b> <b>substrate</b> interactions and characterize two new protein scaffolds that promote the dephosphorylation of PTPN 11 and ERK by DUSP 18 and DUSP 26, respectively...|$|E

Applying this method to a purified protein, we could detect as little as 63 fg (0. 9 amol) of biotinylated bovine serum albumin. The sensitivity of the method was demonstrated by the detection of proteins from individual photoreceptor outer segments, including proteins constituting approximately 1 % of the total. Chemiluminescence detection also proved extremely sensitive for immunoblotting: a comparison of five methods for detection of antibody-antigen interactions showed that the AMPPD technique was more sensitive than detection with a colorimetric alkaline <b>phosphatase</b> <b>substrate,</b> 125 I-labeled protein A, 125 I-labeled anti-mouse IgG, or colloidal gold-conjugated anti-mouse IgG...|$|E

In this study, we evaluated its effectiveness at detecting endogenous AP activity by flow cytometry. METHODS: The ELF- 97 <b>phosphatase</b> <b>substrate</b> was used to detect endogenous AP activity in UMR- 106 rat osteosarcoma cells and primary cultures of chick chondrocytes. Cells were labeled with the ELF- 97 reagent and analyzed by flow cytometry using an argon ultraviolet (UV) laser. For comparison purposes, cells were also assayed for AP using a Fast Red Violet LB azo dye assay previously described for use in detecting AP activity by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The ELF- 97 <b>phosphatase</b> <b>substrate</b> effectively detected endogenous AP activity in UMR- 106 cells, with over 95 % of the resulting fluorescent signal resulting from AP-specific activity (as determined by levamisole inhibition of AP activity). In contrast, less than 70 % of the fluorescent signal from the Fast Red Violet LB (FRV) assay was AP-dependent, reflecting the high intrinsic fluorescence of the unreacted components. The ELF- 97 phosphatase assay was also able to detect very low AP activity in chick chondrocytes that was undetectable by the azo dye method. CONCLUSIONS: The ELF- 97 phosphatase assay was able to detect endogenous AP activity in fixed mammalian and avian cells by flow cytometry with superior sensitivity to previously described assays. This work also shows the applicability of ELF- 97 to flow cytometry, supplementing its previously demonstrated histochemical applications. Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E

Loss of Taz 1 (fission yeast ortholog of human TRF 1 /TRF 2) leads to stalled telomeric replication forks that trigger telomeric entanglements; the resolution of these entanglements fails at ≤ 20 °C. Here, we investigate these entanglements and their promotion by the conserved replication/repair protein Rif 1. Rif 1 plays no role in taz 1 Δ fork stalling. Rather, Rif 1 localizes to the anaphase mid-region and regulates the resolution of persisting DNA structures. This anaphase role for Rif 1 is genetically separate from the role of Rif 1 in S/G 2, though both roles require binding to PP 1 phosphatase, implying spatially and temporally distinct Rif 1 -regulated <b>phosphatase</b> <b>substrates.</b> Rif 1 thus acts as a double-edged sword.

Abolition of enzymatic activity by substitution of a serine for a critical cysteine in the first catalytic domain resulted in failure of this molecule to restore TCR signaling. Another mutation, in which a single amino acid substitution destroyed the myristylation site, resulted in failure of the chimeric molecule to partition to the plasma membrane. Although expressed at high levels and enzymatically active, this form of intracellular CD 45 also failed to restore normal signaling in CD 45 - T cells.

Chromosomes mis-segregated to these micronuclei are preferentially stained by the DNA damage marker γ-H 2 AX, suggesting that loss of PPP 6 C promotes both chromosome instability and DNA damage.

Autophosphorylation, transphosphorylation, and serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor protein kin-ases BRI 1 and BRI 1 -associated kinase (BAK 1) have increased {{the understanding of the}} regulatory role of those kinases during physiological and developmental processes in plants. The phosphorylation event initiated by BR is also found in the regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis and the sub-sequent degradation of the receptor. However, the basic molecular links of the BR signal transduction pathway are not well understood regarding this phosphorylation/dephosphorylation event. This re-view summarizes the current state of BR signal transduction research to uncover the phosphor-ylation/dephosphorylation networks and suggests directions for future research on steroid signal transduction to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the process.

40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} {{from the human}} tumor astrocytoma contains an active acid phosphatase activity based on hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Other acid <b>phosphatase</b> <b>substrates</b> [...] beta-glycerophosphate, O-phosphorylcholine, and 5 '-AMP [...] are not hydrolyzed significantly. The phosphatase activity is tartrate insensitive and is stimulated by Triton X- 100 and EDTA. Of the three known phosphoamino acids, only free O-phosphotyrosine is hydrolyzed by the membrane phosphatase activity. Other acid phosphatases tested from potato, wheat germ, milk, and bovine prostate did not show this degree of specificity. The {{plasma membrane}} activity also dephosphorylated phosphotyrosine histone at a much greater rate than did the other acid phosphatases. pH profiles for free O-phosphotyrosine and phosphotyrosine histone showed a shift toward physiological pH, indicating possible physiological significance. Phosphotyrosine histone dephosphorylation activity was nearly 10 times greater than that seen for phosphoserine histone dephosphorylation, and Km values were much lower for phosphotyrosine histone dephosphorylation (0. 5 microM vs. 10 microM). Fluoride and zinc significantly inhibited phosphoserine histone dephosphorylation. Vanadate, on the other hand, was a potent inhibitor of phosphotyrosine histone dephosphorylation (50 % inhibition at 0. 5 microM) but not of phosphoserine histone. ATP stimulated phosphotyrosine histone dephosphorylation (160 - 250 %) but inhibited phosphoserine histone dephosphorylation (95 %). These results suggest {{the existence of a}} highly specific phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase activity associated with the plasma membrane of human astrocytoma...|$|R
