5|$|By 2002 Sarumpaet had {{returned}} to Indonesia, where she debuted a stageplay entitled Alia, Luka Serambi Mekah (Alia, Wound of Serambi Mekah) at Ismail Marzuki Park in Jakarta; it was her first stageplay {{since the fall of}} Suharto. Dealing with Indonesian military operations in Aceh, the play was later performed in five other cities. In December 2002 it was scheduled to be broadcast on TVRI in commemoration of Human Rights Day, but <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last minute due to intervention from the military. In 2001, she and her troupe put on Dalam Kegelapan Panjang (In a Long Darkness), which dealt with the children of victims of the anti-communist purges of 1965–1966.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the group}} wanted to release an album cover using an edited image from a Holy Communion card, showing {{children}} joining hands. The image had been photocopied several times, {{so it had}} become distorted. The art direction was by John Maybury, a college friend of Morris. Their manager, Stevenson, was unable to determine who owned the copyright and advised that the band would be bankrupted if they were sued as a result. Polydor also became nervous about copyright infringement, so the artwork was <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last minute; the record company's executives also disliked its religious nature. A UK tour had already been scheduled {{to coincide with the}} release of the album, so there was no possibility of delaying the release.|$|E
500|$|... "Pinewood Derby" [...] {{has been}} noted for {{spoofing}} a number of world leaders, such as Gordon Brown, Silvio Berlusconi, Vladimir Putin, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Raila Odinga, Taro Aso, Han Seung-soo, Nicolas Sarkozy, Matti Vanhanen, Angela Merkel, Wen Jiabao and John Howard. The episode was originally scheduled to air on MTV Latin America in February 2010 but was <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last minute, allegedly due to its perceived negative portrayal of Mexican President Felipe Calderón.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pull <b>at</b> <b>the</b> anchor, man, <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> anchor!' my {{companion}} shouted, springing {{up from the}} seat. 'I understand it! <b>Pull</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> anchor!' ...|$|R

500|$|... "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" [...] was {{the first}} song {{released}} as a single. It reached number one in Raven's native Norway, and the top ten in both the United Kingdom and Germany. [...] "Blind As a Bat" [...] {{was scheduled to be}} released in the UK on December 18, but was then put back to February 26, as two CDs. In turn, this single was <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last minute, in favor of [...] "Cry Over Me", which was released on May 7, 2007.|$|E
2500|$|There was a {{great deal}} of secrecy {{surrounding}} the developments of Lambert's automobile. Operational tests were conducted with the window blinds <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> farm implement showroom where he ran it. Outside road tests were conducted at night on roads that were not used. That was a good thing since many times there were long intervals between being able to get the automobile started again after it stopped. It turned out that the villagers didn't even know what Lambert was working on since it was such a new concept. They didn't realize the significance of Lambert's horseless carriage. Lambert is said to have had the first automobile accident. One time when he was testing his [...] "horseless carriage" [...] at night in a secret run he drove his vehicle into a tree stump and ran into a hitching post.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final game}} ever {{played at the}} stadium was the {{afternoon}} of September 28, 2003, a 5-2 Phillies loss to the Atlanta Braves. [...] The final win was recorded by Greg Maddux of the Braves, the final loss by the Phils' Kevin Millwood. The final Phillies run was scored by Marlon Byrd {{at the top of}} the 3rd inning, and the final run altogether by the Braves' Andruw Jones on a double by Robert Fick (who also had the last hit at Tiger Stadium as a Detroit Tiger 4 years earlier) {{at the top of the}} 5th. The final hit at the Vet was a single by the Phills' Pat Burrell at the bottom of the 9th. The next batter, Chase Utley, grounded into a double play to end the game and the Vet. [...] However, the ceremony that followed <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> heartstrings of the sellout crowd. Both Paul Owens, a former general manager, and Tug McGraw, a former pitcher, made their final public appearances at the park that day; later that winter both men died. The last publicly broadcast words uttered in the park were by Harry Kalas — a veteran announcer who helped open the facility on April 10, 1971 — who paraphrased his trademark home run call: [...] "And now, Veterans Stadium is like a 3-1 pitch to Jim Thome or Mike Schmidt. It's on a looooooong drive...IT'S OUTTA HERE!!!" [...] The team moved into Citizens Bank Park in 2004, with the first game being played there on April 12, 2004.|$|E

6000|$|... "Send the {{children}} out of the room. Go!" [...] said he <b>pulling</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bell-rope. The urchins, always frightened before him, retired: their mother would have followed too. [...] "Not you," [...] he said. [...] "You stop." ...|$|R
60|$|Hardwick <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ends of his mustache, {{but he did}} {{not dare}} to reply after this.|$|E
60|$|He <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ragged blouse, and a {{scrap of}} soiled paper soon fell into his hand. The lad began to cry.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A sling on a forked stick. I understand!' he cried, and <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> elastic. 'But what {{wonderful}} beast yields this stretching leather?' ...|$|E
60|$|After this no man spake more, {{but each}} munched {{away at his}} bread and cheese lustily, with ever and anon a <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beer.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Sophy Wackles,' {{said the}} sharp child, with a {{superior}} smile, as she sucked her thumb just pricked by a too eager <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> thorny branches.|$|R
60|$|He <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{steering}} line, and ran {{the nose}} of the boat into the bank. Time was lost again in getting clear.|$|E
60|$|This {{appeared}} {{easier said}} than done. Helen could not watch Bo, because Ranger would not wait. He <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bridle and snorted.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'd better sit down," [...] {{said the}} great doctor professionally, and looked hard at him. Then he <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{arm of a}} chair.|$|E

60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{there was the}} sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, {{followed}} by a sharp <b>pull</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bell. Holmes whistled.|$|R
60|$|He {{hammered}} loudly at the knocker and <b>pulled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bell, {{but without}} any success. Holmes had slipped away, but he came {{back in a few}} minutes.|$|E
