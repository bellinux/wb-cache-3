The $395 HP-35, along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, used reverse Polish notation (RPN), also called <b>postfix</b> <b>notation.</b> A calculation like [...] "8 plus 5" [...] is, using RPN, performed by pressing [...] "8", [...] "Enter↑", [...] "5", and [...] "+"; instead of the algebraic infix notation: [...] "8", [...] "+", [...] "5", [...] "=".

This can be more natural and seem simpler than writing functions on the left in some areas – in linear algebra, for instance, when [...] is a row vector and [...] and [...] denote matrices and the composition is by matrix multiplication.

5000|$|Reverse Polish {{notation}} (RPN), {{also known}} as Polish <b>postfix</b> <b>notation</b> or simply <b>postfix</b> <b>notation,</b> is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN), in which operators precede their operands.

50|$|Calculators {{employing}} reverse Polish notation use a stack {{structure to}} hold values. Expressions {{can be represented}} in prefix, <b>postfix</b> or infix <b>notations</b> and conversion from one form to another may be accomplished using a stack.

40|$|A new {{and simple}} method for target code {{selection}} by tilling an abstract syntax tree is presented.

The use of the index allows to match patterns quickly, in time {{depending on the size of}} patterns and not depending on the size of the tree. The selection of a particular target instruction corresponds to a modification of the abstract syntax tree and also a corresponding incremental modification of the index is performed.

In RPN, the operator is placed after its operands, {{as opposed to the}} more common infix notation where the operator is placed between its operands. <b>Postfix</b> <b>notation</b> makes the language easier to parse and extend; Forth's flexibility makes a static BNF grammar inappropriate, and it does not have a monolithic compiler. Extending the compiler only requires writing a new word, instead of modifying a grammar and changing the underlying implementation.|$|E
5000|$|Like most {{scientific}} calculators, the SR-50 used ordinary infix notation, {{as opposed}} to the <b>postfix</b> Reverse Polish <b>Notation</b> (RPN) employed by its competitor, the Hewlett Packard HP-35. The SR-50 followed the standard order of operations by performing unary (single-argument) operations (reciprocal, square, square root, log, trig and hyperbolic trig functions) immediately, and multiplication, division, root, and power operations before addition and subtraction operations. As an example, the keypresses to calculate [...] "3 x log(4) + 5" [...] was entered almost as written, namely [...] "3 x 4 log + 5 =". This is because the calculator would execute the log function before performing the multiplication operation, and complete the multiplication operation before executing the addition operation. It did so by having unary operations operate on the X register, addition and subtraction operate on the X and Z registers, and multiplication, division, power, and root functions operate on the X and Y registers in its operational stack.|$|R
40|$|People with {{a cursory}} {{knowledge}} of electrical engineering are often {{led to believe}} that inside your average computer, there is a system of complicated circuits that ‘do the work’. Many do not realize, that in between the input, those complicated circuits, and the output, there is an embedded system: functioning as the go-between for the voltages on the keyboard keys and the chips that handle addition, subtraction, and display. The purpose of this project was to design that embedded system for an HP 20 b calculator–and over time, we did it. Carefully we progressed from displaying numbers on a screen to designing methods for the operations that make up the roots of arithmetic. By the end, our calculator could perform in two modes of operation, Reverse Polish <b>Notation</b> (<b>postfix)</b> i. e. 3 4 + » 7 and more standard infix notation i. e. 3 + 4 = 7.

50|$|When Polish {{notation}} {{is used as}} a syntax for mathematical expressions by {{programming language}} interpreters, it is readily parsed into abstract syntax trees and can, in fact, define a one-to-one representation for the same.
