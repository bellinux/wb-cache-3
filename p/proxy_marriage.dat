5|$|Four {{months after}} her <b>proxy</b> <b>marriage</b> to Louis, Sigismund entered Hungary and married Mary, but the {{reconciliation}} between the fractions {{turned out to be}} too late to forestall Charles' invasion. Sigismund fled to his brother's court in Prague in the autumn of 1385.|$|E
5|$|Mary's fiancé Sigismund and {{his brother}} Wenceslaus, King of Germany and Bohemia, were also opposed to Elizabeth and Garai. The queen dowager and the Palatine, on the other hand, were not {{enthusiastic}} about Sigismund reigning together with Mary. Both Sigismund and Charles schemed to invade Hungary; the former intended to marry Mary and become her co-ruler, while the latter intended to depose her. Elizabeth was determined to allow neither and, in 1384, started negotiating Mary's marriage to Louis of France, notwithstanding her daughter's engagement to Sigismund. Had this proposal been made after Catherine's death in 1378, the Western Schism would have represented a problem, with France recognising ClementVII as pope and Hungary accepting UrbanVI. However, Elizabeth was desperate to avoid an invasion in 1384 and unwilling to let the schism {{stand in the way}} of the negotiations with the French. ClementVII issued a dispensation which annulled Mary's betrothal to Sigismund, and her <b>proxy</b> <b>marriage</b> to Louis was celebrated in April 1385, but it was not recognized by the Hungarian noblemen, who adhered to Urban VI.|$|E

25|$|It was {{imperative}} for Charles {{to produce an}} heir as early as possible, and Don Juan arranged to find a suitable wife {{for him in the}} person of Marie Louise of Orléans. A <b>proxy</b> <b>marriage</b> ceremony took place in Paris on 30 August 1679. John died on 17 September 1679, and the queen-regent returned to court but from then on, the main influence over the affairs of Spain were to be the king's two consecutive wives, in particular the second one, the forceful Mariana of Neuburg.

The <b>proxy</b> <b>marriage</b> of state of his daughter Marie Louise of Austria to Napoleon on 10 March 1810 was arguably his most severe personal defeat. After the abdication of Napoleon following the War of the Sixth Coalition, Austria participated as a leading member of the Holy Alliance at the Congress of Vienna, which was largely dominated by Francis's chancellor Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich culminating in a new European map and the restoration of Francis' ancient dominions (except the Holy Roman Empire which was dissolved). Due {{to the establishment of}} the Concert of Europe, which largely resisted popular nationalist and liberal tendencies, Francis became viewed as a reactionary later in his reign.|$|E
25|$|In 1785, Henrique de Meneses, 3rd Marquis of Louriçal, {{arranged}} a marriage between John and the Infanta Carlota Joaquina of Spain, daughter of King Charles IV of Spain and Queen Maria Luisa of Parma. Like her betrothed, Carlota {{was a junior}} member of a royal family. Fearing a new Iberian Union, some in the Portuguese court viewed the marriage to a Spanish infanta unfavorably. She endured four days of testing by the Portuguese ambassadors before the marriage pact was confirmed. Because John and Carlota were related, {{and because of the}} bride's youth (she was only 10 years' old at the time), the marriage required a papal dispensation. After being confirmed, the marriage capitulation was signed in the throne room of the Spanish court with great pomp and with the participation of both kingdoms. It was followed immediately by a <b>proxy</b> <b>marriage.</b> The marriage was consummated five years later.|$|E

However, {{in the autumn}} of 1491, he renounced the treaty and married Margaret's stepmother Anne, Duchess of Brittany, for political reasons.

500|$|The 17-year-old PedroII was, for his part, {{clearly and}} greatly disappointed. His first {{impressions}} were only of her physical flaws—and {{of how much}} her appearance differed from the portrait which {{had been sent to}} him. Physically, she had dark brown hair and brown eyes, was short, slightly overweight, walked with a pronounced limp and, while not ugly, neither was she pretty. According to historian Pedro Calmon, Teresa Cristina had no true limp, but her odd way of walking was instead the result of bowed legs causing her to lean alternately right and left as she walked. PedroII's high expectations were crushed, and he allowed his feelings of revulsion and rejection to show. After a short interval, he left the ship. Perceiving his disillusionment, she burst into tears, lamenting that [...] "the emperor did not like me!" [...] Although a <b>proxy</b> <b>marriage</b> had already been performed, an extravagant state wedding was held on 4 September at the cathedral in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his youth, James {{was praised}} for his chastity, since he showed little {{interest}} in women. After the loss of Lennox, he continued to prefer male company. A suitable marriage, however, was necessary to reinforce his monarchy, and the choice fell on fourteen-year-old Anne of Denmark, younger daughter of Protestant Frederick II. Shortly after a <b>proxy</b> <b>marriage</b> in Copenhagen in August 1589, Anne sailed for Scotland but was forced by storms to the coast of Norway. On hearing that the crossing had been abandoned, James sailed from Leith with a 300-strong retinue to fetch Anne personally in what historian David Harris Willson called [...] "the one romantic episode of his life". The couple were married formally at the Bishop's Palace in Oslo on 23 November and returned to Scotland on 1 May 1590, after stays at Elsinore and Copenhagen and a meeting with Tycho Brahe. By all accounts, James was at first infatuated with Anne and, {{in the early years}} of their marriage, seems always to have showed her patience and affection. The royal couple produced three children who survived to adulthood: Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, who died of typhoid fever in 1612, aged 18; Elizabeth, later queen of Bohemia; and Charles, his successor. Anne died before her husband in March 1619.|$|E
2500|$|The Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV (1622–25), Rubens {{depicts the}} <b>proxy</b> <b>marriage</b> {{ceremony}} of the Florentine princess Marie de' Medici to the King of France, [...] Henry IV [...] {{which took place}} in the cathedral of Florence on October 5, 1600. Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini presides over the ritual. As was often the case with royal weddings, the bride's uncle, the Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany stood in the King's place and is pictured here slipping a ring on his niece's finger. All the surrounding figures are identifiable, including the artist himself. Although he was present at the actual event twenty years earlier, {{as a member of the}} Gonzaga household during his travels in Italy, Rubens appears youthful and stands behind the bride, holding a cross and gazing out at the viewer. It is highly unlikely that Rubens actually had such a pronounced presence in this scene when it took place. Those who attended the ceremony for Marie include Grand Duchess Cristina of Tuscany and Marie's sister Eleonora, Duchess of Mantua; and in entourage of Grand Duke are Roger de Bellegarde, Grand Esquire of France, and the Marquis de Sillery, who negotiated the marriage. As in other scenes in the Medici Cycle, Rubens includes a mythological element: the ancient god of marriage, Hymenaios [...] wearing a crown of roses, carries the bride's train in one hand and the nuptial torch in the other. The scene takes place below a marble statue, which depicts God the Father mourning over the dead body of Christ, alluding to the Pieta sculpture by Baccio Bandinelli (1493–1560).|$|E

In May 1950 the Peoples Republic of China enacted the New Marriage Law to tackle the sale of women into slavery. This outlawed <b>marriage</b> by <b>proxy</b> and made <b>marriage</b> legal so long as both partners consent. The New Marriage Law raised the {{legal age of marriage}} to 20 for men and 18 for women. This was an essential part of countryside land reform as women could no longer legally be sold to landlords. The official slogan was [...] "Men and women are equal; everyone is worth his (or her) salt".|$|R

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the role of}} marriage in society, focusing on the state 2 ̆ 7 s use of <b>marriage</b> as a <b>proxy</b> for desirable outcomes in social policy. Its analytical point of departure is the normative vision of modern marriage embraced by many of its proponents. From there, the idealized marriage is analyzed, not as a monolithic, opaque institution, but as one whose functional components may be identified and examined. The Article identifies the following as the primary functions of the normative marital family: expression; companionship; sex/procreation; caretaking; and economic support or redistribution. Analyzing the roles in society {{of each of these}} functions, it concludes that: (1) the expressive and companionate functions of marriage provide no societal benefit sufficient to justify state interference in those functions; (2) its purely sexual and procreative functions merit privacy and should, in all respects, be treated no differently than nonmarital sex and procreation; but (3) its caretaking and economic support functions benefit society significantly. Indeed, here the state 2 ̆ 7 s interest is at its apex. Accordingly, direct support of these two closely related functions, rather than the crude <b>proxy</b> of <b>marriage</b> in its entirety, should be the focus of state social policy in this area...|$|R

5000|$|Her {{marriage}} {{appears to}} have taken place only a few months before Osman's death. Acting as the sultan's <b>proxy</b> in the <b>marriage</b> was the prominent Jelveti sheikh Üsküdari Mahmud, among whose followers figured Esad Efendi. Nevizade Atai, compiler of a seventeenth century ulema biography, described Esad Efendi as [...] "a second Edebali" [...] because he was honored by the tie of marriage to the dynasty and foremost among the ulema. By the marriage of Akile Hatun to Osman II her father's relations with the sultan cooled, in part at least because of the marriage. Her marriage with Osman was a sharp break with the dynasty's tradition of avoiding legal alliances, especially with high born Muslim women and it contributed to the popular discontent that culminated in his deposition.|$|R

40|$|Family firms {{depend on}} a {{succession}} of capable heirs to stay afloat. If talent and IQ are inherited, this problem is mitigated. If, however, progeny talent and IQ display mean reversion (or worse), family firms are eventually doomed. This {{is the essence of}} the critique of family firms in Burkart, Panunzi and Shleifer (2003). Since family firms persist, solutions to this succession problem must exist. We submit that marriage can transfuse outside talent and reinvigorate family firms. This implies that changes to the institution of marriage – notably, a decline in arranged marriages in favor of marriages for “love” – bode ill for the survival of family firms. Consistent with this, the predominance of family firms correlates strongly across countries with plausible <b>proxies</b> for arranged <b>marriage</b> norms. Interestingly, family firm dominance interacted with arranged marriage norms also correlates with lower GDP per capita, suggesting that cultural inertia may also impede convergence to more efficient economic organization. ...|$|R
50|$|On 14 December 1362, Joanna {{contracted}} by <b>proxy</b> {{her third}} <b>marriage,</b> with James IV, titular King of Majorca and Prince of Achaea, who {{was ten years}} her junior. The wedding took place in person five months later, in May 1363 at Castel Nuovo. Unfortunately, this marriage was also turbulent: her new husband had been imprisoned for almost 14 years by his uncle King Peter IV of Aragon in an iron cage, an experience which left him mentally deranged. In addition to his poor mental state, another bone of contention between the couple was James IV's efforts {{to be involved in}} the government, although he was excluded from any role in the government of Naples in his marriage contract. Without hope of being King of Naples, James IV left Naples for Spain by the end of January 1366 and made an unsuccessful attempt to recapture Majorca. He was captured by King Henry II of Castile, who transferred him to Bertrand du Guesclin, who held him captive in Montpellier. He was ransomed by Joanna in 1370 and returned to her briefly, only to depart again, this time for good. He failed in an attempt to recapture Roussillon and Cerdanya in 1375, and fled to Castile where he died of illness or poison at Soria in February 1375.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} migratory process to the Indies as {{experienced}} by the Navarrans in the first centuries of the Modern Age, basing itself mainly on sources found in archives and employing a qualitative approach closer to social history and attitudes than to strict demography. The process in itself has been analysed, with an almost prosopographic vision of the emigrants, to discover the nature of Navarran participation in the American venture and the repercussions of the migratory phenomenon in the Old Kingdom on the emigrant"s return and/or his contributions {{to the land of}} origin. The study is structured into three sections following the biographical progression of the average emigrant of the age: prior to departure, his life and death in America, and his return, made a wealthy man (indiano), and/or the return of his assets in the form of remittance, inheritance or Assets of the Deceased. @@ As far as the scientific bibliography in existence prior to the present thesis centring strictly on the same subject matter is concerned, this can be said to have been scarce. It would first be necessary to quote the pioneering works of Caro Baroja, Otazu and Bilbao/Douglas in the 70 s, in addition to the biographic works of Eulogio Zudaire, which highlighted different aspects of the Navarran presence in colonial America and underlined its qualitative significance. The more recent research boom has been caused by the " 92 anniversary, several seminars and congresses with their relevant publications having been held in the years running up to the date. Among others, it is worth noting the I Basque Country History Congress (1987), part of the II World Basque Congress, with a section on "The Basques and America"; the I Scientific Reunion of the Spanish Modern History Association (1989) on "Spanish overseas emigration, 1492 - 1914 ", and the II General Congress of Navarran History (1990) with a specific volume containing the conferences and papers concerning Navarre and America, all of which helped define what was the state of the matter up to that point in time. Shortly afterwards a monograph entitled nothing other than "Navarra y América" (Ed. MAPFRE, 1992) was published, which summarised the history {{of the relationship between the}} Old Kingdom and the New World from the beginning of the process to the present day. This work remains one of the strongest contributions on the subject to date. @@ As for the methodology employed in writing up the thesis, the kind of sources consulted should be taken into account, its being a work essentially based on archive material. The main source used was procedural legal documentation from the Diocesan Archive of Pamplona (Episcopal Court section) and the General Archive of Navarre (Royal Courts section), complemented by the notary"s protocols from the same General Archive and the "Assets of the deceased" orders from the General Indies Archive in Seville (Contratación section). The worth and wealth of these sources is already fully recognised, particularly so that of the judicial proceedings, which directly reflect the life and times of a society whose customs, structures, conflicts and values all play their part in that attempt at laying down and defining reality which is a lawsuit. The lawsuits bring together a host of different types of documentation, many of which are of a notarial nature (testimonies, <b>proxies,</b> contracts of <b>marriage,</b> etc.). Particular mention should be made of the autographic letters written by emigrants found in amongst these proceedings and protocols, a great many of which are original. They provide us with a unique insight into the mentality of both a person and a society, as well as offering direct and assorted information as to social and cultural aspects of day-to-day life at the time (the most important of these letters have been reproduced in the appendix at the end of the thesis). @@ Finally, encapsulating some of the thesis" conclusions, it can be said that the Navarran process shares many things in common with that from other Iberian regions and a few, nonexclusive but significant particularities. Therefore, the process cannot be said to have been improvised, but rather based on family strategies and relationships between countrymen, founded on an awareness of native identity either created or strengthened by emigration, all of which enabled the movement of persons and properties, throughout the so-called Carrera de Indias, in one direction or another. Emigration to America gradually began to form part of the culture of many places and areas in Navarre, and remained so until recently. @@ Published by the Government of Navarre"s Príncipe de Viana Institution in the series Historia (nº 90, 1999) under the title of "Vida y fortuna del emigrante navarro a Indias.
