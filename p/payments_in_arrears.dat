The Committee found that the CSP is generally functioning as intended: evidence to the inquiry indicated that in approximately 75 - 80 per cent of child support cases, parents are meeting their child support obligations and have established friendly or cooperative post-separation relationships. As such, the challenge faced by this inquiry was to try and find ways to improve the system for people who are experiencing child support problems while not disrupting the areas in which the CSP is working well...|$|E

The Chinese construction industry is just recovering, with reported success, from {{an era of}} serious <b>payment</b> problems, manifested <b>in</b> high levels of arrears and prolonged payment delays. It has been seen that payment problems can arise from both contractual conflicts and willful delays. The Chinese government began to intervene <b>in</b> these <b>payment</b> issues during the late 1990 s, both by legislation and direct administrative input. Given {{the characteristics of the}} Chinese construction industry and its special payment problems, the direct administration mode was seen to be effective <b>in</b> reducing existing <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> <b>in</b> mainland China. For dealing with future problems, the Chinese government is engaged in formulating a "long-term mechanism.

The manor passed to John Colly, a distant Harington relative, in 1480 after a protracted legal dispute.

40|$|Payment by results - Pay organisations {{who receive}} public money {{for what they}} achieve for people, not simply {{what they do with}} them: for outcome, not process. The growing use of Payment by Results (PbR) has been met with concern by many in the {{voluntary}} sector. The principles of paying for impact and commissioning for outcomes are not commonly disputed. However, the way programmes are being designed and implemented is leading to questions about the viability of PbR as a method for improving public service delivery and for providing quality outcomes for service users. A key concern is that the level of financial risk and the amount of working capital required from PbR is preventing voluntary sector organisations from bidding for contracts regardless of their ability to deliver the desired outcomes. <b>Payment</b> <b>in</b> <b>arrears</b> and the risk of making a financial loss also have implications for the provider’s capacity to innovate and look for new ways of delivering services. Voluntary organisations are also facing PbR payment models which do not provide sufficient incentives for working with service users who require more complex, sustained or costly interventions, and there is concern about the impact which PbR is having on personalised outcomes. This paper explores the viability of PbR as an effective method for procuring public services, and in particular for harnessing the innovation and service quality which is delivered by the voluntary sector. It contains three chapters which address three key challenges to the voluntary sector’s capacity and appetite for PbR: 1) 	The financial and governance implications of PbR: we look at the ability of voluntary organisations to take on the risks of PbR and the impact which badly designed payment models have on provider behaviour. 2) 	Driving performance through innovation: we explore the impact which PbR has on the innovative capacity of the voluntary sector. 3) 	PbR outcomes and personalisation: we explain the centrality of personalisation to the voluntary sector and look at whether the outcomes-based commissioning model in PbR allows for increased personalisation of services to meet individuals’ needs...|$|R

3000|$|... 7 In {{the case}} of Family Credit {{there is a small}} {{proportion}} of the not entitled who are receiving (2.5 %) and this arises because there is no requirement to report changes in circumstances once eligibility is established and eligibility lasts for 6 months before it needs to be re-assessed. For CH there are further measurement difficulties: the reform resulted in a delay of up to six months while those who were in receipt of Family Credit got reassessed and then lost their conditional eligibility to CH transfers; there was some local authority discretion in the provision of nutrition transfers to children at school; and disabled children may be eligible but we cannot observe this in our data. Together these factors probably account for most of the ineligible CH participants. Housing Benefit has the largest proportion of participating ineligibles (9.3 %). Fry and Stark (1993) point out that this is largely because of processing delays that resulted <b>in</b> <b>payments</b> being made <b>in</b> <b>arrears</b> so that some households are currently observed to be in receipt for Housing Benefit but not entitled on the basis of current circumstances. This measurement error is unlikely to be correlated with our measures of other sources of income, but will reduce the precision of our Housing Benefit participation estimates.|$|R

Following the recession, the average house price in the Netherlands fell by almost 25 % {{and the proportion of}} homeowners with mortgage <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> nearly doubled. <b>In</b> this paper, we study mortgage <b>payment</b> <b>arrears</b> <b>in</b> the Netherlands and investigate the contribution of the credit crisis {{to the development of the}} current phenomenon of mortgage default.

The variables considered include: aggregate mortgage debt, mortgage interest rate, unemployment rate and the dissolution of families. The paper concludes that family break-down remains the most important risk factor associated with mortgage default in the Netherlands. The effect of unemployment is generally minor while mortgage interest rates have no statistically significant impact except that they implicitly contribute to the level of mortgage debt. The impact of mortgage debt on payment arrears is limited because of the unique characteristics of the housing market. OTBArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R
