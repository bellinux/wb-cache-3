It also eliminated the death penalty as a possible punishment. The latter half of the 19th century saw abortion become increasingly punished. One writer justified this by claiming that the number of abortions among married women had increased markedly since 1840. The Offences against the Person Act 1861 created a new <b>preparatory</b> <b>offence</b> of procuring poison or instruments with intent to procure abortion.

40|$|In England and Wales, Section 15 of the Sexual Offences Act (2003) criminalizes the act {{of meeting}} a child –someone under 16 —after grooming. The {{question}} to be pursued in this paper is whether grooming –I confine myself to online grooming—is justly criminalized. I shall argue that it is. One line of thought will be indirect. I shall first try to rebut a general argument against the criminalization of acts that are preparatory to the commission of serious offences. Grooming is one such act, but there are others, sometimes associated with terrorism. According to me, the general argument misapplies certain considerations about autonomy that are alleged {{to be in force}} in other areas of criminal law. Contrary to that general argument, criminalization of preparatory acts does not, in general, bypass the agency of citizens. Moreover, the criminalization of preparatory acts can disrupt activity that would have led to very serious crime, and with relatively low costs to the perpetrators, costs that reflect the non-occurrence of the more serious crime. There is evidence that grooming is harmful in itself, and so another point against the general argument is its assumption that <b>preparatory</b> <b>offences</b> are often harmless or at least victimless. There are objections to some of the undercover policing techniques that lead to a Section 15 prosecution, but these objections are not all weighty...|$|R
40|$|To date, 38 {{men have}} been charged with {{terrorism}} offences in Australia. Twenty-six have been convicted. The article commences with an overview of the factual circumstances leading to these convictions. This provides important background for the following discussion of a largely unexplored issue in Australian anti-terrorism law and policy, namely, the difficulties faced by the Australian courts in adapting traditional sentencing principles to the (for the most part, <b>preparatory)</b> terrorism <b>offences</b> enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament after the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks. Of particular interest are how the courts determine the objective seriousness of these offences and the respective weight placed upon deterrence (both specific and general) and the rehabilitation of convicted terrorists...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} whether Australia’s anti-terrorism financing laws can {{be justified}} by the rationales advanced in their support, given the scope, operation and effect of these laws. The thesis identifies two kinds of justificatory arguments advanced {{in support of the}} laws: harm related arguments, and arguments that appeal to Australian values and social cohesion. It is argued that the underlying rationale of the first sort of argument is the harm principle, and that the underlying rationale of the second sort of argument is legal moralism. The thesis then considers the justifiability of the laws by reference to these two rationales. Examination of the justifiability of the laws by reference to the harm principle involves a detailed discussion of the harm principle as espoused by both Mill and Feinberg, especially the definition of ‘harm’; how the harm principle can be applied in the case of political violence and whether all types of political violence encompassed by the definition of a ‘terrorist act’ in the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) cause ‘harm’ in the relevant sense; and whether the anti-terrorism financing laws, being laws that create <b>preparatory</b> <b>offences</b> and penalise the causing of remote harms or risk of remote harm, {{can be justified}} by the objectivist/subjectivist principles which govern the imputation of liability for remote harms. This examination reveals that certain types of political violence, being justified, do not constitute ‘harm’ in the sense relevant for the harm principle, and that some of the anti-terrorism financing sections can be justified by the harm principle supplemented by a subjectivist account of fair imputation of harm. Examination of the justifiability of the laws by reference to legal moralism involves reconstructing legal moralism as a coherent theory of criminalisation, identifying the common values of Australian society sought to be protected by the anti-terrorism financing laws, and examining how these laws affect the identified common values {{as a result of their}} potential to impose various funding prohibitions. In the course of this examination, it is argued that autonomy is the core Australian value and it is shown that some of the funding prohibitions imposed by the laws can have an overall negative impact on this core value of autonomy. The conclusions reached in this thesis, as a result of the above examinations, are contrary to the arguments often found in the literature, and are also somewhat counter-intuitive. First, contrary to the frequent contention that none of Australia’s anti-terrorism financing laws are justifiable on traditional criminalisation theories such as the harm principle, the thesis shows that some of these provisions can be justified by the harm principle supplemented by a subjectivist account of imputation of liability for remote harms. Second, the thesis shows that although the anti-terrorism financing laws are justified by legal moralism to a large degree, even a broad principle of criminalisation like legal moralism cannot fully justify the range of prohibitions imposed by these laws...|$|R
