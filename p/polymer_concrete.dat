50|$|<b>Polymer</b> <b>{{concrete}}</b> is concrete {{which uses}} polymers to bind the aggregate. <b>Polymer</b> <b>concrete</b> can gain {{a lot of}} strength in {{a short amount of}} time. For example, a polymer mix may reach 5000 psi in only four hours. <b>Polymer</b> <b>concrete</b> is generally more expensive than conventional concretes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polymer</b> <b>concrete</b> has {{historically}} not been widely adopted {{due to the}} high costs and difficulty associated with traditional manufacturing techniques. However, recent progress has led to significant reductions in cost, meaning {{that the use of}} <b>polymer</b> <b>concrete</b> is gradually becoming more widespread.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polymer</b> <b>concretes</b> are {{a type of}} <b>concrete</b> {{that use}} <b>polymers</b> to replace lime-type cements as a binder. In some cases the polymer is used in {{addition}} to portland cement to form <b>Polymer</b> Cement <b>Concrete</b> (PCC) or <b>Polymer</b> Modified <b>Concrete</b> (PMC). <b>Polymers</b> in <b>concrete</b> have been overseen by Committee 548 of the American Concrete Institute since 1971.|$|R
25|$|<b>Polymer</b> <b>concretes</b> are {{mixtures}} of aggregate {{and any of}} various polymers and may be reinforced. The cement is more costly than lime-based cements, but <b>polymer</b> <b>concretes</b> nevertheless have advantages, they have significant tensile strength even without reinforcement, and they are largely impervious to water. They are frequently used for repair and construction of other applications such as drains.|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} <b>polymers</b> in <b>concrete</b> is {{consolidated}} {{in the construction}} industry. The future of <b>polymers</b> in <b>concrete</b> is governed by the synergic interaction between these materials, in order to contribute significantly towards a more sustainable construction. Concrete-polymer composites (C-PC) have excellent mechanical and durability properties. Appropriate combination of polymers and classical construction materials provides opportunities for innovative applications and systems. This paper highlights the innovations and new approaches presented at the 13 th International Congress on <b>Polymers</b> in <b>Concrete</b> in Madeira, Portugal, 2010 and at the 7 th Asian Symposium on <b>Polymers</b> in <b>Concrete</b> in Istanbul, Turkey, 2012.

50|$|<b>Polymer</b> <b>concrete</b> may be {{used for}} new {{construction}} or repairing of old concrete. The adhesive properties of <b>polymer</b> <b>concrete</b> allow repair of both polymer and conventional cement-based concretes. The low permeability and corrosive resistance of <b>polymer</b> <b>concrete</b> allows it to be used in swimming pools, sewer structure applications, drainage channels, electrolytic cells for base metal recovery, and other structures that contain liquids or corrosive chemicals. It is especially suited to the construction and rehabilitation of manholes due to their ability to withstand toxic and corrosive sewer gases and bacteria commonly found in sewer systems. Unlike traditional concrete structures, <b>polymer</b> <b>concrete</b> requires no coating or welding of PVC-protected seams. It can also be used as a bonded wearing course for asphalt pavement, for higher durability and higher strength upon a concrete substrate.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSelf healing {{phenomenon}} of concrete {{has been observed}} in traditional, fibrous, self compacting concrete. This phenomenon occurred mainly due {{to the presence of}} unhydrated cement particles in the presence of water. Mechanism of <b>polymer</b> in <b>concrete</b> depends on creating a layer and net of polymer around cement particles which enhances the properties of <b>polymer</b> modified <b>concrete.</b> This mechanism may affect the self healing of this type of concrete. This work aims to study the presence of the self healing phenomenon in <b>polymer</b> modified <b>concrete</b> and the related parameters. An experimental investigation on self healing of <b>polymer</b> modified <b>concrete</b> was undertaken. In this research work, effect of polymer type, polymer dose, cement content, cement type, w/cm ratio and age of damage were studied. The healing process extended up to 60 days. Ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements were used to evaluate the healing process. Results indicated that, the self healing phenomenon existed in <b>polymer</b> modified <b>concrete</b> as in traditional concrete. The increase of polymer dose increases the healing degree at the same healing time. This increase depends on polymer type. Also, the decrease of w/cm ratio reduces the self healing degree while the use of Type V Portland cement improves the self healing process compared with Type I Portland cement. Cement content has an insignificant effect on healing process for both concrete with and without polymer. In addition, the increase of damage age decreases the efficiency of self healing process...|$|R

Results of 24 flax fibre-reinforced <b>polymer</b> tube-confined plain <b>concrete</b> and coir fibre-reinforced concrete cylinders under axial compression are presented. Test results show that both flax fibre-reinforced <b>polymer</b> tube-confined plain <b>concrete</b> and fibre-reinforced concrete offer high axial compressive strength and ductility.

40|$|Characterizing, handling, {{and storing}} tritiated waste is {{challenging}} {{because of the}} {{physical and chemical properties}} of tritium. Tritium is soluble in many materials, including structural materials such as, stainless steel, structural steel, <b>polymers,</b> <b>concrete</b> and paints. Tritium permeates rapidly into these materials compared to other species, and so parts exposed to tritium are normally contaminated to some degree throughout the bulk. The relatively low kinetic energy of the {beta}-decay causes detecting tritium anywhere but very near the surface of materials to be impossible, because the {beta}-particle is absorbed by the material. Tritium readily exchanges with hydrogen in water vapor, and the resulting tritiated water can permeate <b>polymers,</b> <b>concrete,</b> oil, and the oxide surface films normally present on metals. Most of the tritium contamination in structural metals resides in the surface oxide film and in organic films at the surface, when metals are exposed to tritium at ambient temperature and pressure, whether the exposure is to gas or tritiated water. The most reliable method of assaying tritium is to dissolve samples in a proper liquid scintillant and use {beta}-scintillation counting. Other methods that require less time or are non-destructive (such as smear/counting) are significantly less reliable, but they can be used for routine waste characterization if sample dissolution/liquid scintillation counting is regularly employed to benchmark them...|$|R

50|$|The popular {{trend in}} trench drains are linear systems. Linear as in line drain. Made from {{materials}} such as <b>polymer</b> <b>concrete,</b> fiberglass, structural plastic and steel, liner systems are the channel and grate components that are assembled in the trench and around which concrete is poured to form a drain system. By themselves, these liner systems {{do not have the}} strength and integrity to hold up under the physical requirements needed for the drain. A concrete (or asphalt) drain body is required to encase the channel to give the channel compressive strength and rigidity to ensure the drain will be able to withstand the traffic load it was designed to handle.|$|E
50|$|Trench drains {{are made}} in a factory that specializes in making {{concrete}} shapes. The channel pieces range in width and length, larger channels requiring heavy equipment to move them, however most channels can be picked up and moved easily by hand. The channels are formed in large metal forms that (usually) have a pre-determined channel width, depth, and slope. Like in the cast-in-place method, a metal frame {{is attached to the}} form and concrete is poured and finished in a factory atmosphere. The advantage to the pre-cast trench drain is again time savings - big time savings at the job site. Pre-cast trench drains made of a <b>polymer</b> <b>concrete</b> are also more sturdy and reliable than cast-in-place trenches. Once a trough is dug, the pre-cast trench sections can be installed and quickly be put into service through numerous methods. A patty method can be used by placing clumps of concrete at each trench drain channel joint and the channels can be levelled and set as such. Further installation methods involve clipping rebar through installation device used with the channel. Concrete will need to be poured to surround the trench drain so that the load can be transferred from the channel and grate to the surrounding areas.|$|E
