5|$|Beattie and {{his team}} had noticed that someone else had {{attempted}} to exhume Hartnell. In the effort, a <b>pickaxe</b> had damaged the wooden lid of his coffin, and the coffin plaque was missing. Research in Edmonton later showed that Sir Edward Belcher, commander {{of one of the}} Franklin rescue expeditions, had ordered the exhumation of Hartnell in October 1852, but was thwarted by the permafrost. A month later, Edward A. Inglefield, commander of another rescue expedition, succeeded with the exhumation and removed the coffin plaque.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} common eland is Taurotragus oryx, composed of three words: tauros, tragos and oryx. Tauros is Greek for a bull or bullock, meaning {{the same as the}} Latin taurus. Tragos is Greek for a male goat, referring to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear and its resemblance to a goat's beard. Oryx is Latin and Greek (generally orygos) for <b>pickaxe,</b> referring to the pointed horns of North African antelopes like the common eland and scimitar-horned oryx.|$|E

As a three-year-old in 1817 he won the Riddlesworth Stakes at Newmarket and a Produce Sweepstakes at Doncaster. A match between Young Wizard and <b>Pickaxe</b> at Newmarket {{finished}} in a dead heat. He also finished second to Azor in the Derby. In 1818 he beat Sir Thomas in a match race and won a race at Ascot Heath in 1819.|$|E
5|$|Ann Marten {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} {{of the events of}} the day of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams. Thomas Marten then told the court how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George Marten revealed that he had seen Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later had seen him walking from the barn with a <b>pickaxe.</b> Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had never wanted to marry Maria, but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's father had been a source of tension between them.|$|E
5|$|Demolition of the spina of Borgo {{began with}} Mussolini's {{symbolic}} strike {{of the first}} building with a <b>pickaxe</b> on 29 October 1936 and continued for twelve months. Even at the time, the demolition proved controversial, with many Borgo residents displaced en masse to settlements ("borgate") outside of the city. Among the buildings dismantled, either totally or in part, and rebuilt in another position, were the Palazzo dei Convertendi, the house of Giacomo Bartolomeo da Brescia, the Church of the Nunziatina, the palaces Rusticucci-Accoramboni and degli Alicorni (the latter had been already demolished in 1931). Other buildings, like the palace of the Governatore di Borgo and the Churches of San Giacomo Scossacavalli and Sant'Angelo al Corridore, were destroyed. Facing into the cleared area are five other historical buildings, the Palazzo Giraud Torlonia, the church of Santa Maria in Traspontina, the Palazzo dei Penitenzieri, Palazzo Serristori, and Palazzo Cesi (which was mutilated).|$|E
5|$|On May 3, Helen Reed {{is seen by}} the Phantom {{leaving a}} grocery store. At home that night, Helen asks her husband Floyd, who is {{sitting in front of}} a window in his armchair, if he hears {{somebody}} walking outside. After he replies that he does not, the Phantom shoots him through their window. Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying. As she uses the telephone to call police, the Phantom breaks through the screen door and shoots her twice in the face. Despite her wounds, she drags herself {{out of the house and}} into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd's body. The Phantom stalks her with a <b>pickaxe,</b> but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house. News of this attack causes the town to panic, and people begin boarding up their windows.|$|E

25|$|Sometime between 10:15 and 11:15 pm, a drunk McGreavy became infuriated {{with the}} Ralph children, {{beginning}} with the baby, Samantha, who had been crying for her bottle. McGreavy violently killed Samantha {{and then the other}} two children, each in a different manner. Eight-month-old Samantha died from a fractured skull, 2-year-old Dawn had her throat slit and 4-year-old Paul was strangled. After killing the three children, McGreavy went down to the basement and retrieved a <b>pickaxe.</b> He further mutilated their bodies with the <b>pickaxe</b> before impaling the three bodies on the spikes of a wrought iron fence in a neighbour's yard. He then left the home.|$|E
25|$|On October 23, 1936 (the {{day after}} {{the anniversary of the}} March on Rome), the Duce himself, {{standing}} on a roof, gave the first stroke of the <b>pickaxe.</b> On October 8, 1937 (less than one year later), the spina had ceased to exist, and Saint Peter was freely visible from Castel Sant'Angelo.|$|E

In the destruction layer were found the remnants of the upper floor, which collapsed into the floor below. The remains of weapons, probably the defenders', were also found at the site. These include a sword, a scabbard, a <b>pickaxe,</b> a dagger and an umbo, a rare feature of the Byzantine weapons repertoire.|$|E

On 25 October 2010 five SHAC members received prison sentences for threatening HLS staff. SHAC has also been accused of encouraging arson and violent assault. An HLS director was assaulted in front of his child. HLS managing director Brian Cass was sent a mousetrap primed with razor blades, and in February 2001 was attacked by three men armed with <b>pickaxe</b> handles and CS gas. Another businessman with links to HLS was attacked and knocked unconscious adjacent to a barn his assailants had set alight.|$|E
25|$|Powell {{decided to}} return to Surratt's {{boarding}} house to seek help. His clothes were somewhat bloody from the attack at Seward's home, and he'd dropped his hat at the Seward home. During much of the Victorian era, it was considered unseemly for any man (even a menial laborer) to be seen in public without a hat, and Powell would have been viewed with suspicion had he tried to enter the city without one. Ripping the sleeve from his undershirt, Powell placed the sleeve on his head in the hope that people would think it was a stocking cap. To complete his disguise as a common laborer, he then stole a <b>pickaxe</b> from a farmyard. Powell then headed for Surratt's.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{work on the}} law courts of Aix-en-Provence was suspended, and Ledoux was accused of embroiling the Treasury in ill-considered expenditure. When the Revolution broke out, his rich {{clientele}} emigrated or perished under the guillotine. He saw his career and his projects stopped {{while at the same}} time the first blows of the <b>pickaxe</b> began to ring on the already obsolete wall of the fermiers généraux. As of June 1790, the Ferme générale had been able to install its employees in the buildings by Ledoux, but the octroi (granting) was abolished in May 1791, which rendered the facilities useless. A symbol of fiscal oppression, Ledoux, who had amassed a handsome fortune, was arrested and thrown in La Force Prison.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy is}} under the player's control {{throughout}} the game, and is adjustable in multiple ways. For example, the player can control the distribution of goods by selecting which percentage of a given resource is transported to a given building. In a similar manner, the player can select what tools are made when. Tool production is important insofar as all buildings require raw materials and a worker with the right tool. For example, if the player has built a mine, and the building is still empty {{despite the presence of}} idle settlers, a <b>pickaxe</b> will need to be manufactured in the toolsmith. The game also uses a notification system that alerts the player if a building cannot be occupied either {{due to a lack of}} the right tool or the absence of available settlers.|$|E
25|$|In {{another version}} of the myth, Goram dug the Avon Gorge himself {{and there is no}} sign of Vincent in the story. Having {{completed}} the job, he carelessly fell over a barrow called Maes Knoll, on Dundry Hill south of Bristol, and plunged into the Severn estuary, as above. In yet another, Vincent and Goram shared a <b>pickaxe</b> as they went about their labours, and Vincent accidentally killed Goram by throwing it to him inaccurately halfway through their respective jobs. Vincent finished the Avon Gorge out of remorse and did some other major construction work like the Stanton Drew stone circles and even Stonehenge. One or the other giant is said to have created Maes Knoll hillfort and the pre-Anglo-Saxon period linear earthwork Wansdyke, south-east of Bristol, more or less accidentally with his digging tools. There are other variants.|$|E
25|$|In late May and June 1945, {{when the}} Yugoslav army started {{emptying}} its prison camps in Slovenia, prisoners from the Teharje camp and the Stari Pisker prison were brought by trucks {{at night to}} the abandoned Barbara Pit mine in Huda Jama. Slovene Home Guard POWs that were singled out in Slovenj Gradec, Velenje, Kranj and Celje were {{the first ones to}} arrive on the last week of May. NDH troops were brought on foot. Once arrived, groups of 5-6 prisoners with hands tied with wire were stripped, ordered to kneel above a mine shaft and shot in the head, or were hit with a mine hammer or a <b>pickaxe.</b> In some cases, groups of 20-30 prisoners were tossed into a mine shaft, followed with hand grenades to finish off the victims. A number of prisoners were thrown in alive. Once the shafts were filled with corpses, the remaining prisoners were sent in the direction of Zagorje in northwest Croatia where they were killed, while the bodies were covered with lime to speed up decomposition. The mine was then enclosed with 400 cubic meters of concrete and wooden barriers. Those still conscious tried to climb over each other to reach the hatch, but could not escape the sealed mine.|$|E
25|$|In the mines, Emma {{interrupts}} the dwarves' work {{by taking}} Happy's <b>pickaxe.</b> This infuriated the dwarves, {{causing them to}} take their complaints to David and Mary Margaret. They interrupt David, Mary Margaret and Regina from researching what they were searching for in Camelot: The Crimson Crown. Following the dwarves' complaints, David blames himself for not saving Emma. However, David is interrupted by Arthur, who tells David that key items from his camp, including a magic bean that would take the displaced Camelot residents home, is missing. David and Arthur stop by the pawnshop first to acquire an item, then begin their search at the Arthurians' camp, where David asks the campers to drink from the Chalice of Vengeance. This points him {{in the direction of}} the thief, revealed to be Arthur's squire, Grif, who immediately takes off on horseback, which leads to David and Arthur chasing Grif in David's pickup. David gives Arthur a crash course lesson in driving as he takes a piece of wood, using it as a makeshift joust, and knocks Grif off his horse. Grif later wakes up in the Sheriff's jail and admits that he was tired of how he was being treated, causing him to want to hurt the King. However, there was no magic bean found among the stolen items, but at the camp, David recognized the Crimson Crown on the ground and took it to Regina, who had also seen the question mark that she had handwritten on its illustration back in Camelot.|$|E

On Mawson's sledge they had their stove, fuel, sleeping bags, and ten days' worth of food. Their best immediate hope was to reach the camp of two days earlier where they had left the abandoned sledge and supplies, [...] west. They reached it in five-and-a-half-hours, where Mertz used the tent cover, with the runners from the abandoned sledge and a ski as poles, to erect a shelter.|$|E

500|$|During {{its entire}} operation, Treblinka I's commandant was Sturmbannführer Theodor van Eupen. He ran the camp with several SS men and almost 100 Hiwi guards. The quarry, spread over {{an area of}} , {{supplied}} road construction material for German military use and {{was part of the}} strategic road-building programme in the war with the Soviet Union. It was equipped with a mechanical digger for shared use by both Treblinka I and II. Eupen worked closely with the SS and German police commanders in Warsaw during the deportation of Jews in early 1943 and had prisoners brought to him from the Warsaw Ghetto for the necessary replacements. According to Franciszek Ząbecki, the local station master, Eupen often killed prisoners by [...] "taking shots at them, as if they were partridges". A widely feared overseer was Untersturmführer Franz Schwarz, who executed prisoners with a <b>pickaxe</b> or hammer.|$|E
500|$|The {{formation}} of the Avon Gorge {{is the subject of}} mediaeval mythology. The myths tell tales of two giant brothers, Goram and Vincent, who constructed the gorge. One variation holds that Vincent and Goram were constructing the gorge together and Goram fell asleep, to be accidentally killed by Vincent's <b>pickaxe.</b> Another variation tells of the brothers falling for Avona, a girl from Wiltshire, who instructs the giants to drain a lake which stretches from Rownham Hill to Bradford-on-Avon (i.e. the Avon valley). Goram began digging the nearby Hazel Brook Gorge in Blaise Castle estate, but consumed too much beer and fell asleep. Vincent dug the Avon Gorge and drained the lake, winning the affection of Avona. Upon waking Goram stamped his foot, creating [...] "The Giant's Footprint" [...] in the Blaise Castle estate, and threw himself into the Bristol Channel, turning to stone and leaving his head and shoulder above water as the islands of Flat Holm and Steep Holm.|$|E
500|$|The first archaeological {{report on}} the then {{demolished}} church of St Mary was published by George Dowker in 1878. He described finding {{the foundations of the}} apsidal chancel and of the columns that formed part of the triple chancel arch, and noted that the original floor of the church was of concrete, or opus signinum, more than [...] thick. The floor had previously been described in 1782, prior to the church's demolition, as polished smooth and finished in red, a sample having been taken with difficulty using a <b>pickaxe.</b> Within the floor Dowker also found what he believed were the foundations for the stone cross described by Leland, and noted that the concrete floor appeared to have been laid around them. The floor of the chancel appeared to have been raised by about [...] when the chancel was extended in the Early English period, and had been covered with encaustic tiles. Dowker also reported hearing from a Mr Holmans about the existence of a large, circular burial vault at the east end of the chancel, containing coffins arranged in a circle.|$|E
500|$|Donald B. Wagner {{writes that}} most {{domestic}} iron tools and implements produced during the Han {{were made of}} cheaper and more brittle cast iron, whereas the military preferred to use wrought iron and steel weaponry due to their more durable qualities. During the Han dynasty, the typical [...] bronze sword found in the Warring States period was gradually replaced with an iron sword measuring roughly [...] in length. The ancient dagger-axe (ge) made of bronze was still used by Han soldiers, although it was gradually phased out by iron spears and iron ji halberds. Even arrowheads, which were traditionally made of bronze, gradually only had a bronze tip and iron shaft, {{until the end of}} the Han when the entire arrowhead was made solely of iron. Farmers, carpenters, bamboo craftsmen, stonemasons, and rammed earth builders had at their disposal iron tools such as the plowshare, <b>pickaxe,</b> spade, shovel, hoe, sickle, axe, adze, hammer, chisel, knife, saw, scratch awl, and nails. Common iron commodities found in Han dynasty homes included tripods, stoves, cooking pots, belt buckles, tweezers, fire tongs, scissors, kitchen knives, fish hooks, and needles. Mirrors and oil lamps were often made of either bronze or iron. Coin money minted during the Han was made of either copper or copper and tin smelted together to make the bronze alloy.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the first}} few months of weekly Mr. Dooley columns, in 1893 and 1894, the {{character}} of Dooley began to take shape. The backstory that Dunne gave Dooley began with the future bartender's birth in County Roscommon, Ireland (which had given birth to McGarry), about sixty years previously. Dooley was one of the roughly 2,000,000 Irish people who emigrated to North America during the Potato Famine (1845–50), coming across on one of the coffin ships, and later spoke of the hardships and deaths on the journey. Arriving in New York, he tried Pittsburgh and St. Louis, and settled in Chicago in the early 1850s. He worked in the typical occupations available to Irish of the time, as a laborer swinging a <b>pickaxe</b> and then driving horse-drawn wagons; but found these employments not to his liking, as each was dominated by Irishmen from counties other than Roscommon. He remains suspicious of, or even hostile towards, men from certain other counties, with [...] "sheep-stealin' Mayo men" [...] heading the list. Tiring of employed labor, he established a bar on Archer Avenue, spending the Civil War there. His bar became the sort of community tavern around which, together with home and church, Irish life revolved. He interested himself in Democratic Party politics, and after a successful two-year term as a precinct captain between 1873 and 1875, was mentioned for the post of city alderman but was not selected to be a candidate. He remains a bachelor, running his bar which caters to rolling mill workers employed nearby, and dubs himself a [...] "saloonkeeper and Doctor of Philosophy".|$|E
