40|$|Abstract. The {{definition}} and {{the sources of}} the <b>particulate</b> <b>pollutant</b> in the transformer oil were described in the article. The prevention and elimination of the <b>particulate</b> <b>pollutant</b> were introduced as well. The Definition of the <b>Particulate</b> <b>Pollutant</b> in the Transformer Oil The <b>particulate</b> <b>pollutant</b> in the transformer oil included all the insoluble precipitate and suspended mechanical impurities existed in the oil, such as sand, clay, metal particles, fibers, dust, etc. [1]. They were non-oil components, non-molecular state solids suspended or precipitated in the oil, tested as sphere, also called impurity particles. Particle size referred to the diameter of spheric particle, which could be divided into several grades according to the range of diameter, such as 0. 5 ~ 0. 7 µm, 0. 7 ~ 1 µm, 1 ~ 2 µm and so on. The particle concentration represented the number of the particles contained in 10 mL or 100 mL oil, also known as the particle pollution degree, which could be expressed as No/ 10 mL (number of particles in 10 mL oil) [2]. The Sources of the <b>Particulate</b> <b>Pollutant</b> in the Transformer Oil From the Refining, Caging and Transportation Process of the Transformer Oil. There were some mechanical impurities even in the qualified new transformer oil if the oil was not highly refined...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>particulate</b> air <b>pollutants</b> and respiratory symptoms in children {{has not been}} consistent among studies, potentially owing to differences in the inflammatory response to different <b>particulate</b> air <b>pollutants.</b> This study aimed to investigate the effect of <b>particulate</b> air <b>pollutants</b> on respiratory symptoms and the inflammatory response in schoolchildren. Three hundred-and-sixty children {{were included in the}} study. The children recorded daily respiratory symptom scores for October 2015. In addition, the daily amount of interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α production was assessed in THP 1 cells stimulated with suspended particulate matter (SPM), which was collected every day during the study period. Generalized estimating equation logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the associations among respiratory symptoms and the daily levels of SPM, IL- 6, IL- 8, and TNF-α. Daily SPM levels were not associated with respiratory symptoms or the daily IL- 6, IL- 8, and TNF-α levels. Conversely, there was a significant association between respiratory symptoms and the daily IL- 6, IL- 8, and TNF-α levels. These results suggested that the effects of <b>particulate</b> air <b>pollutants</b> on respiratory symptoms in schoolchildren might depend more on the pro-inflammatory response to them than on their mass concentration...|$|R

30|$|Fine {{particulate}} matter is, {{on account of}} its aerodynamic properties and typical composition (especially diesel {{particulate matter}} and carbonaceous particles) the <b>particulate</b> <b>pollutant</b> potentially most harmful to cultural heritage, representing an aesthetic issue and an agent of chemical degradation simultaneously. This paper reviews the current knowledge of the life-cycle of fine particulates, focussing on diesel particulate matter from emission to deposition, including its aesthetic and chemical consequences, and draws attention to some imbalances in {{the current state of}} research. The currently available measurements are biased towards coarse dust, and information on the consequences of particle deposition is largely restricted to the outdoor environment. More evidence on the chemical effects of the most common types of fine particulate matter in typical indoor materials is needed to enable risk assessment for indoor collections.|$|R

Stop flow experiments were conducted in laboratory columns with the sediment of a retention-infiltration pond. Trace metals behave differently, depending on their interaction with colloidal particles. Lead, zinc, cadmium and chromium are not sensitive to variations of flow.

Inhalation of <b>particulate</b> air <b>pollutants</b> aggravates respiratory symptoms in patients with chronic airway diseases, but the mechanisms underlying this response remain poorly understood. Diesel exhaust particles induced airway hyperresponsiveness and Ym mRNA expression via a Th 2 cell-biased response, which synthesized by activated macrophages are homologous to chitinase and have chitinase activity. Alveolar macrophages {{play an important role}} in particles-induced airway and lung inflammation via direct production of IL- 13. Treatment of epithelial cells with bovine serum albumin coated titanium dioxide particles altered 20 protein spots on the two-dimensional gel, and these were then analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS. These proteins included defense-related, cell-activating, and cytoskeletal proteins implicated in the response to oxidative stress. TiO 2 treatment was found to increase the amount of mRNA for macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF). MIF was expressed primarily in epithelium and was elevated in lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of TiO 2 -treated rats as compared with sham treated rats. Carbon black and diesel exhaust particles also induced expression of MIF protein in the epithelial cells. We attempt to offer insight into how particles may influence airway inflammation...|$|R

50|$|The {{deposition}} of <b>particulate</b> <b>pollutants</b> into the lungs is necessary before the particles can {{travel through the}} mucus into the lung tissue. There are four mechanisms of deposition: interception, impaction, gravitational settling, and Brownian diffusion. Interception happens when a particle is removed after brushing up against an obstacle. Impaction happens when the particle collides into {{the surface of the}} respiratory tract due to the high inertia. Gravitational settling is influenced by the force of gravity which causes the particle to settle on the respiratory tract. Brownian motion causes the random collision of gas molecules against the particle, until the particle goes into the respiratory tract.|$|E
5000|$|Nasal mucus is {{produced}} by the nasal mucosa; and mucosal tissues lining the airways (trachea, bronchus, bronchioles) {{is produced}} by specialized airway epithelial cells (goblet cells) and submucosal glands.

This event along with the continual movement of the respiratory mucus layer toward the oropharynx, helps prevent foreign objects from entering the lungs during breathing. This explains why coughing often occurs in those who smoke cigarettes. The body's natural reaction is to increase mucus production. In addition, mucus aids in moisturizing the inhaled air and prevents tissues such as the nasal and airway epithelia from drying out. [...] Nasal and airway mucus is produced continuously, with most of it swallowed subconsciously, even when it is dried.|$|E
50|$|The London {{plane is}} a large {{deciduous}} tree growing 20 - 30 m, exceptionally over 40 m tall, with a trunk up to 3 m or more in circumference. The bark is usually pale grey-green, smooth and exfoliating, or buff-brown and not exfoliating. The leaves are thick and stiff-textured, broad, palmately lobed, superficially maple-like, the leaf blade 10 - 20 cm long and 12 - 25 cm broad, with a petiole 3 - 10 cm long. The young leaves in spring are coated with minute, fine, stiff hairs at first, but these wear off and by late summer the leaves are hairless or nearly so. The flowers are borne in one to three (most often two) dense spherical inflorescences on a pendulous stem, with male and female flowers on separate stems. The fruit matures in about 6 months, to 2 - 3 cm diameter, and comprises a dense spherical cluster of achenes with numerous stiff hairs which aid wind dispersal; the cluster breaks up slowly over the winter to release the numerous 2 - 3 mm seeds. The London Plane {{is one of the}} most efficient trees in removing small <b>particulate</b> <b>pollutants</b> in urban areas.|$|E

The two bus stations consisted of markedly different site geography and surroundings with one situated in a street canyon and the other elevated above ground level. The same flow of traffic operated through both stations. Real time measurements of ultrafine particle concentration, size distribution and meteorological conditions were carried out on the platform continuously over several days.

Factor analysis combined with cluster analysis was used to derive circulation types based on surface meteorological data for the period 1954 - 1999 in Athens and on surface pressure grid data. The city was divided into three sectors according to the financial and social activities of the residents. To examine the spatial characteristics of pollutant concentrations over Athens for each synoptic type, the synoptic circulation types were then correlated with both gaseous and <b>particulate</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentrations measured in each sector between 1983 and 1999.
