60|$|Indeed I {{had little}} {{time to talk with}} Bes about such light matters, since things moved apace in Memphis. Within six days all the great lords left in Upper Egypt were sworn to the revolt under the {{leadership}} of Peroa, and hour by hour their vassals or hired mercenaries flowed into the city. These it was my duty to weld into an army, and at this task I toiled without cease, separating them into regiments and drilling them, also arranging for the arming and victualling of the boats of war. Then news came that Idernes was advancing from Sais with a great force of Easterns, all the garrison of Lower Egypt indeed, as his messengers said, to answer the summons conveyed to him under the <b>private</b> <b>Seal</b> of seals.|$|E
60|$|And {{the next}} half-hour plunged M. le Duc into a perfect {{labyrinth}} of surmises, conjectures, doubts and fears. That Gaston de Stainville was possessed not only of full knowledge {{with regard to the}} Stuart prince's hiding-place, but also of a letter in Lydie's handwriting, addressed to the prince and sealed with her <b>private</b> <b>seal,</b> was sufficiently astonishing in itself, but the young man's thinly veiled innuendoes, his fatuous smiles, his obvious triumph, literally staggered M. le Duc, even though his palm itched with longing for contact with the insolent braggart's cheek. Every one of his beliefs was being forcibly uprooted; his daughter whom he had thought so unapproachable, so pure and so loyal! who had this very morning shamed him by her indignation at the very thought of this treachery, which she now so completely condoned! that she should have renounced her opinions, her enthusiasm {{for the sake of a}} man who had already betrayed her once, was more than M. le Duc could and would believe at first.|$|E

50|$|Scholars seem {{to agree}} on the {{typology}} and purpose of bullae in both civil and domestic environments. The bullae for the administration were generally un-iconic and exclusively epigraphic. It gave the names of administrative provinces and the titles of offices such as those of finance and justice. On the other hand, those bullae used for royals and important functionaries generally bear the owner’s bust accompanied by an inscription giving the name and title. <b>Private</b> <b>seals</b> and impressions, distinguished by a single motif sometimes accompanied by an inscription, provide a rich variety of iconographic patterns, largely reflecting the contemporary cultural and religious traditions of Iran, though only indirectly explained by the inscriptions accompany them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{head of a}} Zhou or Qin seal {{is often}} a bar, handle/stem, tile, or ring shape. During these periods, seals were {{normally}} official and used in government business. The material to make a seal was normally a metal such as bronze, copper, or iron, because durable metals were considered as [...] "immortal", which could represent {{the authority of the}} rule or government. <b>Private</b> <b>seals</b> were not so commonly seen and were mainly for very high ranking officials and nobles, as well as the Emperor. The head of the seal, called niu (鈕/钮), rarely had artistic elements. Its use was just for convenience in handling the seal, such as a ring to hang the seal from a belt by means of a cord.|$|R
6000|$|Not {{to dwell}} on Charles's earlier dalliances with Rome, in November 1665, his kinsman, Ludovick Stewart, Sieur d'Aubigny, of the Scoto- French Lennox Stewarts, was made a cardinal, and then died. Charles had now no man whom he could implicitly trust {{in his efforts to}} become formally, but secretly, a Catholic. And now James de la Cloche comes on the scene. Father Boero publishes, from the Jesuit archives, a strange paper, {{purporting}} to be written and signed by the King's hand, and sealed with his <b>private</b> <b>seal,</b> that diamond seal, whereof the impression brought such joy to the soul of the disgraced Archbishop Sharp. Father Boero attests the authenticity of seal and handwriting. In this paper, Charles acknowledges his paternity of James Stuart, 'who, by our command, has hitherto lived in France and other countries under a feigned name.' He has come to London, and is to bear the name of 'de la Cloche du Bourg de Jarsey.' De la Cloche is not to produce this document, 'written in his own language' (French), till after the King's death. (It {{is important to note that}} James de la Cloche seems to have spoken no language except French.) The paper is dated 'Whitehall, September 27, 1665,' when, as Lord Acton observes, the Court, during the Plague, was NOT at Whitehall.* ...|$|E
60|$|But King Henry was {{not half}} {{recovered}} from a heavy feverish cold, which he had not confessed or attended to, and he had also of late been troubled with a swelling of the neck. This morning, too, much to his inconvenience and dismay, he had missed his signet-ring. The <b>private</b> <b>seal</b> on such a ring was of more importance than the autograph at that time, and it would never have left the King's hand; but no doubt, in consequence of his indisposition, his finger, always small-boned, had become thin enough to allow the signet to escape unawares, he was unwilling to publish the loss, as it might {{cast doubt on the}} papers he despatched, and he, with his chamberlain Fitzhugh, King James, Malcolm, Percy, and a few more, had spent half the morning in the vain search, ending by the King sending his chamberlain, Lord Fitzhugh, to carry to Paris a seal already bearing his shield, but lacking the small private mark that authenticated it as his signet. Fitzhugh would stand over the lapidary and see this added, and bring it back. Ralf Percy had meantime been sent to bring a report of the diggers, but he was long in returning; and when Henry became uneasy, James had volunteered to go himself, and Henry had consented, not because the air was full of sleety rain or snow, but because his hands were full of letters needing to be despatched to all quarters.|$|E

50|$|Bumerke (plural: bumerker), rarely spelled bomerke, are house marks {{with some}} {{relations}} to coats of arms, {{as they were}} frequently used instead of arms, often displayed within an escutcheon or a shield. House marks were used for several purposes and like coats of arms, they were often used on <b>private</b> <b>seals</b> and signet rings. Coats of arms consist of coloured fields whilst house marks consist of simple lines only, suitable for carving on e.g. wooden utensils. They are renditions of very simple runic-like letters and other graphic symbols which signify a specific person or family. They may be passed down through generations with some changes from person to person. This custom has mostly died out. Before literacy became widespread, a bumerke would often be used instead of a signature.|$|R
2500|$|The Pribilofs, {{named after}} the Russian navigator, Gavriil Pribylov, were {{discovered}} in 1786 by Russian fur traders; no Alaska Natives {{are known to have}} lived on the island prior to this point. They landed first on St. George and named the larger island to the north St. Peter and St. Paul Island. In 1788, the Russian-American Company enslaved and relocated Aleuts from [...] Atka and Unalaska to the Pribilofs to hunt fur seals; their descendants live on the two islands today. In 1870, the now-American owned Alaska Commercial Company (formerly the Russian-American Company) was awarded a 20-year sealing lease by the U.S. Government, and provided housing, food and medical care to the Aleuts in exchange for seal harvesting. In 1890, a second 20-year lease was awarded to the North American Commercial Company, however, the fur seals had been severely over-harvested and only an estimated 200,000 fur seals remained. The 1910 Fur <b>Seal</b> Treaty ended <b>private</b> <b>sealing</b> on the islands and placed the community and fur seals under the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. Food and clothing were scarce, social and racial segregation were practiced, and working conditions were poor.|$|R

5000|$|In December 1922, {{under the}} Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 a {{separate}} Great Seal of Northern Ireland was created. The letters patent appointing the first Governor of Northern Ireland {{allowed him to}} use his <b>private</b> <b>seal</b> until the Great Seal was ready. Although the Constitution of the Irish Free State did not mention any seal, the letters patent appointing its first Governor-General mandated its use, with similar interim provision for a <b>private</b> <b>seal.</b> The Great Seal of the Irish Free State was delivered in 1925 to a design agreed by the Executive Council. As in other Dominions of the then British Commonwealth, the Great Seal of the Realm was used for some diplomatic functions. In 1931, a separate [...] "External Great Seal" [...] was struck to replace the Great Seal of the Realm in these functions. Under the 1937 Constitution of Ireland, the Seal of the President of Ireland replaced the internal Free State seal, but the External Great Seal remained in use, until the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 came into force.|$|E

5000|$|As papyrus and {{parchment}} gradually replaced clay tablets, bullae {{became the}} new encasement for scrolls {{of this new}} writing style. Documents were split into two halves, separated in the middle by multiple perforations. The top half was rolled into a scroll and a cord would wrap this section tight, going through the perforations. Clay was impressed on the cord to avoid unauthorized reading and {{the bottom of the}} document was then wrapped around the initial scroll. Bullae found in dig sites that appear concave and smooth and unmarked are thus these initial molds of clay placed around the interior scroll. A new cord was introduced around the document and a bullae attached {{to the ends of the}} cord, on the knot of the cord, or around the cord in its entirety, forming a ring. These outer rings could not guarantee unauthorized access to the documents as one could simply slip out the parchment and replace the bullae [...] "ring" [...] with one of their choosing. Designs were inscribed on the clay seals to mark ownership, identify witnesses or partners in commerce, or control of government officials. The later “official” seals were usually larger than <b>private</b> <b>seals</b> and could be designated seals of office, with inscriptions only identifying the office. In many cases, fingerprints of the person who made the impression remain visible near the border of the seal in the clay. Various forms of bullae have been found in archeological digs.|$|R

5000|$|One of the {{developments}} which Henry VII and the Tudor Reconquest of Ireland sought to reverse {{was that the}} Lord Deputy's <b>private</b> <b>seal,</b> kept by his secretary, was being used {{in place of the}} Great Seal of Ireland. In 1638, Lord Chancellor Adam Loftus refused to kneel before Lord Deputy Thomas Wentworth when delivering the Great Seal to him, contributing to the breakdown in their relationship. [...] In 1662, the fee to the Lord Chancellor for patents under the Great Seal was increased to 10 shillings sterling per patentee.
