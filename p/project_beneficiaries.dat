40|$|Reducing {{hunger and}} poverty {{requires}} effective strategies but many traditional {{monitoring and evaluation}} methods are costly, complicated, rigid, slow, and {{do not include the}} opinions of the <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> The 5 Q approach is simple, adaptable, responsive, effective, and better integrates stakeholders. <b>Project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> can proactively participate in programs for greater livelihood, health, and environmental gains. Developed in cooperation with CIAT. The 5 Q approach aims to simplify monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) methods, in order to improve transparency, mutual accountability, and the effectiveness of research and development projects. The fast, easy-to-use, and cost-effective approach offers something that traditional MEL methods don’t: project implementers receive quick feedback on their project in order to make adjustments during the project cycle. <b>Project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> can proactively participate in programs that directly impact their lives, including throughout the project design, implementation, and evaluation processes, in order to have their needs better understood and met. The 5 Q approach asks just 5 simple questions at regular intervals to each one of a project’s stakeholder groups (e. g., farmers, project implementers, and donors) and rapidly analyzes their answers to assess if the project is on track, and if not, adapt quickly. Answers are collected through a means best suited to each group, such as face-to-face surveys, mobile phone apps, web apps, and participatory video. Responses are automatically stored in a central database, processed, and disseminated through an online dashboard to visualize changes – for example in knowledge, attitude, skills, and practices – throughout the project cycle...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Sociology and Social Anthropology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. Cape Town’s {{growing economy}} has benefited greatly from its natural resources. The city boasts the unique Table Mountain; Blue Flag beaches; and the {{distinctive}} fynbos of the Cape Floral Kingdom, {{all of which}} have contributed considerably to the revenue generated by the tourism industry. Even though the city’s economy appears robust, many people living in townships on the Cape Flats continue to face a reality of being trapped in a state of deprivation; unable to access those natural resources as a means to make a living; and unable to cope with shocks, trends and seasonality in a dynamic, vulnerable society plagued by inequitable distribution of wealth and environmental degradation. Yet, while access to financial, natural (and other) assets is limited, poor people can rely upon their social assets – or Social Capital (SC) {{in order to make a}} living. This case study explores the three types of Social Capital – (i) Bonding SC (between <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries),</b> (ii) Bridging SC (between <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> and implementing agents) and (iii) Linking SC (between implementing agents and local government organs) – in an attempt to understand their impact on the livelihoods of <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> involved in the Khayelitsha-based Siyazama Community Allotment Gardening Association (SCAGA). This was done with the purpose of enabling development practitioners, government officials and local people to work together to plan sustainable initiatives that enhance peoples’ quality of life. Although case studies have been criticised by some authors as lacking scientific rigor and do not address generalisability, this study employed a case study approach due to its appropriateness when dealing with a small number of participants and the specific context of their complex real-life activities in great depth. By taking a post-positivistic stance, the researcher was able to appreciate the different constructions and meanings that people place upon their life experiences...|$|E

40|$|Developmental aid is {{provided}} by developed nations to governments {{in the third world}} for specific reasons. Reasons for this kind of aid could be humanitarian, charitable, and what is called systematic. Some of the aid is channeled or provided through church or faith-based communities. One of such faith based institutions that received developmental aid is Catholic Development Commission in Malawi (CADECOM). For this study CADECOM has been selected due to the advantages of accessibility and quantum of aid received annually. The aim of the research study was to investigate the impact of developmental aid on the targeted beneficiaries of Njolo irrigation scheme, a project carried out by CADECOM. The researcher intended to achieve three objectives; a) to explore how Njolo irrigation scheme project was initiated, designed and implemented; b) to explore the challenges encountered during the implementation of Njolo irrigation scheme projects; c) to investigate the impact of developmental aid through Njolo irrigation scheme on the <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> and the promotion of human values as stipulated by Dedza Diocese. There are notable indications in the literature review that seem to suggest that aid has not made much impact in Africa especially in the sub Saharan region. The reasons vary, but one of it is lack of the transfer of the technical skills from the donor partner to the beneficiary of the aid. For the design of the research study the author applied epistemology type of philosophy which leans heavily on positivism because of the existing facts of Njolo irrigation scheme. On the basis of the approaches, the author applied qualitative research mainly, though quantitative element can be detected. The study revealed the following: •	The Njolo irrigation scheme was initiated by the community; hence it was a demand –driven project. •	To a larger extent, the stages in the project cycle that is project initiation, designing and planning, execution, and monitoring were done to satisfactory levels. •	During the implementation of the project, {{there were a number of}} challenges that were encountered by both the implementers and <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> •	The project registered some impacts on the socio-economic welfare of the target beneficiaries. Such impact included: The beneficiaries became more food secure than before. •	To a great extent, the project managed to promote the human values as stipulated by the Diocese of Dedza. •	 Overall, factors that affected the attainment of the intended project impact included inadequate funding, insignificant number of <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> lack of market to sell the extra produce from the scheme, time span for the project and non-holistic approach to addressing the needs of the target community. Based on the revelations from the study, the researcher recommends that: •	There is need to increase the time frame for such projects •	There is need to increasing number of <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> in such projects in order to realize meaning impact •	There is need to secure adequate funding for project implementation •	There is need to be equipping the <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> with technical skills to ensure suitability of technical support. •	In such projects, the <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> should be involved through the entire project cycle •	Project planning should include an exist plan. The exist plan shall be a kind of agreement with the donor partners that when a project duration expires, there must be an allowance of a certain period where the donor still provides support that may be needed be it technical, financial. The researcher suggests this because Malawi is a third World country where learning doing new things takes a gradual process. For future research, a study that targets significantly a larger group would be necessary. Further to that there is a need to make comparative study with a group that has not received any donor support to find out how they survive...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the monitoring {{mechanism of the}} SEAFDEC/AQD Community-based Fisheries Resources Management (CFRM) Project at Malalison Island in west central Philippines. The objective {{of the project was}} to learn from the collaboration of community organizations, biologists, and social scientists in adapting aquaculture and fishery management techniques and to assess the replicability of the experience to other fishing communities. The monitoring mechanism used was Process Documentation Research (PDR), a way of recording the development process of a project focusing on the participatory model of the resource management strategy. A full-time, site-based process documentator gathered information. All activities, meetings, and consultations were tape-recorded. Informal talks or encounters with the people were also recorded. The paper showed that PDR provided a better understanding and insight on the positive and negative perceptions of the <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> on the CFRM project.

40|$|M. Ed. Monitoring and {{evaluation}} {{are some of}} the important aspects towards the attainment of sustainability in projects. Besides this women are empowered through their active participation in such processes. This study seeks to indicate that whenever <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> are fully involved in all aspects of the project management cycle a greater likelihood exist for the success of the project. It also shows how collective action can help in the development of communities. The findings of this essay can serve as a watershed for the promotion of dialogue within the project community. There are certain implications of these findings, which are indicative of the importance of community networking, community meetings and community involvement. This study is an endeavour to dispel the notion that evaluation as perceived by traditional evaluators is a field of "experts". In other words, for a person to take part in meaningful evaluation venture, he or she needs certain recognised academic regalia. With capacity building mechanisms in place even a person who may not necessarily be highly literate can monitor and evaluate projects. These women, some of them cannot read and write, but they can monitor and evaluate their projects. This also brings another important aspect into play, concerning their engagement in community meetings and their project meetings, which really empower them. Participatory approaches that are employed at the project site thus contribute in making <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> aware of the "pockets of excellence" they possess. Besides that, the inclusivity and transparent operations involved in these processes makes women to practise collective decision-making. The levels of literacy amongst <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> do not serve as an obstacle in embracing participatory monitoring {{and evaluation}}.

This programme provides funding for projects that are initiated by or intended to benefit the poor and unemployed people. From the latter statement, for the Gauteng Department of Social Services and Population Development (GDSSPD) to make an informed decision-making on reducing poverty in Gauteng, and for monitoring poverty alleviation projects when policies are implemented, risk management plan is essential for projects to be sustainable and successful. The main challenge faced by the GDSSPD officials and <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> was to have risk management mechanism in place before projects could be funded and implemented. The aim of the study was therefore, to determine whether officials in the GDSSPD and the <b>project</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> who are involved in the operation of poverty alleviation projects on a daily basis were able to use their risk management strategy when they were planning for the implementation of poverty alleviation projects.

The paper {{is based on a}} combined quantitative-qualitative evaluation of a competitive publicly funded research program, known as “Mobilizing Programs”, in Belgium in the period 2002 - 2011. Projects funded by the Programs aim to direct university research towards potential business applications in the medium term. The unit of analysis is the <b>project</b> <b>beneficiary</b> and research cooperation is an explicit prerequisite for obtaining public funding. The novelty of the paper lies in the combination of a refined setting of breadth, composition and depth of research networks at project level.
