40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} commodity price stabilization on <b>producers</b> <b>and</b> consumers, both in the short run, {{and in the long}} run, when producers have adjusted their production decisions to take account of the change in the price distribution. We derive conditions under which (a) both <b>producers</b> <b>and</b> consumers may be better off; <b>and</b> (b) both <b>producers</b> <b>and</b> consumers may be worse off. Moreover, we show that the long-run effects may differ not only quantitatively but also qualitatively from the short-run effects.

40|$|This master thesis aims to {{identify}} the production processes within the contemporary creative industries, and in particular one field of culture and media production called transmedia. This thesis focuses on one particular aspect of transmedia – interactivity and participation. The questions that are investigated are: How does transmedia producers use interactivity? Does transmedia and interactivity change the production conditions for <b>producers,</b> <b>and</b> if so, how and why? The aim of this thesis is to get {{an understanding of the}} working conditions within the context of transmedia for <b>producers</b> <b>and</b> in extension for the consumers. Through this, the intention is also to create {{a better understanding of the}} role of transmedia within the contemporary creative industries. The methods used to examine this are based on qualitative research interviews with six transmedia <b>producers</b> <b>and</b> participatory observations of the documentary film project Ghost Rockets. By using a theoretical framework based on interactivity, participation, Marxist theories and Critical Theory this thesis comes to the conclusion that transmedia producers strive for interactivity but that full interactivity rarely is achieved. The use of interactivity and transmedia also leads to changing working conditions for both <b>producers</b> <b>and</b> consumers. These changes include a blurring of the roles of <b>producers</b> <b>and</b> consumers <b>and</b> that both <b>producers</b> <b>and</b> consumers are working for free...|$|R
