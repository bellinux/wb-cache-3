25|$|Return of the Jedi {{features}} a second Death Star still {{under construction in}} orbit around the second moon of Endor. Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader send the Rebels false information that the station's weapons systems are not operational in order to lure them into a trap. The station's main weapon was a dramatic improvement over its predecessor: while the first Death Star fired only once every 24 hours, the second fired once every 3 minutes, and its multi-targeting systems was capable of destroying at least two capital ships per shot. When the station's protective shield is disabled by a ground assault team on the forest moon of the planet Endor (led by Han Solo) {{with the help of}} the native Ewoks, rebel fighters flew into the unfinished station targeting its reactor core chamber and damaged the reactor core itself, which eventually explodes and destroys the station. It was destroyed by Wedge Antilles and Lando Calrissian (with Nien Nunb as his Millennium Falcon co-pilot), the former destroying a <b>power</b> <b>regulator</b> and the latter destroying the main reactor.|$|E

There was an unnoticeable buzz that you could hear if you turned on the backlight and placed the Palm next to your ear. This was due to the <b>power</b> <b>regulator</b> sending lots of power to the screen to power the backlight. Therefore, this caused the battery to drain faster than normal.|$|E

As the data bus was effectively reduced to 32-bit width, per-clock performance was much {{lower than that of}} a 'regular' Pentium, though still substantially faster compared to a similarly-clocked 486 owing to the Pentium's architectural improvements, such as the much improved FPU.

5000|$|These are {{the first}} series of modules made with the ESP8266 by the {{third-party}} manufacturer AI-Thinker and remain the most widely available. They are collectively referred to as [...] "ESP-xx modules". To form a workable development system they require additional components, especially a serial TTL-to-USB adapter (sometimes called a USB-to-UART bridge) and an external 3.3 volt power supply. Novice ESP8266 developers are encouraged to consider larger ESP8266 Wi-Fi development boards like the NodeMCU which includes the USB-to-UART bridge and a Micro-USB connector coupled with a 3.3 volt <b>power</b> <b>regulator</b> already built into the board.

The obtained results of experimental researches of turbine emergency control of generator demonstrate high accuracy of the simulator and possibility of real-time simulation of all the processes in the electric power system without any decomposition and limitation on their duration, and the effectiveness of the proposed simulator in solving of the design, operational and research tasks of electric power system...|$|R

Therefore, this process reconfigures the IFFT module and reduces its size. This leads to reducing the power consumption of the system. The operation takes 1.48 ms and all the precedent modules are suspended during the partial bit-stream transfer operation {{in order to avoid}} any data loss.|$|R

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tasked a committee comprising Abdul Qadir Baloch, a retired General of the Pakistan Army and Minister for States and Frontier Regions, together with State Minister for Health Sciences Regulation and Coordination Saira Afzal Tarar. The two Ministers visited Karachi's Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre {{in the wake of}} deaths due to the severe heat wave. Speaking to the media during their visit, Baloch said that the K-Electric was being investigated for load shedding. Baloch held the K-Electric, KW&SB and Sindh government responsible for the increase in heat wave mortality in Karachi.

50|$|The {{power system}} {{supplies}} and controls the required voltage levels and current essential for satellite operation during its mission. The power system uses a rechargeable Li-ion battery to provide {{power for the}} satellite’s payload and other subsystems. The system {{is divided into two}} stages, first is the charging stage and the second is the discharging stage.The charging stage is made of a solar power generator and <b>power</b> <b>regulator.</b> DubaiSat-2 generates more than 450W of power using four solar panels. Each solar panel contains 6 arrays and each array consists of 26 cells. The solar panels charge the batteries. The battery charging process is handled and regulated by the Battery Charging Regulators modules. DubaiSat-2 has three battery charging regulators with hot redundancy configuration which seamlessly take over if the primary battery charging regulator fails. The spacecraft can function normally with only two battery charging regulators.|$|E
5000|$|Electric kilns have {{controllers}} with {{a variety}} of sophistication: the simplest is the [...] "Infinity Control", a simple open-loop <b>power</b> <b>regulator.</b> As this only controls power, rather than temperature, such a kiln must be manually controlled throughout the cycle. As firing cycles extend over several hours, potentially days for large architectural pieces, automatic unattended control is obviously important. Automatic temperature control uses a PID controller that maintains a constant set temperature. More sophisticated controllers allow the ramp heating and cooling rates to be controlled too, an important factor in glass heating. Controllers dedicated for glass kiln use have their entire heating cycles defined before use with multiple set temperatures, hold times and ramps between them. The most sophisiticated controllers of all are dedicated to glass use and allow pre-defined cycles such as [...] "Fuse" [...] or [...] "Slump" [...] to be selected from a simple menu, without their operator needing {{to be aware of the}} precise temperatures required.|$|E

50|$|The typical 500 volts {{between the}} {{backside}} of the last MCP and the anode cannot be fed into the preamplifier. Therefore, the inner or the outer conductor needs a DC-block, that is, a capacitor. Often it is chosen to only have 10-fold capacitance compared to the MCP-anode capacitance and is implemented as a plate capacitor. Rounded, electro-polished metal plates and the ultra high vacuum allow very high field strengths and high capacitance without a dielectric. The bias for the center conductor is applied via resistors hanging through the waveguide (see bias tee). If the DC block {{is used in the}} outer conductor, it is in parallel with the larger capacitor in the power supply. Assuming good screening, the only noise is due to current noise from the linear <b>power</b> <b>regulator.</b> Because the current is low in this application and space for large capacitors is available, and because the DC-block capacitor is fast, it is possible to have very low voltage noise, so that even weak MCP signals can be detected. Sometimes the preamplifier is on a potential (off ground) and gets its power through a low-power isolation transformer and outputs its signal optically.|$|E
