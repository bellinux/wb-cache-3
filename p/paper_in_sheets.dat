40|$|The paper {{underlines the}} {{importance}} {{to apply a}} methodology that integrates the Building Information Modeling (BIM), Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and the Laser Scanner tool in conservation and reuse projects. As it is known, the laser scanner technology provides {{a survey of the}} building object which is more accurate rather than that carried out using traditional methodologies. Today most existing buildings present their attributes in a dispersed way, stored and collected <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> documents, <b>in</b> <b>sheets</b> of equipment information, in file folders of maintenance records. In some cases, it is difficult to find updated technical documentation and the research of reliable data can be a cost and time-consuming process. Therefore, this new survey technology, embedded with BIM systems represents a valid tool to obtain a coherent picture of the building state. The following case consists in the conservation and reuse project of Milan Lyric Theatre, started in 2013 from the collaboration between the Milan Polytechnic and the Municipality. This project first attempts to integrate these new techniques which are already professional standards in many other countries such as the US, Norway, Finland, England and so on. Concerning the methodology, the choice has been to use BIM software for the structured analysis of the project, with the aim to define a single code of communication to develop a coherent documentation according to rules in a consistent manner and in tight schedules. This process provides the definition of an effective and efficient operating method that can be applied to other projects...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} changes {{not only of}} the temperature profile, but also of the moisture profile of <b>paper</b> <b>in</b> a drying process is established. Thin electrodes on which is laden high-frequency voltage are inserted between paper sheets, and the impedance between the electrodes is measured in order to evaluate the moisture profile. Also thin thermocouples are inserted between the <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> <b>in</b> order to measure the temperature profile. A moist paper to be dried is attached to a hot roll on one side, and a canvas is attached to that on the other side in which hot air flows. The change of temperature profile and that of moisture profile in this drying process are measured at the same time. The temperature of the roll side of the paper increases more rapidly than that of the canvas side and the paper moisture of the roll side decreases more rapidly than that of the canvas side. As a result, it is confirmed {{that it is necessary to}} deal with a paper sheet as a porous material to accurately predict its drying process...|$|R

These legs were of such a length as to make the desk just high enough for Marco. James put it down, at Forester's direction, near the window. It was placed with the left side toward the window, so that the light from the window would strike across the desk from left to right. This is the most convenient direction for receiving light when one is writing.

The improvement of the paper mechanical properties as well as the decrease in the optical properties are explained by the better bonding between the hydroxyl groups of the silica attached to the PCC particles and those of the cellulosic fibres.

Such temperature may subsequently alter the mechanical properties of stressed solids, and finally facilitate their rupture. Thermal runaway weakening processes could indeed explain stick-slip motions and even be responsible for deep earthquakes. Therefore, to better understand catastrophic rupture events, it appears crucial to establish an accurate energy budget of fracture propagation from a clear measure of the various energy dissipation sources. In this work, combining analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we directly relate the temperature field around a moving crack tip to the part α of mechanical energy converted into heat. Monitoring the slow crack growth <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> with an infrared camera, we measure a significant fraction α = 12 % ± 4 %.

40|$|The average lateral {{dimensions}} of cellulose microfibrils <b>in</b> <b>paper</b> <b>sheets</b> {{can be determined}} from the width of X-ray Bragg peaks at half the maximum height. The method assumes it is the finite size of the crystallite which is the main contributor to peak broadening in the directions orthogonal to the long axis of the crystallite. The assumption is examined {{in the context of}} samples from different botanical sources, of varying crystallinity and cellulose content and the various instrumental sources of broadening X-ray powder patterns. Excellent fits to the data from paper samples can be obtained by using five Voigt functions to the powder diffraction patterns, for the 01, 101, 021, 002 and 040 reflections. Of these reflections, the 020 is the clearest, and the best able to determine the lateral dimension of the crystallite.
