40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a survey of email users in different regions of Saudi Arabia about email SPAM. The survey investigated the nature of email SPAM, how email users in the eastern, western, central, southern and northern dealt with it, and the efforts made to combat it. It also investigated the effectiveness of existing Anti-SPAM filters in detecting Arabic and English email SPAM. 1, 500 <b>participants</b> located <b>in</b> the eastern, western, central, southern and northern regions of Saudi Arabia were surveyed and completed surveys were collected from 1, 020 of the participants. The results showed that there were different definitions for email SPAM based on different usersâ€™ opinions in Saudi Arabia. The results showed that the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the central and western regions were more aware of SPAM than the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> other regions. The results revealed that the volume of email SPAM was different from region to another and the volume of SPAM received by the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the northern and central regions was larger than that received in other regions. The results indicated that the majority of email SPAM received by the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> different regions was written in English. The results showed that {{the most common type of}} email SPAM received in Arabic was emails related to forums and in English was phishing and fraud, and business advertisements. The results also showed that a few <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> all regions responded to SPAM and the average of the participants who responded to SPAM was larger in the southern region than other regions. The results showed that most of the participants were not aware of Anti-SPAM programs and the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the central region were more aware of Anti-SPAM programs than the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> other regions. The results showed that the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> all regions estimated that the existing Anti-SPAM programs were more effective in detecting English SPAM than Arabic SPAM. The results showed that most of the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> all regions were not aware of the government efforts to combat SPAM and the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the central region were more aware of the government efforts than the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> other regions. The results also showed that most of the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> all regions were not aware of the ISPs efforts to combat SPAM and the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the central and western regions were more aware of the ISPs efforts than the <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> other regions...|$|R

40|$|Individuals {{with autism}} {{spectrum}} disorders (ASDs) {{have been known}} to struggle with attaining and maintaining employment. The stigma of ASDs plays a large role in this struggle, and research on stigma management strategies in the workplace is needed. I investigated the effects of two specific stigma management strategies for adults with ASD in the workplace, self-disclosure and interpersonal warmth behaviors (e. g., asking others questions about their interests), on coworker attitudes. In this experiment, I showed participants a video of an individual with ASD interacting with coworkers. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four conditions, featuring 1) the presence or absence of self-disclosure and 2) the presence or absence of interpersonal warmth from an individual with ASD. Participants then completed questionnaires to capture several dimensions of their attitudes. Results showed that <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the disclosure condition perceived more warmth and competence, felt more admiration and less irritation, and had greater intentions to help and associate than <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the no disclosure condition. <b>Participants</b> <b>in</b> the disclosure condition also reported more willingness to work with an individual with ASD than <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the no disclosure condition. <b>Participants</b> <b>in</b> the warmth present condition reported seeing the individual as significantly warmer than <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the warmth behaviors absent condition. <b>Participants</b> <b>in</b> the warmth behaviors present condition also reported feeling significantly less envy towards the individual in the warmth behaviors present condition than <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> the warmth behaviors absent condition...|$|R
