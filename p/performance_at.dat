40|$|In {{input-output}} analysis many definitions of {{direct and indirect}} requirements are used. This paper argues that the definition of indirect input requirements used by the U. S.

The paper also identifies the conditions to be met in order to compare <b>performances</b> <b>at</b> system level and the <b>performances</b> <b>at</b> industry levels. Finally {{it shows that the}} difference between <b>performances</b> <b>at</b> system level and <b>performances</b> <b>at</b> industry level is explained simply by their different product-mixes...|$|R
