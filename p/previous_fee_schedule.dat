40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide {{estimates}} of the costs of basing Medicaid physician payment levels on the new resource-based Medicare <b>Fee</b> <b>Schedule.</b> Two possible policy options are considered: setting all Medicaid physician fees at the Medicare <b>Fee</b> <b>Schedule</b> level and setting only office visit fees at the new Medicare levels. METHODS. Data on Medicaid physician fees, use patterns, and the Medicare <b>Fee</b> <b>Schedule</b> are used to develop state-level estimates of expenditure changes under each option. RESULTS. Setting Medicaid rates at the Medicare <b>Fee</b> <b>Schedule</b> level could increase expenditures by $ 3. 2 to $ 4. 1 billion nationally; the other option would result in substantially lower increases in expenditures. Because of the current variations in Medicaid physician fees and in the breadth of eligibility across states, the cost of adopting the Medicare <b>Fee</b> <b>Schedule</b> varies considerably among states. CONCLUSIONS. Adopting the new Medicare <b>Fee</b> <b>Schedule</b> for Medicaid payments, proposed by policy-makers as a way to increase access to appropriate medical care, could double physician expenditures in some states. Adoption of more limited versions of the <b>fee</b> <b>schedule</b> might achieve some access gains at lower costs...|$|R

We also discuss the optimal rule of this <b>fee</b> <b>schedule</b> for the regulator, taking into account information asymmetry between the regulator and providers. Our simple model predicts that under the current <b>fee</b> <b>schedule</b> heterogeneous providers either under-provide or over-provide medical inputs, depending on the price. Furthermore, our analytical results show that when the allocated budget is reduced to a certain level, even the second-best outcome becomes unachievable, no matter how the <b>fee</b> <b>schedule</b> is regulated. While we demonstrate that the global budget caps or the limited budget size is shown to have a clear negative effect on social welfare, we suggest that the prospect of obtaining the second-best outcome without complete information on heterogeneous providers is left to negotiation between the regulator and the budget allocator...|$|R
