40|$|The {{high energy}} {{emission}} of microquasars {{is thought to}} originate from high energy particles. Depending on the spectral state, the distribution of these particles can be thermal with a high temperature (typically 100 keV) or non-thermal and extending to even higher energy. The properties of high energy plasmas are governed by a rich microphysics involving particle-particle collisions and particles-photons interactions. We present a new code developed to address the evolution of relativistic plasmas. This one-zone code focuses on the microphysics and solves the coupled kinetic equations for particles and photons, including Compton scattering, synchrotron emission and absorption, pair production and annihilation, bremsstrahlung emission and absorption, Coulomb interactions, and prescriptions for additional particle acceleration and heating. It can in particular describe mechanisms such a thermalisation by synchrotron self-absorption and Coulomb collisions. Using the code, we investigate whether various acceleration processes, namely thermal heating, non-thermal acceleration and stochastic acceleration, can reproduce the different spectral states of microquasars. <b>Premilinary</b> results are presented.

40|$|International audienceThe {{emplacement}} of LCT-type pegmatite {{field is}} recently admitted {{to be controlled}} by regional tectonic structures rather than by the proximity to a granitic body. In particular, the emplacement of Monts d'Ambazac pegmatites (France), which is controlled by an oriented faults-system. In order to strenghten these findings, we investigated two pegmatite fields which present similar mineralizations, but different spatial organizations: the Forcarei pegmatite field (FPF,Spain) and The Barroso-Avão pegmatite field (BAPF, Portugal). The FPF is limited in its southern edge by the Celanova migmatitic dome (CMD), where some pegmatites occurred. These observations favor a priori the model of direct crustal anatexis (DCA). Moreover, geostatistics and syn-kinematic criteria as shear-bands that are observed in pegmatites seem to suggest that the left-lateral Serra do Suido shear-zone near to the FPF has a major role during its emplacement. Indeed, pegmatites are clustered and oriented in the same broad N-S direction as the shear-zone. The formation of BAPF also matches the DCA model since it is located near to the southern edge of the CMD. The distribution of pegmatites shows no preferred orientation and cross-cutting of pegmatite-subtypes. The lack of shear-zone in BAPF indicates the key role of such structures on the field zonation. These preliminary results favor the influence of shear-zones as flow channels on i) the variscan pegmatite fields emplacement and ii) pegmatite subtypes field-scale organization. These results have been enhanced by <b>premilinary</b> numerical model which investigates the ascent of pegmatitc melts through crustal-scale permeable zone...|$|E

Preliminary research results indicate that soybean yakults which stored at 35 oC in organoleptic can be stored for 48 hours, at temperature of 28 oC can be stored for 120 hours and at a temperature of 10 oCcan be stored for 240 hours. The main results of the research showed that soybean yakult which stored with Arrhenius method has a different shelf life based on acid total and bacteria total. Based on the acid total, soybean yakult shelf life at temperature 10 oC is 10 days, at temperature 28 oC is 3 days and at temperature 35 oC is 1, 5 days.
