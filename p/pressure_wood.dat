40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of a Monte Carlo approach for computing the configurational free energy of chains is described. Whereas {{the effectiveness of the}} previous Monte Carlo methods is limited to the systems in which the energies of the stares (configurations) are not far from zero, the present approach can yield accurate estimates of the free energy of the systems with large configurational energy. The method utilises the relationship: where AGM is the free energy difference between a pair of systems A and E and (M(UB- UA)) A is the canonical ensemble average of the Metropolis function over A, UA and U, being the energies of a stare (configuration) corresponding to A and E respectively. (M(UB- UA)) A is estimated from the configuration samples generated by a method described previously. Calculations of the free energy as a function of bond flexibility are performed for a chain of twenty bonds confined to a tetrahedral lattice. During the past two decades or so Monte Carlo methods have shown remarkable success in the computation of the ensemble means relating to such properties as configurational energy, configurational heat capacity and <b>pressure</b> (<b>Wood</b> 1968, La 1 1971).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the latest research}} project supported by the French research agency ANR regarding the bi-oleothermal treatment of wood at atmospheric <b>pressure.</b> <b>Wood</b> treatment by the "bi-oleothermal " process (combination of oil and heat treatment) is a well mastered alternative method for wood protection.

40|$|O objectivo deste trabalho foi verificar o efeito do pré-tratamento da madeira por alta pressão para o cozimento kraft. Foi também estudado o efeito desse mesmo prétratamento no branqueamento e nas propriedades físico-mecânicas das pastas celulósicas. Para se atingir este objectivo sujeitou-se aparas de Eucalyptus globulus a um prétratamento hiperbárico de 400 MPa durante 30 minutos, procedendo-se à secagem ao ar livre e ao cozimento kraft com diferentes tempos de cozimento. Foi realizado um estudo sequencial (cozimento, branqueamento e propriedades físico-mecânicas) para um tempo de cozimento de 210 min nas condições pré-definidas, ou seja alcali activo, A. A., de 15, 2 %, índice de sulfureto, I. S., de 30, 8 % e hidromódulo de 4 L/kg. O pré-tratamento hiperbárico melhorou a aptidão para o cozimento kraft. Os resultados demonstraram que a pasta obtida apresentava um rendimento {{inferior}} à pasta padrão, mas conseguia-se retirar uma maior quantidade de lenhina durante o cozimento kraft. Isso foi demonstrado pelo valor do índice kappa, IK, sendo o IK de 17, 9 para o cozimento padrão e de 16, 9 para o cozimento A. P. com pré-tratamento hiperbárico pois durante o cozimento a difusão dos reagentes é mais fácil bem como a difusão dos produtos de degradação. Os valores da viscosidade foram praticamente iguais nos dois tipos de amostra, padrão e pré-tratada por alta pressão. Quando a pasta foi sujeita ao primeiro estágio do branqueamento, o IK reduziu-se em ambas as pastas, IK de 12, 3 para a pasta padrão e 11, 6 para a pasta A. P. Quanto à viscosidade, esta diminuiu com o branqueamento em ambas as pastas, existindo assim uma degradação parcial da pasta. Quanto aos valores de OXE, equivalentes de oxidação, estes mantiveram-se praticamente iguais nas duas pastas, o que nos indica que o efeito da alta pressão não influenciou o branqueamento, pois não se reduziu a quantidade de reagentes de branqueamento, ficando a estrutura fibrilar inalterada. Em relação às propriedades físico-mecânicas, estas foram avaliadas sem refinação para os dois tipos de pasta. Verificou-se que a pasta obtida do cozimento sujeito a pré-tratamento hiperbárico apresentou melhorias em algumas propriedades mecânicas, nomeadamente o índice de rebentamento e a rigidez. Existiu uma diminuição do índice de mão, tornando as fibras mais moldáveis devido à quantidade de lenhina diminuir. Os valores não são conclusivos para se saber se a alta pressão afectou as propriedades físico-mecânicas da pasta. The aim of {{the current}} work was to study the effect of high <b>pressure</b> <b>wood</b> pretreatment, previous to the kraft pulping. The influence of this pre-treatment, on the bleaching and physic-mechanical properties on the pulp, were also target of study. In order to accomplish these purposes, Eucalyptus globulus chips suffered a 400 MPa high pressure pre-treatment, during 40 minutes. After this procedure the wood chips were dried and suffered a kraft pulping process, with different time ranges of cooking. Considering the sample subjected to a 210 minutes pulping process, under predefined conditions, such as, 15, 2 % active alkali 30, 8 % sulfidity and a 4 L/kg hydromodule a sequential study (kraft pulping, bleaching and physical and mechanical properties) was applied. The high pressure treatment improved the kraft cooking. The attained results for the pulping, with the wood high pressure pre-treatment, resulted in an inferior pulp yield, but with higher lignin removal, comparing with a standard sample. The improved lignin removal was proved by the kappa number. For the standard pulp, the achieved kappa number was 17, 9 whereas for the pulp affected by the wood high pressure pretreatment, the kappa number was 16, 9. This improvement on the kraft pulping made {{by means of the}} already referred pre-treatment, {{can be explained by the}} easier diffusion of the reactants and resulting byproducts, during the pulping process. The viscosity values attained for both pulping procedures, with and without pre-treatment, where the same. Concerning the first stage of bleaching, the kappa number decreased in both cases, with and without pre-treatment, the kappa number for the standard pulp was 12, 3, while the pulp with the pre-treatment yielded a 11, 6 kappa number. As regards viscosity, this one decreased in both pulps, with the bleaching process. A partial degradation of the pulp was verified. The OXE, oxidation equivalent, values were kept nearly alike in both cases, which means that the high pressure did not affected the bleaching, leaving the fiber structure unchanged. The physical and mechanical properties were analyzed without refining, in both cases. The pulp pre-treated with the high pressure procedure, presented some improvements in some of these properties, namely the burs and stiffness. The bulk decreased, hence rendering more malleable fiber, due to the lower amount of lignin in the pulp. The values from the physical and mechanical tests were not conclusive as regards the effect of high pressure on the pulp's physical and mechanical properties. Mestrado em Engenharia Químic...|$|E
30|$|A {{new method}} for {{monitoring}} moisture content during radio-frequency (RF)/vacuum drying {{was developed by}} measurement of temperature and <b>pressure</b> in <b>wood.</b> Temperature and <b>pressure</b> inside the <b>wood</b> were measured simultaneously during RF/vacuum drying at the same point.

When the moisture content was below the FSP, the calculated MC was slightly greater than the value given by oven drying.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the course}} of our studies, we have learned that solid wood has {{significant}} deformability characteristics under specific conditions, resulting from slippage occurring among wood cells when wood treated with small-molecular resins is compressed under heat. Furthermore, the deformed shapes obtained are maintained when the resin introduced into the wood cells is cured.

Successful molding conditions were achieved by varying the <b>pressure,</b> temperature and <b>wood</b> fiber direction for the extrusion ratio of 42. The mechanical properties of the wood plastic composite (WPC) sheets obtained by this extrusion process are affected by the fiber direction of the wood in the extrudate, which is almost equivalent to the longitudinal direction of the cellulose crystals of wood.

40|$|Purpose: Wood {{infiltrated}} with nano-silica hydrosol forms a “weak”, irregular {{composite of}} components bound with hydrogen bonds only. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the influence of low-energy ions bombardment on the structure and properties of the surface of this composite. The aim of these investigations was to produce a shallow “buried” layer of a dense wood-ceramic composite on a wood surface. Design/methodology/approach: D. c. glow-discharge in N 2 /H 2 (9 : 11) atmosphere under a pressure of 4 hPa was the source of ions. A beech plate was placed on the cathode. The temperature of wood was 200 °C. The material collected from the wood-silica composite surface was investigated with FTIR spectroscopy and SEM observations. The surface energy was determined with the use of contact angle measurements. Findings: The ions influenced silica only. The nano-particles underwent sintering changing its medium size twice and a small I. R. peak of N 2 trapped in SiO 2 suggest the possibility of silica nitriding. A buried, continual surface layer of sintered silica did not form. The surface energy of the “wood-silica” plate was slightly decreased after plasma treatment. Research limitations/implications: The results proved the possibility of plasma treatment of wood even in a d. c. glow-discharge under low pressure. Silica sintering, a difficult process which in a thermal way has to be carried out at a temperature of 1000 °C, taking place in a plasma at a temperature of 200 °C showed the very special nature of an influence of ions. Originality/value: The plasma surface treatment of wood in the d. c. glow-discharge (GD) under reduced pressure has not been investigated. There are only publications about glow-dielectric-barrier-discharge (GDBD) at atmospheric <b>pressure</b> applications for <b>wood</b> surface modification. The energy of ions in GDBD is much smaller than that of ions in GD and therefore the application of glow discharge under reduced <b>pressure</b> to <b>wood</b> surface treatment can be more efficient...|$|R
