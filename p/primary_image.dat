500|$|Falk soon {{proved himself}} to be a capable agent with many {{innovative}} marketing ideas. [...] He allowed Nike to establish Jordan's <b>primary</b> <b>image,</b> then began splitting it up among other advertisers, including Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Wilson Sporting Goods, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI. [...] Falk's ideas stretched to all areas of the marketplace, including a fragrance (called simply [...] "Michael Jordan") made by the Beverly Hills designer Bijan, which was cited as the best-marketed product of 1996 by the American Marketing Association. [...] Falk even {{came up with the idea}} of teaming Bugs Bunny and Jordan together in a feature film, and then sold the concept to Warner Bros. in 1993. [...] The ensuing film, Space Jam, was executive produced by Falk and released in 1996. [...] Perhaps most importantly, Falk [...] "set a precedent by 'opting out' Jordan from the league's licensing program, in effect reclaiming Jordan's image for his own use." [...] Jordan himself was very grateful for his agent's remarkable negotiating and marketing abilities, even with Falk's penchant for making powerful enemies along the way.|$|E
40|$|Large {{collections}} of {{images can be}} indexed by their projections on a few "primary" <b>images.</b> The optimal <b>primary</b> <b>images</b> are the eigenvectors of a large covariance matrix. We {{address the problem of}} computing <b>primary</b> <b>images</b> when access to the images is expensive. This is the case when the images cannot be kept locally, but must be accessed through slow communication such as the Internet, or stored in a compressed form. A distributed algorithm that computes optimal approximations to the eigenvectors (known as Ritz vectors) in one pass through the image set is proposed. When iterated, the algorithm can recover the exact eigenvectors. The widely used SVD technique for computing the <b>primary</b> <b>images</b> of a small image set is a special case of the proposed algorithm. In applications to image libraries and learning it is necessary to compute different <b>primary</b> <b>images</b> for several sub-categories of the image set.

500|$|... "Anarchy in the U.K." [...] was not {{the first}} British punk single, pipped by the Damned's [...] "New Rose". [...] "We Vibrate" [...] had also {{appeared}} from the Vibrators, a pub rock band formed early in 1976 that had become associated with punk—though, according to Jon Savage [...] "with their long hair and mildly risque name, the Vibrators were passers-by as far as punk taste-makers were concerned." [...] Unlike those songs, whose lyrical content was comfortably within rock 'n' roll traditions, [...] "Anarchy in the U.K." [...] linked punk to a newly politicised attitude—the Pistols' stance was aggrieved, euphoric and nihilistic, all at the same time. Rotten's howls of [...] "I am an anti-Christ" [...] and [...] "Destroy!" [...] repurposed rock as an ideological weapon. The single's packaging and visual promotion also broke new ground. Reid and McLaren came up with the notion of selling the record in a completely wordless, featureless black sleeve. The <b>primary</b> <b>image</b> associated with the single was Reid's [...] "anarchy flag" [...] poster: a Union Flag ripped up and partly safety-pinned back together, with the song and band names clipped along the edges of a gaping hole in the middle. This and other images created by Reid for the Sex Pistols quickly became punk icons.|$|E

2500|$|Assist {{features}} {{are often used}} to help balance asymmetry from non-telecentricity at different slit positions, due to different illumination angles, starting at the 7nm node. However, the asymmetry is reduced but not completely eliminated, since the assist features mainly enhance the highest spatial frequencies, whereas intermediate spatial frequencies, which also affect feature focus and position, are not much affected. The coupling between the <b>primary</b> <b>image</b> and the self images is too strong for the asymmetry to be completely eliminated by assist features; only asymmetric illumination can achieve this. Assist features may also {{get in the way}} of access to power/ground rails. Power rails are expected to be wider, which also limits the effectiveness of using assist features, by constraining the local pitch. Local pitches between 1x and 2x the minimum pitch forbid assist feature placement, as there is simply no room to preserve the local pitch symmetry. In fact, for the application to the two-bar asymmetry case, the optimum assist feature placement may be less than or exceed the two-bar pitch. Depending on the parameter to be optimized (process window area, depth of focus, exposure latitude), the optimum assist feature configuration can be very different, e.g., pitch between assist feature and bar being different from two-bar pitch, symmetric or asymmetric, etc..|$|E

40|$|Within {{the poetic}} creation, the culture-nature {{relation}} plays between the ontological {{structures of the}} imaginary and their particular way of being rendered in a literary work, i. e. style. The imaginary is manifest through <b>primary</b> <b>images</b> which we define as substitutive mental representations of reality. The poetic images {{are different from the}} <b>primary</b> <b>images</b> in that they are never punctual, but they fulfill themselves through combinations of first-degree images, combinations that are at least binary. Still, the ontological is not a sum of objects, but rather an infinity of relations established between these objects. The imaginary transfers relations from the objective world into its mental double through what we call imaginative relational schemes. We draw a distinction between external relational schemes, which are constituents of rhetorical devices, and external relational schemes, which are accountable for textual syntagmatics. In poetry, the dynamics of images and imaginative schemes is visible in style, which materializes them in the act of creation...|$|R
