40|$|The core {{principles}} of financial crisis management call upon central banks to lend freely, against good quality collateral, {{and at a}} <b>penalty</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> to solvent but illiquid banks and other financial institutions during periods of widespread panic and instability. While often taken for granted, these principles were designed for {{a world in which}} central banks have the capacity to create money denominated in the domestic currency, and where banks and other financial institutions issue deposits and other short-term liabilities denominated in the same currency. Unfortunately, this is not {{the world in which we}} live. The application of these principles is far from straightforward where financial institutions rely on short-term foreign currency liabilities as a source of financing. This is the world of the Eurodollar market. The global financial crisis vividly illustrated the potential systemic risks arising from the existence of a large Eurodollar market. Faced with a systemic foreign currency liquidity crisis, central banks struggled to secure access to the foreign currency reserves needed to provide emergency liquidity assistance to their domestic banking systems. In response, the U. S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks establishing a network of swap lines with the objective of providing foreign currency liquidity assistance to the international financial system. The central bank swap lines have been hailed as one of the most important and effective policy responses to the financial crisis. However, while it may be tempting to view them as an effective prophylactic against future foreign currency liquidity crises, the current structure of the swap lines fails to establish truly credible international commitments or constrain the moral hazard problems stemming from this ambitious form of statesponsored liquidity insurance. This paper examines the unique policy challenges posed by foreign currency liquidity problems, along with how to build a more effective framework for the provision of foreign currency liquidity assistance. </p...|$|R

Uncertainty concerning the length of life yields an equilibrium in which private and social <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> discount differ and budget deficits exert real effects. It is shown that a current budget deficit(resulting from a tax cut) raises world <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> On the other hand {{the direction of the}} effect of an expected future deficit on the short-term <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> depends on whether the country is having a surplus or a deficit inits current account of the balance of payments. If it runs a deficit in the current account then the short-term <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> rises and vice versa; the future <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> however, must rise. It is also shown that budget deficits raise domestic wealth and lower foreign wealth and thus result in a negative transmission. In the long run, a higher steady-state value of government debt raises the steady-state world <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> but its effect on the long-run value of foreign wealth is ambiguous. The effects of changes in government spending depend on both the timing and the patterns of spending. A transitory (balanced-budget) rise in current government spending raises the current <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and lowers domestic and foreign wealth while a transitory future rise in government spending lowers the current <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> lowers domestic wealth and raises foreign wealth. A permanent rise in government spending lowers the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> if the current account of the balance of payments is in deficit, and vice versa. Finally, the model is generalized to a multi-commodity world and the impact of policies are shown to depend on comparison among various spending and saving propensities of private sectors and of governments. ...|$|R
