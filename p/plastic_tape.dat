25|$|Many modern hoopers {{make their}} own hoops out of {{polyvinyl}} chloride, polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, or polypropylene tubing. The size {{and the weight of}} the hoop affects style of the hooper. Heavier, larger hoops are more often used for slow hooping and body tricks while lighter, thinner tubing is used for quick hand tricks. These hoops may be covered in a fabric or <b>plastic</b> <b>tape</b> to ease the amount of work in keeping a hoop twirling around the dancer, and can be very colourful. Some use glow-in-the dark, patterned, or sparkling tape, and others are produced with clear tubing and filled with plastic balls, glitter, or even water to produce visual or audio effects when used.|$|E
25|$|In most cassettes, the {{magnetic}} tape {{is attached to}} each spool with a leader, usually made of strong plastic. This leader protected the weaker magnetic tape from the shock occurring when the tape reached the end. Leaders can be complex: a plastic slide-in wedge anchors a short fully opaque <b>plastic</b> <b>tape</b> to the take-up hub; one or more tinted semi-opaque plastic segments follow; the clear leader (a tintless semi-opaque plastic segment) follows, which wraps almost {{all the way around}} the supply reel, before splicing to {{the magnetic}} tape itself. The clear leader spreads the shock load to a long stretch of tape instead of to the microscopic splice. Various patents have been issued detailing leader construction and associated tape player mechanisms to detect leaders. Cassette tape users would also use spare leaders to repair broken tapes.|$|E

A side effect of this technology was that the text typed on the machine could be easily read from the used ribbon, raising issues where the machines were used for preparing classified documents (ribbons had to be accounted for to ensure that typists did not carry them from the facility).|$|E

2500|$|Practical {{application}} of ultrasonic welding for rigid plastics {{was completed in}} the 1960s. [...] At this point only hard plastics could be welded. [...] The patent for the ultrasonic method for welding rigid thermoplastic parts was awarded to Robert Soloff and Seymour Linsley in 1965. [...] Soloff, the founder of Sonics & Materials Inc., was a lab manager at Branson Instruments where thin plastic films were welded into bags and tubes using ultrasonic probes. [...] He unintentionally moved the probe close to a <b>plastic</b> <b>tape</b> dispenser and the halves of the dispenser welded together. [...] He realized that the probe {{did not need to}} be manually moved around the part but that the ultrasonic energy could travel through and around rigid plastics and weld an entire joint. He went on to develop the first ultrasonic press. [...] The first {{application of}} this new technology was in the toy industry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} get {{ornamental}} trees for landscaping, Colorado blue spuce (Picea pungens Engelm. var. glauca Regel) scions were grafted on Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) rootstocks. An original double-side-veneer grafting method was applied in five experimental or basic variants. The <b>plastic</b> <b>tapes</b> and the ecological Ceraltin ® wax developed by the Re-search and Development of Bio-stimulators (CCDB) BIOS Cluj were tested. In addition, two controls in which the classic raffia and the traditional hot wax and the classic side-veneer-grafting method were used. The obtained results, expressed in percents, were transformed in arcsin square root of percent values, and then a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. Highly significant (p < 0. 001) statistical {{differences were found between}} all grafting variants, including controls. The Duncan test proved that original double-side-veneer grafting method and the new developed materials, i. e. <b>plastic</b> <b>tapes</b> and the ecological Ceraltin ® wax have contributed in getting a better grafting success compared to the controls. Thus, the double-side-veneer grafting method and the two grafting materials are highly recom-mended to be used in getting grafted Colorado blue spuce ornamental trees...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Chips {{scraping}} {{each other}} during transportation, and chips coming into contact with water or air will cause oxidization resulting in poor quality products. The chips need to be well packed and {{to be protected from}} the environment. The method of Surface Mount Component (SMC) packing using <b>plastic</b> carrier <b>tape</b> can reduce chip damage. This study focuses on the extrusion process parameters optimization of <b>plastic</b> carrier <b>tape.</b> Because each extrusion process produces 270 pieces of carrier tape, the tape size is 1. 35 mmX 2. 25 mmX 1. 35 mm and is extremely difficult to reach the tolerance standard. This study utilized a practical test to explore various factors {{on the quality of the}} carrier tape, such as the rotational speed of extruder screw motor and extrusion mold; the negative pressure of extrusion mold; and the temperature of the extrusion mold. These experiments could find out an optimal extrusion process...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} {{estimate}} 3 D shape of deformable <b>plastic</b> <b>tapes</b> from multiple camera images. In this method, the tape is modeled as serial connection of multiple rectangular plates, where the size of each plate is previously known and node angles of between plates represent {{the shape of the}} object. The node angles of the object are estimated by 2 D silhouette shapes taken in the multiple images. The estimation is performed by minimizing the difference of the silhouette shapes between the input images and synthesized images of the model shape. For demonstrating the proposed method, 3 D shape of a tape is estimated with two camera images. The accuracy of the estimation is sufficient for making the assembling robot in our plant to handle the tape. Computation time is also sufficiently short for applying the proposed algorithm in the assembling plant. ...|$|R
