5|$|Professional {{software}} developers {{are responsible for}} most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development. Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Stanford's Folding@home data servers (over port8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit digital signatures. While the client's graphical user interface (GUI) is open-source, the client is <b>proprietary</b> <b>software</b> citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.|$|E

5|$|Six {{visual effects}} {{companies}} worked in The Rise of Cobra, {{the most prominent}} being Digital Domain, which handled the Paris action sequences and the opening convoy sequence. For the Eiffel Tower destruction, special software was written for depicting how the crumbling metal works. To create the digital Eiffel Tower, the technicians {{had access to the}} original building plans, and built a digital model so complex that it could not fit in a single computer file. For the nanomites, designers used two <b>proprietary</b> <b>software</b> applications for their depiction—one made by Digital Domain, and another by Prime Focus VFX, which also created tools to generate 3D cloud and sky environments for the aerial scenes. Many scenarios were almost fully developed by computer-generated imagery, such as the landing platform of the Pit, the Cobra ice caverns, and the final underwater battle. As for the sound effects themselves, only one is considered popular and isn't instantly recognizable. When the pulse cannon fires upon the main submarine during the polar assault, the sound of a program de-resolution from the 1982 cult movie classic TRON can be heard.|$|E
25|$|Richard Stallman has {{expressed}} concern that the Pirate Party’s goal of reducing copyright term to 5 years could harm the free software movement. Many free software licenses, mainly the GPL, are based on long-term copyrights. Stallman argues that if copyright terms are reduced to 5 years, <b>proprietary</b> <b>software</b> vendors would be able to take free software and use it in <b>proprietary</b> <b>software</b> once the copyright expires. But <b>proprietary</b> <b>software</b> is restricted by EULAs in addition to copyright, and the source code is not available, rendering the <b>proprietary</b> <b>software</b> unusable for free software developers even after its copyright expires. Stallman suggests that under this new copyright law, <b>proprietary</b> <b>software</b> developers should put their code in escrow when the software's binaries are released and then release their software into the public domain immediately after their copyright expires.|$|E
25|$|These {{movements}} share {{fundamental differences}} in the view on open software. The main, factionalizing difference between the groups {{is the relationship between}} open source and <b>proprietary</b> <b>software.</b> Often makers of <b>proprietary</b> <b>software,</b> such as Microsoft, may make efforts to support open source software to remain competitive. Members of the open source community are willing to coexist with the makers of <b>proprietary</b> <b>software</b> and feel that the issue of whether software is open source is a matter of practicality.|$|E

25|$|While {{cognizant}} {{of the fact that}} both, the free software movement and the open source movement, share similarities in practical recommendations regarding open source, the free software movement fervently continues to distinguish themselves from the open source movement entirely. The free software movement maintains that it has fundamentally different attitudes towards the relationship between open source and <b>proprietary</b> <b>software.</b> The free software community does not view the open source community as their target grievance, however. Their target grievance is <b>proprietary</b> <b>software</b> itself.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{members of}} the free {{software}} community maintain the vision that all software {{is a part of}} freedom of speech and that <b>proprietary</b> <b>software</b> is unethical and unjust. The free software movement openly champions this belief through talks that denounce <b>proprietary</b> <b>software.</b> As a whole the community refuses to support <b>proprietary</b> <b>software.</b> Further there are external motivations for these developers. One motivation is that, when a programmer fixes a bug or makes a program it benefits others in an open source environment. Another motivation is that a programmer can work on multiple projects that they find interesting and enjoyable. Programming in the open source world can also lead to commercial job offers or entrance into the venture capital community. These are just a few reasons why open source programmers continue to create and advance software.|$|E

25|$|GNOME {{was started}} on August 15 1997 by Miguel de Icaza and Federico Mena {{as a free}} {{software}} project to develop a desktop environment and applications for it. It was founded in part because K Desktop Environment, which was growing in popularity, relied on the Qt widget toolkit which used a <b>proprietary</b> <b>software</b> license until version 2.0 (June 1999). In place of Qt, the GTK+ toolkit {{was chosen as the}} base of GNOME. GTK+ uses the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), a free software license that allows software linking to it to use a much wider set of licenses, including <b>proprietary</b> <b>software</b> licenses. GNOME itself is licensed under the LGPL for its libraries, and the GNU General Public License (GPL) for its applications.|$|E
