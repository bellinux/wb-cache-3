After a survey in 2005, the ten most common species {{were found to be}} common tern, herring gull, black-headed gull, common gull, mallard, tufted duck, Canada goose, common goldeneye, lesser black-backed gull and common sandpiper. White-tailed eagle, greylag goose, {{barnacle}} goose, black-throated diver, red-breasted merganser and gadwall are less common, and some of these latter are endangered in the Mälaren area. Since 1994 a subspecies of great cormorant <b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>carbo</b> <b>sinensis,</b> has nested there as well. A 2005 survey tallied 23 breeding colonies with 2178 nests, of which the largest colony had 235 nests. Most experts believe the great cormorant population has peaked and will stabilize at around 2000 nests.|$|E

40|$|Since {{many years}} now it is rumoured that the inland European {{cormorant}} <b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>carbo</b> <b>sinensis</b> was introduced by Dutchmen from China to Holland in the 16 th century to perform cormorant fishing in Europe and thus has to be classified an Invasive Alien Spe-cies (IAS). Although this hypothesis {{is not based on}} scientific evidence it has alreadybeen referred to in scientific literature. To check its plausibility, this review confronts three es-sential aspects of the introduction hypothesis with German sources mainly from the Middle Ages and historical reports on European cormorant fishing. The analyses show that there is no evidence for the introduction of birds from China. Instead, a medieval breeding record aswell as regular appearance of the cormorant in religious and secular lit-erature from the Middle Ages show that the bird was at least temporarily well-known in deeper inland regions of the German-speaking area. The results raise strong doubts about the hypothesis of <b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>carbo</b> <b>sinensis</b> being an introduced alien species. 1...|$|E

Since the early ‘ 80 s this species has began to rise considerably, probably due to conservation programs held in North Europe colonies. This fast population growth is cause of major concern among fishermen, afraid for the loss of the fish stocks. In this work we analyse, through the mucous mixtures method (flock or bolus), the diet composition of the cormorants from the colony located in Cabras lagoon dormitory (ZPS ITB 034008), to evaluate which species were more preyed and their impact on fisheries. The study of the diet was conducted during the wintering season 2010 / 2011, between October and March. A total of 438 pellets were collected. Through morphological analysis of hard body parts, such as otoliths found in the flock, it was possible to evaluate biomass and prey species composition as well as the average daily consumption.

An index of the proportion of first-year birds and older birds that drowned was obtained for cormorants ringed in the Danish Vorsø colony using resightings of colour-ringed individuals and ring recoveries of individuals found dead. First-year birds were approximately 10 times more likely to drown than older birds. We used ring recoveries of cormorants ringed in Denmark and found dead in Denmark, North Germany and South Sweden (i. e. in the main postbreeding area) to reveal changes over a 25 -year period in the proportion drowned among those recovered.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on transboundary {{conflicts}} between great cormorants, <b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>carbo</b> L., and European fisheries interests. Two races of this species commonly occur in Europe; the ‘Atlantic’ <b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>carbo</b> carbo and the ‘Continental’ P. c. sinensis. This migratory fish-eating bird has steadily expanded its European range and many consider this a nature conservation success. However, fishery representatives see the birds as harmful to their business and way of life, considering European Union (EU) legislation to be blocking the most intuitive and effective solution to the cormorant problem, namely co-ordinated, pan-European population reduction. This article argues that cormorant-fisheries conflicts and their resolution and management cannot be characterised as, or reduced to, a simplistic ‘pan-European’ vs ‘local’ argument. The nature of cormorant-fisheries conflicts is explored, key issues of cormorant ecology examined, and consideration is given to how impacts on fisheries might be measured. Discussions then focus on whether current policy prevents balanced and constructive solutions or whether better use of available instruments at local-national levels could actually be a vital step to a sustainable management solution...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the diet of a piscivorus top predator, the Great Cormorant (<b>Phalacrocorax</b> <b>carbo</b> <b>sinensis),</b> in the Baltic Sea. The Great Cormorant has increased exponentially in numbers {{during the last}} decades.

Information about the diet of cormorant along the Swedish Baltic coast and knowledge about the appropriate methodology to use for investigating potential ecosystem impacts and predatory effects on fish populations is, however, lacking. This thesis therefore examined the diet at two coastal locations, in the Bothnian Sea and in the Baltic Proper. Diets were examined with different methodologies to enable evaluation of its uses and applications. For an overall diet, pellets, regurgitate material and stomach content were considered. By tagging fish, estimates of the predatory pressure could be achieved.
