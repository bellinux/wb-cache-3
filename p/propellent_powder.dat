40|$|DE 102005037017 A 1 UPAB: 20070417 NOVELTY - Powder {{concentrate}} comprises nitrocellulose (1 {{to greater}} than 45 wt. %), energetic softener (greater than 55 to 99 wt. %), {{at least a}} crystalline energy source (0 - 30 wt. %), at least an alcohol (0 - 5 wt. %), at least a phlegmatic agent (0 - 5 wt. %) {{and at least a}} stabilizer (0 - 3 wt. %). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for the preparation of <b>propellent</b> <b>powder</b> comprising using powder concentrate. USE - The powder concentrate is useful for the preparation of <b>propellent</b> <b>powder</b> (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The processing of the powder concentrate is simple...|$|E
40|$|Tribasic <b>propellent</b> <b>powders</b> {{consist of}} {{cellulose}} nitrate, nitroglycerine or an explosive oil {{with the same}} effect and crystalline nitroguanidine which are processed into solid propellant powder bodies by mixing and plastification of the NC {{by means of a}} solvent, e. g. acetone, and by needing the mixture and finally shaping it. To improve temperature stability, in particular cold brittle behaviour, at least one organic titanate from the group of monoalkoxyl, chelate, quaternery, neoalkoxyl or coordinated titanates and/or at least one organic ziroconate from the group of neoalkoxyl zirconates are added to the propellant powder at a ratio of <= 2 %, preferably <= 0. 5 %. As a result of this addition, the chemical stability of the propellant powder is further enhanced...|$|R
