40|$|Background Cardiovascular disease, {{obesity and}} {{diabetes}} mellitus have become major causes of premature death and disability in affluent countries. Diet and lifestyle factors are leading causative {{factors contributing to}} these escalating epidemics. An individual’s diet {{plays a significant role}} in the digestion and absorption of CHO. Pasta is a staple food known to have a low glycaemic index. Resistant starch which is found naturally in pasta may have auspicious health benefits and functional properties. The resistance of starch, however, can be significantly influenced by food preparation techniques. Recent research has demonstrated that the ingestion of pasta that has been reheated after being chilled overnight may be a healthier alternative to freshly cooked pasta. Materials and Methods Four healthy female subjects aged 21 - 22, were recruited from Queen Margaret University. The participants attended three consecutive tests days, where they each consumed a portion of white pasta with a basic tomato sauce. The study measured post prandial glucose responses via the blood and saliva after the consumption of three pasta meals; freshly <b>prepared</b> <b>pasta,</b> pasta that had been chilled in fridge overnight and pasta that had been chilled and then reheated. Blood and salivary glucose responses where both measured at baseline and at 15, 30, 45, 75 and 120 minute intervals, post consumption of the test meal. One way ANOVAs with Bonferonni post hoc corrections were used to determine significant differences. Results Analysis of the blood glucose data using one way ANOVA revealed that there was no significant difference between the preparation methods. Blood glucose analysis determined that the highest peak was observed following consumption of the reheated pasta. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between the preparation methods and the salivary glucose responses. Conclusions The findings of this study suggest that consuming chilled or reheated pasta instead of freshly <b>prepared</b> <b>pasta</b> does not produce a lower spike in blood glucose concentrations when tested on healthy individuals. For firm conclusions to be reached further studies must be carried out with a higher number of subject participants...|$|E
40|$|High fiber low gluten {{whole grain}} flours of wheat, barley, soybean, maize, millets, mungbean, oats and flaxseeds were blended in various {{proportions}} as a partial replacement for wheat flour along with Xanthan gum @ 2 % {{for the development}} of nutritionally enriched pasta. <b>Prepared</b> <b>pasta</b> samples were assessed for cooking quality, color characteristics, sensory properties and selected samples were packed in HDPE bags and stored for 90 days and the stored samples were analyzed for changes in their moisture content, free fatty acids, water activity, cooking quality and overall acceptability at 30 days interval. Substitution of wheat flour by multigrain flour in pasta making significantly (p< 0. 05) increased the water absorption and volume expansion while it significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased the cooking time. The loss of solids in cooking water increased significantly (p< 0. 05) with the use of multigrain flour. Color characteristics and overall acceptability scores of multigrain pasta were comparable with pasta made of wheat flour. Cooking quality of pasta was not significantly influenced by the 90 days storage period. Significant (p< 0. 05) increase in moisture content, water activity and free fatty acid was found during the 90 days storage.

Analysis of variance indicates that quadratic effects significantly (p< 0. 001) affected the response in terms of moisture content (MC), expansion ratio (ER), hardness (HD), crispness (CSP), colour (L-value) and colour difference (∆E). The optimal microwave puffing of the cold extrudate could be conducted by convective heating at 200 °C for 300 sec followed by microwave puffing with 90 % of 1350 W for 90 sec.

The impact of cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase (TG) {{on the quality of}} faba pasta was also studied. The structure, cooking quality, starch digestibility, textural and sensory characteristics of faba pasta samples were evaluated and compared to semolina <b>pasta.</b> <b>Pasta</b> <b>prepared</b> with faba bean and fermented faba bean flours had higher cooking loss (10. 8 – 11. 5 %) and lower water absorption (130 - 160 %) than semolina pasta (6 and 193 %), but <b>pasta</b> <b>prepared</b> from fractionated faba flour had similar water absorption to semolina pasta. The texture of pasta made with faba bean flour was comparable to that of semolina pasta. Fermentation adversely affected the texture by increasing hardness, chewiness, sourness and flavour intensity.

5000|$|Cuisine {{traditionally}} {{attributed to}} the poor often mixes pasta with legumes. The most popular are: pasta e fagioli (pasta with beans), sometimes enriched with pork rind (cotiche), pasta e ceci (pasta with chickpeas), pasta e lenticchie (pasta with lentils), pasta e piselli (pasta with peas). Nowadays cicerchie (Lathyrus sativus) have become very rare. Similarly to legumes, other vegetables are associated with pasta, like pasta e patate (pasta with potatoes), pasta e cavolfiore (pasta with cauliflower), pasta e zucca (pasta with pumpkin). The most traditional cooking method consists in cooking the condiments first, for instance, pan fry garlic with oil, then add steamed beans, or fry onion and celery, then add potatoes cut into little dices; then, after frying, water is added, brought to boiling temperature, salted, and pasta is added and stirred frequently. While cooking {{with all the other}} ingredients, pasta does not lose its starch, which would have lost if cooked separately in salty water and then drained. Cooking pasta together with vegetables makes the sauce more creamy ("azzeccato"), and is a way of <b>preparing</b> <b>pasta</b> distinct from the tradition of [...] "noble" [...] cuisine, which prepares similar dishes in a way more similar to broth or soups, adding pasta after cooking it separately.
