5|$|The most usual {{explanation}} for {{the origin of the}} name Widnes is that it comes from the Danish words vid, meaning wide, and noese, meaning nose and that it refers to the <b>promontory</b> projecting into the River Mersey. However, the Widnes <b>promontory</b> is not particularly wide and another possible explanation is the first part derives from the Danish ved, meaning a wood and possibly referring to a tree-covered <b>promontory.</b> Earlier spellings of the name have been Vidnes, Wydnes and Wydness.|$|E
5|$|The north <b>promontory</b> is {{anchored}} by a circular grass area, {{which serves as}} a heliport in case of emergencies, and the south <b>promontory</b> {{is anchored}} by a succulent plant and cactus garden.

The hillside around the complex has been planted with California Live Oak (Quercus agrifolia) trees.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{complicated}} shoreline the island {{has a number}} of <b>promontories,</b> some of which bear identical names, such as Qoornoq and Apparsuit.

5000|$|A key {{property}} of the fractal is self-similarity; that is, at any scale the same general configuration appears. A coastline is perceived as bays alternating with <b>promontories.</b> In the hypothetical situation that a given coastline has this {{property of}} self-similarity, then no matter how greatly any one small section of coastline is magnified, a similar pattern of smaller bays and <b>promontories</b> superimposed on larger bays and <b>promontories</b> appears, {{right down to the}} grains of sand. At that scale the coastline appears as a momentarily shifting, potentially infinitely long thread with a stochastic arrangement of bays and <b>promontories</b> formed from the small objects at hand. In such an environment (as opposed to smooth curves) Mandelbrot asserts [...] "coastline length turns out to be an elusive notion that slips between the fingers of those who want to grasp it." ...|$|R

5|$|There are prehistoric fort sites at promontories near Kilmory, Papadil and Glen Shellesder of {{uncertain}} date.

At Shellesder, the <b>promontory</b> contains the remains of three round stone-walled huts, one of which integrates with the dividing wall. A small number of cairns, again of uncertain date, are also located along the coast.|$|E

5|$|A. H. A. Hogg {{identified}} {{four types}} of hillfort: contour forts, <b>promontory</b> forts, cliff forts and ridge forts. Contour forts, where banks and ditches are moulded {{to the shape of}} the hill, are the dominant form in Scotland. Less significant are <b>promontory</b> forts, usually employing coastal features, such as the largest one in Scotland at the Mull of Galloway. Different types of defensive style occurred throughout the Iron Age period, some of which may have been a response to Roman siege warfare. There were different combinations in the use of earth, stone or timber. Timber was frequently in-filled with stone or other materials. In continental Europe the timber is often arranged vertically, but in Scotland horizontal timbers were more common. The function of hillforts has been much debated. It was traditionally assumed that they were primarily defensive in nature, but {{in the late twentieth century}} this view began to be questioned and social, ritual and religious functions were emphasised.|$|E

5|$|Banksia serrata {{has shown}} a {{variable}} susceptibility to dieback from the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, the plants in sandier soils showing more resistance than those in heavier soils.

5|$|The castle is divided, {{along its}} length, into three enclosures, each {{separated}} by a deep dry moat.

5|$|The castle stands precipitously above a loop of the River North Esk, {{which protects}} it on three sides.

5|$|A $2.5 {{million bond}} issue passed in 1922 for a stadium {{conceived}} by Burnham. Designed by architects Holabird & Roche and named Soldier Field for {{the veterans of}} World War I, cost overruns required another bond issue in 1926. By 1924, the breakwater wall stretched from 14th to 55th Streets. In 1926, Soldier Field and a portion of Lake Shore Drive were opened. Landfilling extended from 23rd Street to 56th Street; however, <b>Promontory</b> Point was not complete, prompting complaints regarding garbage, blowing sand and odors. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, landfill efforts continued to fill in Burnham Park and the adjacent Northerly Island. The South Development was named for Daniel Burnham on January 14, 1927, and support increased for a world's fair in the park. Construction was completed on Lake Shore Drive, with northbound lanes named for Leif Erikson, and southbound lanes for Christopher Columbus. In 1929, construction of the park at <b>Promontory</b> Point began. The Great Depression delayed work and prevented construction of nearshore islands. Burnham Park was chosen for {{the site of the}} Century of Progress world's fair and a yacht basin was built south of 51st Street.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a <b>promontory</b> {{overlooking}} Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular {{contact with the outside world}} and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E
