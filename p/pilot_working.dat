25|$|From 1899 the {{competitive}} pilot system was abolished {{and a new}} piloting law was introduced, establishing the Naval Pilot Authority. By 1910 {{there was only one}} pilot left at Fedje. This was dramatically changed during the First World War, when series of British convoys traveled up and down the coast. Soon there were four pilots stationed at Fedje, and when needed experienced fishermen were also used. After {{the end of the war}} in 1918 things settled down and from 1920 there was only a single <b>pilot</b> <b>working</b> out of Fedje. This was further increased to two in 1927. During the 1930s each of them had an average thirty missions per year. Pilots were required to have a house with a good view of the open sea towards the direction of the sea lane. Of this reason placing houses at Hesthaugen was popular amongst the pilots. There was a new boom in pilot demand during the Second World War, with an average 69 missions per year.|$|E
