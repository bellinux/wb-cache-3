40|$|In 1990, {{a fire in}} the of « Lens et Crêtes de Mabousquet » Wood led to the {{discovery}} and to the looting of several archaeological sites. A small ancient circular construction was excavated illegally. Around this archaeological structure, many metal objects (coins, rings, fibulae [...] .) were found as well as votive furniture (altars, vases, statuettes). Between 1991 and 1993, an excavation campaign supported by the Regional Service of the Archaeology of Languedoc-Roussillon and the General council of the Gard revealed a place of worship (End of Isl century BC - Ist century AD) where votive practices dedicated to local female divinities could hâve been held.

2500|$|The Toilette of Esther or Esther Preparing to be Presented to King Ahasuerus, is an 1841 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Théodore Chassériau. The painting depicts a moment from the scriptural Book of Esther, when Esther prepared to meet King Ahasuerus, ruler of Persia, who subsequently took her as his wife. The painting {{is in the}} Musée du Louvre. Vincent <b>Pomarède</b> of the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon has described it as [...] "one {{of the most famous}} (paintings) in the Louvre".|$|E

The chateau contains the Maire (town hall), a post office and small library, a primary school, and a privately owned hotel and restaurant. There is also a parish church (Roman Catholic) and cemetery in the commune. Self-catering accommodation is available in gites a few minutes' walk from the chateau.|$|E

He later created the free magazine Le Petit biterrois but had to close it down {{due to a lack}} of advertisers. In 1985 he created Reporters sans Frontières.|$|E

40|$|Starting {{out from}} the {{background}} of contemporary art practices in post-civil war Lebanon, this thesis investigates the complex negotations and deconstructions of the archive that Walid Raad´s project The Atlas Group is undertaking. The first chapter looks into the specific agency of montage {{that is being used}} in the work Let ́s be honest the weather helped. A transformative relationship between hiding and affirming is established here, which produces 'potentiality'. In a second step, I will analyse how the subjective nature of history writing is revealed by works in The Atlas Group. The theories of Hayden White will serve as a basis for this chapter. Jalal Toufic ́s concept of the withdrawal of tradition will provide a fundament the second section of this chapter as White and Toufic are going to be put in dialogue. Toufic argues that objects and documents happen to be 'withdrawn' after traumatic events - a unconventional notion that also is reverberating in some pieces by Walid Raad. Thirdly, authority and authorship will serve as two anchor points for further observations as these two are interdependent and integral to the questions, which The Atlas Group is raising. Fourthly, I will analyse how not only the incapability of the document to record 'the decisive' moment is revealed, but also how allusions to this imperceptible instance are being made - an interview Jean Francois Lyotard and Alain <b>Pomarède</b> will enable deeper understanding of these observations...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the cryotolerant yeast species S. uvarum {{is also used}} for wine and cider fermentation but nothing is known about its natural history. Here we use a population genomics approach to investigate its global phylogeography and domestication fingerprints using a collection of isolates obtained from fermented beverages and from natural environments on five continents. South American isolates contain more genetic diversity than that found in the Northern Hemisphere. Moreover, coalescence analyses suggest that a Patagonian sub-population {{gave rise to the}} Holarctic population through a recent bottleneck. Holarctic strains display multiple introgressions from other Saccharomyces species, those from S. eubayanus being prevalent in European strains associated with humandriven fermentations. These introgressions are absent in the large majority of wild strains and gene ontology analyses indicate that several gene categories relevant for wine fermentation are overrepresented. Such findings constitute a first indication of domestication in S. uvarum. Fil: Almeida, Pedro. Universidade Nova de Lisboa; PortugalFil: Goncalves, Carla.
