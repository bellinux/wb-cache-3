5000|$|A {{distribution}} center {{for a set}} of products is a warehouse or other specialized building, often with refrigeration or air conditioning, which is stocked with products (goods) to be redistributed to retailers, to wholesalers, or directly to consumers. A {{distribution center}} is a principal part, the order processing element, of the entire order fulfillment process. Distribution centers are usually thought of as being demand driven. A distribution center can also be called a warehouse, a DC, a fulfillment center, a cross-dock facility, a bulk break center, and a <b>package</b> <b>handling</b> center. The name by which the distribution center is known is commonly based on the purpose of the operation. For example, a [...] "retail distribution center" [...] normally distributes goods to retail stores, an [...] "order fulfillment center" [...] commonly distributes goods directly to consumers, and a cross-dock facility stores little or no product but distributes goods to other destinations.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} years, postal operations, {{which included the}} station's own underground post office railway, had growing problem due to the interference of passengers. On 18 August 1969, a separate <b>package</b> <b>handling</b> facility was brought into operation at Wilhelm-Hale-Stra√üe, which was connected with the station by a double-track line. The Starnberg wing station was affected by {{the construction of the}} S-Bahn trunk line from 1967 because the trunk line was built under it. The trunk line and the new underground station were taken into operation on 28 April 1972 in time for the 1972 Summer Olympics. During the Summer Olympics the station had a high volume of passengers. On 2 September 1972, there were, for example, 35,000 passengers, excluding S-Bahn operations. The first U-Bahn lines, U8/U1 (now U2/U1) commenced operations through the station on 18 October 1980. As a further development of the S-Bahn, the line to Wolfratshausen as S-Bahn line S 7 was connected to the trunk line with a 260-metre-long tunnel under all the tracks on 31 May 1981. Until then the S-Bahn trains to and from Wolfratshausen, then called line S 10, ended and started in Holzkirchen wing station. The U-Bahn platform on lines U4/U5 opened on 10 March 1984. In the 1980s, the entrance building was converted under the leadership of Ekkehard Fahr, Dieter Schaich and Josef Reindl into a circulating hall with a travel centre {{in order to create a}} transparent and open environment. In the timetable of the summer of 1989, the station was the twelfth largest node in the network of Deutsche Bundesbahn, with 269 arrivals and departures by scheduled long-distance services per day.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} the package concept {{developed for the}} demands of the HPGP project. Our design borrows from similar concepts found in Java, C++, ML, or Ada but is strictly more powerful and we hope also more practical. In our concept, packages serve three main purposes: 1. Decomposing the global namespace into disjoint subspaces. 2. Distributing the program files into different directories. 3. Controlling the use of foreign packages. We achieve these goals by mechanisms for the explicit control of package environments that stem from the underlying directory structure but may be manipulated to determine each package's view of the world. On top of the <b>package</b> <b>handling</b> concepts, mechansisms for dependence control have been implemented; support for revision control is planned.

40|$|The grocery retail industry, {{with its}} large product volumes, low margins and fierce competition, is {{constantly}} seeking efficiency improvements in its supply chain. The grocery retail industry uses an immense amount of packaging and is {{directly affected by}} packaging logistics activities. There is, therefore, a potential for efficiency improvements in the grocery retail supply chain through the integration and development of new systems of packaging and logistics. <b>Packaging</b> <b>handling</b> is identified {{as one of the}} main activities that has a strong impact on the overall logistical cost of a grocery chain. This research article investigates <b>packaging</b> <b>handling</b> evaluation methods and discusses how these are employed to benefit the industry. Case studies, involving six major companies from the Swedish grocery retail industry, have been used to evaluate packaging and logistics activities. This work, together with a literature review, was used to identify the need for evaluative methods and the present availability of such methods. The results indicated a lack of sufficient and usable <b>packaging</b> <b>handling</b> evaluation methods in today's grocery and packaging industry especially from a logistical point of view.

The {{purpose of the}} cells is to provide safe environments for <b>package</b> <b>handling</b> and sealing operations. Once sealed, the packages are placed in the Yucca Mountain Repository. Closure of a typical waste package involves a number of remote operations. Those involved typically include the placement of matched lids onto the waste package. The lids are then individually sealed to the waste package by welding. Currently, the waste package includes three lids. One lid is placed before movement of the waste package to the closure cell; the final two are placed inside the closure cell, where they are welded to the waste package. These and other important operations require considerable remote material handling within the cell environment.

40|$|This study {{measured}} and analyzed the vibration characteristics {{of an important}} component of the air package shipping environment which has not been previously studied or included in the pre-shipment testing of packages. This is the movement of packages between aircraft after they are flown in to an airport-hub and being taken into a facility to conduct a sort, or after being sorted as they are transferred back on to aircraft. These transfers at airport-hubs between trucks, building sortation facilities and aircraft are done using material handling equipment called ‚Äúdollies‚Äù or carts. These carts often are connected with each other into small trains and then pulled by tug motors on aircraft tarmacs. This study measured the vibration levels experienced by these carts or dollies with and without packages placed in dollies in two different sizes of carts. The data was analyzed to determine the vibration characteristics. Results show that existing vibration test methods do not cover the significant high levels of vibration that are used to simulate truck and aircraft shipments in accordance with existing vibration test methods developed by American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) and International Safe Transit Association (ISTA).

40|$|HLM (Hierarchical Linear Models) is a {{stand-alone}} software <b>package</b> <b>handling</b> multilevel or random effect models {{and has been}} under development since the mid 1980 s. The theoretical background and technical details behind the program are mainly found in the book by Bryk and Raudenbush (1992), {{and in the second}} edition (2002) as well as in many of their other publications. HLM was programmed by Richard Congdon with the two named authors. The early versions of HLM could be used with both an interactive interface and a batch mode running under MS-DOS. The first Windows version of HLM came out in 1997. HLM 5. 04 is the latest version for Windows, released in July 2001 by the HLM development team and published by Scientific Software International (SSI) based at Lincolnwood in the USA. SSI sells HLM directly to the enduser and also uses several distributors. In this version ten new modeling features are highlighted, including multinomial and ordinal models for two-level data, multivariate models for incomplete data, latent variable analysis, log-linear model for heterogeneous level 1 variance. HLM has been a popular program used by professional researchers and research students worldwide in areas of education and social science research as well as public health research.

30|$|Processing and {{preservation}} of meat by pastoralists is done locally in the villages, on demand, mostly by women who rely on rudimentary technologies. The meat does not find {{its way to the}} formal market because of the challenges of difficulties in <b>package</b> <b>handling</b> and unstandardized, unoptimized quality in processing and storage. The processing is mainly based on indigenous knowledge and the packaging lacks the finesse and the attractiveness of the modern meat package. The size of the cut varies extensively, between and within communities, even for the same product. The packaging used moreover may expose the products to vagaries of the weather, increasing the susceptibility to autoxidation of the fat that the product is abundantly associated with. The packaging used for these products has been demonstrated in our earlier publication (Gichure et al. 2015). Currently, less than 5 % of these products are marketed, mainly in the informal markets within the communities, while the rest is consumed at home. The products are not able to surmount the restrictions of the formal market due to various limitations already described (Gichure et al. 2016). In these communities, women rarely own resources, may have less education and cannot access modern infrastructure. This additionally limits their participation in the formal meat products value chain. Previous research on consumer willingness to pay for pastoral meats indicate that finely chopped meat that is tender is most preferred (Wanyoike et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{surface storage}} of intermediate-level {{radioactive}} waste (ILW) {{has become an}} important issue for regulators and site operators in the UK following deferral of the Nirex deep repository for the disposal of ILW, and the resulting hiatus in Government policy. This paper identifies some key life-cycle issues associated with interim safe storage (ISS) of ILW, and also {{some of the key}} features of existing stores. Important risk management issues include store design and environmental controls, conditioning and packaging, <b>package</b> <b>handling</b> and cranes, operation, monitoring of waste packages, package retrieval, external environmental factors, stakeholder issues and costs. All of these issues will need to be addressed during the design, construction and operation of an ILW store. Given the wide and diverse range of issues requiring consideration, {{it may be difficult to}} choose between alternative design concepts or risk management strategies. We demonstrate a multi-criteria decision analysis approach to ILW storage in which the various attributes of alternative store designs and management strategies are scored and collectively compared using the program OnBalance. By varying the weighting of the different attributes, the sensitivity of the overall score of the various designs to their attributes may be evaluated. Ultimately, the technical issues related to store design, construction and operation will have to be balanced against the non-technical factors that may influence the development of a store, particularly those related to stakeholder interactions and public concerns. Developing a long-term interim storage strategy requires a holistic approach that embraces all of these factors...|$|E
40|$|Developing {{specialized}} Electro-Static grippers (commercially used in Semiconductor Manufacturing and in <b>package</b> <b>handling)</b> {{will allow}} gentle and secure Capture, Soft Docking, and Handling {{of a wide}} variety of materials and shapes (such as upper-stages, satellites, arrays, and possibly asteroids) without requiring physical features or cavities for a pincher or probe or using harpoons or nets. Combined with new rigid boom mechanisms or small agile chaser vehicles, flexible, high speed Electro-Static Grippers can enable compliant capture of spinning objects starting from a safe stand-off distance. Electroadhesion (EA) can enable lightweight, ultra-low-power, compliant attachment in space by using an electrostatic force to adhere similar and dissimilar surfaces. A typical EA enabled device is composed of compliant space-rated materials, such as copper-clad polyimide encapsulated by polymers. Attachment is induced by strong electrostatic forces between any substrate material, such as an exterior satellite panel and a compliant EA gripper pad surface. When alternate positive and negative charges are induced in adjacent planar electrodes in an EA surface, the electric fields set up opposite charges on the substrate and cause an electrostatic adhesion between the electrodes and the induced charges on the substrate. Since the electrodes and the polymer are compliant and can conform to uneven or rough surfaces, the electrodes can remain intimately close to the entire surface, enabling high clamping pressures. Clamping pressures of more than 3 N/cm 2 in shear can be achieved on a variety of substrates with ultra-low holding power consumption (measured values are less than 20 microW/Newton weight held). A single EA surface geometry can be used to clamp both dielectric and conductive substrates, with slightly different physical mechanisms. Furthermore EA clamping requires no normal force be placed on the substrate, as conventional docking requires. Internally funded research and development has demonstrated that EA can function effectively in space, even in the presence of strong ultraviolet radiation, atomic oxygen, and free electrons. We created a test setup in an existing vacuum chamber to simulate low-Earth-orbit conditions. An EA mechanism was fabricated and installed in the chamber, instrumented, operated in a vacuum, and subjected to ultraviolet photons and free electrons generated by an in-chamber multipactor electron emitter. Extensions to EA that can add value include proximity and contact sensing and transverse motion or rotation, both of which could enhance docking or assembly applications. Possible next steps include development of targeted applications for ground investigation or on-orbit subsystem performance demonstrations using low cost access to space such as CubeSats...|$|E
