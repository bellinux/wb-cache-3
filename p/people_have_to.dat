25|$|The town is criss-crossed by {{numerous}} small alleys, once used by fishermen {{to reach the}} beach. Many of these are now registered as public rights of way and are still in frequent use.

25|$|English {{tort law}} is the law {{governing}} implicit civil responsibilities that <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> one another, {{as opposed to those}} responsibilities laid out in contracts.

25|$|The {{best way}} to avoid a Churel is to prevent her creation. This means that <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take good care of {{pregnant}} women. However, if a woman dies, the creation of a Churel can be still prevented and precautionary measures exist and are taken if a woman becomes one. In Tamil culture human priests gather and collectively propitiate her with offerings. In some villages, a Stonehenge-like structure is used to ward off the Churel.|$|E
25|$|A seventh step {{could in}} {{principle}} be added, namely a big crisis in society which sparks off a revolution and overturns the existing capitalist system.

But that is a possibility which Marx did not comprehensively theorize in Das Kapital.|$|E
25|$|In most of Canada, either partner may informally {{assume the}} spouse's surname after marriage, {{so long as}} it is not for the {{purposes}} of fraud. The same is true for people in common-law relationships, in some provinces. This is not considered a legal name change in most provinces, excluding British Columbia. For federal purposes, such as a Canadian passport, Canadians may also assume their partner's surname if they are in a common-law relationship. In the province of British Columbia, <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> undergo a legal name change if they want to use a combined surname after marriage. Their marriage certificate is considered proof of their new name.|$|E

Even though they are typically very poor, these <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps. Solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene. An estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems. Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. More than 30,000 very small solar panels, each producing 12 to 30 watts, are sold in Kenya annually.|$|E
25|$|Rousseau {{believed}} that the theatre took people away from the community, and replaced any patriotic, unifying spirit with artificial emotions. To have a prosperous state, Rousseau believed, people needed {{to work together and}} harmoniously. As an alternative to the theatre, Rousseau proposed open-air republican festivals, with a rich community atmosphere. One of Rousseau's pivotal points in the Letter is that customs, opinions and priorities which are common and well-accepted among all citizens should be those that make accepting laws in favour of respect, equality and harmony a pleasurable and natural experience. In other words, <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> share the concerns with legislators if a state is to be successful.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in his {{argument}} is that when people engage in trade, run a business or work in a job, they adopt and personify (personally represent) a certain function, role or behaviour pattern which is required of them to serve their obligations; their consent to the applicable rules is assumed, as a necessity {{to succeed in the}} activities. They have to act this way, because of the co-operative relationships they necessarily have to work with in the division of labour. <b>People</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> conform to them, whether they like it or not. If they take on a role, they have to fulfill the packet of tasks {{which is part of the}} job.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} modifiable {{risk factors for}} stroke are {{high blood pressure and}} atrial fibrillation although the size of the effect is small with 833 <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be treated for 1 year to prevent one stroke. Other modifiable risk factors include high blood cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking (active and passive), drinking lots of alcohol and drug use, lack of physical activity, obesity, processed red meat consumption and unhealthy diet. Alcohol use could predispose to ischemic stroke, and intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage via multiple mechanisms (for example via hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rebound thrombocytosis and platelet aggregation and clotting disturbances). Drugs, most commonly amphetamines and cocaine, can induce stroke through damage to the blood vessels in the brain and acute hypertension.|$|E

Some Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their sustainability.|$|E
25|$|Continuity {{of water}} supply is poor in most Yemeni cities. For example, in Taiz, the {{frequency}} of the public piped water delivery is only once about every 40days. More and more <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> rely on more costly water provided by private wells supplying water tankers. The quality of this water is questionable because these tankers have often been used for other purposes without appropriate cleaning. According to the Ministry of Water and Environment, 15 of 23 urban water utilities provided water every day for between 12 and 24 hours in 2007. These data do not differentiate between utilities with continuous supply and those with intermittent supply of a “moderate” sort (more than 12 hours daily water supply). The 15 cities thus include Sana’a and Aden that provide intermittent water supply. Four other towns provided water on a daily basis, but less than 12 hours per day. The city of Ibb and the town of Bajil provide water only once a week. And the utilities in Taiz and Mahwit provided water only less than once a week in 2007. However, there are potentially conflicting reports about the continuity of supply. For example, the Ministry reported that water was being provided on a daily basis in Amran in 2007. However, 100% of the respondents to a household survey in the same town in 2008 indicated that they received water only once a week or even once a month.|$|E
