It was found that the factor which made the largest contribution differed between the growing phase and the declining phase of integrated firms. In the growing phase, imitation, namely the change in the attribute of the incumbent firms, was the major factor in the <b>proportion</b> <b>change.</b> On the other hand, in the declining phase, selection, in particular, birth rate, was the major factor, not only in the case where the proportion is measured in terms of firm number but also in terms of production. ...|$|E

40|$|OVERVIEW: The Client Language Assessment - Proximal/Distal (CLA-PD) is a {{language}} rating system for measuring client decision-making in interventions that target a specified behavior change (e. g., alcohol or other drug use). In the CLA-PD, {{there are five}} dimensions of change language (Reason, Ability, Commitment, Taking Steps, Other) adapted from the client portion of the Motivational Interviewing Skill Code (MISC). For the CLA-PD, language codes are sub-divided to discriminate statements regarding the primary, or target behavior change (distal change) from the intermediate coping activities (proximal change) that are prescribed to facilitate that target behavior change. The goal of the CLA-PD is to allow for higher specificity than existing client language measures, when process studies consider interventions that are multi-session and skill-based (e. g., cognitive behavioral therapy). METHOD: Three raters received 40 hours of training {{on the use of}} the CLA-PD. The data were a sample of therapy session audio-files from a completed clinical trial (N= 126), which enabled examination of client language across four sessions (i. e., first three and final attended) of three evidence-based alcohol interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy, twelve-step facilitation therapy, motivational enhancement therapy). RESULTS: Inter-rater reliability results for summary scores showed "excellent" reliability for the measure. Specifically, two-way mixed intraclass coefficients ranged from. 83 to. 95. Internal consistency reliability showed alphas across sessions that ranged from "fair" to "good" (α=. 74 -. 84). In convergent and discriminant validity analyses using data independently measured with MISC-based ratings, the pattern of results was as would be expected. Specifically, convergent correlations, by valence (i. e., change and sustain talk), between CLA-PD Distal and MISC-based language scores were moderate (r=. 46 -. 55, p<. 001) while discriminant correlations by valence for CLA-PD Proximal and MISC-based language scores were small (r=. 22 -. 24, p<. 05). Finally, <b>proportion</b> <b>Change</b> Talk Proximal predicted subsequent session coping behaviors (i. e., processes of change) as well as 3 -month Alcoholics Anonymous involvement and attendance (ps<. 05 -. 005), but not 3 -month alcohol abstinence self-efficacy. Further, analyses of criterion predictive validity showed that <b>proportion</b> <b>Change</b> Talk Distal predicted 3 - and 12 -month drinking frequency and quantity measures (ps<. 05 -. 005). CONCLUSIONS: When behavior change treatments are multi-session and/or skill-based, the present analyses suggest the CLA-PD is a promising, psychometrically sound observational rating measure of client verbalized decision-making...|$|E

The analysis of the responses was based upon interpretations in a measuring device titled, "Student Responses to Selected Interpretations of American History. " This measuring device was created for this study by the researcher. The research was planned to answer the question, "Do students change their responses to selected interpretations of American history at a statistically significant level after participating in a course in American history?"The investigator collected responses to the pre-test and post-test administration of the measuring device from six hundred and fourteen eleventh grade students. An additional eighty-seven responses from sophomores were collected for purposes of comparison with the juniors. The subjects were students from two senior high schools in Indiana. The subjects represented a heterogeneity of socio-economic status, race and achievement levels. The six hundred and fourteen juniors participated in a course in Americanhistory. The eighty-seven sophomores were enrolled in a course in world history at those two schools. Statistical processing of the data consisted of determining the significance of the <b>proportion</b> of <b>changed</b> responses to the measuring device. Coefficients of correlations of proportional change were computed on the basis of sex, intelligence test scores, and grade point averages. An analysis of the difference in <b>proportion</b> of <b>change</b> between sophomores and juniors was also computed. Analysis of the data led to the following findings:Students who had participated in the course in American history at the eleventh grade level changed their responses at a statistically significant level for forty-three of the interpretations. There was no correlation between sex and the <b>proportion</b> of <b>change</b> for forty-three of the interpretations. There was no correlation between intelligence test scores and the <b>proportion</b> of <b>change</b> for forty-three of the interpretations. There was no correlation between grade point average and <b>proportion</b> of <b>change</b> for thirty-eight of the interpretations. For two of the interpretations students with higher grade point averages were more likely to change their responses and for five of the interpretations students with higher grade point averages were less likely to change their responses than were students with a lower grade point average. Students who had participated in the course in American history were more likely to change their responses to ten of the interpretations than were students who had not participated in the course in American history. There was no statistically significant difference between these two groups' <b>proportion</b> of <b>change</b> for thirty-five of the interpretations. The following conclusions have been drawn from the findings: 1. Students who had participated in the course in American history at the eleventh grade level changed their responses at a statistically significant level for forty-three of the interpretations. 2. There was no significant correlation between sex and the <b>proportion</b> of <b>change</b> for forty-three of the interpretations. 3.

Microtensile bond strength and surface charge density were measured for the novel anti-caries adhesives. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus gordonii were chosen to form three-species biofilms. Lactic acid assay, MTT (3 -(4, 5 -Dimethyl-thiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, exopolysaccharide staining and live/dead staining were performed to study anti-biofilm effect of the adhesive. The TaqMan realtime polymerase chain reaction was used to study the <b>proportion</b> <b>change</b> in three-species biofilms of different groups. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to observe the remineralization effect of PAMAM and DMADDM. The results showed that incorporating PAMAM and DMADDM into adhesive had no adverse effect on the dentin bond strength. The 1 % PAMAM and 5 % DMADDM adhesive group showed anti-biofilm properties and developed a healthier biofilm with a lower chance of inducing dental caries. Combination of 1 % PAMAM and 5 % DMADDM solution maintained remineralization capability on dentin, similar to that using 1 % PAMAM alone. In conclusion, the adhesive containing PAMAM and DMADDM had strong antimicrobial properties and biological remineralization capabilities, and is promising for anti-caries clinical applications...|$|E

The results showed that incorporating QAMs with different alkyl chain lengths into the adhesives had no obvious effect on the dentin bond strength. The adhesives containing QAMs with a longer alkyl chain developed healthier biofilms. The surface charge density, anti-biofilm, and anti-demineralization effects of the adhesives increased with a CL of the QAMs from 3 to 12, but decreased slightly with a CL from 12 to 16.

40|$|Ballivet et al. (1) {{recently}} published an interesting {{paper in the}} Journal about the high and increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in New Caledonia. Almost a twofold increase was observed over an 8 -year penod; this is quite dramatic. In addition, the incidence curve for female Melanesians (figure 1 (1, p. 743)) showed a biphasic pattern, indicating an especially notable increase in younger birth cohorts (2). Improved diagnostic capabilities in recent years might be one explanation (3, 4), among others. In general, several factors may influence population in-cidence rates for thyroid cancer, as well as time trends— factors such as intensity of clinical ascertainment (imaging techniques, fine needle aspiration cytology); frequency of surgical treatment for benign thyroid disorders, which might affect detection of incidentally found microcarcinomas; and, finally, autopsy practice. Although the authors state that "no {{major changes in the}} functioning of any source during our study " (1, p. 742) were present, some additional background information might further clarify their report.

Geotechnical studies in England and also in France point out particular problems related to the overconsolidated structure of this material of Triassic age. A vide scatter in observed in the test results between the high values of strength of the unweathered soils and the low values of the softened zones. No simple relation to depth can be estahlished. A classification modified from the scheme proposed by the British research workers, shows that index properties and clay-sized <b>proportion</b> <b>change</b> with the alteration zones, as a result of silt-sized aggregation of clay minerals. Simple unexpensive tests allow quick quantitative evaluation of the unweathered material. Point load test and direct shear test on preformed failure planes give a measure of cohesion and ultimate friction angle. Short term weathering of marls appears closely related to the degree of saturation of the specimen before rewetting. One-dimensional and three-dimensional compression tests of intact and remoulded states are compared and the computed values of permeability from those tests are discussed. Rates of secondary compression are related of the alteration zones and overconsolidation ratio. Theoretical and experimental evidences lead the author to develop a graphical method of obtaining the strength parameters from stress paths in a three-dimensional (shear stress, normal stress, water content) space. Most of the scatter resulting from various swells during alteration, sampling and testing, is thus taken into account. The shape or the undrained compression stress paths correlates with the elastic parameters measured. Hvorslev strength components or Keuper clays and marls are compared with published data for other soils. Measurements of strength parameters by the static cone penetrameter in the weathered profile over Keuper Marl, are evaluated and compared with results obtained on a small-scale laboratory apparatus. The system was designed with a confinement cell (15 x 15 cm) which permitted to simulate the overburden pressure, up to 4 kg/sq cm.

40|$|The {{immunosurveillance}} hypothesis {{states that}} the immune system recognises and responds to tumours preventing growth and progression and that tumour- infiltrating CD 8 + T cells are essential component. However, most immune-based antitumour therapies have had limited efficacy in controlling tumour growth due to immunosuppression within the tumour microenvironment. Experiments described in this thesis were aimed at understanding mechanisms of tumour- mediated immunosuppression of antitumour CTL responses. Studies utilised a BALB/c mouse model comprising renal carcinoma cells (Renca), expressing the haemagglutinin (HA) protein from influenza virus AlPRl 8 /H 1 NI(PR 8) as tumour- specific neo-antigen, and transgenic CL 4 CD 8 + T cells, expressing a high affinity TcR specific for the dominant Kd-restricted epitope of HA. The data show that CL 4 CD 8 + T cells undergo productive activation (PA) in the tumour draining lymph nodes resulting in CTL responses. However, following migration into the tumour they lose effector function, which is accompanied {{by an increase in}} cell- surface expression of Ly 6 C. However, if the interaction of Ly 6 C with its unknown ligand is blocked under conditions that would otherwise result in abortive activation then PA is restored. Other studies revealed that endogenous tumour-infiltrating Iymphocytes (TIL) could suppress CL 4 CTL activity by elaborating adenosine via CD 39 and CD 73 ecto-enzymes. However, suppression was prevented by antagonising the adenosine receptors. Further investigations revealed that expression of CD 39 and CD 73 by endogenous TIL is controlled by TGF-~. Several distinct populations of tumour-infiltrating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Ti-MDSC) were also characterised based on cell-surface expression of different levels of Ly 6 C and Ly 6 G glycoproteins. Not only do their phenotypic profile and relative <b>proportion</b> <b>change</b> over time as the tumours progress, but these Ti-MDSC also express CD 39 and CD 73. These findings demonstrate that various mechanisms of immunosuppression operate within the tumour microenvironment. Therefore, although targeting individual mechanisms may potentially alleviate some of the suppression; enabling partial restoration of CTL activity, it is likely that only by targeting multiple mechanisms will we be able to fully restore CTL activity {{to such an extent that}} the tumour is eradicated.

50|$|Twybils {{are made}} {{in a range of}} sizes, {{depending}} on the size of the work they're intended for. The length of the side handle remains roughly constant at around a hand's span and so their <b>proportions</b> <b>change.</b> A small one intended for making hurdles may have three arms of approximately equal length, a large framing twybil may be three feet long and yet still have the same handle. Diderot's Encyclopédie of the 18th century shows a bisaiguë in use for paring end grain of a large joint, much as a modern slick chisel, which is long enough to rest on the carpenter's shoulder.|$|R
