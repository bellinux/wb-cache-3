40|$|Absenteeism {{of health}} workers in {{developing}} countries is widespread with some estimates indicating rates of provider absence of nearly 40 % (Chaudhry et. al. 2006). This is the first paper to present evidence {{of the impact of}} health provider absence on health outcomes. Using longitudinal data from nearly 600 ante-natal care seekers at a rural ante-natal clinic in Western Kenya, we start by showing that women whose first clinic visit coincides with the <b>nurse’s</b> <b>attendance</b> are nearly 60 percentage points more likely to test for HIV and 13 percentage points more likely to deliver in a hospital or health center. Since the benefits of PMTCT services depend on HIV status, we estimate the heterogeneous impact of absence based on women’s self-reported expectations of being HIV-positive. We find that women with a high pre-test expectation of testing HIVpositive and whose first ANC visit coincides with <b>nurse</b> <b>attendance</b> are 25 percentage points more likely to deliver in a hospital or health center, 7. 4 percentage points more likely to receive PMTCT medication, 9 percentage points less likely to breastfeed and 10 percentage points more likely to enroll in the free AIDS treatment program at the clinic than similar women whose first visit coincides with nurse absence.

This section also involves a concept of basal stimulation and its subsequent integration into the <b>nursing</b> <b>attendance</b> at the intensive care units. The work also deals with a nurse?s role within education of the ICU in-patients? family. Objectives and hypotheses are introduced in further section of the Bachelor?s Thesis. The first objective was aimed at identification of possible differences while using communication skill at the ICUs of various medical scopes. The second objective was focused on finding out of prospective utilization of the basal stimulation concept for the purpose of <b>nursing</b> <b>attendance</b> as a communication chance. The third objective set a goal to identify what communication way was preferred by the ICU nurses while providing nursing care. Pursuant to these objectives of the Thesis hypotheses were defined. Hypothesis 1 (H 1) anticipated that the communication skill was differentiated according to the scope of the intensive care unit. Hypothesis 2 (H 2) supposed that an important element affecting any communication was medical performances frequency. Hypothesis 3 (H 3) assumed that the important element affecting any communication was frequency of nursing interventions. Hypothesis 4 (H 4) envisaged that time necessity while providing <b>nursing</b> <b>attendance</b> at the ICUs influenced the efficiency of the basal stimulation application with patients. Hypothesis 5 (H 5) anticipated that verbal communication was preferred more with patients at the ICUs according to the medical scope. A quantitative method was used for the research investigation of the Bachelor?s Thesis by help of interrogatory investigation. Nameless questionnaires were set and distributed to nurses at the intensive care units of various scopes in the Faculty Hospital Plzeň.

Considerada um momento importante para a vida da mulher, a gravidez sintetiza o encontro de sentimentos ambivalentes: medo, alegria e autoafirmação. Pela importância desse evento para a mulher, decidi refletir sobre a Consulta de Enfermagem no Pré-Natal como espaço que a gestante tem para expressar suas necessidades. Esse estudo tem como objetivo conhecer e analisar as representações sociais das gestantes atendidas no Pré-Natal do Centro de Saúde N. 11 de Brasília, sobre a Consulta de Enfermagem, com a finalidade de oferecer subsídios para melhorar a qualidade dessa assistência. Preliminarmente, procedi à caracterização do perfil da gestante atendida no Pré-Natal no ano de 2004, por meio dos Prontuários e/ou Fichas de Atendimentos. Foram {{realizadas}} entrevistas semi-estruturadas com 13 gestantes. Para sistematizar os dados, utilizei o software ALCESTE, com o intuito de conhecer o discurso coletivo e a identificação dos significados compartilhados por essas mulheres. Os resultados da análise lexical mostraram que as falas se organizaram em torno de três Eixos e seis Classes Temáticas, a saber: Eixo I - Vivenciando a gravidez: mostra elementos significativos acerca da experiência vivida pelas mulheres durante a gravidez, o que possibilita identificar e entender como elas perceberam que estavam grávidas, bem como as mudanças biológicas e emocionais experienciadas. Eixo II - Recebendo orientações sobre a gravidez: encontram-se, as representações apontadas pelas gestantes acerca da Consulta de Enfermagem no Pré-Natal, o que tem revelado a natureza do acolhimento à gestante, bem como as orientações dadas a esta, tanto para vivenciar bem o processo da gravidez, quanto para instruir-se sobre o planejamento familiar associado, principalmente aos métodos para o controle da gravidez. Eixo III - Cuidando do bebê: as gestantes, através de suas representações, revelam que os cuidados com o recém-nascido estão centrados no Modelo Biológico, nos princípios de higiene e de prevenção de doenças, para o seu crescimento e desenvolvimento, e o aleitamento materno, como uma prática importante para o bebê e a nutriz. Mesmo a Consulta de Enfermagem sendo representada como um espaço interativo e de acolhimento, faz-se necessário repensar o paradigma de uma consulta normativa, informativa e centrada no Modelo Biológico. Para tanto, deve ser enfocado, pelas enfermeiras, nas orientações à gestante sobre os cuidados com o pré-natal, o paradigma da integralidade. __________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTConsidered as {{an important}} moment of the woman´s life, the pregnancy sinthetizes the sum of ambivalent feelings: fear, cheerfulness and self fulfilment. Thinking {{about the importance of}} this event led me to reflect on the <b>nursing</b> <b>attendance</b> in pre natal process as the space the pregnant women have to express their necessities. This study aims at learning and analyzing the social representations of pregnant women attended in “Centro de Saúde N. 11 ” of Brasilia, about the <b>nursing</b> <b>attendance,</b> with the objective of offering subsidies {{to improve the quality of}} the assistance. The work primarily developed was the characterization of the profile of the pregnant women attended in the pre natal process of the year 2004, examining the attendance files. There were semi structured interviews with 13 pregnant women. In order to organize data, I applied the software ALCESTE, with the intention to learn from the collective speech and to identify the meaning shared by these women. The results of the lexical analyses showed that their speech were organized around three axes and six thematic classes which specifies: Axe I - living the pregnancy: shows the significative elements about the experience the women are living during their pregnancy, which makes possible to identify and understand how they notice they were pregnant as well as the biological and emotional changes. Axe II – Receiving orientations about the pregnancy: There are representations appointed by the pregnant women about the pre natal <b>nursing</b> <b>attendance</b> which reveals the nature of the attendance to the pregnant, as well as the orientations given to them, wether to experience well the pregnancy process, as well as to reveal the care of the associated family planning mainly for the methods of pregnancy control. Axe III – taking care of the baby: the pregnant women, through their representations reveal that the care provided to the newly born is centered in the biological model, in the principles of higiene and prevention of the diseases, for the growth and development, and the breast feeding, {{as an important}} practice for the baby and the mother. Even when the nursing consultation represented as an interactive and welcoming space it is necessary to rethink the paradigm of normative attendance which is informative and centered in the Biological Model. In order to achieve this end, the nurses should reinforce the paradigm of integrality along with the orientations to the pregnant women concerning the care which involves the pre natal process...|$|R

40|$|Background: Provision of {{appropriate}} analgesia for supraumbilical pyloromyotomy in infants {{is limited by}} concerns about sensitivity to opioids and other medication groups, due to immature metabolism. Local anesthetic infiltration and ultrasound guided rectus sheath blockade are two techniques commonly employed to provide perioperative analgesia. The aim of this review was to compare the quality of post-operative analgesia afforded by these two techniques. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart analysis of hospital records of all patients who underwent supraumbilical pyloromyotomy at a tertiary pediatric hospital between March 2009 and February 2011. Analysis of the anesthetic technique employed and post-operative acetaminophen requirements were performed. Additional information as to time to first post-operative feed, any complications and time of discharge from the hospital were collected by reviewing the <b>post-operative</b> <b>nursing</b> notes. Results: A total of 30 patients underwent supraumbilical pyloromyotomy during this period. A total of 18 received local anesthetic infiltration {{at the end of}} the procedure and 12 patients underwent ultrasound guided pre-incisional rectus sheath block for post-operative analgesia. Patients who had post-operative local anesthetic infiltration had a median (range) of 2 (1 - 3) doses of acetaminophen in the first 24 h. In the group of patients who received a rectus sheath block, the median (range) number of doses of acetaminophen in the first 24 h was also 2 (1 - 3). There were no differences in time to first feed and time to hospital discharge between the groups. The volume of local anesthetic administered was significantly smaller in the group receiving analgesia via rectus sheath block. Conclusion: Local anesthetic infiltration and pre-incisional ultrasound guided rectus sheath block provide similar degrees of post-operative analgesia. There were no differences between the two groups in time for first post-operative feed and time to hospital discharge...|$|R
60|$|His {{mother had}} been used to go to the public {{consultation}} on Saturday morning, when she could see the doctor for only a nominal sum. Her son went on the same day. The waiting-room was full of poor women, who sat patiently on a bench around the wall. Paul thought of his mother, in her little black costume, sitting waiting likewise. The doctor was late. The women all looked rather frightened. Paul asked the <b>nurse</b> in <b>attendance</b> if he could see the doctor immediately he came. It was arranged so. The women sitting patiently round the walls of the room eyed the young man curiously.|$|R

Cadets are assigned rotating leadership positions within the School Battalion and are evaluated on their performance and leadership abilities while in those positions. Third-year cadets practice briefing operations orders, executing small-unit tactics, leading and participating in physical training, and preparing for successful performance at the four-week Leader Development and Assessment Course during the summer following the third year. Under current regulations, unless the cadet is in the <b>Nursing</b> program, <b>attendance</b> at the course is mandatory (in the past, Ranger School was offered {{as an alternative to}} select cadets).|$|R
5000|$|The final episode, [...] "The Ghost Talks" [...] (actually {{released}} as the 21st to be filmed) contained extended flashbacks of Hopkirk alone solving a case—Jeff {{being out of}} town—before his death. This was necessitated by Mike Pratt having been injured in a fall from a drainpipe while {{trying to get into}} his locked flat. Pratt broke both his legs, rendering him bedridden in a real hospital bed (Pratt also had a <b>nurse</b> in <b>attendance)</b> on the set of a hospital room for duration of filming for that episode. Jeff's incapacity in the episode was explained by his having fallen off a balcony whilst in pursuit of a safe-cracker.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the evidence available in the literature about the perioperative care provided to women submitted to mastectomy. An integrative review of scientific literature conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, LILACS, and SciELO databases, published from 2000 to 2011, using the controlled descriptors: preoperative care; preoperative period; intraoperative care; intraoperative period; postoperative care; postoperative period; perioperative care; perioperative period; and mastectomy. The sample of this review consisted of seven articles. The evidence pointed as perioperative care of mastectomy the pharmacological management of pain in different surgical periods. Despite the difficulty in presenting a consensus of evidence for perioperative care of mastectomy, there was concern {{on the part of}} professionals to minimize/prevent pre-, intra- and <b>post-operative</b> pain. <b>Nursing</b> should be aware, both of the update of pharmacological treatments in pain management and the development of future research related to nursing care in the perioperative period of mastectomy...|$|R

Permanent evaluation and repeated assessment of the changing needs of the ill ensures the quality of provided care. There are many situations in children, where increased care concerning breath passages is needed. Bagassosis belongs also to these conditions. The research examination was realized through the quantitative method. On the basis of interviews and data analyses casuistry was worked out. The examination was performed in children who were admitted to hospital with laryngitis, bronchitis and asthma bronchiale. The aim of the thesis was {{to find out the}} specific features of <b>nursing</b> <b>attendance</b> in children with bagassosis. Three research questions were set for this aim. V 1 What treatment diagnosis occur in children with bagassosis? Through the research examination it was determined that in all observed children suffering from bagassosis, a similar nursing diagnosis was determined. In all children treatment diagnosis 00322 - Ineffective Breathing, 00095 Sleep Disorders and 00039 Risk of Aspiration occurred. V 2 What treatment intervention is used in children suffering from bagassosis? In all children with bagassosis treatment interventions are in accordance in some points. The choice of intervention is influenced by the type of ailment {{as well as by the}} children´s age. V 3 Are there any differences in the treatment of children with laryngitis, bronchitis and asthma bronchiale? On the basis of the research examination, it was determined that the treatment concerning children with these diseases is similar, but not the same, as each illness has its specific features. The results of this research examination can serve to nurses working at children´s wards to improve care in children with bagassosis...|$|R
