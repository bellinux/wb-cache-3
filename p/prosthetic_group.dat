25|$|Oxidation and {{reduction}} reactions are not common in organic chemistry as few organic molecules {{can act as}} oxidizing or reducing agents. Iron(II), on the other hand, can easily be oxidized to iron(III). This functionality is used in cytochromes, which function as electron-transfer vectors. The presence of the metal ion allows metalloenzymes to perform functions such as redox reactions that cannot easily be performed by the limited set of functional groups found in amino acids. The iron atom in most cytochromes is contained in a heme group. The differences between those cytochromes lies in the different side-chains. For instance cytochrome a has a heme a <b>prosthetic</b> <b>group</b> and cytochrome b has a heme b <b>prosthetic</b> <b>group.</b> These differences result in different Fe2+/Fe3+ redox potentials such that various cytochromes {{are involved in the}} mitochondrial electron transport chain.|$|E

The enzyme is a homodimer, located in the mitochondrial matrix. The enzyme is 750 amino acids long, with the a metal ligand binding region to bind to the Cobalt region of adenosylcobalamin.|$|E
25|$|Vanabins: Also {{known as}} {{vanadium}} chromagens, {{they are found}} in the blood of sea squirts. They were once hypothesized to use the rare metal vanadium as an oxygen binding <b>prosthetic</b> <b>group.</b> However, although they do contain vanadium by preference, they apparently bind little oxygen, and thus have some other function, which has not been elucidated (sea squirts also contain some hemoglobin). They may act as toxins.|$|E
2500|$|Organic cofactors are {{sometimes}} further divided into coenzymes and <b>prosthetic</b> <b>groups.</b> The term coenzyme refers specifically to enzymes and, as such, to the functional properties of a protein. On the other hand, [...] "prosthetic group" [...] emphasizes {{the nature of}} the binding of a cofactor to a protein (tight or covalent) and, thus, refers to a structural property. Different sources give slightly different definitions of coenzymes, cofactors, and <b>prosthetic</b> <b>groups.</b> Some consider tightly bound organic molecules as <b>prosthetic</b> <b>groups</b> and not as coenzymes, while others define all non-protein organic molecules needed for enzyme activity as coenzymes, and classify those that are tightly bound as coenzyme <b>prosthetic</b> <b>groups.</b> It should be noted that these terms are often used loosely.|$|R

25|$|In biochemistry, flavin adenine {{dinucleotide}} (FAD) is a redox cofactor, {{more specifically}} a <b>prosthetic</b> <b>group</b> of a protein, involved in several important enzymatic reactions in metabolism. A flavoprotein is a protein that contains a flavin moiety, this {{may be in the}} form of FAD or flavin mononucleotide (FMN). There are many flavoproteins besides components of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, including α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, some examples are shown in section 6.|$|E
25|$|Haemozoin is a {{disposal}} product {{formed from}} the digestion of blood by some blood-feeding parasites. These hematophagous organisms such as Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.), Rhodnius and Schistosoma digest haemoglobin and release high quantities of free heme, {{which is the}} non-protein component of hemoglobin. A heme is a <b>prosthetic</b> <b>group</b> that consists of an iron atom contained {{in the center of}} a heterocyclic porphyrin ring. Free heme is toxic to cells, so the parasites convert it into an insoluble crystalline form called hemozoin. In malaria parasites, hemozoin is often called malaria pigment.|$|E
25|$|All redox {{reactions}} {{take place}} in the hydrophilic domain of complex I. NADH initially binds to complex I, and transfers two electrons to the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) <b>prosthetic</b> <b>group</b> of the enzyme, creating FMNH2. The electron acceptor – the isoalloxazine ring – of FMN is identical to that of FAD. The electrons are then transferred through the FMN via a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, and finally to coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone). This electron flow changes the redox state of the protein, inducing conformational changes of the protein which alters the pK values of ionizable side chain, and causes four hydrogen ions to be pumped out of the mitochondrial matrix. Ubiquinone (CoQ) accepts two electrons to be reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2).|$|E

40|$|Objectives: αvβ 3 {{integrin}} is {{of great}} interest for tumor targeting because of its high concentration in tumor tissue. It recognizes ligands containing an arginine-glycine-aspartate motif (RGD), {{and a number of}} RGD-containing peptides have been developed as PET imaging probes of angiogenesis. We synthesized a series of 18 F-labeled cyclic-[RGDfK] peptides for in vivo imaging of αvβ 3 expression. Our F- 18 labeled <b>prosthetic</b> <b>groups</b> were attached to the αvβ 3 ligand via click chemistry, and the reaction conditions (time, temperature, solvent and pH) were optimized by using single modified amino acids. Methods: Seven amino acids were selected considering their different biochemical properties (polarity, total charge, presence of aromatic ring and heteroatom). All the amino acids were modified by the introduction of azido moiety to allow the interaction with alkyne <b>prosthetic</b> <b>groups.</b> Once the conditions of the click chemistry were optimized, the <b>prosthetic</b> <b>groups</b> were also coupled with the cyclic-[RGDfK] exhibiting an azido function. 4 - Trimethylammonium-nitrobenzene triflate was used as precursor for the radiosynthesis of the <b>prosthetic</b> <b>groups.</b> The fluorination was carried out with K 2 CO 3 /K 2. 2. 2 in CH 3 CN at 95 oC, and the nitro group was reduced with NaBH 4 and Pd/C in MeOH. The resulting 18 F-aniline was subsequently coupled to alkynoic acids to yield the final F- 18 labeled <b>prosthetic</b> <b>groups.</b> Finally, the <b>prosthetic</b> <b>groups</b> were attached to the peptides via Huisgen's cycloaddition. Figure 1. F- 18 labeled αvβ 3 ligand. Results: Our new <b>prosthetic</b> <b>groups</b> were successfully clicked to the modified amino acids and to the cyclic- [RGDfK], and the reactions were almost quantitative within 1 to 3. 5 h. The pH of the reaction did not influence the reaction kinetic and yield. The four steps of the F- 18 labeling were completely automated providing the final products in quantities and yields practical for PET imaging. IC 50 values of our ligands for αvβ 3 and α 5 β 1 demonstrated a high selectivity of our compounds towards αvβ 3, as well as the negligible effect of the <b>prosthetic</b> <b>groups</b> on the affinity of the ligand to its receptor, as confirmed by the prediction of the molecular modeling. Conclusions: We have successfully synthesized novel F- 18 labeled <b>prosthetic</b> <b>groups,</b> as well as novel PET imaging probes of αvβ 3 expression. The reaction conditions of the Huisgen's cycloaddition were optimized with selected modified amino acids, and subsequently transposed to the cyclic-[RGDfK] peptide. IC 50 data demonstrate that our 18 F-labeled ligands were selective for αvβ 3. In vivo microPET/CT studies in tumor bearing mice are underway...|$|R

25|$|Nonribosomal peptide {{synthesis}} occurs through distinct modules {{that can}} load {{and extend the}} protein by one amino acid through the amide bond formation at the contact sites of the activating domains. Each module typically consists of an adenylation (A) domain, a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain, and a condensation (C) or elongation domain. In the A domain, the specific amino acid is activated by converting into an aminoacyl adenylate enzyme complex attached to a 4'phosphopantetheine cofactor by thioesterification The complex is then transferred to the PCP domain with the expulsion of AMP. The PCP domain uses the attached 4'-phosphopantethein <b>prosthetic</b> <b>group</b> to load the growing peptide chain and their precursors. The organization of the modules necessary to biosynthesize Vancomycin is shown in Figure 1. In the biosynthesis of Vancomycin, additional modification domains are present, such as the epimerization (E) domain, which isomerizes the amino acid from one stereochemistry to another, and a thioesterase domain (TE) {{is used as a}} catalyst for cyclization and releases of the molecule via a thioesterase scission.|$|E
25|$|Organic cofactors {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} (typically a molecular mass less than 1000 Da) {{that can be}} either loosely or tightly bound to the enzyme and directly participate in the reaction. In the latter case, when {{it is difficult to}} remove without denaturing the enzyme, it can be called a <b>prosthetic</b> <b>group.</b> It is important to emphasize that there is no sharp division between loosely and tightly bound cofactors. Indeed, many such as NAD+ can be tightly bound in some enzymes, while it is loosely bound in others. Another example is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is tightly bound in transketolase or pyruvate decarboxylase, while it is less tightly bound in pyruvate dehydrogenase. Other coenzymes, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), biotin, and lipoamide, for instance, are covalently bound. Tightly bound cofactors are, in general, regenerated during the same reaction cycle, while loosely bound cofactors can be regenerated in a subsequent reaction catalyzed by a different enzyme. In the latter case, the cofactor can also be considered a substrate or cosubstrate.|$|E
500|$|The {{start of}} the reaction, and indeed of the entire {{electron}} chain, is the binding of a NADH molecule to complex I and the donation of two electrons. The electrons enter complex I via a <b>prosthetic</b> <b>group</b> attached to the complex, flavin mononucleotide (FMN). The addition of electrons to FMN converts it to its reduced form, FMNH2.

2500|$|A 1980 {{letter in}} Trends in Biochemistry Sciences noted the {{confusion}} in the literature and the essentially arbitrary distinction made between prosthetic groups and coenzymes group and proposed the following scheme.
