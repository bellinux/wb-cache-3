However, {{the science of}} intervention development remains at an early stage. We present a causal modelling approach to developing complex interventions for evaluation in randomized trials. In this approach a generic model links behavioural determinants, causally through behaviour, to physiological and biochemical variables, and health outcomes. It is tailored to context, target population, behaviours and health outcomes. The development of a specific causal model based on theory and evidence {{is illustrated by the}} <b>ProActive</b> <b>programme,</b> supporting increased physical activity among individuals at risk of Type 2 diabetes. The model provides a rational guide to appropriate measures, intervention points and intervention techniques, and can be tested quantitatively. Causal modelling is critically compared to other approaches to intervention development and evaluation, and research directions are indicated. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.

40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the major issues}} confronting the successful adoption and sustained use of online learning in higher education within the African Virtual University with reference to its own quality assurance context vis-à-vis that of the donor institution(s). It is argued that the four main issues which universities must deal with to achieve the maximum potential of online learning technologies are the establishment of cost-effective practices, the achievement and maintenance of quality in online learning/delivery, ensuring access and equity {{in the delivery of}} programmes, and establishing practices which can enable online learning to be sustained and to grow as mainstream activities within the process of university teaching and learning. While these issues are suggested as discrete entities, it is recognised that there is considerable overlap in the influencing factors and in the strategies and processes by which they can be overcome. In addition, the case describes and provides exemplars of a number of strategies for dealing with the issues in ways which provide the means to support and sustain quality online learning programmes within universities and also in the broader educational context. These include the development of <b>proactive</b> <b>programmes</b> to improve teacher expertise in the design, development and delivery of online teaching, the use of programmes to support and maintain student readiness, the need to provide adequate technology infrastructure to support the programmes, and the use of strategies supporting the design and development of online programmes based on the customisation and reuse of learning objects...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2010. This study {{explored}} learner {{experiences of}} school violence in a secondary school in Qacha’s Nek, Lesotho. The {{aim of the}} study was to understand learners’ experiences of violence as it happens in their school. Internationally, violence in schools is one of the most challenging issues facing educators and learners and school communities at large. The research design was a case study. The research method was the qualitative case study method. Data were collected through individual and focus group interviews with learners and document analysis. Fifteen learners participated in the study, 7 girls and 8 boys. The study found that learners are exposed to complex patterns of violence in the school, and these are experienced in multiple forms that affect learners in different ways. Some of the patterns of violence could be seen in enactments such as solving problems with aggression, violence from teachers, the discourse of blame, collective bullying. The study also found that in certain ways schooling itself can be viewed as violence in that the school had an ethos of authoritarianism and control. Violence in the form of corporal punishment, suspension and expulsion emerged as the most tangible symbol of an authoritarian school. The study also found that violence was a gendered phenomenon at the school. The study highlights the need for <b>proactive</b> <b>programmes</b> that are directed at the attaining goal of building school communities that are safe havens. The findings suggest that a key component of such programmes should be critical self-reflection and self-scrutiny by all members of the school community. In such a process teachers and learners would need to examine and challenge existing social attitudes, ideologies, norms, and injustices in school policies and practices...|$|R

It is being taught {{in one way or}} other in Geography and Geology departments in most of the universities at introductory level, but it is only a recent development that it is emerging as an independent branch and only few universities have started full-fledged course on GIS.

40|$|The four-area {{project was}} {{undertaken}} to further {{assess the impact}} of badger removal on the control of tuberculosis in cattle herds in Ireland. It was conducted between 1997 and 2002 in matched removal and reference areas in four counties, namely Cork, Donegal, Kilkenny and Monaghan, representing a wide range of Irish farming environments. In the removal areas, a <b>proactive</b> <b>programme</b> of badger removal was conducted, on two or three occasions each year, whereas in the reference areas, badger removal was entirely reactive following severe outbreaks of tuberculosis amongst cattle. A detailed statistical analysis of this study has already been presented by Griffin et al. [13]; this paper presents further, mainly descriptive, findings from the study. In total, 2, 360 badgers were captured in the removal areas of which 450 (19. 5 %) were considered positive for tuberculosis and 258 badgers were captured in the reference areas, with 57 (26. 1 %) positive for tuberculosis. The annual incidence of confirmed herd restrictions was lower in the removal area compared to the reference area in every year of the study period {{in each of the four}} counties. These empirical findings were consistent with the hazard ratios found by Griffin et al. [13]. Further, the effect of proactive badger removal on cattle tuberculosis in the four-area project and in the earlier east-Offaly project, as measured using the number of reactors per 1, 000 cattle tested, were very similar, providing compelling evidence of the role of badgers in the epidemiology of tuberculosis in Irish cattle herds. The validity of the four-area project was discussed in detail. Efforts to minimise badger-to-cattle transmission in Ireland must be undertaken in association with the current comprehensive control programme, which has effectively minimised opportunities for cattle-to-cattle transmission...|$|E
40|$|Predicting {{the spread}} of {{wildlife}} disease is critical for identifying populations at risk, targeting surveillance and designing <b>proactive</b> management <b>programmes.</b> We used a landscape genetics approach to identify landscape features that influenced gene flow {{and the distribution of}} chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Wisconsin white-tailed deer. CWD prevalence was negatively correlated with genetic differentiation of study area deer from deer in the area of disease origin (core-area). Genetic differentiation was greatest, and CWD prevalence lowest, in areas separated from the core-area by the Wisconsin River, indicating that this river reduced deer gene flow and probably disease spread. Features of the landscape that influence host dispersal and spatial patterns of disease can be identified based on host spatial genetic structure. Landscape genetics may be used to predict high-risk populations based on their genetic connection to infected populations and to target disease surveillance, control and preventative activities...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{roles of}} schools {{are more and}} more diverse, schools is no longer just an {{institution}} with instructive objectives, but an essential environment for socialization and acculturation. Of course, the instructive function of school is still important, but, at the same time, the school has the role to regulate the social behaviours, by educating the emotional responses and developing students’ social abilities. There are a wide range of theories who try to explain the recrudescence of aggressive behaviours in children. The underlying theory of this paper is that childhood aggression could be correlated with deficient information processing skills and social-emotional maladjustment. In many cases, disruptive behaviours are not just deviations from socials norms, but the expression of wrong behavioural models, hence a result of imitating and interiorizing undesirable behaviours through social learning. The role of the adults who represent significant, reference figures for the child (parents, teachers, specialists, etc.) have to be more then just passively observe, label the children behaviours as misconduct and apply the punishment; they have to be pro-actively involved in child's nurturing and education, promoting a supportive and formative environment, filled with opportunities of learning pro-social behaviours. There are plenty <b>proactive</b> <b>programmes</b> designed to create opportunities for harmonious development of children's personality, to enhance their pro-social behaviours repertoire. In this paper, we present the innovative process of adaptation and implementation of the program Making Choices into a Romanian school, as part of the national project CNMP 91 - 063 / 2007 Project, Social diagnosis of academic performances through Social School Success Scale (SSSS) and the design of research-validated intervention methods, project coordinated by Professor PhD. Maria Roth, from Babes-Bolyai University from Cluj Napoca, financed by Romanian Ministry of Education and Innovation. Making Choices is a curriculum containing a series of cognitive problem-solving lessons intended to broaden children's social knowledge and skills for successfully interacting with peers and adults. We conduct this research in a school in Romania, at secondary level. The conclusions will sustain the necessity to allocate resources in this type of pro-active, preventive, school-based program in order to promote social competence and to reduce both overt and social aggression of children...|$|R

Additionally, we explored whether specialised mental healthcare services were provided to parents presenting elevated levels of PTSD and depression reactions. Design: Cross-sectional survey, face-to-face interviews and questionnaires. Setting: Norway, aftermath of the Utøya massacre, 4 – 7 months postdisaster. Background: Following the Utøya massacre, <b>proactive</b> early outreach <b>programmes</b> were launched in all municipalities that were affected, facilitating access to appropriate healthcare services. Participants: A total of 453 parents of the Utøya survivors aged 13 – 33 years took part. Overall, 59. 8 % of the survivors were represented by one or more parent in our study. Main outcome measures: Engagement with the <b>proactive</b> early outreach <b>programme</b> (psychosocial crisis teams and contact persons in the municipalities), utilisation of healthcare services (general practitioner and specialised mental healthcare services) and mental distress (UCLA PTSD-RI and HSCL- 8). Results: A majority of the participants reported contact with the <b>proactive</b> early outreach <b>programme</b> (crisis team, 73. 9 %; and contact person, 73. 0 %). Failure of outreach to parents was significantly associated with non-intact family structure (crisis team: OR 1. 69, 95 % CI 1. 05 to 2. 72, p= 0. 032) and non-Norwegian origin (crisis team: OR 2. 39, 95 % CI 1. 14 to 4. 98, p= 0. 021). Gender of the parent was not significantly associated with failure of the outreach programme (p≥ 0. 075). Provision of specialised mental healthcare services was significantly associated with higher levels of PTSD (OR 2. 08, 95 % CI 1. 55 to 2. 79, p< 0. 001) and depression (OR 2. 42, 95 % CI 1. 71 to 3. 43, p< 0. 001) and not with the sociodemography (p≥ 0. 122). Conclusions: Proactive early outreach strategies may be helpful in identifying healthcare needs and facilitating access to the required services in a population struck by disaster.

40|$|During the {{apartheid}} era in South Africa {{there was an}} unequivocal commitment to white supremacy, segregation and inequality. Discrimination {{but not on the}} basis of race was entrenched by the pre-democratic government. The 1980 ‟s saw the first steps towards reversing such practices through various measures, in the form of formal equality. Formal equality holds that the state must be act neutrally in relation to its employees and must favour no one above another. It assumes that all people are equal and that inequality can be eradicated simply by treating all people in the same way. Formal equality is therefore blind to structural inequality. Substantive equality in contrast to formal equality holds the value that equality is not simply a matter of likeness, that those who are different should be treated differently. The very essence of equality is to make distinction between groups and individual in order to accommodate their different needs and interests. It considers discrimination against groups which have been historically advantaged to be qualitatively aimed at remedying that disadvantage. The Constitution Act 108 of 1996 confers the right to equal protection and benefit of the law and the right to non discrimination. Prohibition of unfair discrimination in itself is insufficient to achieve true equality in a historically oppressed society. Hard affirmative action measures are required, the Constitution further explicitly endorses such restitutionary measures. Affirmative action is a systematic, planned process whereby the effects of colonialism and racial discrimination are being reversed in all areas if life. It is designed to achieve equal employment opportunities. In order to achieve this goal the barriers of the workplace which restrict employment and progressive opportunities have to be systematically eliminated through <b>proactive</b> <b>programmes.</b> Affirmative action is a delicate instrument of social engineering which must be used with caution. The Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998 gives effect to the constitutional provisions and to regulate affirmative action measures in employment. The Employment Equity Act spells out the beneficiaries, who should do the protection, and advancement and what may happen to employers if they fail to comply in the view of the Director-General of the Labour. However the explicit constitutional and legislative endorsement of affirmative action comes with its controversy and legal challenges and it has been left to the courts to resolve tension on the one hand and to ensure equal treatment on the other.

40|$|A {{performance}} specified {{maintenance contract}} (PSMC) is a medium to long term maintenance contract running typically over a 10 year period. The contract covers {{all aspects of}} road network maintenance activity including day to day maintenance, resurfacing and reconstruction costs. The PSMC contract is based around the contractor meeting various performance standards {{in return for a}} lump sum amount. This paper illustrates the benefits of a PSMC style asset maintenance solution in managing a network such as that proposed in the Challenge. A PSMC maintenance solution offers benefits to the road maintenance authority through the ability of the Contractor to programme work at the optimum time, rather than being constrained to relatively even annual budgets. In this paper, a 15 % saving was predicted over the 20 year analysis period with no loss of level of service, through the ability to fund maintenance works in a more optimal fashion. This paper concludes that PSMC contracts offer an attractive asset maintenance solution. The lump sum contract price also provides greater certainty of long term expenditure levels than a more traditional year by year approach. There are further benefits of PSMC contracts which are not addressed as part of this paper such as economies of scale, certainty of work efficiencies, quality drivers on the Contractor to “do it right first time ” and <b>proactive</b> maintenance <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

Their role, however, in partnership approaches to crime control in entertainment districts is not well understood. In this paper, we explore how a police-led partnership (the Liquor Enforcement and <b>Proactive</b> Strategies <b>programme</b> – LEAPS) shaped licensed venue managers 2 ̆ 7 and owners 2 ̆ 7 (whom we refer to as ‘place managers’) perceptions of crime and disorder and how LEAPS then activates place managers to take some responsibility for controlling crime and disorder problems. Using a survey of the population of place managers in an entertainment district in Brisbane, Australia before and after the implementation of LEAPS, our study reveals that place managers perceived a decrease in drug use, prostitution and chroming, yet perceptions of the incidence of underage drinking, social disorder and fighting increased. Results also show an increase in the number of self-reported proactive behaviours taken by place managers who considered illicit and licit drugs to be a problem. Results suggest that the role of place managers is instrumental for enhancing police responses to drug and alcohol problems in entertainment districts. We conclude that LEAPS officers are well placed to co-opt place managers into taking further responsibility for crime problems in and around their drinking establishments...|$|R

40|$|Background : Recently, {{we found}} a telephone-delivered {{secondary}} prevention programme using health coaching (‘ProActive Heart’) {{to be effective in}} improving a range of key behavioural outcomes for myocardial infarction (MI) patients. What remains unclear, however, {{is the extent to which}} these treatment effects translate to important psychological outcomes such as depression and anxiety outcomes, an issue of clinical significance due to the substantial proportion of MI patients who experience depression and anxiety. The objective of the study was to investigate, as a secondary hypothesis of a larger trial, the effects of a telephone-delivered health coaching programme on depression and anxiety outcomes of MI patients. Design : Two-arm, parallel-group, randomized, controlled design with six-months outcomes. Methods : Patients admitted to one of two tertiary hospitals in Brisbane, Australia following MI were assessed for eligibility. Four hundred and thirty patients were recruited and randomly assigned to usual care or an intervention group comprising up to 10 telephone-delivered ‘health coaching’ sessions (ProActive Heart). Regression analysis compared Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores of completing participants at six months (intervention: n = 141 versus usual care: n = 156). Results : The intervention yielded reductions in anxiety at follow-up (mean difference = - 0. 7, 95 % confidence interval=- 1. 4,- 0. 02) compared with usual care. A similar pattern was observed in mean depression scores but was not statistically significant. Conclusions : The <b>ProActive</b> Heart <b>programme</b> effectively improves anxiety outcomes of patients following myocardial infarction. If combined with psychological-specific treatment, this programme could impact anxiety of greater intensity in a clinically meaningful way. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Field hockey in New Zealand is gender {{balanced}} {{in terms of}} numbers of female and male participants, but gender biased towards males, in terms of coaching appointments. The trend towards men increasingly dominating leadership positions in elite women's coaching, {{has been the focus}} of concerned feminist researchers for over a decade. This current study examined the early roots of field hockey history in New Zealand, noted the trend towards hegemonic male domination of coaching roles, and sought to elucidate the roles and qualities of actual elite coaches and, in particular, examine the impact of gender on the stage of elite women's field hockey. The elite level of competition, familiar to the researcher as a past field hockey international player, has been defined as one that occurs at the highest internal national (usually provincial), or international (test) levels, of sport. It is within this elite sporting setting that the impact of gender has been studied in the present research, whereby gender is viewed as a socially constructed concept, based on culturally reinforced images of masculinity and femininity, as expressed by accepted traits, roles and qualities. A variety of qualitative methods was used, each underpinned with the basal intention of capturing participant voices and portraying images of perceived realities as they emerged from a variety of scenes, including matches, team meetings, warm-ups and post-match evaluations. The study concentrated on three provincial women's teams over a period spanning three years. Participant images were also captured from observations with the New Zealand women's hockey team during their build up to World Cup in Holland in 1998. Furthermore, interviews with provincial women's hockey coaches, and a questionnaire of provincial hockey players, added further data for analysis. Integral to the research process was the systematic critical reflection of the researcher, her chief supervisor, and main subjects of the study. Participant observation, semi-structured coach interviews, and player questionnaires generated data from a variety of research settings. These data were subjected to grounded theory analysis to create a master list of categories and properties that, in turn, generated theoretical propositions about coach roles, coach qualities, the impact of gender, and coach development. The theoretical propositions became the basis of a model explicating the impact of gender on the setting of elite women' field hockey. Critical to this model were the three realms of administrators, coaches, and players. Interactions between each realm were perceived by the researcher as occurring through a centrally placed 'gender archetype' proposed as a domain of social field moderation. The degree to which the archetype impacted on each setting varied, according to societal and individual perceptions of gender. Critical gender issues were raised through this study in terms of men coaching women at the elite level. These were especially noted in terms of: gendered beliefs and attitudes, physical myths and realities, confidence and competence, and sex and sexuality. Significant aspects of this research's findings included: the large number of roles undertaken by elite women's hockey coaches; the prime importance of communication and leadership in terms of both roles and qualities; and the lack of support mechanisms utilised by, and provided for, coaches. The study noted the difficulties associated with recruitment and retention of women in elite roles and highlighted the need for administrators to develop <b>proactive</b> <b>programmes</b> to foster women in such roles, and to educate men committed to women's hockey, about gender issues raised in this study...|$|R

The overall cessation rates that were yielded by a brief protocol including booster sessions were equivalent to those obtained with the American Cancer Society’s standard protocol with boosters. Conclusions: Based on these findings, the abbreviated protocol with five sessions and two boosters is considered to be an option for improving cost efficiency in the delivery of this service. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} and learning needs of parents with toddlers Knowledge and insight regarding {{the child and}} his/her particular developmental phase improve the prospects of a successful parentchild relationship. This prerequisite {{is considered to be}} a proactive approach to parenthood. Proactive parents with the necessary insight and knowledge are more capable of anticipating the possible nature of their children’s behavioural phases and seek ways and means to satisfy their children’s needs in an appropriate manner. Parents are, however, often ignorant or confused regarding their children’s behaviour. They may thus express the need for knowledge from a perspective that can be reconciled with their particular view of reality. This article reports on an investigation into the knowledge needs of Christian parents with toddlers. In order to reach this aim applied research was undertaken by means of the method of intervention research. Data collection was done through focus group interviews; subsquently these data were analysed by means of descriptive analysis as described by Tesch. The principles and topics identified as a result of the analysis are discussed and the article ends with conclusions regarding the possible design of a <b>proactive</b> parent guidance <b>programme</b> for Christian parents with toddlers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Swaziland {{has made}} great {{progress}} towards {{its goal of}} malaria elimination by 2015. However, malaria importation from neighbouring high-endemic Mozambique through Swaziland&# 8217;s eastern border remains a major factor that could prevent elimination from being achieved. In order to reach elimination, Swaziland must rapidly identify and treat imported malaria cases before onward transmission occurs. 				 				 					 						Methods 					A nationwide formative assessment was conducted over eight weeks {{to determine if the}} imported cases of malaria identified by the Swaziland National Malaria Control Programme could be linked to broader social networks and to explore methods to access these networks. 				 				 					 						Results 					Using a structured format, interviews were carried out with malaria surveillance agents (6), health providers (10), previously identified imported malaria cases (19) and people belonging to the networks identified through these interviews (25). Most imported malaria cases were Mozambicans (63 %, 12 / 19) making a living in Swaziland and sustaining their families in Mozambique. The majority of imported cases (73 %, 14 / 19) were labourers and self-employed contractors who travelled frequently to Mozambique to visit their families and conduct business. Social networks of imported cases with similar travel patterns were identified through these interviews. Nearly all imported cases (89 %, 17 / 19) were willing to share contact information to enable network members to be interviewed. Interviews of network members and key informants revealed common congregation points, such as the urban market places in Manzini and Malkerns, as well as certain bus stations, where people with similar travel patterns and malaria risk behaviours could be located and tested for malaria. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					This study demonstrated that imported cases of malaria belonged to networks of people with similar travel patterns. This study may provide novel methods for screening high-risk groups of travellers using both snowball sampling and time-location sampling of networks to identify and treat additional malaria cases. Implementation of a <b>proactive</b> screening <b>programme</b> of importation networks may help Swaziland halt transmission and achieve malaria elimination by 2015...|$|R
40|$|Transition to {{university}} takes {{place during the}} first few months of a student entering higher education and is characterised by the new academic, social and personal challenges that the student experiences. At university, students are required to develop competences related to accessing information, participation in university life, facing academic challenges, study, and work abroad (IUQB, 2006; Diggins, Risquez and Murphy et al., 2011; DES, 2011). In Ireland, the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 (DES, 2011) advises higher education institutions to address identified shortfalls in students’ skills during their first year in higher education, by providing induction and preparation courses such as self-directed learning, time management and information literacy. This chapter showcases an example of the practical application of this policy through the First Seven Weeks programme at the University of Limerick (UL), a <b>proactive</b> transition <b>programme</b> underpinned by research, which integrates existing on-campus student support services. Using Facebook, a free social networking website, as the main method of communication, the initiative aims to help students find their way around, clarify expectations, and facilitate their academic adjustment and socialisation. The findings show that students of the programme agree that Facebook is useful for university student support initiatives and that the programme is an extremely helpful resource. The programme is sustainable in terms of funding, as the cost-benefit is maximised through engaging with existing student services, staff, faculty and students; it is further sustainable by using Facebook, a free social networking website, as the main communication method with students. However, it is clear that guidance initiatives are intensive from the point of view of coordination and require adequate funding as well as the strategic support of university authorities. The following sections explore the context for the programme and the use of technology within the programme. We then discuss the results collected from two online surveys and conclude by outlining proposed future developments...|$|R
40|$|In loco intellegentia: {{human factors}} {{for the future}} European train driver The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) {{represents}} a step change in technology for rail operations in Europe. It comprises track-to-train communications and intelligent on-board systems providing an unprecedented degree of support to the train driver. ERTMS is designed to improve safety, capacity and performance, as well as facilitating interoperability across the European rail network. In many ways, particularly from the human factors perspective, ERTMS has parallels with automation concepts in the aviation and automotive industries. Lessons learned from both these industries are that such technology raises a number of human factors issues associated with train driving and operations. The interaction amongst intelligent agents throughout the system must be effectively coordinated {{to ensure that the}} strategic benefits of ERTMS are realised. The present paper discusses the psychology behind some of these key issues, such as mental workload, interface design, user information requirements, transitions and migration, and communications. Relevant experience in aviation and vehicle automation is drawn upon to give an overview of the human factors challenges facing the UK rail industry in implementing ERTMS technology. By anticipating and defining these challenges before the technology is implemented, it is hoped that a <b>proactive</b> and structured <b>programme</b> of research can be planned to meet them...|$|R

40|$|Retailers are {{beginning}} {{to accept responsibility for}} the environmental impacts of their product supply chains. This paper: (i) summarises the challenges faced by retailers to drive environmental improvement across private-label food, textile, furniture and household chemical products; (ii) provides a review of 25 major European retailers' best practice actions. Retailers drive environmental improvement of supply chains using third party environmental certification (e. g. Forest Stewardship Council), product performance labelling, environmental requirements for suppliers, supplier improvement <b>programmes.</b> <b>Proactive</b> retailers go beyond product labeling to use widespread product certification and extensive collaboration with suppliers to drive systematic environmental improvement across product groups associated with high environmental burdens. Quantitative data on sales shares of improved products are patchy but indicate large variations in performance across retailers. Specialist retailers and smaller cooperative retailers tend to be frontrunners in supply chain improvement, whilst very large and price-led grocery retailers tend to be laggards. These differences partly reflect logistical and market positioning difficulties for the latter types of retailer to shift towards sustainable sourcing, but also different perspectives on responsibility. Frontrunner retailers accept a high degree of responsibility for supply chain sustainability compared with laggard retailers who tend to place the onus on consumers to drive environmental improvement across supply chains.
