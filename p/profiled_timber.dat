40|$|Due {{to their}} efficiency, lightweight, ease of {{erection}} and low cost, steel and aluminium thin-walled structures {{have become very}} popular {{in the construction industry}} over the past few decades. Applications include roof and wall systems (purlins and girts), storage racks, and composite concrete and steel slabs. The effectiveness of these structures lies in the cross-sectional shape of the profiles which enhances their strength by controlling the three fundamental buckling modes: local, distortional, and global. However, despite the attractiveness of these structures, steel and aluminium are greenhouse gas intensive materials and do not produce sustainable structural products. This paper presents an investigation performed at the Griffith School of Engineering, Griffith University, which shows manufacturing these types of <b>profiles</b> in <b>timber</b> is possible. Short composite thinwalled timber Cee-sections (500 mm long) were fabricated by gluing together thin softwood (Araucaria cunninghamii) veneers (1 mm thick). Two types of Ceesections were considered, one with a web stiffener to increase the local buckling capacity of the profile and one without. The profiles were tested in compression and the test results are presented and discussed in the paper in terms of structural behaviour and performance.

All engineered <b>profiles</b> comprised solid <b>timber</b> or LVL flanges and three-ply plywood webs. The number of webs varied from one to four. The beams had an overall depth of 290 mm and were either 88 mm or 106 mm wide.

To enable a realistic analysis, 12 beams were replicated for each design. The individual components of the beams were tested prior to assembly to obtain the modulus of elasticity and shear modulus and were grouped to provide an even distribution of the material properties. The addition of extra webs to the I-beam profile significantly enhanced the bending and shear capacity of the beam while maintaining a high strength to weight ratio. The boxed I-beam proved to be the most efficient to manufacture and displayed superior structural performance compared {{with the rest of the}} profiles in terms of flexural stiffness and bending and shear capacity.

40|$|Among the {{different}} testing techniques for timber structures, the common tests {{are based on}} slightly destructive methods which provide results of qualitative order. The resistance drilling tests, for example, are able to detect the decayed areas of the material. Nevertheless, {{the interpretation of the}} results is influenced by several factors: the correct execution of the test and the estimation of the damage, according to the comparison between decayed and non-decayed areas, supposed to be representative of a sane condition of the structure. Other testing methods for timber structures are very close to sclerometric tests, but the penetrometric tests allow a more effective control on the wooden element for interpreting the decay problems. The penetrometric tests, carried out through resistographic devices, provide a profile represented in a amplitude vs drilling depth graph. This result does not allow a direct correlation between the recorded amplitude and the density of the material. After several on-site applications of the resistographic tests, the authors carried out some laboratory tests trying to use the measured amplitude as a key-parameter for supporting the final interpretation of the data. During the tests performed in laboratory at fixed environmental conditions, a preliminary estimation through densiometric profiles of the density levels obtained for some specific wood categories was identified.

40|$|The FLEGT (Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade) {{regulations}} {{were introduced in}} 2003 {{with the intention of}} reversing the rate of destruction of the world’s forests. One of the European Union’s aims is to halt the import of illegally acquired and endangered timber. The timber trade law (regulation (EU) 995 / 2010) stipulates that importers of tropical timber must be able to identify the origin of timber used in their products, and from the 3 rd March 2013, it is a criminal offence to sell endangered timber in the European Union without a FLEGT licence. There are few analytical methods available to determine the declared origin of timber. The current procedure involves checking of shipping documents and visual checks of common timber species for origin identification. In this project, one hundred timber core samples of Sapele (Entandrophragma), Rosewood (Dalbergia) and Ebony (Diospyros) trees were taken from across West Africa and Madagascar. The δ 2 H, δ 13 C, and δ 18 O isotopes of the extracted cellulose were determined by using an elemental analyser coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS). The study revealed that δ 2 H and δ 18 O of cellulose showed no correlation with δ 2 H and δ 18 O of precipitation water, suggesting the leaf-to-air-vapour pressure difference (VPD), as well as alternative ground water sources may influence the isotopes laid down in cellulose of tropical <b>timber.</b> Additionally, multi-element <b>profiles</b> of the <b>timber</b> samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), to assess the potential for geographical origin discrimination based on the combined profile of stable isotope ratios and multi-element concentrations.

40|$|The {{community}} forest is increasingly {{seen as an}} alternative to industrial forestry for its perceived potential to mitigate conflict in forest resource management and planning. Theoretically, a community-based approach affords the chance to assert local values, provide local benefits, and manage resources differently than established top-down approaches. Yet practical examples of {{community forest}} initiatives in Canada reveal a host of constraints. This research uses a multiple case study design to investigate the motivations for and challenges to implementing community forests in British Columbia, Canada. Observations are drawn from four case studies (Denman Island, Malcolm Island, Cortes Island, and Creston) in order to consider implementation as an ongoing and dynamic process. Site visits and semi-structured interviews with community forest stakeholders were conducted in June 2005. Based on a synthesis of the community-based resource management and implementation literature, the analysis uses a systems approach to identify challenges at multiple spatial and temporal scales to examine the complexity of cross-scale interactions. The study outlines a sequence of process stages and associated challenges that are critical to developing successful community forests. In addition to unique, context-specific challenges, results show that low local support and awareness, low First Nations support, difficulty reaching consensus, lack of human and physical resources, poor forest health and <b>timber</b> <b>profiles,</b> weak senior government support, resistance from the industrial/scientific forestry paradigm, and competition for land and forest tenure are common challenges. Results confirm that the primary motivation for community forestry is local control of resources for local benefits; however, local development pressure is also an impetus for increasing control. This reveals a key difference between communities where forests are important {{from the standpoint of the}} traditional forest-industry compact versus those where forests are important for lifestyle and tourism. Given the range of critical challenges involved, communities pursuing community forestry must be sure of their intentions and they must be sure that community forestry is truly the appropriate route to achieving local goals...|$|R

Technical improvements, including {{the replacement of the}} receiver multiplexer >. / 4 cable by a passive circuit; an active shim of the magnet; and the design and build of new gradient amplifiers, lead to increased portability of the system, improved homogeneity of the magnet and overall to a doubling of the signal to noise ratio of measured signals. Second, the feasibility of imaging living trees in the forest using the Tree Hugger is demonstrated. The first extended in-situ magnetic resonance imaging study of a living tree over a growing season is reported. Correlations are drawn between nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and other indicators such as relative humidity, soil moisture and net solar radiation. The third part of the work is a. study of water self-diffusion in a living tree in-situ and in felled timber made using the Tree Hugger.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was conducted with the view of obtaining baseline information {{on the use of}} polyethylene glycol (PEG) on Tasmanian Oak for the purpose of improving the quality of the seasoned structural timber product. Tasmanian Oak is the marketing name for a triad of Tasmanian-grown eucalypt species (E. delegatensis, E. obliqua, and E. regnans). Incubation of freshly-milled timber in aqueous PEG solutions prior to seasoning follows on from investigations in northern hemispheric timber species such as hoop pine and spruce {{in the middle of the}} 20 th Century. PEG penetrates freshly sawn Tasmanian Oak in a manner which is considerate of incubation time, temperature, PEG molecular weight/size and timber density. Histological examination indicated that PEG penetrated completely throughout the structure of the wood substance in three orientations (transverse, radial and tangential). During air-drying of PEG soaked timber, further migration of PEG into Tasmanian Oak is negligible. The rate of moisture content loss in Tasmanian Oak was shown to be retarded by PEG pre-treatment although the ability to prevent moisture loss was not concomitant with dimensional stability. An investigation to explain the change in rate of moisture loss examined effects on the thermodynamic property, water activity. Results indicated that a change in solution water activity could partly expain changes in the rate of moisture content loss, but more research is required to better divine this relationship. Shrinkage in Tasmanian Oak was reduced after treatment with aqueous PEG 400 solutions at or above 30 % (v/v), with a greater percentage reduction in tangential shrinkage compared to reduction in radial shrinkage. This is significant as backsawn (a. k. a. flatsawn) timber, with its broader tangential face, was in particular focus. The reduction in shrinkage was consistent with PEG concentration in the incubating medium. A decrease in the formation of drying defect, such as surface and internal checking accompanied the improvement in keeping sawn dimensions. Backsawn Tasmanian Oak obtained from young trees (less than 20 years) from plantation resource presents a challenging <b>profile</b> for commercial <b>timber</b> drying and will become more prevalent as the logging of old-growth forests is phased out. Timber seasoners may be faced with options of longer drying times or lower yields due to drying defect unless a method can be developed to provide added protection to the sawn timber product during drying. At this stage, pre-treatment of Tasmanian Oak with PEG shows the hallmarks of providing a solution to this emerging dilemma...|$|R

The aim to observe this profile {{is to get the}} information whether this <b>profile</b> could replace <b>timber</b> as a house roof frame or not. This profile was observed in three different conditions. The first condition is analyzing the profile without any stiffener plate attach. The second condition is by attaching one diaphragm plate on the middle of the HS- 75 beam, and the last observed object is a HS- 75 beam with three diaphragm plate attach on certain places along the beam. The modeling and simulation of HS- 75 is important to predict the actual strength or some other properties such as strain, deflection or deformation. In this study, strength analysis of HS- 75 is simulated using finite element method (FEM). The profile strength analysis is simulated on three different combinations of diaphragm plate commonly designed for house roof frame. The HS- 75 being analyzed is the beam total deformation. The first step in preparing the simulation is producing the HS- 75 product using the Ansys workbench software. Some HS- 75 properties should also be attached, such as the Young modulus, the Poison Ratio and the Tensile Ultimate Strength value. The HS- 75 beam being simulated has a length of 1800 mm, and a plate thickness of 0. 08 mm. The second step is dividing the beam in small part as meshing of the beam. The next step is attaching the loads work out on the beam. The last process is simulating the product by analyzing the directional deformation and the total deformation. FEM static stress analysis is also simulated on three different beam conditions. The results showed that the greater the load given to a light steel beam, then the deflection that occurs will also be greater. Based on the type of treatment conditions on HS- 75 light steel {{it was found that the}} deflection occurs at a maximum load of 6500 N is 14. 346 mm (without diaphragm plate), 6. 5094 mm (one diaphragm plate attached) and 6. 159 mm (three diaphragm plates attached). It can be concluded that the HS- 75 light steel profile which uses three diaphragm plates has a greater strength compared to the light steel profiles using one diaphragm plate and light steel profile without a diaphragm plate. This methodology serves as a novel approach for HS- 75 design evaluation, and the study of beam stress behavior in profiles which is needed in home properties industrie...|$|R
