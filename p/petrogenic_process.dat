40|$|A {{study of}} {{relationships}} between basic and acidic rocks was made by fractionating primitive basalt at low pressure anhydrous conditions at various fugacities. Fractionally crystallized basalt became increasingly enriched in iron which became silicate liquid immiscible, producing Fe-enriched basaltic and granitic liquids. The latter is similar to plagiogranites found in mid-oceanic rift (MOR) regions, showing that silicate liquid immiscibility could be the <b>petrogenic</b> <b>process</b> which produces plagiogranites in some MOR regions and ophiolites. The major problem in considering plagiogranites as products of silicate liquid immiscibility is absence of any description of the Fe-enriched conjugate liquid in the ophiolite or MOR literature, and the identification of this magma is essential for a definite case of silicate liquid immiscibility...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-five surface {{sediment}} {{samples were}} collected from Meiliang Bay, Taihu Lake, China, in 2003. The concentrations of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), identified as priority pollutants by the USEPA, were determined by gas chromatography equipped with a mass spectrometry detector (GC-MS). Total concentrations of the PAHs ranged from 1207 to 4754 ng/g dry weight. Sediment samples with the highest PAH concentrations were from the northern site of the bay, which is in proximity to the incoming PAH source; the PAH levels {{in the southern part}} were relatively low. The observed PAH levels were higher than those in river sediments in China but were lower than those found in sediments of urban areas and harbors. According to the observed molecular indices, PAHs originated largely from the high-temperature pyrolytic process, whereas the <b>petrogenic</b> <b>process</b> was more commonly responsible for PAH contamination in harbors. A good correlation existed between the benzo[a]pyrene level and the total PAH concentration (r= 0. 97), making benzo[a]pyrene a potential molecular marker for PAH pollution. According to the numerical effect-based sediment quality guideline (SQGs) of the United States, the levels of PAHs at most studied sites in Meiliang Bay, except some sites {{in the northern part of}} the bay, should not exert adverse biological effects. In the northern part of the bay, the PAH levels at sites 21 and 22 exceed the effects range low (ERL) and could thus cause acute biological impairments, in comparison with the sediment quality guidelines. The total PAH levels were expressed as the B[a]P toxicity equivalents (TEQs(carc)) and compared to the contaminated sediments from Guba Pechenga, Barents Sea, Russia. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Crude oil is {{composed}} of more than 17,000 compounds. Among these 17,000 compounds are PAHs, which are considered the most toxic components of oil. PAHs are formed by pyrogenic and <b>petrogenic</b> <b>processes.</b> <b>Petrogenic</b> PAHs are formed by the elevated pressure of organic material. In contrast, pyrogenic PAHs are formed through the incomplete combustion of organic material. Crude oil naturally contains petrogenic PAHs and these PAH levels are increased significantly through the burning of oil which creates pyrogenic PAHs. The level of PAHs found in crude oil differs {{with the type of}} crude oil. For example, crude oil from the Exxon Valdez oil spill had PAH concentrations of 1.47%, while PAH concentrations from the North Sea have much lower PAH concentrations of 0.83%.|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial analog {{studies of}} the phase {{petrology}} of supercooled melts and rapid crystal growth are reviewed for possible light shed on lunar crystallization, supercooling, and <b>petrogenic</b> <b>processes,</b> in particular rapid consolidation of lavas extruded on the lunar surface, and impact liquids. Crystallization of major constituent minerals (olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase) in dendritic or skeletal forms is found much more characteristic of lunar igneous rocks than of terrestrial counterparts. Olivine and pyroxene occur often as skeletal phenocrysts, and their stage of crystallization {{is crucial to the}} genesis and cooling history of porphyritic lavas. Widespread occurrence of glass and of immature radiate crystallization, particularly of highly zoned pyroxenes and zoned plagioclase, is noted...|$|R
40|$|Hydrocarbon {{contaminants}} in foods can be grouped into two main classes, {{based on the}} main process involved in their formation. The first class of contaminants is represented by mineral oil hydrocarbons, which include both saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons (mainly alkylated), originating from <b>petrogenic</b> <b>processes.</b> The other class of compounds originates from incomplete pyrogenic processes and comprises parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with 2 - 6 rings. The contamination with these compounds can occur at any stage of food production, namely from field environmental contamination, farming practices, food transformation processes (industrial and domestic), and migration from packaging materials. Although these contaminants are very similar from a chemical {{point of view and}} as far as some analytical issues are concerned, sample preparation and the final analytical determination applied are very specific. In this review the two classes of contaminants will be discussed separately, considering not only the analytical approach but also their source of contamination, toxicity and legislation issues...|$|R
40|$|The Beni Bousera ultramafic massif is a tectonically emplaced body {{of upper}} mantle {{material}} that is exposed over 72 km 2 in the Betic-Rif-Tell orogenic belt of northern Morocco. The massif is composed primarily of spinel lherzolite, although meter-scale domains of harzburgite, dunite, and veins and layers of pyroxenite are relatively common. A combined field and laboratory-based investigation of Beni Bousera has yielded a new dataset comprised of whole rock and mineral chemistry data {{that is used to}} suggest the massif is more heterogeneous than previously interpreted, and that "secondary " peridotites and dunites were formed by different <b>petrogenic</b> <b>processes</b> than the remainder of the massif. Trends in the CaO-MgO-Al 203 -SiO 2 system and trace element patterns suggest partial melting of the peridotite {{played a significant role in}} the evolution of the massif, as has been previously suggested for other orogenic peridotites.

5000|$|The {{source of}} the Parinacota magmas is {{ultimately}} the mantle wedge above the slab of the Nazca Plate. Fluids released from the slab flux the wedge and trigger the formation of melts, {{with the assistance of}} asthenospheric material that is hotter and gets transported into the wedge. These ascending magmas then interact with the crust, resulting in extensive changes to their composition. The area in the crust where such interaction takes place is known as [...] "MASH" [...] or [...] "Melting Assimilation Storage Homogenization", and it is there where the base magmas are formed which then enter into shallow magmatic systems. Further, the relative thickness of the crust and narrowness of the mantle wedge mean that garnet is stable within the wedge, causing the magmas to be influenced by garnet-linked <b>petrogenic</b> <b>processes.</b> Shallower crustal components such as the locally extensive Lauca-Perez ignimbrite may have been assimilated by Parinacota as well. These crustal components contributed about 12% of the primitive magmas as erupted by the Ajata cones, while the mantle wedge contributed 83%. Fluids from the slab and sediments subducted in the Peru-Chile Trench added the remaining 3 and 2%.|$|R
30|$|The {{concentration}} of PAH metabolites {{in the fish}} {{was influenced by the}} different types of areas: the open sea (Boujdour) is not really polluted [40]; what appears plausible. The lagoon, as a semi-closed environment (Moulay Bousselham lagoon) presents a higher contamination than the open sea because of its lower water exchange. Here, pollutants are easily accumulated [35]. 1 -OH-Pyr is invariably the major metabolite present in the bile of fish exposed to PAH contamination of sediments [41, 42], which was confirmed by our results. Pyrene is produced by many pyrolytic and <b>petrogenic</b> <b>processes</b> [43]. It is regarded the best general indicator of PAH exposure in fish [44, 45]. Although pyrene is an extremely widespread and common contaminant, the presence of other PAH metabolites in fish bile can provide additional information about the possible origin of parent compounds. In accordance with Kammann et al. [34] and Ruddock et al. [46], 1 -OH-Pyr was found to be the dominant compound in eel bile. Comparing {{the results of the present}} study to similar investigations from several European countries, it is shown that the means of both PAH metabolite concentrations in eels from the different countries are higher compared to concentrations found in eels in the present study (Fig.  2). The studies cited in Fig.  2 cover the European eels caught in rivers, lakes and lagoons.|$|R

Heterogeneous zones - regions throughout the massif with diverse groups of peridotites and pyroxenites - are believed to be relict melt transport channels. Peridotites and pyroxenites found in these zones show evidence of interaction with a relatively depleted melt (high Cr, low Al and Ti in mineral phases), and textures that suggest the secondary precipitation of neoblastic pyroxenes along matrix olivine grain boundaries. Rare earth element concentrations of clinopyroxene from two peridotite groups suggest equilibration in the garnet stability field, and temperatures calculated from dysprosium concentrations are usually higher than those determined from two-pyroxene thermometry. Linear major element patterns versus MgO and whole rock REE compositions of Beni Bousera dunites suggest that they cannot have formed via partial melting alone. The data collected here also suggest that the massif has experienced several mantle P/T conditions, and continuously equilibrated during exhumation and emplacement into the crust. A comparison with the geometry of the melt transport domain at Ronda, another Mediterranean peridotite body, suggests that although Beni Bousera and Ronda may be related in age of exhumation, melt may have been transported via different pathways in the two massifs. by Christian D.
