40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a fabrication of hydrophilic Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) with periodic wrinkling surface. The proposed periodic wrinkling surface was fabricated using the sequential processes of typical curing process of PDMS, cutting process, <b>platinum</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>process,</b> and wrinkling transfer process. The surface morphology of the fabricated wrinkling surface was observed by using optical and dynamic {{atomic force microscopy}} and discussed. The measured period and amplitude of wrinkling was about 2. 2 μm and 0. 31 μm, respectively. And, the contact angles of water droplets on the wrinkled surface were measured {{in order to understand}} effect of the wrinkling surface on surface modification of hydrophobic PDMS. Our new finding was that the proposed wrinkling surface was hydrophilic and the measured contact angle was about 62 °. Moreover, it was found out from the simple cell culture test that the fabricate...|$|E
40|$|Small ribbon heaters (10 μm - 20 μm wide) {{have been}} used for many years to study the {{formation}} of microbubbles in liquids when short voltage pulses are applied. This thesis describes improvements in the device design with an emphasis on smaller and more sensitive heaters. I used a novel method of creating 250 nanometer wide heaters to keep both the fabrication time and costs as low as possible by using a focused ion beam to create the heaters from a set of larger devices. Ribbon heaters are usually fabricated on a thin SiO 2 layer on a silicon wafer which acts as a large heat sink whose effect becomes more pronounced the smaller the heater width. Suspending the heaters on a thin membrane dramatically increased their sensitivity in microboiling experiments. The suspended devices required the development of a very low stress <b>platinum</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>process...</b>|$|E

Supposing that <b>platinum</b> <b>deposition</b> occurs on the top surface, the reaction preferentially proceeds on the top, and platinum is not deposited inside the porous layer. In addition, it was reported that, when the nucleation of metal starts at the pore opening in the initial stage of the metal electrodeposition, the metal is preferentially deposited there, and the pore opening is plugged soon [1, 2]. This type of growth is observed in porous silicon with the hydrophilic surface.|$|R

Different substrata have been used in order to test the possibility and the extent of these reactions depending on the nature of material.

To avoid additional ionic current contributions the measurements were performed at dry membranes in argon atmosphere with a noncatalytic gold coated AFM tip.

30|$|Platinum is {{deposited}} {{within the}} hydrophobic microporous silicon in Figure 2. However, when the pore wall is hydrophilic, <b>platinum</b> <b>deposition</b> occurs {{only on the}} top of the porous layer. These results can be explained by the affinity of the pore wall to water molecules. Platinum complex ion ([PtCl 42 −) behaves like a molecule with lower polarity due to its large size. Therefore, platinum ions have high affinity to the hydrophobic pore wall compared with water molecules to the pore wall, and hence, platinum ions are excluded from bulk to the pore wall [6]. In case of platinum, platinum ions pass through a bare silicon surface because deposition proceeds toward the pore opening from the pore bottom. Therefore, <b>platinum</b> <b>deposition</b> behavior is affected by the hydration property of pore wall. In hydrophilic microporous silicon, once deposition occurs at the pore opening, platinum is not deposited into pores but on the top surface due to the need of high overpotential on the bare silicon.|$|R

Here, a simulation of the <b>platinum</b> <b>deposition</b> by radio frequency plasma sputtering has been developed and compared with experimental results to allow optimization of the <b>deposition</b> <b>process.</b> In the simulation, the transport of sputtered atoms through the argon plasma is obtained using a 3 D Monte Carlo model called SPaTinG (Sputtered Particles Transport in Gas). The Yamamura formula provides the Pt sputtering yield on the target, and the initial energy distribution of sputtered atoms is given by the Thompson distribution. A 1 D hybrid model is used to estimate the mean energy of argon ions impinging onto the platinum target. Experimentally, platinum is deposited on silicon in two plasma sputtering chambers with different geometries. The deposition rate is measured by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. The angular distribution of the Pt atoms ejected from the target surface and the condensation coefficient of the Pt atoms on silicon are calculated by adjusting the simulated and experimental deposition rates at 0. 5 Pa. A good agreement between the simulation and the experiment is observed as a function of the target–substrate distance for the two system geometries at low pressure (0. 5 Pa) ...|$|R

Fluorine has been introduced before or after <b>platinum</b> <b>deposition.</b> The different electrocatalysts are physico-chemically and electrochemically characterized, and the results discussed by comparison with commercial Pt/XC 72 from E-Tek. The results demonstrate that the level of fluorination of the carbon aerogel can be controlled. The fluorination modifies the texture of the carbons by increasing the pore size and decreasing the specific surface area, but the textures remain appropriate for PEMFC applications. Two fluorination sites are observed, leading to both high covalent C-F bond and weakened ones, the quantity of which depends on whether the treatment is done before or after <b>platinum</b> <b>deposition.</b> The order of the different treatments is very important. The presence of platinum contributes to the fluorination mechanism, but leads to amorphous platinum rather inactive towards the Oxygen Reduction Reaction.

40|$|Electron Beam Chemical Vapor Deposition (EBCVD) is {{a process}} by which an {{electron}} beam is used to decompose adsorbed reagent molecules to produce a deposit.

Important factors for the <b>deposition</b> <b>process</b> include the beam parameters and reagent gas composition. Simple structures are fabricated through utilization of the various scanning modes of an SEM. Fibers (pillar-like structures) can be deposited, and lines (wall-like structures) can be deposited easily. This investigation focuses on the <b>process</b> parameters controlling <b>deposition</b> rate and geometry for platinum and carbon fibers and lines in a modified SEM. <b>Platinum</b> <b>deposition</b> was performed using a system with a small diameter needle that supplied a localized flow of gas from an organometallic <b>platinum</b> compound. Carbon <b>deposition</b> was performed in the Environmental mode, in which the microscope chamber is filled with a specified pressure of reagent gas. Statistically designed experiments were performed for platinum fiber and line deposition. Analysis indicated that the beam current and deposition time were dominant factors in determining the deposition rate.

The line time had a significant effect on line height deposited per scan. Optimization analysis was performed, and results indicated that high voltage and high beam current led to higher aspect ratios. Medium voltage and low beam current were preferable for depositing minimal width lines (less than 200 nm). Low voltage and high beam current were preferable for maximum deposition rates. EDS and EELS performed for platinum deposits in a TEM indicated amorphous structure with no carbon detected. This differs significantly from previously reported results. Statistically designed experiments were performed for carbon line deposition. The voltage, beam current, and dwell/line time were studied. Increasing line time led to a significant increase in line height/scan and appeared to be a dominant factor. Lower beam currents appeared to favor higher deposition rates. TEM analysis indicated that carbon deposits were mostly amorphous. M. S. Committee Chair: Lackey, Jack; Committee Member: Orlando, Thomas; Committee Member: Sitaraman, Sures...|$|R
