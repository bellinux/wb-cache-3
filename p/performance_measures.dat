40|$|Purpose] This study {{investigated}} whether the Canadian Occupational <b>Performance</b> <b>Measure</b> is a suitable outcome measure for assessing patients with stroke {{in research and}} clinical settings. [Subjects and Methods] The study included into two parts: (1) {{an investigation of the}} reliability and validity of the Canadian Occupational <b>Performance</b> <b>Measure</b> for patients with stroke and (2) an exploration of Canadian Occupational <b>Performance</b> <b>Measure</b> results in randomized controlled trials of patients with stroke. For this review, the study searched the MEDLINE, PubMed, and CINAHL Plus with Full Text databases for articles published before September 2015. [Results] Finally, three eligible articles were collected in part 1, and ten randomized controlled trials studies were collected in part 2. The findings of part 1 revealed that the Canadian Occupational <b>Performance</b> <b>Measure</b> had efficient test– retest reliability, however, the Canadian Occupational <b>Performance</b> <b>Measure</b> revealed weak associations with other assessment tools such as Barthel Index used for patients with stroke. Six of the randomized controlled trials studies used the Canadian Occupational <b>Performance</b> <b>Measure</b> as a primary outcome and two as a secondary outcome, while the other two as a goal-setting instrument. [Conclusion] This review indicates that the Canadian Occupational <b>Performance</b> <b>Measure</b> is appropriate for clinicians, including physiotherapists, in assessing outcome for patients with stroke. The Canadian Occupational <b>Performance</b> <b>Measure</b> can assist patients in identifying their outcome performance and provide therapists with directions on interventions.

25|$|Before {{considering}} {{the factors that}} motivate the performance paradox, {{it is important to}} point out that characteristics known as comparability and variability differentiate good <b>performance</b> <b>measures</b> from bad ones. Comparability is defined as the potential to utilize a performance measure across different settings to horizontally compare performance. Variability is essential because it ensures that evaluations can be recorded on an outcome scale that is extended enough to vertically compare different levels of performance. Within organizations, these two properties are impacted by the use of several weakly correlated <b>performance</b> <b>measures</b> through a mechanism termed the running down process.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} <b>performance</b> <b>measures</b> {{change over}} time. A compilation of surveys examining the stated financial goals of companies over the century found the following: companies strove to maximize {{market share in}} the late 1960s; earnings per share in the mid-1970s; return on equity in the early 1980s; and cash flow and share prices in present day. Other surveys found that organizations' preferences for evaluating performance related to capital expenditures have shifted dramatically over time. For instance, in 1959, 13% of firms focused on internal rates of return while 86% of firms did so in 1988. In addition, the percentage of firms utilizing accounting measures decreased from 50% in 1959 to 12% in 1988. One potential reason that dominating <b>performance</b> <b>measures</b> change over time is that as organizations replace old measures when they discover their limitations.|$|E
25|$|Selection {{explains}} that <b>performance</b> <b>measures</b> decrease in variability within organizations because individuals learn to select better individuals to evaluate. For example, {{as the major}} league farm system has developed, teams have learned to select better batters and pitchers, contributing to the decrease in the variability of batting averages.|$|E

Simulation runs can be carried out to estimate this measure for different alternatives, but there are too many for all to be examined because there is a strict limit to the time available for simulations. If the accuracy with which the <b>performance</b> <b>measure</b> can be estimated increases with run length, then a balance has to be made between making few runs where the <b>performance</b> <b>measure</b> is accurately estimated and making a large number of runs but with the <b>performance</b> <b>measure</b> poorly estimated.

30|$|Note {{the twist}} in the <b>performance</b> <b>measure.</b> It {{consists}} of the actual local profit and the reported profit from the other divisions.

25|$|The {{theory of}} {{performance}} paradox {{is grounded in}} three characteristics of performance measurement. Firstly, there are many performance metrics, and the number continues to grow. Secondly, most measures of performance, even those that are used most frequently, exhibit little to no correlation with one another. And thirdly, the dominant <b>performance</b> <b>measures</b> at any given point in time change continuously.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, perverse {{learning}} {{results in}} stagnating performance levels within an organization because it leads individuals {{to focus on}} improving their outcome in <b>performance</b> <b>measures,</b> rather than their actual performance. For example, teachers may often dedicate their efforts towards improving their students' test scores rather than their teaching style. Similar to positive learning, perverse learning leads to a decreased variability in measured performance levels, but this performance improvement is artificial.|$|E

25|$|Individuals and {{organizations}} have designed numerous ways to measure performance {{and continue to}} do so at an increasing rate. Evidence for this observation can be found by tracking changes in <b>performance</b> <b>measures</b> over time. In the 19th century, companies measured their performance via industry-specific output and cost measures, such as newspaper circulation. By the 1920s, companies also began utilizing accounting-based returns measures, such as return on investment. And the 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of purely financial measures of performance relating information on dividends and return on equity. This dependence on <b>performance</b> <b>measures</b> has not diminished in recent years – on the contrary, the number of metrics that exist is growing at an even more accelerated rate. Today, in addition to financial measures, organizations examine nonfinancial metrics regarding leadership, information, planning, human resource utilization, and customer satisfaction. This proliferation in performance measurements has led to corresponding growth in the performance measurement industry – there has been a notable {{increase in the number of}} personnel {{and organizations}} devoted to examining performance-related metrics, such as certified public accountants and financial analysts.|$|E

Finally, financial <b>performance</b> <b>measures</b> should be a focus to identify how employee achievements contribute to the business' profitability.|$|E
