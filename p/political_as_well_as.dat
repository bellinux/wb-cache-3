He rose at five every morning to practice the piano, which he studied twice a week until he was fifteen. Truman worked as a page at the 1900 Democratic National Convention at Convention Hall in Kansas City; his father had many friends who were active in the Democratic Party and helped young Harry to gain his first political position.|$|E

In terms of military strategy, the Belgians {{were unwilling to}} stake everything on a linear defence of the Belgian–German border, in {{an extension of the}} Maginot Line. Such a move would leave the Belgians vulnerable to a German assault in their rear, through an attack on the Netherlands. Such a strategy would also rely on the French to move quickly into Belgium and support the garrison there.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Eorpwald's life or of his short reign, as little {{documentary}} evidence about the East Anglian kingdom has survived. The primary source for Eorpwald is the Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written by Bede in the 8th century. Soon after becoming king, Eorpwald received Christian teaching and was baptised in 627 or 632. Soon after his conversion {{he was killed by}} Ricberht, a pagan noble, who may have succeeded him and ruled for three years. The motive for Eorpwald's assassination was probably <b>political</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> religious. He was the first early English king to suffer death as a consequence of his Christian faith and was subsequently venerated by the Church as a saint and martyr.|$|E
5|$|A keep (from the Middle English kype) {{is a type}} of {{fortified}} tower built within castles {{during the}} Middle Ages by European nobility. Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep, but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences, used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary. The first keeps were made of timber and formed {{a key part of the}} motte-and-bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century; the design spread to England as a result of the Norman invasion of 1066, and in turn spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s. The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone keeps during the 10th and 11th centuries; these included Norman keeps, with a square or rectangular design, and circular shell keeps. Stone keeps carried considerable <b>political</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> military importance and could take up to a decade to build.|$|E

25|$|Many Medinans {{converted}} {{to the faith}} of the Meccan immigrants, particularly pagan and polytheist tribes, but there were fewer Jewish converts. The Jews rejected Muhammad's claim to prophethood, and further argued that some passages in the Qur'an contradicted the Torah. Their opposition was due to <b>political</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> religious reasons, as many Jews in Medina had close links with Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy, who was partial to the Jews and would have been Medina's prince if not for Muhammad's arrival.|$|E

Shia, on the other hand, believe that Muhammad designated his son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib as his true <b>political</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> religious successor.|$|E
25|$|Rape is theorized to be a {{reproductive}} {{strategy that}} facilitates {{the propagation of}} the rapist's progency. Such a strategy may be adopted by men who otherwise {{are unlikely to be}} appealing to women and therefore cannot form legitimate relationships, or by high status men on socially vulnerable women who are unlikely to retaliate to increase their reproductive success even further. The sociobiological theories of rape are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation, and objections to this theory are made on ethical, religious, <b>political,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> scientific grounds.|$|E
25|$|Males who {{under some}} {{circumstances}} used force {{may have had}} greater reproductive success in the ancestral environment than males who did not employ force. Sociobiological theories of rape are theories that explore to what degree, if any, evolutionary adaptations influence the psychology of rapists. Such theories are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation. Some object to such theories on ethical, religious, <b>political</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> scientific grounds.

25|$|While he ceded {{much of the}} {{authority}} of the imperial government to the cities, Julian also took more direct control himself. For example, new taxes and corvées had to be approved by him directly rather than left to the judgement of the bureaucratic apparatus. Julian certainly had a clear idea of what he wanted Roman society to be, both in <b>political</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> religious terms. The terrible and violent dislocation of the 3rd century meant that the Eastern Mediterranean had become the economic locus of the Empire. If the cities were treated as relatively autonomous local administrative areas, it would simplify the problems of imperial administration, which as far as Julian was concerned, should be focused on the administration of the law and defense of the empire's vast frontiers.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} of his Hebrew works is Pachad Yitzchaq (The Fear of Isaac), {{a description of the}} attack on the ghetto at Padua by the Christian populace on August 20, 1684, published at Amsterdam in 1685. This work contains a detailed account of all the incidents, in most of which he had taken part (Otzar Nechmad, iii. 131); and many documents of the governments of Padua and Venice are therein translated and quoted in Hebrew. An account of the internal condition of the Jewish community, together with statistics, serves as an introduction (p.10). The author develops entirely modern theories on the causes of these occurrences in the <b>political</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> the physical world (5a et seq.). Noteworthy also is his decided tolerance toward Christians. (See, for instance, pp.9a, 23g).|$|E
25|$|By {{the start}} of the 1950s, British Railways were making a working profit, albeit a small one. However, Britain had fallen well behind the rest of Europe in terms of {{dieselisation}} and electrification of its railways. There were <b>political</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> practical reasons behind the resistance to dieselisation in particular: the Labour Government of Clement Attlee did not want to significantly reduce the demand for domestically-produced coal in favour of imported oil, thus both affecting the balance of payments and potentially causing unemployment. Robin Riddles, who was effectively the British Railways' Chief Mechanical Engineer, disagreed with the dieselisation programme, arguing that it would be too expensive to import oil given the large amounts of domestically available coal. He continued to order steam locomotives on a large scale and from 1948 to 1953, 1,487 steam locomotives were built.|$|E

25|$|Even {{before the}} 1995 human rights treaty, the Charter of the CIS that was adopted in 1991 created, in article 33, a Human Rights Commission sitting in Minsk, Belarus.

In 1995, the CIS adopted a human rights treaty that includes civil and <b>political</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> social and economic human rights. This treaty entered into force in 1998. The CIS treaty is modeled on the European Convention on Human Rights, but lacking the strong implementation mechanisms of the latter. In the CIS treaty, the Human Rights Commission has very vaguely defined authority. The Statute of the Human Rights Commission, however, also adopted by the CIS Member States as a decision, gives the Commission the right to receive inter-state {{as well as individual}} communications.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Horowitz {{announced}} that he would return to the Soviet Union {{for the first time since}} 1925 to give recitals in Moscow and Leningrad. In the new atmosphere of communication and understanding between the USSR and the USA, these concerts were seen as events of <b>political,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> musical, significance. Most of the tickets for the Moscow concert were reserved for the Soviet elite and few sold to the general public. This resulted in a number of Moscow Conservatory students crashing the concert, which was audible to viewers of the internationally televised recital. The Moscow concert was released on a compact disc entitled Horowitz in Moscow, which reigned at the top of Billboard's Classical music charts for over a year. It was also released on VHS and, eventually, DVD. The concert was also widely seen on a Special Edition of CBS News Sunday Morning with Charles Kuralt, reporting from Moscow.|$|E
25|$|The King's {{chances of}} {{escaping}} from Newark were becoming smaller day by day, {{and they were}} not improved by a violent dispute between him and Rupert, Maurice, Lord Gerard and Sir Richard Willis, {{at the end of which}} these officers and many others rode away to ask Parliament for leave to go over-seas. The pretext of the quarrel mattered little, the distinction between the views of Charles and Digby on the one hand and Rupert and his friends on the other was fundamental to the latter peace had become a <b>political</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> a military necessity. Meanwhile, south Wales, with the single exception of Raglan Castle, had been overrun by Parliamentarians. Everywhere the Royalist posts were falling. The New Model, no longer fearing Goring, had divided, Fairfax reducing the garrisons of Dorset and Devon, Cromwell those of Hampshire. Amongst the latter was the famous Basing House, which was stormed at dawn on 14 October and burnt to the ground. Cromwell, his work finished, returned to headquarters, and the army wintered in the neighbourhood of Crediton.|$|E
