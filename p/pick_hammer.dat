Others had been lowered by ropes down shafts so narrow that {{when they got to}} the bottom it was only with extreme difficulty that they were able to stoop to work at the rock beneath their feet. Many, indeed, of these old shafts have been found in the mines of Montepone, so extremely narrow that it is supposed that they must have been bored by slaves lowered by ropes, head foremost, it appearing absolutely impossible for a man to stoop to work if lowered in the ordinary way.|$|E
40|$|Vibration {{sources are}} {{described}} for pneumatic hammers {{used in the}} mining industry (<b>pick</b> <b>hammers),</b> in boiler shops (riveting hammers), etc., bringing to light {{the fact that the}} principal vibration source is the variation in air pressure inside the cylinder. The present state of the art of vibration control of pneumatic hammers as it is practiced abroad, and the solutions adopted for this purpose, are discussed. A new type of pneumatic hammer with a low noise and vibration level is presented...|$|R
5000|$|Miners’ Lung: A History of Dust Disease in British Coal Mining by Arthur McIvor and Ronald Johnston is a 2007 book (...) {{which is}} part of the Studies in Labour History series. The book argues that British coal mining is the [...] "classic {{dangerous}} trade", and even those that escape the immediate dangers of the pit (mine collapses, explosions, suffocation) may be subject to years of pain, laboured breathing and eventual death. McIvor and Johnston relate the story of how the dust created by the <b>picks,</b> <b>hammers,</b> and pneumatic tools [...] "crept deep into the lungs of the otherwise powerfully built, healthy workers, eventually incapacitating them, ruining their bodies and killing them".|$|R

5|$|The {{fresh water}} {{entering}} Florida Bay from the Everglades creates ideal conditions for vast beds of turtle grass and algae formations that foster animal {{life in the}} bay. Sea turtles and manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) eat the grass, while invertebrates such as worms, clams, and other mollusks consume algae formations and microscopic plankton. Female sea turtles return annually to nest on the shore, and manatees spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay. The Calusa Indians had various uses for shells of marine invertebrates, {{due to the lack}} of dense rock with which to make tools. They used the horse conch (Pleuroploca gigantea), left-handed whelk (Busycon contrarium), and the Florida crown conch (Melongena corona) as drinking vessels, <b>picks,</b> <b>hammers,</b> knives and awls.|$|R
50|$|A war hammer is a {{late medieval}} weapon (List of medieval weapons) of war {{intended}} for close combat action, whose design resembles the hammer. Its appearance {{is similar to}} that of an ice axe. In military history, there are several types of these weapons, such as Bec de corbin, horseman's <b>pick,</b> Lucerne <b>hammer,</b> Shepherd's axe.|$|R

50|$|This early vibrato was {{actuated}} after striking chords {{or individual}} notes; lowering or modulating the pitch as the notes decayed. Hendrix greatly extended {{the use of}} vibrato; using it while <b>picking,</b> <b>hammering</b> on, pulling off and with harmonics and feedback tones. His intense use led to problems staying in tune, which he compensated for (to some degree) by exerting tremendous right hand strength to bend individual strings within a chord back in tune and by frequently tuning, even within songs. To emphasize the tonal range of the guitar, Hendrix would push down on the Wah pedal (a customized VOX wah) and play stinging high notes and then pull back on the Wah pedal and depress the vibrato to create a freight train like rumble. When fully depressing the bar to create these low notes the slack strings would often fall off the nut {{and have to be}} quickly snapped back in position.|$|R
25|$|Ore {{was brought}} to the surface up a winding shaft outside the coe. The miners' {{equipment}} included <b>picks,</b> <b>hammers</b> and wedges to split the rock, wiskets or baskets to contain it, corves or sledges to drag it to the shaft bottom, and windlasses or stows, to lift it to the surface. In later years underground transport was improved by replacing corves by wagons, often running on wooden or metal rails. A good example of an 18th-century wooden railway {{can be found in the}} Merry Tom mine, near Via Gellia. The miners avoided the need to excavate hard rock whenever they could and where it was unavoidable sometimes resorted to fire-setting. A fire was built against the rock face after mining had finished for the day and allowed to burn through the night. Fragmentation of the heated rock was increased by throwing water on to it. The rule about fire-setting only after the end of the day's work was important because in the confined mines the smoke was deadly. Fire-setting was a skilled technique and was used sparingly for that reason as well as because of the disruption caused by the smoke and the danger from splintering rock.|$|R

50|$|It is {{situated}} in {{the valley of the}} Upper Hasbani (Wadi el-Fatir) on the right bank, north-east of the village of Dnaibe, east of the road. It was first recorded by A. Kuschke in 1954 followed by Lorraine Copeland and J. King in 1966 and lastly by Jacques Besançon and Francis Hours in 1968. Besançon recovered a fragment from an arrowhead a <b>pick</b> or <b>hammer</b> and a serrated sickle blade. These gave a very slight dating suggesting Ubaid occupation equivalent to early neolithic Byblos.|$|R
50|$|Up to 1,300 {{men were}} {{employed}} during the project, of whom {{more than forty}} lost their lives. Shaped 10-tonne blocks of limestone were used to create an outer facing wall, thereby encasing a rubble mound raised from the sea both by dumping from ships and tipping from the shore. Divers in submarine bells created the level foundations on which the tiers of facing stones were placed. These men worked underwater using <b>picks</b> and <b>hammers,</b> and carried out blasting using gunpowder sealed in watertight tin pipes.|$|R

When the series got <b>picked</b> up, <b>Hammer</b> created the 60 second version of the theme. The synth-guitar lead was missing in the aired version of the pilot and the first batch of episodes, and this unfinished version of the theme has remained attached to those episodes, even on the DVD video box set released in 2005.|$|R
50|$|Helen Margaret Duncan (May 3, 1910 - August 14, 1971) was a {{geologist}} and paleontologist with the United States Geological Survey from 1945 to 1971, {{where she worked}} in the Paleontology and Stratigraphy Branch. Duncan {{was considered one of}} the strongest women in the Cincinnati geology department; her contributions to the Lipalian Research Foundation and the <b>Pick</b> and <b>Hammer</b> shows were additional work of her time. Duncan paved the path for many geology scholars to follow with her discoveries on fossil records and her studies in paleontology and stratigraphy.|$|R
50|$|The RAINPEC Project {{spent much}} of its energy {{excavating}} and studying the tools {{that were used in}} limestone excavation and preparation. They had unearthed 23 tools including bifacial axes, <b>picks,</b> and <b>hammer</b> stones, all of which were made of chert. The researches then replicated these tools to see what the methods of mining and shaping the limestone were. Not only did they come to realize that chert was an excellent tool for precision cutting of limestone, but these experiments shed light on how the Maya not only harvested the limestone, but how they shaped it to use for their elaborate complex architectural building.|$|R
60|$|As day dawned the {{destruction}} {{which had been}} wrought was clearly visible. The doors were in splinters, the lower window frames were all smashed in, scarce a pane of glass remained in its place throughout the whole building, the stonework was dotted and splashed with bullet marks, the angles of the windows were chipped and broken, there were dark patches of blood in many places in the courtyard, and the yard itself and the roads leading from the mill were strewn with guns, <b>picks,</b> levers, <b>hammers,</b> and pikes, which had been thrown away by the discomfited rioters in their retreat.|$|R
50|$|Dominican amber {{especially}} Dominican blue amber - is mined through bell pitting, {{which is}} extremely dangerous. The bell pit {{is basically a}} foxhole dug with whatever tools are available. Machetes do the start, some shovels, <b>picks</b> and <b>hammers</b> may participate eventually. The pit itself goes as deep as possible or safe, sometimes vertical, sometimes horizontal, but never level. It snakes into hill sides, drops away, joins up with others, goes straight up and pops out elsewhere. 'Foxhole' applies indeed: rarely are the pits large enough to stand in, and then only at the entrance. Miners crawl around on their knees using short-handled picks, shovels and machetes.|$|R
5000|$|The 1120 yd long tunnel, up to {{six feet}} wide and four feet high, had ten {{ventilation}} shafts each up to 3 yd wide and up to 49 yd deep. Driven from Bottling Wood to Park Pit, work started in 1653 and finished in 1670. The miners used <b>picks,</b> <b>hammers,</b> wedges and spades and would have encountered blackdamp which would have extinguished their candles warning them of its presence. The sough was completed without using explosives {{but it is possible}} that fires were lit against the rock {{at the end of a}} shift to help break it. The shafts were used to remove rock as the miners cut the tunnel. Progress averaged 66 yd per year or about 4 ft a week. Between its outlet and Park Pit the sough passed through several layers of hard sandstones, mudstones and the Cannel and King Coal seams. Seven ventilation shafts, roughly aligned with the main drive to Haigh Hall, were worked as small collieries and the rest filled in. The first shaft from the outfall, Cannel Hollows Pit, was 23 ft deep. The fifth shaft, Sandy Beds Pit, was sunk 30 yd to the sough and met the coal seam at 14 yd. Its shaft was rectangular in section but the others were round. The last shaft before Park Pit was 48 yd deep to the sough and met the Cannel seam at 32 yd. The shaft at Park Pit was 46 yd to the sough and met the King Coal seam at 41 yd.|$|R

60|$|After a time, {{they came}} in sight of a gang of elk. Wyeth was {{immediately}} for pursuing them, rifle in hand, but saw evident signs of dissatisfaction in his half-breed hunters; who considered him as trenching upon their province, and meddling with things quite above his capacity; for these veterans of the wilderness are exceedingly pragmatical, on points of venery and woodcraft, and tenacious of their superiority; looking down with infinite contempt upon all raw beginners. The two worthies, therefore, sallied forth themselves, but after a time returned empty-handed. They laid the blame, however, entirely on their guns; two miserable old pieces with flint locks, which, with all their <b>picking</b> and <b>hammering,</b> were continually apt to miss fire. These great boasters of the wilderness, however, are very often exceeding bad shots, and fortunate it is for them when they have old flint guns to bear the blame.|$|R
50|$|Pecora also {{addressed}} {{the discovery of}} large oil reserves {{of oil and gas}} on the north coast of Alaska in 1968. Under his Direction, the U.S. Geological Survey made a careful study of the geologic aspects of the proposed pipeline route. From 1947 to 1967 {{he was a member of}} the United States Civil Service Commission's Board of Examiners for Geology, concerned with the development and maintenance of standards in the selection of geologists for federal employment. He was an active member of the Survey's <b>Pick</b> and <b>Hammer</b> shows, which were presented annually to make fun of top Survey managers. In 1970, Pecora expressed his opposition to burying the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, as it would be unsafe to place an underground pipeline in Arctic land He was appointed to serve as Undersecretary of the United States Department of Interior by President Richard Nixon on April 1, 1971.|$|R
50|$|For {{short-range}} weapons, the war hammer {{was compared}} to the Zulu axe. The war hammer smashed one skull and impaled another in under two seconds. The <b>hammer's</b> <b>pick</b> penetrated four inches into the gel skull, generating enough blunt force to drive through the upper palate of the mouth and split the skull in half. The Zulu axe was used to chop up a leg of beef, being measured at a velocity of 23 mph. The Zulu axe was given the edge because of its longer reach and higher speed.|$|R
50|$|The {{rules of}} the game are the same as those in the {{original}} Adventure Island, with the main new feature being the addition of an inventory system. Before the player begins a stage, he can choose which of Higgins' animal friends to bring (if he has rescued any), as well as whether or not he should bring one of the stone hammers he has accumulated. Because of this, the player can no longer upgrade to shooting fireballs when he <b>picks</b> a second <b>hammer.</b> Instead, it gets added as a reserved hammer to the player's inventory.|$|R

60|$|Nasmyth {{had been}} in the saddle since sunrise, in bitter frost and {{whirling}} snow, but he <b>picked</b> up a <b>hammer,</b> and Mattawa seized a drill. There was no room to swing the hammer, and Nasmyth struck half crouching, while, chilly as the heading was, the perspiration dripped from him, and the veins rose swollen on his forehead. He was up against it, and a man strikes hardest when he is pressed back to the wall.

50|$|Begazy-Dandybai villages {{were located}} {{at the feet of}} rocky hills, close to {{plentiful}} sources of water and fuel. In the Tokraun, Nura, Sary Su, Atasu, Ishim, Selety, and other valleys were densely located villages of ancient miners and metallurgists. Begazy-Dandybai people produced pots, pitchers, bowls, cups, vessels with spouts, etc. Ceramic pots were fired globular jugs with high neck and collar rim. Ceramic was made of clay mixed with granitic sand. Grave inventory and dwellings contain many metal and bone tools: bronze pins, needles, buttons, linings, bone needle boxes, and buttons. Large number of tools was used in mining: <b>hammers,</b> <b>picks,</b> hoes, graters, mortars, pestles, and stone molds.|$|R
50|$|Hammerers are a Dwarf king's {{personal}} body-guard, {{chosen by}} the king himself. The history of the Hammerers goes back to when the High King was visiting the mines of Ekrund when a large cave in occurred.

5000|$|A geologist's hammer, rock <b>hammer,</b> rock <b>pick,</b> or {{geological}} <b>pick</b> is a <b>hammer</b> {{used for}} splitting and breaking rocks. In field geology, {{they are used}} to obtain a fresh surface of a rock to determine its composition, bedding orientation, nature, mineralogy, history, and field estimate of rock strength. In fossil and mineral collecting, they are employed to break rocks with the aim of revealing fossils inside. Geologist's hammers are also sometimes used for scale in a photograph. The hammer also serves {{as an extension of the}} senses, permitting the geologist to perceive the rock's granularity, soundness, and resistance to fracturing that may be relevant to its use or identification.|$|R
