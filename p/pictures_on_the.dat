5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle the <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{script was}} laid out similar to a comic book, with <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left and dialog and {{descriptions}} on the right. Jeunet planned every shot, which {{made it easier for}} visual effects artists to do their work. Blue Sky Studios was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the company's work on Joe's Apartment creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted to hire the company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures' legs were in frame, as Jeunet felt that a man in a suit is easy to distinguish when the full body is seen.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1980s, {{the most}} {{reproduced}} and publicized of Bauer's works were two paintings depicting the princess and the moose from Sagan om älgtjuren Skutt och lilla prinsessan Tuvstarr (The Tale of the Moose Hop and the Little Princess Cotton Grass), published in 1913. The first picture {{is of the}} princess riding on the moose {{and the second is}} of the moose standing guard over the sleeping princess. They were mainly used as <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall in nurseries. The same tale also contains the picture of Tuvstarr gazing down into the tarn looking for her lost heart, an allegory of innocence lost. Bauer made several studies of this motif. During the 1980s the painting of Tuvstarr and the tarn was used in advertising for a shampoo. This started a debate in Sweden about how works of art, considered part of the national heritage, should be used. In 1999, the picture again appeared in advertising, this time in a manipulated version in which all the trees had been cut down and Tuvstarr seemed to be lamenting them. The award-winning advertising campaign was made by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and helped further the newly awakened environmental movement in Sweden. In his biography on Bauer, Gunnar Lindqvist argues that the picture has become too commercialized.|$|E

The use of petroforms, petroglyphs, and pictographs was common throughout the Ojibwe traditional territories.

25|$|The {{well-known}} Baroque painter Martino Altomonte, who {{was over}} eighty during this commission, created the altar-pieces within six years. According to a Cistercian custom, the high altar-piece {{is dedicated to}} the Assumption of Mary. The two anterior altar-pieces, placed nearest to the high altar, refer to Mary’s work in the Benedictine (left) and Cistercian (right) Orders. The <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two middle altars show the death of Saint Joseph (left) and the guardian angel (right). Both altar-pieces at the back are dedicated to the Fourteen Holy Helpers (die Vierzehn Nothelfer): the holy virgins to the left and the intercessors for agriculture to the right. The paintings represent Late Baroque Italian Classicism.|$|E
25|$|Papak's {{picture has}} been drawn on both Shapur's coins and later Ardashir's; {{in the picture}} of the Papak drawn on Shapur's coins, he wears a wig {{dissimilar}} to normal Parthian and local Persian shahs and only Shapur has worn a royal wig. According to royal reports, it was Papak who overthrew Gochihr and appointed Shapur instead of him. Ardashir refused to accept Shapur's appointment and removed his brother and whoever stood against him and then minted coins with his face drawn on them and Papak's behind them. Papak's picture on Ardashir-Papak coins, wears a wig similar to those of local Persian shahs in contrast to his picture in Shapur-Papak coins. According to the descriptions given on Papak's <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coins, it is probable that the determining role of Ardashir depicted in leading the rebellion against the central government is the product of later historical studies. It is probable that Papak had united most of Pars under his rule by the time; since his picture exists on Ardashir's coins too.|$|E

25|$|Howes {{moved to}} the family's country house in Essendon, Hertfordshire for the {{duration}} of World War II. She was a show-business baby who lived a quiet, orderly childhood where she grew up with a nanny and was surrounded by a variety of pets and her parents' theatrical peers, including actor/writer Jack Hulbert and his wife, actress Cicely Courtneidge, who had an adjoining house. Her first taste of the stage was school productions, but as she came from a theatrical family, it was inevitable that another family friend, an agent who was visiting the Howes family for dinner, became impressed with her and not long after suggested the young Sally Ann for a role in a movie. Two hundred young girls had already been screen tested without success, and the producers were desperate to find a talented little girl to play the lead, and they asked her father to please rush in some <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> recommendation of the agent. The movie, Thursday's Child, was written by playwright and screenwriter Rodney Ackland, also a close neighbour to the Howes family, and it would become Ackland's directorial debut. Thursday's Child (1943) launched her career. A second film, The Halfway House (1944), led to her being put under contract by Michael Balcon of Ealing Studios, and this was followed by many other film roles as a child actress, including Dead of Night (1945) with Sir Michael Redgrave, Pink String and Sealing Wax (1946), Nicholas Nickleby (1947), My Sister and I (1948) and Anna Karenina (1948), with Vivien Leigh.|$|E
25|$|Its air echelon {{was moved}} up to Wakde on 25 May to provide air cover for the {{invasion}} of Biak, leaving the ground crews behind at Finschhafen. On 27 May, when the invasion of Biak began, four B-25s from the squadron provided the first air cover for the invasion troops shortly after first light. The 17th's aircraft provided direct air support to the troops on Biak when called upon, but were endangered by trigger-happy friendly anti-aircraft gunners. On 28 May, a B-25 from the squadron that was cleared to drop <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beachhead was shot down by friendly fire. The Japanese began attempted to send a reinforcement convoy of troop-laden destroyers to Biak on 8 June after an air raid on Wakde {{on the night of}} 5–6 June damaged many Allied aircraft, leaving the 17th Squadron the only aviation unit available to intercept the first convoy. Ten B-25s from the squadron led by squadron commander Major William G. Tennille, Jr. spotted the convoy, which they reported to consist of two cruisers and four destroyers, at 1250 hours near Amsterdam Island. Two larger destroyers were misidentified as cruisers. The squadron made a low-level attack, sinking the destroyer Harusame and damaging three other ships. Three aircraft, including Tennille's plane, were shot down, and the remainder were so badly damaged by anti-aircraft fire that the entire 17th Reconnaisssance air echelon was sent back to Finschhafen two days later to reform. Tennille and Lieutenant Howard Wood posthumously received the Distinguished Service Cross for their actions.|$|E
