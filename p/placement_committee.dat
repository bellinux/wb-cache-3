40|$|PURPOSE : To {{determine}} {{the position and}} occurrence of the midline mandibular canal (MLC) in the various age, sex, population and dentition groups. The average distances from the MLC to a planned mandibular midline implant and the inferior mandibular border were measured. MATERIALS AND METHODS : Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was used to scan 122 mandibles (31 black males; 28 black females; 32 white males and 31 white females). Midsagittal sections in the reconstructed images of edentulous mandibles or sagittal sections through the socket of the 41 tooth (FDI nomenclature) in dentate mandibles were made. A measurement of 6 mm across buccolingually (BL) was delineated with the caliper tool indicating the minimum dimensions for placement of an implant. In dentate cases where the BL distance was in excess of 6 mm, the caliper was placed across the deepest part of the socket as a marker to {{determine the}} bone dimension available below the socket for implant placement. From these markers a vertical line was dropped to the MLC to measure the available bone. RESULTS : The MLC was a consistent finding within the anterior mandible. A statistical significant difference in bone availability amongst the sexes and with dentition pattern was found indicating that edentulous female patients were particularly at risk of injury to the vessels of the midline lingual canal during implants in that area. CONCLUSION : Immediate implants {{in the position of}} lower central incisors are regarded as a safe procedure as is the placement of interforaminal implants in the anterior mandible. Clinicians should however take note of the position of the midline mandibular lingual canal and approach this area with caution, especially if the alveolar ridge is to be reduced before implant <b>placement.</b> Research <b>committee</b> of the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pretoria.

40|$|The most {{prevalent}} method {{for the prevention}} of freeze-thaw and salt scaling damage in cement based materials is through the entrainment of air voids using air entraining chemical admixtures (AEA's). However, the common field methods for measuring air content in fresh concrete cannot distinguish between entrained and entrapped air voids, and the actual air content in the hardened concrete can vary from that determined by these tests due to a variety of factors such as workability, placing operations, consolidation efforts, and environmental conditions. Previous research has shown the ability of ultrasonic attenuation to distinguish between entrained and entrapped air voids in hardened cement paste, providing a foundation for an inversion procedure to calculate the size and volume content of the two scatterer sizes. While additional challenges are present with measurements in fresh paste, the use of an immersion setup can overcome the limitations of cement paste containment vessels and provide a means to measure air content from batching to placement. An immersion apparatus to monitor ultrasonic wave attributes including attenuation in fresh cement paste is designed and built. Results comparing air entrained and non-air entrained cement pastes are presented. Ultrasonic wave attributes are studied as a function of time and level of chemical air entrainer. Finally, recommendations are made to improve the accuracy of the immersion apparatus in order to develop an in situ, quality control procedure to quantify the air content of fresh cement paste from batching to <b>placement.</b> M.

40|$|Federal lawmakers often {{praise the}} American state governments as "laboratories of democracy" {{conducting}} policy experiments from which other governments can learn. However, federalism scholarship {{recognizes that the}} federal government has strong incentives to preempt state policy and impose federal mandates in trying to achieve national policy goals. The safeguards of state power in the federal system - political, institutional, and democratic constraints - have changed and weakened over time, leaving the state governments vulnerable to the political interests of the national government. Like other interest groups, the states have developed techniques to safeguard the balance of power in the federal system as well as communicate their policy interests to national lawmakers and educate others about their unique policy developments. Prior studies of American federalism have relied on the behavior of public official associations representing multiple state governments as the source of information about intergovernmental advocacy and state policy goals. This dissertation argues that the study of aggregate intergovernmental interests through the positions of the associations conceals variation in the advocacy activity and goals of the individual state governments. Quantitative analysis of patterns in state lobbying behavior as well as qualitative analysis of congressional hearings is conducted using a unique database of the hearing testimony by state government officials and public official associations from the 103 rd- 108 th Congress (1993 - 2004). This demonstrates that the state governments are dynamic participants in federal policymaking but their influence is not constant across all policy areas. Individual states are found to have varying levels of activity in federal policymaking which are dependent on the <b>committee</b> <b>placement</b> of members from the state's congressional delegation. In some cases the states' capacity to develop policy expertise and craft innovative policy is predictive of its participation in congressional hearings but this is not as important a factor as expected. Members of Congress are most likely to invite intergovernmental witnesses based on their relationship to the state government and, less frequently, based on the state's record of distinction in policy innovation...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} three {{emerging}} applications of OR/MS, namely, (i) disease spread modeling, intervention strategies, and {{food supply chain}} management during an influenza pandemic, (ii) the practical applications of production planning and scheduling in the commercial lithographic printing industry, and (iii) packing/placement problems in chip design in the semiconductor industry. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we study an emergency response planning problem motivated by discussions with the American Red Cross, which has taken on a responsibility to feed people in case of an influenza pandemic. During an emergency such as an influenza pandemic or a bioterror attack, regular distribution channels of critical products and services including food and water may be disrupted, or some of the infected individuals may not be able to go to grocery stores. We analyze the geographical spread of the disease and develop solution approaches for designing the food distribution supply chain network in case of an influenza pandemic. In addition, we investigate the effect of voluntary quarantine on the disease spread and food distribution supply chain network. Finally, we analyze the effect of influenza pandemic on the workforce level. In the second part, we study a real life scheduling/packing problem motivated by the practices in the commercial lithographic printing industry which make up the largest segment of the printing industry. We analyze the problem structure and develop efficient algorithms to form cost effective production schedules. In addition, we propose a new integer programming formulation, strengthen it by adding cuts and propose several preprocessing steps to solve the problem optimally. In the last part of the thesis, motivated by the chip design problem in the semiconductor industry, we study a rectangle packing/placement problem. We discuss the hardness of the problem, explore the structural properties, and discuss a special case which is polynomially solvable. Then, we develop an integer programming formulation and propose efficient algorithms to find a ``good' <b>placement.</b> Ph.
