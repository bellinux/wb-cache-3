40|$|The use {{of natural}} {{colorants}} is highly increasing in the food industry due to strong consumer demand for more natural products. On the other hand, synthetic colorant give harms to consumers that may affect health because of the unsuitable chemicals contained. Color stability of certain product is important to maintain its appearance that differs in many aspects. This study aimed at determining the color stability of <b>blue</b> <b>pea</b> flower based on the storage days, the use of different solvents and its concentrations. The <b>blue</b> <b>pea</b> flower was kept soaked at room temperature with each methanol and ethanol as solvents and an addition of maltodextrin as stabilizer every day for 7 days. Solutions of colors and solvents, methanol and ethanol were then heated at boiling point of each solvent, 64. 7 °C and 78. 4 °C, respectively. The samples obtained was analyzed and tested by using a programmed spectrophotometer, giving results of its qualities and changes of the color. Based on the results, methanol with concentration of 20 percent and storage days at the 7 th day is at its best in maintaining the color stability. The value of L and a* are quite consistent through the days while b* value undergo little changes that shows its stability compared to other parameters. Thus, the color stability of the <b>blue</b> <b>pea</b> flower based on data collected is suitable to be a natural colorant with a high stability to replace synthetic colorant...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{chromosome}} translocation involving the Z chromosome and Chromosome 1, the NM 7659 t(Z+;lq—), (T) {{was used in}} a genetic linkage test with pea comb (P) and blue egg (O). The translocation break point on Chromosome 1 is on the long arm, close to the centromere. It had been previously suggested that the loci for P and O are located on the short arm. Significant linkages of 10. 4 ± 1. 5 map units between P and T, 13. 5 ± 2. 4 map units between O and T, and 3. 1 ± 1. 1 map units between O and P-were found. The linear order is T-P-O.

5|$|Changes {{were made}} in 1876, {{introducing}} more elaborate uniforms for commissioned officers based on those worn by the 13th Hussars, with similarly militaristic uniforms for the other ranks, using gold braid to distinguish the non-commissioned officers. These uniforms were initially of rather low quality, as the government had contracted out the work to prison convicts. The winter uniforms comprised grey overcoats with fur caps and moccasins, although the police preferred wearing warmer buffalo coats, which were available until the herds died out. In 1886, the hussar-style uniforms were replaced by a simpler dragoon version, and dark-blue undress uniforms introduced. In the 1880s, <b>blue</b> <b>pea</b> jackets made from pilot cloth became popular among the police {{as part of their}} winter outfit, and were officially issued from 1893 onwards.

The heat and colour stability tests are done at temperature 30, 37, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 ˚C with light and dark conditions. It was found that the heat stability test showed temperature did have effect on colour intensity of the plants in which the colours faded while the colour stability test indicated colour degradation as approaching day 14. Formulated lipsticks (natural and synthetic) have different solubility in the organic solvents tested. Thus, research suggests that formulated lipsticks (natural) were more soluble in all type of organic solvents...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{interest}} in anthocyanin pigments shows an increasing tendency {{due to their}} possible health benefits as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, protection from cardiovascular damage, diabetes preventation and vision improvement. Clitoria ternatea, a local flower which also an indigenous climber herbs, {{has been found to}} produce pigments mostly anthocyanin. In this research, anthocyanin from Clitoria ternatea, also known as <b>blue</b> <b>pea</b> flower was extracted by using water. The anthocyanin extract were encapsulated by using spray dry method, which three parameters are being studied, that are inlet air temperature, maltodextrin addition, and also feed flow rate. The technique of using spray dryer is preferable as transformation of juices into dry powders is quite hard due to the high sugar and acid contents. The experimental research was done by using Laboratory Scale Spray Dryer SD 06 AG, with the range of 160 °C to 190 °C of temperature, maltodextrin addition of 0 % to 40 % and feed flow rate of 5 ml/min to 20 ml/min. Further analysis {{on the quality of the}} powder obtained from spray drying process were verified by measuring total phenol content, anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity by using UV-Vis U 1800 Spectrophotometer at certain wavelengths. Maltodextrin DE 10 had been used as carrier in the spray dryer to prevent wall-deposition formation during the process. As result indicates that at 170 °C of inlet temperature, with 30 % maltodextrin addition and 10 ml/min of feed flow rate is the best condition to encapsulate CTAE by using spray dry...|$|R
