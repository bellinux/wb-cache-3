40|$|<b>Parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> maps allow {{a better}} {{understanding}} of various geoelectric responses, and they are also helpful in designing optimal new arrays for specific problems. We constructed systematic <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> maps for various geoelectric arrays, and in this paper several examples are presented, among others for non-linear and focussed arrays. Our <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> values are computed from the response of a small-size cube in a homogeneous subsurface at three different depths. Instead of 3 D numerical modelling results we consider the small cube as a superposition of three electric dipoles, corresponding to the electric charge accumulation at the opposite cube faces. We apply simple analytical formulas and we present the <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> values separately for the individual dipoles. Several theoretical and practical aspects are discussed. We recommend a methodical use of <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> maps in geoelectric prospecting...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{generalized}} limit for <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in quantum estimation theory considering {{the effects of}} repeated and adaptive measurements. Based on the quantum Ziv-Zakai bound, we derive some lower bounds for <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> when the Hamiltonian of system is unbounded and when the adaptive measurements are implemented on the system. We also prove that the <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is bounded by the limit of the minimum detectable parameter. In particular, we examine several known states in quantum phase estimation with non-interacting photons, and show {{that they can not}} perform better than Heisenberg limit in a much simpler way with our result.

Such sensitivity derivatives are elusive at best when working with geometry defined within the solid modeling context of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems. Solid modeling CAD systems are often proprietary and always complex, thereby necessitating ad hoc procedures to infer <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> A new perspective is presented that makes direct use of the hierarchical associativity of CAD features to trace their evolution and thereby track design <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> In contrast to ad hoc methods, this method provides a more concise procedure following the model design intent and determining the sensitivity of CAD geometry directly to its respective defining parameters...|$|E

We present them as anomalies due to electric dipoles forming on opposing surfaces of an elementary cube within the subsurface at three different depths, and not only the total effect of the dipole, but also of its components are shown. <b>Parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> maps of non-linear arrays, compared to those of linear arrays, have in general 1. more equal sensitivity values in x and y directions, 2. more chances for antisymmetry axes, 3. smoother lateral distribution of sensitivity values.

40|$|Background: Dynamic {{mathematical}} {{models in}} the form of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) {{play an important role in}} systems biology. For any sufficiently complex model, the speed and accuracy of solving the ODEs by numerical integration is critical. This applies especially to systems identification problems where the <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivities</b> must be integrated alongside the system variables. Although several very good general purpose ODE solvers exist, few of them compute the <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivities</b> automatically. Results: We present a novel integration algorithm that is based on second derivatives and contains other unique features such as improved error estimates. These features allow the integrator to take larger time steps than other methods. In practical applications, i. e. systems biology models of different sizes and behaviors, the method competes well with established integrators in solving the system equations, and it outperforms them significantly when local <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivities</b> are evaluated. For ease-of-use, the solver is embedded in a framework that automatically generates the integrator input from an SBML description of the system of interest. Conclusions: For future applications, comparatively ‘cheap’ <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivities</b> will enable advances in solving large, otherwise computationally expensive parameter estimation and optimization problems. More generally, we argue that substantially better computational performance can be achieved by exploiting characteristics specific to the problem domain; elements of our methods such as the error estimation could find broader use in other, more general numerical algorithms...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the general features of <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> maps and illustrates their practical use. We deﬁne <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> maps as geoelectric {{responses in the}} measuring plane (at the surface) due to an elementary cube within the subsurface at three diﬀerent depths. Responses of the three component {{as well as the}} total response of electrical dipoles formed on opposite cube surfaces are shown. In this paper we present such maps for 14 various linear electrode arrays. This paper is followed by an accompanying one about nonlinear and focusse d arrays. <b>Parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> maps in these two papers provide a compact characterization of all known geoelectric arrays. We give several examples how to use them in planning and interpretation of ﬁeld measurements...|$|E

Then the <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is approximatively calculated by (3). Note that the variable y is a function of time, and the parameter sensitivities from different instances form a trajectory sensitivity curve.|$|E

40|$|A multi-physics {{model for}} a {{cylindrical}} Li-ion battery has been developed by coupling the thermal distribution in the radial direction to an electrochemical P 2 D model. The model can predict both terminal voltage and surface temperature, which has the advantage {{that it can be}} readily validated by measurement. A sensitivity analysis of up to 30 parameters was carried out using model simulation. A <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> matrix was established to describe the <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> under different operating conditions and the parameters were grouped according to their average sensitivity. The parameters were clustered based on their sensitivity matrix with Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) method. The cluster centers are special operating conditions on which the parameters in the same cluster have high identifiability. Finally, a stepwise experiment is designed based on the analysis results of <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> and the rationality and effectiveness are also validated. It was shown that the stepwise approach to parameter identification results in significantly higher accuracy...|$|E
40|$|To ensure {{reliable}} {{results of}} hydrological models, {{it is essential}} that the models reproduce the hydrological process dynamics adequately. Information about simulated process dynamics is provided by looking at the temporal sensitivities of the corresponding model parameters. For this, the temporal dynamics of <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> are analysed to identify the simulated hydrological processes. Based on these analyses it can be verified if the simulated hydrological processes match the observed processes of the real world. We present a framework that makes use of processes observed in a study catchment to verify simulated hydrological processes. Temporal dynamics of <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of a hydrological model are interpreted to simulated hydrological processes and compared with observed hydrological processes of the study catchment. The results of the analysis show the appropriate simulation of all relevant hydrological processes in relation to processes observed in the catchment. Thus, we conclude that temporal dynamics of <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> are helpful for verifying simulated processes of hydrological models...|$|E
40|$|Diagnostics of {{hydrological}} {{models are}} pivotal {{for a better}} understanding of catchment functioning, and the analysis of dominating model parameters plays a key role for region-specific calibration or parameter transfer. A major challenge in the analysis of <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is the assessment of both temporal and spatial differences of parameter influences on simulated streamflow response. We present a methodological approach for global sensitivity analysis of hydrological models. The multilevel approach is geared towards complementary forms of streamflow response targets, and combines sensitivity analysis directed to hydrological fingerprints, i. e. temporally independent and temporally aggregated characteristics of streamflow (INDPAS), with the conventional analysis of the temporal dynamics of <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (TEDPAS). The approach was tested in 14 mesoscale headwater catchments of the Ruhr River in western Germany using simulations with the spatially distributed hydrological model mHM. The multilevel analysis with diverse response characteristics allowed us to pinpoint <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> patterns much more clearly as compared to using TEDPAS alone. It was not only possible to identify two dominating parameters, for soil moisture dynamics and evapotranspiration, but we could also disentangle the role of these and other parameters with reference to different streamflow characteristics. The combination of TEDPAS and INDPAS further allowed us to detect regional differences in <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and in simulated hydrological functioning, despite the rather small differences in the hydroclimatic and topographic setting of the Ruhr headwaters...|$|E

40|$|Sensitivity {{analysis}} of biochemical reactions aims at quantifying {{the dependence of}} the reaction dynamics on the reaction rates. The computation of the <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivities</b> poses many computational challenges when taking stochastic noise into account. This paper proposes a new efficient finite difference method for computing <b>parameter</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of biochemical reactions. We employ propensity bounds of reactions to simulate the nominal and perturbed processes and build the estimator. The exactness of the simulation is reserved by applying the rejection-based mechanism. Our approach reduces the variance of the estimator by exploiting the positive correlation of these processes and improves the performance by skipping the propensity updates. Furthermore, by using propensity bounds to couple processes, our approach allows simultaneous perturbation of many reaction rates in computing the sensitivities, which further improves {{the efficiency of the}} estimator.
