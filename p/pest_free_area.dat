The PFA is aligned to this production area to provide greater fruit ﬂy control measures. The Victorian Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI) and New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (DPI) have implemented stringent legislative controls on the movement of host fruit and vegetables into the PFA to keep it free from the Queensland fruit ﬂy (QFF) and maintain high value markets, which are worth millions of dollars to local industries. The PFA enables commercial horticultural products to be marketed without postharvest chemical treatments for QFF. The PFA follows the course of the Murray River from Kerang to [...] and the Darling River from Wentworth to Pooncarie.|$|E
40|$|The South African citrus {{industry}} is strongly focused on exports and South Africa is a signatory member {{of both the}} World Trade Organisation Agreement on the application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the International Plant Protection Convention. Citrus black spot, caused by Guignardia citricarpa, does not occur in all the South African citrus production areas and, therefore, South Africa {{has a responsibility to}} provide those trading partners that have identified G. citricarpa as a regulated pest with reliable information about the distribution of citrus black spot within South Africa. Detection surveys were conducted in citrus production areas in the Western Cape, Northern Cape and Free State Provinces and appropriate diagnostic protocols were used to ensure reliable detection of G. citricarpa. Trees in commercial orchards and home gardens on farms and in towns of 17, 9 and 5 magisterial districts in the Western Cape, Northern Cape and Free State Provinces, respectively, were sampled between 1995 and 2010. Fruit samples were taken during June and July, and leaf samples from November to January. None of the 3060 fruit and leaf samples collected during these surveys tested positive for G. citricarpa. Phyllosticta capitalensis, a non-pathogenic, ubiquitous, endophytic species was, however, detected during these surveys.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 ’s {{there has been}} a {{proliferation}} of agricultural export programs using a wide variety of phytosanitary measures to mitigate pest risk. Increasingly, importing countries have required oversight by official representatives of their NPPO of the phytosanitary measures imposed in the exporting country. In certain cases, such as the <b>pest</b> <b>free</b> <b>areas</b> in Northern Mexico and apple export program in the Pacific Northwestern United States, the importing country agreed to turn over oversight to the NPPO of the exporting country. But in many export programs, oversight of the export program by the importing country’s NPPO remains. These oversight programs are costly and present a significant barrier to trade, especially in small developing export programs with limited financial resources. Oversight programs could easily be performed by the NPPOs of the exporting country. All three NPPOs of the NAPPO countries are fully developed and staffed with outstanding plant health professionals, capable of enforcing any pest risk mitigation program. All actions or activities done by the importing country’s NPPO in the exporting country could more effectively and efficiently be done by the NPPO of the exporting country, in conjunction with a system of auditing by the importing NPPO. Such oversight is possible for all export programs, whether new or pre-existing; whether based on treatments, systems approaches, or just regulatory inspections. Such a transition in oversight simply needs a clear definition of success, clear expectations, and a mutually agreed system of quality assurance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Potatoes are Egypt’s largest horticultural {{export crop}} Yet, {{the total value}} of Egyptian potato exports fell from a peak value of US $ 102. 12 million in 1995 to $US 7. 7 million in 2000 mainly due to {{quarantine}} restrictions on the potato brown rot imposed by the European Union (EU) which used to account for about 70 - 90 % of Egyptian potato exports. Therefore, The Central Administration for Plant Quarantine (CAPQ) of Ministry of Agriculture, Egypt, has recently set up a new Directorate for Internal Potato Quarantine in order to delimit <b>pest</b> <b>free</b> <b>areas</b> (PFAs), i. e. areas in which Ralstonia solanacearum the pathogen of brown rot has not been was known not to have occurred yet. In order for PFAs to be approved, extensive documentation including detailed maps, cropping pattern, irrigation sources and other relevant information must be submitted to the EU Standing Committee on Plant Health. Integrated management of such a disease including cultural, biological and chemical approaches is presented herein. Recognizing that zero tolerance requires sampling every tuber in the potato lot, the default strategy is to define an acceptable tolerance limit. The binomial probability distribution is presented as a base for determining probabilities of detecting various infestation levels as increasing numbers of samples are collected. Such a method saves time, labor and money in the detection and ensures the relative proportional certainty emanating from the inspected sample to the actual matter. However, a zero tolerance is required for complete eradication of the disease. Neither Poisson nor th...|$|R
40|$|Surely {{the best}} way to meet the enemy is head on in the field and not wait till they plunder our very homes” Oliver Goldsmith (1730 – 1774). Area-wide {{management}} (AWM) of crop pests is an alternative strategy for pest control to reliance on the uncoordinated control decisions of farmers. Relative to uncoordinated pest control, AWM {{has been shown to be}} cost-effective and, by reducing pesticide use, environmentally beneficial. The fact that AWM schemes provide imperfect public goods and are prone to free-riding means that most successful schemes depend on government funding, regulation, coordination and management. The economics of AWM concerns the economics of information and time in complex bioeconomic settings. This paper explores the economics of AWM in relation to Queensland fruit fly (Qfly), Bactrocera tryoni (Frogatt), a damaging pest and a major barrier to Australian trade in horticultural produce. We analyse the economics of roadblocks, surveillance and eradication. The results show that returns from tighter roadblocks are greater than returns from increased surveillance and enhanced eradication capacity. These results depend on market access rules, the spatial extent of the <b>pest</b> <b>free</b> <b>area,</b> the horticultural commodities at risk, and pest ecology. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Information on {{population}} growth and spread of a significant endemic pest such as the Queensland fruit fly (Qfly; Bactrocera tryoni) is highly valuable to biosecurity regulators wanting to evaluate the benefits of surveillance under horticultural Area Wide Management (AWM) schemes. Unfortunately, directly observing a growth model or surveillance performance is not possible due to data constraints. This paper presents a set of novel methods to infer key population and surveillance parameters from available data for a jump-diffusion model. This will {{form the basis of}} an economic analysis of AWM for the Sunraysia <b>Pest</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Area</b> (PFA) across south east NSW and north west Victoria. A number of jump-diffusion models of invasive species have now been implemented to represent the different modes of dispersal available to an invasive species. However, as models become more sophisticated we encounter the perennial problem of model calibration. We implement a hierarchical model composed first of landscape 'ju mps' by Qfly into the PFA, and represented by a time and spatially varying probability of declarable outbreaks derived from ∼ 150000 monitoring events since 1998. The jumps are climate driven, with a set of time-varying Climex indices of climate, and dependent on land use, road density and other geographic factors. Here, calibration of the 'jumps' is by estimating a generalized additive model. Assigned to each outbreak incident is an outbreak 'duration'. This duration attribute is of key interest as it will largely determine variable costs in a proposed Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) of the surveillance methodology and new technologies. Early detection is often associated with smaller populations, lower control costs and more rapid control, and hence a decreased duration. The duration attribute is thus modeled directly {{as a function of the}} number of Qfly initially captured. Initial captures can in turn be modeled through an integro-difference model of local {{population growth and}} diffusion. However, (i) the initial location of outbreaks are unknown; (ii) the probability of detection by the monitoring network needs to be estimated; (iii) the local landscape is assumed homogeneous in the absence of further information; and, (iv) local population growth and dispersal are known to be time-varying. Ad hoc calibration methods such as least squares optimization or regression modelling were used to derive both a time invariant, half Cauchy dispersal kernel and the probability of detecting a local Qfly population, by drawing on results from the published literature. Both of these ad hoc calibrations suffer from significant bias which in future only spatially referenced and time stamped capture data can resolve. Population growth parameters for the integro-difference model were generated from an existing stage-structured and spatially non-explicit model of Qfly population dynamics. A metamodel enabled these growth parameters to be linked to the weekly Climex indices. A time-varying distribution of initial population numbers at time of arrival (i. e. before detection), and a consequent distribution for the time to population detection, could then be simulated. The full procedure allows elements of a monitoring regime, such as the detection efficiency of individual traps or trap density, to be economically valued in future work. While some of the calibrations in this paper are data constrained, data needs for implementation of integro-difference models in the economic valuation of monitoring networks are clear: georeferencing and time stamping of captures, experimental controls for determining growth and mortality, and ease of accessibility to such data to facilitate ready modeling. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Fruit flies cause {{losses in}} horticultural produce {{across the world}} and are a major {{quarantine}} concern for most countries. Queensland fruit fly (Qfly) is a native to Australia and is also present in {{a small number of}} Pacific Island countries. The detection of Qfly in recognized <b>pest</b> <b>free</b> <b>areas</b> triggers quarantine restrictions from domestic and international markets. In Australia, the detection of five male flies has been taken to indicate an outbreak (i. e. unacceptable risk). Matching the domestic standard, many countries have accepted the 5 -fly limit as a quarantine threshold. But some other countries have set the detection of two male flies, or even a single fly, as the threshold for an outbreak. This different standard creates an administrative complexity for exporters and trade regulators. In this paper, we review the published science covering the impediments to pest establishment. Outbreak data from Victoria and New South Wales during 2007 and 2009 are reviewed in relation to the 2 -fly and 5 -fly thresholds. Large volumes of fruit have been traded within Australia and internationally based on the 5 -fly threshold without incident and {{there is no evidence that}} the 2 -fly threshold is more appropriate. While Qfly is recognized as being capable of longer distance dispersal than some other fruit fly species, it is also recognized as a poor colonizer. The 5 -fly threshold is proposed as the most appropriate threshold for imposition of quarantine restrictions and is recommended as a universal standard for harmonization of quarantine regulations. 7 page(s...|$|R

Establishment is rated as very likely because both species have established populations in most countries of the EU, with transient populations occurring outdoors in non-Mediterranean areas. Spread within the EU is considered to be likely because the pests can readily be moved with plant material. The magnitude of the potential consequences is rated as minor for both species in Mediterranean areas. In non-Mediterranean countries it is moderate for both species in protected crops but, outdoors, impacts are minor for L. huidobrensis and minimal for L. trifolii. The current regulations to prevent entry and spread were found to be only partially effective as interceptions are still being made, cut branches with foliage and leafy vegetables other than celery are excluded, and the methods for inspection and the treatments required to confirm <b>pest</b> <b>free</b> <b>areas,</b> places of production and consignments are not clearly specified.

40|$|Potato {{brown rot}} disease (Ralstonia solanacearum) {{is a serious}} {{economic}} problem in Egypt, partly due to an European Union requirement that potatoes for export to the EU should be grown in so-called <b>pest</b> <b>free</b> <b>area's</b> (PFA's), where fields are tested and infested fields are put under quarantine measures. To investigate pathogen survival and to determine {{the time required to}} keep infested fields in quarantine, the survival of R. solanacearum race 3 biovar 2 was tested in soils differing in origin (Dutch versus Egyptian soils), soil type (sand versus clay), and management type (organic versus conventional). All eight soils were tested at moderate (15 ??C) and elevated temperatures (28 ??C). Also the effects of artificial fertilizer and organic (compost and cow manure) amendments on survival of R. solanacearum were tested. In all soils, with and without amendments, the pathogen dropped below the detection limit (102 CFU g- 1 d. w. soil) within 5 months. At both temperatures, all Egyptian soils showed a significantly faster decline in pathogen density than the Dutch soils. The decline in colony forming units of R. solanacearum per gram of soil was faster in sandy soils than in clay soils from both countries. Management effects on decline of R. solanacearum were smaller and less consistent: for some soils, organic management resulted in a significantly shorter 50 %-reduction-time and/or greater decline rate than conventional management, for other soils the differences were not significant. Survival periods at 15 ??C were longer than at 28 ??C in Dutch soils, but not in Egyptian soils, where survival was slightly shorter at the lower temperature. Amendments with NPK fertilizer to the conventional soils and with cow manure to the organic soils enhanced the decline rate of R. solanacearum in these soils. The decline rate of the pathogen was negatively correlated with total soluble organic matter and positively with bacterial diversity. In conclusion, the overriding factors determining survival of R. solanacearum in soil may be the production of toxic concentrations of ammonia on the one hand, and availability of substrate in combination with microbial competition on the other hand. The sandy desert soils of Egypt are very suitable for production of export potatoes because the pathogen would survive for only a relatively short period in those soils, if it were accidentally introduced. Addition of ammonia-producing amendments can reduce populations of R. solanacearum, whereas compost addition and organic management do not necessarily result in an enhanced decline of the pathogen. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.
