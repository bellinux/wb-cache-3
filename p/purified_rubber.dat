40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the pectic enzyme polygalacturonase (PG) of Phytophthora meadii isolates from petioles of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) genotypes were compared in relation to (i) aggressiveness (virulence) in infecting detached petioles of a susceptible rubber genotype (PB 86) or (ii) {{in relation to the}} availability of <b>purified</b> <b>rubber</b> petiole cell walls (obtained from a Phytophthora-resistant clone, RRIC 100) in the growth medium, as the sole carbon source. The four most highly aggressive isolates produced PG forms varying within mw 48 - 60 kDa, while, the highly aggressive MAD 86 isolate produced two PG forms of mw 48 and 70 kDa. Moderately or weakly aggressive isolates produced PG forms within the range of 62 - 66 kDa. With rubber petiole cell walls in the growth medium, the four most highly aggressive isolates produced PG forms of mw 42 - 62 kDa, while, MAD 86 produced a much smaller PG form of 21 kDa. Weak or moderately aggressive isolates produced similar PG forms in both cell wall and pectin media. Quite smaller PG molecules produced in rubber cell wall medium could be due to elicitor molecular fragments bound to rubber cell walls, which may induce P. meadii to secret specific PG forms via signal transduction pathway. None of the isolates produced pectin lyase (PL) in any growth medium. Neither PG nor PL activity was detected in P. meadii-infected petioles.

40|$|Physicochemical {{properties}} of biodiesel from vegetable oils {{depend on the}} inherent {{properties of}} the oil-producing seeds. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the physicochemical properties of biodiesels extracted from calabash and rubber seeds oils, as well as their combined oil mixtures with a view to ascertaining the most suitable for biodiesel production. Calabash and rubber seeds oils were separately extracted through the use of a mechanical press with periodic addition of water. Biodiesels were produced from each category of the oils by transesterification of the free fatty acid (FFA) with alcohol under the influence of a catalyst in batch process. The physicochemical properties of the biodiesels were investigated and comparatively analysed. The results obtained indicated an average of 1. 40 wt% FFA for biodiesel produced from the purified calabash oil, which has a specific gravity of 0. 920, pH of 5. 93, flash point of 116 0 C, fire point of 138 0 C, cloud point of 70 0 C, pour point of - 4 0 C, moisture content of 0. 82 wt% and specific heat capacity of 5301 J/kgK. Conversely, the results obtained for biodiesel produced from the <b>purified</b> <b>rubber</b> oil showed an average of 33. 66 wt% FFA, specific gravity of 0. 885, pH of 5. 51, flash point of 145 0 C, fire point of 170 0 C, cloud point of 10 0 C, pour point of 4 0 C, moisture content of 1. 30 wt% and specific heat capacity of 9317 J/kgK. However, results obtained for biodiesel produced from the combined oil mixtures indicated an average of 19. 77 wt% FFA content, specific gravity of 0. 904, API gravity of 25. 036, pH value of 5. 73, flash point of 157 0 C, Fire point of 180 0 C, cloud point of 9 0 C, pour point of 5 0 C, moisture content of 0. 93 wt% and specific heat capacity of 6051 J/kgK. Biodiesel produced from calabash seed oil is superior in quality to rubber seed oil, particularly in terms of its low FFA and moisture contents...|$|E

Ten isolates reduced the weight of vulcanized rubber from latex gloves by > 10 % in 6 weeks. Scanning electron microscopy clearly revealed the ability of the microorganisms to colonize, penetrate, and dramatically alter the physical structure of the rubber. The rubber-metabolizing bacteria were identified on the basis of fatty acid profiles and cell wall characteristics.

50|$|Catalytic {{distillation}} is {{a branch}} of reactive distillation which combines the processes of distillation and catalysis to selectively separate mixtures within solutions. Its main function is to maximize the yield of catalytic organic reactions, such as the refining of gasoline.The earliest case of catalytic distillation was thought to have dated back to 1966; however, the idea was officially patented in 1980 by Lawrence A. Smith, Jr. The process is currently used to <b>purify</b> gasoline, extract <b>rubber,</b> and form plastics.|$|R
40|$|The {{reinforcement}} of natural rubber (NR) with particles and fibres enables {{their use in}} even high performance applications, such as in road-racing bicycle tire casings. Here, for the first time, we examine the potential of silk textiles as reinforcements in NR to produce a fully-green, flexible yet strengthened elastomeric composite material. Various material properties were evaluated and compared with similar nylon textile reinforced NR composites. Two types of NR were used: whole and <b>purified</b> natural <b>rubbers.</b> The composite samples were prepared by sandwiching a single layer of textile between layers of NR. NR/silk composites exhibited higher static and dynamic mechanical properties than NR/nylon composites. In addition, silk textiles in whole NR composites performed significantly better than purified NR composites, due to stronger fibre/matrix adhesion and better wettability in the former, as indicated by surface energy measurements and scanning electron microscopy micrographs. Such bio-based natural rubber/silk composites might find interesting applications in soft robotics and as flexible, inflatable tubes...|$|R

Seven isolates were strains of Streptomyces, two were strains of Amycolatopsis, and one was a strain of Nocardia. Natural rubber, consisting mainly of cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene, is relatively resistant to microbial decomposition by comparison with many other natural polymers. Nonetheless, a number of microorganisms have been reported to deteriorate natural rub-ber and to grow in association with it (1, 9, 11, 17, 27, 28). Tsuchii et al. reported a Xanthomonas strain that excreted a rubber-degrading enzyme (26) and a Nocardia strain able to use natural rubber as its sole carbon source (25).
