2500|$|The {{practice}} of naming kinds of noise after colors started with white noise, a signal whose spectrum has equal power within any equal interval of frequencies. [...] That name {{was given by}} analogy with white light, which was (incorrectly) assumed {{to have such a}} flat power spectrum over the visible range. Other color names, like pink, red, and blue were then given to noise with other spectral profiles, often (but not always) in reference to the color of light with similar spectra. Some of those names have standard definitions in certain disciplines, while others are very informal and poorly defined. Many of these definitions assume a signal with components at all frequencies, with a <b>power</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> per unit of bandwidth proportional to 1/f'β and hence they are examples of power-law noise. [...] For instance, the spectral density of white noise is flat (β = 0), while flicker or pink noise has β = 1, and Brownian noise has β = 2.|$|E
2500|$|White {{noise is}} a signal (or process), named by analogy to white light, {{with a flat}} {{frequency}} spectrum when plotted as a linear function of frequency (e.g., in Hz). In other words, the signal has equal power in any band of a given bandwidth (<b>power</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>density)</b> when the bandwidth is measured in Hz. [...] For example, with a white noise audio signal, the range of frequencies between 40 Hz and 60Hz contains {{the same amount of}} sound power as the range between 400Hz and 420Hz, since both intervals are 20Hz wide. Note that spectra are often plotted with a logarithmic frequency axis rather than a linear one, in which case equal physical widths on the printed or displayed plot do not all have the same bandwidth, with the same physical width covering more Hz at higher frequencies than at lower frequencies. In this case a white noise spectrum that is equally sampled in the logarithm of frequency (i.e., equally sampled on the X axis) will slope upwards at higher frequencies rather than being flat. However it is not unusual in practice for spectra to be calculated using linearly-spaced frequency samples but plotted on a logarithmic frequency axis, potentially leading to misunderstandings and confusion if the distinction between equally spaced linear frequency samples and equally spaced logarithmic frequency samples is not kept in mind.|$|E
