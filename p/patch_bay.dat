25|$|Originally {{designed}} by Mardas, of Apple Electronics, the initial installation {{proved to be}} unworkable − with almost no standard studio features such as a <b>patch</b> <b>bay,</b> or a talkback system between the studio and the control room, let alone Alex's promised innovations − {{and had to be}} scrapped. Nevertheless, the Beatles recorded and filmed portions of their album Let It Be in the Apple Studio, with equipment borrowed from EMI; during takes they had to shut down the building's central heating, also located in the basement, because the lack of soundproofing allowed the heating system to be heard in the studio.|$|E
500|$|Mardas {{gave the}} Beatles regular reports of his progress, {{but when they}} {{required}} their new studio in January 1969, during the Get Back project that became Let It Be, they discovered an unusable studio: no 72-track tape deck (Mardas had reduced it to 16 tracks), no soundproofing, no talkback (intercom) system, and not even a <b>patch</b> <b>bay</b> to run the wiring between the control room and the 16 speakers that Mardas had fixed haphazardly to the walls. The only new piece of sound equipment present was a crude mixing console which Mardas had built, which looked (in the words of Martin's assistant, Dave Harries) like [...] "bits of wood and an old oscilloscope". The console was scrapped after just one session. Harrison said it was [...] "chaos", {{and that they had}} to [...] "rip it all out and start again," [...] calling it [...] "the biggest disaster of all time." [...] Harrison's suspicions of Mardas' competence had been raised when he saw him wandering around in a white coat with a clipboard, and considered the possibility that Mardas had [...] "just read the latest version of Science Weekly, and used its ideas". Mardas later stated that he had never been in the basement of Savile Row, as the studio equipment he was building was being tested in Apple Electronics, at Boston Place, Marylebone.|$|E

2500|$|More {{expensive}} amplifiers {{may have}} a <b>patch</b> <b>bay</b> for multiple inputs and outputs, such as a pre-amp out (for sending to another guitar amplifier), a second low gain input, to use with active basses, an in jack to create an effects loop (when used with the pre-amp out jack), an external speaker output (for powering an additional speaker cabinet), and stereo RCA jacks or an 1/8" [...] jack, for connecting a CD player or MP3 player so that a player can practice along with recorded music. Some amps have a 1/4" [...] jack for connecting a pedal to turn the amp's onboard overdrive and reverb on and off or to switch between channels. Some amps have an XLR jack for a microphone, either for the guitar amp {{to be used for}} singing (in effect as a mini-PA system, or, for acoustic guitar, to mix a mic signal with a pickup signal.|$|E

50|$|Each {{device in}} a daisy chain adds delay to the system. This is avoided with a MIDI thru box, which {{contains}} several outputs that provide an exact {{copy of the}} box's input signal. A MIDI merger is able to combine the input from multiple devices into a single stream, and allows multiple controllers {{to be connected to}} a single device. A MIDI switcher allows switching between multiple devices, and eliminates the need to physically repatch cables. MIDI <b>patch</b> <b>bays</b> combine all of these functions. They contain multiple inputs and outputs, and allow any combination of input channels to be routed to any combination of output channels. Routing setups can be created using computer software, stored in memory, and selected by MIDI program change commands. This enables the devices to function as standalone MIDI routers in situations where no computer is present. MIDI <b>patch</b> <b>bays</b> also clean up any skewing of MIDI data bits that occurs at the input stage.|$|R

50|$|For convenience, some mixing {{consoles}} include inserts or a <b>patch</b> <b>bay</b> or patch panel. Patch bays {{are mainly}} used for recording mixers. However, live sound mixers may also include patch bays. In live sound, the cables from the onstage microphones and instrument outputs are not typically plugged {{directly into the}} mixer, because this would require {{a large number of}} cables to go from the stage the mixer. Instead, the onstage mic and instrument cables are typically plugged into the <b>patch</b> <b>bay</b> of a thick snake cable, which runs from the stage to the mixer. The outputs from the snake's second <b>patch</b> <b>bay</b> (near the mixer) are then plugged into the mixer.|$|E

50|$|A {{distinctive}} {{design feature}} of the VCS3 (and later EMS systems) was that, rather than using patch cords to route audio and control signals between modules, Cockerell employed a small matrix plugboard into which the user stuck special conductive pins that connected an input (listed on the X-axis of the matrix) to an output (on the Y-axis). This matrix patchboard gave the VCS3 {{a high degree of}} inter-connectivity, comparable to that of much larger modular systems, and far greater than similar small synthesisers like the Minimoog. It was also much easier to examine than the tangle of patch cords used to interconnect other modular systems of the day, such as the Moog modular synthesizer and was many times smaller than the cumbersome Moog <b>patch</b> <b>bays,</b> which used <b>patch</b> cord leads capped with 1/4-inch 'phone' jacks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{professional}} audio {{field and}} the telecommunication industry use tiny telephone (TT) connectors in <b>patch</b> <b>bays.</b> These are mid-size TS or TRS phone plugs with a 4.40 mm diameter shaft and a slightly different geometry. In the telecommunications field this is termed a [...] "bantam" [...] plug. The three-conductor (TRS for Tip-Ring-Shield) versions are capable of handling balanced line signals and are used in professional audio installations. Though unable to handle as much power, and less reliable than a 6.35 mm jack, TT connectors are used for professional console and outboard patchbays in studio and live sound applications, where large numbers of patch points are needed in a limited space. The slightly different shape of bantam plugs is also less likely to cause shorting as they are plugged in.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the rear}} of the DX-7 is a small <b>patch</b> <b>bay</b> {{providing}} various input and output jacks. These include two jacks for a piano damper pedal-style momentary switch pedal (one for portamento, an effect that makes one note [...] "glide" [...] up or down in pitch to the next note, and a second jack for sustain, which holds any notes that the performer was pressing at the time she/he depresses the sustain pedal); two expression pedal jacks for modulation and volume (loudness and softness); and an output jack, which can be connected to a keyboard amplifier and loudspeaker, PA system or sound recording system. All of the jacks on the <b>patch</b> <b>bay</b> are standard 1/4" [...] jacks. The external pedals must be purchased separately. For the output jack, the performer needs a standard 1/4" [...] patch cord. To connect the DX-7 to an audio console (mixing board), a DI unit may be needed to convert the signal to a level that is appropriate for mixers.|$|E
