5000|$|Moriarty {{commissioned}} {{new music}} {{for many of}} her Irish ballets. Elizabeth Maconchy, Seán Ó Riada and A. J. Potter orchestrated works originally written for the piano: Puck Fair (1948), Papillons (1952), and Full Moon for the Bride (1974). Redmond Friel composed the music for The Children of Lír (1950). Three ballets were set to Seán Ó Riada's music: West Cork Ballad (1961), Devil to Pay (1962), Lugh of the Golden Arm (1977); these were performed by the Ceoltóirí Chualann and Éamon de Buitléar's Ceoltóirí Laighean. The Chieftains arranged traditional music for The Playboy of the Western World. Bernard Geary wrote the music for two ballets choreographed by Geoffrey Davidson for Irish Theatre Ballet: Bitter Aloes and Il Cassone. Aloys Fleischmann composed the music for six Moriarty ballets: The Golden Bell of Ko (1948), An Cóitín Dearg Red Petticoat (1951), Macha Ruadh Macha (1955), the two folk ballets Bata na bPlanndála <b>Planting</b> <b>Stick</b> (1957) and Suite: The Cake Dance (1957) and The Táin (1981). This three-act ballet was commissioned by the Dublin Theatre Festival and premiered at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, on 6 October 1981, the Irish Ballet Company performing with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra under Proinnsias Ó Duinn.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the findings of}} the research carried out on agricultural tools and machinery used by Samoan subsistence farmers to cultivate and harvest crops like taro (Colocasia esculents var. esculenta), banana (musa spp.), ta’amu (Alocasia macrorhiza) breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), yam (Discorea spp.) and coconut (Cocosnucifera). The research was conducted by interviewing farmers chosen by field officers who work directly with them on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture in Samoa. The information collected focused on the type of tool, implement or machine that the farmer owned or has access to, its effectiveness, susceptibility to breakdowns, maintenance issues, ease of repair and availability of spare parts. In general the level of engineering inputs employed in the production of these crops is low and confined mainly to the bushknife, metal tip for <b>planting</b> <b>stick,</b> spade, the lower – operated knapsack sprayer and the mist blower...|$|E

40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{profound}} and direct impacts of climate change {{over the next few}} decades will be on agricultural and food systems. On page 607 of this issue, Lobell et al. (1) show that increasing temperatures and declining precipitation over semiarid regions are likely to reduce yields for corn, wheat, rice, and other primary crops in the next two decades. These changes could have a substantial impact on global food security. Since the 1990 s, rising commodity prices and declining per capita cultivated area have led to decreases in food production, eroding food security in many communities (2). Many regions that lack food security rely on local agricultural production to meet their food needs. Primarily tropical and subtropical, these regions are substantially affected by both global climate variations and global commodity price fluctuations. Warming in the Indian Ocean (3) and an increasingly “El Nino–like” climate (4) could reduce main-season precipitation across parts of the Americas, Africa, and Asia (see the figure). In food-insecure regions, many farmers both consume their product and sell it in local markets. This exposes farmers to climate variations, because when they produce less their income goes down while their costs go up to maintain basic consumption. Large-scale hunger can ensue, even when there is sufficient food in the market that has been imported from elsewhere. National revenue can also be affected by large-scale droughts, which restrict the ability of countries with small budgets to purchase grain on the international market. Thus, recent large increases in grain prices reduce access to food for the poor, for example, in Tanzania, who compete for corn with ethanol producers and hog farmers in the United States. Finally, up to half of all malnutrition is driven by nonfood factors through diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria; the latter disease is likely to become more severe and widespread with warming temperatures. Lobell et al. use crop models to calculate changes in agricultural production to 2030. The results show that climate change is likely to reduce agricultural production, thus reducing food availability. Identifying the impact of this reduced production will, however, be complicated by other changes. The latter include rising oil prices, the globalization of the grain market, and a structural change in demand for key food supplies due to increasing demand for biofuels and rising per-capita consumption in India and China. These changes have pushed up supply costs for staple foods by 40 % or more in many food-insecure areas. Decoupling these effects to implement mitigation and adaptation programs will be difficult. Climate change impacts on farmers will vary by region, depending on their use of technology. Technological sophistication determines a farm’s productivity far more than its climatic and agricultural endowments. Food insecurity, therefore, is not solely a product of “climatic determinism” and can be addressed by improvements in economic, political, and agricultural policies at local and global scales. In currently food-insecure regions, farming is typically conducted manually, using a hoe and <b>planting</b> <b>stick</b> with few inputs. The difference between the productivity of these farms and those using petroleum-based fertilizer and pesticides, biotechnology-enhanced plant varieties, and mechanization is extreme (5). Not only will climate change have a differential effect on ecosystems in the tropics due to their already warmer climates, but also poor farmers in the tropics will be less able to cope with changes in climate because they have far fewer options in their agricultural system to begin with. These handicaps can be exacerbated by macro-economic policies that create disincentives for agricultural development, such as agricultural subsidies in the United States and Europe and poorly implemented cash transfer programs (6) ...|$|E
50|$|During the First World War, {{walking sticks}} were often carried by officers. Such sticks came {{to have a}} new and more {{important}} use with the introduction of tanks, which often became 'bogged' on battlefields, particularly in Flanders. Officers of the Tank Corps used these sticks to probe {{the ground in front of}} their tanks testing for firmness as they went forward. Often, the commanders led their tanks into action on foot. To commemorate this, officers of the Regiment carry ash <b>plant</b> <b>sticks</b> instead of the short cane customary to other arms.|$|R

50|$|The {{people are}} farmers, {{planting}} corn (maize), beans, squash, and cucumbers in steep hillside plots. Burning {{is used to}} clear undergrowth, plows and <b>planting</b> <b>sticks</b> being the chief cultivating implements. Most families keep a cow for milk and cheese, and sheep are sometimes kept for wool; however, very little meat is eaten. Other barnyard animals are also kept, and hunting, fishing, and gathering of wild foods augments farming. Neither the Huichol nor the Cora commonly live in villages but, rather, have households in the countryside clustered in loose groups of 1 to 12; these are called rancherias. Community centres consist of a church or Huicholtemple, public buildings, sometimes schools or jails, and houses that are kept by some families to live in when {{they are at the}} centre. The rancherias may be quite isolated from such community centres.|$|R

40|$|Macular {{amyloidosis}} is {{an important}} cause for cutaneous pigmentation, the aetiology of which is poorly understood. Friction has recently been implicated the causation of early lesions, referred to as frictional amyloidosis. Confirmation of diagnosis by the detect on of amyloid using histochemical stains is inconsistent. Ten patients with pigmentation suggestive of macular amyloidosis were studied with detailed history, clinical examination, biopsy for histochemistry and electron microscopy. Nine out of ten patients {{had a history of}} prolonged friction with various objects such as bath sponges, brushes, towels, <b>plant</b> <b>sticks</b> and leaves. Amyloid was demonstrated by histochemical staining in only six out of ten cases. In the remaining four cases, amyloid was detected by electron microscopy. These consisted of aggregates of non-branching, extracellular, intertwining fibres measuring between 200 - 500 nm in length and between 20 - 25 nm in diameter. The study confirms the role of friction in the causation of this condition. Histochemical stains are not always successful in the detection of amyloid and electron microscopy is helpful for confirming its presence. The term frictional amyloidosis aptly describes the condition...|$|R
