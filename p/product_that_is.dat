Imitation steak is a food <b>product</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> formed into a steak shape from various pieces of meat.

5|$|Armillaria gallica {{can produce}} cyclobutane-containing {{metabolites}} such as arnamiol, a natural <b>product</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{classified as a}} sesquiterpenoid aryl ester. Although the specific function of arnamiol is not definitively known, similar chemicals present in other Armillaria species are thought {{to play a role}} in inhibiting the growth of antagonistic bacteria or fungi, or in killing cells of the host plant prior to infection.|$|E

5|$|While totally {{dominating}} the region's production, sparkling Champagne {{is not the}} only <b>product</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> made from the region's grapes. Non-sparkling still wines, like those made around the village Bouzy, are sold under the appellation label Coteaux Champenois. There is also a rosé appellation in the region, Rosé des Riceys. The regional vin de liqueur is called Ratafia de Champagne. Since the profit of making sparkling Champagne from the region's grape is now much higher, production of these non-sparkling wines and fortified wines is very small.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Puerto Rico in 1859, Betances established {{a very successful}} surgery and ophthalmology practice in Mayagüez. Even fierce political enemies such as Spanish pro-monarchy journalist José Pérez Morís regarded Betances as the best surgeon in Puerto Rico at the time. His good reputation in Puerto Rico would survive his stay in the island nation for many years. In 1895, while Betances was living in Paris, the manufacturers of the Emulsión de Scott (a codfish liver oil <b>product</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> still sold today, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in modern times), paid an endorsement fee to Betances to have him appear on advertisements on Spanish language magazines and newspapers all over New York City and the Caribbean, based on his solid reputation as a doctor.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{manufacturers}} pay {{an annual}} fee of US$10,000 plus a royalty rate of $0.15 per unit, reduced to $0.05 if the HDMI logo is used, and further reduced to $0.04 if HDCP is also implemented. An alternative fee for HDMI manufacturers making fewer than 10,000 units per year is an annual fee of $5,000 with a royalty rate of $1 per unit. The royalty only applies to final products {{and does not}} apply to products that are included in, or with, a licensed HDMI <b>product</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> already subject to the royalty. For example, an HDMI cable sold directly to consumers is paid for by the cable manufacturer; however, if the cable manufacturer sells the HDMI cable to a HDTV manufacturer (who then includes the cable with an HDTV subject to the royalty) then the HDTV manufacturer pays only the royalty on the HDTV.|$|E

25|$|Celgene Corporation {{originally}} synthesized thalidomide using a three-step sequence {{starting with}} L-glutamic acid treatment, {{but this has}} since been reformed {{by the use of}} L-glutamine. As shown in the image below, N-carbethoxyphtalimide (1) can react with L-glutamine to yield N-Phthaloyl-L-glutamine (2). Cyclization of N-Phthaloyl-L-glutamine occurs using carbonyldiimidazole, which then yields thalidomide (3). Celegne Corporation's original method resulted in a 31% yield of S-thalidomide, whereas the two-step synthesis yields 85-93% <b>product</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> 99% pure.|$|E

25|$|Corporations {{manage their}} supply chain to take {{advantage}} of cheaper costs of production. A supply chain is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer. Supply chain activities involve the transformation of natural resources, raw materials, and components into a finished <b>product</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> delivered to the end customer. In sophisticated supply chain systems, used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable. Supply chains link value chains. Supply and demand can be very fickle, depending on factors such as the weather, consumer demand, and large orders placed by multinational corporations.|$|E
