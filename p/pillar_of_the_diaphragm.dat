40|$|AbstractIn bariatric surgery, it is {{essential}} to completely release the Fundus {{in order to create a}} narrow gastric pouch. The upper part of the fundus is located above the omental bursa and is therefore retro-peritoneal. In order to release this completely, not only does the arterial supply to the fundus need to be divided to visualise the left diaphragmatic pillar, but the right attachment beginning at the left diaphragmatic pillar and running towards the fundus needs to be divided. This minimal dissection is compensated by further dissection at the level of the left diaphragmatic pillar and traction on the stomach from right to left during the final division stapling division process. The surgeon still has the impression of having released the posterior aspect of the Fundus, exposing the <b>pillar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> although in fact part of the Fundus still remains adherent to the diaphragm and is therefore not released...|$|E

40|$|Piston {{diaphragm}} {{pumps are}} used world-wide to transport abrasive and/or aggressive slurries against high discharge pressures in the mining, mineral processing and power industries. Limitation of excessive deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is <b>of</b> utmost importance for eliminating fatigue failures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and thereby obtaining a high reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piston <b>diaphragm</b> pump. <b>The</b> deformation shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> a complex 2 -way Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) mechanism within the pump chamber between the propelling fluid, <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and <b>the</b> pumped slurry. <b>The</b> understanding <b>of</b> this FSI mechanism has improved {{in the last}} decades but is still limited.

50|$|In {{addition}} to phase differences, amplitude differences also result in pressure differences across <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> This amplitude component {{arises from the}} fact that <b>the</b> far side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is farther from the sound source than the front side. Since sound pressure level decreases as <b>the</b> inverse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance from the source (it is sound intensity level that drops as <b>the</b> inverse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance squared, for those familiar with the inverse square law), <b>the</b> amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sound will be slightly less at <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> as compared to <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> Since <b>the</b> pressure difference due to the amplitude component is dependent only on the amplitude differential with respect to <b>the</b> two sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> it is independent of frequency, per se.|$|R
