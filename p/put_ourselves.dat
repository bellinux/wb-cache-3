40|$|In {{his recent}} book Reflective Democracy, Robert Goodin argues that 'external-collaborative' models of {{democratic}} deliberation procedures need to be supplemented by 'internal-reflective' deliberation. The exercise of the moral imagination plays {{a central role in}} Goodin's account of 'democratic deliberation within'. By imaginatively <b>putting</b> <b>ourselves</b> in the place of a range of others, he argues, including those who maybe not be able to represent their own interests, we can make their points of view 'communicatively present' in deliberation. Goodin's argument emphasizes the role of art and other forms of cultural representation in helping to bring about this expansion of moral imagination. Drawing on debates in philosophy of mind concerning the scope and limits of our capacities to simulate other minds, I argue that Goodin's analysis of 'democratic deliberation within' conflates different kinds of imaginative project. In doing so, it underestimates both the difficulties of imaginatively <b>putting</b> <b>ourselves</b> in the place of others and the political risks in doing so. I argue, alternatively, that moral engagement with others involves the capacity for sympathy and that art and other forms of cultural representation can enlarge the scope of our sympathies, by assisting us to overcome imaginative resistance to alien points of view. In developing this argument, I provide a qualified defense of Iris Young's claim that respect for others involves 'asymmetrical reciprocity'. 33 page(s...|$|R

Drawing on Merleau-Ponty's (1962) existential phenomenology, the author elaborates an alternative version of construing other's constructions. In this model, playing a role with another involves all the person's processes, without giving undue emphasis to the cognitive functions of deliberation and imagination.

40|$|Sciences is an intriguing, systematic, {{and careful}} {{analysis}} of empathy: <b>putting</b> <b>ourselves</b> in another person’s shoes. Over {{the past two}} decades, empathy as received considerable philosophical attention thanks to the contemporary interdisciplinary debate regarding the development of folk psychology, specifically between theory–theory and simulation theory. And it’s within this context that Stueber passionately argues that empathy, not theories, {{play a central role}} in understanding humans from both a folk psychological and social scientific point of view. Although Rediscovering Empathy offers a wide ranging discussion of empathy, its main thesis states that “empathy must be regarded as the epistemically central, default method for understanding other agents within the folk–psychological framework ” (p. 5). In short, it’s by <b>putting</b> <b>ourselves</b> in another’s shoes that we come to understand human behaviour. In the introduction to his book, Stueber outlines a number of objections against empathy. First, from a Cartesian point of view, there is little reason to suppose empathy will give us accurate knowledge of other person’s mental states if we cannot use knowledge of our own mind to gain knowledge of other minds. Second, empathy is an imperfect method of knowing other mind, especially when radical cultural differences between agents could prevent them from putting themselves into another person’s shoes. And, third, empathy provides little epistemic justification for other person’s actions unless supplemented with general explanatory principles or theories. The result, as Stueber explains, is that “most philosophers of social science would regard betting on empathy as central to gaining knowledge of other minds as the equivalent of betting on a dead horse ” (p. 16). Stueber’s ambitious thesis also runs counter to those philosophers and psychologists supporting folk psychology as either theoretical (Churchlan...|$|R
