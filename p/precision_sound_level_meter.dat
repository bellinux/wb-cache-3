The objectives of the article were to monitor and to assess the existing noise levels at the selected sites. A modular <b>precision</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>Level</b> <b>Meter</b> (SLM) Type One {{was used in the}} measurements. The measurements were taken for 24 –hours in the residential area and from 6 am to 7 pm in the school area (schooling hours). The measurements were taken at an interval of ten minutes and each measurement lasted for five minutes at appropriate points in accordance with ISO 1996 - 1 : 1982, ISO 1996 - 2 : 1987 and ISO 19896 - 3 : 1987. Equivalent Continuous Sound Level (Leq), Sound Level exceeded 10 % of the measurement period (L 10), Sound Level exceeded 90 % of the measurement (L 90), minimum noise level (Lmin) and maximum noise level (Lmax) were measured to assist in assessing the existing noise levels at the selected sites. Results showed that the monitored noise levels in terms of Leq, in residential area ranged between 52. 1 dB(A) to 72. 7 dB (A) and in the school area ranged between 68. 2 dB(A) to 73. 7 dB(A). These levels highly exceeded the level recommended by the World Health Organization (p ≤ 0. 001). These noise levels cause sleeping disturbance, interfere with speech communication and message extraction. The main causes of such noise levels are related to transportation system, motor vehicles and traffic supported by poor urban planning.

This paper examines the levels of noise in dining areas during peak hours in different types of restaurants in Hong Kong SAR, China. A mathematical model that describes the noise level in a restaurant is presented. The 1 -h equivalent continuous noise level (Leq, 1 -h) was measured using a Type- 1 <b>precision</b> integral <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter</b> while the occupancy density, the floor area of the dining area, and the ceiling height {{of each of the}} surveyed restaurants were recorded. It was found that the measured noise levels using Leq, 1 -h ranged from 67. 6 to 79. 3 dBA in Chinese restaurants, from 69. 1 to 79. 1 dBA in fast food restaurants, and from 66. 7 to 82. 6 dBA in Western restaurants. Results of the analysis of variance show that {{there were no significant differences}} between means of the measured noise levels among different types of restaurants. A stepwise multiple regression analysis was employed to determine the relationships between geometrical and operational parameters and the measured noise levels. Results of the regression analysis show that the measured noise levels depended on the levels of occupancy density only. By reconciling the measured noise levels and the mathematical model, it was found that people in restaurants increased their voice levels when the occupancy density increased. Nevertheless, the maximum measured hourly noise level indicated that the noise exposure experienced by restaurant service employees was below the regulated daily noise exposure value level of 85 dBA...|$|R

Questionnaire/interview schedules containing pertinent questions were administered randomly to 500 respondents of age 15 year and above, who were also with a good level of literacy skills (reading writing) and leaving in houses sited along or parallel to busy road, with heavy traffic volume for at least three (3) years. The questionnaires provided the psycho-social responses of respondents used in this study, their reactions to road traffic noise effect on communication activities (listening to radio, listening and watching television, verbal communication between individuals, speech communication and telephone/GSM communication). Acoustical measurements were made at the facades of respondents' houses facing the road using <b>precision</b> digital <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter,</b> Bruel and Kjaer (B & K) type 732 following ISO standards 1996. The meter read the road traffic noise levels at measurement sites (facades of respondents' houses). From the results obtained in this study residents of Calabar City suffer serious communication interferences as a result of excessive road traffic noise levels. The noise indices used for this study were LAeq and Ldn. Noise levels obtained were over 93 dB(A) (daytime) and 60 dB(A), (nighttime) for LAeq and 80 dB(A) for Ldn. These far exceeded the recommended theoretical values of 45 - 55 and 70 dB(A), for LAeqand Ldn respectively. A-weighted <b>sound</b> pressure <b>level</b> (SPLS) range between 87. 0 and 100. 0 dB(A). In this study it was also observed that over 98 % of the respondents reported their television watching/radio listening disturbed, 99 % recorded telephone/GSM disturbed, and 98 % reported face-to-face verbal conversation disturbed, and 98 % reported speech communication disturbed. The background noise levels (BNLs) of measurement sites range from 54. 5 to 63. 4 dB(A).

This paper concerns the analysis of the noise risk arising from the use of a tracklaying tractor during field operations carried out in the vineyard. The objective of this study was to evaluate the noise level that comes close to the ear of the operator driving the tractor measuring the values of equivalent <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> (Leq(A)) and peak sound pressure (LCpk). We considered four options related to the same tractor coupled with the following tools to perform some farming operations: rototilling, chisel plough, flail mowers and vibro farmer.

Also noise in agriculture {{is one of the}} risk factors {{to be taken into account}} for the evaluation of workers health and safety. In particular, one of the major sources of discomfort for the workers operating a tractor is the noise to which they are subjected during work. In Italy, Law Decree 81 / 2008 has defined the obligations of vibration and noise assessment and risk management. The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk of {{exposure to}} whole-body vibration for the operator driving a tracklaying tractor working in vineyard orchard and the noise level close to the ear of the operator driving the tractor. The experimental tests were performed using six different tracklaying tractors, 40 - 51 kW power, coupled with the same rototilling machine model BF 160 by Celli (Forlì, Italy). For the evaluation of whole-body vibration we referred to ISO 2631 - 1 : 2008 standard. The tests for noise evaluation were performed in compliance with the standards ISO 9612 and ISO 9432. During the tests we used the porta-ble vibration analyzer HD 2070 by Delta OHM, Italy, that is able to perform spectral analysis and statistics simultaneously on three channels, and a <b>precision</b> integrating portable <b>sound</b> <b>level</b> <b>meter,</b> class 1, model HD 2110 L by Delta OHM, Italy.

This study allowed us to point out that in the use of tracklaying tractors coupled to a rototilling machine, the vibration values referred to the 8 -hour working day were always higher than 0. 5 m s- 2 and, therefore, included in the "risk threshold" identified by Italian Law Decree 81 / 2008.
