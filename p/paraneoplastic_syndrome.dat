5|$|Lambert–Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) {{is a rare}} autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} muscle weakness of the limbs. It {{is the result of}} an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies are formed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The prevalence is 3.4 cases per million. Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndrome</b> (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body).|$|E

This review examines all published cases of <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes</b> associated with neuroendocrine carcinomas of the larynx. There are a total of ten patients reported with <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes</b> associated with laryngeal neuroendocrine carcinomas in the literature. Of these, nine died and the tenth is alive with liver metastases. There were five cases of small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, four cases of moderately differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma, and one case of well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma associated with <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes.</b> As these syndromes have significant clinical relevance, physicians {{should be aware of the}} possible presence of <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes</b> in the diagnostic process of patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma of the larynx. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|Causes of {{disturbed}} {{blood flow}} include stagnation of blood flow {{past the point}} of injury, or venous stasis which may occur in heart failure, or after long periods of sedentary behaviour, such as sitting on a long airplane flight. Also, atrial fibrillation, causes stagnant blood in the left atrium (LA), or left atrial appendage (LAA), and can lead to a thromboembolism. Cancers or malignancies such as leukemia may cause increased risk of thrombosis by possible activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances (<b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndrome),</b> by external compression on a blood vessel when a solid tumor is present, or (more rarely) extension into the vasculature (for example, renal cell cancers extending into the renal veins). Also, treatments for cancer (radiation, chemotherapy) often cause additional hypercoagulability. There are scores that correlate different aspects of patient data (comorbidities, vital signs, and others) to risk of thrombosis, such as the POMPE-C, which stratifies risk of mortality due to pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer, who typically have higher rates of thrombosis.|$|E

40|$|Recent medical {{advances}} have improved the understanding, diagnosis, {{and treatment of}} <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes.</b> These disorders arise from tumor secretion of hormones, peptides, or cytokines or from immune cross-reactivity between malignant and normal tissues. <b>Paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes</b> may affect diverse organ systems, most notably the endocrine, neurologic, dermatologic, rheumatologic, and hematologic systems. The most commonly associated malignancies include small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, gynecologic tumors, and hematologic malignancies. In some instances, the timely diagnosis of these conditions may lead to detection of an otherwise clinically occult tumor at an early and highly treatable stage. Because <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes</b> often cause considerable morbidity, effective treatment can improve patient quality of life, enhance the delivery of cancer therapy, and prolong survival. Treatments include addressing the underlying malignancy, immunosuppression (for neurologic, dermatologic, and rheumatologic <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes),</b> and correction of electrolyte and hormonal derangements (for endocrine <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes).</b> This review focuses on the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes,</b> with emphasis on those most frequently encountered clinically.

Case presentation A 74 -year-old Caucasian woman presented with a left hilar mass and metastatic disease in the liver and right adrenal gland. The patient complained only of intermittent diarrhea. Her laboratory values exhibited metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyperglycemia.

40|$|<b>Paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes</b> {{consist of}} {{disorders}} that accompany benign and malignant tumours, {{but are not}} directly related to mass effects or invasion by the primary tumour or its metastases. The pathophysiology of mostly <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes</b> is not well known. The usual mechanism of their development is the aberrant production of substances (protein hormones, hormone precursors or hormone-like substances) by tumour tissue or autoimmune disorder. The neurological <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes</b> are autoimmune disorders that can affect almost any part of the nervous system. The endocrine <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes</b> are often certain clinical <b>syndromes</b> like <b>paraneoplastic</b> hypercalcaemia or the aberrant production of hormones by cancers. Many haematologic conditions, including anaemia, leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis, coagulapathy have been reported in association with cancer. Also <b>paraneoplastic</b> rheumatic <b>syndromes</b> have been reported in association of cancer. Skin can be involved in cancer in different ways: by metastases, {{as a part of a}} genetic disorder with a cutaneous component in which there is an inherited predisposition to the later development of malignancy, as a part of an acquired syndrome due to the toxicity of a carcinogen that induces malignant change and accompanying skin changes, as a consequence of immunosuppression, or by the development of specific lesions that occur as a <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes</b> The most frequently diagnosed dermatologic conditions include acrokeratosis paraneoplastica, Sweet’s <b>syndrome</b> and <b>paraneoplastic</b> pemphigus.

40|$|<b>Paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes,</b> {{which are}} {{discussed}} in this paper, are a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with cancer, but not directly caused by the physical effects of the primary tumor or its metastases.

Due to the often similar systemic symptoms {{it is very important to}} evaluate the association of rheumatic diseases and cancer. Most paraneoplastic rheumatologic syndroms are difficult distinguishable from idiopathic rheumatologic disorders.

40|$|BACKGROUND The <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes</b> (PS) are {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} biochemical alterations, signs and symptoms expressive of cancer distance action into the patient’s organism. Sometimes these syndromes can precede the evidence of malignancy even of some years or can correspond to cancer relapse. PS, even being characterized by general symptoms (fever, anorexia, cachexia), may occur with neurological, rheumathological, osteoarticular, vascular, haematological, nephrological and endocrinological/metabolic symptoms; the latter ones are discussed in this article. AIM OF THE STUDY Here we will focus on the most common PS: paraneoplastic hypercalcemia, inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and <b>paraneoplastic</b> Cushing <b>syndrome.</b> CONCLUSIONS Our work can be useful in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of <b>paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes...</b>|$|R

The treatment of ALCL reversed both the HLH and NS findings. This case demonstrates the importance of considering lymphoma in pediatric patients presenting with NS and HLH...|$|R

40|$|Olfactory {{neuroblastoma}} (ONB) {{is a rare}} {{malignant neoplasm}} of sinonasal tract, derived from olfactory epithelium. Uni-lateral nasal obstruction, epistaxis, si-nusitis, and headaches are common symptoms. Olfactory neuroblastoma shows neuroendocrine differentiation and similarly to other neuroendocrine tumors can produce several types of peptic substances and hormones. Ex-cess production of these substances can be responsible for different types of endocrinological paraneoplastic syn-dromes (PNS). Moreover, besides en-docrinological, in ONB may also occur neurological PNS, caused by immune cross-reactivity between tumor and normal host tissues in the nervous sys-tem. <b>Paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes</b> in ONB include: syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH), ectopic ACTH syn-drome (EAS), humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM), hypertension due to catecholamine secretion by tumor, opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia (OMA) and paraneoplastic cerebellar degen-eration. <b>Paraneoplastic</b> <b>syndromes</b> in ONB tend to have atypical features, therefore diagnosis may be difficult.
