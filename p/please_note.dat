25|$|Thus {{the young}} adult human’s fat stores average between about 10–20kg, but varies greatly {{depending}} on age, gender, and individual disposition. By contrast {{the human body}} stores only about 400g of glycogen, of which 300g is locked inside the skeletal muscles and is unavailable to the body as a whole. The 100g or so of glycogen stored in the liver is depleted within one day of starvation. Thereafter the glucose that is released into the blood by the liver for general use by the body tissues, has to be synthesized from the glucogenic amino acids {{and a few other}} gluconeogenic substrates, which do not include fatty acids. <b>Please</b> <b>note</b> however that lipolysis releases glycerol which can enter the pathway of gluconeogenesis.|$|E
