5|$|The CIA's California campus {{also runs}} an {{accelerated}} culinary program {{for students who}} already have at least four {{years of experience in}} foodservice. The program includes the same basic classes as the school's associate degree programs, however the accelerated <b>program</b> <b>does</b> not include the externship requirement, and several classes are run with a faster-paced curriculum or including more in-depth material.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The <b>program</b> <b>does</b> nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E

25|$|Among other things, a {{multiprogramming}} {{operating system}} kernel must {{be responsible for}} managing all system memory which is currently in use by programs.

25|$|Rewards From Us To You is a hotel loyalty {{program for}} {{independent}} hotels in Belgium, Holland, Ireland & the United Kingdom. It {{was founded in}} November 2011 by parent hotel management company PREM Group, who is based in Dublin, Ireland. This <b>program</b> <b>does</b> not issue loyalty cards but does everything electronically through email. This company has over 33 participating hotels and serviced apartments. Guests earn points every time they stay with any hotel in the club. Guests can later redeem free night stays or gift cards. In addition to this all members receive exclusive perks for signing up and staying at the hotel.|$|E
25|$|The {{placement}} delete {{functions are}} called from placement new expressions. In particular, {{they are called}} if the constructor of the object throws an exception. In such a circumstance, {{in order to ensure}} that the <b>program</b> <b>does</b> not incur a memory leak, the placement delete functions are called. A placement new expression first calls the placement operator new function, then calls the constructor of the object upon the raw storage returned from the allocator function. If the constructor throws an exception, it is necessary to deallocate that storage before propagating the exception back to the code that executed the placement new expression, and that is the purpose of the placement delete functions.|$|E
25|$|Responding to the {{criticism}} regarding accusations by several media executives (including Viacom CEO Phillippe Dauman and former Fox Entertainment Group chief operating officer Chase Carey) that it failed to count viewers watching television programs on digital platforms, Nielsen {{executive vice president of}} global product leadership Megan Clarken stated in an April 2015 summit by the Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement that the company is able to count digital viewers in audience and demographic reports, but are unable to do so under the current set of rules devised by networks and advertising industries last revised in 2006. As such, Nielsen can only count viewership for television-originated broadcasts, and must exclude viewers who watch programs on digital platforms if the <b>program</b> <b>does</b> not have an identical advertising load or a linear watermark.|$|E

25|$|For any Type A {{program which}} are {{considered}} to be a high risk of not complying, the OMB Circular A-133 requires that the auditor to perform a compliance audit on that program. For a Type A program that is considered to be of low risk, then the auditor is not required to perform a compliance audit, although the OMB Circular A-133 allows the auditor to do so if he/she chooses to. Although the risk assessment is performed by the auditor based on his/her judgment, the OMB Circular A-133 does have two requirements for a program to be considered low risk. First, the program must have been audited at least once in the last two years, and second, the program must have no audit findings when it was last audited. If the <b>program</b> <b>does</b> not comply with either of these two requirements, it is automatically considered as high risk.|$|E
25|$|While medical {{transcription}} {{does not}} mandate registration or certification, individual MTs may seek out registration/certification for personal or professional reasons. Obtaining a certificate {{from a medical}} transcription training <b>program</b> <b>does</b> not entitle an MT to use the title of Certified Medical Transcriptionist. A Certified Healthcare Documentation Specialist (CHDS) credential can be earned by passing a certification examination conducted solely by the Association for Healthcare Documentation Integrity (AHDI), formerly the American Association for Medical Transcription (AAMT), as the credentialing designation they created. AHDI also offers the credential of Registered Healthcare Documentation Specialist (RHDS). According to AHDI, RHDS is an entry-level credential while the CHDS is an advanced level. AHDI maintains a list of approved medical transcription schools. Generally, certified medical transcriptionists earn more than their non-certified counterparts. It is also notable that training through an educational program that is approved by AHDI will increase the chances of an MT getting certified and getting hired.|$|E
25|$|The C64 {{performs}} a RAM test on power up {{and if a}} RAM error is detected, the amount of free BASIC memory will be lower than the normal 38911 figure. If the faulty chip is in lower memory, then an ?OUT OF MEMORY IN 0 error is displayed rather than the usual BASIC startup banner. The color RAM at $D800 uses a separate 2114 SRAM chip and is directly gated to the VIC-II. Unlike the rest of system RAM, it cannot be banked out by using the $0/$1 register. If a <b>program</b> <b>does</b> not use the BASIC interpreter, RAM {{can be read as}} well as written over that ROM's location. However, this means the character ROM is not available, and the RAM in its place is instead used for the character glyphs. Normally, this RAM is uninitialized, which then results in nothing but random patterns appearing on the screen. This is solved by copying the character ROM into RAM. Most C64 games are written in this way, using tile maps, which require much processor time and memory. The same technique was used earlier in the Atari 8-bit family (1979) and arcade hardware such as Pac-Man (1981).|$|E

25|$|In {{his first}} term, Sharif funded Pakistan's nuclear, missile and space programme, {{as well as}} allotted funds for the science research, {{particularly}} its extension to defence. In May 1998, soon after Indian nuclear tests, Sharif vowed that his country would give a suitable reply to the Indians. On 14 May, Leader of the Opposition Benazir Bhutto and MQM publicly called for the nuclear tests and the public calls for the nuclear test as well began {{to take place in}} Pakistan. When India tested its nuclear weapons the second time, it caused a great alarm in Pakistan and pressure mounted to build on the Prime minister. On 15 May 1998, Sharif called and chaired a National Security Council meeting in Prime minister Secretariat. The Pakistan Armed Forces left the matter to elected Prime minister, though Prime minister Sharif put the Pakistan Armed Forces on high-alert. The discussions went on for a few hours and encompassed the financial, diplomatic, military, strategic and national security concerns. At this sensitive meeting, it has had two important agendas; first, whether or not Pakistan should conduct its nuclear tests to respond to Indian nuclear aggression. And, secondly, if the nuclear testing <b>program</b> <b>does</b> go ahead then which of the government science organisations— the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission or Kahuta Research Laboratories— conduct the nuclear testing as well as leading the nuclear testing program.|$|E

500|$|For example, the {{original}} window system, called 8½, exploited these possibilities as follows. Plan 9 represents the user interface on a terminal {{by means of}} three pseudo-files: , which can be read by a program to get notification of mouse movements and button clicks, , {{which can be used}} to perform textual input/output, and , writing to which enacts graphics operations (see bit blit). The window system multiplexes these devices: when creating a new window to run some program in, it first sets up a new namespace in which , [...] and [...] are connected to itself, hiding the actual device files to which it itself has access. The window system thus receives all input and output commands from the program and handles these appropriately, by sending output to the actual screen device and giving the currently focused program the keyboard and mouse input. The <b>program</b> <b>does</b> not need to know if it is communicating directly with the operating system's device drivers, or with the window system; it only has to assume that its namespace is set up so that these special files provide the kind of input and accept the kind of messages that it expects.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{programs}} (interpreters) that {{simulate the}} execution of whatever source code they are given.
