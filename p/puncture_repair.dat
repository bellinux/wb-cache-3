50|$|In bicycling, a {{saddlebag}} or {{seat bag}} is a bag attached under the saddle or seat. Smaller bags are typically {{used to hold}} a few items such as spare inner tubes, <b>puncture</b> <b>repair</b> kit, tools, rain gear, food, first-aid kit, etc. Seat bags are common on touring bicycles, racing bicycles, and cross country mountain bikes.|$|E
50|$|Tubes made of Hypalon {{are easy}} to {{manufacture}} and can be repaired with simple <b>puncture</b> <b>repair</b> kits. Hypalon is not airtight and so must be combined with Neoprene when used to build tubes. Tubes made with Hypalon and Neoprene layers can last at least 5 years. Hypalon {{is probably the most}} popular material used for the construction of RIBs manufactured in the UK.|$|E

50|$|Many compact cars {{now come}} without a spare tire, but instead come a mini {{compressor}} and a sealant to close small holes and reinflate damaged tires. Motorcycles {{also do not}} have room for spare tires, in which compact kits can make long trips a little safer. Automakers and consumer groups stress inflators are designed to seal minor <b>punctures,</b> not <b>repair</b> a large cut or a damaged sidewall.|$|R
5000|$|In some cases, {{automobiles}} may {{be equipped}} with run-flat tires and thus not require a separate spare tire. Other vehicles may carry a can of tire repair foam, to <b>repair</b> <b>punctured</b> tires, although these often do not work {{in the case of}} larger punctures, and are useless {{in the event of a}} blow-out.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Puncture</b> <b>repair</b> kit with tire levers, {{sandpaper}} {{to clean}} off {{an area of}} the inner tube around the puncture, a tube of rubber solution (vulcanizing fluid), round and oval patches, a metal grater and piece of chalk to make chalk powder (to dust over excess rubber solution). Kits often also include a wax crayon to mark the puncture location.|$|E
50|$|For basic {{maintenance}} and repairs cyclists can carry a pump (or a CO2 cartridge), a <b>puncture</b> <b>repair</b> kit, a spare inner tube, and tire levers {{and a set of}} allen keys. Cycling can be more efficient and comfortable with special shoes, gloves, and shorts. In wet weather, riding can be more tolerable with waterproof clothes, such as cape, jacket, trousers (pants) and overshoes and high-visibility clothing is advisable to reduce the risk from motor vehicle users.|$|E
50|$|The Arts Lab's theatre {{programme}} was controversial {{from its}} start in 1969, with a nude open-air {{performance on the}} Arts Lab's roof by the theatre company Sweetness and Light attracting headlines in the Birmingham Post. By 1971 there was a regular programme of visiting theatre companies - mainly radical performance art {{groups such as the}} People Show, Pip Simmons Theatre Group and John Bull <b>Puncture</b> <b>Repair</b> Kit - together with performances by the Arts Lab's own theatre company Zoo.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent years}} Bicycle Victoria has run regular Ride to Work and Ride to School days to stimulate, with some success, cycle commuting. This is {{assisted}} by {{the formation of}} many workplace Bicycle User Groups (BUGS). The Royal Automobile Club of Victoria (RACV) in 2004 introduced a Bike Assist membership option, to assist cyclists with <b>punctures</b> or basic <b>repairs.</b> The success of Ride to Work Day has since seen it become a national event.|$|R
50|$|Following {{shakedown}} training out of Key West and Norfolk, Tide got underway from Hampton Roads for {{her first}} transatlantic voyage. On 17 July, as she steamed in convoy for North Africa, the minesweeper collided with an infantry landing craft — LCI-267 — which she had just provisioned. Damage to the sweeper included sprung plates and two minor hull <b>punctures</b> which were <b>repaired</b> at sea. Tide arrived at Casablanca on 18 July and was soon on her way again escorting a convoy bound for American ports. During the homeward voyage on 29 July, a sonar contact prompted Tide to drop depth charges on {{what she thought was}} an enemy submarine. Although a later search revealed an oil slick, no submarine sinking was confirmed.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fourteen}} man break, initiated after 14 km, by Martijn Maaskant {{dominated the}} days racing. The group {{was reduced to}} 12 as Mark Cavendish made a tactical decision {{to return to the}} peloton, and Jens Voigt had a <b>puncture</b> inefficiently <b>repaired</b> by the neutral service vehicle, but otherwise remained clear, with a lead that reached nearly nine minutes. Among the escapees were George Hincapie, who started the day in 28th place, 525" [...] behind the leader, and Christophe Le Mével, two places and 38 seconds further back.

He won the stage by 16 seconds, with the peloton recovering enough time to preserve Nocentinis tenure of the yellow jersey by 5 seconds. It was suggested that Garmins role in preventing Hincapie gaining the overall lead was influenced by their rivalry with his , but this was denied.|$|R
50|$|A character-based street theatre which {{developed}} in the 1960s and 1970s was developed by groups like Lumiere and Son, John Bull <b>Puncture</b> <b>Repair</b> Kit, Exploded Eye and Natural Theatre Company. The performances were unannounced and featured characters who acted out a pre-arranged scenario, looking beautiful or surreal or simply just involving passers by in conversation. They did not seek to trick in a Candid Camera way, but rather invited the audience to pretend along with them. No amount of planning or rehearsal could dictate what would happen.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after {{production}} began, however, design flaws became apparent. Although {{the car was}} big and heavy, it used {{a relatively}} small Austin A55 1.5 litre engine, which limited performance. The A55 also provided the transmission and suspension. Another {{problem was that the}} rear wheels were shrouded by body panels and a rear wheel could not be removed (for <b>puncture</b> <b>repair</b> for example) without dropping its axle. The car used fibreglass body panels and was styled as a four seat, two door, coupé with removable hardtop. The wheelbase was 98 inches (2487 mm).

5000|$|The road {{is still}} {{practically}} non-existent for the stretch from Saharanpur to Goripur( [...] Junction of SH 11 connecting to NH 1). Trees are being felled {{on both sides}} of the highway hence there are rubbishes periodically on the highway. The potholes are gigantic, road is not lit at night, long stretches of road without any humans in sight and only 3-4 <b>puncture</b> <b>repair</b> centres en route on this road. The road is so infamous that the rowdy, rusty and daring truck/trailer drivers too avaoid this long stretch of road unless absolutely necessary. Hence, if your car/SUV breaks down on the road there's a remote chance that someone will stop to help you out. Mobile network availability is erratic.

6000|$|The firm of Grubb & Smallways, {{formerly}} Grubb, {{had indeed}} been singularly unlucky {{in the last year}} or so. For many years the business had struggled along with a flavour of romantic insecurity in a small, dissolute-looking shop in the High Street, adorned with brilliantly coloured advertisements of cycles, a display of bells, trouser-clips, oil-cans, pump-clips, frame-cases, wallets, and other accessories, and the announcement of [...] "Bicycles on Hire," [...] "Repairs," [...] "Free inflation," [...] "Petrol," [...] and similar attractions. They were agents for several obscure makes of bicycle,--two samples constituted the stock,--and occasionally they effected a sale; they also <b>repaired</b> <b>punctures</b> and did their best--though luck was not always on their side--with any other repairing that was brought to them. They handled a line of cheap gramophones, and did a little with musical boxes.|$|R
2500|$|The South-eastern Long-eared Bat, Nyctophilus corbeni, has a {{head and}} body length of {{approximately}} 50-75mm and a tail length of about 35-50mm. [...] They {{have a broad}} wing and tail membrane surface which permits slow but highly controllable flight. [...] Males are lighter (11-15g) in weight than females (14-21g). [...] These bats have a broader skull and jaw which along with their larger size makes them more distinguishable from other long-eared bats. [...] The South-eastern Long-eared Bat is classed as a microbat, {{and the majority of}} microbats only have a wingspan of approximately 30cm that stretches from the fingers and then {{down the side of the}} body to the leg; and it is made of remarkable skin that is soft, strong and flexible and is able to <b>repair</b> <b>punctures</b> itself. [...] The bats can control their flight by 'feeling' for turbulence thanks to being covered with tiny touch receptors which are small bumps with tiny hairs protruding from the centre, which are sensitive to air flow.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Bradford had what The Guardian called a [...] "burgeoning fringe scene" [...] which {{included}} theatre companies {{with names like}} the John Bull <b>Puncture</b> <b>Repair</b> Kit and The Welfare State. Edgar was co-founder of such a group that took the name The General Will Theatre Company which specialised in a [...] "crude and cartoonish" [...] style of political commentary presented with generous dollops of music hall and burlesque for comedic effect. General Will took several of Edgar's works on tour including The National Interest (1971), a series of sketches showing how the mythical concept of 'The National Interest' {{can be used to}} justify sacrifices by the many on behalf of the self-interested few; The Rupert Show (1971) a one-act play set in a church during a service conducted by among others a vicar who also plays Superman, Lord Longford and Judge Argyle, the judge in the Oz obscenity trial, which the title mocks, and State of Emergency (1972), which toured with General Will and also appeared at the Edinburgh Festival and at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, all in 1972, was a one-act documentary with songs about industrial resistance to the Conservative government. General Will came to a halt when the only gay member of the company took exception to the heterosexual slant of the material and went on strike in mid-performance. They did, however, lead to Edgar's first foreign premiere.|$|E

Poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) (EMMA), also known as Surlyn is an ionomer-based copolymer that undergoes puncture reversal (self-healing) following high impact puncture at high velocities. However EMMA is not a structural engineering polymer, and will not meet the demands of aerospace applications requiring self-healing engineering materials.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and demonstrate the advantages of a new technique for carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) with proximal cerebral protection through a direct transcervical approach, as compared with a percutaneous transfemoral approach. MethodsCAS procedures were carried out in 25 consecutive patients, 4 with the femoral approach and 21 through a 2 -cm incision at the base of the neck, with the patient under local anesthesia. For transcervical occlusion and protective shunting (TOPS), a short 9 F sheath was inserted directly into the common carotid artery and connected to a 6 F sheath placed percutaneously in the ipsilateral internal jugular vein. After clamping the common carotid artery proximal to the 9 F sheath, internal carotid artery blood flow reversal was confirmed or an occluding external carotid balloon was placed. A filter interposed between the arterial and venous sheaths collected embolic debris from transcarotid manipulations. The arterial <b>puncture</b> was directly <b>repaired</b> with suture. Neurologic status was assessed with the National Institutes of Health stroke scale by an independent neurology consultant before and after the procedure. ResultsOne of the four percutaneous femoral approaches that failed because of tortuous anatomy was successfully treated with TOPS. Angiographic confirmation demonstrating resolution of asymptomatic (> 80 %; n = 12) stenosis or symptomatic (> 60 %; n = 12) stenosis was achieved in all patients with stents. A 0 % technical failure rate and 0 % combined 30 -day stroke or mortality rate were achieved in all CAS attempted with TOPS. There were no hematomas in the cervical group, despite pretreatment with clopidogrel bisulfate and heparin, and one hematoma in the femoral group after failure of a Perclose arterial closure device. In one of the patients in the femoral group bilateral cholesterol emboli to the toes developed. ConclusionTOPS solves problems of access, embolization into the cerebral and peripheral circulation, and specialized cerebral protection devices, and enables secure closure of the access vessel in patients given anticoagulation therapy. TOPS may provide a safer, more effective, economical means for performing CAS...|$|R
