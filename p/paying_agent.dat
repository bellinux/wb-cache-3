2500|$|Tax Credits: Tax credits {{can remove}} {{a portion of}} the income tax owed to the state by the {{production}} company, but since most production companies are limited purpose business entities they often incur very little, if any tax liability. [...] The use of the word [...] "tax credit" [...] or [...] "tax rebate" [...] often results in public confusion, as they layperson may think the program is a refund of taxes paid by the production, when it is actually based on a significant percentage of the production's actual spend and the amount is awarded regardless of whether the entity pays taxes (which they generally do not) (as explained by Louisiana's Chief Legislative Economist: “It’s {{got nothing to do with}} tax...We’re just using the tax-filing process and the Department of Revenue as the <b>paying</b> <b>agent</b> for a spending program. That’s what we’re doing.”) [...] Production companies must often meet minimum spending requirements to be eligible for the credit. [...] Of the 28 states that offer tax credits, 26 make them either transferable or refundable. [...] Transferable credits allow production companies that generate tax credits greater than their tax liability to sell those credits to other taxpayers, who then use them to reduce or eliminate their own tax liability. Refundable credits are such that the state will pay the production company the balance in excess of the company's owed state tax.|$|E

Diane Urquhart, a financial analyst, testified before a parliamentary committee that $100 million is missing from the HWT and that a $37 million loan to the corporation has not been paid back. The HWT was an unregistered trust maintained by Nortel to provide medical, dental, life insurance, long-term disability and survivor income and pension transition benefits.Until 2005 Nortel fully funded the disability insurance in its HWT. However, it is alleged that since then, the HWT Governance Committees and third party trustee, Northern Trust, breached their fiduciary duties to protect Nortel's disabled employees and survivors of deceased employees by allowing Nortel to misdirect over $100 million from the HWT for purposes inconsistent with {{the terms of the}} HWT.As of March 1, 2012, Northern Trust continues to act as the <b>paying</b> <b>agent</b> for Canadian Nortel pensioners.|$|E

The FSC submits recommendations on the locality pay program to the President's <b>Pay</b> <b>Agent.</b> The FSC's recommendations cover the establishment or modification of pay localities, the coverage of salary surveys (conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) used to set locality pay, the process for making pay comparisons, and the level of comparability payments that should be made. The FSC's recommendations are advisory only and are not binding on the President.

50|$|CERP Officers had {{authority}} to sign agreements with contractors up to $200,000. The <b>Pay</b> <b>Agent</b> disbursed cash or paid by electronic transfer (EFT) in Afghanistan. The PRT Commander (LTC or CDR) could approve projects up to $25,000. CERP guidelines required that development projects be coordinated through and sustained by local governments and prohibit the use of funding for the salaries of government officials. The monies {{could not be used}} by police or security forces. CERP projects from up to $200,000 had to be approved by the Task Force Commander. The contracts were written in US Engineering standards. The Army usually paid by electronic funds transfer as <b>pay</b> <b>agents</b> are discouraged from paying cash to contractors in Afghanistan. The projects were paid in phases. Engineers worked through project details with contractors. If the contractors failed the performance work standard, the engineer could recommend that the PRT withhold funds until project deficiencies were corrected. The project could also be cancelled.|$|R

We provide simple and efficient algorithms to solve this problem and we show through an example how to solve the stated problem in practice...|$|R
40|$|This {{handbook}} {{addresses the}} roles and functions of Soldiers performing as field ordering officers (FOOs) and paying agents. The Army relies on contracts for equipment, supplies, and services. Most contracts are not million- or multi-million-dollar programs that receive multiple levels of review. Most procurements are small “micro-purchases ” units use to meet one-time, immediate needs. However, the basic standards of ethics and business practices for large programs also apply to micro-purchases. This handbook provides many basic standards {{and serves as a}} ready reference for FOOs and paying agents while they support their units ’ requirements. Key lessons: • FOOs and paying agents must work closely together, but they are not alone. They are part of an acquisition team that includes the contract and financial management experts who will provide the guidance and direction to each FOO and <b>paying</b> <b>agent</b> to meet the unit’s needs. • While performing as FOOs or paying agents, Soldiers work for and must respond to guidance from the chief of contracting who appointed them...|$|E

Materials and methodsProspective, descriptive and comparative study, made on disabled hospitalized people in 2 RC (Lebanese and French). A grid includes demographics, disabling conditions, characteristics related to hospitalization and problems found at the exit and the socio-professional reintegration. Information is collected on Microsoft Excel 2007 and information processing performed on SPSS Version 18 software. ResultsThirty patients, including 18 handicapped in Lebanon (L) and 12 in France (F). 60 % female, mean age 70 years [36 – 92]. Main pathology: AVC 33. 3 %, 43. 3 % fractures. Average Length of stay: F 169 days [SD= 272 days] against L: 39 [SD= 20 days]. (P value= 0. 4). Social coverage rate: F 100 % [SD= 0]; L 90 % [SD= 7 %]. (P value= 0. 01). The length of stay was limited by the <b>paying</b> <b>agent</b> for 8. 3 % in France 9. 4 %. Hospitalization shortened for budgetary reasons F 8. 3 %; L 33. 3 %.

The majority of patients were retired. 25 % had a job full time in France versus 11. 1 % in Lebanon. ConclusionDisabling conditions are comparable in Lebanon and France, as well as hospital care.

40|$|The {{contracts}} {{we consider}} {{in this paper}} must solve three problems: moral hazard, insurance and discrimination. The moral hazard problem is that of providing the agents with incentives to perform {{in a way that}} maximizes the profit to the principal, when the agent's actions are unobservable. The insurance problem is that of minimizing the cost of risk through risk minimization and risk sharing. The issue of discrimination is that of <b>paying</b> <b>agents</b> with different skills sufficiently to participate, without overcompensating other agents. We show how the principal may benefit from a strategic division of the agents into different tournaments or groups. The optimal number of groups from the principal's point of view is determined through a trade-off between moral hazard, insurance and discrimination issues. Agribusiness,...|$|R
