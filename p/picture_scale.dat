40|$|There is a {{huge amount}} of legacy COBOL-code still being used today, e. g. at bank {{computer}} systems. Manual maintenance of this code is too expensive. Therefore, it is desirable to automate all kinds of routine modications. An important requirement in such modications is the preservation of comments and the original layout of the program. CobolX is an environment for implementing transformations on COBOL programs. The environment is built using the Transformation Tools (XT) package, which provides tools for parsing (SDF/SGLR), transformation (Stratego) and pretty printing (GPP). Since COBOL is a complex language, it is necessary to generate all kinds of tools from the syntax denition, since hand coding would not be feasible. The XT package provides grammar tools for generating signatures and pretty-print tables from syntax denitions. These tools were adapted to support layout preservation. As a rst case study, the <b>picture</b> <b>scaling</b> transformation has been implemented. <b>Picture</b> <b>scaling</b> involves propagating information about the aected variables and then <b>scaling</b> <b>picture</b> declarations and constants. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} the child’s dental anxiety levels when in a dental clinic and also determine which of the three chosen scales can be used effectively to evaluate dental anxiety levels. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted among 100 children aged between 8 - 15 years were randomly selected on their first dental visit. The children were asked if they would participate in the study that would assess on how they emotionally feel about the dentist and the thought of getting a dental treatment. It was also ensured that it was the child’s first dental visit. Parent’s consent was also obtained for the same. The child’s anxiety level was assessed using three different scales; RMS- pictorial scale; Facial image scale; Venham <b>picture</b> <b>scale.</b> Results: The average score of RMS pictorial scale, Facial image scale, and Venom’s <b>picture</b> <b>scale</b> is 2. 71, 2. 12, 2. 65 respectively. On comparing the 3 scales, statistically significant results are obtained. This signifies that when the value of one scale increases there is also an increase {{in the value of the}} other two corresponding scales. Conclusion: In this study, significant results were obtained on comparison of the scales. Hence any of the three scales can be used as an aid to assess the child’s anxiety levels when in a dental clinic...|$|E

Weak gender differences were found in that the girls were slightly, but significantly, better calibrated than the boys. In addition, although both boys and girls overestimated the total number of memory questions they had answered correctly, the boys gave higher estimates compared with the girls. In brief, the results indicate that, at least in the context investigated, 11 - 12 year-old children's confidence in and estimations of their own event memory show poor realism (overconfidence and overestimation). A comparison with previous research on adults indicates that 11 to 12 -year-old children show noticeably poorer realism...|$|E

(1) critically evaluating two commercial software packages (the BioImage system and the Molecular Analyst Fingerprinting Plus system [MAFP]; Bio-Rad) in re-lation {{to their ability to}} compare discriminate populations of Listeria monocytogenes on the basis of electrophoretic data. We would like to comment on some aspects of the comparison of banding patterns from different gels and the critical relevance of the band-linking procedure. Since electrophoretic mobility of bands is scarcely reproduc-ible in different experiments, even with the highest degree of standardization (2), comparison of patterns from different runs can be performed either by transforming migration data into molecular weights (BioImage) or by varying the gel <b>picture</b> <b>scale</b> in order to align the bands of the same internal standard present in all gels (MAFP). In our opinion, the latter proce-dure involves linear variation of the lane dimensions, not nec-essarily proportional to the actual migration dynamics of each band in agarose gels.

40|$|OBJECTIVESTo {{describe}} {{the development of}} a facial expression tool differentiating pain-free cats from those in acute pain. METHODSObservers shown facial images from painful and pain-free cats were asked to identify if they were in pain or not. From facial images, anatomical landmarks were identified and distances between these were mapped. Selected distances underwent statistical analysis to identify features discriminating pain-free and painful cats. Additionally, thumbnail photographs were reviewed by two experts to identify discriminating facial features between the groups. RESULTSObservers (n[*]=[*] 68) had difficulty in identifying pain-free from painful cats, with only 13 % of observers being able to discriminate more than 80 % of painful cats. Analysis of 78 facial landmarks and 80 distances identified six significant factors differentiating pain-free and painful faces including ear position and areas around the mouth/muzzle. Standardised mouth and ear distances when combined showed excellent discrimination properties, correctly differentiating pain-free and painful cats in 98 % of cases. Expert review supported these findings and a cartoon-type <b>picture</b> <b>scale</b> was developed from thumbnail images.

40|$|Introduction: Dental {{treatment}} {{is usually a}} poignant phenomenon for children. Projective scales are preferred over psychometric scales to recognize it, and to obtain the self-report from children. Aims: The aims were to evaluate treatment related fear using a newly developed fear scale for children, fear assessment <b>picture</b> <b>scale</b> (FAPS), and anxiety with colored version of modified facial affective scale (MFAS) - three faces along with physiologic responses (pulse rate and oxygen saturation) obtained by pulse oximeter before and during pulpectomy procedure. Settings and Design: Total, 60 children of age 6 - 8 years who were visiting the dental hospital {{for the first time}} and needed pulpectomy treatment were selected. Children selected were of sound physical, physiological, and mental condition. Two projective scales were used; one to assess fear - FAPS and to assess anxiety - colored version of MFAS - three faces. These were co-related with the physiological responses (oxygen saturation and pulse rate) of children obtained by pulse oximeter before and during the pulpectomy procedure. Statistical Analysis Used: Shapiro-Wilk test, McNemar′s test, Wilcoxon signed ranks test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney test were applied in the study. Results: The physiological responses showed association with FAPS and MFAS though not significant. However, oxygen saturation with MFAS showed a significant change between "no anxiety" and "some anxiety" as quantified by Kruskal-Wallis test value 6. 287, P = 0. 043 (< 0. 05) before pulpectomy procedure. Conclusions: The FAPS can prove to be a pragmatic tool in spotting the fear among young children. This test is easy and fast to apply on children and reduces the chair-side time...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} realism in people's confidence judgments. Study I investigated whether mood influences the confidence {{people have in}} their event memory. However, {{there were no significant}} differences in the realism of the participants' confidence judgments between conditions (elated and neutral). This study concluded that moderate levels of elation might not influence the realism in confidence judgments. In Study II the stability and variability in the realism of confidence judgments over time, content domain and gender were investigated. Two tests, WORD (word knowledge) and DTK (logical/spatial ability), from the Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test were administered on three occasions. The results showed that there were stable individual differences over time and domain in the participants' confidence judgments. No gender differences were found and no effect was found of the cognitive style Need-for-Cognition, NfC. Study III investigated children's (11 - 12 year old) confidence judgments of answers to questions on their episodic memories. Four different confidence scales were tested; the numeric scale, the <b>picture</b> <b>scale,</b> the line scale and the written scale. The four scales showed no difference for the children's confidence judgments. Further, the children were more overconfident than adults who had used the same material in recent studies. Also, the children's frequency judgments showed overestimation. Finally, Study IV investigated how social feedback influence children's (12 year old) confidence judgments (the same material as in Study III was used). The between-subject factor related to whether the feedback was given by a teacher or a classmate and the within-subject factor concerned type of feedback; confirmatory or disconfirmatory feedback on both correct and incorrect answers. The results showed that the children were overconfident independent of what kind of feedback they recieved and no effect of the source of the feedback was found. However, confirmatory feedback resulted in worse realism in the children's confidence judgments than disconfirmatory feedback. The children's frequency judgments again showed overestimation. In summary, the results in this thesis show that individual differences and developmental aspects should be added to the five factors that were argued by Allwood and Granhag (1999) to influence confidence judgments; time, feedback, contextual, motivational and experience within the domain...|$|E

Methods: A retrospective review evaluated 35 patients (35 right eyes [OD], 34 left eyes [OS]) who remained on bimatoprost 0. 03 % and 30 patients (27 OD, 30 OS) who were switched to bimatoprost 0. 01 % during the period January 8, 2010 to December 26, 2012. Mean IOP was measured 6 and 3 months before the switch, at switch, and 3, 6, and 12 months after the switch. Hyperemia scores were recorded before and after the switch and were compared to a <b>picture</b> <b>scale.</b> Results: Mean IOP in the group that switched was 16. 96 ± 5. 03 mmHg in OD and 17. 67 ± 5. 33 mmHg in OS at baseline. Mean IOP postswitch to bimatoprost 0. 01 % solution was 17. 60 ± 4. 34 mmHg in OD and 17. 00 ± 3. 37 mmHg in OS. IOP was not significantly reduced in either OD or OS postswitch to bimatoprost 0. 01 % (P 1 = 0. 5 OD, P 2 = 0. 2 OS). The hyperemia scores improved remarkably when bimatoprost 0. 03 % solution was switched to bimatoprost 0. 01 % solution (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first switch study evaluating the hypotensive efficacy and tolerability of bimatoprost in a group of patients with open-angle glaucoma. In this study comparing bimatoprost 0. 03 % and 0. 01 % solution, we found improved tolerability postswitch to 0. 01 % from 0. 03 % bimatoprost, similar efficacy between the two concentrations before and after switch in the same patient population, and similar IOPs comparable to nonswitch bimatoprost 0. 03 % solution.

A descriptive design was used to answer research questions developed according to the Science of Unitary Human Beings theoretical framework: (1) what are the changes in patterning, as observed through the manifestation of optimism, power, and well-being over time, in women before beginning and upon completing a 6 -week prenatal yoga program during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and (2) does change in patterning, as observed through the manifestations of optimism, power, and well-being over time, differ for women beginning yoga classes in the third trimester from women who begin classes in the second trimester of pregnancy?  A convenience sample of 21 pregnant women was recruited from a public health prenatal clinic and a private nurse-midwifery practice in Wake County, North Carolina. The sample was delimited to women who volunteered to participate in the study and were (a) in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy between 20 to 32 weeks gestation; (b) 18 years old and above; (c) able to speak, read, and write in English; and (d) experiencing an uncomplicated, low-risk pregnancy.   To address the first research question, an analysis of patterning change, interpreted as change in scores over time from baseline to completion of a 6 -week prenatal program, was tested using a paired samples, two-tailed t-test of significance for the variables of optimism, as measured by the Life Orientation Test-Revised; power, as measured by the Power to Knowingly Participate in Change Tool Version II; and well-being, as measured by the Well-Being <b>Picture</b> <b>Scale</b> and the Short Form- 12 Version 2 Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary. The mean change in scores for optimism, power, and well-being in this study reflected a statistically significant increase from baseline to completion of the 6 -week prenatal yoga program. Regardless of the trimester in which women entered into the study, there was no statistically significant difference in gain scores for optimism, power, and well-being upon completion of the 6 -week yoga program.   The findings of this study support field pattern diversity among women who practiced yoga during late pregnancy and manifested over time as greater optimism, power, and well- being.

40|$|Abstract A {{longitudinal}} {{follow-up study}} of postnatal depression {{was performed in}} the years 1995 - 2000 in the University of Oulu. A volunteer, ramdomly selected group of 187 mothers from maternal wards of the University Hospital of Oulu were studied with different questionnaires in the first postpartum week. Depressive symptoms were re-assessed with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale four months postpartum when paternal depression was evaluated with Beck Depression Inventory. 16. 2 % {{of the women were}} immediately after delivery screened as being depressed. Four months postpartum 13. 0 % of the mothers were depressed whereas 5. 1 % of the fathers were having depressive symptoms. The cumulative incidence of maternal postnatal depression within the first four months was 22. 2 %. These mothers who immediately showed depressive symptoms were at a higher risk to be depressed later. Maternal age 30 years or less predicted postnatal depression. The occurrence of maternal postnatal depression varied slightly during different seasons; during dark time immediate depressive symptoms increased and the spring seemed to protect from later postnatal depression. Analgesia during vaginal delivery, e. g. nitrous oxide, epidural analgesia or paracervical blockade, protected from postnatal depression as well. Caesarean section, either elective or emergency, did not predict postpartum mental well-being. Scores from the GHQ and the EPDS were strongly interrelated. Seven (5 %) fathers were depressed four moths postpartum. They all were men whose partners also scored high in the EPDS. Those mothers who were depressed interpreted infant facial signals differently, seeing less joy, disgust and anger, but more sadness in the infant facial pictures. Cultural variability was found in complex blended facial features of emotions, e. g. distress, in the Infant Facial Expression from Looking at <b>Picture</b> <b>scale,</b> although remarkable agreement was achieved and reinforced. In the videotaped early mother-infant interaction small, but essential, changes were observed at 10 months postpartum. Overall, mothers who had had persistent depressive symptoms showed less negative expressions and had less anger and anxiety in their interaction. Their children were slightly less impulsive and seemed to have less visual and communicative contact with their mothers. The dyad was characterised by short periods of uninvolvement between the mother and the infant; e. g. the moments of reciprocity were less frequent than in the non-depressed mothers. At 42 months postpartum, the children of the persistently depressed mothers scored lower on the Expressive language scale than the children of the mothers who were depressed in one measurement or never...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to create a}} {{software}} tool to unwrap digital images of cylindrical rock cores and also to create a tool to measure the accuracy of the unwrapping transform. Measurements of an object can be taken directly from an image if the object is planar and the image plane of the camera is perpendicular to the object. If these conditions are met then <b>picture</b> <b>scale</b> allows a user to relate measurements in the image to a real world coordinate system after correcting for radial distortion. But if the object in the image is not planar or is not perpendicular to the image plane then additional corrections or geometric transformations must be applied to the object in the image. The project is focused on creating a coded software solution, using digital images from an off the shelf-camera, to transform or unwrap single images of cylindrical rock cores so that all objects in the image are co-planar. In addition to tools created to unwrap digital images a second software tool was created to verify the accuracy of the unwrapping software. The project is broken down into three major components. The first is a technique for taking pictures of rock core, or image acquisition. A single rock core is wrapped with a paper grid pattern that is used to determine a pixel scale for a series of images of a rock core sample. The grid wrapped core is placed in a carriage made of a set of two rollers. This carriage is then centered below a camera that is remotely controlled from a desktop computer. Two halogen lights are used to evenly illuminate the surface of the core and an image is taken. Once the grid pattern is photographed the pattern is removed and a series of images of the outer surface of the core are taken. The next phase of the unwrapping is to take the original image and pass it through a series of software modules that will assist the user to perform a rectification of the original images. First the scale of each pixel in the image is found using images of the original grid pattern wrapped around the core. Next the core itself is isolated from other background objects present in each image. Then a geometric transform is applied to the image of the core, using the unique pixel scale, with the goal to unwrap each image so that all objects in the image are co-planar and no longer suffer any distortion. In order to measure the effectiveness of this transform on rectifying all areas of the image, a second software tool was created. This software tool allows the user the ability to measure the spacing of gridlines in the original image of the grid wrapped core and compare these measurements to the same image after it has been unwrapped. The code returns a database of measurements for every gridline present in a image as well as different plots of the data for the user to make final conclusions as to the effectiveness of unwrapping on each area of the core images...|$|E
