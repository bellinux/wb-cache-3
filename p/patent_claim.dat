40|$|The Article {{proceeds}} as follows. Part I {{reviews the}} basics of <b>patent</b> <b>claiming,</b> the traditional view of claims as real property deeds, and why uncertainty as to the boundaries of those deeds is considered undesirable. Part II critiques the analogy between real property deeds and <b>patent</b> <b>claims,</b> highlighting in particular the requisite novelty and conceptual nature of the patent res, {{the differences between the}} purposes of the patent system and real property regimes, and the effect of these different purposes on the expected predictability of patent boundaries. Part III then changes the analogy from <b>patent</b> <b>claims</b> as property deeds to <b>patent</b> <b>claims</b> as rules of governance, noting the advantages and limitations of this analogy. The Article concludes with a discussion of <b>patent</b> <b>claims</b> not just as rules of governance but also as blends of rules and standards in their need to anticipate often unpredictable circumstances...|$|R
25|$|RDX was {{reported}} in 1898 by Georg Friedrich Henning, who obtained a German patent (patent No. 104280) for its manufacture by nitrolysis of hexamine (hexamethylenetetramine) with concentrated nitric acid. In this patent, the medical properties of RDX were mentioned; however, three further German patents obtained by Henning in 1916 proposed its use in smokeless propellants. The German military started investigating its use in 1920, referring to it as hexogen. Research and development findings were not published further until Edmund von Herz, described as an Austrian and later a German citizen, obtained a British patent in 1921 and a United States patent in 1922. Both patent claims were initiated in Austria; and described the manufacture of RDX by nitrating hexamethylenetetramine. The British patent claims included the manufacture of RDX by nitration, its use with or without other explosives, and its use as a bursting charge and as an initiator. The US <b>patent</b> <b>claim</b> was {{for the use of}} a hollow explosive device containing RDX and a detonator cap containing RDX. In the 1930s, Germany developed improved production methods.|$|E
500|$|In a {{citation}} graph the vertices are documents with {{a single}} publication date. The edges represent the citations from the bibliography of one document to other necessarily earlier documents. The classic example comes from the citations between academic papers as {{pointed out in the}} 1965 article [...] "Networks of Scientific Papers" [...] by Derek J. de Solla Price. [...] In this case the citation count of a paper is just the in-degree of the corresponding vertex of the citation network. This is an important measure in citation analysis. Court judgements provide another example as judges support their conclusions in one case by recalling other earlier decisions made in previous cases. A final example is provided by patents which must refer to earlier prior art, earlier patents which are relevant to the current <b>patent</b> <b>claim.</b> By taking the special properties of directed acyclic graphs into account, one can analyse these graphs with techniques not available when analysing the general graphs considered in many studies in network analysis. For instance transitive reduction gives a new insights into the citation distributions found in different applications highlighting clear differences in the mechanisms creating citations networks in different contexts. Another technique is main path analysis, which traces the citation links and suggests the most significant citation chains in a given citation graph.|$|E

50|$|Moreover, the <b>patent</b> <b>claims</b> {{licensed}} to the manufacturers (the P1 of the diagram above) are not infringed by {{the conduct of}} the content providers accused of infringement. Their conduct infringes the P2 <b>patent</b> <b>claims</b> that were not {{licensed to}} the manufacturers. The only sale in the case was by the licensed smartphone manufacturers to the consumer end users, and that sale exhausted only the P1 claims. The Federal Circuit said exhaustion cannot occur as to unrelated <b>patent</b> <b>claims.</b> The court added that the content providers had not shown that the licensed P1 claims embodied substantially the same invention as the P2 <b>patent</b> <b>claims</b> under which the content providers were sued, so that the doctrine of the Univis and Quanta cases did not apply to expand the scope of the exhaustion.|$|R
2500|$|The {{law which}} is {{applicable}} {{to this case}} is section 101 of the Patent Act. If Flook's <b>patent</b> <b>claim</b> can meet {{the definition of a}} [...] "process" [...] under that law then it is patent-eligible (that is, {{it is the kind of}} thing that can receive a patent if it is also novel, unobvious, and the like). The Court decided that the <b>patent</b> <b>claim</b> under review was instead a claim to a [...] "principle" [...] or a [...] "law of nature" [...] and thus not patent-eligible. The Court relied on a line of cases following from the Neilson blast furnace case. The principle of that case, as explained in O’Reilly v. Morse, is that that patent-eligibility must be analyzed on the basis of it being as if the principle, algorithm, or mathematical formula were already well known (was in the prior art). Flook's process is thus ineligible for a patent [...] "because, once that algorithm is assumed to be within the prior art, the application, considered as a whole, contains no patentable invention."

2500|$|During the [...] "spark era" [...] {{the radio}} {{engineering}} profession gave credit to Tesla; his circuit {{became known as}} the [...] "Tesla coil" [...] or [...] "Tesla transformer". However Tesla did not benefit financially, due to competing patent claims. Marconi had claimed rights to the [...] "closed primary open secondary" [...] transmitter circuit in his controversial 1900 [...] "four circuit" [...] wireless patent. Tesla sued Marconi in 1915 for patent infringement, but didn't have the resources to pursue the action. However, in 1943, in a separate suit brought by the Marconi Company against the US government for use of its patents in World War I, the US Supreme Court invalidated Marconi's 1900 <b>patent</b> <b>claim</b> to the [...] "four circuit" [...] concept. The ruling cited the prior patents of Tesla, Lodge, and Stone, but did not decide which of these parties had rights to the circuit. By that time the issue was moot; the patent had expired in 1915 and spark transmitters had long been obsolete.|$|E

2500|$|On {{deciphering}} {{the patent}} legalese, it becomes apparent that Toulmin did not patent the airplane. [...] Rather, Toulmin patented airplane (flying-machine) wing edges (lateral marginal portions) that normally are flat but may {{move up and}} down in a direction that is different from the airplane's line of flight and may be moved to different angles. [...] Although the patent particularly addressed a solid wing with a portion of the wing (the marginal portions) being flexed (warped) to provide lift, the <b>patent</b> <b>claim</b> was not so limiting. [...] In particular, Toulmin's genius as a patent attorney predicated and helped the Wright Brothers patent slats, the spoiler, the aileron, the flaps, the elevator, and the Rudder for an airplane (see picture above). [...] Without these, an airplane cannot be controlled any more than a car can be controlled without movable wheels. [...] Without a license to the Wright brothers' patent, it was not legally possible to build or fly a controllable airplane in the early 20th century. [...] Unsurprisingly, the verbal and legal attacks by competitors on the Wright Brothers began almost immediately.|$|E

40|$|In the post-Markman era, the Federal Circuit {{has focused}} {{attention}} on the public notice function of <b>patent</b> <b>claims</b> in equivalents cases, and {{it has come to}} emphasize precision and accuracy in claim drafting. This Article argues that recent judicial emphasis on the public notice function of <b>patent</b> <b>claims</b> is an inappropriate innovation policy. The demand for highly refined <b>patent</b> <b>claims</b> increases <b>patent</b> acquisition expenditures that are unlikely to increase social welfare, cause patent rights to be distributed unevenly, and are inconsistent with the structural features of the patent system. This Article presents two mechanisms to accommodate the doctrine of equivalents in the post-Markman era. One is the reinvigoration of the reissue proceeding. The other is allowing judicial amendment of <b>patent</b> <b>claims</b> during infringement litigation proceedings, much like the longstanding British practice. This shift would allow courts to pursue the policy goals of Markman for literal and equivalent infringement alike...|$|R
