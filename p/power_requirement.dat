Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created.

40|$|Approaches to {{satisfying}} the <b>power</b> <b>requirements</b> of space-based Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) missions are studied. The <b>power</b> <b>requirements</b> for non-SDI military space missions and for civil space missions of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are also considered. The more demanding SDI <b>power</b> <b>requirements</b> appear to encompass many, if not all, of the <b>power</b> <b>requirements</b> for those missions. Study {{results indicate that}} practical fulfillment of SDI requirements will necessitate substantial advances {{in the state of}} the art of power technology. SDI goals include the capability to operate space-based beam weapons, sometimes referred to as directed-energy weapons. Such weapons pose unprecedented <b>power</b> <b>requirements,</b> both during preparation for battle and during battle conditions. The power regimes for these two sets of applications are referred to as alert mode and burst mode, respectively. Alert-mode <b>power</b> <b>requirements</b> are presently stated to range from about 100 kW to a few megawatts for cumulative durations of about a year or more. Burst-mode <b>power</b> <b>requirements</b> are roughly estimated to range from tens to hundreds of megawatts for durations of a few hundred to a few thousand seconds. There are two likely energy sources, chemical and nuclear, for powering SDI directed-energy weapons during the alert and burst modes. The choice between chemical and nuclear space power systems depends in large part on the total duration during which power must be provided. Complete study findings, conclusions, and eight recommendations are reported...|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} its {{operation}} in 1956, ENIAC contained 20,000 vacuum tubes, 7200 crystal diodes, 1500 relays, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors and approximately 5,000,000 hand-soldered joints. It weighed more than 30 short tons (27 t), was roughly 2.4m × 0.9m × 30m (8 × 3 × 100 feet) in size, occupied 167m2 (1,800ft2) and consumed 150 kW of electricity. This <b>power</b> <b>requirement</b> led to the rumor that whenever the computer was switched on, lights in Philadelphia dimmed. Input was possible from an IBM card reader and an IBM card punch was used for output. These cards could be used to produce printed output offline using an IBM accounting machine, such as the IBM 405. While ENIAC had no system to store memory in its inception, these punch cards could be used for external memory storage. In 1953, a 100-word magnetic-core memory built by the Burroughs Corporation was added to ENIAC.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the biggest}} change to the {{previous}} Finnish ice class rules {{was the way the}} structural requirements were determined. Instead of percentages and experience the minimum requirements were based on plastic deformation theory and pressure loads determined from observations of past ice damages in the Baltic Sea. The ships were divided into three areas (bow, midship, aft) and the pressure loads were calculated for each area {{as a function of the}} ship's displacement and engine output. The rules regarding rudders, engines and the propulsion system were also changed accordingly, and the propulsion system was to be designed so that its strength increased towards the engine. This minimized the repair costs as the parts most likely to break, the propeller blades, were also the easiest and cheapest to replace. Furthermore, a minimum <b>power</b> <b>requirement</b> was given so that the ice-strengthened ships would be powerful enough to follow the icebreakers and not slow down the traffic.|$|E

With the existing terminals handling 90 lakh, the airport {{will be able to}} handle 2.3 crore passengers per annum after the integration with 1.6 crore in domestic and 70 lakh in the international terminal. After expansion, the aircraft movements in the airport is likely to increase at the rate of 5 to 7%. By 2020–21, the airport is expected to handle 700 movements a day. The new terminals are expected to clock between 72 and 75 green points of the total 100 for integrated inhabited assessment. The AAI has divided the building for land-side and air-side operations. The spaces are connected with a central security checkpoint for departure and there is a glass bridge {{on each side of the}} building for arriving passengers. On the roadside, the new terminals are connected with an elevated corridor, which will have approach and exit ramps. The <b>power</b> <b>requirement</b> at the expanded airport is around 110 kV•A– more than three times the current needs. A new 11,000 kV sub-station has been built by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) at the airport to serve the terminals, for which the power has been sourced from Kadapperi near Tambaram.
