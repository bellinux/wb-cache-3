40|$|The {{properties}} {{of a new}} type of oligomycin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line (Olir 2. 2) are described in this paper. Olir 2. 2 cells were approximately 50, 000 -fold more resistant to oligomycin than were wild-type CHO cells when tested in glucose-containing medium, but only 10 - to 100 -fold more resistant when tested in galactose-containing medium. Olir 2. 2 cells grew with a doubling time similar to that of wild-type cells both in {{the presence or absence of}} oligomycin. Oligomycin resistance in Olir 2. 2 cells was stable in the absence of drug. In vitro assays indicated that there was approximately a 25 -fold increase in the resistance of the mitochondrial ATPase to inhibition by oligomycin in Olir 2. 2 cells, with little change in the total ATPase activity. The electron transport chain was shown to be functional in Olir 2. 2 cells. Olir 2. 2 cells were cross-resistant to other inhibitors of the mitochondrial ATPase (such as rutamycin, ossamycin, <b>peliomycin,</b> venturicidin, leucinostatin, and efrapeptin) and to other inhibitors of mitochondrial functions (such as chloramphenicol, rotenone, and antimycin). Oligomycin resistance was expressed codominantly in hybrids between Olir 2. 2 cells and wild-type cells. Cross-resistance to ossamycin, <b>peliomycin,</b> chloramphenicol, antimycin, venturicidin, leucinostatin, and efrapeptin was also expressed codominantly in hybrids. Fusions of enucleated Olir 2. 2 cells with wild-type cells and characterization of the resulting cybrid clones indicated that resistance to oligomycin and ossamycin results from a mutation in both a nuclear gene and a cytoplasmic gene. Cross-resistance to efrapeptin, leucinostatin, venturicidin, and antimycin results from a mutation in only a nuclear gene...|$|E
