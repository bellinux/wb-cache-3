5000|$|A <b>pink</b> <b>peppercorn</b> (French: baie rose, [...] "pink berry") is a dried berry of the shrub Schinus molle, {{commonly}} known as the Peruvian peppertree.|$|E
50|$|Although a peppercorn is {{the dried}} fruit {{of a plant}} from the genus Piper, <b>pink</b> <b>peppercorns</b> {{came to be called}} such because they {{resemble}} peppercorns, and because they, too, have a peppery flavour. As they are members of the cashew family, they may cause allergic reactions including anaphylaxis for persons with a tree nut allergy.|$|R
5000|$|Dried berries {{from the}} related species Schinus terebinthifolius (the Brazilian pepper), are {{sometimes}} also called <b>pink</b> <b>peppercorns</b> (baies roses de Bourbon). The dried berries of that shrub are employed as culinary spice. The Brazilian pepper {{was brought to}} Florida in 1598 as an ornamental plant and eventually became invasive {{in the area where}} it {{is often referred to as}} [...] "Florida Holly".|$|R
50|$|Schinus is a genus of {{flowering}} trees and tall shrubs in the sumac family, Anacardiaceae. Members {{of the genus}} {{are commonly known as}} pepper trees. The Peruvian pepper tree (Schinus molle) {{is the source of the}} spice known as <b>pink</b> <b>peppercorns.</b> They can become serious invasive species outside their natural habitats. Schinus polygama, although less well known, is also potentially weedy in some areas.|$|R
5000|$|Rihanna {{described}} the fragrance as being [...] "for all women for every mood". The top {{notes of the}} fragrance include lemon blossom, cyclamen, bergamot and <b>pink</b> <b>peppercorn.</b> The middle notes consist of Jasmine, rose, muget, plum and suede while the base notes are sandalwood, patchouli, golden amber and vanilla.|$|E
5000|$|... "Pink peppercorns" [...] are {{the fruits}} of a plant from a {{different}} family, the Peruvian pepper tree, Schinus molle, or its relative the Brazilian pepper tree, Schinus terebinthifolius. A <b>pink</b> <b>peppercorn</b> (French: baie rose, [...] "pink berry") is a dried berry of the shrub Schinus molle, {{commonly known as the}} Peruvian peppertree. As they are members of the cashew family, they may cause allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, for persons with a tree nut allergy.|$|E
5000|$|In 1982, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{banned the}} import of Brazilian peppercorns from France into the United States, asserting that people who eat the berries risk an array of acute symptoms, such as swollen eyelids and indigestion, similar to poison ivy. In response, the Government of France {{maintained}} that the berries are safe to eat if grown in prescribed conditions. The United States later lifted the ban. Presently <b>pink</b> <b>peppercorn</b> lacks [...] "generally recognized as safe" [...] (GRAS) status with the FDA.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{not related}} to {{commercial}} pepper (Piper nigrum) the pink/red berries are sold as <b>pink</b> <b>peppercorns</b> and often blended with commercial pepper. The fruit and leaves are, however, potentially poisonous to poultry, pigs and possibly calves. Records also exist of young children who have experienced vomiting and diarrhea after eating the fruit. Presently Schinus molle lacks {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) status with the FDA.|$|R
50|$|Although {{it is not}} a true pepper (Piper), its dried drupes {{are often}} sold as <b>pink</b> <b>peppercorns,</b> as are the fruits from the related species Schinus molle (Peruvian peppertree). The seeds {{can be used as a}} spice, adding a pepper-like taste to food. They are usually sold in a dry state and have a bright pink color. They are less often sold pickled in brine, where they have a dull, almost green hue.|$|R
50|$|Peppercorn {{sauce is}} a culinary cream sauce {{prepared}} with peppercorn, which is prepared as {{a reduction of}} the cream in the cooking process. Various types of peppercorn {{can be used in}} its preparation, such as black, green and <b>pink,</b> among others. <b>Peppercorn</b> sauce may be served with beef steak such as filet mignon and other beef tenderloin cuts, lamb, rack of lamb, chicken and fish dishes, such as those prepared with tuna and salmon.Some versions use several types of peppercorns in the sauce's preparation, and some may use ingredients that are similar in flavor to but not classified as peppercorns, such as sansho. Peppercorn sauce may be used on dishes served at French bistros and restaurants. Some versions of steak au poivre use a peppercorn sauce in their preparation.|$|R
50|$|The species, {{including}} the seed, is legally prohibited from sale, transport, or planting in Florida, {{according to the}} Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Noxious Weed List. It is classified as a Category I pest by The Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council (FL EPPC). To keep the plant from spreading into native plant communities and displacing them, local regulations and environmental guidelines require eradication of Brazilian pepper wherever possible. The plant and all parts are also illegal for sale or transfer in Texas. As {{one of the two}} species sold as <b>pink</b> <b>peppercorn,</b> the other being Schinus molle, it lacks generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status with the FDA.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} a single {{documented}} case of pink peppercorns (often used in four-blend peppers) causing an allergic reaction in those with nut allergies. <b>Pink</b> <b>peppercorn</b> is not a true pepper, but dried roasted berries derived from Schinus terebinthifolius, a flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae, native to South America. Common names include Brazilian Pepper, Rose Pepper and Christmasberry. Pink peppercorns are used as a spice to add a mild pepper-like taste to foods. It may potentially cause an irritating skin effect and {{has been a}}ssociated with atopic dermatitis in canines. Interestingly, S. terebinthifolius {{is a member of the}} family Anacardiaceae, which include plants in the genera Anacardium (cashew) and Pistacia (pistachio). No allergens from this plant have been characterized but there is potential for cross-reactivity among different members of the Anacardiaceae family.|$|E
40|$|Pink peppercorns {{are among}} the most {{sophisticated}} condiments in the international cuisine. This culinary spice is obtained from dried fruits of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi, a species native to South America. In this work, a methodology for the assessment of <b>pink</b> <b>peppercorn</b> quality under various drying conditions was defined. Experiments were performed in a pilot tray dryer, which ensured integrity of the product. A central composite rotatable design with 11 experiments was devised to study the influence of drying air temperature (35 – 75 °C) and air velocity (0. 3 – 0. 9 [*]m/s) on product quality, assessed by moisture content, color (CIELAB system), and volatile compounds. The essential oils of fresh and dried fruits were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Air temperature had the greatest influence on the quality parameters under study, while air velocity had no statistically significant effect. Considering all quality criteria, temperatures between 40 and 55 °C provided the best compromise, yielding an adequate moisture content in the dried product without dramatic degradation of color and essential oil...|$|E
