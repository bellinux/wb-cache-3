5|$|Space Travel is {{an early}} video game {{developed}} by Ken Thompson in 1969 that simulates travel in the solar system. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> astronomical bodies.|$|E
5|$|The more matter {{there is}} in the Universe, the {{stronger}} the mutual gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter. If the Universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the Universe contained too little matter then the expansion would accelerate too rapidly for planets and planetary systems to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our universe has just the right mass density of about 5 protons per cubic meter which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.|$|E
5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play. Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned for the end of 2011. To finance a tour of the play, Burnt Thicket Theatre raised money through fundraisers, which included the 2011 Calgary Ride for Refuge.|$|E
50|$|Hair {{texturing}} {{techniques are}} also {{relevant to the}} style and follows traditional Povoan techniques, most notably <b>the</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hair called puxo.|$|R
25|$|There are a {{great number}} of special casts meant to evade {{problems}} like trees behind the angler (roll cast), <b>the</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line on the fly by <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream, or to make the fly land more softly.|$|R
50|$|A claw hand {{can result}} <b>of</b> {{injuries}} to <b>the</b> inferior brachial plexus (C8 - T1). The condition {{may arise from}} the limb being suddenly pulled upward. For example, Klumpke paralysis can occur from excessive <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infant's forelimb during parturition.|$|R
5|$|Some {{mainframe}} {{games that}} did not appear in 101 BASIC Computer Games have still had a lasting impact. One such game was Space Travel, developed by Ken Thompson in 1969, which simulates travel in the Solar System. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model {{of the solar system}} with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> astronomical bodies. The game was developed at Bell Labs, and was ported during 1969 from the Multics operating system to the GECOS operating system on the GE 635 computer, and then to the PDP-7 minicomputer. While porting the game to the PDP-7, Thompson developed ideas for his own operating system, which later formed the core of the Unix operating system. Space Travel never spread beyond Bell Labs or had an effect on future games, leaving its primary legacy as part of the original push for the development of Unix.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the ship date back to 4 March 2005, in a {{proposal}} drafted by then-Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs (which is now a nonexistent entity), Björn Bjarnason, regarding {{the purchase of a}} new vessel, in order to replace the aging ICGV Óðinn, and aircraft for the Icelandic Coast Guard. The Althing decided that this was an exigent matter, and so a high priority was placed upon the proposal. A needs analysis pertaining to the acquisition of a multi-purpose vessel and aircraft for the ICG was initiated on 31 September 2005. The main demands were that the vessel should be designed for rescue work and patrolling, pollution prevention, fuelling search and rescue helicopters in flight, and meeting civil defence requirements anywhere around the country. In addition, it was to be equipped for response to, and prevention of, terrorist threats and be suitable for operations involving the police or customs authorities, and for all types of rescue and salvage work. The bollard <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessel was to take account of the greatly increased volume of passenger and cargo shipping in Iceland’s economic zone and coastal waters.|$|E

50|$|Alexis Vila {{was due to}} take on John Dodson, but <b>pulled</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{bout with}} an unknown injury. Dodson was to fight Shooto veteran Mamoru Yamaguchi. However, on April 18, Dodson <b>pulled</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bout due to {{undisclosed}} reasons and Yamaguchi instead fought John Dunsmoor.|$|R

50|$|Dodson was {{expected}} to fight at Tachi Palace Fights 9 against Alexis Vila. However, Vila suffered an injury {{and was forced to}} <b>pull</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bout. Vila was replaced by former Shooto champion Mamoru Yamaguchi. Dodson then <b>pulled</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fight for unknown reasons, and was replaced by Kevin Dunsmoor.|$|R
25|$|Detached {{binaries}} are {{binary stars}} where each component is within its Roche lobe, i.e. {{the area where}} the gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star itself is larger than that of the other component. The stars have no major effect on each other, and essentially evolve separately. Most binaries belong to this class.|$|E
25|$|Semi-automatic {{actions are}} similar in {{principle}} to machine gun actions, but only allow one shot per <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trigger. These actions provide the fastest operation, usually allowing a shot to be fired {{as fast as the}} shooter can pull the trigger. Since the action requires the energy created by the cartridge to operate the cyclic, there is less felt recoil, however, they may fail to cycle under extreme conditions.|$|E
25|$|For this transfer, the {{posterior}} {{part of the}} deltoid muscle is released from its origin and attached to the triceps muscle (usually {{by means of a}} tendon graft or a synthetic graft) leaving the rest of the deltoid muscle intact. This transfer is usually very successful because the line of <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> posterior deltoid muscle is {{in the same direction as}} the triceps muscle. Also, there is hardly any loss of function.|$|E
500|$|Next was Matt Striker versus Balls Mahoney in a [...] "Striker's Rules" [...] match, a {{match with}} [...] "no gouging <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eyes, no <b>pulling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hair, no {{maneuvers}} {{off the top}} rope and, most importantly, no foul language". Mahoney won the match after he performed a spinebuster and pinned Striker for the victory.|$|R

50|$|His next Bellator bout was {{scheduled}} against Ralph Kelly at Bellator 20. Kelly <b>pulled</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bout {{and was replaced}} by Wayne Cole. Cole then <b>pulled</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fight {{and was replaced by}} Marcus Sursa. Sanchez won via TKO in the third round. With this win, Eddie will take a spot in the third season heavyweight tournament.|$|R
25|$|Currently, Tasers are {{programmed}} to be activated in automatic five second bursts, although the officer {{can stop the}} energy charge at any time by engaging the safety switch. The charge can also be prolonged beyond five seconds if the trigger is held down continuously. The operator can also inflict repeated shock cycles with each <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trigger as long as both barbs remain attached to the subject. The only technical limit to the number or length of the electrical cycles is {{the life of the}} battery, which can be ten minutes or more.|$|E
25|$|On the subducting side of {{the island}} arc is a deep and narrow oceanic trench, which is the trace at the Earth’s surface of the {{boundary}} between the downgoing and overriding plates. This trench is created by the gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relatively dense subducting plate pulling {{the leading edge of the}} plate downward. Multiple earthquakes occur along this subduction boundary with the seismic hypocenters located at increasing depth under the island arc: these quakes define the Wadati–Benioff zones. The volcanic arc forms when the subducting plate reaches a depth of about 100km.|$|E
25|$|Progressive presses handle several shells at once, {{with each}} <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lever {{performing}} {{a single step}} on all the cases at once. Progressive presses hold all the dies needed, plus a powder measure and a primer feed, and often also include an additional station where the powder levels are checked, to prevent over or under charges. Progressive presses also often feature case feeds that will hold hundreds of cases to be loaded, and all the user {{has to do is}} hold the bullet in place over the appropriate case mouth, and pull the lever.|$|E
25|$|Lashley {{has signed}} a three-year deal with Shark Fights and was {{expected}} to make his debut against Darrill Schoonover in November, The fight was {{to be for the}} heavyweight title. However Schoonover later <b>pulled</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bout due to an injury. Lashley was then set to headline Shark Fights 21 against Tim Hague. But Hague <b>pulled</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bout for unknown reasons and was replaced by Dave Huckaba. On November 7 it was confirmed that the fight with Huckaba had been scrapped for unknown reasons, Lashley was then scheduled to face Mark Martinez but Martinez was later <b>pulled</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bout due to expired blood work.|$|R
50|$|Chas Skelly was {{expected}} to fight Georgi Karakhanyan in a fourth season featherweight tournament qualifier bout. However, Skelly injured himself during training {{and was forced to}} <b>pull</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bout. Skelly's replacement was to be UFC veteran, Alvin Robinson. However, Robinson was also forced to <b>pull</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bout due to injury. Robinson was replaced by WEC veteran Anthony Leone.|$|R
50|$|Also {{in season}} 2, Jacob was <b>pulled</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{competition}} due to family problems.|$|R
25|$|The {{rotator cuff}} is an {{anatomical}} term {{given to the}} group of four muscles and their tendons that act to stabilize the shoulder. These muscles are the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis and that hold the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity during movement. The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches {{to the head of the}} humerus. Together, these keep the humeral head in the glenoid cavity, preventing upward migration of the humeral head caused by the <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deltoid muscle at the beginning of arm elevation. The infraspinatus and the teres minor, along with the anterior fibers of the deltoid muscle, are responsible for external rotation of the arm.|$|E
25|$|An open-bolt {{mechanism}} {{is a common}} characteristic of fully automatic firearms. With this system, pulling the trigger releases the bolt from a cocked, rearward position, pushing a cartridge from the magazine into the chamber, firing the gun. The bolt retracts to the rearward position, ready to strip the next cartridge from the magazine. The open-bolt system is often used in submachine guns and other weapons with {{a high rate of}} fire. It is rarely used in semi-automatic-only firearms, which can fire only one shot with each <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trigger. The closed-bolt system is generally more accurate, as the centre of gravity changes relatively little at the moment the trigger is pulled.|$|E
25|$|With {{the other}} members of her family preoccupied, Miriam's {{obsession}} takes a new turn when she finds herself entering people's houses and stealing small objects from them. Several times she is almost discovered, but, though she tries to anchor herself to the real world through emotionally detached sex with Saul, she cannot resist the <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empty houses. At the National Spelling Bee, Eliza performs well but does not win, so she begins to prepare for the following year, with Saul's enthusiastic help. But the family is about to be torn apart. Miriam is arrested, pleads {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, and is admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Aaron announces his intention to leave home, and his faith, to join ISKCON.|$|E
25|$|Tsonga <b>pulled</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Open {{because of}} a knee problem that lasted for several months. This knee injury made him <b>pull</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quarterfinals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Davis Cup, France vs. the United States. He {{underwent}} successful knee surgery and participated in the 2008 US Open. He defeated Santiago Ventura and Carlos Moyà, before falling to world no. 5 Tommy Robredo in the third round.|$|R

25|$|At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge {{from one}} another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tectonic plates, the release of {{pressure}} leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are {{at the bottom of}} the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} very proud of his work in {{producing}} the first artificial meteors. He placed explosive charges in the nose cone of a V2 rocket, to be detonated at high altitude and fire high velocity pellets of metal through the atmosphere. The first attempts appeared to be failures, and Zwicky sought to try again with the Aerobee rocket. His requests were denied, until the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1. Twelve days later, on October 16, 1957, Zwicky launched his experiment on the Aerobee, and successfully fired pellets visible from the Mount Palomar observatory. It is thought {{that one of these}} pellets may have escaped the gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth and become the first object launched into a solar orbit.|$|E
25|$|In the {{cable-stayed}} bridge, {{the towers}} {{are the primary}} load-bearing structures which transmit the bridge loads to the ground. A cantilever approach {{is often used to}} support the bridge deck near the towers, but lengths further from them are supported by cables running directly to the towers. This has the disadvantage, compared to the suspension bridge, that the cables pull to the sides as opposed to directly up, requiring the bridge deck to be stronger to resist the resulting horizontal compression loads; but has the advantage of not requiring firm anchorages to resist the horizontal <b>pull</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main cables of the suspension bridge. By design all static horizontal forces of the cable-stayed bridge are balanced so that the supporting towers do not tend to tilt or slide, needing only to resist horizontal forces from the live loads.|$|E
