2500|$|There is no all-encompassing fire code in the United States.

2500|$|On 27 March 2007 a {{cryogenic}} magnet support {{designed and}} provided by Fermilab and KEK broke during an initial pressure test involving {{one of the}} LHC's inner triplet (focusing quadrupole) magnet assemblies. No one was injured. Fermilab director Pier Oddone stated [...] "In this case we are dumbfounded that we missed some very simple balance of forces". This fault had been present in the original design, and remained during four engineering reviews over the following years. Analysis revealed that its design, made as thin as possible for better insulation, was {{not strong enough to}} withstand the forces generated during <b>pressure</b> <b>testing.</b> Details are available in a statement from Fermilab, with which CERN is in agreement. Repairing the broken magnet and reinforcing the eight identical assemblies used by LHC delayed the startup date, then planned for November 2007.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} phase of testing, called <b>Pressure</b> <b>Testing,</b> {{candidates}} who have successfully performed the Valsalva maneuver will be subjected to increased ambient pressure. [...] This test is performed under the supervision of a diving-certified medical doctor. [...] All testees enter a pressure chamber, accompanied by the doctor, and the 'tank' is sealed. [...] Typically, there is in the chamber a somewhat surprising object: an inflated volleyball, water polo ball or similar inflated ball. [...] Upon sealing the tank, pressure is increased, while the testees equalise their eardrum pressure. [...] (if any testee is unable to 'Valsalva', the test stops, and pressure is slowly released.) [...] Pressure builds within the chamber until the chamber is equal to water pressure at [...] "escape depth". [...] At this point, the chamber feels very warm and dry, and the volleyball has become compressed enough that it has become the shape of a bowl, and appears to have been emptied of air, due to the greatly increased air pressure inside of the tank. [...] Sounds inside the tank at pressure sound as if they are [...] "far away".|$|E
2500|$|A full {{investigation}} was launched into the accident by several government agencies, {{as well as}} legal representatives {{for the families of}} the deceased. The investigation determined that the leak was initially discovered by employees of the contractor J.M. Brennan Inc., who helped maintain plumbing, heating, air conditioning and ventilation equipment at the plant. These four employees noticed propane gas pooling as Falk employees started the propane system, which the factory uses as a backup fuel supply when natural gas is shut down during peak demand. These employees alerted other workers to the problem. There had been testing conducted on the system for a full 40minutes prior to the explosion. It is also thought the leak came from an underground pipe that ran from propane tanks to the propane/air mixers, which convert the liquid propane into gaseous form, so that it is in a form usable by the boilers. This is backed up by the discovery of a small pocket of gas trapped below asphalt directly below the Annex building. <b>Pressure</b> <b>testing</b> of the pipe using nitrogen has since confirmed it was leaking. Subsequent excavation showed it had two separate leaks; [...] Metallurgists have examined the damaged sections of pipeline and determined that the pipe corroded. Falk's evacuation procedure will also feature prominently in the investigation.|$|E
