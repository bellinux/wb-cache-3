40|$|Abstract:- Video {{compression}} {{is vital}} for efficient storage and transmission of digital video signal. The hybrid video coding techniques based on predicative and transform coding are adopted by many video-coding standards such as ISO MPEG- 1 / 2 and ITU-T H. 261 / 262 / 263, owing to its high compression efficiency. Motion compensation is a predictive technique for exploiting the temporal redundancy between successive frames of video sequence. Block matching is a simple and effective motion estimation method to obtain the motion compensation prediction. In panorama camera motion, we can enhance the bit rate and minimize the encoding time by calculating the largest block This minimizes the number of motion vectors required for <b>P</b> <b>picture</b> coding which improves the bit rate by average ratio 1 : 975, which is the ratio between the largest block and the equivalent blocks in the standard MPE...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} fast close-loop video {{transcoder}} with limited drifting error. Firstly, {{similar to the}} traditional close-loop transcoder, the proposed transcoder still accumulates the re-quantization errors of each I or <b>P</b> <b>picture.</b> However, the accumulated errors are not always introduced into the transcoding loop in every block. A triple-threshold algorithm is proposed to adaptively utilize the accumulated errors at block level so as to control drifting error under an acceptable level. Secondly, when the accumulated errors are not introduced into the transcoding loop, additional DCT transform in the proposed transcoder can be removed. Furthermore, the requantization process can be simply implemented by looking up table, which significantly reduces {{the complexity of the}} re-quantization process. The experimental results show that picture quality of the proposed transcoder is closed to that of the traditional closed-loop one while about 40 % blocks are not updated with the accumulated errors. In this case, the transcoding process can be speeded up to 30 %. 1...|$|E
40|$|In the H. 264 /MPEG- 4 AVC video coding standard, motion {{compensation}} {{can be performed}} by partitioning macroblocks into square or rectangular regions to improve inter prediction efficiency. However, current H. 264 MB partition set is not optimal because the rigid square or rectangular divisions can’t match the boundary shape of a moving object well. In this paper, we analyze this problem in detail and propose an object-boundary-based motion partition scheme to overcome the problem. The proposed scheme generates the motion partition map for current macroblock by segmenting corresponding area in the reference picture. Due to continuity of the object boundary shape in the video sequence, this technique allows {{the shapes of the}} partition map to match better the boundaries of moving objects.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient smoothing scheme for the real-time transmission of MPEG 1 transcoded video over `best-effort' IP networks. The scheme uses intelligent partitioning and multiplexing of the packetised bitstream. Bit-rate smoothing {{is achieved by}} partitioning packets according to their picture type (I, P or B). Subsequently, the partitioned packets are multiplexed {{in such a way}} that each packet from an anchor (I and <b>P)</b> <b>picture</b> is followed by two packets from B-pictures. The proposed scheme smoothes the bit rate of the encoded video, making it more suitable for adaptive video streaming applications. In such applications, the transmission bit rate is varied so as to adapt to the available network bandwidth. The scheme re-organises the transmission order of the packets, spreading the less important packets from the B-pictures into the more important packets from the anchor pictures. This has the effect of reducing the likelihood # A preliminary version of this paper was presented at IEE International Conference on Visual Information Engineering, VIE 2003 of losing the more important anchor packets, thereby improving the quality of transmitted video...|$|E

During bingo, two sets of repertoires were evaluated, depending on the participant”s choice to be a player or the caller. If a participant chose to be the caller, target responses included drawing {{a piece of paper}} contained in a non-transparent bag, and then either (a) reading the printed word and warning the players if it was picture (e.g., “cavalo [horse], figura [picture]) or (b) reading the printed word (e.g., cavalo [horse]). If participants chose to be players, responses involved placing a bean on top of the (a) picture called or (b) word read by the caller. All participants had to play in each role at least once, so if they had already been a caller in a match, the experimenter requested that they became a player in the next match. In domino matches, target responses included placing the piece with the corresponding picture or printed word by the picture or printed word that was at either extremity of the game laid out on the table. The target conditional relations in this game were handwritten word (HW) - handwritten word (HW), handwritten word (HW) - printed word (PW), handwritten word (HW) - picture (P), printed word (PW)- printed word (PW), printed word (PW) - handwritten word (HW), printed word (PW) - picture (<b>P),</b> <b>picture</b> (P) - handwritten word (HW), picture (P) - printed word (PW), and picture (P) - picture (P).

40|$|Immersive {{virtual reality}} {{techniques}} present {{new opportunities for}} research into consumer behavior. The current study examines whether the increased realism of a virtual store compared to pictorial (2 D) stimuli elicits consumer behavior that is {{more in line with}} behavior in a physical store. We examine the number, variety, and type of products selected, amount of money spent, and responses to price promotions and shelf display, in three product categories (fruit & vegetables, milk, and biscuits). We find that virtual reality elicits behavior that is more similar to behavior in the physical store compared to the picture condition for the number of products selected (Milk: M store = 1. 19, M virtual = 1. 53, M pictures = 2. 58) and amount of money spent (Milk: M store = 1. 27, M virtual = 1. 53, M pictures = 2. 60 Euro), and for the selection of products from different areas of the shelf, both vertically (purchases from top shelves, milk and biscuits: P store = 21. 6 %, P virtual = 33. 4 %, <b>P</b> <b>pictures</b> = 50. 0 %) and horizontally (purchase from left shelf, biscuits: P store = 35. 5 %, P virtual = 53. 3 %, <b>P</b> <b>pictures</b> = 66. 7 %). This indicates that virtual reality can improve realism in responses to shelf allocation. Virtual reality was not able to diminish other differences between lab and physical store: participants bought more products and spent more money (for biscuits and fruit & vegetables), bought more national brands, and responded more strongly to price promotions in both virtual reality and pictorial representations than in the physical store. Implications for the use of virtual reality in studies of consumer food choice behavior as well as for future improvement of virtual reality techniques are discussed. </p...|$|R

30|$|Scalability {{is one of}} the {{essential}} requirements in the compression of visual data for present-day multimedia communications and storage. The basic building block for providing the spatial scalability in the scalable video coding (SVC) standard is the well-known Laplacian pyramid (LP). An LP achieves the multiscale representation of the video as a base-layer signal at lower resolution together with several enhancement-layer signals at successive higher resolutions. In this paper, we propose to improve the coding performance of the enhancement layers through efficient interlayer decorrelation techniques. We first show that, with nonbiorthogonal upsampling and downsampling filters, the base layer and the enhancement layers are correlated. We investigate two structures to reduce this correlation. The first structure updates the base-layer signal by subtracting from it the low-frequency component of the enhancement layer signal. The second structure modifies the prediction in order that the low-frequency component in the new enhancement layer is diminished. The second structure is integrated in the JSVM 4.0 codec with suitable modifications in the prediction modes. Experimental results with some standard test sequences demonstrate coding gains up to 1 dB for I pictures and up to 0.7 dB for both I and <b>P</b> <b>pictures.</b>|$|R
