5|$|Lynch {{collaborated with}} most of the cast and crew of Eraserhead again on later films. Frederick Elmes served as cinematographer on Blue Velvet, 1988's The Cowboy and the Frenchman, and 1990's Wild at Heart. Alan Splet {{provided}} sound design for The Elephant Man, Dune, and Blue Velvet. Jack Fisk directed episodes of Lynch's 1992 television series On the Air and worked as a production designer on 1999's The Straight Story and 2001's Mulholland Drive. Coulson and Nance appeared in Twin <b>Peaks,</b> <b>and</b> made further appearances in Dune, Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, and 1997's Lost Highway.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 7th Marines {{opened the}} road between Hagaru-ri and Koto-ri by {{capturing}} {{the high ground}} surrounding the road. But {{as soon as the}} Marines pulled out, the 77th Division returned to the <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> attacked the column. Chaotic fighting broke out within the column and the retreat was slowed to a crawl. The Marine night fighters, however, returned to subdue the Chinese forces, and the fighting destroyed most of the blocking troops. On 7 December, the rest of the column managed to reach Koto-ri with little difficulty with the last elements arrived at Koto-ri that night.|$|E

40|$|The mudded weak {{interlayer}} is a geotechnical sandwich material exhibiting {{strain softening}} behavior, which {{plays an important}} part in the slope stability. The present work primarily focuses on the shear strength of the mudded weak interlayer in rock slopes. To determine the <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> residual shear strengths of the mudded weak interlayers, the particle flow code (PFC) is used to simulate the failure behavior during the direct shear tests. Laboratory investigations including uniaxial compression test, SEM, and 3 D deformation measurement are employed to calibrate the essential micro parameters of the mudded weak interlayer during the simulation process in PFC. The numerical model is built based on these parameters <b>and</b> both the <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> residual shear strengths can be predicted from the model. The prediction results show that the <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> residual internal friction angle are 19. 36 ° and 14. 61 °, while the <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> residual cohesion are 22. 33 [*]kPa and 2. 73 [*]kPa, respectively. Moreover, to validate the obtained <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> residual strengths, the results are compared with literature data. The <b>peak</b> <b>and</b> residual shear strengths of the mudded weak interlayer can serve as an important benchmark to evaluate the stability of side slopes and provide guiding suggestions for their reinforcement...|$|R
5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
5|$|The module's plot {{revolves}} around {{the tomb of the}} demilich Acererak. The player characters must battle their way past a variety of monsters and traps, with the ultimate goal of destroying Acererak. Tomb of Horrors was considered the third greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by the staff of Dragon in 2004. The module has influenced later Dungeons & Dragons products, and was followed by three other (unrelated) modules in the S-series: S2 White Plume Mountain, S3 Expedition to the Barrier <b>Peaks,</b> <b>and</b> S4 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity {{or other forms of}} grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand <b>peaks,</b> <b>and</b> allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.|$|E

5|$|Ariel {{appears to}} be fairly evenly cratered {{compared}} to other moons of Uranus; the relative paucity of large craters suggests that its surface does not date to the Solar System's formation, which means that Ariel must have been completely resurfaced at some point of its history. Ariel's past geologic activity {{is believed to have}} been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently. The largest crater observed on Ariel, Yangoor, is only 78km across, and shows signs of subsequent deformation. All large craters on Ariel have flat floors and central <b>peaks,</b> <b>and</b> few of the craters are surrounded by bright ejecta deposits. Many craters are polygonal, indicating that their appearance was influenced by the preexisting crustal structure. In the cratered plains there are a few large (about 100km in diameter) light patches that may be degraded impact craters. If this is the case they would be similar to palimpsests on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. It has been suggested that a circular depression 245km in diameter located at 10°S 30°E is a large, highly degraded impact structure.|$|E
5|$|During the American {{assault on}} Attu Island, 2,400 Japanese troops were killed, and only 25 were captured. The Americans' losses were {{significantly}} lower, at 566 dead and 1,442 wounded. The {{bodies of the}} killed Japanese troops were buried in mass graves on the island – only five per cent of Japanese troops fighting on Attu Island wore dog tags, making identification difficult. In addition, many fallen Japanese were buried by their fellow soldiers up in the island's <b>peaks,</b> <b>and</b> many bodies still remain undiscovered. The American burials were undertaken at Massacre Bay {{as well as at}} Holtz Bay – in the former case, the bodies of the soldiers were buried in group graves. Large holes of seven feet in depth were dug by bulldozers, and eight small foot-deep graves were dug at the bottom of each of these holes to serve as the American soldiers' final resting places.|$|E
5|$|Many of Titan's craters or {{probable}} craters display {{evidence of}} extensive erosion, and all show {{some indication of}} modification. Most large craters have breached or incomplete rims, {{despite the fact that}} some craters on Titan have relatively more massive rims than those anywhere else in the Solar System. There is little evidence of formation of palimpsests through viscoelastic crustal relaxation, unlike on other large icy moons. Most craters lack central <b>peaks</b> <b>and</b> have smooth floors, possibly due to impact-generation or later eruption of cryovolcanic lava. Infill from various geological processes is one reason for Titan's relative deficiency of craters; atmospheric shielding also plays a role. It is estimated that Titan's atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface by a factor of two.|$|E
