5000|$|... eIF3 {{serves as}} a hub for {{cellular}} signaling through S6K1 and mTOR/Raptor. In particular, eIF3 is bound by S6K1 in its inactive state, and activated mTOR/Raptor binds <b>to</b> eIF3 and <b>phosphorylates</b> S6K1 <b>to</b> promote its release from eIF3. Phosphorylated S6K1 is then free <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> a number of its own targets, including eIF4B, thus serving as a mechanism of translational control.|$|R

50|$|The {{absence of}} fructokinase {{results in the}} {{inability}} <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> fructose <b>to</b> fructose-1-phosphate within the cell. As a result, fructose is neither trapped within the cell nor directed toward its metabolism. Free fructose concentrations in the liver increase and fructose is free to leave the cell and enter plasma.

CREB plays {{a central}} role in ethanol responses making its activation an important step in the pathway.

40|$|Abstract: Extracellular-signal {{regulated}} kinase (ERK) signaling {{is required}} for a multitude of physiological and patho-physiological processes. However, {{the identities of the}} proteins that ERK <b>phosphorylates</b> <b>to</b> elicit these responses are incompletely known. Using an affinity purification methodology of general utility, here we identify cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain 2 (DYNC 1 I- 2, IC- 2) as a novel substrate for ERK following epidermal growth factor receptor stimulation of fibroblasts. IC- 2 is a subunit of cytoplasmic dynein, a minus-end directed motor protein necessary for transport of diverse cargos along microtubules.

50|$|Phosphorylation {{can result}} when the hormones {{glucagon}} or epinephrine bind to cell surface receptors, {{but the main}} cause of phosphorylation is due to a rise in AMP levels when the energy status of the cell is low, leading to the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is the main kinase regulator of ACC, able <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> a number of serine residues on both isoforms of ACC. On ACC1, AMPK phosphorylates Ser79, Ser1200, and Ser1215. Protein kinase A also has the ability <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> ACC, with a much greater ability <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> ACC2 than ACC1. However, the physiological significance of protein kinase A in the regulation of ACC is currently unknown.

40|$|Acyclovir, a {{nucleoside}} analog, {{is thought}} to be specific for the human herpesviruses because it requires a virally encoded enzyme <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> it <b>to</b> acyclovir monophosphate. Recently, acyclovir triphosphate was shown to be a direct inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) reverse transcriptase. Here, we showed that acyclovir is an inhibitor of HIV- 1 replication in CD 4 + T cells from cord blood that have undetectable levels of the eight human herpesviruses. Additionally, acyclovir phosphates were detected by reverse-phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and quantified in a primer extension assay from cord blood.

40|$|Bacteria possess protein serine/threonine and {{tyrosine}} kinases which resemble eukaryal kinases {{in their}} capacity <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> multiple substrates. We {{hypothesized that the}} analogy might extend further, and bacterial kinases may also undergo mutual phosphorylation and activation, which is currently considered as a hallmark of eukaryal kinase networks. In order to test this hypothesis, we explored the capacity of all members of four different classes of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases present in the firmicute model organism Bacillus subtilis <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> each other in vitro and {{interact with each other}} in vivo. The interactomics data suggested a high degree of connectivity among all types of kinases, while phosphorylation assays revealed equally wide-spread cross-phosphorylation events. Our findings suggest that the Hanks-type kinases PrkC, PrkD and YabT exhibit the highest capacity <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> other B. subtilis kinases, while the BY-kinase PtkA and the two-component-like kinases RsbW and SpoIIAB show the highest propensity to be phosphorylated by other kinases. Analysis of phosphorylated residues on several selected recipient kinases suggests that most cross-phosphorylation events concern key regulatory residues. Therefore, cross-phosphorylation events are very likely to influence the capacity of recipient kinases <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> substrates downstream in the signal transduction cascade. We therefore conclude that bacterial serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases probably engage in a network-type behavior previously described only in eukaryal cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of phosphatidyl[2 - 3 H]inositol ([3 H]PI) from vesicles or microsomal membranes into rat liver nuclei is greatly stimulated by phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PI-TP). The nuclei are able <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> [3 H]PI, {{with the production}} of phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate (PIP). Recovery of tritiated inositol trisphosphate, inositol phosphate, glycerophosphoinositol and inositol, suggests that in isolated nuclei a large set of enzymes of the PI cycle is present, similar to the enzymes involved in the plasma membrane PI cycle. Incubation with [gamma- 32 P]ATP shows that isolated nuclei are able <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> endogenous PI <b>to</b> PIP and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2).

50|$|Research has {{demonstrated}} that overexpression of CRBP-I increases the ability of RBP-ROH complex <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> STRA6 and, later, JAK2 and STAT5. Suppressing CRBP-I, on the other hand, led to decreased ability of RBP-ROH complex <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> STRA6 and signaling components. Similarly, reducing the expression of LRAT also decreased the ability of RBP-ROH complex <b>to</b> <b>phosphorylate</b> JAK2 and STAT5. Therefore, both CRBP-I and LRAT are necessary for the STRA6 signaling cascade upon the binding and transport of retinol. Interestingly enough, JAK2 is also conversely responsible for the activation of STRA6, after which apo-CRBP-I is recruited to the intercellular CBL of STRA6 and vitamin A might be transferred by the receptor to CRBP-I. Thus, both STRA6 signaling and STRA6 transport of vitamin A are dependent upon each other. Uptake of retinol is required for STRA6 signaling and JAK2 activation of STRA6 is necessary for retinol uptake.|$|R
