40|$|Background: Human enteroviruses (HEVs) {{can cause}} severe infections, {{especially}} {{in patients with}} a deficient humoral immune response, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia.

Treatment options consist of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), with various outcomes. <b>Pleconaril</b> is an antiviral agent with in vitro activity against HEVs {{that has been used}} in the treatment of HEV infections. Methods: The efficacy of <b>pleconaril</b> and IVIG against HEV isolated from the patients was assessed in vitro in two patients with CEMA. Results: Echovirus 11 was found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of case 1. Treatment with high-dose IVIG and <b>pleconaril</b> did not provide any clinical improvement and HEV PCR in CSF remained positive. Case 2 (echovirus 13 positive in CSF) was also treated with IVIG and <b>pleconaril.</b> The patient recovered completely and HEV PCR in CSF became negative.

40|$|Abstract Background Neuraminidase (NA) is a {{prominent}} surface antigen of Influenza viruses, which helps in release of viruses from the host cells after replication. Anti influenza {{drugs such as}} Oseltamivir target a highly conserved active site of NA, which comprises of 8 functional residues (R 118, D 151, R 152, R 224, E 276, R 292, R 371 and Y 406) to restrict viral release from host cells, thus inhibiting its ability to cleave sialic acid residues on the cell membrane. Reports on the emergence of Oseltamivir resistant strains of H 1 N 1 Influenza virus necessitated a search for alternative drug candidates. <b>Pleconaril</b> is a novel antiviral drug being developed by Schering-Plough to treat Picornaviridae infections, and is in its late clinical trials stage.

40|$|<b>Pleconaril</b> is a capsid {{inhibitor}} used previously {{to treat}} enterovirus infections. A pleconaril-resistant echovirus 11 (E 11) strain was identified before <b>pleconaril</b> treatment {{was given in}} an immunocompromised patient.

The pleconaril-resistant strains could not be neutralized in vitro, confirming IVIg treatment failure. To identify the basis of <b>pleconaril</b> resistance, genetic and structural analyses were conducted. Analysis of a modelled viral capsid indicated conformational changes in the hydrophobic pocket that could prevent <b>pleconaril</b> docking. Substitutions (V 117 I, V 119 M and I 188 L) in the pleconaril-resistant viruses were found in the pocket region of VP 1.

Although <b>pleconaril</b> resistance induced in vitro in a susceptible E 11 clinical isolate was characterized by a different substitution (I 183 M), resistance was suggested to also result from a similar mechanism, i. e. due to a protruding sulfate side chain of methionine.

Regardless of randomization group, patients with a baseline headache score of 5 or greater resolved headache 50 % more slowly than patients with a baseline headache score of 4. No differences in either clinical or laboratory adverse events were noted. Over 50 % of untreated patients had a persistent headache that was greater than 1 week in duration. <b>Pleconaril</b> shortened the course of illness compared to placebo recipients, especially in the early disease course. However, the benefit was achieved only modestly in a subgroup analysis of patients with more severe disease after adjusting for confounding variables...|$|E
40|$|Link to journal homepage: [URL] {{different}} antiviral assays {{were developed}} for the in vitro screening of inhibitors of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) of which (i) a cytopathic effect reduction assay suitable for medium-to-high-throughput screening and (ii) two virus yield reduction assays (based on quantification of viral RNA) for genotypes IB and IIIA. The assays were validated for antiviral studies with interferon-alpha (IFNÎ±) and amantadine HCl, two known inhibitors of HAV replication. IFNÎ± effectively inhibited HAV replication, whereas the activity of amantadine HCl appeared to be strain-dependent. Employing these assays, we assessed {{the effect of the}} known enterovirus inhibitors <b>pleconaril,</b> rupintrivir and enviroxime on HAV replication. <b>Pleconaril</b> exhibited some very moderate activity, the effect of rupintrivir proved to be strain-dependent. Enviroxime did not inhibit HAV replication, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol- 4 -kinase IIIÎ² is not crucial in the HAV life cycle. status: publishe...|$|E
