5|$|A {{number of}} feeder canyons {{running into the}} Black Canyon slope in the wrong {{direction}} for water to flow into the canyon. It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to a change in the tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard <b>Precambrian</b> <b>rock</b> of the Black Canyon and could not change its course.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{runs through}} {{an area with}} complex and varied geology. It runs through two rock complexes, the Halsnøy Basement Rock on the Sveio side, and Hardangerfjord Cover Complex on the Stord side. Both were created during the {{creation}} of the Caledonian orogeny 500 million years ago. The Halsnøy Basement Rock consists of <b>Precambrian</b> <b>rock</b> with elements of gneiss of both sedimentary and magmatic origin. They range between granite gneiss to mylonite. In the area between the two complexes, there is some amount of gabbro. At the lowest point, the tunnel runs through a section of phyllite, which continues to be the dominant species until the tunnel reaches Otterøya. Below the island the tunnel reaches a section of greenstone, before it rises again through more phyllite.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible {{for the quality of}} Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older <b>Precambrian</b> <b>rock.</b> When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|E

25|$|The {{bedrock of}} the Misquah Hills is a granophyre within the Duluth Complex, a {{relatively}} recent addition to the larger <b>Precambrian</b> <b>rock</b> formations of the Canadian Shield. This complex was formed during the Midcontinent Rift event. The rock type of the Misquah Hills ranges from granite to quartz monzonite to monzodiorite. These rocks date to 1106.0±5.1 Ma, placing them {{in the middle of}} the Stenian period of the Mesoproterozoic era. The Misquahs are geological cousins of the Adirondacks and the Laurentian Mountains of Quebec; they bear some visual resemblance to these ranges, though on a smaller scale.|$|E

He planned to study journalism, but became discouraged after a poor grade in a large lecture class. He was intrigued by an introductory geology class, and changed his major. His first geologic project was {{a study of the}} <b>Precambrian</b> <b>rock</b> that forms Michigan's Upper Peninsula. There he investigated the remains of an ancient volcano: a suite of metamorphosed basalts, a gabbroic sill, and volcanic roots {{in the form of a}} dioritic and gabbroic intrusion. The experience planted the seed of Johnston's passion for volcanoes. After working hard to learn the subject, he graduated with [...] "Highest Honors and Distinction" [...] in 1971.|$|E
2500|$|Ontario, {{owing to}} its size, has diverse geology that varies in structure, age, and lithology. About 61% of the {{province}} is covered by the Canadian Shield, mostly with <b>Precambrian</b> <b>rock.</b> These rocks contain large mineral deposits that are vital to the economy of northern Ontario. The shield can further be divided into three sections. The northwestern parts of the Shield, located roughly north and west of Sudbury, are known as the Superior Province; [...] {{this is the largest}} of the three sections, covering about 70% of the Shield portion in Ontario. This region is more than 2.5 billion years old and is composed of felsic intrusive rocks. In the northernmost parts of the Superior Province, the geology of the region is dominated by granite and gneiss rocks. The central region of the Shield, known as the Grenville Province and located south of Sudbury, is 1.0 to 1.6 billion years old and is dominated by sedimentary rocks showing evidence of being subjected to metamorphism. It makes up about 20% of the Canadian Shield in Ontario. These rocks were metamorphosed between 990 million years ago and 1.08 billion years ago. The third region, known as the Southern province which is a narrow region from Sault Ste. Marie to Kirkland Lake, is made of rocks dating 1.8 to 2.4 billion years ago. [...] The Hudson Bay lowlands, located north of the Canadian Shield, are mainly made of sedimentary rocks from the Silurian Period, although some parts date from the Ordovician and Devonian periods. This area covers 25% {{of the province}}. Most of the bedrock in the Hudson Bay lowlands is composed of limestone and carbonate-dominated sedimentary rock.|$|E

It mainly consists of <b>Precambrian</b> <b>rocks,</b> but also includes other crystalline rocks and minerals, which {{were collected from}} all over the world. In order to provide a quick reference to localities of interest, an overview of the most important geographical locations is given. During his life and particularly after his retirement, Schürmann spent much of his time studying the Precambrian in North Africa. As a result, he gathered an extensive and well-documented collection of <b>Precambrian</b> <b>rocks</b> and minerals from Egypt and an irreplaceable collection of <b>Precambrian</b> <b>rocks</b> from drill-cores of deep wells situated in Libya. Both collections are discussed in this paper. Subsequently, the collection of xenolith-bearing basalts from Finkenberg, Germany, and collections of glaucophane-bearing rocks, ophiolites and ores from various countries are highlighted.
