500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim. James Poniewozik of Time Magazine wrote, [...] "While it may {{not have}} been the high point that the emotional [...] "Peter" [...] from earlier this year was, [...] "Entrada" [...] was a pretty excellent action-focused episode, in which the dimensional swap between Fauxlivia and Realivia came to a head. In the process, it demonstrated that Fringes writers have made a compelling world out of Over There in a relative few episodes—and it was another example of what a strong series Fringe has become since its committed fully to its clash-of-the-universes storyline...All in all, a satisfying hour and a good demonstration of how Fringe—one of the most improved shows of the <b>past</b> <b>season</b> or so—has grown into one of TV's most entertaining dramas".|$|E
500|$|The Purple warrior ( [...] or [...] ) is {{a trophy}} {{awarded to the}} most {{distinguished}} player in the past year.

Between 2007 and 2011 the voting was conducted during the summer and awarded to the best player of the <b>past</b> <b>season,</b> however, the trophy for the season 2011–12 was not awarded. Instead, the club had decided to prolong the voting and award the trophy to the most distinguished player of the past full year (from January until December).

But it was funny to see Messing and Sean Hayes break from their scripts to giggle." [...] Cinquemani commented that Baldwin's [...] "absurd" [...] role as Malcolm [...] "is proving to be one of Will & Graces most enduring guest stars." [...] David Blum of The New York Sun reported that the producers of Will & Grace wasted Baldwin's [...] "prodigious talents on a supporting role this <b>past</b> <b>season,</b> when it's clear he could effortlessly carry his own network series." [...] Kauffman concluded that Grace's joke about George Bush being brain dead [...] "just falls amazingly flat".|$|E

Despite being the season premiere, [...] "Redux" [...] was the second episode produced of the season due to David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson being needed for filming on The X-Files movie. In [...] "Redux II", the role of [...] "Quiet Willy" [...] was originally intended for the character the [...] "Gray-Haired Man", but was re-written for a new character when actor Morris Panych was unavailable.

500|$|Trumble was {{selected}} in the Australian team to tour England in 1896, despite a poor domestic season in 1895–96 that saw {{his place in the}} touring squad seriously questioned by pundits. The leading cricket journalist, Tom Horan said that as much as he personally liked Trumble, he could not see him {{as a member of a}} team for the England tour that season. It was, however, during this tour that Trumble finally established a permanent place in the Australian line up. Wisden said of Trumble when listing him as one of its Cricketers of the Year, [...] "...it was not until his third visit, during the <b>past</b> <b>season,</b> that Trumble convinced Englishmen he was entitled to rank among the great bowlers of Australia". In that season, Trumble took 148wickets at an average of 15.81. He was seen as Australia's leading bowler who [...] "was able to inspire [...] batsmen with a feeling of apprehension". [...] Wisden's summary of the 1896 Australian tour said of Trumble, [...] "His great strength lay in the combination of spin with extreme accuracy" [...] and [...] "he was on all wickets distinctly the best bowler on the [...] side".|$|E

Grey's Anatomy doesn't need McDreamy. So even if the writers do decide to create a new love interest for Ms. Grey (Martin Henderson, perhaps?), it wouldn't matter. I have faith that the show's writers will do this storyline justice, because TV needs more strong single women — and Meredith seems like the perfect candidate." [...] The site added, [...] "This <b>past</b> <b>season</b> was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey's Anatomy. When Derek left for Washington D.C. to pursue his research, Meredith stayed behind and focused on her own career. She didn't chase him. Her priority were her children and the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Meredith showed that she would never put aside her own dreams and aspirations for a man, and I believe that this won't change after Derek's death." ...|$|E

[...] In December, pressure to fire Maulbetsch grew, and one Oklahoma newspaper observed: [...] "Coach Maulbetsch of the A. & M. football team is the object of attacks from many sides because of the rather poor showing made by his team during the <b>past</b> <b>season.</b> [...] They are looking for a goat and just now Johnnie is cast in that role. [...] Regardless of his past record, those who demand victory at any price and by any means whatsoever, are insisting that he be fired forthwith and a man be placed in the position who, by fair means or foul, will gather in a team that will win victories and never lose a game."

Sepinwall did not like Tracy and Kenneth's story, calling it a complete miss, but was appreciative of the other storylines, choosing Pete and Jenna's as his favorite. Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times was positive about Damon's role on the show, noting that he has been a [...] "hoot". Scott Eidler of The Cornell Daily Sun commented that the episode was a [...] "nice start to the [...] season" [...] of 30 Rock as it was [...] "perhaps more plot-driven than packed with the emotional and uproariously funny episodes that concluded last season." [...] Eidler commented that [...] "The Fabian Strategy" [...] never did [...] " [...] the utter hilariousness of last season, but I hope that wasn't the climax... and it can eventually return to its previous heights of hilarity".
