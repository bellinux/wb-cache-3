5000|$|In 1973, the Ano Karyes Association [...] "Lykaios Dias" [...] {{established}} the modern Lykaia, which are held {{every four years}} on the same place as the ancient games. The motto of these games is [...] "Stefanites and not Chrimatites" [...] (Greek: [...] "Στεφανίτες" [...] και όχι [...] "Χρηματίτες"), meaning {{that the purpose of}} these games is solely the moral perfection of man and not rewarding the winners with pecuniary means. Modern Lykaia are usually held in the beginning of August. The games begin with the lighting of the flame on the Arcadian's sacred peak. The Estiades of Mount Lykaion, making their appearance from the north, bring the Arcadian's eternal flame. The first Estiada walks slowly towards the southern <b>pillar</b> <b>base</b> (where two golden eagles were placed in ancient times) and lights the torch. The head priestess recites the Lycean Ode by Pindarus and then gives the torch to an athlete named as torch-bearer. The torch-bearer then runs into the stadium and lights the altar which is placed there. The closing ceremony includes cultural events, the lowering of the flag and the playing of the Greece's national anthem. The winner of each athletic event is awarded with an olive branch, a cup, a tripod, a medal or a diploma. All the athletes who participated-regardless of their performance-receive a certificate of participation, thus justifying the Games' motto. The last Lykaia were held from the 29th of July to the 7th of August 2005. The next games took place in the summer of 2009.Τhe next games will take place from 27th of July to the 4th of August 2013.On the last day(4th of August) the athletic events of track and field will take place at the mountain stadium.|$|E

40|$|Considerations {{regarding}} {{the structure of}} the CAP after 2013 are well underway. A key issue in this respect is the future of decoupled direct payments (DDP) in the first pillar, which represent the bulk of support for EU agriculture. The ‘Options Paper’ of the EU Commission indicates that first pillar payments in diversified form will remain part of the CAP after 2013. The size of the future budget is still uncertain, yet the level of the decoupled base premium is expected to be significantly lower. In this case the “progressive” co-financing mechanism being developed in this paper, which builds on the economic performance of member states, could provide an option for first pillar payments.

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{describes a}} {{design of experiments}} investigation of the deep reactive of pillar structures on a silicon wafer. The etched wafers would subsequently be used as masters for the fabrication of nickel mould inserts for microinjection moulding. Undercuts occur when the <b>pillar</b> <b>base</b> has a smaller cross-section than {{the apex of the}} pillar. They therefore affect tolerances of the subsequent nickel mould, its strength and its de-mouldability from the silicon form. The response measured in these experiments was the degree of undercut of micro-scale (10 μm x 10 μm x 40 μm, 5 μm x 5 μm x 40 μm and 2 μm x 2 μm x 40 μm) The literature suggests that gas pressure, platen power, gas flow rate, phase switching times and mask size can all affect the degree of undercut. After examination of this literature, and of manufacturers guidelines, three parameters were selected for experimental testing: platen power, C 4 F 8 gas flow rate during the passivation phase and switching times. Switching times was found to be the only statistically significant parameter for both 10 x 10 μm and 5 x 5 μm pillars. The 2 x 2 μm pillars were not successfully replicated and could therefore not undergo statistical evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Pillars or {{column is}} one of various types of {{standing}} upright, load-bearing architectural members. In history, when man has sought to enclose area, supports {{have been a major}} part in buildings, from huts to eminent monuments. Already before historic times it was known that such supports were less likely to fall in bad weather if they were inserted into flat stones and that, if the gaps were left at the top, they would give more stability for the roof. That’s why, the <b>pillar</b> <b>base</b> was presented and the improvement of the capital prefigured. Pillar is an equipment or a thing in civil, architectural and structural engineering which is used to transmit load from one part of the structure {{to another part of the}} structure. It is a compression member used for this purpose and keep the building straight. In architecture, "pillar" is a part of structure which also have a decorative and structural properties. A pillar may also be an element for decoration not support and structural purposes; many pillars are "engaged", i. e. they make apart of the structure wall. Design of any product require research and study of the things related to particular product. It is research on most types of pillar existed in history of Indian or Western culture and architecture. Study of different types of order present in western architecture and Parts and nomenclature of pillars are here. This research analyzed the columns or pillars as a vital part or element in architecture, aesthetic design and interior design of building, monuments and structures. In present time also pillars are an integrated part of our design, art and architecture in people life. The research include the evolution, development and alteration done on pillars time to time by various groups. CAD models is to be generated using CATIA keeping all the attributes and factors in mind and CAD model is then further be used for rapid prototyping and a prototype of the structure having all the pillars under one roof is generated using 3 D printing method. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the use of a design of {{experiment}} approach to examine the significance of process factors and interactions on the fabrication of micro- textured surfaces. The micro-textured surfaces examined contain pillar and hole features ranging from 80 – 2 micrometers in diameter. The processes examined are the deep reactive ion etching of silicon wafers for the production of silicon mould inserts and the micro-injection moulding of polypropylene, high density polyethylene and 316 LS stainless steel replicate samples of the silicon mould insert. During the deep reactive ion etching of the silicon wafers the design of experiment approach was used to determine the significant of platen power, C 4 F 8 gas flow and switching times to the presence of pillar undercut of 10 x 10, 5 x 5 and 2 x 2 micrometer pillars. Undercuts occur when the <b>pillar</b> <b>base</b> has a smaller cross-section than the apex of the pillar. Switching times was found to be the only statistically significant parameter for both 10 x 10 and 5 x 5 micrometer pillars. The design of experiment approach is used in the micro-injection moulding of polypropylene, high density polyethylene and 316 LS stainless steel replicates to examine the significance of mould temperature, cooling time, holding pressure and injection speed on the part and buffer mass of the produce samples, the height and width of pillar on the replicate surfaces and the variation of the replicated pillars height and width from the original silicon mould insert. Examination of the high density polyethylene replicates found that mould temperature was the most significant factor regarding pillar dimensions (and variation from the silicon mould insert) across the range of pillar sizes. Upon examination of the polypropylene replicates {{it was found that the}} factor of most significance on pillar dimensions varied across the different pillar sizes. Holding pressure was identified as the most significant factor with regards to the 53 x 29 and 19 x 80 micrometer pillars. Injection speed was found to be most significant for the 25 x 25 and 19 x 29 micrometer pillars. Cooling time was found to be most significant with regards to the 30 x 10, 25 x 10, 20 x 10 and 15 x 10 micrometer pillars. While ii mould temperature was found to be most significant for the 20 x 20, 15 x 15 and 10 x 30 micrometer pillars. The interaction between mould temperature and injection speed was also found to be the most significant factor with regards to the 43 x 29 and 25 x 30 micrometer pillars. Examination of the 316 LS replicates found that mould temperature was the most significant factor regarding pillar dimensions for 80 x 80 and 19 x 80 micrometer pillars. While holding pressure was found to be most significant to the 29 x 29 micrometer pillars and injection speed was identified as most significant to the 53 x 80 micrometer pillars. The samples produced during the design of experiment investigations were then used to examine the effect of surface texturing on droplet behaviour. Droplet contact angles were examined on polypropylene, high density polyethylene and silicon samples structured with 10 – 2 micrometer pillar. Initial droplet contact angles were found to be higher on the polypropylene samples than the high density polyethylene or silicon samples. With the lowest initial contact angles being found for the silicon inserts. Droplet ‘channelling’ and evaporation were examined on silicon, polypropylene, high density polyethylene and 316 LS samples structured with micro-channel surface pillars and holes ranging from 80 – 2 micrometer in diameter. Contact pinning of the droplet to the surface via the three- phase contact-line was noted during observations of droplet ‘channelling’. This pinning effect was observed at all sample tilt angles (30 - 90 o). With regards to droplet evaporation, the droplets were noted to evaporate evenly (with no or limited contact pinning) on all unstructured surfaces and the surfaces structured with hole features. On the surfaces structured with pillar features, the droplets appeared too evaporated along the surface gradient from the smallest pillars to the largest...|$|E

50|$|Mandal came to {{prominence}} {{with the publication}} of his book Ayodhya: Archaeology after Demolition in 1994. The book was written in response to two pieces of evidence. In 1990, the archaeologist B. B. Lal had announced that he had discovered <b>pillar</b> <b>bases</b> during his excavation in Ayodhya during 1975-80, next to the Babri Masjid site. This implied that there was another structure, presumably a temple, under the Babri Masjid, and gave rise to considerable consternation among the secularist academic groups. Secondly, after the demolition of Babri Masjid by the Vishva Hindu Parishad and allied groups in 1992, a number of figures and artifacts were discovered in the debris, which formed the basis for a booklet by Y. D. Sharma et al.Mandal's book was a critique of these two pieces of evidence. Of the <b>pillar</b> <b>bases</b> discovered by B. B. Lal, Mandal wrote that they were not aligned with one another and that they belonged to different cultural levels.At the World Archaeology Congress in 1998, Mandal stated that what were thought to be <b>pillar</b> <b>bases</b> were actually part of a wall, despite his prior assertion that they were not in alignment and belonged to different cultural levels. In an article in the New Age magazine in 1999, he also stated that the Gahadavala inscription found in the Babri Masjid debris, attesting to a Vishnu Hari temple, did not fall from the walls of the mosque and it was possibly brought in from elsewhere.|$|R
