Quite regularly, the webcam message is related to a musical theme on that particular evening's show.|$|R

40|$|Chagas {{disease is}} a chronic, tropical, {{parasitic}} disease, endemic throughout Latin America. The large-scale migration of populations has increased the geographic distribution {{of the disease and}} cases have been observed in many other countries around the world. To strengthen the critical mass of knowledge generated in different countries, it is essential to promote cooperative and translational research initiatives. We analyzed authorship of scientific documents on Chagas disease indexed in the Medline database from 1940 to 2009. Bibliometrics was used to analyze the evolution of collaboration patterns. A Social Network Analysis was carried out to identify the main research groups in the area by applying clustering methods. We then analyzed 13, 989 papers produced by 21, 350 authors. Collaboration among authors dramatically increased over the study period, reaching an average of 6. 2 authors per paper in the last five-year period. Applying a threshold of collaboration of five or more <b>papers</b> <b>signed</b> <b>in</b> co-authorship, we identified 148 consolidated research groups made up of 1, 750 authors. The Chagas disease network identified constitutes a "small world," characterized by a high degree of clustering and a notably high number of Brazilian researchers...|$|R

That ship, had taken part in the mutiny in England, and being just arrived from home, some danger was apprehended from the temper of the men. This was one reason why Nelson was removed to her. He had not been on board many weeks before a <b>paper,</b> <b>signed</b> <b>in</b> the name of all the ship's company, was dropped on the quarter-deck, containing these words: [...] "Success attend Admiral Nelson!

[...] Wherever Nelson commanded, the men soon became attached to him; in ten days' time he would have restored the most mutinous ship in the navy to order. Whenever an officer fails to win the affections of those who are under his command, he may be assured that the fault is chiefly in himself.|$|R

60|$|It {{had just}} come {{to him with a}} dismaying force that in the haste of his escape from Paris with the Vicomte he had {{forgotten}} to return to his lodging for a passport that he was fortunately possessed of. It was a laissez-passer, <b>signed</b> and left <b>in</b> <b>blank,</b> with which he had been equipped--against the possibility of the need for it arising--when he had started upon the Convention's errand to the Army of Dumouriez. Whilst on his way to Robespierre's house to secure the order of release, he had bethought him of filling in that passport for three persons, and thus, since to remain must entail his ruin and destruction, make his escape from France with Mademoiselle and the Vicomte. It was his only chance. Then in the hurry of the succeeding incidents, the excitement that had attended them, and the imperative need for haste in getting the Vicomte to Choisy, he had put the intended return to his lodging from his mind--overlooking until now the fact that not only must he go back for the valise which he had bidden Brutus pack, but also for that far more precious passport.|$|R

She burst into tears on the first occasion she was brought <b>papers</b> to <b>sign</b> <b>in</b> George's stead. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of Lord Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as First Lord of the Admiralty. Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory Lord Pembroke to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of Lord President of the Council and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.|$|R

Unaware of this, Shahida, after her mandatory 96-day period of waiting (iddat), remarried. Her first husband, rebounding from a failed attempt at a second marriage, decided he wanted his first wife Shahida back. Shahida's second marriage was ruled invalid. She and her second husband, Sarwar were charged with adultery. They were sentenced to death by stoning. The public criticism led to their retrial and acquittal by the Federal Shariah Court.|$|R

40|$|We {{study and}} {{classify}} quarter-BPS AdS 5 systems in M-theory, whose internal six-dimensional geometry is a T 2 bundle over a Riemann surface and two interval directions. The general system presented, provides a unified description of all known AdS 5 solutions in M-theory. These systems {{are governed by}} two functions, one that corresponds to the conformal factor of the Riemann surface and another that describes the T 2 fibration. We find solutions that can be organized into two classes. In the first one, solutions are specified by the conformal factor of the Riemann surface which satisfies a warped generalization of the SU(infinity) Toda equation. The system in the second class requires the Riemann surface to be S 2, H 2 or T 2. Class one contains the M-theory AdS 5 solutions of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena; the solutions of Maldacena and Nunez; the solutions of Gauntlett, Martelli, Sparks and Waldram; and the eleven-dimensional uplift of the Y(p,q) metrics. The second includes the recently found solutions of Beem, Bobev, Wecht and the author. Within each class there are new solutions that will be studied in a companion <b>paper.</b> Comment: <b>Signs</b> <b>in</b> warp factor corrected. References adde...|$|R
