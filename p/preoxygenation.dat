50|$|The aim of <b>preoxygenation</b> is {{to replace}} the {{nitrogen}} that forms {{the majority of the}} functional residual capacity with oxygen. This provides an oxygen reservoir in the lungs that will delay the depletion of oxygen in the absence of ventilation (after paralysis).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Since strenuous {{exercise}} for 10 min during <b>preoxygenation</b> {{was shown to}} provide better protection from decompression sickness (DCS) incidence than resting <b>preoxygenation,</b> a logical question was: would {{a longer period of}} strenuous exercise improve protection even further? HYPOTHESIS: Increased strenuous exercise duration during <b>preoxygenation</b> increases DCS protection. METHODS: There were 60 subjects, 30 men and 30 women, who were exposed to 9, 144 m (4. 3 psia) for 4 h while performing mild, upper body exercise. Before the exposures, each subject performed three <b>preoxygenation</b> profiles on different days in balanced order: a 90 -min resting <b>preoxygenation</b> control; a 240 -min resting <b>preoxygenation</b> control; and a 90 -min <b>preoxygenation</b> including exercise during the first 15 min. The subjects were monitored at altitude for venous gas emboli (VGE) with an echo-imaging system and observed for signs and symptoms of DCS. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences in}} occurrence of DCS following any of the three <b>preoxygenation</b> procedures. Results were also comparable to an earlier report of 42 % DCS with a 60 -min <b>preoxygenation</b> including a 10 -min exercise. There was no difference between VGE incidence in the comparison of protection offered by a 90 -min <b>preoxygenation</b> with or without 13 min of strenuous exercise. The DCS incidence following a 240 -min resting <b>preoxygenation,</b> 40 %, was higher than observed during NASA studies and nearly identical with the earlier 42 % DCS after a 60 -min <b>preoxygenation</b> including exercise during the first 10 min.

40|$|Introduction: Tracheal {{intubation}} in {{the intensive}} care unit (ICU) is associated with severe life-threatening complications including severe hypoxaemia. <b>Preoxygenation</b> before intubation has been recommended in order to decrease such complications. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) -assisted <b>preoxygenation</b> allows increased oxygen saturation during the intubation procedure, by applying a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to prevent alveolar derecruitment. However, the NIV mask has to be taken off after <b>preoxygenation</b> to allow the passage of the tube through the mouth. The patient with hypoxaemia does not receive oxygen during this period, at risk of major hypoxaemia. High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) has a potential for apnoeic oxygenation during the apnoea period following the <b>preoxygenation</b> with NIV. Whether application of HFNC combined with NIV is more effective at reducing oxygen desaturation during the intubation procedure compared with NIV alone for <b>preoxygenation</b> in patients with hypoxaemia in the ICU with acute respiratory failure remains to be established. Methods and analysis: The HFNC combined to NIV for decreasing oxygen desaturation during the intubation procedure in patients with hypoxaemia in the ICU (OPTINIV) trial is an investigator-initiated monocentre randomised controlled two-arm trial with assessor-blinded outcome assessment. The OPTINIV trial randomises 50 patients with hypoxaemia requiring orotracheal intubation for acute respiratory failure to receive NIV (pressure support= 10, PEEP= 5, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) = 100 %) combined with HFNC (flow= 60 L/min, FiO(2) = 100 %, interventional group) or NIV alone (reference group) for <b>preoxygenation.</b> The primary outcome is lowest oxygen saturation during the intubation procedure. Secondary outcomes are intubation-related complications, quality of <b>preoxygenation</b> and ICU mortality. Ethics and dissemination: The study project has been approved by the appropriate ethics committee (CPP Sud-Mediterranee). Informed consent is required. If combined application of HFNC and NIV for <b>preoxygenation</b> of patients with hypoxaemia in the ICU proves superior to NIV <b>preoxygenation,</b> its use will become standard practice, thereby decreasing hypoxaemia during the intubation procedure and potential complications related to intubation...|$|E
40|$|The {{fermentation}} process is of major importance in beer production. During fermentation, yeast cells use the available nutrients in wort {{for growth and}} maintenance metabolism. In order to grow during the first fermentation phase, yeast cells need to synthesize appropriate levels of essential membrane compounds. Hence, one major role of dissolved oxygen is to promote the biosynthesis of ergosterol and unsaturated fatty acids in brewery fermentations. Traditionally, oxygen is provided through wort oxygenation but this technique has several disadvantages. In order to avoid those, yeast cells can be directly exposed to oxygen before fermentation in a controlled process known as <b>preoxygenation,</b> thereby removing the requirement for subsequent wort oxygenation. However, industrial applications of this technique are scarce, due to the inconsistent and limited scientific studies {{and the lack of}} knowledge regarding the biochemical background of the <b>preoxygenation</b> of yeast cells. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to examine the influence of <b>preoxygenation</b> on beer production parameters and to gain better insight in the yeast’s metabolism during both processes. First of all, the <b>preoxygenation</b> ability of different ale and lager yeast strains was studied. Despite the different response of the yeast strains tested, successful results have been achieved. Large variations in sterol and UFA synthesis during <b>preoxygenation</b> were observed. Though, the fermentation performance of preoxygenated yeast cells in de-aerated wort was a good indication for the success of the treatment. In a next series of experiments, the possibility to use yeast <b>preoxygenation</b> {{as an alternative to the}} conventional wort aeration process in normal brewing practice has been studied on pilote scale. This demonstrated that the use of the <b>preoxygenation</b> technique enables us to produce beers with similar characteristics as the traditionally brewed beers. Yeast fermentation performance, yeast growth and aroma compound formation were comparable. Profiles of sterols and unsaturated fatty acid levels during <b>preoxygenation</b> and subsequent fermentation or during the traditional fermentation also seemed to be very similar. Moreover, cropping of the yeast cells and reuse of them after <b>preoxygenation</b> has proven to be possible without loss of quality. It could also be concluded that <b>preoxygenation</b> can be used successfully for re{{fermentation process}}es. Though, since preoxygenated yeast cells seem to be more sensitive to the storage conditions than untreated yeast cells, it is recommended to use fresh yeast cells, as stored cells are generally of inferior physiological condition. In general, it is suggested to minimize the yeast storage time at temperatures as low as possible. We also performed a comparative genome-wide expression analysis on yeast samples harvested during the exponential phase of the fermentation in order to compare yeast behavior during fermentation after <b>preoxygenation</b> or wort aeration. No major differences in gene expression halfway fermentation were obtained, proving once again that <b>preoxygenation</b> and wort aeration lead to similar results. However, aeration of both yeast and wort resulted in a slightly shorter exponential phase, bringing the yeast faster into stationary phase. This resulted in biosynthetically more active yeast cells, with an enhanced yeast growth and an overall increased fermentation performance (14 %). Microarray analyses demonstrated that the expression of yeast genes involved in amino acid metabolism, reserve carbohydrate metabolism and stress resistance were accordingly affected. Next, a first attempt was made to better characterize the oxygen need of yeast cells. Yeast cells must be capable of responding rapidly at the physiological level to changes in their oxygen environment, for example to protect themselves against potential oxidative stress. Using real-time PCR, genes involved in transcriptional control, respiration, detoxification, stress response and lipid metabolism were examined during <b>preoxygenation.</b> This experiment showed that, during <b>preoxygenation,</b> the yeast cells seem to acquire stress resistance as they accumulate the stress-protectant trehalose and induce the expression of genes involved in detoxification processes and of stress-responsive genes. Finally, the general belief is that wort aeration has a negative impact on wort quality, which could result in more rapid beer staling. Since this study showed that almost identical beers could be produced with the <b>preoxygenation</b> as with the wort-aeration technique, <b>preoxygenation</b> proved to be the ideal tool to investigate the effect of wort aeration on beer flavor stability. GC-MS analyses and sensory analysis did not reveal significant differences in beer staling between the wort aeration and the <b>preoxygenation</b> treatment, for pilsner as well as for ale type beers. Therefore it can be stated that the classical wort aeration process does not have a negative impact on beer ageing. It can be concluded that yeast <b>preoxygenation</b> is a worthy alternative to wort aeration. Moreover, our study has provided several new insights into the behavior of yeast cells during the <b>preoxygenation</b> and fermentation process in normal brewing practice. status: publishe...|$|E

METHODS: Sixty-six consecutive patients (body mass index, 46 ± 6 kg/m²) were randomized to receive 5 min of either conventional <b>preoxygenation</b> with spontaneous breathing of 100 % O₂ (CON), NPPV (pressure support and positive end-expiratory pressure), or NPPV followed by RM (NPPV+RM).

The interaction between reduced lung volume, resulting in airway closure, and varying inspiratory fractions of oxygen (FIO 2) in determining the risk of developing atelectasis is still obscure. Methods: In this thesis, computed tomography (in studies I and II during anaesthesia, in studies III and IV postoperatively) was used to investigate the area of atelectasis in relation to FIO 2 and varying levels of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Study I investigated the short-term influence of reducing FIO 2 during <b>preoxygenation</b> and induction of general anaesthesia, and the time to hypoxia during apnoea. Study II focused on the long-term effect of an FIO 2 of 0. 8 for <b>preoxygenation.</b> Study III applied CPAP/PEEP with an FIO 2 of 1. 0 or 0. 8 for pre- and postoxygenation until extubation. After extubation, CPAP with an FIO 2 of 0. 3 was applied before the end of mask ventilation. Study IV compared two groups given CPAP/PEEP during anaesthesia and an FIO 2 of 1. 0 or 0. 3 during postoxygenation, but without CPAP after extubation. Results: Study I showed a reduction in atelectasis with an FIO 2 of 0. 8 or 0. 6, compared with 1. 0, but the time to hypoxia decreased. In study II, atelectasis evolved gradually after <b>preoxygenation.</b> In study III, atelectasis was reduced with an FIO 2 of 1. 0 and CPAP/PEEP compared with an FIO 2 of 1. 0 without CPAP/PEEP. The intervention failed in the group given an FIO 2 of 0. 8, this group had more smokers. Atelectasis and age were correlated. In study IV, no difference was found between the groups. Post hoc analysis showed that smoking and ASA class increased the risk for atelectasis. Conclusion, the effect of reducing FIO 2 during <b>preoxygenation</b> to prevent atelectasis might be short-lived. A lower FIO 2 shortened the time to the appearance of hypoxia. Increasing lung volume by using CPAP/PEEP also decreased the risk of atelectasis, but the method might fail; for example in patients who are heavy smokers.

Methods 　Thirty-nine recruits coming from plains (799 m or 620 m height above sea level) were involved in our study. They were randomly divided into 3 groups: experimental group I (n= 12), experimental groupⅡ (n= 12), and control group (n= 15). The group I had 1 L/min low concentration <b>preoxygenation</b> for 30 min, and groupⅡ had 2 L/min for 30 min, once a day for 3 days. No <b>preoxygenation</b> in control group. The new recruits's PWC 170 values were measured by stepping stairs for evaluating their physical ability, and the new recruits's coping responses were investigated with "Physical Training Coping Scale", and then those data compared with these of 98 soldiers stationed in Tibet (senior soldier group, stationed in Tibet for at least 2 years). Results 　Each basic PWC 170 values showed no significant diffierence between group Ⅰand Ⅱ (P> 0. 05). Each basic PWC 170 was significantly higher in the experimental groups Ⅰand Ⅱthan in control group (P 0. 05). Correlation analysis showed {{that there was a}} significant positive correlation between the "active response" factor and basic PWC 170 value, and between "emotional management" factor and PWC 170 value on second day between the two experimental groups (r= 0. 329 and 0. 344 respectively, P< 0. 05). There was also a significant correlation between PWC 170 values (day 1, day 2 and day 3), and the correlation coefficients were between 0. 570 and 0. 594 (P< 0. 01). Conclusions 　Low concentration <b>preoxygenation</b> possibly can improve the physical fitness level of new recruits'. To certain extent, the basic PWC 170 {{may be related to the}} coping style of "active response" of new recruits to Tibet in physical training, while the maintenance of physical fitness level may be associated with "emotional management" factor...|$|E
30|$|<b>Preoxygenation</b> using HFNC {{prior to}} {{intubation}} was safe in critically ill patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. There {{were no significant}} differences in gas exchange before and after intubation comparing the HFNC group and the BVM group. However, in contrast to the BVM group there was no significant decrease in SpO 2 during the apnea phase prior to intubation within the HFNC group.|$|E
40|$|Objective: In this study, it {{was aimed}} to {{investigate}} the hemodynamic effects of sevoflurane in low flow anesthesia (LFA) without nitrous oxide. Methods: A total of 40 ASA I-II patients aged between 18 - 70 years were included in this study. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups.

30|$|Physicians {{handled the}} {{scenarios}} consecutively, in a randomized and crossover design. Participants {{were informed that}} ETI was {{the main purpose of}} the study and that global care was not required. <b>Preoxygenation</b> and rapid sequence induction were considered already carried out. ECG and pulse oximetry monitor, and all necessary devices were placed beside the manikin, and if required, operators could ask for a gum elastic bougie.|$|E
30|$|To {{render the}} animals’ lungs more {{susceptible}} to VILI, surfactant depletion was performed by saline lavage in all animals. After <b>preoxygenation</b> with FiO 2 1.0, 30  ml/kg of 38  °C 0.9 % sterile normal saline was instilled into the trachea and then allowed to drain passively through the tracheal tube. The procedure was repeated {{a total of four}} times, interspaced by a short recovery period to allow the arterial oxygen saturation to return to at least 96 %.|$|E
30|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} in this study. Experienced airway sonologists {{are aware that}} differences in probe pressure applied while scanning the neck can significantly alter measurements of these superficial neck structures. It was thus emphasized during the ultrasound airway training that the sonologist place the probe against the neck with the least pressure needed to maintain skin contact. The goal of minimal probe pressure also coheres with the principle of avoiding anything that might narrow the upper airway in a dyspneic patient receiving <b>preoxygenation.</b>|$|E
30|$|<b>Preoxygenation</b> is {{intended}} to reduce desaturation and hypoxaemia in the drug-induced apnoeic phase of RSI. Application of 100  % oxygen via nasal prongs promotes movement of oxygen-enriched air into the alveoli during apnoea, which can help sustain SaO 2. The majority of studies, though of variable methodology suggest a benefit with apnoeic oxygenation with improvement in SaO 2 during the apnoeic phase or difficult laryngoscopy. One RCT comparing apnoeic oxygenation to standard facemask oxygen prior to laryngoscopy failed to show any benefit of apnoeic oxygenation.|$|E
