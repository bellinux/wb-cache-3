Potztausand, he won't read it!"--repeated the general, his eyes flashing and his clenched fist striking in the air--"What sort of combatants are these of the British Navy who refuse to read our war-books? The Kaiser's Heligoland speech! They never read a word of it. The Furchtbarkeit-Proklamation of August,--they never looked at it. The Reichstags-Rede with the <b>printed</b> <b>picture</b> of the Kaiser shaking hands with everybody,--they used it to wrap up sandwiches! What are they, then, Jellicoe and his men?

5000|$|Trade Mark of Quality was {{established}} in 1970 by [...] "Dub" [...] Taylor and Ken Douglas. They were quality-conscious perfectionists who pressed all their albums on coloured, virgin vinyl, and perhaps the first bootleggers to start producing <b>printed</b> <b>picture</b> covers, and later colour picture covers, rather than paper inserts. Taylor and Douglas had released several albums under different names before settling on [...] "Trade Mark Of Quality" [...] in 1969, the first being Great White Wonder by Bob Dylan. According to Douglas, Taylor recorded several of TMOQ's releases himself, including the Rolling Stones' Live'r Than You'll Ever Be and Led Zeppelin's Live On Blueberry Hill. TMOQ frequently released its albums with cover art by William Stout.|$|E
50|$|Magnification is a ratio between size {{of object}} on {{a picture and}} its real size. Unfortunately, {{magnification}} is somewhat a misleading parameter. It depends on a final size of a <b>printed</b> <b>picture,</b> and therefore varies with variation in picture size. Editors of journals and magazines routinely resize a figure to fit the page, making any magnification number provided in the figure legend incorrect. A scale bar, or micron bar, is a bar of known length displayed on a picture. The bar {{can be used for}} measurements on a picture. When a picture is resized a bar is also resized. If a picture has a bar, the magnification can be easily calculated. Ideally, all pictures destined for publication/presentation should be supplied with a scale bar; the magnification ratio is optional. All but one (limestone) of the micrographs presented on this page do not have a micron bar; supplied magnification ratios are likely incorrect, as they were not calculated for pictures at the present size.|$|E
5000|$|Inks used {{in color}} {{printing}} presses are semi-transparent {{and can be}} printed {{on top of each}} other to produce different hues. For example, green results from printing yellow and cyan inks {{on top of each other}}. However, a printing press cannot vary the amount of ink applied to particular picture areas except through [...] "screening," [...] a process that represents lighter shades as tiny dots, rather than solid areas, of ink. This is analogous to mixing white paint into a color to lighten it, except the white is the paper itself. In process color printing, the screened image, or halftone for each ink color is printed in succession. The screen grids are set at different angles, and the dots therefore create tiny rosettes, which, through a kind of optical illusion, appear to form a continuous-tone image. You can view the halftoning, which enables printed images, by examining a <b>printed</b> <b>picture</b> under magnification.|$|E

5000|$|In Britain, postcards without {{images were}} {{issued by the}} Post Office in 1870, and were printed with a stamp {{as part of the}} design, which was {{included}} in the price of purchase. These cards came in two sizes. The larger size was found to be slightly too large for ease of handling, and was soon withdrawn in favour of cards 13mm (½ inch) shorter. The first known <b>printed</b> <b>picture</b> postcard, with an image on one side, was created in France in 1870 at Camp Conlie by Léon Besnardeau (1829-1914). Conlie was a training camp for soldiers in the Franco-Prussian war. The cards had a lithographed design printed on them containing emblematic images of piles of armaments on either side of a scroll topped by the arms of the Duchy of Brittany and the inscription [...] "War of 1870. Camp Conlie. Souvenir of the National Defence. Army of Brittany". While these are certainly the first known picture postcards, there was no space for stamps and no evidence that they were ever posted without envelopes.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{identifying}} digital camera sensor from a <b>printed</b> <b>picture.</b> The sensor is identified by proving the presence of its Photo-Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) in the scanned picture using camera ID methods robust to cropping and scaling. Two kinds of prints are studied. The first are postcard size (4 &quot; by 6 &quot;) pictures obtained from common commercial printing labs. These prints are always cropped to some degree. In the proposed identification, a brute force search for the scaling ratio is deployed while the position of cropping is determined from the cross-correlation surface. Detection success mostly depends on the picture content {{and the quality of}} the PRNU estimate. Prints obtained using desktop printers form the second kind of pictures investigated in this paper. Their identification is complicated by complicated geometric distortion due to imperfections in paper feed. Removing this distortion is part of the identification procedure. From experiments, we determine the range of conditions under which reliable sensor identification is possible. The most influential factors in identifying the sensor from a <b>printed</b> <b>picture</b> are the accuracy of angular alignment when scanning, printing quality, paper quality, and size of the <b>printed</b> <b>picture.</b> Keywords: Camera identification, Photo-Response Non-Uniformity, printed images identification. 1...|$|E

40|$|Color {{management}} {{has become more}} common now than ever in the graphic trade. Calibration andcharcterization are words that are mentioned very often {{when it comes to}} controlling colors andwhen you want a <b>printed</b> <b>picture</b> to look the same as an original photograph. The problem is thatthere are not so many people that has the knowlegde about this subject. Even if a printer supportscolor management it is not sure that the result is going to be satisfied and that a <b>printed</b> <b>picture</b> isgoing to look the same as the original. The printers which were used were Hp DeskJet 970 Cxi, Xerox Docu Color 12 and AgfaChromapress 50 i. The theory of color, colour management and the equipment which were usedare described in the first stage. The second stage describes calibration and characterization ofmonitors, scanners and printers. Finally the result of created ICC-profiles is set by visual comparisionof a photographs original colours and a scanned and printed photograph. The results of calibration and characterization were varying a lot. Agfa Chromapress 50 i was theonly printer which could produce a succesful calibration. Agfa Chromapress 50 i and XeroxDocuColor 12 gave the best results when comparing original photographs with printed pictures ifthey were separated with ICC-profiles. ICC-profiles created for Hp DeskJet 970 Cxi achievedundesirable effects. This was the only printer that gave a bad result both with and without ICCprofiles. The reason for this miserable result can depend on the printers unability to fully supportcolor management...|$|E
40|$|Retrieval-by-capture {{applications}} allow a user to scan a <b>printed</b> <b>picture</b> in {{a newspaper}} or magazine with a mobile camera to then automatically trigger the display of predetermined related content. To ensure a high user Quality of Experience (QoE), this paper proposes a fast and accurate low bit rate solution for retrieval-by-capture applications based on extracting Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features from images reconstructed from the low spatial frequency components. The system applies a two-dimensional block-based Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), as typically used in image coders, and only encodes and transmits the resulting DC components. Received images are decoded using these components and SIFT features are derived and then used to find a matching image within a database of candidate images. Results show that the proposed system achieves more than 97 % matching accuracy when evaluated {{for a wide range}} of typical image distortions including scaling, rotation, additive noise, image blurring and illumination. Transmission data rates are comparable to existing compressed domain image features whilst significantly reducing system latency...|$|E
