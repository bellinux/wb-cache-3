5|$|Elections {{are governed}} by the State Electoral Commission and electoral boards. Members of those bodies are {{required}} to have a university degree in law, {{and they may not}} be members of any political party. The State Electoral Commission prepares and manages elections in accordance with legislation, appoints lower-ranking election-commission and board members, issues directives to such bodies and supervises their work. The State Electoral Commission compiles and publishes candidate lists, supervises the legality of political campaigns and compiles and publishes election results. All members of election boards (or their legal deputies) must be present at assigned <b>polling</b> stations at all times while the <b>polling</b> station is open. The board verifies the identity of voters against the list of registered voters and records the turnout. The turnout number is later checked against number of votes cast; if the number of votes exceeds the turnout, the election at that <b>polling</b> station must be repeated. Votes are tallied by hand, and that information is forwarded (along with all other records kept at the <b>polling</b> station) to the State Electoral Commission.|$|E
