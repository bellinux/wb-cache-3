This comparison addresses in particular tool path, but also includes number of lines, cycle time and energy consumption. The comparison is carried out through a case study: a mechanical component was designed so as to produce a number of CNC part programs generated with two different CAM systems; one more program was directly programmed by the authors in the machine tool's controller. Different sample parts were produced using the same machine tool, tooling and process parameters; and measurements of energy consumption and cycle time were gathered. The results show differences between the tool paths generated by each approach and are used by the authors to further define strategies to produce trajectories that could reduce cycle time and energy consumption...|$|E

40|$|Design for Manufacturability is a {{concurrent}} engineering strategy aimed at providing the manufacturability {{feedback to the}} designers at the early design stages. A group technology coding and classification system for stamping is integrated into a feature-based part representation system. A thin-walled part is designed with features such as flat walls, holes, and intersections. The integrated system can then automatically provide the manufacturability feedback {{in terms of the}} cost drivers present at the configuration stage, and in terms of GT <b>part</b> <b>code,</b> relative cost, and redesign suggestions at the parametric stage. A strip layout module can automatically generate the most acceptable strip layout of a manufacturable stamped part at the configuration stage. ^ The heart of the integrated system is the feature-converter. It defines the mapping between a set of design features with a set of manufacturing features. The mapping is an implementation of manufacturing rules based on physical principles and tool designers 2 ̆ 7 experiences. ^ Currently, the parts for which the strip layout can be produced automatically, forms a small subset of the parts for which the automatic manufacturability evaluation can be performed. However, it is concluded {{that it is possible to}} implement a CIM system wherein a feature-based stamped part design can first be optimized for producibility, and then the other downstream activities such as the strip layout and tool design can be carried out automatically for at least a limited domain of parts. ...|$|E

"Curse ofThe Golden Flower" film by Zhang Yi Mou is Mandarin’s film that tell us about glorious periode of Tang’s Dynasty on seventh century in China. Castle family that telling on the film are; Emperor Ping, Consort of King Phoenix and three brothers, they are; Prince Jie, Prince Xiang and Prince Yu. "Curse of The Golden Flower" film have complicated family conflict as the theme. Conflict or contradiction is social process were individual or group make effort to reach its goal, with challenge the opponent along with threaths and criminals. Semiotics are branch of science that relates with signs and symbols production as a <b>part</b> <b>code</b> system that are used to communicate information. The goal {{of this study is to}} know about the meaning of film conflict in "Curse of The Golden Flower"’s film that use semiotics analysis, Charles Sanders Peirce bring about semiotics analyzing throught three sign typologies that are index, icon, and symbol, then use Roland Barthes’s semiotics analysis including signifier, signified, level of connotation, denotation, and myth. Myth is Barthes’s comcept that describes meaning more implicitly because more give possibility that connection with cultural, morality and ideology. Researcher also use binary opposition theory said by Levi Strauss to plotting two poles in contrary direction on a conflict. In addition to researcher also give Arthur Asa Berger’s media analysis theori to analyze role and character ina film and Vladimir Propp’s subject function theori to analyze figue/actor’s type and characters. Furthermore, conflict are analizing that reconciliation with any comflist theories. The method in this study is interpretative qualitative. This study find the fact with appropriate interpretate, its goal are make description, sketch or ilustration sistematically, factual, and accurate about sign and the meaning in a film. There are 10 scenes and 50 shots are tested. Scene and shot are the representative of some signs that representating meaning of conflict.
