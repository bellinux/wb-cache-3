5|$|Alley {{was one of}} the few {{figures who}} were trusted by {{northern}} and southern Dahomeyans alike. His role was only temporary, until power was to be ceded back to civilians in six months time. Among the events on the official timetable, which the military published on January 17, 1968, was the creation of a nonmilitary Constitution Commission on January 31, which would write a new Dahomeyan constitution. The document granted Alley strong executive power, and was adopted by the Comite Militaire Revolutionaire, Alley's interim government comprisising only military officers, in early March. A national referendum on the constitution was held on March 31, which <b>passed</b> <b>with</b> 92 percent in favor.|$|E
5|$|As {{the weeks}} {{extended}} well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities {{to relieve the}} tedium. A permanent lookout was kept {{for the arrival of}} the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays, and anniversaries celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time <b>passed</b> <b>with</b> no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite, and on 15 June had to be amputated by the surgeons Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform that had survived in the medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55minutes, and was a complete success.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} several {{models of}} 1 -round classical and quantum communication, {{some of these}} models have not been defined before. We "almost separate" the models of simultaneous quantum message <b>passing</b> <b>with</b> shared entanglement and the model of simultaneous quantum message <b>passing</b> <b>with</b> shared randomness. We define a relation which can be efficiently exactly solved in the first model but cannot be solved efficiently, either exactly or in 0 -error setup in the second model. In fact, our relation is exactly solvable even in a more restricted model of simultaneous classical message <b>passing</b> <b>with</b> shared entanglement. As our second contribution we strengthen a result by Yao that a "very short" protocol from the model of simultaneous classical message <b>passing</b> <b>with</b> shared randomness can be simulated in the model of simultaneous quantum message passing: for a boolean function f, QII(f) ∈ exp(O(RIIp(f))) log n. We show a similar result for protocols from a (stronger) model of 1 -way classical message <b>passing</b> <b>with</b> shared randomness: QII(f) ∈ exp(O(RIp(f))) log n. We demonstrate a problem whose efficient solution in the model of simultaneous quantum message passing follows from our result but not from Yao's.

5|$|Despite ongoing {{financial}} difficulties, Cerna {{graduated from}} university in 1906. His thesis was <b>passed</b> <b>with</b> a Magna cum laude qualifier. He was by then seriously ill with tuberculosis, and sought {{a change in}} climate. Cerna spent much of this period traveling through the Old Kingdom, and several times visited regions of the Southern Carpathians, in particular the area of Rucăr, the Bucegi Mountains, and the Jiu Valley. As Călinescu notes, he had bought himself a horse from a Rucăr local on credit, and failed to deliver the promised sum on time.|$|E
5|$|During the {{elections}} of 1866, Heliade Rădulescu won {{a seat in the}} Chamber as a deputy for the city of Târgovişte. As Cuza had been ousted from power by a coalition of political groupings, he was the only Wallachian deputy to join Nicolae Ionescu and other disciples of Simion Bărnuţiu in opposing the appointment of Carol of Hohenzollern as Domnitor and a proclamation stressing the perpetuity of the Moldo-Wallachian union. Speaking in Parliament, he likened the adoption of foreign rule to the Phanariote period. The opposition was nevertheless weak, and the resolution was <b>passed</b> <b>with</b> a large majority.|$|E
5|$|Following Jefferson's {{return to}} Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but {{initially}} {{thought that he}} had taken on another engineer in Dover and had gone fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks <b>passed</b> <b>with</b> no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised by the arrival of bills from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E
