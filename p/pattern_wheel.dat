40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} research interests of solidarity, loyalty and social lives of children owned by the punk community {{to members of the}} community. In this case there is certainly a communications network that is formed in the punk community in the town of Blitar, is what makes relationships in this community can be established. What makes the communication network that occurred in this community gave birth to the activities that are often held by this punk community. Activities are usually done in this community usually like about the procurement of musical events, social events and the events on the environment. These activities are done jointly with one capital and one aim embroidery. Thus, in this study, researchers are interested to know how the communications network in the punk community in the town of Blitar this happen? Then found the problem is how the communication network within the punk community in the town of Blitar in the treat-tight relationship between fellow members of the punk community. To answer that in the formulation of the problem put forward regarding the communication network, the research method used was qualitative research methods, researchers in this research using network analysis as a method of research, namely the method of research which is based on the convergence of communication models that melandas on cybernetic theory. Data collected by observation, interview and documentation directly to the informants using snowball sampling technique. Then presented with the data obtained and sociogram sosiometri. To maintain credibility of research results, researchers using the technique of 'triangulation of sources "as keabsahaan engineering data. From the results of research on communication networks in the communities in the treat-tight punk hubungn among communities in the town of Blitar punk there are three problems, namely: (1) punk community communication network in the town of Blitar, is formed from the activities which they often interact, ask questions and exchange information about the punk community in the town of Blitar. So, with these activities rise to a sense of solidarity and loyalty are stronger in this community. (2) there are three clicks in the punk community communication network, click the first form of communication network <b>pattern</b> <b>wheel,</b> click the second communication network patterning "Y" and click on the third or click on a majority of the communication network that formed the pattern is the pattern of star communication network or a star pattern or pattern of all channels.

In addition cybernetic theory shows that the behavior of an individual or individuals are determined by social relations, rather than on individual characteristics, so in this case there are the roles each member of the punk community communication network group formed from what was done by members of the community groups...|$|E
