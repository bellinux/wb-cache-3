5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using local materials. Buildings {{were made}} out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by two lamps to light it at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with planks, coated in clay. Few of these houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verde is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock {{overhangs}} along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{in the way}} of Okabe's advance was A Company of the 2/6th Infantry Battalion under Captain W. H. Sherlock. Okabe {{ordered an}} all-out attack on Sherlock's {{position}} on 28 January. Sherlock was forced from his position and retreated onto a nearby spur. For much of the afternoon, frontal Japanese attacks were repelled by Australian mortar and machine gun fire, and efforts to infiltrate Sherlock's positions were defeated by a bayonet attack led by Sherlock in person. By 18:00, Sherlock's mortar ammunition had run out and his small arms ammunition was running short, while his position was being <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> mortar rounds and swept by machine gun fire. Sherlock held on through the night and was killed the next day trying to break through the Japanese lines. For his actions, Sherlock was posthumously mentioned in despatches.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in the 19th century, {{numerous}} {{copies of}} the statue {{have been made in}} bronze and <b>plaster,</b> <b>with</b> molds often made directly from the original.|$|R

5|$|The vernacular {{architecture}} of Scotland, as elsewhere, {{made use of}} local materials and methods. The homes of the poor were usually of very simple construction, and were built by groups of family and friends. Stone is plentiful throughout Scotland and was a common building material, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. As in English {{vernacular architecture}}, where wood was available, crucks (pairs of curved timbers) were often used to support the roof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls. Walls were often built of stone, and could have gaps filled with turf, or <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> clay. In some regions wattled walls filled in with turf were employed, sometimes on a stone base. Turf-filled walls were not long-lasting, {{and had to be}} rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. Different regions used turfs, or thatch of broom, heather, straw or reeds for roofing.|$|E
25|$|A {{foundation}} of pilings and heavy timbers {{were built in}} Lake Michigan, at the north-east corner of the exposition grounds. The sides of Illinois were constructed of brick, <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> cement. The hull structure was carefully constructed to match the contour of the Indiana-class warships.|$|E
25|$|Within 17 {{years the}} wall of the {{structure}} began to sag and needed attention. The main issue was the traditional mound the structure was built on, which was designed for a typical Hawaiian hut. The weight of the building was too much. To attempt a fix, the entire building was <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> mortar.|$|E
50|$|Ceilings are {{generally}} gypsum <b>plaster</b> <b>with</b> acoustic perforations {{and may be}} fixed directly to the concrete slab. In the west wing there is some variation in the size and pattern of the panels.|$|R

25|$|The pupa is stubby, with {{protruding}} {{eyes and}} a prominent projection on the head in between them. The pupa may be light brown or violaceous. The body tapers away from the shoulders towards the rear. The abdomen is creamish with a row of four black spots on each side. The pupa is shiny, but <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> a white powder.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the {{southwest}} Ancestral Puebloan region, and at Mesa Verde, the best-known {{site for the}} large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, housing, defensive, and storage complexes were built in shallow caves and under rock overhangs along canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> adobe mortar.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{appearance}} had {{not changed}} much by the 18th century. Houses were made of pine and spruce logs, with shingled roofs <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> sod or covered by birch bark. The rebuilding of Moscow {{in the second half}} of the 18th century was necessitated not only by constant fires, but also the needs of the nobility. Much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style.|$|E

25|$|The burial chamber has a base {{measurement}} of 29ft x 17ft and {{a height of}} 15ft. It was also left unfinished, but surprisingly a nearly completely arranged burial was found. The sarcophagus {{in the midst of}} the chamber is made of polished alabaster and shows an unusual feature: its opening lies at the front side and is sealed by a sliding door, which was still <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> mortar when the sarcophagus was found. The sarcophagus was empty, however and it remains unclear whether the site was ransacked after burial or whether King Sekhemkhet was buried elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{the lack}} of {{contemporary}} building materials, most of the buildings in the village were constructed from loose masonry stone, and filled with gravel or stone. Only the homes of the landed gentry and the principal facades of the better properties were <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> clay. Yet, the lower quality clays on the island meant that these too were weaker and easily crumpled. The difficulty to produce tile locally, meant the richer nobles and religious buildings were covered in tile, while poorer homes were framed in culm and covered with hay or straw. The elevated hardness of the basalt stone, made working the material difficult, creating rounded surfaces that were fragile to masonry, that when combined with the elevated weight of the walls, resulted in constructions that were vulnerable to seismic activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to change the}} system was accelerated by three considerations: The first problem arose with the establishment of the Dar ul-Funun medical school. Since Islam considers unnecessary dissection of corpses as a form of mutilation, thus forbidding it, there were no corpses for study available through official channels. The towers were repeatedly broken into, much to the dismay and humiliation of the Zoroastrian community. Secondly, while the towers had originally been built away from population centers, the growth of the towns led to the towers now being within city limits. Finally, many of the Zoroastrians themselves found the system outdated. Following long negotiations between the anjuman societies of Yazd, Kerman, and Tehran, the latter gained a majority and established a cemetery some 10km from Tehran at Ghassr-e Firouzeh (Firouzeh's Palace). The graves were lined with rocks and <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> cement to prevent direct contact with the earth. In Yazd and Kerman, in addition to cemeteries, orthodox Zoroastrians continued to maintain a tower until the 1970s when ritual exposure was prohibited by law.|$|E

25|$|Four {{years after}} aggregation, Prime, which {{had had a}} stop/start {{approach}} to local news in Canberra, decided to take on CTC head-to-head with a one-hour local/national/international 6pm news bulletin. Prime's first attempt at news in Canberra saw the station lure CTC alumnus John Bok back from Adelaide in 1989 to produce and front a 30-minute local news bulletin. However Prime couldn't drag the audience from CTC and in April 1991 the bulletin was scaled back to a five-minute update shown {{at the end of}} Seven Nightly News from Sydney. In 1993 Prime decided to try again and a team of 26 including Ken Begg and Geoff Hiscock, both poached from CTC, were brought together to upgrade Prime's news. The now nationally known faces of Melissa Doyle and Jessica Rowe would also join Prime's news team. Meanwhile, sports presenter Greg Robson took over from Hiscock anchoring Capital Eyewitness News at CTC alongside Kininmonth and WIN maintained its half-hour local news bulletin anchored by veteran Canberra broadcaster Peter Leonard. Prime's 6 O'clock News commenced on 1 March 1993 amid a high-profile advertising campaign. For the first time since aggregation, viewers had the choice of three locally produced television 6pm news bulletins, two of which were composite local, national and international. 1993 would {{go down in history as}} the pinnacle of local TV choice for Canberra, with buses and newspapers <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> the faces of three newsrooms. But it wasn't to last and by Christmas 1993 Prime had scaled back its one-hour composite to a half-hour local bulletin. Capital Eyewitness News prevailed as the number one news program followed by fierce rival WIN. The newscast, with the purchase of Southern Cross Broadcasting of the channel, became Ten Capital Eyewitness News in 1994, and later on as Ten News on Capital that same year, in line with the Network Ten news rebrand, moving back to 5PM after 2 years.|$|E
500|$|The front (west side) of {{the garage}} is made of the same mosaic gray brick that {{was used for the}} {{construction}} of the church and the rectory. [...] The north and south walls are both made of two different materials: the western two-thirds of them is red brick, possibly from the brickyard that once operated in Madison; the easternmost third is <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> a layer of cement, painted red to match the bricks. [...] The rear (east) wall is also <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> red cement. [...] It is speculated that the garage was either lengthened to fit a longer car, or that the eastern third had to be rebuilt; the building's hip roof shows no signs of having been lengthened.|$|E
500|$|Gramercy ran a pre-release {{promotion}} and advertising campaign before The Usual Suspects {{opened in the}} summer of 1995.

[...] The eastward projection contained a large kitchen and hall; the southward projection, a somewhat smaller parlor and dining room. [...] A steep stairway led up to an unfinished attic. [...] The floors were packed dirt; the ceiling was muslin tacked beneath boards. [...] The interior of the sod walls was <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> a mixture of clay, straw, and hog hair.|$|E
500|$|Walls {{and public}} {{transport}} vehicles were <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> slogans, including [...] "Beware {{of the evil}} king Bảo Đại's preference for gambling, women, wine, milk, and butter. Those who vote for him betray their country." [...] Aside from referring to his opulent lifestyle, other slogans such as [...] "Bao Dai, puppet king selling his country", and [...] "Bao Dai, master keeper of gambling dens and brothels", referred to his alleged softness towards the communists. The radio was used to verbally abuse Bảo Đại, {{who was accused of}} treason and corruption in these broadcasts.|$|E
500|$|It {{is common}} for shuttle trains to display {{advertising}} that entirely covers the interiors and exteriors of the train, as opposed to other routes, whose stock only displays advertising on placards inside the train. Since 2008, the MTA has tested full-train advertisements on 42nd Street Shuttle rolling stock. While most advertisements are well received, a few advertisements have been controversial. Among the more contentious wraps that were withdrawn are a 2015 ad for the TV show The Man in the High Castle, which featured a Nazi flag, and an ad for the [...] "hopeless" [...] Knicks, in which a shuttle train and half of its seats were <b>plastered</b> <b>with</b> negative quotes about the city's NBA team.|$|E
