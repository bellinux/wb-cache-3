5|$|The 2015 event had a {{very similar}} format to the {{previous}} year's race. It consisted of six stages, of which five were flat stages and one was an individual time trial. The individual time trial, {{on the third day}} of racing, used <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> course as the corresponding stage in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> amount of its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.|$|E
5|$|We {{shall not}} feel that the generalization, {{unqualified}} and to be taken literally, is meant to march out of its context {{to compete with the}} scientific and philosophical generalizations which dominate our world. 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty' has <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> status, and the same justification as Shakespeare's 'Ripeness is all.' It is a speech 'in character' and supported by a dramatic context. To conclude thus may seem to weight the principle of dramatic propriety with more than it can bear. This would not be fair to the complexity of the problem of truth in art nor fair to Keats's little parable. Granted; and yet the principle of dramatic propriety may take us further than would first appear. Respect for it may at least insure our dealing with the problem of truth at the level on which it is really relevant to literature.|$|E

60|$|He {{caught the}} train at Warborne, and moved rapidly towards Bath; not <b>precisely</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> key {{as when he}} had dressed in the hut at dawn, but, as {{regarded}} the mechanical part of the journey, as unhesitatingly as before.|$|R
25|$|Sets are {{conventionally}} denoted {{with capital}} letters. Sets A and B are equal if {{and only if}} they have <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> elements.|$|E
25|$|While {{the third}} line's rhythm is unusual, {{it is not}} in itself (pace Ramsey) apocalyptic; line six of Sonnet 7 {{exhibits}} <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> rhythm under much tamer circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The last {{statement}} {{means that}} the termini of the sequences of iterations generated by the points of Fi are either <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> set, which is then a finite cycle, or they are finite cycles of circular or annular shaped sets that are lying concentrically. In the first case the cycle is attracting, in the second it is neutral.|$|E
6000|$|You {{will admit}} that these last couplets are <b>precisely</b> of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{structure}} as yours, and certainly they are octosyllabics, and made use of by Butler in an octosyllabic poem, whereas yours, to be rendered of the heroic structure, should run thus: ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{one or two}} {{attempts}} the two men got {{to swing}} their hammers so as to strike <b>precisely</b> at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> moment, and when half a dozen blows had fallen, Bertie said: [...] "It comes out a little at each blow. It is not much, but it comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Miss Annie, but not <b>precisely</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> tone {{in which}} she would have {{told him that it}} would be no trouble to read to him two or three {{chapters}} of a novel. And yet she would pass directly by the residence of Miss Harriet Corvey, the post-mistress.|$|R
25|$|If one {{reference}} frame is assigned <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time to two {{events that are}} {{at different points in}} space, a {{reference frame}} that is moving relative to the first will generally assign different times to the two events. This is illustrated in the ladder paradox, a thought experiment which uses the example of a ladder moving at high speed through a garage.|$|E
25|$|This {{last point}} is very {{difficult}} to prove. Before the Ediacaran, the biostratigraphic markers usually used to correlate rocks are absent; therefore {{there is no way to}} prove that rocks in different places across the globe were deposited at <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. The best that can be done is to estimate the age of the rocks using radiometric methods, which are rarely accurate to better than a million years or so.|$|E
25|$|If a {{conductor}} moves with a constant velocity {{through the field}} of a stationary magnet, eddy currents will be produced due to a magnetic force on the electrons in the conductor. In the rest frame of the conductor, on the other hand, the magnet will be moving and the conductor stationary. Classical electromagnetic theory predicts that <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> microscopic eddy currents will be produced, {{but they will be}} due to an electric force.|$|E
30|$|However, best {{practice}} rubrics {{are designed for}} self-reflection or peer evaluation. They are not designed to consistently and <b>precisely</b> measure <b>the</b> <b>same</b> instructional practices over separate administrations, nor are they confirmed to measure what they intend. For proper comparisons among data sets and accurate results, valid and reliable instruments should be designed to measure instructional practices in online settings.|$|R
60|$|Eustacia had {{occasionally}} {{heard the}} part recited before. When the lad ended she began, <b>precisely</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> words, and ranted on without hitch or divergence till she too reached the end. It was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing, yet how different.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I examine the {{relationships}} between social choice theory and consumer theory. First, I argue {{that they have a}} common theoretic core defined around agent’s utility maximization in choice situations. Secondly, it is claimed, as a working hypothesis, that there is a specialization relation <b>precisely</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> terms in which this relation is defined by the structuralist view...|$|R
25|$|Chikatilo is {{the prime}} suspect {{in the murder of}} 18-year-old Irina Pogoryelova, a court {{secretary}} from Bataysk who had disappeared on 11 August 1986 and whose body was found buried in the grounds of a collective farm on 18 August. Pogoryelova's body bore <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mutilations found upon victims Chikatilo killed both before and after 1986. In his initial confession, Chikatilo had denied he had killed Pogoryelova, yet later insisted at his trial he had indeed killed her.|$|E
25|$|Substitution tiling systems {{provide a}} rich source of {{aperiodic}} tilings. A set of tiles that forces a substitution structure to emerge is said to enforce the substitution structure. For example, the chair tiles shown below admit a substitution, and a portion of a substitution tiling is shown at right below. These substitution tilings are necessarily non-periodic, in <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> manner as described above, but the chair tile itself is not aperiodic—it is easy to find periodic tilings by unmarked chair tiles.|$|E
25|$|A {{recurring}} motif {{throughout the}} series is the overlapping {{of the past and}} present. For example, during Series 1: Episode 6 Sam hears the voice of his mother in 2006, telling him his life-support will be switched off at 2:00 pm. At the same time he is called into a hostage-taking situation, where the perpetrator states that he will kill his victims at <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> hour. Sam also encounters people whom he knows in the future as their younger selves, including suspects, friends, his own parents, and himself as a child.|$|E
60|$|She {{was there}} again <b>the</b> next evening, <b>precisely</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> place. Usually he walked {{home by the}} Hampstead Road. Only occasionally, when {{the beauty of the}} evening tempted him, would he take the longer way by Regent Street and through the Park. But so often it made him feel sad, the quiet Park, forcing upon him the sense of his own loneliness.|$|R
50|$|In baseball, a slide is {{the action}} of a player, acting as a baserunner, who drops his body to the ground once he {{is very close to}} the base he is {{approaching}} and slides along the ground to reach the base. Sliding is widely considered to be an essential component of baserunning in both youth and professional baseball, though not <b>precisely</b> for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> reason.|$|R
5000|$|In China the terra-cotta warriors can be recreated to be {{personalized}} for customers. The “Talented craftspeople {{use their}} hands and proper tools reproducing every masterwork <b>precisely</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> manner as <b>the</b> royal craftsmen did 2200 years ago. They are made from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> local clay as the originals and constructed essentially in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> ancient method.” [...] These warriors can {{come in a variety}} of sizes and provide a very realistic and authentic experience with their own personal warrior.|$|R
25|$|The {{habitat of}} Swainson's hawk {{consists}} of open and semi-open country – deserts, grasslands and prairies – in both its breeding and wintering ranges. It favors wild prairie, hayfields, and pastures over wheat fields and alfalfa fields, which may offer its prey too much cover. It requires elevated perches for hunting and {{a supply of}} small mammals such as young ground squirrels as prey for its nestlings. The breeding distribution of Swainson's hawk is tied very closely to the distribution of various small mammals for this reason. In Saskatchewan, for example, the distribution of Richardson's ground squirrel and Swainson's hawk are <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b>|$|E
25|$|The red {{freestone}} of the Keuper {{building stone}} is familiar in buildings and bridges throughout North and West Cheshire. It is easily quarried and yields large free standing blocks and though soft {{at the time}} of quarrying, it has quality of hardening on exposure to the weather. The building stone represents a particular lithology of medium grained massive sandstones within the Keuper Sandstone and may not always lie at <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> horizon. It seems likely that the rock quarried {{in the northern part of}} the district is the lateral equivalent in part at any rate to the conglomerates of Alderley Edge which die out northwards. There are no working quarries of any importance today, but there are many old quarries around the area.|$|E
25|$|Now, as it happened, I had {{confined}} myself {{strictly to}} the business of clearing the line, which was entrusted to me, and although I do not pretend that I considered the matter in its legal aspect at the time, the fact remains that I did not give a shot, nor was I armed when captured. I therefore claimed {{to be included in the}} same category as the civilian railway officials and men of the breakdown gang, whose declared duty it was to clear the line, pointing out that though my action might differ in degree from theirs, it was of <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> character, and that if they were regarded as non-combatants I had a right to be considered a non-combatant too.|$|E
60|$|Queen Margaret's son, the Prince of Wales, was {{now about}} {{eighteen}} years of age, {{and his mother}} placed him in command--nominally {{at the head of}} the army. Edward, on his side, assigned <b>the</b> <b>same</b> position to Richard, who was almost <b>precisely</b> of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> age with <b>the</b> Prince of Wales. Thus the great and terrible battle which ensued was fought, as it were, by two boys, cousins to each other, and neither of them out of their teens.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> devil works <b>precisely</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way. He is a {{very clever}} fellow; I have no {{acquaintance}} with him, but I respect his evident talents. Consistent truth and goodness will assuredly in the end overcome every thing; but inconsistent good can never be a match for consistent evil. Alas! I look in vain for some wise and vigorous man to sound the word Duty in the ears of this generation.|$|R
60|$|On one {{of those}} ugly nights, which we have faintly hinted at, but {{forborne}} to picture forth, the minister started from his chair. A new thought had struck him. There might be a moment's peace in it. Attiring himself with as much care {{as if it had}} been for public worship, and <b>precisely</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> manner, he stole softly down the staircase, undid the door, and issued forth.|$|R
25|$|Terrestrial lateral {{undulation}} is {{the most}} common mode of terrestrial locomotion for most snake species. In this mode, the posteriorly moving waves push against contact points in the environment, such as rocks, twigs, irregularities in the soil, etc. Each of these environmental objects, in turn, generates a reaction force directed forward and towards the midline of the snake, resulting in forward thrust while the lateral components cancel out. The speed of this movement depends upon the density of push-points in the environment, with a medium density of about 8 along the snake's length being ideal. The wave speed is <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the snake speed, and as a result, every point on the snake's body follows the path of the point ahead of it, allowing snakes to move through very dense vegetation and small openings.|$|E
25|$|He often {{referred}} to Le Sage's theory in his lectures on physics at the University of Göttingen. However, around 1796 Lichtenberg changed his views after being persuaded by the arguments of Immanuel Kant, who criticized any kind of theory that attempted to replace attraction with impulsion. Kant {{pointed out that the}} very existence of spatially extended configurations of matter, such as particles of non-zero radius, implies the existence of some sort of binding force to hold the extended parts of the particle together. Now, that force cannot be explained by the push from the gravitational particles, because those particles too must hold together in the same way. To avoid this circular reasoning, Kant asserted that there must exist a fundamental attractive force. This was <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> objection that had always been raised against the impulse doctrine of Descartes in the previous century, and had led even the followers of Descartes to abandon that aspect of his philosophy.|$|E
25|$|When using RFLP, the {{theoretical}} {{risk of a}} coincidental match is 1 in 100 billion (100,000,000,000), although the practical risk is actually 1 in 1000 because monozygotic twins are 0.2% of the human population. Moreover, the rate of laboratory error is almost certainly higher than this, and often actual laboratory procedures {{do not reflect the}} theory under which the coincidence probabilities were computed. For example, the coincidence probabilities may be calculated based on the probabilities that markers in two samples have bands in <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> location, but a laboratory worker may conclude that similar—but not precisely identical—band patterns result from identical genetic samples with some imperfection in the agarose gel. However, in this case, the laboratory worker increases the coincidence risk by expanding the criteria for declaring a match. Recent studies have quoted relatively high error rates, which may be cause for concern. In the early days of genetic fingerprinting, the necessary population data to accurately compute a match probability was sometimes unavailable. Between 1992 and 1996, arbitrary low ceilings were controversially put on match probabilities used in RFLP analysis rather than the higher theoretically computed ones. Today, RFLP has become widely disused due to the advent of more discriminating, sensitive and easier technologies.|$|E
60|$|And, having ascertained this, let him {{set himself}} to read them. Thenceforward the {{criticism}} of the building is to be conducted <b>precisely</b> on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> principles {{as that of a}} book; and it must depend on the knowledge, feeling, and not a little on the industry and perseverance of the reader, whether, even {{in the case of the}} best works, he either perceive them to be great, or feel them to be entertaining.|$|R
60|$|The {{plate of}} Margate now before us {{is nearly as}} {{complete}} a duplicate of the Southern Coast view as the previous plate is of that of Ramsgate; with this difference, that {{the position of the}} spectator is here <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> but <b>the</b> class of ship is altered, though <b>the</b> ship remains <b>precisely</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> spot. A piece of old wreck, which was rather an important object {{to the left of the}} other drawing, is here removed. The figures are employed in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> manner in both designs.|$|R
25|$|The one-millionth {{passenger}} flew on TAP on 19 June 1964, 18 {{years after}} the airline began operations. In 1966 TAP operated its first sole flight to Brazil, when a company Boeing 707 landed at Galeão Airport in Rio de Janeiro, on 17 June at 17.32 GMT. <b>Precisely</b> at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time and on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> day as <b>the</b> hydroplane Santa Cruz moored in Guanabara Bay in 1922, when Sacadura Cabral and Gago Coutinho made their historic South Atlantic crossing.
