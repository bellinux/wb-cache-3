40|$|We have {{developed}} novel probe systems for real-time PCR that provide higher specificity, greater sensitivity, and lower cost relative to dual-labeled probes. The seven DNA Detection Switch (DDS) -probe systems reported here employ two interacting polynucleotide components: a fluorescently labeled probe and a quencher antiprobe. High-fidelity detection is achieved with three DDS designs: two internal probes (internal DDS and Flip probes) and a <b>primer</b> <b>probe</b> (ZIPR probe), wherein each probe {{is combined with}} a carefully engineered, slightly mismatched, error-checking antiprobe. The antiprobe blocks off-target detection {{over a wide range}} of temperatures and facilitates multiplexing. Other designs (Universal probe, Half-Universal probe, and MacMan probe) use generic components that enable low-cost detection. Finally, single-molecule G-Force probes employ guanine-mediated fluorescent quenching by forming a hairpin between adjacent C-rich and G-rich sequences. Examples provided show how these probe technologies discriminate drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutants, Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, oncogenic EGFR deletion mutations, hepatitis B virus, influenza A/B strains, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the human VKORC 1 gene...|$|E

This quantitative {{detection system}} involves the 5 ' [...] > 3 ' nuclease activity of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase, which cleaves an internal oligonucleotide probe that has been labeled with both a fluorescent reporter dye (6 -carboxy-fluorescein [FAM]) and a quencher dye (6 -carboxytetramethyl-rhodamine [TAMRA]).

The two methods gave convergent results and allowed in each case fast determinations of ligand affinities for the enzyme. The dissociation constants (Kd) obtained from intrinsic fluorescence changes were slightly lower than those determined from the less direct competitive displacement experiments. In all cases, the enzyme displayed better recognition of the hybrid than of the unannealed oligonucleotide. The Kd values of phosphorothioate oligomers and their hybrids were lower than those of the corresponding normal oligomers and hybrids, but the difference was not as significant {{as in the case of}} the Ki constants for (dC) 28 and S(dC) 28 (Majumdar et al.

40|$|New {{therapeutic}} {{approaches for}} the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) can induce remarkable responses. Molecular remissions have been observed occasionally after high-dose chemotherapy. Thus, new improved techniques to monitor residual tumor cells on a molecular basis in CLL are warranted. For this purpose, a real-time quantitative allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) for patients with B-CLL was designed. In the present study, the PCR assay was standardized with identical cycling parameters as well as <b>primer,</b> <b>probe,</b> and MgCl 2 concentration for each patient. Ten patients were monitored with DNA samples obtained at 52 time points (median: 5. 2 per patient). The median follow-up per patient was 11. 4 months. Nine of ten patients had PCR-detectable residual tumor cells in the peripheral blood after therapy. One patient became PCR negative with a combination of fludarabine and rituximab after the end of treatment. The MRD levels in patients with detectable disease ranged from 0. 002 % to 10. 1 % after therapy. We conclude that real-time quantitative ASO-PCR can be utilized for quantitative molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) in B-CLL patients in complete remission (CR), that new effective treatment approaches such as combined chemo/immunotherapy can render CLL patients PCR negative, and that different MRD levels in PCR-positive patients were observed warranting further investigation into possible correlation with clinical outcome...|$|E
40|$|Background: Digital PCR is a {{relatively}} old concept for absolute quantification of DNA using PCR, but recent technological developments allowed its wide use. The current state of art technique for performing digital PCR is based on microdroplet technology. Direct absolute quantification relieves the necessity of standard curves and increases assay accuracy. In addition, the end point PCR set-up allows higher assay flexibility and decreases quantitative bias due to variations in PCR efficiency. In the present work, these theoretical advantages were assessed on the QX 100 droplet digital PCR (Bio-rad) on various virological markers to assess the possible use of ddPCR in HIV research. Methods: First, ddPCR was compared to a highly sensitive method of real-time PCR based quantification of cellular associated spliced and unspliced HIV RNA. Second, different methods of DNA extractions in combination with ddPCR were compared for quantification of total and episomal HIV DNA. Hereby, the maximal amount of restriction digested DNA was assessed in the ddPCR. Third, a touchdown procedure was optimized for an HIV specific <b>primer</b> <b>probe</b> set with a low melting temperature using touchdown ddPCR. Results: The comparsion of the nested real-time quantitative PCR to ddPCR indicated that ddPCR is at least equally sensitive to qPCR but also that false positive negative control samples may interfere with quantification {{at the level of}} single copies. Episomal 2 LTR quantification was compared on ddPCR between total DNA extracted DNA and plasmid purified DNA, revealing a higher accuracy of 2 LTR measurements in the total DNA extracts. Assessment of total DNA load in digital PCR reactions revealed a higher tolerance for inhibition compared to qPCR, but a strong influence of the concentration of restriction digestion mix on ddPCR efficiency. Finally, a touchdown procedure revealed that digital PCR can combine a higher flexibility in assay design while retaining accurate quantitative power compared to qPCR Conclusions: We transferred 4 assays used in HIV reservoir research to the ddPCR platform. Although ddPCR has some major advantages for low level quantification in HIV reservoir research, some technical hurdles, including the occurrence of false negative control samples need still be addressed to ameliorate the current technology...|$|E

The performance of these assays was equivalent to those of published assays and, in the case of foot and mouth disease virus and swine vesicular disease virus, to the assays currently used in the UK reference laboratories. A 5 '-conjugated minor groove binder assay and a <b>Primer</b> <b>Probe</b> Energy Transfer (PriProET) assay were developed for the differential detection, and potential genotyping of avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus. These assays were compared to TaqMan and conventional peR assays. The 5 '-conjugated minor groove binder assay did not perform as well as the TaqMan assay in terms of diagnostic sensitivy. The PriProET assay proved to be equivalent to the TaqMan assay. Both assays were capable of detecting single base changes in the viral target and could therefore potentially function as genotyping assays. The porcine circovirus type 2 5 '-conjugated minor groove binder assay was applied to the quantification of viral load in a vaccine study. The assay was capable of quantifying viral load in vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups of animals, in tissues, sera and faeces. The assay performed better in terms of efficiency than a SYBR Green I assay but would require further validation in order to establish the accuracy of quantification, particular if it was to be used for diagnosis of "histopatological" post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. A loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay was applied for the detection of avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus.

Microbial investigation of the different ANME subtypes (ANME- 1; ANME- 2 a, b, and c; and ANME- 3) was mainly done in sediments where specific subtypes of ANME were highly enriched and methanogenic cell numbers were low. In different sediments with higher archaeal diversity and abundance, it is important that <b>primers</b> and <b>probes</b> targeting different ANME subtypes are very specific and do not detect other ANME subtypes or methanogens that are also present. In this study, <b>primers</b> and <b>probes</b> that were regularly used in AOM studies were tested in silico on coverage and specificity. Most of the previously developed <b>primers</b> and <b>probes</b> were not specific for the ANME subtypes, thereby not reflecting the actual ANME population in complex samples.
