40|$|Line commutated HVDC {{systems are}} widely used due to their high power ratings. However, one of the {{disadvantages}} of such HVDC systems is the high risk of commutation failures when AC disturbances arise. These failures normally develop in the inverter station. When failed commutation occurs, the LCC HVDC system is greatly disturbed resulting in loss of power transmission. Moreover, the rapid increase in the direct current during unsuccessful commutation results in additional stresses on the thyristor valves. In an attempt to reduce the probability of unsuccessful commutation, a commutation failure prevention function {{is added to the}} HVDC system controls. When an AC system disturbance is detected, this function is activated with the aim of altering the firing order at the inverter station. Since the angle contribution from the function is independent of the minimum inverter extinction angle, this approach possesses limitations under certain AC faults. In this thesis, a commutation failure prevention function based on voltage-time area contribution was designed and implemented. Simulation results show that both the proposed and existing functions are equally ineffective in mitigating the first commutation failures when three <b>phase</b> <b>faults</b> are applied. However, the proposed function is more effective in mitigating the first commutation failure when single <b>phase</b> <b>faults</b> are applied compared to the existing function. In 17 % of the investigated cases, improvements were registered when the proposed function was utilised. Moreover, in 25 % of the cases when three <b>phase</b> <b>faults</b> were applied, the proposed function reduced the occurrence of multi-valve commutation failures...|$|R

In mine power systems, false {{operation}} and failure operation of relays in parallel supply lines often take place when single <b>phase</b> grounding <b>fault</b> occurs. A novel method based on phase-to-phase current difference is proposed as line selection criterion in this paper. The method builds on that the phase-to-phase current difference based on <b>fault</b> <b>phase</b> in <b>fault</b> line {{is equal to}} the grounding fault current while the phase-to-phase current difference based on <b>fault</b> <b>phase</b> in sound lines is equal to zero. Thus the fault line was selected by the biggest phase-to-phase current difference of the lines. The simulation results using PSCAD and experiment results show that the method has a high accuracy and a great ability of anti-disturbance. It is quite effective when single-phase-to-earth fault occurs in one of the parallel supply lines. It also applies to any distribution system with different grounding patterns and won’t be affected by the value of grounding resistance or the degree of <b>fault</b> <b>phase...</b>|$|R
