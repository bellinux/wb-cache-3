5|$|Almost {{from its}} inception, the Clal Center {{was the target}} of criticism. Some critics decried the {{decision}} to demolish the historic Alliance Vocational School in order to build the <b>project</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first place. Others pointed out that the style and height of the building were incompatible with typical low-rise Jerusalem architecture in the surrounding neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Belgrade {{was one of}} {{the last}} big European capitals and cities with over a million people to have no metro/subway or other rapid transit system.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the attitudinal influence of political administrators toward development <b>projects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Purposefully, the study assessed the attitude of political administrators towards development <b>projects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Niger Delta region; the attitudinal influence behind the successive development agencies towards development <b>projects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Niger Delta region; and the restiveness of Niger Delta region associated with the attitude of political administrators. The researcher used descriptive and survey designs {{to carry out the}} study. The respondents were eighty (80) political analysts and economist drawn from Akwa-Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross-Rivers, and Delta states. The data obtained was facilitated by administering a research questionnaire of twenty (20) items to seventy-five (75) political analysts and economists, having a response rate of 93 %. Among other things, the findings of the study revealed that there is no positive attitude of political administrators toward development <b>projects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Niger Delta region; there is attitudinal influence behind the successive development agencies toward development <b>projects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Niger Delta region; and restiveness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Niger Delta region is associated with the attitude of political administrators. In light of this, the study concluded that there is no positive attitudinal influence of political administrators toward development <b>projects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Niger Delta region of Nigeria...|$|R

5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and had to fight for every stage of the <b>project.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|Alaska senator Ernest Gruening {{remained}} a staunch backer {{of the project}} from its inception to its cancellation, {{and made it a}} major personal political priority. Gruening led a coalition of Alaska lawmakers that included most of the Alaska Legislature. In the 1962 Alaska state elections, every candidate elected to the state legislature was a supporter of the <b>project.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> years that followed, the Alaska Legislature voted several times to allocate state funding for the project. Politicians at the city level also got into the action, as the city of Anchorage and the Fairbanks Public Utilities Board each voted to contribute $10,000 to a pro-Rampart organization. Among the group's members was Ted Stevens, who was appointed in 1968 as one of Alaska's representatives to the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|Almost every fighter <b>project</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{postwar era}} {{immediately}} applied the concept, which started appearing on production fighters {{in the late}} 1940s. Avro engineers explored swept-wing and tail modifications to the CF-100 known as the CF-103, which had proceeded to wooden mock-up stage. The CF-103 offered improved transonic performance with supersonic abilities in a dive. However, the basic CF-100 continued to improve through this period, and the advantages were continually eroded. When a CF-100 broke the sound barrier on 18 December 1952, interest in the CF-103 waned.|$|E

5|$|Bell was an {{energetic}} and skilful entrepreneur {{as well as}} an innovative metallurgist. He was involved in multiple partnerships with his brothers to make iron and alkali chemicals, and with other pioneers including Robert Stirling Newall to make steel cables. He pioneered the large-scale manufacture of aluminium at his Washington works, conducting experiments in its production, and in the production of other chemicals such as the newly discovered element thallium. He was a director of major companies including the North Eastern Railway and the Forth Bridge company, then the largest bridge <b>project</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.|$|E
5|$|Carey has {{expressed}} her belief in God and her connection between music and spirituality, {{and felt the}} album was finally a way to portray her mysticism into music. After the success of Carey's previous effort, Music Box, there was speculation of a new <b>project</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> works; however {{it was not until}} October 1994, only one month before the album's release, that Billboard announced Carey would be releasing a holiday album for the Christmas season. Initially, critics were shocked; they did not know how Carey would fare as an entertainer, as she had previously only been viewed as a pop star. Nevertheless, Carey, unaffected by the speculation, continued working on, and promoting the album in high spirits, confident in her work. The idea proved to be wise, earning Carey recognition in various markets including Christian radio and contemporary R stations, as well as extended her fame in Japan, where the album experienced much of its success.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{concentrated}} {{solar power}} plants were first developed in the 1980s. The 392 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, in the Mojave Desert of California, is the largest solar power plant in the world. Other large {{concentrated solar power}} plants include the 150 MW Solnova Solar Power Station and the 100 MW Andasol solar power station, both in Spain. The 250 MW Agua Caliente Solar <b>Project,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, and the 221 MW Charanka Solar Park in India, are the world's largest photovoltaic plants. Solar projects exceeding 1 GW are being developed, {{but most of the}} deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5kW, which are connected to the grid using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff.|$|E

5|$|Despite that failure, in 1925 {{a similar}} bill passed both the House and Senate, which {{allowed for the}} {{creation}} of the National Capital Parks Commission (NCPC) to oversee the construction of a Fort Circle of parks similar to that proposed in 1919. The NCPC was authorized to begin purchasing land occupied by the old forts, much of which had been turned over to private ownership following the war. Records indicate that the site of Fort Stanton was purchased for a total of $56,000 in 1926. The duty of purchasing land and constructing the fort parks changed hands several times throughout the 1920s and 1930s, eventually culminating with the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service taking control of the <b>project</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1940s.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th century, {{there was}} {{increasing}} demand to replace or supplement the Saltash and Torpoint ferries, {{which could not}} cope with the rise in motor traffic. After the Government refused to prioritise the <b>project</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, it was self-financed by Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. Construction was undertaken by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company and began in 1959. It was unofficially opened in October 1961, with a formal presentation by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in April 1962. A reconstruction of the bridge began in 1999 after it {{was found to be}} unable to support a European Union requirement for goods vehicle weights. The work involved building two new parallel decks while the original construction was completely rebuilt. The project was completed in late 2001 and formally opened by Princess Anne in April 2002. The extra decks have remained in use, increasing the bridge's capacity.|$|E
