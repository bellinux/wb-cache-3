This reduces load on the network and increases throughput for clients on the network; however, it has the undesirable effect of delaying association and roaming processes as stations scanning for access points could potentially miss a beacon while scanning other channels. Alternatively, decreasing the beacon interval causes beacons to be sent more frequently. This increases load on the network and decreases throughput for users, but it does result in a quicker association and roaming process. An additional downside of decreasing the beacon interval is that stations in <b>power</b> <b>save</b> <b>mode</b> will consume more power as they must more frequently awake to receive beacons.|$|E

The ACQ system guarantees the neighbor discovery between each member node and the clusterhead in a cluster, and between clusterheads in the network. We show that by taxing slightly more energy consumption on the clusterhead, the average energy consumption of stations in a cluster can reduce substantially than can be achieved by traditional QPS protocols. A novel construction scheme is proposed in this work, which assembles the ACQ system in O(1) time. The constructing scheme is adaptive. Stations in a cluster can adjust their awake/sleep ratio collaboratively to strike the balance between energy efficiency and delay under various cluster conditions. Simulation results show that the ACQ system outperforms the previous studies up to 52 % in energy efficiency, while introducing no extra worst-case latency.

30|$|In our switch, {{we control}} {{operating}} modes of switches based on queue size, when queue length equals the threshold â€“Max Queue Lengh then the switch starts in processing and transmiting packets to receivers. Besides, {{the value of}} Max Queue Lengh at the Low <b>Power</b> <b>mode</b> and <b>Save</b> <b>Power</b> <b>mode</b> is set at 2000 bytes and 5120 bytes, respectively. While size of an input queue (RX Queue) is 8096 bytes that {{is larger than the}} Max Queue Lengh. On the other hand, in (Naous et al. 2008 a) presents implementation of the Openflow Switch can hold more than 32, 000 exact-match flow entries and is capable of running at line-rate across the four NetFPGA ports. Thus, when the switch is turned on, it runs at line-rate. Our method also does not drop packets compared with the normal switch.|$|R
