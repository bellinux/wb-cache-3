500|$|The New Zealand {{visual effects}} studio Weta Digital was {{initially}} selected {{to assist in}} creating a preview clip for the 2007 Comic-Con Convention. The studio's 100 employees later developed the visual effects for 300 of the 600 shots in the film. In total, {{there are more than}} 100 jumps in the film, and each jump was modified based on the distance and location the character(s) jumped. The jumps were developed using Nuke and Shake software; many, including those to Big Ben and the Sphinx were created with Maya. Weta's VFX supervisor Erik Winquist explained how the visual effects of the jumps were created: [...] "The concept of what a jump looks like changed and evolved a little over the course of post production. There are shots in the film that use still array footage but not {{in the same way that}} we saw in The Matrix. The Matrix was largely about stopping time whereas this was about using slow shutter speeds on those still array cameras to end up with a streaky motion-blurred image as the perspective was changing, which is a <b>pretty</b> <b>interesting</b> look." [...] Other visual effects studios that assisted with the film include Hydraulx, Digital Domain, and Pixel Magic. Lightwave 3D was also used for some of the movie's scenes.|$|E

[...] The ending of the relationship was [...] "painfully and unforgettably awful," [...] which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character. Weber also stated that, [...] "we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt {{that the only way to}} tell this story was to come at it from a completely real place. It was <b>pretty</b> <b>interesting</b> for us because Scott was just going through a break-up and I was in a long-term relationship, so we each brought a totally opposite perspective, living it and not living it, and I think that tension helped to bring out more of the comedy".|$|E

Outside of this yard was the usual wharfish neighborhood, with its turmoil of trucks and carts and fleet express-wagons, its building up and pulling down, its discomfort and clamor of every sort, and its shops for the sale, not only of those luxuries which Lucy had mentioned, but of such domestic refreshments as lemon-pie and hulled-corn.|$|R

60|$|A very {{peculiar}} and exceptional {{offshoot of}} the parrot group is the brush-tongued lory, several species of which are common in Australia, India, and the Molucca Islands. These <b>pretty</b> and <b>interesting</b> creatures are {{in point of fact}} parrots which have practically made themselves into humming-birds by long continuance in the poetical habit of visiting flowers for food. Like Mr. Oscar Wilde in his æsthetic days, they breakfast off a lily. Flitting about from tree to tree with great rapidity, they thrust their long extensible tongues, pencilled with honey-gathering hairs, into the tubes of many big tropical blossoms. The lories, indeed, live entirely on nectar, and they are so common in the region they have made their own that all the larger flowers there have been developed with a special view to their tastes and habits, {{as well as to the}} structure of their peculiar brush-like honey-collector. In most parrots the mouth is dry and the tongue horny; but in the lories it is moist and much more like the same organ in the humming-birds and sun-birds. The prevalence of very large and brilliantly coloured flowers in the Malayan region must be set down for the most part to the selective action of these æsthetic and colour-loving little brush-tongued parrots.|$|R

The lower end of the lake is bordered by swamps and marshes of considerable extent, but a little further on, the hills come down to the water's edge and give it very much the appearance of a greet river, the width being about two miles. At the upper end is the village of Kakas, where I dined with the head man in a good house like those I have already described; and then went on to Langówan, four miles distant over a level plain. This was the place where I had been recommended to stay, and I accordingly unpacked my baggage and made myself comfortable in the large house devoted to visitors.

Writing for BBC Music, Spencer Grady observed [...] "The resultant pieces feel so alive that you can almost sense the pressure of Frahm’s fingers alighting on each key as these solemn improvisations begin to weave their magic. Their unrefined organic energy and resonance is undoubtedly due to the natural reverb of the old church in Berlin where this set was recorded". Rock Sound reviewer Joe Marshall enthused [...] "The Bells is a consistently fascinating listen. Possessing a grandeur that never descends into pomposity and a restraint that could never be mistaken for bland aural wallpaper, this is undoubtedly {{one of the most}} beautiful releases you’re likely to hear over the coming months'. Not all critics were as generous. In his 3 star review on MusicOMH, Ben Hogwood said [...] "The Bells is a mixed bag of accomplished piano pieces that could do with a bit more subtlety in those passages where the intensity rises. It’s those softer, more intimate asides that have the greatest impact, allowing the listener to truly connect with Nils Frahm and his message. And that’s where the simple beauty of the piano shines through". In his review for Pitchfork, Brian Howe gave the album 4.8 out of 10 saying [...] "The bottom line is that The Bells tends to be either tedious and <b>pretty</b> or <b>interesting</b> and caustic; it often feels unpleasantly satisfied with itself.".|$|R
40|$|First of all, {{the result}} {{which will be}} {{presented}} here right now is actually a joint work with Naoko Kunugi and Katsushi Waki [9], which should show up as an ordinary paper in near future, hopefully. In representation theory of nite groups, especially in modular representation theory of nite groups {{there are quite a}} few problems and conjectures which are <b>pretty</b> much <b>interesting</b> and important. I believe that most of them have origins which are (were) due to Richard Brauer (1901 — 77) who should have been a unique pioneer of modular representation theory of nite groups. However, I guess most people might agree that the following conjectures should be the ones if we have to choose three of them from the problems and conjectures. Namely, Alperin’s weight conjecture (1986), Dade’s conjecture (1990) and Broué’s abelian defect group conjecture (Broué’s ADGC) (1988). In this short note we shall focus on Broué’s ADGC, particularly. Michel Broue ́ around late eighties announced the following conjecture, which is nowa-days well-known and is called Broué’s ADGC (abelian defect group conjecture). That is, Broué’s abelian defect group conjecture (ADGC) (see [2], [3], [4], [5]). Let p be a prime and let G be a nite group. Let a triple (O,K, k) be a p-modular system, namely, O is a complete discrete valuation ring of rank one, K is the quotient eld of O with characteristic zero, and k is the residue eld O/rad(O) with characteristic p. We assume moreover that the p-modular system (O,K, k) is big enough for all subgroups ofG, namely, K and k are both splitting elds for all subgroups of G. Now, let A be a block algebra of the group algebra OG with defect group P, and set H = NG(P), the normalizer of P in G. Let B be a block algebra of OH which is the Brauer correspondent of A, and hence B has the same defect group P. If the defect group P of A is abelian (commutative), then the algebras A and B should be derived (Rickard) equivalent, namely...|$|R

Then I do rather have good salt-water baths, and see glorious sunsets and sunrises, and star-light nights, and the great many-voiced ocean, the winds and waves chiming all night with a solemn sound, lapping against my ear as I lie in my canvas bed, six feet by two and a half, and fall sound asleep and dream of home. Oh! there is much that is really enjoyable in this kind of life; and if the cares of the vessel, management of men, &c., do harass me sometimes, it is very good for me; security from such troubles having been anxiously and selfishly pursued by me at home.|$|R

For, from the beginning of this book to this page of it, I have never praised Turner highly for any other cause than that he gave facts more delicately, more Pre-Raphaelitically, than other men. Careless readers, who dashed at the descriptions and missed the arguments, took up their own conceptions of the cause of my liking Turner, and said to themselves: [...] "Turner cannot draw, Turner is generalizing, vague, visionary; and the Pre-Raphaelites are hard and distinct. How can any one like both?"[46] But I never said that Turner could not draw. I never said that he was vague or visionary. What I said was, that nobody had ever drawn so well: that nobody was so certain, so un-visionary; that nobody had ever given so many hard and downright facts. Glance back to the first volume, and note the expressions now. [...] "He is the only painter who ever drew a mountain or a stone;[47] the only painter who can draw the stem of a tree; the only painter who has ever drawn the sky, previous artists having only drawn it typically or partially, but he absolutely and universally." [...] Note how he is praised in his rock drawing for [...] "not selecting a <b>pretty</b> or <b>interesting</b> morsel here or there, but giving the whole truth, with all the relations of its parts."[48] Observe how the great virtue of the landscape of Cima da Conegliano and the early sacred painters is said to be giving [...] "entire, exquisite, humble, realization--a strawberry-plant in the foreground with a blossom, and a berry just set, and one half ripe, and one ripe, all patiently and innocently painted from the real thing, and therefore most divine." [...] Then re-read the following paragraph (§ 10.), carefully, and note its conclusion, that the thoroughly great men are those who have done everything thoroughly, and who have never despised anything, however small, of God's making; with the instance given of Wordsworth's daisy casting its shadow on a stone; and the following sentence, [...] "Our painters must come to this before they have done their duty." [...] And yet, when our painters did come to this, did do their duty, and did paint the daisy with its shadow (this passage having been written years before Pre-Raphaelitism was thought of), people wondered how I could possibly like what was neither more nor less than the precise fulfilment of my own most earnest exhortations and highest hopes.|$|R
