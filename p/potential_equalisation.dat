50|$|The IEC 60601-1 {{standard}} {{requires that}} two independent precautionary measures (Means of Patient Protection, or MOPPs) {{are set in}} place, to protect the patient from electrical shock in the medical system. A network isolator can be constructed to provide one or both required MOPPs. In the case where only a single MOPP is present in a system, a second measure of protection for the medical device must be made. This can be achieved, for example, by installing a fixed, low-resistance earthing cable, bar, or strap, {{referred to as a}} <b>potential</b> <b>equalisation</b> conductor. Conformation to the requirements of applicable standards and guidelines, in particular the IEC 60601-1 standard, involves manufacturers themselves declaring CE compliance and/or gaining certification from an approved independent testing laboratory.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to {{investigate}} the behaviour of coarse and fine colliery discards with respect to liquefaction potential, using controlled load triaxial testing. It was hoped to relate the behaviour in these tests to measured material properties such as strength, shape, chemistry and mineralogy. The investigation of coarse discards contrasted the behaviour of a weak, seatearth-rich discard from Gedling Colliery with that of a strong shale-rich discard from Abernant Colliery. The former showed some liquefaction potential at low confining pressures, while the latter showed no liquefaction potential. A seatearth and a shale from County Durham were used to demonstrate say possible links between these basic materials and the behaviours observed. However, both showed responses similar to the Gedling discard. Investigation of material properties indicated that the strength of material, its stability in water and its facility for pore pressure equalisation were the most important factors influencing response during controlled load testing. The strength and stability of the material are probably related to its organic carbon content. The Abernant discard had a high strength and stability in water and showed good <b>potential</b> for <b>equalisation</b> of pore pressures during testing, in contrast to the other three materials. Tests on mixtures of Abernant discard and the Durham seatearth showed a transition between the behaviours of the end materials for a mixture containing between 20 and 25 per cent seatearth. Tests on fine discard from Peckfield Colliery showed significant differences in behaviour between samples from the lagoon and those fabricated in the laboratory. The former showed strong dilatant behaviour, while the latter showed some potential for liquefaction. This is probably due to differences in soil structure (organisation of particles). Tests on fine discard from Abernant showed a high potential for liquefaction. The most significant difference, possibly affecting liquefaction potential, between this discard and that from Peckfield was the uniformity of grading, the Abernant discard being considerably more uniform. The results for the Abernant fine discard showed no correlation with those for the coarse discard from the same colliery...|$|R
40|$|One {{possible}} way of implementing the TV telephone system is by transmitting the video signal over existing telephone cables. Not {{only is this}} attractive from an economical standpoint, it {{also appears to be}} technically reasonable. However, there are certain basic problems to be considered, particularly in reference to baseband analogue transmission over the local subscriber area. For a start, it is expected that fixed equalisers will be required at regular intervals along the line to compensate for attenuation losses. These equalisers will have to be designed on the basis of some average channel characteristic. As a result, there will be uncorrected losses owing to deviations from the average characteristic for the different TV telephone connections. These and other channel imperfections will have to be compensated automatically. This thesis is concerned with the design and testing of an automatic equaliser to serve the above-mentioned purpose. Chapter One outlines the basic principles of operation, together with the performance criterion used to assess the degree of optimality achieved. The mode of operation is discussed, as well as the different possible choices and arrangements of the basic equaliser function. To provide further insight into the process, a mathematical study is given in Chapter Two. This includes considering the control algorithm for tap adjustments, the conditions for convergence, and the choice of step size to be used. The analysis is extended to cover adaptive operations, where the information for updating the tap settings is not exactly available but must be estimated on-line. In addition, ways of improving performance through modifying the basic equaliser structure (such as using a feedback configuration instead of the conventional feedforward arrangement) are also considered. The theoretical investigation is carried further in Chapter Three. The effect of noise on equaliser capability and performance is discussed, along with the need for a defined standard of signal-to-noise ratio for acceptable transmission. This is followed by an evaluation of the effect of having a non-linearity in the feedback loop. The resulting system is studied, using some form of linearised analysis. Some reference to stability requirements is also given. In order to confirm some of the theoretical findings of the previous chapters, and to demonstrate the <b>potential</b> of automatic <b>equalisation</b> in practice, a real-time experimental system was designed and assembled. Chapter Four outlines the work involved and the problems encountered. The choice of suitable test signals and their method of generation are discussed in some detail. After the experimental equaliser had been built, various tests were conducted, using 500 yards of 4 lb P. I. U. T. cable to represent the TV telephone channel. The tests were designed to provide an estimate of some of the critical parameters and an assessment of system capability. The nature of the tests, with the results obtained, are given in Chapter Five. The implications of the test results are discussed in Chapter Six. The areas requiring further investigation are identified. A preliminary discussion of the problems involved in integrating the system into the existing telephone network is also included. The conclusion summarises the state of progress in evaluating the practicability of the automatic mean square equaliser for TV telephone applications...|$|R
