40|$|Preventive {{detention}} laws authorize {{courts to}} order the continued detention in prison {{of a person who}} has served their allocated term of imprisonment, but who are thought to be at risk of re-offending if released. They raise fundamental issues about the separation of powers, the purpose of incarceration, and the standard of proof which is/should be required to authorize detention. They assume {{that it is possible to}} predict, with a satisfactory rate of success, whether or not a <b>past</b> <b>offender</b> would if released commit further offences.

40|$|Abstract Objectives: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between residential change and a woman’s subsequent risk of intimate partner violence (IPV), whether by a past or a new offender, a relationship that has not been prospectively examined to date. Design: A dynamic cohort of women who recently changed residence (movers) was compared with those who did not (non-movers) for 12 -month risk of IPV by a <b>past</b> <b>offender</b> and of IPV by a new offender. Participants and methods: Secondary analysis of a linked, longitudinal National Crime Victimization Survey dataset including 10 754 recent movers and 10 236 non-movers among women aged 18 – 44 years. Results: The risk of IPV by either a past or a new offender was almost double for women who had recently moved compared with those who had not moved. This increased risk proved to be robust, as it persisted when the data were weighted and unweighted, and when the main effect was adjusted by measured covariates. Conclusions: The apparent increase in IPV risk after residential change may be a marker of a pre-existing problem or a precursor of subsequent problems. Unlike past research that has considered residential change after abuse or as a simultaneous exposure, this study focused solely on empirically measuring the risk of IPV after a recent move. This decision has important public health ramifications: determination of IPV exposure is not always possible, whereas soliciting a woman’s history of residence may be more feasible. If transience puts a woman at greater risk for victimisation by an intimate partner, increased awareness may have a vital role in protecting women who move...|$|E

50|$|Operation Bumblebee {{was first}} {{introduced}} to north London in 1991, and was rolled out across {{the rest of the}} capital in June 1993.

Another aspect of the operation was the roadshows held regularly throughout London, at which millions of pounds' worth of recovered stolen goods would be put on display, allowing victims of theft to identify and claim their belongings.|$|R

Assertions by the police that the crime had been a case of opportunistic abduction from the home by a stranger were initially met with scepticism, given the seemingly unbelievable nature of the crime.

40|$|The newly {{established}} International Criminal Court (ICC) promises {{justice to the}} victims of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. <b>Past</b> <b>offenders</b> can be punished, while future potential offenders may be deterred by the prospect of punishment. Yet, justice is no substitute for intervention for the benefit of people at acute risk of being victimized. The Court may create a new moral hazard problem if the promise of ex post justice makes it easier for states to shy away from incurring the costs of intervention. This article indirectly tests for the relevance of this potential problem by estimating the determinants of ratification delay to the Rome Statute of the ICC. I find that countries, which in the past have been more willing to intervene in foreign civil wars and more willing to contribute troops to multinational peacekeeping missions {{are more likely to have}} ratified the Statute (early on). This suggests that the Court is a complement to, not a substitute for intervention...|$|R
5000|$|In November 2011, the Miami Herald {{reported}} {{on the fate of}} the former Julia Tuttle Causeway colony, which former residents nicknamed [...] "Bookville". Analysts studying the colony unanimously agreed on two relevant issues: the inability to find a stable home for offenders increased the risk that they would re-offend, and the close proximity of offenders to schools or parks did not increase the possibility that <b>past</b> <b>offenders</b> would re-offend. Despite these findings, Book solicited for and applied federal stimulus money to buy short-term stays for offenders, eventually costing US$1,000 a month which, as noted by the Herald, would have been unnecessary without the more stringent law that Book championed. This is incorrect according to David Raymond, {{former executive director of the}} Homeless Trust: federal Stimulus funds were never utilized for this population in Miami-Dade County; the funds used were from the local Homeless Food & Beverage Tax. Rent subsidies, along with job placement services and case management, were provided for up to six months.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to show the {{significance}} of correctional programs and services and their correlation to the reduction in recidivism rates among incarcerated persons. This study will be examining the success rate of specific programs, both court appointed and those that are voluntary, through the process of surveying participants as well as administrative staff. The participants will include current and former members. Included with surveying, interviews will be conducted, either in person or via telephone, to current and former inmates, administrative staff at specific correctional facilities, and leaders of programs and services provided to offenders. These contacts will be made through the DeKalb County Jail, the DeKalb County Probation Department, the Indiana State Prison, and other facilities if need be. This study theorizes that counseling services and other similar programs are helping to lower prison populations and decrease recidivism rates which, in turn, transform these <b>past</b> <b>offenders</b> into law-abiding citizens. We tgare finding that particular services offered to offenders can prevent one from recidivating, which is worthy of examining and implementing into more prisons and jails across the nation...|$|R
50|$|In Edda, no one may marry by inheritance, {{and members}} of the patrilineage are {{forbidden}} from marrying or taking over a woman formerly married to one of their fold. Therefore, a divorcee or widow must of necessity remarry outside the agnatic circle of her former husband. If this custom is flouted, it becomes incestuous and the gods have to be appeased.

50|$|An amnesty may be {{extended}} when the authority decides that bringing citizens into compliance with a law {{is more important}} than punishing them for past offenses. Amnesty after a war helps end a conflict. While laws against treason, sedition, etc. are retained to discourage future traitors during future conflicts, it makes sense to forgive <b>past</b> <b>offenders,</b> after the enemy no longer exists which had attracted their support but a significant number remains in flight from authorities. Amnesty is often used to get people to turn in contraband, {{as in the case of}} China's gun restrictions, or the Kansas City ban on pit bulls.Advantages of using amnesty may include avoiding expensive prosecutions (especially when massive numbers of violators are involved); prompting violators to come forward who might otherwise have eluded authorities; and promoting reconciliation between offenders and society. An example of the latter was the amnesty that was granted to conscientious objectors and draft dodgers in the wake of the Vietnam War in the 1970s, in an effort by President Carter to heal war wounds, given that both the war and the draft were over.|$|R
40|$|Community {{notification}} laws, {{designed to}} reduce the frequency of sex offenses by alerting potential victims to nearby threats and by encouraging citizen monitoring of potential recidivists, may make sense {{in the context of}} traditional sex offenses and sex offenders. But child pornography crimes and the individuals who commit them are different, and they differ from archetypal sex crimes and criminals in ways that may unintentionally cause community notification laws to facilitate crime rather than inhibit it. Child porn offenses typically involve money or trade, and their commission hinges on successfully conspiring with others. Markets and information are necessary building blocks for this sort of criminal behavior. Child porn offenders must find each other to make crime pay. As a result, announcing the identity of <b>past</b> <b>offenders</b> may perversely make child pornography and its associated harms more, not less, of a problem. Lawmakers, therefore, should reconsider the blanket application of community notification requirements to child porn offenders. Shrinking the child porn market and its associated abuse of minors may be easier if the law subjects fewer child porn offenders to community notification requirements. For the same reason, when sentencing child porn distributors and possessors, judges should not assume that community notification can provide an effective substitute for the incapacitation benefits typically associated with incarceration...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four empirical essays. The first essay evaluates the impact on crime of a large scale experimental scheme in which all state monopoly alcohol stores in selected Swedish counties kept open on Saturdays. We show that the experiment significantly raised both alcohol sales and crime. The effect is confined to Saturdays and tentative evidence indicates a displacement of crime from weekdays to Saturdays. The experiment had no significant impact on crime over the entire week. The second essay examines the effect of income inequality on health for newly arrived refugees. The results reveal no statistically significant effect of income inequality on {{the risk of being}} hospitalized. This finding holds for most population subgroups and when separating between different types of diagnoses. The conclusions do not change when we consider long-term exposure to inequality. Our estimates are precise enough to rule out large effects of income inequality on health. The third essay examines the effect of relative income differences on criminal behavior. There is a positive effect on the propensity to commit property crime. The effect is small and mainly driven by <b>past</b> <b>offenders,</b> low educated and young individuals. I only find weak evidence that relative income differences increases the likelihood to commit violent crime. The empirical analysis further reveals that differences in gross labor earnings are more strongly related to crime than disparities in disposable income. The fourth essay describes the patterns of intergenerational transmission of education among immigrant mothers and their daughters. The results show that the persistence is slightly lower among immigrants compared to natives, and that the relationship is weaker among those who start out disadvantaged. I find large variations across different immigrant groups, but these differences are partly {{explained by the fact that}} groups belong to different parts of the educational distribution...|$|R

Still she bore it; she fanned herself with an indignant air, but still she bore it. A comic song was sung, involving a confession from some imaginary gentleman that he had kissed a female, and yet the formal lady bore it. But when at last, the health of the godfather before-mentioned being drunk, the godfather rose to return thanks, {{and in the course of}} his observations darkly hinted at babies yet unborn, and even contemplated the possibility of the subject of that festival having brothers and sisters, the formal lady could endure no more, but, bowing slightly round, and sweeping haughtily <b>past</b> the <b>offender,</b> left the room in tears, under the protection of the formal gentleman.|$|R

The emphasis throughout the questioning is on identifying information that is relevant for understanding the defendant's offense conduct and present situation. During the interview, the probation officer will ask the offender to sign authorizations to release confidential information.

40|$|Trends in police-recorded and (where they exist) {{household}} survey-measured cybercrimes {{for economic}} gain are reviewed {{in a range}} of developed countries – Australia, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK and the US - and their implications for criminal policy are considered. The datasets indicate a substantial rise in online fraud – though one that is lower than the rise in online shopping and other ‘routine activity’ indicators - but it is not obvious whether this is just displacement for the fall in household and automobile property crime, nor how much overlap there is between the <b>offenders</b> and <b>past</b> ‘offline’ <b>offenders.</b> Nor do the data indicate whether the frauds result from insiders or outsiders, or are collusive. The direct and indirect costs of cyberfrauds are examined, and it is concluded that there is no satisfactory basis for the larger estimates of cost, but it is undeniable that those costs are large enough to merit concern. There remains a problem of what metrics are appropriate for judging the threat and harm from cybercrimes, and their impact on national and human security. There is not a sharp division between these larger national security issues and cyber attacks on banks, businesses, and the spear phishing of individuals with important knowledge of system vulnerabilities in the public or the private sector.

40|$|Language Models are {{successfully}} {{applied to}} the problem of analysing crime descriptions from a police database with the purpose of prioritising suspects for an unsolved crime, given details of solved crimes.

Language Modelling yields a probability of a document being relevant, which in this case is interpreted as the probability of a suspect being the culprit. Although the absolute value of the probability does not carry any direct applied implications, the study does show that the general likelihood of identification of the actual suspect does correspond to the relative values. Thus these probabilities can be used for more than just ranking suspects...|$|R
40|$|Magister Psychologiae - MPsychThe high {{statistics}} of rape in South Africa {{and the increasing}} percentage of sexual offenders in correctional services beseech urgent intervention with this population. Very {{little is known about}} the clinical reasoning that informs the planning of treatments for sexual offenders by the health professionals that work with them. In particular, research is needed on what health professionals perceive to be the curative factors in the treatment of sexual offenders. This study explores and describes health professionals’ views on the treatment of sexual offenders. The research is qualitative and exploratory in nature. The sample size consisted of seven health professionals including five social workers and two clinical psychologists who work or have worked specifically with sexual crimes. Permission to conduct the study was obtained from the Senate Research Committee of UWC (Ethics Clearance and Project Registration Number: 13 / 4 / 20) and all principles of ethics e. g. voluntary participation, confidentiality, anonymity and informed consent, were upheld. Data was collected through in-depth individual interviews. Interviews were transcribed and analysed by two researchers using thematic analysis. Data collection and analysis took place in parallel until saturation was reached. Trustworthiness of the findings was achieved through inter-rater comparison, respondent validation, debriefing and reflexivity. Findings revealed that sexual offender treatment needs to account for the heterogeneity of the population and that treatment providers need providers need to be open and flexible. Treating clinicians must also be prepared to draw on a range of theories to meet the unique needs of each offender.

40|$|The Security Rating and Inmate Risk Assessments, two {{instruments}} used in correctional {{institutions in}} Newfoundland and Labrador, were examined {{for their ability}} to predict recidivism. The Security Rating Assessment is primarily composed of items related to an <b>offender's</b> <b>past</b> and present criminal behaviour. In contrast, the Inmate Risk Assessment is composed of "need" items: items that deal with the type and severity of social, emotional, and economic problems experienced by an offender. Recidivism was defined as reincarceration and both a dichotomous criterion, recidivist vs. non-recidivist, and a continuous criterion, number of violation-free days, were used. Three institutions with different male inmate populations were separately examined to determine {{the reliability and validity of}} the two instruments. The correlations obtained at the three institutions were coverted to z-scores and tests of differences were conducted. In cases where significant differences were not found, a single correlation was calculated using the combined samples. The recidivism rate for all the institutions combined was 18. 57 % with a low of 11. 74 % and a high of 29. 21 %. Both assessments were found to be reliable as shown by the intercorrelations and Cronbach's alpha. In general, the assessments were also found to be valid as shown by the criterion-to-total score correlations. Also, the recidivism rates correlated positively with the different security and risk levels as measured by the Security Rating and Inmate Risk Assessments. Specifically, more medium-security inmates than minimum-security inmates were recidivists. As well, low-risk inmates were less likely to recidivate than medium or high-risk inmates. The Inmate Risk Assessment could not discriminate between the medium and high-risk categories. In conclusion, more accurate predictions of recidivism can be made by using the Security Rating and Inmate Risk Assessments...|$|R
40|$|In the United States between 1991 and 2001, {{there was}} an {{increase}} of over 848 % in new AIDS cases in African American women fifty and older. This increase {{is due in part to}} changes in reporting. Because of the startling statistics and scarcity of studies in this population, this study examines the HIV prevention needs of two groups of African American women over fifty, injection drug users and non injection drug users. Focus groups were used to collect data on general HIV knowledge, experience with HIV prevention, psychosocial factors, drug involvement, and risks and barriers to HIV infection and prevention. Data was also collected through a survey that gathered information on demographics, sources of HIV information, HIV testing and risks including knowledge of risk, belief of risk and risk behaviors. This study found that lack of education and misconceptions regarding disease transmission act as a barrier for prevention efforts; a need for inclusive HIV prevention efforts such as multi-generational in-home programs, multi-family programs and the incorporation of prevention messages with existing health services; a need for skills building, condom negotiation skills and self-empowerment. Effective methods suggested were techniques that align with African American culture and heritage such as storytelling, inclusion of family and community. In order to generalize findings from this study, future research must include a representative sample of African American women 50 years and older such as churchgoers, sorority women, health conscious women, ex <b>offenders,</b> <b>past</b> injection drug users, infected or affected women and newly single women. The findings of this study are significant to public health research because they add to a growing body of knowledge regarding the HIV prevention needs of this group, can be used to design prevention messages for the population from which they were gathered, and most importantly provide insight to what a subpopulation of this group views as effective prevention methods. Recommendations for future research are also provided for federal government agencies, state public health agencies, community organizations, the family structure, HIV service groups, physicians, universities and researchers...|$|R
40|$|This report {{finds that}} many {{offenders}} {{are not being}} held accountable for their fines, there is little deterrent for failing to pay fines, and road safety is being compromised. Executive summaryIn 2011 - 12, 4. 79 million infringement notices and 1. 518 million warrants were issued in relation to offences committed {{in the state of}} Victoria relating to road safety and traffic, public order, industry regulation and environment protection. Road safety offences, such as speeding, drink driving and traffic light offences, were the highest category of offences. Infringement Management and Enforcement Services (IMES) of which the Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Office is a unit, is responsible for the enforcement of unpaid infringement notices and warrants 1. However IMES is not keeping up with the number of warrants issued each year so a large percentage of warrants are not enforced and expire without payment. Since 2005, approximately two million warrants worth 886 million have been 2 ̆ 7 written-off 2 ̆ 7 {{as a result of the}} Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Office being unable to effectively enforce the number of warrants issued. During the same period IMES has only cleared 185 million cash for warrants which includes cash collected by Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Officers. For each warrant finalised by the Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Office five more are issued. This has resulted in a pool of 3. 5 million warrants, valued at more than 1. 2 billion currently unexecuted and in a large percentage of cases, will not be executed before they expire after five years. IMES 2 ̆ 7 incapacity to respond to the large numbers of warrants being issued is not a new issue and has been raised in a number of reports, including:In 1996 the Auditor-General reported that the value of uncollected fines and debts was continuing to rise 2. In 1997 the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee made recommendations to improve the fines collection system. In 1998 and 2003 - 04 the Auditor-General again raised concerns about uncollected fines. In 2005 the Auditor-General examined the Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness in actioning and clearing warrants 3. In 2005 in my Own motion investigation into VicRoads registration practices I commented on uncollected fines and the impact of out-of-date address information on enforcement. In 2005 the Victorian Law Reform Commission noted concerns about the Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s execution of warrants and enforcement action against recalcitrant offenders. In 2006 the Victorian Government introduced the Infringements Act 2006 providing new sanctions for the Sheriff to deal with those who fail to pay fines or comply with court orders. A 2007 review of IMES Debt Management by PricewaterhouseCoopers noted that in 2000 IMES 2 ̆ 7 gross debt was 280 million and by 2007 had increased to 640 million. Despite these reports and recommendations, the number of unenforced warrants and debt to the state 2 ̆ 7 written-off 2 ̆ 7 continues to rise. In November 2011, the Victorian Attorney-General approved a program of works for fines reforms to the legislative framework that IMES operates under and the powers and sanctions available to the Sheriff. Some of the issues I have identified will be addressed by these reforms. However, IMES only commenced work on its proposed reforms in 2011 and the reforms are yet to be legislated and implemented. The reforms I refer to in my report should be prioritised by the government and where appropriate, implemented. IMES also needs to:consider increasing Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Officer numbers develop efficient processes and proceduresuse available powers where appropriate. At interview the Sheriff, Mr Brendan Facey (who is also Director of IMES), said that prior to his commencement as the Victorian Sheriff in October 2011 there had been issues with unenforced warrants. He said there had been 2 ̆ 7 an enormous program of things intended for years and years 2 ̆ 7. While in the <b>past</b> <b>offenders</b> have taken advantage of the inability of the Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Office to enforce large numbers of warrants, when the reforms proposed by IMES are implemented together with my recommendations, IMES should be able to hold offenders accountable in the future. Factors affecting enforcement of warrantsThere are a number of factors that have contributed to the inability of the Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Office to enforce such a large number of warrants including:Limited resources There are 172 Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Officers to enforce warrants. If the number of unenforced warrants to be executed were shared equally amongst the Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Officers then this would average 20, 400 each, an impossible task. Out-dated Information Technology The Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Office 2 ̆ 7 s IT system is 15 years old, has a number of deficiencies and is not compatible with a range of enforcement activities available to the Sheriff. Powers not utilised Since 2006 the Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Office has had enforcement powers that it has not utilised that have proven successful in other jurisdictions. For example, the garnisheeing of wages and charging and selling of land and assets. Despite having the power to make company directors liable for debts incurred by their companies since 2006, the Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Office has not used the power to any significant extent. Problems with data sharing and reliability In the past, the Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Office has relied heavily on address data held by VicRoads. It was not able to record alternative address data it obtained for offenders in its own database nor would VicRoads, until my investigation, update its database based on information received from the Sheriff. There have been some issues with agencies, including VicRoads and the Victorian Electoral Commission, about sharing address details with the Sheriff. In response to my investigation both VicRoads and the Victorian Electoral Commission have said they are prepared to assist the Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Office with address data within the constraints of their legislation. Poor enforcement strategies IMES has no documented and systematic methodology for targeting, selecting and enforcing infringement warrants. Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Officers do not prioritise warrants but are driven by location and convenience, based on their own location and the addresses of offenders. There is neither guidance from supervisors nor any IMES policy. RecommendationsI have made a number of recommendations to address expiring and unenforced warrants, including:The Government consider implementing the Fines Reform program as a priority. The Department of Justice provide more detailed annual reporting regarding warrants that are outstanding, issued, finalised, cleared and expired. IMES seek funding for additional Sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s Officers. IMES introduce a comprehensive operating methodology for actioning warrants across all regions. IMES utilise all legislative sanctions available to it in appropriate cases. IMES revisit and extend its data matching activities...|$|R
40|$|How can {{a person}} judge another individual’s moral character? One way {{may be to}} look to their moral and immoral actions. However, should all actions be weighed equally, whether they {{occurred}} in the near or distant past? Moral actions do not occur in a temporal vacuum, yet relatively little research has examined the role of time in moral judgment. We expected that people would weigh a previous immoral act differently depending on when it occurred and on their beliefs about personal malleability. Individuals differ in their implicit theories about {{the degree to which}} human characteristics, such as moral character or personality, are malleable (Dweck, Chiu, 2 ̆ 6 Hong, 1995). Entity theorists believe that personal characteristics remain stable and fixed throughout one’s life, while incremental theorists believe that these characteristics can change over time. We predicted that incremental theorists would attenuate harsh moral judgments to a greater degree with the passage of time. We also expected that motivated reasoning could influence moral judgments, and examined this by varying race of the offender and assessing prejudice levels. Three studies were designed to examine how implicit theories about personal mutability, time, and offender race affect moral judgments. Participants read about an <b>offender’s</b> <b>past</b> commission of a crime. In Study 1, incremental theorists were more forgiving of the offender and held less punitive beliefs regardless of time (3 or 10 years ago), and that modern racism predicted negative reactions to offenders perceived as Black (but not White), greater subjective recency, and a tendency to shift to a more entity perspective. Study 2 attempted to manipulate offender race, but was unable to do so effectively. In Study 3, offenders who committed crimes in the distant past (3 and 10 years) were judged more positively than those from the recent past (a few months ago), and preliminary evidence that incremental theorists are more positive towards the offender than entity theorists in the distant (but not recent) condition. After using a more overt race manipulation, however, modern racism did not systematically predict judgments about a Black offender, nor did it predict shifts in implicit theories...|$|R
