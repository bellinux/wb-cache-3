5|$|By his own {{description}} of his early family life, Cody grew up poor. His mother worked two jobs, as a traveling nurse and a bus driver, to care {{for him and his}} seven younger siblings. His <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> married, but his father, a construction worker, {{was a big part of}} his life until he died in a car accident when Cody was 11. At the end of his junior year of high school, Cody moved in with the family of a high school teammate.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{was seven}} years old when his {{grandfather}} was elected U.S. president, but he did not attend the inauguration. Although Harrison's family was distinguished, his <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> wealthy. John Scott Harrison, a two-term U.S. congressman from Ohio, spent much of his farm income on his children's education. Despite the family's modest resources, Harrison's boyhood was enjoyable, much of it spent outdoors fishing or hunting.|$|E
5|$|Kurosaki {{originally}} {{became interested}} in becoming a performer during her elementary years. During this time, she {{wanted to become a}} theater artist, and she participated in an audition in her school during her sixth grade. She did not pass the audition as she lacked talent in performing, but her singing was praised. This event would leave an impression on her, and as her <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> interested in her taking up performance arts, she decided that she wanted to become a singer.|$|E

5|$|The clause's meaning {{with regard}} to a child of legal {{immigrants}} was tested in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898). The Supreme Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, a man born within the United States to Chinese citizens who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying on business in the United States—and whose <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power—was {{a citizen of the}} United States. Subsequent decisions have applied the principle to the children of foreign nationals of non-Chinese descent.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> allowed to be present during the interview. Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E
5|$|At the {{university}} Goldstone {{became involved in}} the international effort to end South Africa's apartheid system. He had been brought up in an anti-apartheid atmosphere; although his <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> activists, they were opposed to racial discrimination and this was to have a profound influence on his later career. Like many other South African Jews, he chose to become conspicuously active in public life in an effort to oppose or alleviate the worst aspects of apartheid. While he was chairman of {{the university}}'s Students' Representative Council, he campaigned against the exclusion of black students. He also attracted attention from the state security police by having contact with anti-apartheid groups within South Africa, including the African National Congress, which was a banned organisation at the time. On one occasion he secretly tape-recorded a spy sent by the police to infiltrate the anti-apartheid student movement at the university. The recording was later used as evidence in the firing of the national police commissioner.|$|E

Dmitri told Felix he was also interested in marrying Irina, but Irina said she preferred Felix. Felix was able to persuade Irina's reluctant family to relent and allow the ceremony to go forward.|$|E

Later, at the peak of her career, Rekha told a magazine interviewer that her father's neglect still rankled and that she had ignored his efforts at reconciliation. At the age of 13, Rekha quit school to start a career in acting. She did not have any personal aspirations in this direction, but the troubled financial state of her family compelled her to do so.|$|E
