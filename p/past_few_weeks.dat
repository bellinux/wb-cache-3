[...] Alex Rocha of TV Guide was much more critical stating, [...] "it seemed that the show has taken a slight fall back.

500|$|The {{character}} development of Santana and her interactions with Finn were well received by critics. Poniewozik stated that Santana confronting her sexuality {{was one of}} the highlights of [...] "Mash Off". Wightman commented that despite Santana's callous personality, [...] "watching her burst into tears and sob that she hasn't even told her parents about her sexuality yet [...] heartbreaking". Robert Canning of IGN wrote, [...] "The biggest development was the unexpected way Santana's sexuality became public. It was a nice way to end things, building tension towards hopefully more resonating episodes to come." [...] VanDerWerff said that [...] "the last five minutes of this episode are phenomenal, one of those times that the show gets the mix of tones just right and something that's vaguely comedic gets more and more horrifying and dramatic, and then we plunge down the rabbit hole and everything goes nuts." [...] To Ryan Gajewski of Wetpaint, the scene that concluded [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "fascinating twist, and one that makes it hard to choose sides".

[...] After not making the Olympics in 2008, he met Doug Banister who challenged Tarwater to re-examine his worldview. [...] "The 'A-ha' moments were many," [...] Tarwater later recalled. [...] "y the time I had the ability to prayerfully repent and rebuke the stuff in my life, I was finally at a good time in life.... I would say I recommitted my life because I grew up in a Christian home, but really {{it was the first time}} where I knew what I was doing and committed my life to Christ."

500|$|In January, {{the club}} had seven {{scheduled}} matches, {{four in the}} Primeira Liga and three for the League Cup. They opened with an away game against Trofense, their first league loss. Reguila scored first for Trofense, with Hélder Barbosa adding a confirmation goal in the 82nd minute. The loss cost Benfica first place, and they trailed Porto by one point. Quique Flores said, [...] "We played very poorly, weak in all aspects, especially offensively". Benfica rebounded with an away win in Guimarães in the first match day of the Taça da Liga. Katsouranis headed in the first goal in the ninth minute, and Carlos Martins added a second goal in the 82nd minute. On 11 January, Benfica defeated Braga at the Estádio da Luz. At half-time, David Luiz headed in a controversial winner, and Sánchez Flores said that the club were on course to regain their confidence after a poor <b>past</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> They won their third match in a row on 14 January, defeating Olhanense 4–1 for the League Cup. Dí Maria scored the final goal in an individual effort dedicated to Diego Maradona, who was present. On 17 January, Benfica confirmed {{a place in the}} semi-finals of the League Cup with a one-nil win against Belenenses. The goal was scored by Katsouranis, assisted by Di María. The following Friday, Benfica faced Beleneses {{for the second time in}} a week. They had less success, losing two points in a goalless draw. Sánchez Flores said that Benfica could have won, and the draw was a poor result. The club ended the month with a home win against Rio Ave. Mantorras scored the only goal in the 70th minute, three minutes after entering the game. Now a squad player after several injury-plagued seasons, he was regarded as a super-sub; 12 of his 28 Benfica goals came from the bench.|$|E
60|$|In {{these times}} of {{electrical}} movement, {{the sort of}} construction in the moral world for which ages were once needed, takes place almost simultaneously with the event to be adjusted in history, and as true a perspective forms itself as any in the <b>past.</b> A <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> {{after the death of}} a poet of such great epical imagination, such great ethical force, as Emile Zola, we may see him as clearly and judge him as fairly as posterity alone was formerly supposed able to see and to judge the heroes that antedated it. The present is always holding in solution the elements of the future and the past, in fact; and whilst Zola still lived, in the moments of his highest activity, the love and hate, the intelligence and ignorance, of his motives and his work were as evident, and were as accurately the measure of progressive and retrogressive criticism, as they will be hereafter in any of the literary periods to come. There will never be criticism to appreciate him more justly, to depreciate him more unjustly, than that of his immediate contemporaries. There will never be a day when criticism will be of one mind about him, when he will no longer be a question, and will have become a conclusion. A conclusion is an accomplished fact, something finally ended, something dead; and the extraordinary vitality of Zola, when he was doing the things most characteristic of him, forbids the notion of this in his case. Like every man who embodies an ideal, his individuality partook of what was imperishable in that ideal. Because he believed with his whole soul that fiction should be the representation, and in no measure the misrepresentation, of life, he will live as long as any history of literature survives. He will live as a question, a dispute, an affair of inextinguishable debate; for the two principles of the human mind, the love of the natural and the love of the unnatural, the real and the unreal, the truthful and the fanciful, are inalienable and indestructible.|$|R
