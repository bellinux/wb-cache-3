2500|$|... "The Dog" [...] : The main {{character}} of the series, a Border Collie, he considers himself tough and brave, but is quite soft and sometimes cowardly. His real name, chosen by Wal's Aunt Dolly, has never been revealed. He despises this [...] "refined, aristocratic name" [...] and goes {{to great lengths to}} censor it. Wal always calls him [...] "Dog", gaining his loyal devotion. The Dog was born on October 13 at Aunt Dolly's holiday home for cats and raised by a <b>Persian</b> <b>cat</b> named Ninky Poo before being given to Wal. He is a competent sheepdog and is often put to work to guard things or get rid of rats or pigs, but Border Collies have an independent streak and the Dog's is a mile wide. He is fond of rabbits, afraid of hares and dislikes seeing trees being cut down. He has several alter egos: [...] "The Scarlet Manuka" [...] who attempts to 'liberate' cricket balls, [...] "Mitey Iron Paw", and [...] "the Grey Ghost of The Forest". The Dog has claimed to have the following commendations: V.C. (Very Cute), D.S.O. (Doesn't Steal Offal), and B.A.R (What Sheep Do), along with the alias of '00Dog' (Licensed to be kind but fair). He usually attempts to act as a 'chaperone' on Wal's dates with [...] "Cheeky" [...] Hobson, leading to disaster for Wal.|$|E
2500|$|Margaret Wade — a freckled, red-haired, bespectacled know-it-all whose cloying and self-important {{demeanor}} {{is always}} getting on Dennis' nerves. She is attracted to Dennis and is stubbornly {{confident in the}} belief that she will marry him when they are adults, but he clearly has no interest in her. She always tries to improve Dennis and his manners, but only succeeds in annoying him. She has a certain amount of dislike for Gina, whom she sees as her competition. Gina gains Dennis' respect and admiration by just being herself, and Margaret's pretensions fail to make a mark on him. Margaret, who is two years older than Dennis, is very ambitious: when she was five she decided to join the Camp Fire Girls when she reaches the age of seven; and in one comic sells Girl Scout Cookies to the Mitchells {Especially Dennis!} she likes taking ballet, singing Christmas carols, and taking piano lessons; she is a devout—if conventional—religious believer, and has a pet of her own—a white <b>Persian</b> <b>cat</b> named Snowflake (which does tricks on command). Besides hoping to marry Dennis, she also has decided to be the first female President of the United States. A running gag is that whenever Margaret tries to be genuinely nice to Dennis—such as inviting him over to her house to help decorate a Christmas tree, or to be a guest at her birthday party, or when Dennis tries to have Margaret give him too much candy-Dennis [...] "helpfulness" [...] results in him being sent home! One weakness of Dennis is that no matter how much he dislikes Margaret, he can't resist eating food at the Wades'. Margaret and Dennis are not always adversaries: one time Dennis sprayed both Margaret and Gina with his mother's perfume with a water pistol-which resulted in both girls playing with him and Dennis' mother becoming very angry with him! During one April Fool comic Dennis decided to trick Margaret with compliments instead of pranks; to Dennis' horror, Margaret accepted the joke as real and dragged poor Dennis to hear her piano playing.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the suitability of}} 99 mTc-DTPA as a radiotracer in <b>Persian</b> <b>cat's</b> renal scintigraphy. Methods: twelve adult healthy <b>Persian</b> <b>cats</b> were selected. For scintigraphy, the animals were anesthetized and 99 mTC-DTPA was injected via the femoral vein as a bolus at a dose of 1. 5 mCi. Immediately after intravenous injection of radiotracer, scintigraphic operation {{was conducted on the}} renal organ. dministration of the radioisotope and accumulation of radioisotope in the tissues was monitored by specific imaging theemanating Results: Distinct scintigraphic scans were obtained using 99 mTC-DTPA. Visual comparison of the scans indicates that {{there was no significant difference}} in the accumulation of radiotracer. In dynamic scans, symmetric and concurrent distribution of 99 mTc-DTPA in the kidney was observed. Conclusion: The results show that the radiopharmaceutical 99 mTc-DTPA is suitable for use in <b>Persian</b> <b>cat's</b> renal scintigraphy, and this makes it potentially useful in research and clinical practice...|$|R

60|$|January 5.--Went by {{invitation}} to wait upon a priest, who almost rivals my fighting bishop of Malta.

Apparently his foible was a fondness for cats; one of them, a superb brindled <b>Persian</b> <b>cat,</b> is a great beauty, and seems a particular favourite. I think we would have got on well together if he could have spoken English, or I French or Latin; but hélas!
