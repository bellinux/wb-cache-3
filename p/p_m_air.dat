Egg weights, specific gravities, albumen heights, Haugh units, U. S. D. A. scores and pH were recorded. Egg quality loss was gradual and somewhat similar for both rates of air movement. Slightly more egg weight loss occurred at 9. 5 <b>m.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> of <b>air</b> movement than at 5. 9 <b>m.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.,</b> but {{the difference was not}} significant.

40|$|Abstract. Ocean {{acidification}} is {{an important}} consequence of rising levels of atmospheric CO 2. The chemistry of acidification is, however, general and may disturb pH in terrestrial systems. The present study examines the effects of rising CO 2 on insect eggs, which may be vulnerable to acidification because they are small, have (at least initially) poorly developed physiological systems, and support important devel-opmental events. Newly-laid eggs of the moth Manduca sexta are exposed to levels of CO 2 between 0 and 2200 <b>p.</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.,</b> in <b>air,</b> and effects on yolk pH, total developmental time, and survival are measured. Altered CO 2 has no effect, over several hours, on the pH of egg yolk, suggesting that yolk fluids are well buffered. By contrast, {{there is a large}} developmental change in yolk pH. Eggs exposed to eight different levels of CO 2 for the duration of development show a small but significant parabolic response in development time.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{based on the results of}} daily {{measurements}} (taken at 1 <b>p.</b> <b>m.)</b> of <b>air</b> temperature and wind velocity and average diurnal temperatures of the air at the height of 200 cm above the ground, taken during the period from 1 st November to 31 st March in the years 1960 / 1961 - 1999 / 2000. The data were gathered at the agro-meteorological station at Lipki near Stargard, situated in the central part of the Szczecin Lowlands. For the evaluation of bioclimatic conditions, the wind chill index (WCI) was used, with the scale of heat perception defined by Maarouf and Bitzos. The perception of weather conditions was assessed during winter and spring thaw and during thawless periods. The analysis showed that the diurnal values of WCI index varied from about 370 do 1523 W m- 2. This made it possible to classify the days of this period within three categories of heat perception: comfortable, cool and cold, and a dominating category of perception during atmospheric thaw, independently of its duration, is cold. The appearance of atmospheric thaw is connected with improvement of heat perception, which is mainly illustrated by a decrease in the frequency of cold days and an increase in the frequency of cool days...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Environmental {{factors may}} {{influence}} the disease activity in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of air pollution and seasonal climate factors of any on number of relapses in MS patients during a consecutive 5 years of observation. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed data of MS patients from the town of Niš, hospitalized at the Clinic of Neurology, Clinical Center Niš, Serbia, from 2005 to 2009. Climate data: mean daily sun shining; mean monthly sun shining, mean whole daily cloudiness, daily cloudiness at 7 a. <b>m,</b> 2 <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> and 9 <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> and <b>air</b> pollution expressed by NSR (New Source Review) were obtained from the Meteorology Observatory Niš. Results. During a 5 -year of observation there were 260 relapses in 101 MS patients. The number of relapses showed a significantly negative correlation with the number of days with NSR < 2 (ρ = - 0. 31; p < 0. 01) and a positive correlation with the mean whole daily cloudiness (p < 0. 05), mean daily cloudiness at 7 a. <b>m.</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 05) and 2 <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 01). We found a significantly positive correlation (p < 0. 05) between the reduced number of relapses during the period of high vitamin D season, i. e. July-October. There was a statistically significant increase (p < 0. 01) of the number of relapses during spring (ґ = 6. 53; SD = 3. 98) compared to the other three seasons. The joint presence of lower number of days with NSR < 2 during low vitamin D season (January-April) correlated with a statistically significant increase of the number of relapses in MS patients (F = 5. 06, p < 0. 01). Conclusion. The obtained results confirmed the influence of air pollution and climate seasonal conditions on disease relapses in MS patients based on a long-term observation. Lower numbers of days with low air pollution during the periods with low vitamin D (January-April), especially with increased cloudiness at 2 <b>p.</b> <b>m,</b> induce a higher risk of MS relapses in southern continental parts of Europe...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of Wright peak flow meters is described using an absolute and precise calibration method. This showed errors {{as great as}} 25 % with the peak flow meter and 40 % with the mini peak flow meter. At large flow rates errors were less. The expected variation between individual peak flow meters was about 12 %. The expected variation between individual mini peak flow meters was between 16 % and 22 %, depending on flow rate. In both its original (Wright and McKcrrow, 1959) and restyled form the Wright peak flow meter (p. fjn.) is widely accepted for measurement of peak expira-tory flow rate. Recently a smaller, lowermost device, the mini <b>p.</b> f. <b>m.,</b> has been introduced (Wright, 1978). Two calibration methods {{have been used to}} check the various designs of <b>p.</b> f. <b>m.</b> Steady <b>air</b> flows have been blown through a flow meter connected in series with the meter. This method does not test the response of the p i jn. to non-steady airflows. Also, it depends on a flow meter which cannot readily be checked for its absolute precision. The other method compares readings from the meter with those obtained from a pneumotachograph for a single group of people. This presupposes the pneumotachograph to be properly calibrated. More important, it is imprecise because subjects do not always produce the same peak flow. In a recent report (Perks et al., 1979) the scatter of results was considerable, par-ticularly at low flows. Because of these deficiencies, we developed a calibration procedure which can be cross-checked independently. We report our findings for the three types of Wright <b>p.</b> f. <b>m.</b> : the original <b>p.</b> f. <b>m.,</b> the restyled <b>p.</b> f. <b>m.</b> and the mini <b>p.</b> f. <b>m.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS A technical description and appraisal of our calibra-tion procedure has been reported elsewhere (Shaw, Fisher and Hughes, 1979).

40|$|AbstractFacade {{and roof}} greenings enhance thermal comfort in {{building}} environment both {{indoor and outdoor}} by reducing heat transfer to and from building envelope. They shade buildings from solar radiation, absorb solar radiation for photosynthesis and evapo-transpiration, reduce solar reflection and re-radiation to atmosphere. Green façade and roof has been included as one of major green building evaluation criteria for many sustainable cities in the world nowadays. This research aims to study the use of climbing plants as vertical shading devices, “biofacade”, for naturally ventilated building with windows facing west. Blue trumpet vine (Thunbergia grandiflora) was selected due to its fast growth and consistently full leave coverage. Two experiments were carried out to compare air temperature of a room with biofacade and a room without. Natural ventilation were added to both rooms and the thermal performances were compared. It {{has been found that}} biofacade performance increased when room air velocity was high from the case with natural ventilation. The room air temperature was reduced from outside ambient air temperature to the maximum of 9. 93 °C, with an average of 3. 63 °C during day time (9 : 00 a. m. - 8 : 30 <b>p.</b> <b>m.).</b> When <b>air</b> velocity was low, the temperature difference had maximum of 6. 72 °C, average of 0. 91 °C lower than normal room. At night (9 : 00 <b>p.</b> <b>m.</b> - 8 : 30 a. m.), however, biofacade had slightly higher air temperature than normal room and outside ambient air in both cases. Unexpectedly, leaves of the selected climbers did not obstruct wind when cross ventilation was provided and air velocity inside room with biofacade was higher than room without biofacade especially in the daytime. Besides, in tropical climate, air behind leaves always maintain lower temperature than ambient air temperature, which is different from research in temperate climate where air behind leaves can sometime obtain higher temperature. From the 2 experiments, the room temperature with biofacade reduced significantly but still could not reach comfort zone (22 - 28 °C) during the day time. However, the application can be recommended to use for pre-cooling the fresh air-intake of air conditioning systems, so it can help reduce cooling load efficiently...|$|R
