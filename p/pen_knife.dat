5|$|On July 15, 1835, {{tensions}} and emotions finally overflowed and blood was spilled. Monroe County, Michigan, Deputy Sheriff Joseph Wood went into Toledo to arrest Major Benjamin Stickney, but when Stickney {{and his three}} sons resisted, the whole family was subdued and taken into custody. During the scuffle, Two Stickney, son of the major, stabbed Wood with a <b>pen</b> <b>knife</b> and fled south into Ohio. Wood's injuries were not life-threatening. When Lucas refused Mason's demand to extradite Two Stickney back to Michigan for trial, Mason wrote to President Jackson for help, suggesting that the matter be referred to the United States Supreme Court. At {{the time of the}} conflict it was not established that the Supreme Court could resolve state boundary disputes, and Jackson declined the offer. Looking for peace, Lucas began making his own efforts to end the conflict, again through federal intervention via Ohio's congressional delegation.|$|E

25|$|In Taylor's pockets, {{investigators}} found a wallet holding $78 in cash, a silver cigarette case, a Waltham pocket watch, a <b>pen</b> <b>knife,</b> and a locket bearing {{a photograph of}} actress Mabel Normand. A two-carat diamond ring was on his finger. With {{the evidence of the}} money and valuables on Taylor's body, it seemed apparent that a robbery was not the motive for the killing; however, a large but undetermined sum of cash that Taylor had shown to his accountant the day before was missing and apparently never accounted for. After some investigation, the time of Taylor's death was set at 7:50p.m. on the evening of 1 February 1922.|$|E
50|$|Ballpoint <b>pen</b> <b>knives,</b> {{because they}} allow {{a knife to}} be {{disguised}} as an innocuous object, are subject to restrictions or prohibitions in some jurisdictions. For example, in North America they are not available for sale in California or Canada.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pen</b> <b>knives</b> such {{as these}} are {{designed}} for self-defense due to their ease of concealment.

25|$|Cobb, {{during his}} career, was {{involved}} in numerous other fights, {{both on and off}} the field, and several profanity-laced shouting matches. For example, Cobb and umpire Billy Evans arranged to settle their in-game differences through fisticuffs under the grandstand after the game. Members of both teams were spectators, and broke up the scuffle after Cobb had knocked Evans down, pinned him and began choking him. In 1909, Cobb was arrested for assault for an incident that occurred in a Cleveland hotel. Cobb got into an argument with the elevator operator around 2:15a.m. when the man refused to take him to the floor where some of his teammates were having a card game. The elevator operator stated that he could only take Cobb to the floor where his room was. As the argument escalated, a night watchman approached and he and Cobb eventually got into a physical confrontation. During the fight, Cobb produced a <b>pen</b> <b>knife</b> and slashed the watchman across the hand. Cobb later claimed that the watchman, who had the upper hand in the fight, had his finger in Cobb's left eye and that Cobb was worried he was going to have his sight ruined. The fight finally ended when the watchman produced a gun and struck Cobb several times in the head, knocking him out. Cobb would later plead guilty to simple assault and pay a $100 fine. This incident has often been retold with the elevator operator and the watchman both being black. However, recent scholarship has shown that all parties involved were white.|$|E

50|$|Everyday objects, such as flashlights, {{baseball}} bats, newspapers, keyrings with keys, {{kitchen utensils}} and other tools, and hair spray aerosol cans {{in combination with}} a lighter, {{can also be used}} as improvised weapons for self-defense. Tie-wraps double as an effective restraint. Weapons such as the Kubotan (pocket stick) have been built for ease of carry and to resemble everyday objects. Ballpoint <b>pen</b> <b>knives,</b> swordsticks, cane guns and modified umbrellas are similar categories of concealed self-defense weapons that serve a dual purpose.|$|R
50|$|All ballpoint <b>pen</b> <b>knives</b> {{come with}} {{straight}} blades, which {{are easier to}} conceal than curved blades. These 2 to 5 in blades are fixed to the topmost part of the pen, hidden inside a hollow cap, serving as both the pen's end and the knife's sheath. Common blades may be the single-edged thrusting type or the double-edged stiletto type. Blades can be razor-sharp or deeply serrated {{for use in a}} range of situations. Swiss Army Spectrum Series released their S.A.S.S. Ballpoints, which look and function like regular ballpoint pens. They come with an array of foldaway blades and tools including knife, scissors, file, opener, screwdriver and battery-powered light.|$|R

50|$|Upon {{returning}} to the United States, Schrade made a final improvement to his Presto series of switchblades, filing his patent application on June 6, 1916. The next year, Schrade licensed a new flylock switchblade design to the Challenge Cutlery Company, which he then joined. Under the trademark of Flylock Knife Co., Challenge made several patterns of the flylock switchblade, including a large 5-inch folding hunter model with hinged floating guard and a small <b>pen</b> <b>knife</b> model designed to appeal to women buyers. A Challenge Cutlery advertisement of the day depicted a female hand operating a fly-lock automatic <b>pen</b> <b>knife,</b> accompanied by a caption urging women to buy one for their sewing kit {{so as not to}} break a nail while attempting to open a normal <b>pen</b> <b>knife.</b> Schrade pursued his knifemaking interests at both Challenge and at Schrade, where his brother George now managed one of the company's factories.|$|E

40|$|The term "weapon " has broad meaning. It {{includes}} {{everything from}} firearms and knives to commonplace objects like <b>pen</b> <b>knives,</b> laser pointers, aerosol/pump sprays and elastic bands. The design, intended use and specific circumstances will often dictate whether an object {{is viewed as}} a weapon or not. Section 2 of the Criminal Code of Canada defines "weapon " as follows: â€¢ Anything used or intended for use in causing death or injury to persons whether designed for that purpose or not or â€¢ Anything used or intended for use for the purpose of threatening or intimidating any person. â€¢ Firearms are included in this definition. â€¢ Prohibited weapons include gas discharge devices, numchuks, throwing stars, electronic "zappers", brass knuckles, silencers, and switchblades. 1.

Consequences may include maximum-term suspension and recommendation to the Board for expulsion...|$|R

50|$|Hom Nguyen is a self-taught {{artist whose}} work is {{characterized}} by an instinctive and lively style. He uses many different materials such as oil, acrylic, ink, felt gouache and charcoal. Colors and movement are projected onto the canvas in the same visual manner that is characteristic of Jenny Saville's treatment of the flesh. Hom can also be linked with the figurative art of Lucian Freud, due to his expressive touch and tendency to torture and layer his material. However, Hom Nguyen offers a new pictorial vocabulary that is more emotional than that of Freud. The artist creates most of his works on canvas with a brush, <b>pen,</b> and <b>knife.</b>|$|R

Hodgson also explored the subject of ships and cyclones in his story [...] "The Shamraken Homeward-Bounder" [...] (1908). Also in 1908, Hodgson published his second novel, The House on the Borderland, again to positive reviews, {{as well as an}} unusual satirical science fiction story, , a Swiftian satire in which it is suggested that war should be carried out by men fighting in <b>pens</b> with <b>knives,</b> and the corpses carefully salvaged for food, although in letters to the editor published at the time, Hodgson expressed strong patriotic sentiments.|$|R
5000|$|Firearms {{meeting the}} {{definition}} of [...] "any other weapon" [...] or AOW are weapons or devices capable of being concealed on the person from which a shot can be discharged through the energy of an explosive. Many AOWs are disguised devices such as <b>pens,</b> cigarette lighters, <b>knives,</b> cane guns and umbrella guns. AOWs can be pistols and revolvers having smooth bore barrels (e.g., H&R Handy-Gun, Serbu Super-Shorty) designed or redesigned to fire a fixed shotgun shell. While the above weapons are similar in appearance to weapons made from shotguns, they were originally manufactured in the illustrated configuration and are not modified from existing shotguns. As a result, these weapons do not fit within {{the definition of}} shotgun or weapons made from a shotgun.|$|R
