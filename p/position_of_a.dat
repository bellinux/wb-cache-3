5|$|Active solar {{techniques}} use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, {{solar thermal}} collectors, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{building to the}} Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies {{reduce the need for}} alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.|$|E
5|$|Back in Sicily, Cascioferro {{rose to the}} <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local notable. He was the capo elettore (ward heeler) of Domenico De Michele Ferrantelli, {{the mayor}} of Burgio and member of Parliament for the {{district}} of Bivona, {{as well as on}} good terms with the Baron Inglese. He exercised influence over several Mafia cosche (clans) in the towns of Bisacquino, Burgio, Campofiorito, Chiusa Sclafani, Contessa Entellina, Corleone, and Villafranca Sicula, as well as some districts in the city of Palermo.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from the NWMP, Primrose {{was offered the}} <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> police magistrate in Edmonton. Primrose accepted, as he {{had always wanted to}} retire in the city. In 1917, he was chairman of the three-person Alberta Provincial Police board of commissioners, where he was tasked with supervising the new force. Before {{his retirement}} as magistrate in July 1935, it had been estimated that he had dealt with over 40,000 cases.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Zimmerman {{accepted}} the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> clerk in the United States Census Office in Washington, D.C., {{during the second}} administration of President Grover Cleveland. During his three years serving in the United States Census Office, Zimmerman completed night courses in jurisprudence at Columbian University Law School, and {{he graduated from the}} institution with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1896. While attending Columbian University, Zimmerman also served as editor of the 1896 Class Book and resided at 915IStreet, Northwest near Mount Vernon Square.|$|E
5|$|In {{all cases}} {{this means that}} the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> planet along its orbit {{ultimately}} becomes impossible to predict with any certainty (so, for example, the timing of winter and summer become uncertain), but in some cases the orbits themselves may change dramatically. Such chaos manifests most strongly as changes in eccentricity, with some planets' orbits becoming significantly more—or less—elliptical.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target {{is not in the}} array.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{critical}} commentary varies. One critic {{points out}} that the faces of the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tail conveys what the faces lack. One critic believes the tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which sprang from a picture and story letter to a child. Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E
5|$|No {{definite}} conclusion as to {{the date}} of Nikephoros' death can be reached today, but most modern scholars, such as Jean-Claude Cheynet, are doubtful of the version of Theophanes Continuatus.

5|$|The above {{procedure}} only performs exact matches, {{finding the}} <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> target value. However, {{due to the}} ordered nature of sorted arrays, it is trivial to extend binary search to perform approximate matches. For example, binary search {{can be used to}} compute, for a given value, its rank (the number of smaller elements), predecessor (next-smallest element), successor (next-largest element), and nearest neighbor. Range queries seeking the number of elements between two values can be performed with two rank queries.|$|E
5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) {{tessellation}} uses {{more than}} one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation {{is one in which}} each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.|$|E

5|$|As Emmanuil Gushansky states, today {{subjective}} <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Russian patient {{toward a}} medical psychologist and psychiatrist is defensive {{in nature and}} prevents the attempt to understand the patient and help him assess his condition. Such a position is related to constant, subconscious fear of psychiatrists and psychiatry. This fear is caused by not only abuse of psychiatry, but also constant violence in the totalitarian and post-totalitarian society. The psychiatric violence and psychiatric arrogance as one of manifestations of such violence {{is related to the}} primary emphasis on symptomatology and biological causes of a disease, while ignoring psychological, existential, and psychodynamic factors. Gushainsky notices that the modern Russian psychiatry and the structure of providing mental health care are aimed not at protecting the patient's right to an own place in life, but at discrediting such a right, revealing symptoms and isolating the patient.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, the Butoku Kai {{promoted}} Abbe to 7th dan in judo and 6th dan in kendo. Following {{the end of}} World War II, {{however, the}} Butoku Kai and Busen were both closed down. Abbe took up the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> judo teacher for the Kyoto Prefectural Police Department. He became Chief Instructor of judo for the Kyoto police, and also taught at Doshisha University in that city. After the Abbes had a third daughter, Yayoi, Abbe resigned from the Kyoto police. During this period, he felt that judo in Japan was declining, and ended his association with the Kodokan in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In August 1981 {{the program}} {{received}} a boost when British Aerospace (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), marking the UK's re-entry into the program. The British government was enticed by the lower cost of acquiring Harriers promised {{by a large}} production run, {{and the fact that}} the US was shouldering the expense of development. Under the agreement BAe was relegated to the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subcontractor, instead of the full partner status that would have been the case had the UK not left the program. Consequently, the company received, in man-hours, 40 percent of the airframe work-share. Aircraft production took place at McDonnell Douglas' facilities in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, and manufacturing by BAe at its Kingston and Dunsfold facilities in Surrey, England. Meanwhile, 75 percent work-share for the engine went to Rolls-Royce, which had previously absorbed Bristol Siddeley, with the remaining 25 percent assigned to Pratt & Whitney. The two companies planned to manufacture 400 Harrier IIs, with the USMC expected to procure 336 aircraft and the RAF, 60.|$|E

5|$|In Bhimsen's absence, Rajendra Bikram Shah {{established}} a new battalion, Hanuman Dal, {{to be kept}} under his personal command. By February 1837, both Rana Jang Pande and his brother, Ranadal Pande, had been promoted to the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> kaji; and Ranajang was made a personal secretary to the King, while Ranadal Pande was made the governor of Palpa. Ranjang was also made the chief palace guard, the position formerly occupied by Ranbir Singh and then Bhimsen. Thus, this curtailed Bhimsen's access to the royal family. On 14 June 1837, the King took over the command of all the battalions {{put in charge of}} various courtiers, and himself became the Commander-in-Chief.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 16th century, King FrederickII of Denmark–Norway demanded that the Tsardom of Russia cede the peninsula. Russia declined, and in order to {{organize}} adequate defenses established the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> voyevoda. The voyevoda sat in Kola, which became the administrative center of the region. Prior to that, the administrative duties were performed by the tax collectors from Kandalaksha. Newly established Kolsky Uyezd covered most of the territory of the peninsula (with the exception of Varzuzhskaya and Umbskaya Volosts, which were a part of Dvinsky Uyezd), as well as the northern part of Karelia all the way to Lendery.|$|E
5|$|Kom {{gives birth}} to twins and applies for a {{government}} job. However, she refuses the <b>position</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> police constable, feeling that as a world-champion boxer, she deserves better. It devastates her to learn that people no longer recognise her. Onler encourages her to restart her boxing training. She joins the gym again, leaving her husband {{to look after the}} twins at home. Her coach is still upset about her decision to marry, but Kom makes a comeback in the National Boxing Championship. Despite performing better than her opponent, she loses the match due to the apparent partiality of the judges. Kom throws a chair in anger towards them, resulting in a ban. She later writes an apology letter, and the official accepts it, but only after insulting her.|$|E
