S. import refusals from 2002 to 2012. We find that import refusals significantly decrease exports to the United States. This trade reducing effect is driven by developing countries and by refusals without any product sample analysis, in particular during the Subprime Crisis and its aftermath. This empirical result is consistent with (but does not prove) the existence of counter-cyclical, hidden protectionism due to non-tariff barriers to trade in the United States...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{embedded}} liberalism thesis, a {{major component}} of the trade policy literature in political science, argues that governments can build support for free trade by compensating economically those hurt by trade, usually with welfare or education policies. This strategy depends, though, on opposition to trade being driven by economic factors, such as job or income loss because of increased competition. The current fair trade movement raises many non-economic criticisms of trade such as concerns about the environment and labor standards but the literature tends to treat these concerns as traditional <b>protectionism</b> <b>in</b> <b>disguise.</b> This article argues, instead, that for many these concerns are sincere and that this presents a growing challenge to the compromise of embedded liberalism. The article demonstrates this by examining survey data in the United States and showing that those who support fair trade tend to have characteristics that are opposite those who support economic protection...|$|E
40|$|The {{policy debate}} over {{globalization}} {{in the past}} decade has largely bypassed the international mobility of labor. Restrict trade and cries of protectionism resound. Suggest linking labor standards to trade and it's <b>protectionism</b> <b>in</b> <b>disguise.</b> Limit capital flows and the International Monetary Fund is on your back. But restrict people flows? That's just an accepted exercise of national sovereignty! During the last few decades, when most countries reduced barriers to trade in goods and services and liberalized financial capital markets, most also sought to limit immigration. In this essay, I examine {{what we know about the}} causes and consequences of immigration. I argue that people flows are fundamental to creating a global economy and that the interplay among immigration, capital and trade is essential to understanding the way globalization affects economies. I consider ways to reduce barriers to immigration that could improve the well-being of workers around the world. ...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: The {{principle}} of precaution has developed in International Law, {{as it has}} been present in either explicit or implicit forms in most of the celebrated international treaties dealing with the protection of the environment, over the past two decades. In spite of the huge recognition that this principle has got through incorporation, in the international order, this principle continues to be the greatest puzzle in International law for being vague, ambiguous and imprecise as well as its status in relation to being a {{principle of}} customary International Law. Conclusion/Recommendation: Elements of precaution have been incorporated into the WTO Agreements (SPS and TBT) and for the examination {{of the relationship between the}} two can only be analyzed by determining the basis upon which these measures are put in place in the agreements. WTO aims at progressive liberalization of trade and greater freedom to take risks, while precaution is an opposite attitude in decision making that reflects an aversion to risk in the face of uncertainty. The trade rules of the WTO permit countries to invoke precautionary measures especially on the basis of health or environment while justifying trade restrictions, but they face real challenges when defending a precautionary action before the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. The relationship between Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEA) and the WTO is undergoing a change from being theoretical to a tenuous one due to the new trade trends and its upshot on the environment. This paper looks to find the middle path needed for further trade progression while minimizing the effects on the environment. And answer some questions like, when an invocation of the precautionary principle is trade <b>protectionism</b> <b>in</b> <b>disguise,</b> who should bear the burden of proof when there is disagreement between parties and the effect of new trade regulations on the developing countries...|$|E

This paper then places the collapse of <b>protectionism</b> <b>in</b> the late 1950 s within the context of a general failure of protection to provide for development and a mismanaged macro-policy, leading to the acceptance of outward looking policies. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{ideas of}} Karl Polanyi’s The Great Transformation {{have often been}} re-ferred to in the recent debates that have emerged as a {{reaction}} to the rise of neo-liberal policies. This paper deals with contradictory interpretations of the notion of social <b>protectionism</b> <b>in</b> the work of Karl Polanyi. There are two opposing in-terpretations distinguished here. The first interprets social protectionism as a balancing principle of economic liberalism. The second understands social pro-tectionism as a part of market pathology. In order to assess the validity of com-peting interpretations, the author puts forth an account of social <b>protectionism</b> <b>in</b> the context of Polanyi’s theory of the economy and society. The author con-cludes that the popular notion of social protectionism as a balancing principle of economic liberalism does not correspond to Polanyi’s theory. In addition, the au-thor offers a skeptical commentary on the utility of Polanyi for understanding so-cial <b>protectionism</b> <b>in</b> social analysis.

40|$|In 1879 Germany imposed {{tariffs on}} a wide variety of {{industrial}} and agricultural goods. The German “iron and rye ” tariff marked a turning point in nineteenth-century European tariff history: the decades preceding it were characterized by trade liberalization while the following decades were characterized by a return to <b>protectionism</b> <b>in</b> continental Europe. This paper challenges the leading political-economy explanations for the adoption of the tariff that focus on the effects of a decline in European grain prices on Germany’s income distribution. Instead it claims that severe macroeconomic imbalances caused by the Franco-Prussian War indemnity played the crucial role in the rise of <b>protectionism</b> <b>in</b> Germany in the 1870 s and in the eventual adoption of the tariff. * For their help I would like to thank Guillaume Daudin, Avner Greif, Debbie Johnston...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} address the {{paradoxical}} issue of food <b>protectionism</b> <b>in</b> hungry agrarian countries. By comparing the geography of world food tariffs with that of world hunger, {{we can see that}} food tariffs are generally higher in countries plagued by chronic hunger than in their richer neighbors. This apparent contradiction is often justified by developing country governments using the popular rhetoric of food sovereignty and rural development. Consequently, international controversies surrounding world agricultural trade have revolved mainly around those barriers erected by developed countries. This paper argues that the lack of skepticism and opposition to food <b>protectionism</b> <b>in</b> developing countries are founded neither on sound economics nor solid empirical evidence, and thus a careful reassessment by all those involved must be made on this very important matter...|$|R
