2500|$|According to PayPal, {{it protects}} sellers {{in a limited}} fashion via the Seller <b>Protection</b> <b>Policy.</b> In general the Seller <b>Protection</b> <b>Policy</b> is {{intended}} to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer. PayPal states the Seller <b>Protection</b> <b>Policy</b> is [...] "designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of non-receipt of any merchandise". The policy includes a list of [...] "Exclusions" [...] which itself includes [...] "Intangible goods", [...] "Claims for receipt of goods 'not as described and [...] "Total reversals over the annual limit". There are also other restrictions {{in terms of the}} sale itself, the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to (simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the Seller <b>Protection</b> <b>Policy</b> is in effect). The PayPal Seller <b>Protection</b> <b>Policy</b> does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by UK consumer legislation (e.g., Sale of Goods Act) and in addition it cannot be enforced in the Courts because PayPal operates from Luxembourg, outside all three of the UK legal jurisdictions.|$|R

25|$|Brown was an {{unsuccessful}} candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii in 1966, {{and served in}} the Hawaii State Senate 1968 to 1974. Politically, Brown was influential on environmental and land development issues, and {{on the role of}} tourism in relationship to local social and cultural contexts. Brown managed the passage of long-term environmental <b>protection</b> <b>policies,</b> and advocated for opportunities through which the hotel industry might support the preservation of Hawaiian culture and historic sites. Brown’s position on tourism in Hawaii, made public at the 1984 Governor’s Tourism Conference, represents a key statement for the role of tourism in the state.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the efforts}} to {{preserve}} wildlife for tourism and as resources sparked the conservation movement, the true ideological development began with the institutionalization of environmental protection, which was brought forth {{through a number of}} dedicated government bureaucrats such as Robert Campbell, a Canadian Forestry Branch Director, Gordon Hewitt, a Dominion entomologist, and James Harkin, the first Parks Commissioner expressing strong conservationist philosophies. These bureaucrats actively sought administrative support from the government and intensively engaged in their own research to pass numerous environmental <b>protection</b> <b>policies.</b> Due to the efforts of Canadian government officials, the wildlife conservation movement became institutionalized and solidified. While personal experiences and encounters with environmental threats account for the efforts of these civil servants, the influence of American experience was a strong factor: the loss of the frontier, the impact of civilization with its resulting decline in wildlife numbers, and the establishment and success of American national parks. James Harkin was especially influenced by the American preservationist John Muir and his wildnerness preservation theories, while both Harkin and Douglas were well aware of the developments in American wildlife protection movements.|$|E

Vahey taught at the school from 2009 to 2013. Woodhead was the chairman of the school board.

2500|$|Land {{and water}} {{pollution}} are two of Denmark's most significant environmental issues, {{although much of the}} country's household and industrial waste is now increasingly filtered and sometimes recycled. The country has historically taken a progressive stance on environmental preservation; in 1971 Denmark established a Ministry of Environment and was the first country in the world to implement an environmental law in 1973. To mitigate environmental degradation and global warming the Danish Government has signed the Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol. However, the national ecological footprint is 8.26 global hectares per person, which is very high compared to a world average of 1.7 in 2010. Contributing factors to this value are an exceptional high value for cropland but also a relatively high value for grazing land, which may be explained by the substantially high meat production in Denmark ( [...] meat annually per capita) and the large economic role of the meat and dairy industries. In December 2014, the Climate Change Performance Index for 2015 placed Denmark {{at the top of the}} table, explaining that although emissions are still quite high, the country was able to implement effective climate <b>protection</b> <b>policies.</b>|$|E
