The Law Commissions reference to other jurisdictions is evident in the final Act with inclusions such as a gap filling provision, which is implemented in the Canadian Evidence Act. The <b>preliminary</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Act, as well as s 202, are examined to discover whether they provide for the added values of a code. It is also important that the changes caused by codification are recognised.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} achievements in the pharmacotherapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other human immunoinflammatory diseases (IIDs) late in the 20 th century is associated with the design of a fundamentally new group of medications that received the name biological agents (BAs). However, the introduction of innovative BAs into clinical practice not only could enhance the efficiency of therapy and improve prognosis in patients with the most severe forms of IIDs, but has also led to a dramatic increase in the cost of treatment. Progress in the design of biosimilars is related to many factors, including expiry of the term of patents for many brand-name BAs, such as infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, and rituximab. Over the last 5 years, a large number of biosimilars have been designed and their design is being continued. The European Medicines Agency, the World Health Organization, and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration have developed a regulatory framework and general requirements for the manufacture and characteristics of biosimilars. Federal Law No. 429 -FZ «On Amendments to the Federal Law "On Circulation of Medicines"» dated December 22, 2014 defines a biosimilar drug as a biological medicine product that is similar to the parameters of quality, efficiency, and safety with the reference biologic drug in the same formulation, and the same route of administration. The review presents an update on the requirements for biosimilars used to treat IIDs, their interchangeability and promises in further clinical application. Particular emphasis is laid on the chimeric monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-α infliximab biosimilar Flammegis (Egis Pharmaceuticals, Hungary), that has been registered in Russia for the treatment of RA, ankylosing spondylitis and other IIDs, as well as the chimeric monoclonal antibodies to B-lymphocytes rituximab biosimilar Acellbia in a phase III clinical trial that is in the closing stage. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>provisions</b> and recommendations of the All-Russian public organization «Association of Rheumatologists of Russia» concerning the place of biosimilars in rheumatology are formulated. </p...|$|E
40|$|If {{the role}} of the judge as a creator of rules is fully recognised, {{there is no need for}} a general good faith clause in a code or {{restatement}} of European private law. It may even do harm because it gives the courts an excuse for not formulating the rule which they apply. If, however, there is still some doubt as to the power of the courts, a good faith clause could be useful in order to assure that the judge may create new rules. This may be of particular importance for a new code for Europe where the Court of Justice of then European Union and the other courts may need extensive powers right from the beginning. It would then be logical not to put the article in the chapter on contract law, but right at the beginning as one of the first <b>preliminary</b> <b>provisions</b> of the code, just like in Switzerland. The wording would not matter much; experience shows that any phrase containing the words 'good faith' will suffice. However, if good faith were to have only such an Ermächtigungsfunktion, it could be argued that it would be more straightforward instead of using good faith terminology to provide expressly that the courts may interpret, supplement and correct the code where necessary. It may be argued that for the sake of tradition the term 'good faith' should be used. However, since this term may lead to hostile reactions from common law lawyers (however unjustified) 'equity' may be an acceptable compromise, since it is part of both the civil law and the common law traditions. It is submitted, however, that this term has the disadvantage of having a strong natural law connotation. Secondly, this paper shows that the concept of good faith in itself should not keep common law and civil law lawyers divided. On the one hand, common law lawyers should not fear the concept of good faith. The adoption of a general good faith clause in itself does not say anything about which rules will speak through its mouth. Good faith does not differ much from what the English lawyers have experienced with equity. The real question is whether the rules adopted by the courts mentioning good faith should be included in a European code or restatement. It does not make any more sense for a common law lawyer to fight the concept of good faith than it would have been to fight the whole of equity. Rather, good faith serves as a guarantee against the rigidity that the English fear from a code. On the other hand, civil law lawyers should not insist too much on including a good faith provision in a code or restatement of European private law. If they fully recognise what the courts do when they 'apply' good faith they should acknowledge that it should not be necessary that a court mentions the words 'good faith' when it creates a new rule which supplements or corrects the law. Common law lawyers do not believe that the law should be exclusively made by the legislator, nor do they consider it necessary that all the law should be democratically legitimated. This may largely explain why English law has not needed the concept of good faith. Finally, this paper makes clear that it is not possible to say anything on the 'content' of European good faith without knowing the system that it will be operating in. Ideally it should be empty. All the rules mentioned in Section III of the paper, for example, if accepted, could (and indeed should) be given their proper place in a code or restatement of European private law...|$|E

40|$|Introduction]. The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. First, it {{examines}} selectively the provisions of the draft Constitution pertaining to the Court of Justice and assesses the ways in which the draft Constitution is likely to affect the jurisdiction and the function of the Court. Secondly, it discusses the challenges faced by the Court in relation to the protection of human rights by reference to the recent judgment in Schmidberger. 1 Both aspects of the discussion serve to underlie that the Court is assuming the function of the Supreme Court of the Union whose jurisdiction is fundamentally constitutional in character. It has a central role to play not only in relation to matters of economic integration but also in deciding issues of political governance, defining democracy at European and national level, and contributing through the process of judicial harmonisation to the emergence of a European demos. This constitutional jurisdiction of the ECJ is not new but has acquired more importance in recent years and is set to be enhanced under the provisions of the new Constitution. The paper is divided as follows: The first section provides an overview of the way the new Constitution affects the ECJ. The subsequent sections examine respectively Article 28 (1) of the draft Constitution, the appointment and tenure of the judiciary, locus standi for private individuals, sanctions against Member States, jurisdiction under the CFSP and the Chapter on freedom, security and justice, <b>preliminary</b> references, other <b>provisions</b> o f the Constitution pertaining to the Court, the principle of subsidiarity, and the judgment in Schmidberger.

The background for this study is based on the theory of attachment from Bowlby. The problem area was confined to the use of “Parent Attachment Diary” and its function as a tool to guide foster parents when they accept infants between the ages of 10 and 28 months. The study is carried out as a single case study based on a foster family without biological offspring, and their foster children, one of whom is adopted. The foster mother made an account of events according to the guidelines given in the “Parent Attachment Diary” during the two first months of placement. An analysis of these diaries revealed that the child moved towards a secure behavior already during the first two months of placement. The foster mother firmly believed that the support and use of these diaries are instrumental in bringing about a closer relationship with foster parents and enable them to meet the child’s need for comfort and nearness, even if the child did not give any indication that, that was needed. I conducted “Working Model of the Child interview” four years later. Foster mother had a balanced description of the child and I have reason to believe that the child still has a secure attachment with the family. Foster mother also said that there were other decisions related to child care that were important during the process of preparing them as a secure base for the child. This involved practical and emotional preparations, co-operation with the short-term foster family where the child was first placed, as well as the question of adoption. Adoption has not made any difference to the child’s emotional involvement, but looked upon rather more as a relief because the child’s future was clarified.

40|$|Depuis le 1 er janvier 1994, Québec s'est doté d'un nouveau Code civil qui établit, en {{harmonie}} avec les chartes, le droit commun applicable aux rapports entre les personnes. Ainsi se pose la question de l'harmonisation de ces règles à celles qui régissent les rapports particuliers entre employeurs, syndicats et salariés. La question est d'autant plus intéressante que ce nouveau Code civil traite directement de la relation de travail et qu'il ne comporte aucune réserve à l'endroit du Code du travail et des conventions collectives. L'arrivée de ce nouveau Code civil imposera une délicate gestion des conflits de droit {{en raison de}} l'inévitable rencontre de ces deux codes, Code civil et Code du travail, et de leur acte respectif, le contrat de travail et la convention collective. Since January 1, 1994, Quebec has had a new Civil Code which, {{in combination}} with the charters of rights, establishes the common law applicable to relations between persons. Thus arises {{the question of how to}} harmonize these rules with those that govern the specifie relations between employers, unions and employees. The question is all the more interesting because this new Civil Code deals directly with the employment relationship without any reference to the Labour Code or to collective agreements. The appearance of this new Civil Code will require delicate management of conflict of laws because of the unavoidable connection between the Civil Code and the Labour Code and their respective instruments, the contract of employment and the collective agreement. The coexistence of the two codes will necessitate a re-examination of several decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada which establish that, where there is a collective agreement in place, there will no longer be room for a contract of employment. The Supreme Court of Canada itself will have to examine this issue and make the necessary distinctions, taking into account the fact that the Civil Code makes no exceptions for the employment relationship and that it now contains 13 articles dealing directly with the contract of employment. The explanation put forward on a few occasions by the Supreme Court to the effect that the collective agreement would be a tripartite contract, will no longer be acceptable. The study of the coexistence of these two codes is all the more interesting owing to the fact that the development of collective labour relations law was meant to preclude certain effects of the rules of civil law which were at the time too favourable towards Syndicat catholique des employes de magasins de Quebec Inc. v. Compagnie Paquet Ltee,[1959] R. C. S. 206;McGavin Toastmaster Udv. Ainscough,[1976] 1 R. C. S. 718;CAIMAWv. Paccar of Canada Ud,[1989] 2 R. C. S. 983. employers or which ignored the situation of employees. Now the new Civil Code lays down a series of rules meant to protect employees through the enforcement of the criteria of equality and good faith. If the contract of employees was to disappear due solely to the presence of a collective agreement, it would follow that the Quebec Civil Code would not apply to these employees, at least for the purposes intended by the Labour Code and the collective agreement. If this were the case, such employees, unions and employers, would, find themselves set aside for the same purposes and roles by the application of the following articles :— Article 2085 C. C. Q. with respect to employee loyalty;— Articles 2089, 2090 and 2095 which stipulate the contractual freedom related to the limite of free competition;— Articles 2091, 2092 and 2094 where ways to resiliate a contract of employees are set out; — Articles 2097 which ensures the survival of the employment relationship following the arrival of a new employer at the helm of the enterprise. The same applies to common law provisions concerning the respect of reputation and privacy of a person (articles 35 to 41 of the C. C. Q.), the interpretation of contracts, articles 1379, 1432, 1435 and 1436 (contract of adhesion) and the requirement of good faith (articles 6 and 7 of the C. C. Q.), etc. It should be immediately stated that it is essential that the harmonization of the rules of law not create a backlash which would allow the contract of employment to serve as a valid legal tool to reduce the real importance of the collective agreement. Furthermore, we maintain that this legitimate and necessary protection of the collective agreement should not in any way override the Quebec Civil Code, the renewed common law, nor should it repudiate the contract of employment. It should be noted that our common law, the civil law of French origin, which is codified in a concise, simple and direct style, is specific to us. It is recognized indirectly by the 1867 Constitution, since it predated the Constitution and this situation was confirmed. Barring a serious legal and political heresy, or shameful laxity, or else recalcitrant judicial imperialism, one cannot act as if our codified common law did not exist or was simply interchangeable with or able to be assimilated to the Common Law. Aside from the very existence of the Labour Code and collective agreements, the specifity of the law of collective labour relations is not so special as to require, suppose or imply that this branch of labour law be removed from the common body of Quebec private law. It should be remembered that labour law, just like its component related to collective labour relations, is concerned with persons (employee and employer), relations between these same persons and the properties to which these relations are directed or which result from these relations. However, these same three aspects are precisely those set out in the <b>preliminary</b> <b>provision</b> of the Quebec Civil Code : "The Civil Code of Quebec, ( [...] .), governs persons, relations between persons, and property". In labour law, it is necessary to be able to draw from a broad and rich source of law in order to use it as a basis for this area of law and to make up for these inevitable gaps, deficiencies or silences. This source and this general framework cannot, for constitutional, political and cultural reasons, be an avowed or hidden common law. As well, only the Civil Code of Quebec can and must serve in this way. Such is the usual legal and political function of the Quebec Civil Code, and this role can only serve to bring closer together the attributes appropriate to law, namely coherence, security, logic, foreseeable nature, etc. If the situation is as described in this paper, then we must learn how to harmonize the law of collective relations with the Civil Code of Quebec. Analyses of the contents of collective agreements confirm our common knowledge that the legal foundations of the basic data of labour relations and the employment relationship are not found there. It would be a matter of :— the presence of the employee, his constraint, his obligations to be available;— his obligation related to discretion and loyalty, etc.;— the employer's power to give orders, to discipline and even to suspend unilaterally the provision of mutual benef its, his obligation to pay a salary, his right of accession, his responsibility towards third parties somehow related to the employee, etc. If employees not covered by collective agreements are subject to the Civil Code of Quebec as codified common law there is no principle or postulate that would allow us to believe that the simple presence of a collective agreement would change this situation. In order to settle any real or apparent conflict over the terms and conditions of employment that derive from these different sources, the two necessary criteria are : public order and the objectively more favourable norm. Furthermore, there are several provisions in the Quebec Civil Code which favour employees and which cannot for whatever reason be ignored because of the existence of a collective agreement. We would also argue that, with the same reservations, the collective agreement would be subject to the Quebec Civil Code. In fact, if this common body of Quebec private law is applicable to persons and relations between persons, then it also applies to the persons and property which are the subject of collective agreements. This means in particular that the collective agreement cannot validly contain clauses that go against the provisions of public order decreed in the Quebec Civil Code (article 62 of the Labour Code) and that other provisions of the Civil Code, in as much as they are compatible, make up for the gaps, innuendos and silences of the collective agreement. Furthermore, the Labour Code sets out several special rules to manage the development of the collective agreement, to specify its contents and its importance. These special and precise rules obviously constitute as many provisions that can be added to and taken out of this same Quebec Civil Code. The sole fact that one would be tempted to use the contract of employment to reduce, violate or destroy the importance of a collective agreement cannot justify such a denial of principle. In reality, of course, employees and employers do not generally negotiate the individual employment contract. Even so, this fiction does not stand in the way of the application of the Civil Code of Quebec to employees covered by collective agreements...|$|R
