50|$|A {{revenue centre}} has costs, however {{to the manager}} of a revenue centre this is of little {{importance}} as revenue is his sole performance indicator. Not all costs are ignored in a revenue centre. For example, {{the manager of a}} revenue centre is responsible for the expenses of his department (such as maintenance costs). In a sales office (the most widespread example of a revenue centre), maintenance costs can be construed as rent, salaries, taxes and security. However, any costs related to <b>product</b> <b>sale</b> and manufacturing are not included in such expenses. A revenue centre becomes a profit centre if the latter is encompassed, thus making a profit centre a blend of both a cost and revenue centre.|$|E

50|$|In {{the same}} period Read and his team at SalesLabs ran a {{parallel}} research project to understand how top sellers structured their Sales process when pursuing a simple <b>product</b> <b>sale</b> compared to a more complex solution sale. Instead of following the sales profession's ubiquitous sales funnel, top sellers were seen to use a less linear and more cyclical approach that emphasised customer intimacy. More importantly, the research documented specific approaches top salespeople applied which were not previously common knowledge. Other researchers and authors have drawn similar conclusions about the modern solution selling process. Read published the research findings in the McGraw-Hill business book Target Opportunity Selling: Top Sales Performers Reveal What Really Works.|$|E
50|$|Producers {{such as a}} {{financial}} planner or financial adviser can help clients develop retirement plans, where compensation is either fee-based or commissioned contingent on <b>product</b> <b>sale.</b> Such an arrangement is sometimes viewed as in conflict with a consumer's interest, and that the advice rendered cannot be without bias, or at a cost that justifies its value. Consumers can now elect a do it yourself (DIY) approach. For example, retirement web-tools {{in the form of}} a calculator, mathematical model or decision support system are available online. A web-based tool that allows client to fully plan, without human intervention, might be considered a producer. Key motivations of the DIY trend are many of the same arguments for lean manufacturing, a constructive alteration of the relationship between producer and consumer.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of result related {{services}} the <b>product</b> <b>sale</b> not only becomes less important but even the product itself on plays minor role. Here client and provider both focus and agree on a result instead. There is no determined product involved. [...] Instead the focus is put on the satisfaction of the consumer need - how it is satisfied is not relevant. The product is {{owned and operated by}} the service provider. Profits are therefore correlated to efficiency and providers get a high interest in an optimized and efficient product use to achieve a long service life. In addition to this the offering of a result instead of a pre-specified product makes it possible that sustainable solutions (e.g. low material and energy consumption) can be included from the beginning on.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{contribute}} to the existing research in the field of packaging and marketing and shed more light on the psychology of colors and their effect on packaging and marketing. Nowadays, packaging is proved to be one of the significant factors in the success of promoting <b>product</b> <b>sale.</b> However, there is a perceived gap with respect to the different aspects of packaging, in particular the graphics, design, and color of packaging. The current study provides a comprehensive overview of packaging. It elaborates on different aspects of packaging and summarizes the findings of the most recent research conducted to date probing into packaging from different perspectives. It also discusses the role of color, i. e., the psychology of colors, and graphics in packaging and <b>product</b> <b>sale.</b> It is argued that graphics and color play key roles in promoting <b>product</b> <b>sale</b> and designers and marketers should attach a great deal of importance to color in packaging. The implications for producers, marketers, practitioners, and researchers are discussed in detail and suggestions for future research are provided...|$|E

An 80/20 rule fits the distribution of <b>product</b> <b>sales</b> in the catalog channel quite well, but in the Internet channel, this rule needs to be modified to a 72/28 rule in order to fit the distribution of <b>product</b> <b>sales</b> in that channel.

30|$|Adjacency {{matrices}} considered here represent CO_ 2 {{emissions in}} interindustries {{induced by the}} final demand of products for a certain industry in a certain country. These matrices are based in an atomic level on three elements that are all obtained from the World Input–Output Database (Kagawa et al. 2015; Dietzenbacher et al. 2013; Tukker and Dietzenbacher 2013): the quantities of <b>product</b> <b>sale</b> between industries of different countries, quantities of <b>product</b> <b>sale</b> to final consumers, and the amounts of carbon dioxide (CO_ 2) emission of industries in different countries. All these data are actually estimates that could possibly suffer from statistical biases such as noise and missing values. Some weaknesses such as differences between countries in price concept or in import–export-processing activities are tackled by Dietzenbacher et al. (2013). However, the risk that estimates do not match reality always exists. This can be an issue if the employed analysis is quite sensitive to errors in the used estimates, which is exactly our case.|$|E

This study uses a unique combination of accounting and perceptual data from 129 product development projects to test the combined contingency effect of product innovativeness and new product price on the relationship between development time and new <b>product</b> <b>sales.</b> The results show that for radically new products with short development times, price has no effect on new <b>product</b> <b>sales.</b> When the development time is long, price has a negative effect on the sales of radical new products.
