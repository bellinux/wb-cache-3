5|$|Trevor Francis, {{who joined}} Birmingham as a 15-year-old, {{became the first}} British footballer to be {{transferred}} for a fee of at least £1million when Brian Clough signed him for league champions Nottingham Forest in February 1979. The basic fee was below £1m – Clough claimed in his autobiography to have set the fee at £999,999 {{because he did not}} want the idea of being the first £1m player going to Francis's head – but VAT and the transfer levy raised the total payable to £1.18m. Within three months he scored the winning goal in the 1979 European Cup Final. Some four years earlier, Birmingham had also been involved in a British record transfer when they sold Bob Latchford to Everton, in <b>part</b> <b>exchange</b> for Howard Kendall and Archie Styles, the deal valuing Latchford at £350,000.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Wenger oversaw Arsenal's {{relocation}} to the Emirates Stadium. During the construction phase, he described the move as [...] "vital" [...] to the club's financial future and believed Arsenal were better able to attract the best players. Moving to the new stadium, however, presented several problems in the short term, as the club prioritised financing it over the team. Wenger sold some of his experienced players such as Campbell, Lauren and Pirès, sanctioned Cole's move to Chelsea in <b>part</b> <b>exchange</b> for defender William Gallas, and integrated young players like Theo Walcott and Alex Song into the first team. His youthful team contested the League Cup final in February 2007 and were the youngest {{to play in a}} major English cup final, averaging 21 years. They ultimately came up short against Chelsea, who won the match 2–1. Arsenal finished fourth in the 2006–07 league season; Wenger had ruled out their title chances following defeat to Bolton in November 2006. The team's lack of directness and efficiency of possession was a familiar theme during the campaign; Guardian journalist Daniel Taylor observed two matches into the league season: [...] "The most watchable side are frequently the most frustrating. Arsenal are wonderfully incisive yet infuriatingly blunt." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The woman {{listened to}} me, and through her means I {{went to live}} at another house, and earned wages there. My work was milking the cows, and making butter, and {{spinning}} wool, and weaving carpets of thin strips of cloth. One day there came to this house a pedler. In his wagon he had a guitar, an old guitar, yet a very pretty one, but with broken strings. He had got it slyly in <b>part</b> <b>exchange</b> from the servants of a grand house some distance off. Spite of the broken strings, the thing looked very graceful and beautiful to me; and I knew there was melodiousness lurking in the thing, though I {{had never seen a}} guitar before, nor heard of one; but there was a strange humming in my heart that seemed to prophesy of the hummings of the guitar. Intuitively, I knew that the strings were not as they should be. I said to the man--I will buy of thee the thing thou callest a guitar. But thou must put new strings to it. So he went to search for them; and brought the strings, and restringing the guitar, tuned it for me. So with part of my earnings I bought the guitar. Straightway I took it to my little chamber in the gable, and softly laid it on my bed. Then I murmured; sung and murmured to it; very lowly, very softly; I could hardly hear myself. And I changed the modulations of my singings and my murmurings; and still sung, and murmured, lowly, softly,--more and more; and presently I heard a sudden sound: sweet and low beyond all telling was the sweet and sudden sound. I clapt my hands; the guitar was speaking to me; the dear guitar was singing to me; murmuring and singing to me, the guitar. Then I sung and murmured to it with a still different modulation; and once more it answered me from a different string; and once more it murmured to me, and it answered to me with a different string. The guitar was human; the guitar taught me the secret of the guitar; the guitar learned me to play on the guitar. No music-master have I ever had but the guitar. I made a loving friend of it; a heart friend of it. It sings to me as I to it. Love is not all on one side with my guitar. All the wonders that are unimaginable and unspeakable; all these wonders are translated in the mysterious melodiousness of the guitar. It knows all my past history. Sometimes it plays to me the mystic visions of the confused large house I never name. Sometimes it brings to me the bird-twitterings in the air; and sometimes it strikes up in me rapturous pulsations of legendary delights eternally unexperienced and unknown to me. Bring me the guitar." ...|$|E

50|$|Car dealerships are one {{business}} sector where <b>part</b> <b>exchange</b> deals are common. They are less common in other sectors. In the housing sector, for example, {{only a few}} businesses will make <b>part</b> <b>exchange</b> deals. One such is Barratt Homes, where the <b>part</b> <b>exchange</b> deal, with buyers being offered discounts for <b>part</b> <b>exchange</b> of their old houses, has in fact been {{an integral part of}} the company's business model. There is another accounting nicety for the house builder in such deals, relating to when, exactly, to take the profit on the deal. House prices change over time, and it is possible that the housebuilder may not be able to eventually sell the old, exchanged, property for the same or more than the value that it was originally exchanged for. There are two extreme views on how to render accounts for such deals, and most accounting practices fall somewhere in the spectrum in between. The one extreme has the profit on the deal taken straightaway that the new house is sold, on the presumption that the old house will sell for its exchange value. The other extreme has the profit on the deal not taken at all until the entire deal has completed, including the sale onwards of the old house received in exchange. The major accounting considerations are making provisions at year's end for <b>part</b> <b>exchange</b> stock that remains unsold, and for the predicted marketing costs of selling it.|$|E

5000|$|Whether a <b>part</b> <b>exchange</b> is a sale or a barter is a {{fine point}} of law. It depends from whether a {{monetary}} value is assigned to the non-money goods supplied. Several cases at law clarify this. In the case of Flynn v Mackin and Mahon an old car was supplied in <b>part</b> <b>exchange</b> for a new car, along with £250. This was held to be a barter, because no monetary value was affixed to the old car. However, in Aldridge v Johnson a similar transaction was held to be a sale, because a monetary value {{was assigned to the}} item being exchanged (23 bullocks, valued at £192), and cash then used {{to make up the difference}} to the price of the item being purchased (100 quarters of barley, valued at £215). If the contract had been structured as [...] "23 bullocks and &pound;23 for 100 quarters of barley" [...] then it could have qualified as barter. It is the affixture of the monetary value of £192 to the bullocks and £215 to the barley that made it a sale. [...] Indeed, it is not necessary even for the contracting parties themselves to assign a monetary value to the goods for a <b>part</b> <b>exchange</b> deal to be held to be a sale. In Bull v Parker, the court itself assigned a value (£4) for new riding equipment, sold for some old riding equipment and £2. If goods/services have obvious monetary values, then a <b>part</b> <b>exchange</b> deal can be held to be a sale.|$|E

50|$|The middle {{portion of}} the {{movement}} lasts 48 bars and is also symmetrical in structure, made up of two fugal sections and a central episode in which the non-thematic material in the ritornello is heard again. The new fugue subject is five bars long and is first heard in the violin with a simple figured bass accompaniment in quavers. The subject is then taken up in the upper keyboard, while the violin part plays figures drawn from the continuo line, including characteristic quaver leaps in sixths. A two bar bridging passages with semiquaver scales in parallel thirds in the upper parts leads into the statement of the fugue subject in the bass line, while the upper parts develop the accompanying motifs in syncopated exchanges. At the close semiquaver scales in the bass merge into the semiquaver arpeggios from the second interlude in the ritornello, which is reprised in full with the upper <b>parts</b> <b>exchanged.</b> It {{is followed by a}} reprise of the first interlude, which leads directly into a repetition of the entire fugal section with the upper <b>parts</b> <b>exchanged.</b> This time at the close the semiquaver scales in the bass line are joined by parallel scales in the upper parts for the final cadence that heralds the concluding rendition of the ritornello.|$|R
