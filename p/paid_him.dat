5|$|Although {{this was}} a good start, Hastings was not a {{particularly}} well-known barrister, and cases were few and far between. To get around the lack of funds Hastings accepted a pupil, and for the next year Hastings lived almost exclusively off the fees that the pupil <b>paid</b> <b>him.</b> To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, claiming that they were cases of Hastings.|$|E

5|$|Atrash {{continued}} to hold the office of RCC, and was reelected as speaker on 15 February 1966, shortly before the 1966 Syrian coup d'état (21–23 February), which brought the left-wing neo-Ba'athist government of Jadid to power and caused an internal party split. The Jadid government's coming to power resulted in the self-imposed exile of the leading Ba'ath ideologue Michel Aflaq. Atrash, a partisan of Aflaq, was arrested and jailed in the Mezzeh Prison during the coup. The new defense minister and future president Hafez al-Assad later <b>paid</b> <b>him</b> a visit to discuss Syria's political situation and check on his health.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had never}} seriously {{considered}} coaching, but he agreed take the head coaching {{position with the}} Lakers in 1994 at Buss' request. In 1992, Buss had given Johnson a contract that <b>paid</b> <b>him</b> $14 million a year, as payback for all the years {{he was not the}} league's highest paid player. Although Johnson's retirement prior to the 1992–93 NBA season voided this contract, Buss insisted that he still be paid. It was this arrangement that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving any additional salary. After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss sold him a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.|$|E

5|$|Neild {{began to}} {{encounter}} difficulties in {{his political career}} {{towards the end of}} the 1880s; his oversight of the establishment of the 1887 Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition led to investigation by a Legislative Assembly select committee, which absolved him of accusations of extravagance and using his office for personal gain. In 1895 he began to agitate for old-age pensions, but in 1899 he was investigated again after Premier George Reid <b>paid</b> <b>him</b> £350 for writing a report; although Neild repaid the money, the incident was part of the pretext for a successful no confidence motion in September which brought down the Reid government.|$|E

He improved to 34 goals and 80 points in 2006–07 and was voted {{the recipient of the}} Bill Libby Memorial Award as the Kings' most valuable player by the local media. He and the Kings were unable to agree on a new contract following the season. Cammalleri was asking for $6-million per season, while the team offered $2.6 million.

5|$|The British gave Benedict Arnold a brigadier general's commission, with {{an annual}} income of several hundred pounds, but <b>paid</b> <b>him</b> only £6,315 plus an annual pension of £360 because his plot had failed. In December 1780, Arnold led a force of 1,600 troops into Virginia under orders from Clinton, where he {{captured}} Richmond by surprise {{and then went on}} a rampage through Virginia, destroying supply houses, foundries, and mills. This activity brought out Virginia's militia, led by Colonel Sampson Mathews, and Arnold eventually retreated to Portsmouth to either be evacuated or reinforced.|$|E
5|$|The CIA put {{the plan}} into motion in late 1952. A {{freighter}} {{that had been}} borrowed from the UFC was specially refitted in New Orleans and loaded with weapons {{under the guise of}} agricultural machinery, and set sail for Nicaragua. However, the plan was terminated soon after: accounts of its termination vary. Some sources state that the State Department discovered the plan when a senior official was asked to sign a certain document, while others suggest that Somoza was indiscreet. The eventual outcome was that Secretary of State Dean Acheson called off the operation. The CIA continued to support Castillo Armas; it <b>paid</b> <b>him</b> a monthly retainer of 3000 U.S. dollars, and gave him the resources to maintain his rebel force.|$|E
5|$|With Bertuzzi {{entering}} {{the final year}} of his contract, the Canucks began negotiating a contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season. Despite Bertuzzi's agent, Pat Morris, declaring that they would cease negotiations once the season began, Bertuzzi signed a four-year, $27.8 million deal with the Canucks on October 23, 2003. The contract took effect immediately, erasing the last year on his previous contract, and included a $3 million signing bonus ($2.5 million paid in the first year and $500,000 in the second).

On hearing of the Spanish–American War, Burnham rushed home to volunteer his services, but the war had ended before he could get to the fighting.

5|$|A 33-point season {{followed}} for Niedermayer in 1995–96, but the Devils {{became the first}} defending champion in 26 years to miss the playoffs. After a 35-point season in 1996–97, Niedermayer's best statistical season in New Jersey came in 1997–98 with a 14-goal, 57-point campaign. He played in his first NHL All-Star Game, scoring a goal, and {{was named to the}} NHL's Second All-Star Team at the season's end. After finishing second in league scoring amongst defencemen, despite playing in New Jersey's stifling defensive system that suppresses offence, Niedermayer demanded a significant raise. He rejected an offer that would have <b>paid</b> <b>him</b> a base salary of $3.25 million and, unable to come to terms {{before the start of the}} 1998–99 season, began the year as a holdout. As the dispute dragged into the season, he joined the Utah Grizzlies of the International Hockey League (IHL). After missing the first month of the NHL season, Niedermayer and the Devils finally agreed to a multi-year contract, the terms of which were not released. He appeared in 71 games with the Devils that season, recording 46 points.|$|E
5|$|Al-Azhar {{nevertheless}} {{remained the}} seat of Arabic philology and a place of learning throughout this period. While official classes were discontinued, private lessons were still offered in the mosque. There are reports that a scholar, possibly al-Baghdadi, taught a number of subjects, such as law and medicine, at al-Azhar. Saladin reportedly <b>paid</b> <b>him</b> a salary of 30 dinars, which was increased to 100 dinars by Saladin's heirs. While the mosque was neglected by Saladin and his heirs, {{the policies of the}} Sunni Ayyubid dynasty would have a lasting impact on al-Azhar. Educational institutions were established by Sunni rulers as a way of combating what they regarded as the heretical teachings of Shi'a Islam. These colleges, ranging in size, focused on teaching Sunni doctrine, had an established and uniform curriculum that included courses outside of purely religious topics, such as rhetorics, math, and science. No such colleges had been established in Egypt by the time of Saladin's conquest. Saladin and the later rulers of the Ayyubid dynasty would build twenty-six colleges in Egypt, among them the Salihiyya Madrasa.|$|E
