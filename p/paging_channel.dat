40|$|The {{signalling}} subsystem of the LTE (Long Term Evolution) networks inherited some of {{the limitations}} of its preceding technologies. It is vulnerable to overload situations that occur as a consequence of unpredicted user behaviour. The most sensitive zones are the paging procedure and random access procedure and the signalling channels associated with them. Reliable paging procedure is particularly important. As of the current design, in case of overload of <b>paging</b> <b>channels</b> it blocks the possibility of modification of configuration of a cell, thus limiting the possibilities of the system to recover. This research proposes and analyses a solution to overload of the <b>paging</b> <b>channels</b> in LTE systems. It shows that there is a possibility to completely avoid overload of the <b>paging</b> <b>channels</b> in surging load conditions. The research develops and verifies a mathematical model of the paging procedure. This model is incorporated in the solution, thus allowing computation of the critical load thresholds that trigger the reconfiguration of the <b>paging</b> <b>channels.</b> The solution is explained by a detailed algorithm and validated in a simulator of the LTE <b>paging</b> <b>channels.</b> It is partially compliant with the 3 GPP specifications. The research includes a compatibility analysis and underlines the operational procedures that must be defined in the standard. It is important that the implementation of the solution does not affect already deployed hardware but requires a modification of the eNb software. Thus it is possible to prevent development of the paging overload situations, and the solution can be implemented in the hardware that is already deployed in the LTE networks. The main result of this research is a reliable paging procedure that opens further opportunities for optimisation of other signalling procedures and channels...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Paging is an {{important}} mechanism for network bandwidth efficiency and mobile terminal battery life. It has been widely adopted by mobile networks, such as cellular networks, WiMax, and Mobile IP. Due to certain mechanisms for achieving paging efficiency and the convergence of wireless voice and data networks, the <b>paging</b> <b>channel</b> is vulnerable to inexpensive DoS attacks. To mitigate these attacks, we propose to leverage {{the knowledge of the}} user population size, the slotted nature of the paging operation, and the quick paging mechanism to reduce the length of terminal identifiers. In the case of a CDMA 2000 system, we can reduce each identifier from 34 bits down to 7 bits, effectively doubling the <b>paging</b> <b>channel</b> capacity. Moreover, our scheme incurs no paging latency, missed pages, or false pages. Using a simulator and data collected from a commercial cellular network, we demonstrate that our scheme doubles the cost for DoS attackers...|$|E

Our contributions are as follows: we illustrate through experiments on a CDMA 2000 cellular network that attacks launched from the Internet can significantly increase the paging load and increase the delay of paging messages including cellular call setup requests; we derive a simple but accurate queuing model for the paging system in a CDMA 2000 network and use this model to demonstrate that the <b>paging</b> <b>channel</b> exhibits sharp rather than graceful degradation under load; and through this model, we identify critical parameters that impact paging performance. Although our study is focused on CDMA 2000 networks, we believe that similar problems exist in other types of cellular networks that employ a single control channel with limited bandwidth for both voice and data services...|$|E
