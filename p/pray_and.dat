5|$|Swift did {{not fully}} embrace his popularity, but he enjoyed it. On his birthday, 30 November 1727, {{a large group of}} men came to St. Patrick's Cathedral to <b>pray</b> <b>and</b> {{afterwards}} celebrate throughout the city. This gathering commemorated Swift and his letters and also protested against the harsh British treatment of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce's {{spiritual journey}} {{is thought to}} have begun at this time. He started to rise early to read the Bible and <b>pray</b> <b>and</b> kept a private journal. He {{underwent}} an evangelical conversion, regretting his past life and resolving to commit his future life and work to the service of God. His conversion changed some of his habits, but not his nature: he remained outwardly cheerful, interested and respectful, tactfully urging others towards his new faith. Inwardly, he underwent an agonising struggle and became relentlessly self-critical, harshly judging his spirituality, use of time, vanity, self-control and relationships with others.|$|E
5|$|A week-long {{visit to}} White House Farm had been {{arranged}} for the August at the Bambers' request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant {{to stay at the}} farm. They disliked that June made them <b>pray,</b> <b>and</b> in the car on the way asked their father to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, {{it was the last time}} he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the casket with her ashes was placed in their coffin.|$|E

5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} to <b>pray,</b> <b>and</b> were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E
5|$|Baron Yamaki (Sessue Hayakawa) is a {{fisherman}} who lives {{along with his}} daughter Toya San (Tsuru Aoki) on an island. The island is inhabited by Buddhists and Yamaki had been cursed by Buddha for an affront {{by one of his}} ancestors who in a murderous rage, defiled an altar of Buddha in the nearby temple. The curse was that if his daughter married anyone, then the nearby volcano would erupt. Toya finds it difficult to form relationships with boys because the village prophet Takeo (Thomas Kurihara) has spread the rumour that she is cursed. She is therefore unwilling to continue her father's acceptance of the curse. When Yamaki takes Toya-san to the Buddha shrine in the garden of his house to <b>pray</b> <b>and</b> try to get the curse removed, she vents her feelings about the god's unfairness.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{following}} {{a flash of}} light, the stone {{at the base of}} the Mana Tree cracks, distorting time and space. The hero recalls that their friend Tess, who is a priestess, went to the Mana Tower to <b>pray,</b> <b>and</b> goes to find her. After reaching the tower with an Elemental in tow, the hero finds the tower is infested with monsters. Upon fighting their way to the top of the tower, the hero finds Tess, frightened but unharmed. Suddenly, a giant flaming bird descends upon the two. The hero attempts to fight it, but finds that the bird is protected by a barrier. A sword then falls from the sky, causing the bird's shield to fade away and allowing the hero to slay the beast. When the bird is defeated, a mysterious man garbed in black appears and attempts to take the Holy Sword, which is still stuck in the ground, but is prevented by the appearance of a barrier when he tries. The man disappears, and the hero attempts to grab the sword. No barrier appears to prevent them, and they take what turns out to be the fabled Sword of Mana.|$|E

25|$|Doherty {{is perhaps}} best known for having {{introduced}} the concept of poustinia to Roman Catholicism through her best-selling book Poustinia, first published in 1975. A poustinia is a small sparsely furnished cabin or room where a person goes to <b>pray</b> <b>and</b> fast alone in the presence of God for 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|Religion was an {{important}} aspect of Polabian society. Much of their territory was dotted with holy places in nature to which the Slavs could <b>pray</b> <b>and</b> make offerings to Slavic gods. The priesthood was {{an important}} class which developed images and objects of worship. Polabian towns often included elaborate temples often visited for offerings and pilgrimages. In contrast, priests in the countryside often lived meagerly.|$|E

25|$|The other {{characters}} of the story include the sailors in chapter 1 {{and the people of}} Nineveh in chapter 3. These characters are also contrasted to Jonah's passivity. While Jonah sleeps in the hull, the sailors <b>pray</b> <b>and</b> try to save the ship from the storm (1:4–6). While Jonah passively finds himself forced to act under the Divine Will, the people of Nineveh actively petition God to change his mind.|$|E
25|$|The second {{so-called}} sura, entitled al-Hafd (haste) {{translates as}} follows: 'O Allah, we worship You and to You we <b>pray</b> <b>and</b> prostrate and to You we run and hasten to serve You. We hope for Your mercy and we fear Your punishment. Your punishment will certainly reach the disbelievers.' Obviously these two pieces constitute so-called 'qunut', i.e. supplications which Muhammad sometimes {{said in the}} morning prayer or witr prayer after recitation of suras from the Quran. They are in fact identical to some parts of qunut reported in the collections of hadith. See: Nawawi, al-adhkar, Cairo, 1955, pp.57–8.|$|E
25|$|The strike drew few student {{participants}} though two LC {{trustees and}} several alumni did appear {{to show their}} opposition to President Aguillard. About fifty persons gathereed at the auditorium to hold hands, <b>pray,</b> <b>and</b> sing. Organizers blamed the weak turnout on fear of retaliation by the college administration. LC had warned students in a notice that a strike would constitute a possible violation of college policies {{that could result in}} severe sanctions, such as suspension, denial of a degree, or expulsion, all on the first violation of the code. Media representatives were asked to leave the campus {{at the time of the}} gathering.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{other groups}} which formed yeshivas in pre-war Poland, Belz {{maintained}} a unique yoshvim program, developed by Rabbi Yissachar Dov, which produced many outstanding Torah scholars. The yoshvim were married and unmarried men {{who remained in}} the synagogue all day to study the Talmud, <b>pray,</b> <b>and</b> derive inspiration from their Rebbe. They were supported by local businessmen, and their food and other necessities were brought to them so they wouldn't {{have to leave the}} synagogue for even a short time. Some yoshvim even slept in the synagogue on benches. They typically remained in this program until the Rebbe would tell them to return home to their wives and families.|$|E
25|$|In September 2000, dignitaries from Poland, Israel, the United States, {{and other}} {{countries}} (including Prince Hassan of Jordan) gathered {{in the city of}} Oświęcim (Auschwitz) to commemorate the opening of the refurbished Chevra Lomdei Mishnayot synagogue and the Auschwitz Jewish Center. The synagogue, the sole synagogue in Oświęcim to survive World War II and an adjacent Jewish cultural and educational center, provide visitors a place to <b>pray</b> <b>and</b> to learn about the active pre–World War II Jewish community that existed in Oświęcim. The synagogue was the first communal property in the country to be returned to the Jewish community under the 1997 law allowing for restitution of Jewish communal property.|$|E
25|$|The crypt {{is located}} {{just under the}} Church of Santa Maria della Concezione in Rome, a church {{commissioned}} by Pope Urban VIII in 1626. The pope's brother, Cardinal Antonio Barberini, who was of the Capuchin Order, in 1631 ordered the remains of thousands of Capuchin friars exhumed and transferred from the friary on the Via dei Lucchesi to the crypt. The bones were arranged along the walls in varied designs, and the friars began to bury their own dead here, {{as well as the}} bodies of poor Romans, whose tomb was under the floor of the present Mass chapel. Here the Capuchins would come to <b>pray</b> <b>and</b> reflect each evening before retiring for the night.|$|E
