40|$|The need of {{the piston}} is {{increasing}} with {{the increasing number of}} motorcycles. Piston are not only made by large scale producers but also by small and medium industries. Challenges faced by small and medium industries are how to compete with large industry due to limited knowledge and technology in the field of metal casting. The material used is secondhand aluminum and addition aluminum alloy ADC 12 which is a composition of silicon < 12 %. The research is done with making mould of die casting and making of moulding machine. Variable selected in this research is die temperatur (250 °C, 320 oC, 350 ºC and 400 oC) and cast temperatur is 800 ºC which pass trough casting process with method of die casting to know the casting defect that happen analysed visually. Preparation of casting by melting secondhand aluminum and ADC 12 whice later to process casting. Results show the casting defects that happened for example cold shut, shrinkage, rough surface and porosity. Optimum die temperatur in process casting piston product with metode of die casting is die temperatur 320 ºC, because this temperatur defect that happened in the from of shrinkage happened some of just small at area below cover rough surface that happened of piston products that can still be tolerated.

40|$|A {{combustion}} chamber of a Diesel engine, constructed with cylinder liners, <b>piston,</b> cylinder <b>cover,</b> etc, operates under very serious conditions in high temperature and pressure.

50|$|Two {{of these}} engines, the {{enlarged}} single-row Hornet B described {{here and the}} R-1830 Twin Wasp, were of near-identical displacement (1860 vs. 1830), although the fourteen-cylinder Twin Wasp was more complex and costly than the nine-cylinder, single-row Hornet B. The Twin Wasp {{was by far the}} more powerful engine though, even in its early versions it produced 800 bhp to the Hornet B's 575 bhp. Having more cylinders per the same displacement also creates a smoother engine, since the individual pistons are smaller and lighter, and the stroke is shorter, which reduces the vibration of reciprocation, and therefore crew and mechanical fatigue. The reduced stroke also allows for a higher maximum RPM limit, since the mean piston speed is reduced, the distance the <b>piston</b> has to <b>cover</b> per each engine revolution being shorter. Having a shorter stroke but a higher rpm limit for the same displacement reduces the peak torque levels, but allows for a higher maximum horsepower rating. A further advantage was the reduced diameter of the Wasp: 48 inches compared to 57. This reduced drag, and the relatively large diameter of the Hornet would also have been a serious drawback for visibility if used in a small single-engined aircraft.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{stability}} and transition to turbulence of wall-bounded unsteady velocity profiles with reverse flow. Such flows occur, for example, during unsteady boundary layer separation and in oscillating pipe flow. The main focus is on results from experiments in time-developing flow in a long pipe, which is decelerated rapidly. The flow is generated by the controlled motion of a piston. We obtain analytical solutions for laminar flow in the pipe and in a two-dimensional channel for arbitrary piston motions. By changing the piston speed {{and the length of}} <b>piston</b> travel we <b>cover</b> a range of values of Reynolds number and boundary layer thickness. The velocity profiles during the decay of the flow are unsteady with reverse flow near the wall, and are highly unstable due to their inflectional nature. In the pipe, we observe from flow visualization that the flow becomes unstable with the formation of {{what appears to be a}} helical vortex. The wavelength of the instability [simeq R: similar, equals] 3 [delta] where [delta] is the average boundary layer thickness, the average being taken over the time the flow is unstable. The time of formation of the vortices scales with the average convective time scale and is [simeq R: similar, equals] 39 /([Delta]u/[delta]), where [Delta]u=(umax[minus sign]umin) and umax, umin and [delta] are the maximum velocity, minimum velocity and boundary layer thickness respectively at each instant of time. The time to transition to turbulence is [simeq R: similar, equals] 33 /([Delta]u/[delta]). Quasi-steady linear stability analysis of the velocity profiles brings out two important results. First that the stability characteristics of velocity profiles with reverse flow near the wall collapse when scaled with the above variables. Second that the wavenumber corresponding to maximum growth does not change much during the instability even though the velocity profile does change substantially. Using the results from the experiments and the stability analysis, we are able to explain many aspects of transition in oscillating pipe flow. We postulate that unsteady boundary layer separation at high Reynolds numbers is probably related to instability of the reverse flow region...|$|R
