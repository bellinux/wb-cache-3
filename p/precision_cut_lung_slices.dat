40|$|Bronchoconstriction {{has been}} {{proposed}} to underlie airway remodelling. However, the mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. An important contributor to airway remodelling, in particular airway smooth muscle remodelling is the multifunctional cytokine TGF-β, which can facilitate airway smooth muscle maturation by inducing the expression of contractile proteins. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an in vitro model which allows investigation of mechanisms involved in the bronchoconstriction-induced airway remodelling. To this aim, <b>precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> of guinea pigs were used. Lung slices were viable for at least 2 days. Stimulation with either methacholine or TGF-β 1 augmented the expression of contractile proteins makers including sm-myosin, sm-β-actin and calponin after 2 days. The expression of sm-myosin was particularly enhanced in the peripheral airways (400 μM). Inhibition of actin polymerization by Latrunculin A or of TGF-β receptor kinase by SB 431542 prevented the methacholine effects and the effects of other bronchoconstricting agents including histamine and KCl on contractile protein expression. This indicates the release of biologically active TGF-β in response to bronchoconstriction, ensuing contractile protein expression and thus airway smooth muscle remodelling. The anticholinergic tiotropium bromide inhibited the methacholineinduced contractile protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Collectively, bronchoconstriction induces the release of biologically active TGF-β and promotes remodelling. Muscarinic receptor induced remodelling can be counteracted by the use of the anticholinergic tiotropium bromide. <b>Precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> are a valid in vitro model to study mechanisms involved in airway remodelling induced for example, by bronchoconstriction...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: Airway remodelling {{in chronic}} asthma is {{characterized}} by thickening of the airway wall, including thickening of the smooth muscle layer. Although studies using cellular and molecular models have provided important insights into the mechanisms that underpin airway remodelling, limitations of these models include the prolonged cell culture {{and the loss of}} the multicellular context of the airway wall. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate <b>precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> as an in vitro model to study airway remodeling. Lung slices have all cell types in their natural matrix and largely intact tissue architecture. Previously, we showed that TGFß 1 and the muscarinic receptor agonist methacholine (MCh) increased the expression of contractile phenotype markers in cultured human airway smooth muscle cells. Here, we studied the effects of these stimuli on airway remodeling in lung slices. METHODS: Lung slices, obtained from guinea pigs after filling the lungs with 1. 5 % agarose, were prepared and cultured in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of TGFß 1 (0. 1 - 2 ng/mL) or MCh (10 μM). Slices were tested for viability using a mitochondrial reduction assay. Protein expression was quantified by Western blot and visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Initial experiments indicated that lung slices could be cultured for at least 48 hours without loss of cellular viability. Therefore, in subsequent experiments protein expression and localization was determined in lung slices cultured up to 48 h. Western blot analyses showed a concentration-dependent and time-dependent increase in the expression of the contractile proteins myosin, calponin and α-smooth muscle (sm) -actin in response to TGFß 1. Additionally, myosin, calponin and α-sm-actin protein expression were increased in response to MCh. Confocal fluorescence microscopy visualized the 3 D architecture of airways and parenchymal tissue up to ~ 100 μm depth and showed that the treatment with TGFß 1 and MCh augmented α-sm-actin expression predominantly in the small airways and peribronchiolar tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, <b>precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> are a suitable model to study mechanisms of airway remodeling in vitro. Limitations of the model include the relatively short window in which slices can be kept in culture compared to cell culture, whereas its strengths include the multicellular architecture and the possibility to study protein localization in a 3 D context. This suggests that future studies using <b>precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> could be used to extrapolate results from studies in isolated cells to more physiologically intact systems...|$|E
40|$|Bronchospasm induced in non-asthmatic human {{subjects}} {{can be easily}} reversed by a deep inspiration (DI) whereas bronchospasm that occurs spontaneously in asthmatic subjects cannot. This physiological effect of a DI {{has been attributed to}} the manner in which a DI causes airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells to stretch, but underlying molecular mechanisms-and their failure in asthma-remain obscure. Using cells and tissues from wild type and zyxin-/- mice we report responses to a transient stretch of physiologic magnitude and duration. At the level of the cytoskeleton, zyxin facilitated repair at sites of stress fiber fragmentation. At the level of the isolated ASM cell, zyxin facilitated recovery of contractile force. Finally, {{at the level of the}} small airway embedded with a <b>precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slice,</b> zyxin slowed airway dilation. Thus, at each level zyxin stabilized ASM structure and contractile properties at current muscle length. Furthermore, when we examined tissue samples from humans who died as the result of an asthma attack, we found increased accumulation of zyxin compared with non-asthmatics and asthmatics who died of other causes. Together, these data suggest a biophysical role for zyxin in fatal asthma...|$|R
40|$|Background: COPD is a {{progressive}} lung disease characterized by emphysema and enhanced bronchoconstriction. Current treatments focused on bronchodilation can delay disease progression to some extent, but recovery or normalization {{of loss of}} lung function is impossible. Therefore, novel therapeutic targets are needed. The importance of the parenchyma in airway narrowing is increasingly recognized. In COPD, the parenchyma and extracellular matrix are altered, possibly affecting airway mechanics and enhancing bronchoconstriction. Our aim was {{to set up a}} comprehensive ex vivo <b>Precision</b> <b>Cut</b> <b>Lung</b> <b>Slice</b> (PCLS) model with a pathophysiology resembling that of COPD and integrate multiple readouts in order to study the relationship between parenchyma, airway functionality, and lung repair processes. Methods: Lungs of C 57 Bl/ 6 J mice were sliced and treated ex vivo with elastase (2. 5 mu g/ml) or H 2 O 2 (200 mu M) for 16 h. Following treatment, parenchymal structure, airway narrowing, and gene expression levels of alveolar Type I and II cell repair were assessed. Results: Following elastase, but not H 2 O 2 treatment, slices showed a significant increase in mean linear intercept (Lmi), reflective of emphysema. Only elastase-treated slices showed disorganization of elastin and collagen fibers. In addition, elastase treatment lowered both alveolar Type I and II marker expression, whereas H 2 O 2 stimulation lowered alveolar Type I marker expression only. Furthermore, elastase-treated slices showed enhanced methacholine-induced airway narrowing as reflected by increased pEC 50 (5. 87 at basal vs. 6. 50 after elastase treatment) and Emax values (47. 96 vs. 67. 30 %), and impaired chloroquine-induced airway opening. The increase in pEC 50 correlated with an increase in mean Lmi. Conclusion: Using this model, we show that structural disruption of elastin fibers leads to impaired alveolar repair, disruption of the parenchymal compartment, and altered airway biomechanics, enhancing airway contraction. This finding may have implications for COPD, as the amount of elastin fiber and parenchymal tissue disruption is associated with disease severity. Therefore, we suggest that PCLS can be used to model certain aspects of COPD pathophysiology and that the parenchymal tissue damage observed in COPD contributes to lung function decline by disrupting airway biomechanics. Targeting the parenchymal compartment may therefore be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of COPD...|$|R
40|$|RATIONALE Cyclic AMP (cAMP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} second messengers and is involved as a target for the therapy of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an airway disease primarily provoked by cigarette smoke. Cyclic nucleotide hydrolyzing phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are able to degrade cAMP or cGMP within subcellular compartments, thereby potentially altering pulmonary responses including airway contractility and inflammation. In the present study, we combine the <b>precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slice</b> (PCLS) technique in mice with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to monitor cAMP in real time. METHODS To monitor the cAMP levels in lung tissues, transgenic mice (CAG-Epac 1 -camps) that express the FRET-based cAMP sensor Epac 1 -camps were used for the preparation of PCLS. The β 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist fenoterol was applied to elevate intracellular cAMP. To achieve PDE subtype specific inhibition, the PDE 4 inhibitor rolipram, the PDE 3 inhibitor cilostamide and the PDE 2 inhibitor BAY 60 - 7550 were used. The nonselective PDE inhibitor 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX) served as a control. Moreover, <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> were exposed to 2. 5 % cigarette smoke extract (CSE) for 24 hours used as a COPD model in vitro. RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS We provide evidence that the FRET and PCLS technologies can be combined in CAG-Epac 1 -camps mice to measure global cAMP. Moreover, we found in fenoterol-stimulated PCLS that PDE 4 accounts for more than 80 % of the total cAMP-PDE activity. Besides PDE 4, PDE 3 known as a cGMP-inhibited PDE also contributes to cAMP hydrolysis, indicating that cGMP may modulate the maintenance of local cAMP in PCLS. In contrast, the cGMP-activated PDE 2 plays a limited role in cAMP hydrolysis. Exposure to CSE did not alter the FRET signal in the presence of the PDE 4 inhibitor under fenoterol stimulated conditions. In contrast, we found that a significant increase could be observed in PDE 3 -dependent FRET responses (p< 0. 05). Under basal conditions, CSE treatment altered local cAMP levels by significantly increasing both PDE 4 and PDE 3 inhibitor effects. Therefore, as the major lung cyclic nucleotide hydrolyzing enzymes PDE 3 and PDE 4 are both involved in the local regulation of the cAMP levels in the β 2 -AR microdomain, our findings suggest that exposure to CSE induced alterations in the PDEs activity profile both under basal conditions and in the presence of the β 2 -agonist fenoterol...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lymphatic vessels play {{a pivotal}} role in fluid {{drainage}} and egress of immune cells from the lung. However, examining murine lung lymphatics is hampered by the expression of classical lymph endothelial markers on other cell types, which hinders the unambiguous identification of lymphatics. The expression of CD 90 /Thy- 1 on lymph endothelium was recently described and we therefore examined its suitability to identify murine pulmonary lymph vessels under healthy and inflammatory conditions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal antibody against CD 90. 2 /Thy- 1. 2 on 200 µm thick <b>precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> labeled a vascular network that was distinct from blood vessels. Preembedding immunostaining and electron microscopy verified that the anti-CD 90. 2 /Thy- 1. 2 antibody labeled lymphatic endothelium. Absence of staining in CD 90. 1 /Thy- 1. 1 expressing FVB mice indicated that CD 90 /Thy- 1 was expressed on lymph endothelium and labeling was not due to antibody cross reactivity. Double-labeling immunohistochemistry for CD 90 /Thy- 1 and α-smooth muscle actin identified two routes for lymph vessel exit from the murine lung. One started in the parenchyma or around veins and left via venous blood vessels. The other began in the space around airways or in the space between airways and pulmonary arteries and left via the main bronchi. As expected from the pulmonary distribution of lymph vessels, intranasal application of house dust mite led to accumulation of T cells around veins and in the connective tissue between airways and pulmonary arteries. Surprisingly, increased numbers of T cells were also detected around intraacinar arteries that lack lymph vessels. This arterial T cell sheath extended to the pulmonary arteries where lymph vessels were located. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that CD 90 /Thy- 1 is expressed on lymphatic endothelial cells and represents a suitable marker for murine lung lymph vessels. Combining CD 90 /Thy- 1 labeling with <b>precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> allows visualizing the anatomy of the lymphatic system in normal and inflamed conditions...|$|E
40|$|Small airway and vessels play a {{critical}} role in chronic airway and pulmonary vascular diseases, but their pharmacology has not been well characterised.

40|$|Rat <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> and {{isolated}} rat lung cells {{were used to}} study the secretion of phosphatidylcholine by the lung in vitro.

Washing labeled <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> or cells with a nonlysing concentration of Triton X- 100 (0. 05 %) did not selectively release labeled phosphatidylcholine, indicating that any secreted phosphatidylcholine did not adhere to the surface of the <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> or cells. Experiments were performed to determine whether the small amount of phosphatidylcholine in the medium and detergent-released phosphatidylcholine was similar to the tissue and cell phosphatidylcholine. The saturated fatty acid composition of the phosphatidylcholine released by Triton X- 100 and in the medium (from <b>lung</b> <b>slices)</b> was identical to that of the tissue phosphatidylcholine. In addition, the relative labeling rates of the phospholipids released by Triton X- 100 and in the medium (labeled with [14 C]glycerol) were identical to those of the tissue and cell phospholipids.

40|$|Obstructive lung {{diseases}} {{are characterized by}} increased sensitivity of the airways (AHR) including peripheral neuronal hyperreactivity.

Local TRPV 1 positive nerves are extensively co expressed with sensory neuropeptides. Local axon reflex response leads to the release of neuropeptides and provoke neurogenic inflammation including bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, inflammatory cell migration and mast cell degranulation.

The lungs are a prominent target organ for numerous types of chemically-induced pathological changes. Current concepts of the pathogenesis of lung injury and repair are derived from in vitro and in vivo investigations. In light of the increasing emphasis on in vitro techniques for toxicologic research, the precision-cut <b>lung</b> <b>slice</b> model was extended to the mouse to determine the predictive value of this system for assessing interspecies differences in metabolism and toxicity. Validation of the <b>lung</b> <b>slice</b> model as a toxicological tool was accomplished by examining several biochemical parameters of functional viability and correlating them with histologic parameters in control <b>lung</b> <b>slices.</b> In addition, comparative studies utilizing rat and mouse <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> were completed to justify statements regarding interspecies validation. Characterization of the model as a toxicological tool for studying interspecies differences was accomplished by studies with two classic pneumotoxicants, paraquat and butylated hydroxytoluene. These well-characterized lung toxins are uniquely different in their mechanisms of action and toxicity. Results indicated that this in vitro model system can be used to mimic the acute in vivo toxicity of direct-acting compounds, including the production of cell-specific injury. Thus, utilization of the <b>lung</b> <b>slice</b> model to screen the toxicity of several alkylphenols was also approached. The alkylphenols that were examined include butylated hydroxytoluene, eugenol, p-cresol, p-isopropylphenol, and two structural analogs of butylated hydroxytoluene (BMP and BDMP).

Our results confirmed the initial increase in glycolytic metabolism induced by paraquat, but also indicated that the 6 - 14 CO 2 production was significantly inhibited by paraquat when <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> were incubated in a 95 % oxygen phase. The fact that the glucose metabolism in alveolar macrophages is more sensitive to paraquat exposure than that of cells in <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> {{may be related to the}} genesis of the intra-alveolar pulmonary lesions described in the literature.

On incubation in Krebsphosphate solution, <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> from mice exposed to 200 ppm ozone released a smaller fraction of their content of ascorbic acid into the medium than did <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> from control mice, suggesting {{that there was a}} preferential loss of extracellular ascorbic acid during ozone exposure.

Biological effects of four CBNP modifications with different surface properties were assessed in human pulmonary cell lines (16 HBE 14 o-, Calu- 3, A 549) and <b>precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> (PCLS) of mice, rats and humans. Viability was assessed by LIVE/DEAD® staining and WST- 1 / 8 assay. Pro-inflammatory immune responses in PCLS were quantified using ELISA. CBNP-induced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed by flow cytometry using the DCFH-DA assay. The effect of CBNP exposure on transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was investigated in Calu- 3 cells. CBNP Printex® 90, acetylene soot, and benzo[a]pyrene nanoparticles were nearly non toxic in cell lines and PCLS. However, the dose-response relationships varied considerably between cell lines. 9 -Nitroanthracene Printex 90 showed a toxic effect at 50 g/ml in PCLS. The inflammatory response was assessed in tissue lysate and decreased intracellular cytokine concentration. Increased ROS formation was observed in cell lines with all CBNP tested. TEER reduction was observed with all CBNP tested with acetylene soot particles being most effective. The combination of cell and tissue culture models is useful to assess the acute effects of nanomaterials on lungs...|$|E
40|$|In the pig, {{respiratory}} co-infections involving various pathogens are {{far more}} frequent than single infections. Amongst respiratory viruses, swine influenza type A virus (swIAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are frequently associated. Previously, we performed co-infections with swIAV and PRRSV in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) and <b>precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> (PCLS). With these two approaches it was practically impossible to have co-infections of the same cells as the main target cell of swIAV is the epithelial cell while the main target of PRRSV is the PAM. This constraint makes the study of interference between the two viruses difficult at the cellular level. In the current report, an epithelial cell line expressing, CD 163, the main receptor of PRRSV was generated. This cell line receptive for both viruses {{was used to assess}} the interference between the two viruses. Results showed that swIAV as well as PRRSV, even if they interacted differently with the modified epithelial cells, were clearly interfering with each other regarding their replication when they infected a same cell with consequences within the cellular antiviral response. Our modified cell line, receptive to both viruses, {{can be used as a}} tool to assess interference between swIAV and PRRSV in a same cell as it probably happens in the porcine host...|$|E
40|$|Background: Even {{protective}} ventilation may aggravate or induce lung failure, {{particularly in}} preinjured lungs. Thus, new adjuvant pharmacologic strategies {{are needed to}} minimize ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Intermedin/Adrenomedullin- 2 (IMD) stabilized pulmonary endothelial barrier function in vitro. We hypothesized that IMD may attenuate VILIassociated lung permeability in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings: Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (HPMVEC) monolayers were incubated with IMD, and transcellular electrical resistance was measured to quantify endothelial barrier function. Expression and localization of endogenous pulmonary IMD, and its receptor complexes composed of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) 1 – 3 were analyzed by qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence in non ventilated mouse lungs and in lungs ventilated for 6 h. In untreated and IMD treated mice, lung permeability, pulmonary leukocyte recruitment and cytokine levels were assessed after mechanical ventilation. Further, the impact of IMD on pulmonary vasoconstriction was investigated in <b>precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> (PCLS) and in isolated perfused and ventilated mouse lungs. IMD stabilized endothelial barrier function in HPMVECs. Mechanical ventilation reduced the expression of RAMP 3, but not of IMD, CRLR, and RAMP 1 and 2. Mechanical ventilation induced lung hyperpermeability, which was ameliorated by IMD treatment. Oxygenation was not improved by IMD, which {{may be attributed to}} impaired hypoxi...|$|E

40|$|There is {{emerging}} epidemiological data {{to suggest that}} upper respiratory tract bacterial colonisation in infancy may {{increase the risk of}} developing respiratory dysfunction later in life, and respiratory viruses are known to precipitate persistent colonisation. This study utilized a neonatal mouse model of Streptococcus pneumonia (SP) and influenza A virus (IAV) co-infection, where bronchoalveolar leukocyte infiltration had resolved by adulthood. Only co-infection resulted in persistent nasopharyngeal colonisation over 40 days and a significant increase in airway resistance in response to in vivo methacholine challenge. A significant increase in hysteresivity was also observed in IAV and co-infected mice, consistent with ventilatory heterogeneity and structural changes in the adult lung. Airway hyper-responsiveness was not associated with a detectable increase in goblet cell transdifferentiation, peribronchial smooth muscle bulk or collagen deposition in regions surrounding the airways. Increased reactivity was not observed in <b>precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> challenged with methacholine in vitro. Histologically, the airway epithelium appeared normal and expression of epithelial integrity markers (ZO- 1, occludin- 1 and E-cadherin) were not altered. In summary, neonatal co-infection led to persistent nasopharyngeal colonisation and increased airway responsiveness that was not associated with detectable smooth muscle or mucosal epithelial abnormalities, however increased hysteresivity may reflect ventilation heterogeneity...|$|E
40|$|Research {{from basic}} science has remarkably changed the general {{perception}} of 3 D organotypic tissue models. <b>Precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> (PCLS) display such a suitable ex vivo tissue model that maintains microanatomy and functionality of the respiratory tract. The model allows {{the investigation of}} effects of compounds and drugs directly on cytokine release and functional responses such as bronchoconstriction under similar experimental conditions in different species including human. The tissue can be stimulated with, e. g., chemicals, lipopolysaccharides, bronchoconstricting agents and disease-related proteins. Depending on the underlying immunology, lipopolysaccharides and proteins such as IL- 13 induce an acute increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or airway hyperresponsiveness. Effects of chemicals were shown to correlate with in vivo inhalation toxicity studies. We found that the tissue response is highly comparable with the in vivo response. In summary, PCLS {{can be used as}} model to study several features of lung injury, COPD and asthma ex vivo. The different tissue responses can be used for the prediction of toxicological endpoints and adverse health outcomes such as organ injury, respiratory sensitization and inflammation. The presentation will give an overview about the current use of lung tissue in inhalation toxicity but also state their use for drug research...|$|E
40|$|Increased procoagulant {{activity}} in the alveolar compartment and uncontrolled inflammation are hallmarks of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here, we investigated whether the contact phase system of coagulation is activated and may regulate inflammatory responses in human lungs. Components of the contact phase system were characterized in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) from 54 ARDS patients and 43 controls, {{and their impact on}} cytokine/chemokine expression in human <b>precision</b> <b>cut</b> <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> (PCLS) was assessed by a PCR array. Activation of the contact system, associated with high levels of coagulation factor XIIa (Hageman factor, FXIIa), plasma kallikrein and bradykinin, occurred rapidly in ARDS lungs after the onset of the disease and virtually normalized within one week from time of diagnosis. FXII levels in BALF were higher in ARDS non-survivors than survivors and were positively correlated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α concentration. FXII induced the production and release of interleukin (IL) - 8, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), CXCL 5 and TNF-α in human PCLS in a kallikrein-kinin-independent manner. In conclusion, accumulation of FXII in ARDS lungs may contribute to the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and is associated with clinical outcome. FXII inhibition may thus offer a novel and promising therapeutic approach to antagonize overwhelming inflammatory responses in ARDS lungs without interfering with vital haemostasis...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular {{dynamics}} of airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) mediate ASMC contraction and proliferation, and thus {{play a key}} role in airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and remodelling in asthma. We evaluate the importance of store-operated entry (SOCE) in these dynamics by constructing a mathematical model of ASMC signaling based on experimental data from <b>lung</b> <b>slices.</b> The model confirms that SOCE is elicited upon sufficient depletion of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), while receptor-operated entry (ROCE) is inhibited in such conditions. It also shows that SOCE can sustain agonist-induced oscillations in the absence of other influx. SOCE up-regulation may thus contribute to AHR by increasing the oscillation frequency that in turn regulates ASMC contraction. The model also provides an explanation for the failure of the SERCA pump blocker CPA to clamp the cytosolic of ASMC in <b>lung</b> <b>slices,</b> by showing that CPA is unable to maintain the SR empty of. This prediction is confirmed by experimental data from mouse <b>lung</b> <b>slices,</b> and strongly suggests that CPA only partially inhibits SERCA in ASMC...|$|R
40|$|The {{etiology}} of airway hyperresponsiveness associated with asthma {{requires an understanding}} of the regulatory mechanisms mediating human airway smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine how human airway SMC contraction (induced by histamine) and relaxation (induced by formoterol) are regulated by Ca 2 + oscillations and Ca 2 + sensitivity. The responses of human small airways and their associated SMCs were studied in human <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> <b>cut</b> from agarose-inflated <b>lungs.</b> Airway contraction was measured with phase–contrast video microscopy. Ca 2 + signaling and Ca 2 + sensitivity of airway SMCs were measured with two-photon fluorescence microscopy and Ca 2 +-permeabilized <b>lung</b> <b>slices.</b> The agonist histamine induced contraction of human small airways by stimulating both an increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration in the SMCs in the form of oscillatory Ca 2 + waves and an increase in Ca 2 + sensitivity. The frequency of the Ca 2 + oscillations increased with histamine concentration, and correlated with increased contraction. Formoterol induced airway relaxation at low concentrations by initially decreasing SMC Ca 2 + sensitivity. At higher concentrations, formoterol additionally slowed or inhibited the Ca 2 + oscillations of the SMCs to relax the airways. The action of formoterol was only slowly reversed. Human <b>lung</b> <b>slices</b> provide a powerful experimental assay for the investigation of small airway physiology and pharmacology. Histamine induces contraction by simultaneously increasing SMC Ca 2 + signaling and Ca 2 + sensitivity. Formoterol induces long-lasting relaxation by initially reducing the Ca 2 + sensitivity and, subsequently, the frequency of the Ca 2 + oscillations of the airway SMCs...|$|R
