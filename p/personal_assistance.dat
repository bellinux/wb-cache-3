This first widely publicised flight led to a more organized effort between aviators and scientists, leading the way to modern aerodynamics.|$|E

Victims within the Massachusetts regiment were transported to Washington D.C. after the violence, which happened to be Clara Barton's home at the time.

There is home care in which a family member, volunteer, or trained professional will aid the person in need and help with daily activities. Another option is community services which can provide the person with transportation, meal plans, or activities in senior centers. A third option is assisted living where 24-hour round-the-clock supervision is given with aid in eating, bathing, dressing, etc. A final option is a nursing home which provides professional nursing care.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} the authors present the {{framework}} of a system for assisting users through counseling on personal health, the <b>Personal</b> Health <b>Assistance</b> Service Expert System (PHASES). <b>Personal</b> health <b>assistance</b> systems need <b>Personal</b> Health Records (PHR), which support wellness activities, improve the understanding of personal health issues, enable access to data from providers of health services, strengthen health promotion, and in the end improve the health of the population. This is especially important in societies where the health costs increase at a higher rate than the overall economy. The most important elements of a healthy lifestyle are related to food (such as balanced nutrition and diets), activities for body fitness (such as walking, sports, fitness programs), and other medical treatments (such as massage, prescriptions of drugs). The PHASES framework uses an ontology of food, which includes nutritional facts, an expert system keeping track of personal health data that are matched with medical treatments, and a comprehensive data transfer between patients and the system.

2500|$|The escape {{network was}} not {{literally}} underground nor a railroad. It was figuratively [...] "underground" [...] {{in the sense}} of being an [...] resistance. It was known as a [...] "railroad" [...] by way of the use of rail terminology in the code. The Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and safe houses, and <b>personal</b> <b>assistance</b> provided by abolitionist sympathizers. Participants generally organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting [...] "stations" [...] along the route but knew few details of their immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next. [...] "Conductors" [...] on the railroad came from various backgrounds and included free-born blacks, white abolitionists, former slaves (either escaped or manumitted), and Native Americans. Church clergy and congregations often played a role, especially the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), Congregationalists, Wesleyans, and Reformed Presbyterians, as well as certain sects of mainstream denominations such as branches of the Methodist church and American Baptists. Without the presence and support of free black residents, there would have been almost no chance for fugitive slaves to pass into freedom unmolested.|$|E

In his first term, his colleagues {{included}} his subsequent opponent for mayor, Victor Schiro, and A. Brown Moore, a World War II decorated veteran who ran for lieutenant governor in 1956. Fitzmorris represented District 6 from 1954 to 1962 and was the councilman at-large from 1962 to 1966. In the election of 1965, Fitzmorris challenged incumbent Mayor Schiro in the Democratic primary and appeared {{to have a strong}} chance of success. One of the other candidates, Gerald J.

The storm changed the dynamics of the race, as the media depicted U.S. President Lyndon B.

It was his ambition that some day this daughter would become a famous female detective, but he refused to allow her to assume professional duties until she had become thoroughly qualified to excel. He did not wish her to be ordinary, but extraordinary, and Josie's talents, so far, had seemed to justify his expectations. Mary Louise knew Josie very well and admired and loved her, for in her amateur way Josie had once helped to solve a stubborn mystery that threatened the happiness of both the old Colonel and his granddaughter, and through this experience the two girls had become friends.

Life in Mr. Kennedy's house had gone quietly during the intervening three weeks, but not very pleasantly. The name of Phineas Finn had not been mentioned. Lady Laura had triumphed; but she had no desire to acerbate her husband by any unpalatable allusion to her victory. And he was quite willing to let the subject die away, if only it would die. On some other matters he continued to assert himself, taking his wife to church twice every Sunday, using longer family prayers than she approved, reading an additional sermon himself every Sunday evening, calling upon her for weekly attention to elaborate household accounts, asking for her <b>personal</b> <b>assistance</b> in much local visiting, initiating her into his favourite methods of family life in the country, till sometimes she almost longed to talk again about Phineas Finn, so {{that there might be a}} rupture, and she might escape.

60|$|When Miss Starbrow, {{in a fit}} of anger, had {{dismissed}} her maid {{some months}} before, and then had accepted some little <b>personal</b> <b>assistance</b> in dressing for the play, and at other times, from her housemaid, Rosie at once imagined that she was winning her way to her mistress's heart, and her silly dream was that she would eventually get promoted to the vacant and desirable place of lady's-maid. The cast-off dresses, boots, pieces of finery, and many other things which would be her perquisites would be a little fortune to her, and greatly excited her cupidity. But there were other more important considerations: she would occupy a much higher position in the social scale, and dress well, her hands and skin would grow soft and white, and her appearance and conversation would be that of a lady; for to be a lady's-maid is, of course, the nearest thing to being a lady. And with her native charms, ambitious intriguing brain, what might she not rise to in time? and she had been so careful, and, she imagined, had succeeded so well in ingratiating herself with her mistress; and by means of a few well-constructed lies had so filled Miss Starbrow with disgust at the ordinary lady's-maid taken ready-made out of a registry-office, that she had begun to look on the place almost as her own. She had quite overlooked the small fact that she was not qualified to fill it, and never would be. If she had proposed such an arrangement, Miss Starbrow would have laughed heartily, and sent the impudent minx away with a flea in her ear; but she had not yet ventured to broach the subject.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the study: To {{determine}} whether reported falls at baseline {{are associated with}} an older adult’s decision to make a residential adjustment (RA) {{and the type of}} adjustment made in the subsequent 2 years.  Design and Methods: Observations (n = 25, 036) were from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative sample of community-living older adults, 65 years of age and older. At baseline, fall history (no fall, 1 fall no injury, 2 or more falls no injury, or 1 or more falls with an injury) and factors potentially associated with RA were used to predict the initiation of an RA (i. e., moving, home modifications, increased use of adaptive equipment, family support, or <b>personal</b> care <b>assistance)</b> during the subsequent 2 years.  Results: Compared with those with no history of falls, individuals with a history of falls had higher odds of making any RA. Among those making an RA, individuals with an injurious fall were more likely than those with no history of a fall to start using adaptive equipment or increase their use of <b>personal</b> care <b>assistance.</b>  Implications: The higher initiation of RAs among fallers may indicate proactive steps to prevent future falls and may be influenced by interactions with the health care system. To optimize fall prevention efforts, older adults would benefit from education and interventions addressing optimal use of RAs before falls occur...|$|R
