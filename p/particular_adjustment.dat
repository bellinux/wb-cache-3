Furthermore, we find evidence of an important spillover effect from rises in the minimum wage to firms with no workers earning the minimum wage.

40|$|An {{experimental}} research {{to study the}} effects of controlled drainage systems on the rate of water outflow from agricultural fields was performed on two suitably-equipped catchment areas in the municipality of Ponte di Piave, in the province of Treviso, each covering an area of about 7 hectares. The experience acquired in the two experimental catchment areas demonstrated the efficacy of the controlled drainage system both in moderating the maximum flow rates and in reducing the total drainage volumes released by the field where said system was in use. Concerning the reduction in drain-flows obtainable by means of the controlled drainage by comparison with the conventional drainage system, it is worth emphasizing that, over the period 1993 - 1995, the volume flowing out of the field area under controlled drainage was about half the volume flowing out of the conventional drainage area.

40|$|Starting from October 2009, {{redemption}} {{of government}} securities {{was transferred to}} the real-time gross settlement system (VIBER) developed for the settlement of time-critical transfers and operated by MNB. This step ensures that the settlement of redemption is performed in the clearing system where the financial performance related to the issue of government securities has been carried out for a long time. Channelling redemption to VIBER has achieved its goal, as it allowed the issuer (the Hungarian state) to use the funds stemming from the issue for the purposes of repayments and manage its liquidity in a simpler and more flexible way. In addition, this change has not caused a significant liquidity shortfall for participants in either of the two payment systems. This resulted in clearly less liquidity demand in the financial settlement processes related to the issue of government securities and redemption upon expiry.

His definition of σ, however, differs from the present one (Eq.  3); indeed, his σ was described as “the width {{of the range of}} stimulus levels where ψ [the psychometric function] shows non- asymptotic behavior” [33], p. 2100]. The latter width was defined by Garcia-Perez using a mathematical rule involving a parameter chosen to give a σ that was “the width of the central 98 % span of ψ” [33], p. 2100]. Garcia-Perez ran simulations of two-alternative forced-choice staircases, each of which was run until 200 reversals had occurred; from these the average of the last 180 reversals was taken as the detection threshold. Garcia- Perez used those to examine the behavior of the “landing point”, that is, “the percentage-correct point on which the staircase converges” [33], p. 2101] under any <b>particular</b> <b>adjustment</b> rule and final step size and ratio of final step size to σ. That is, for each combination of conditions, he ran 5, 000 replications, in order to obtain mean values and standard deviations of the detection thresholds (although he did not discuss their actual distributions).

40|$|The {{gradually}} accelerating pace {{at which}} tolls are being implemented or actively considered {{around the world}} suggests that road pricing is {{an idea whose time}} may finally have come. Nevertheless, various design considerations must be addressed and public acceptability hurdles overcome if road pricing is to become widespread. And to measure the efficiency gains and welfare-distributional effects of road pricing accurately, models need to account for potential behavioural responses to tolls [...] and in <b>particular</b> <b>adjustments</b> in trip timing. This paper analyzes some road pricing schemes using the dynamic network simulator METROPOLIS: a tool that treats endogenously departure-time decisions as well as mode and route choices of individual travelers. Simulations are conducted for a stylized urban road network that consists of radial arterials and circumferential ring roads, and with trip origins and destinations that are distributed throughout the network. Six types of link-tolling schemes are analyzed: (1) the system optimum which can be supported approximately by imposing time-varying step tolls that eliminate queuing, (2) a set of comprehensive flat (time-independent) tolls, (3, 4) second-best flat and step tolls for a toll cordon, and (5, 6) second-best flat and step tolls within a charge area. Two results show the superiority of step tolls over flat tolls. First, step tolls easily outperform flat tolls in terms of welfare gains while inducing a smaller shift of trips from auto to transit. Second, step tolls generate smaller revenues than do flat tolls, and consequently have more favourable distributional impacts on travelers. ...|$|R

This paper estimates the cost of financing constraints to firms, for example in terms of idle investment opportunities, and their aggregate implications. In {{the first part of}} the paper I use firm level panel data to demonstrate that, on average, the returns to capital in Ghanaian manufacturing are large, while investment rates are low and largely uncorrelated with returns to capital.

To quantify the extent to which financing constraints matter, I then develop and estimate a dynamic model of firm-level investment.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{discovery}} and {{the description of}} the genetic background of common human diseases is hampered by their complexity and dynamic behavior. Appropriate bioinformatic tools are needed to account all the facets of complex diseases and to this end we recently described the survival dimensionality reduction (SDR) algorithm in the effort to model gene–gene interactions in the context of survival analysis. When one event precludes the occurrence of another event under investigation in the ‘competing risk model’, survival algorithms require <b>particular</b> <b>adjustment</b> to avoid the risk of reporting wrong or biased conclusions. MethodsThe SDR algorithm was modified to incorporate the cumulative incidence function as well as an adapted version of the Brier score for mutually exclusive outcomes, to better search for epistatic models in the competing risk setting. The applicability of the new SDR algorithm (SDR-CR) was evaluated using synthetic lifetime epistatic datasets with competing risks and on a dataset of scleroderma patients. Results/conclusionsThe SDR-CR algorithms retains a satisfactory power to detect the causative variants in simulated datasets under different scenarios of sample size and degrees of type I or type II censoring. In the real-world dataset, SDR-CR was capable of detecting a significant interaction between the IL- 1 α C- 889 T and the IL- 1 β C- 511 T single-nucleotide polymorphisms to predict the occurrence of restrictive lung disease vs. isolated pulmonary hypertension. We provide an useful extension of the SDR algorithm to analyze epistatic interactions in the competing risk settings that may be of use to unveil the genetic background of complex human diseases.
