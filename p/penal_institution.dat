5|$|After the Puerto Rican league season {{came to an}} end in 1932, Coimbre went to work as a {{security}} guard in a <b>penal</b> <b>institution</b> and only played with a semi-professional team. Shortly after, he was offered a contract to play in La Guaira, with a team called Santa Marta. The season concluded with Buchipluma, a second team owned by Santa Marta's proprietor winning the league's championship. Following his participation with Santa Marta, he continued playing, both in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. While playing with Licey, the team developed a rivalry with El Escogido, which gave Coimbre an opportunity to establish relationships with several players, from both countries. During this period the team continued to be coached by Dore, and included several known Dominican players. The team would win the league's championship once, but Coimbre decided not to assist the ceremony where the trophy was awarded choosing to stay in his hotel room instead. Dore took the cup to Coimbre so that he could have it in his possession some days, but he rejected this and suggested that it be filled with money for a donation.|$|E

40|$|In my diploma work I {{present the}} use of theatre in <b>penal</b> <b>institutions.</b> In the first part – the {{theoretical}} part – I describe the system of <b>penal</b> <b>institutions.</b> This {{is not just a}} system in which individuals with different characteristics and from different social and cultural environments serve penalty. It is also a society within a society. Due to its limited possibilities, {{it is a place where}} special relationships, norms, values and opinions are developed. In my diploma work I focus on theatre in general, the theatre of the oppressed, different theatre methods and {{the use of}} theatre in prison. Theatre of the oppressed is a medium which can be used with oppressed individuals or groups, and people serving prison penalty are reckoned among the oppressed. The last chapter of the theoretical part is about using theatre in social pedagogy. The second part of my diploma work – the qualitative part – contains results of interviews done in three different <b>penal</b> <b>institutions.</b> I compare characteristics of all three <b>penal</b> <b>institutions.</b> I wonder whether the pedagogical workers in these <b>penal</b> <b>institutions</b> consider cultural and art activities and theatre useful, and in what way. I also ascertain what knowledge of the theatre of the oppressed do they possess. My purpose is to introduce the three <b>penal</b> <b>institutions,</b> their systems and the potencial use of theatre within these systems. <b>Penal</b> <b>institutions</b> offer various cultural and art activities, including theatre, but the latter is not used as one of the methods in pedagogical work. ...|$|R

They are also important spaces {{in their own right}} retaining the stark open character of a <b>penal</b> <b>institution</b> required for surveillance. The extensive forecourt of the main cell block, with its scale and secure location within the perimeter walls, is particularly impressive. Paths are bitumen with grassed garden beds delineated by raised brick edging. South Knoll comprises the remains of the high, natural ground level which at least by 1896 had been terraced to form flat, grassed areas. The former playing fields and tennis courts are still in evidence. There is a brick- vaulted reservoir located under the Knoll. The significant landscape presents an austere and formal quality within the perimeter walls. [...] Generally the landscape is sparse and simple, comprising unobtrusive elements such as lawn, low plantings and pavement. [...] Landscape elements outside the walls include the exotic almond and pine trees on the Terrace.|$|E

[...] Appointed by the Governor of Montana for their pliability, ease of placement, and political stature, the wardens of the prison rarely had law enforcement experience, and none had <b>penal</b> <b>institution</b> experience. [...] Unfortunately, due to Conley's aggressive control of the facility, most of {{the administration of the}} prison rested {{in the hands of the}} warden, including the hiring and firing of guards, requests for new building permits from the state, and most of the parole functions of the institution. [...] In fact, a parole board was not instituted until 1955. [...] Many of the wardens, like A.B. Middleton, tried to better the facility, but those who did often failed. [...] Middleton, who held the position from 1925 to 1937, oversaw all the new construction, but he did little to ease the strain of overpopulation and low morale. [...] Possibly the least effective warden to hold the office was Faye O. Burrell, who was warden from 1953 to 1958. [...] Burrell had been a Ravalli County sheriff before his tenure, and was a man who prided himself on his frugality. [...] The state actually increased funding to the prison during his time, but Burrell decreased his implementation of funds, allowing money slated for updating facilities to go back into general state funds. [...] His wardenship of the prison weathered two riots, and he resigned under heavy controversy.|$|E
6000|$|... recalls drearily our ancient enemy, the Metrical Romance; {{while the}} fighting, which, in those old poems, was tediously sincere, is between shadow and shadow, where {{we know that}} neither can harm the other, though are tempted to wish he might. Hazlitt bids us not mind the allegory, and says that it won't bite us nor meddle with us {{if we do not}} meddle with it. But how if it bore us, which after all is the fatal question? The truth is that it is too often forced upon us against our will, as people were {{formerly}} driven to church till they began to look on a day of rest as a <b>penal</b> <b>institution,</b> and to transfer to the Scriptures that suspicion of defective inspiration which was awakened in them by the preaching. The true type of the allegory is the Odyssey, which we read without suspicion as pure poem, and then find a new pleasure in divining its double meaning, as if we somehow got a better bargain of our author than he meant to give us. But this complex feeling must not be so exacting as to prevent our lapsing into the old Arabian Nights simplicity of interest again. The moral of a poem should be suggested, as when in some mediaeval church we cast down our eyes to muse over a fresco of Giotto, and are reminded of the transitoriness of life by the mortuary tablets under our feet. The vast superiority of Bunyan over Spenser {{lies in the fact that}} we help make his allegory out of our own experience. Instead of striving to embody abstract passions and temptations, he has given us his own in all their pathetic simplicity. He is the Ulysses of his own prose-epic. This is the secret of his power and his charm, that, while the representation of what may happen to all men comes home to none of us in particular, the story of any one man's real experience finds its startling parallel in that of every one of us. The very homeliness of Bunyan's names and the everydayness of his scenery, too, put us off our guard, and we soon find ourselves on as easy a footing with his allegorical beings as we might be with Adam or Socrates in a dream. Indeed, he has prepared us for such incongruities by telling us at setting out that the story was of a dream. The long nights of Bedford jail had so intensified his imagination, and made the figures with which it peopled his solitude so real to him, that the creatures of his mind become things, as clear to the memory as if we had seen them. But Spenser's are too often mere names, with no bodies to back them, entered on the Muses' musterroll by the specious trick of personification. There is likewise, in Bunyan, a childlike simplicity and taking-for-granted which win our confidence. His Giant Despair,[296] for example, is by no means the Ossianic figure into which artists who mistake the vague for the sublime have misconceived it. He is the ogre of the fairy-tales, with his malicious wife; and he comes forth to us from those regions of early faith and wonder as something beforehand accepted by the imagination. These figures of Bunyan's are already familiar inmates of the mind, and, if there be any sublimity in him, it is the daring frankness of his verisimilitude. Spenser's giants are those of the later romances, except that grand figure with the balances in the second Canto of Book V., the most original of all his conceptions, yet no real giant, but a pure eidolon of the mind. As Bunyan rises not seldom to a natural poetry, so Spenser sinks now and then, through the fault of his topics, to unmistakable prose. Take his description of the House of Alma,[297] for instance:-- ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Until today, {{inadequate}} {{attention has}} been paid to the distinguishing attributes of healthcare provision in prisons. It has been conceived either as ancillary or as a core component of imprisonment. While the former idea prevailed in the past, leading to a bio-medical approach to care in prisons, the latter is currently arising. Method: This paper discusses the change in the approach to care in Italian <b>penal</b> <b>institutions,</b> examining their inertia. The design of the research consisted of a mixed approach: at the beginning, a desk study of law documents was realized; then, a semi-structured 48 -item questionnaire was addressed to the health managers operating in the <b>penal</b> <b>institutions</b> of a southern Italian region. Results: The study suggests that penitentiary health areas are prone to change and they are willing to establish inter-organizational relationships with healthcare organizations operating within the National Health Service. Notwithstanding, they have to cope with the institutional inertia of <b>penal</b> <b>institutions,</b> that favour organizational monism. The legislative efforts are not sufficient to foster a process of change in prisons; healthcare professionals usually act as catalysts of change, championing it and encouraging the reorganization of penitentiary healthcare. Conclusions: This study paves the way to both further theoretical developments and to practical implications. On the one hand, it suggests a reconceptualization of healthcare provision within <b>penal</b> <b>institutions,</b> claiming the belonging of penitentiary health to public health. On the other hand, <b>penal</b> <b>institutions</b> are unwilling to change, due to their nature of total institutions: the involvement of healthcare professional in fostering the reorganization of healthcare provision is thus crucial to legitimate the process of change...|$|R
