5|$|Cleomenes had {{fortified}} all the passes into Laconia with barricades and trenches {{before setting}} {{off with his}} army of 20,000 men to the <b>pass</b> <b>at</b> Sellasia, on the northern border of Laconia. Overlooking the <b>pass</b> <b>at</b> Sellasia were two hills, Evas and Olympus. Cleomenes positioned his brother, Eucleidas, with the allied troops and the Perioeci on Evas; he stationed himself on Olympus with 6,000 Spartan hoplites and 5,000 mercenaries.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan {{immediately}} closed all NATO {{supplies to}} Afghanistan {{in the aftermath}} of the attack, leaving the blockaded supply trucks vulnerable to attacks.

5|$|After a 39-yard {{field goal}} by Leigh Tiffin {{extended}} {{the lead to}} 17–0 in the third, the Bulldogs scored their only points of the night on a 34-yard Derek DePasquale field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Javier Arenas returned the ball 46 yards and on the next play, McElroy hit Julio Jones for a 48-yard touchdown reception. The score was 24–3. Mark Barron intercepted a Tyson Lee <b>pass</b> <b>at</b> the Alabama 30 on the next Bulldog offensive series. On the following play, Ingram scored a touchdown on a 70-yard run to bring the final score to 31–3.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological evidence, {{such as the}} Serpent Column (now in the Hippodrome of Constantinople), also {{supports}} some of Herodotus' specific claims. George B. Grundy was the first modern historian to do a thorough topographical survey of the narrow <b>pass</b> <b>at</b> Thermopylae, {{and to the extent}} that modern accounts of the battle differ from Herodotus' they usually follow Grundy's. For example, the military strategist Sir Basil Henry Liddell Hart defers to Grundy.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in 1766. During the Sejm in October of that year, Poniatowski {{attempted}} to push a radical reform, restricting the disastrous liberum veto policy. He was opposed by conservatives such as Michał Wielhorski, who were supported by the Prussian and Russian ambassadors, who threatened war if the reform was passed. The dissidents, supported by the Russians, formed a confederation, the Radom Confederation. Abandoned by the Familia, Poniatowski's reforms failed to <b>pass</b> <b>at</b> the Repnin Sejm, named after Russian ambassador Nicholas Repnin, who promised to guarantee the Golden Liberties of the Polish nobility, enshrined in the Cardinal Laws, with all the might of the Russian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Ole Miss {{wasted no}} time in scoring, as Steve Hindman turned the first play of the second half into a 79-yard for a touchdown. The Rebels now held a 2117 lead, and Virginia Tech never {{threatened}} afterward. Ole Miss defender Bob Bailey intercepted a Virginia Tech <b>pass</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of the fourth quarter and returned it 70 yards for another Mississippi touchdown. The Rebels also added a pair of field goals to their score, and rolled to a 3417 victory over Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|The 6th Division's next {{campaign}} was the failed Battle of Greece, {{a disaster for}} the British Commonwealth forces sent there. While in Greece, Mackay led a hastily assembled Australian-British-New Zealand-Greek formation known as Mackay Force, defending the Klidi <b>Pass</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Vevi. The Allies were forced to retreat in a fierce assault by the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade. Mackay was the only Australian general to face the Waffen-SS in battle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pass</b> <b>at</b> Thermopylae {{was thus}} {{opened to the}} Persian army, {{according}} to Herodotus, at {{the cost to the}} Persians of up to 20,000 fatalities. The Greek rearguard, meanwhile, was annihilated, with a probable loss of 2,000 men, including those killed on the first two days of battle. Herodotus says, at one point 4,000 Greeks died, but assuming the Phocians guarding the track were not killed during the battle (as Herodotus implies), this would be almost every Greek soldier present (by Herodotus' own estimates), and this number is probably too high.|$|E
5|$|Yet Manuel's army of 35,000 men {{was large}} and {{unwieldy}} – according to a letter that Manuel sent to King Henry II of England, the advancing column was ten miles (16km) long.

Just outside {{the entrance to the}} <b>pass</b> <b>at</b> Myriokephalon, Manuel was met by Turkish ambassadors, who offered peace on generous terms. Most of Manuel's generals and experienced courtiers urged him to accept the offer. The younger and more aggressive members of the court urged Manuel to attack, however, and he took their advice and continued his advance.|$|E

5|$|Blankett and Elphinstone united off the Cape on 10 June 1795 and {{anchored}} in Simon's Bay. There messages {{were sent to}} Sluysken offering an alliance against the French. The Dutch governor was inclined to resist however, evacuating the civilian population from Simon's Town in early July and making preparations to raze the town. To prevent this, Craig landed 800 soldiers and Royal Marines on 14 July, who occupied Simon's Town while the Dutch withdrew to the <b>pass</b> <b>at</b> Muizenberg, through which passed the road to Cape Town. For the next month the two armies observed an uneasy truce, broken by occasional patrols and sniping. During this period, Elphinstone and Sluysken continued negotiations for the surrender of the colony. These negotiations were stalled by disputes in the colonial government regarding {{the legitimacy of the}} deposed William of Orange and suspicion concerning British intentions. While the debates continued, British envoys were permitted free movement in Cape Town, making detailed observations of the defences.|$|E
5|$|Cloud cover {{over the}} target and bad radio {{communication}} meant the B-24 formation broke up. The smaller B-24 formation lost their way and crossed into the Netherlands near Woensdrecht. After wandering over North Netherlands they turned north towards the North Sea where they ditched their bombs. II. and IV./JG 1 took off from Woensdrecht and München-Gladbach to intercept while 5. and 6./JG 1 refuelled at Schiphol. 4./JG 1 made one <b>pass</b> <b>at</b> the bombers and two Liberators were claimed but not confirmed. 12./JG 1 intercepted over Terschelling, downing two Liberators. Of these, one {{was the result of}} a collision with a downed Fw-190 that cut the bomber's tail, 12./JG 1's only loss.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{during the}} American {{occupation}} of Mexico after the Mexican-American War, Raynolds and other U.S. Army personnel {{were the first}} confirmed to have reached the summit Pico de Orizaba, the tallest mountain in Mexico, and inadvertently set {{what may have been}} a 50-year American alpine altitude record. In 1859, Raynolds was placed in charge of the first government-sponsored expedition to venture into the upper Yellowstone region that was later to become Yellowstone National Park. Heavy winter snowpack in the Absaroka Range of Wyoming prevented the expedition from reaching the Yellowstone Plateau, forcing them to divert to the south and cross Union <b>Pass</b> <b>at</b> the northern end of the Wind River Range. After negotiating the pass the expedition entered Jackson Hole and surveyed the Teton Range, now within Grand Teton National Park.|$|E

5|$|In 1897, Capper was {{attached}} to the force dispatched to the Tirah Campaign on the North-West Frontier of British India. One of his tasks there was to supervise the construction of the first road for wheeled vehicles across the Khyber <b>pass.</b> <b>At</b> the campaign's successful conclusion, he was promoted to major and transferred to South Africa while his wife Edith Mary (neé Beausire) and their son John Beausire Copeland Capper returned to England. Arriving in South Africa at the outbreak of the Second Boer War, Capper became deputy assistant director of railways, a vital job given the lengthy and dangerous supply routes along which the war was fought. In 1900, he received the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel and commanded several locally raised units, eventually becoming the commandant at Johannesburg. He returned to England in June 1902, following the end of hostilities the previous month, and on 31 October 1902 was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).|$|E
5|$|Khan {{realizes that}} he can make the girls winners only if he can help them {{overcome}} their differences. During his first few days as coach he benches several players who refuse to follow his rules—including Bindia Naik (Shilpa Shukla), his most experienced player. In response, Bindia repeatedly encourages the other players to defy Khan. When she finally succeeds, Khan angrily resigns; however, he invites the staff and team to a farewell lunch at McDonald's. During the lunch, local boys make a <b>pass</b> <b>at</b> Mary; Balbir attacks them, triggering a brawl between the boys and the team. Khan, recognizing that they are acting as one for the first time, prevents the staff from intervening; he only stops a man from hitting {{one of the women}} from behind with a cricket bat, telling him that there are no cowards in hockey. In an about-face, after the fight the women ask Khan to remain as their coach.|$|E
5|$|Navy {{began the}} third quarter with a 9-play, 60-yard {{touchdown}} drive composed completely of runs.

Three plays later, Navy running back Zerbin Singleton ran 65 yards for another touchdown, making the score 58–49. The Mean Green responded with a 7-play, 59-yard drive, which ended with another Vizza touchdown pass to Casey Fitzgerald. On the next play from scrimmage, Kettani ran 49 yards.

After a 14-yard pass from Forcier to Gallon, Vincent Smith scored on an 8-yard run to give Michigan a 44–14 lead. Bowling Green then drove 69 yards and scored on a 2-yard run by Jordan Hopgood. Michigan held Bowling Green scoreless in the fourth quarter and added three more touchdowns on runs of 1 yard by Vincent Smith, 5 yards by Fitzgerald Toussaint and 7 yards by Devin Gardner. Toussaint also had a 61-yard run in the fourth quarter to set up his touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Roadways, wooden bridges, postal {{stations}}, and relay {{stations were}} occasionally repaired, while many new facilities {{such as these}} were established. As written by Han authors, roads built during the Han were tamped down with metal rammers, yet there is uncertainty over the materials used; Joseph Needham speculates that they were rubble and gravel. The widths of roads ranged from narrow footpaths where only a single horse or oxen could <b>pass</b> <b>at</b> once to large highways that could accommodate the simultaneous passage of nine horse-drawn chariots abreast. Fortified Han roadways were built as far west as Shanshan (Loulan) near the Lop Desert, while Han forces utilized routes that traversed north of the Taklamakan Desert towards Kashgar. A vast network of roads, fortified passes, and wooden bridges built over rushing torrents in steep gorges of the Qin Mountains was consolidated during the Han, known as the gallery roads. During the reign of Emperor Wu, roads were built to connect newly conquered territories {{in what is now}} Yunnan in the far southwest as well as the Korean Peninsula in the far northeast.|$|E
