5|$|In 1959, Nhu {{tried to}} assassinate Sihanouk by sending him a <b>parcel</b> <b>bomb.</b> As a result, Sihanouk {{routinely}} gave asylum to political refugees {{who had tried}} to depose or kill Diệm. In November 1960, he had given asylum to a group of paratroopers who tried to depose Diệm.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} coup, Đông, Thi, Lieu {{and several other}} {{prominent}} officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a C-47. They fled to Cambodia, where they were happily given asylum by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Cambodia and South Vietnam had been on bad terms; Cambodia {{turned a blind eye}} to Vietnamese communists using their territory as a staging ground, while Diệm and Nhu had tried to foment opposition and had supported attempts to overthrow the Cambodian leader. Nhu had failed in a 1959 attempt to assassinate Sihanouk with a <b>parcel</b> <b>bomb,</b> and both nations' leaders despised one another.|$|E

5000|$|The {{terrorism}} {{was also}} real, {{and had been}} going on since 1914 in a series of <b>parcel</b> <b>bombs.</b> [...] In 1919 two campaigns of mail bombing were discovered. In 1920 there would be a major terrorist bomb attack on Wall Street.|$|R
5|$|In December 1958 Ngo Dinh NhuDiem's {{younger brother}} and chief adviserbroached {{the idea of}} {{orchestrating}} a coup to overthrow Sihanouk. Nhu contacted Dap Chhuon, Sihanouk's Interior Minister, who {{was known for his}} pro-American sympathies, to prepare for the coup against his boss. Chhuon received covert financial and military assistance from Thailand, South Vietnam, and the CIA. In January 1959 Sihanouk learned of the coup plans through intermediaries who were in contact with Chhuon. The following month, Sihanouk sent the army to capture Chhuon, who was summarily executed {{as soon as he was}} captured, effectively ending the coup attempt. Sihanouk then accused South Vietnam and the United States of orchestrating the coup attempt. Six months later, on 31August 1959, a small packaged lacquer gift, which was fitted with a <b>parcel</b> <b>bomb,</b> was delivered to the royal palace. Norodom Vakrivan, the chief of protocol, was killed instantly when he opened the package. Sihanouk's parents, Suramarit and Kossamak, who were sitting in another room not far from Vakrivan, narrowly escaped unscathed. An investigation traced the origin of the <b>parcel</b> <b>bomb</b> to an American military base in Saigon. While Sihanouk publicly accused Ngo Dinh Nhu of masterminding the bomb attack, he secretly suspected that the US was also involved. The incident deepened his distrust of the US.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of poor health, Suramarit, Sihanouk's father, died on 3April 1960 which Sihanouk blamed upon the shock {{that his father had}} {{received}} from the <b>parcel</b> <b>bomb</b> attack. The following day, the royal throne council met to choose Monireth as regent. Over the next two months, Sihanouk introduced constitutional amendments to create the new post of Head of State of Cambodia, which provided ceremonial powers equivalent to that of the king. A referendum held on 5June 1960 approved Sihanouk's proposals, and Sihanouk was formally appointed Head of State on 14June 1960. As the head of state, Sihanouk took over various ceremonial responsibilities of the king, such as holding public audiences and leading the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. At the same time, he continued to play an active role in politics as Sangkum's leader.|$|E

The package arrived almost {{one year to the}} day after Alexander Rubowitz had disappeared, but Roy Farran was away and the explosion killed Francis Rex Farran, his younger brother. The bomb was sent by a Lehi cell in Britain led by Yaakov Heruti, who had personally assembled it.

50|$|Ibrahim is {{suspected}} of being the main explosives expert for Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the bombmaker responsible for building the bombs in the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot.

Evidence suggested the same person constructed both the Yemen <b>parcel</b> <b>bombs</b> and the device worn by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian who attempted to ignite the Christmas Day bomb on a plane in 2009. One of the detonators was nearly identical to the one used in the Christmas Day attack.|$|R

25|$|In June 1958, the ARVN were {{involved}} in border clashes with Cambodia and made gains in the northeastern Cambodian province of Stung Treng. This provoked a war of words between Diệm and Sihanouk. On 31 August 1959, Nhu failed {{in an attempt to}} assassinate Sihanouk. He ordered his agents to send <b>parcel</b> <b>bombs</b> to the Cambodian leader. Two suitcases were delivered to the Sihanouks' palace, one addressed to the head of state, and the other to Prince Vakrivan, his head of protocol. The deliveries were labeled as originating from an American engineer who had previously worked in Cambodia and purported to contain gifts from Hong Kong. Sihanouk's package contained a bomb, but the other did not; however, Vakrivan opened both on behalf of the monarch and was killed instantly, as was a servant. The explosion happened adjacent to a room in the palace where Sihanouk's parents were present. At the same time, anti-Sihanouk broadcasts emanated from a secret transmitter located somewhere in South Vietnam, widely attributed to Nhu. Sihanouk quickly blamed the Ngôs and his aides made statements implying the United States might {{have played a role in}} the assassination attempt.|$|R
40|$|A close-range blast event {{can cause}} severe damage to {{building}} structures {{due to its}} ability to produce very high localised impulsive loads. Such events can result from explosives that {{are attached to the}} critical elements of a structure, backpack and suitcase explosives, and vehicle or <b>parcel</b> <b>bombs</b> targeting the key structural elements of buildings and bridges. Steel hollow sections are among the most commonly used prefabricated structural element types that are widely used in Australia. Therefore, adopting the necessary precautionary measures in the design of such elements against close-range blast is worthwhile to explore. This paper focuses on an experimental and numerical study performed on concrete-filled and hollow square tubular columns (100 x 5 mm SHS Grade C 350) made out of cold-formed structural steel hollow sections (SHS) that were subjected to highly explosive TNT charges. The charges were placed above the top surface of the column at two different scaled standoff distances of 0. 12 m/kg 1 / 3 and 0. 15 m/kg 1 / 3. The failure mechanism and the pressure development of the hollow and concrete-filled columns are discussed and presented. The advantages of using concrete as an infill material for reducing the structural damage are also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Neil Lennon {{was subject}} to a terror campaign. In January he, along with two other Northern Irish, Catholic, Celtic players Niall McGinn and Paddy McCourt, were sent {{packages}} containing bullets in the post. In March and April two <b>parcel</b> <b>bombs</b> were sent to high-profile fans of Celtic and two bombs were sent to Lennon. Trish Godman MSP and Paul McBride QC, who had represented Celtic in their court cases with the SFA, were both sent bombs through the Royal Mail. All of the devices were addressed to their places of work. The bombs, described by Strathclyde Police as being designed to [...] "kill or maim", were widely condemned by footballing and political authorities. Scottish Labour leader, Iain Gray, described the act as [...] "terrorism" [...] and First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond said that, [...] "It is time to remember what we value in society, and unite to condemn those who use football as a pretext for their pathetic and dangerous prejudices." [...] Lennon {{and his family had}} to receive 24-hour police protection because of the bombs and threats. He also had to receive police protection at matches due to the threats against him. However, this did not stop a man at a match against Hearts at Tynecastle running onto the pitch and attacking him. Lennon was uninjured, and the man was charged with assault and breach of the peace, both aggravated by religious prejudice.|$|R
