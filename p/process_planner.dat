40|$|Design {{engineers}} and <b>process</b> <b>planners</b> need {{to search for}} similar designs. Design engineers use similar designs to estimate a new design’s manufacturability. Like <b>process</b> <b>planners,</b> who need to generate process plans before production begins, design engineers can use an existing, similar design’s process plan {{to create a new}} process plan. Then, they can evaluate the new design. Variant process planning, a common process planning approach, uses a design similarity measure to identify the most similar design and retrieve a useful process plan. However, standard design similarity measures do not explicitly consider the production process. This paper presents an approach for developing a new class of plan-based design similarity measures. Such a measure explicitly exploits process plan similarity and thus improves the variant process planning approach. An example illustrates the approach and compares the new measure and a traditional group technology code-based approach.

40|$|Most {{existing}} {{approaches to}} computer aided process planning aim for full automation by {{searching for a}} plan that is optimal {{with respect to a}} pre-speci ed objective function. Such full automation is often infeasible in practice for three reasons: (i) the search space of potential plans is huge, (ii) optimality metrics are often context sensitive and can only be elicited through user interaction, (iii) because of the importance of process planning, organizations are more interested in process planning assistants that support human expert <b>process</b> <b>planners</b> rather than standalone <b>process</b> <b>planners.</b> In this paper, we present a planner's assistant&quot;, which helps the human process planning experts in coming up with process plans.

The tasks performed {{by each of}} the providers or the planner are often NP-complete, e. g. the Traveling Salesman Problem. Therefore, finding a combined solution is a computationally (as well as conceptually) complex task.

The main challenge is a high level of uncertainty and that each module can be described in a different language. The language is determined by its suitability for the task and the expertise of the local developers. To allow for multiple languages, we approach the problem of finding combined solutions model-theoretically. We describe a knowledge representation formalism for representing such systems and then demonstrate how to use it for representing a business <b>process</b> <b>planner.</b> We prove correctness of our representation, describe general properties of modular systems and ideas for how to automate finding solutions. ...|$|E

By the responding companies 32 % do not use any CAM system and only 2 % use a PLM system. On the other side of the spectrum is a group of 25 % that uses CAM in 75 % or more of their planned products.

40|$|Feature-based process {{planning}} has been popular in academia and industry owing to its ability rigorously to integrate design and manufacturing. In {{spite of this}} benefit, feature-based {{process planning}} {{has been difficult to}} implement because {{it is not easy to}} extract even simple features from the design data automatically and efficiently. Furthermore, it is even more difficult to construct the temporal precedence relationships among the extracted features with regard to plan alternatives and sequence options.

An elaborated process plan created by a CAPP or an experienced <b>process</b> <b>planner</b> should be validated with respect to various validation criteria, such as the shape of a finished part, feature interaction, feature interference, feature manufacturability and flexibility for shop floor control.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of computer integrated manufacturing (CIM), which strives to integrate all manufacturing functions into a unified platform of informational and computational resources, the function of process planning (or the <b>process</b> <b>planner)</b> is prominent. It has been stated that CIM, to a large extent, {{is the result of}} automating process planning going from computer aided design (CAD) to computer aided manufacturing (CAM). Certain variables of the complex task of process planning are viewed as mapping functions between design features and related machining strategies. Once a machining feature is identified, decision variables are defined in terms of a set of most relevant input variables pertaining to part description and related to the equipment capabilities. For the machinist (or <b>process</b> <b>planner),</b> this is a decision making process. For automation this is a mapping process reducing to an implicit relationship between process variables providing the decision processor the capability to capture vagueness in a real world situation. For the human this is a result of situational experience that results in the domain expertise or knowledge set. For automation this requires solicitation, documentation and automation of machining knowledge, and a knowledge processor that yields a useful result.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 50 years, {{there have been}} many {{significant}} enhancements in computer aided systems which have influenced the CNC technology. One area that can be considered as a bottleneck to these CNC enhancements, and in particular to interoperability in CNC manufacturing is G&M part programming (ISO 6983). To overcome this bottleneck, the new standard ISO 14649, known as STEP-NC, is being developed to provide detailed information on component design, process planning and machining strategies to manufacture parts {{for the next generation of}} intelligent CNCs. This standard forms the basis of a new paradigm shift in the CNC domain to support digital modelling of CNC manufacturing resources. The research in this paper aims to identify major issues and develop new software tools to demonstrate the feasibility of interoperable CNC manufacturing based on STEP-NC. Besides the literature review on recent research and development on STEP-NC, this paper proposes a Process Planning System (PPS) with surface roughness chosen as the process planning objective.
