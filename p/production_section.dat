40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} systematic methodology for cost-effective thermal integration of <b>production</b> plant <b>sections</b> and the utility system of an industrial site. A <b>production</b> plant <b>section</b> is a subprocess of a production process that transforms materials into intermediate or end products. A production process is built up from a group of these sections or sub-processes linked together in a logical way. Typically a central utility system provides the utilities that the <b>production</b> <b>sections</b> need. The methodology developed in this thesis can analyze and optimize the energy system of this kind of total site.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an approach to}} designing a large-scale water system, which integrates water-using operations and wastewater treatment units in different <b>production</b> <b>sections</b> within the same network. This approach uses a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for water reuse and regeneration reuse in batch and semicontinuous processes. The application of this mathematical formulation to large-scale industrial problems with changing daily production schedule leads to huge and complex mathematical models. Two alternative multilevel strategies are proposed to solve such problems by means of temporal decomposition. The approach is illustrated with a brewery case study that integrates water consumers in two <b>production</b> <b>sections.</b> The results obtained show that, despite the high piping cost, integration of both sections yields better result than the separate water network design in each section. © 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{structure}} of running coupling corrections to the gluon <b>production</b> cross <b>section</b> in the projectile-nucleus collisions calculated in the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework. We argue that for the gluon <b>production</b> cross <b>section</b> (and for gluon transverse momentum spectra and multiplicity) the inclusion of running coupling corrections brings in collinear singularities due to final state splittings completely unaffected by CGC resummations. Hence, despite the saturation/CGC dynamics, the gluon <b>production</b> cross <b>section</b> is not infrared-safe. As usual, regularizing the singularities requires an infrared cutoff Lambda_coll that defines a resolution scale for gluons. We specifically show that the cutoff enters the gluon <b>production</b> cross <b>section</b> in the argument of the strong coupling constant alpha_s(Lambda_coll^ 2). We argue that for hadron production calculations one {{should be able to}} absorb the collinear divergence into a fragmentation function. The singular collinear terms in the gluon <b>production</b> cross <b>section</b> are shown not to contribute to the energy density of the produced matter, which is indeed an infrared-finite quantity.

The graviton <b>production</b> cross <b>section</b> in a lead-lead collision is enhanced in comparison to a pp collision at LHC depending upon the minimum transverse energy of the jet E_{T,jet}^{min} above which the graviton <b>production</b> cross <b>section</b> is computed.

5000|$|The book's {{full title}} is Recording The Beatles: The Studio Equipment and Techniques Used To Create Their Classic Albums. It {{addresses}} the technical side of The Beatles' sessions and was written {{with the assistance}} of many of the group's former engineers and technicians, chief among them Peter K. Burkowitz, designer of the REDD mixing console. The book looks at every piece of recording equipment used at Abbey Road Studios during the Beatles' sessions, including all microphones, outboard gear, mixing consoles, speakers, and tape machines. Each piece is examined in great detail, and the book is illustrated with hundreds of full color photographs, charts, drawings and illustrations. How the equipment was implemented during the group's sessions is also covered. The effects used on the Beatles' records are addressed in great detail, with full explanations of concepts such as ADT and flanging. The <b>Production</b> <b>section</b> of the book looks at the group's recording processes chronologically, starting with their [...] "artist test" [...] in 1962 and progressing through to their final session in 1970.

50|$|Another {{controversy}} {{is that although}} assistants and other editorial staff work on the picture {{from the first day}} of shooting to the last day of mixing, they appear almost {{at the end of the}} credit roll. They may be on the film for a year or more, yet be placed way behind someone else who worked on the set for a day. The reason for this placement goes back to the early days of film. For much of film's history, credit rolls were not as long as they are now. The tradition established was to list persons in order that they contributed to the film. But about thirty years ago, credit rolls began to grow greatly in length. They may last up to ten minutes now. Assistants appear chronologically in the post-production section, about eight minutes into such a roll. By contrast, a set PA, who may have worked only for a short time, would appear in the <b>production</b> <b>section,</b> about four minutes in. Picture editors, who have front end credit (at the head of the film or head of the credit roll) are not affected. Recently, the Motion Picture Editors Guild issued a letter to producers, asking that they move their editorial staffs up the credit roll. Owing to strong traditions in studio film policy, and habit, not many features have volunteered to move their editing staffs up.|$|E
