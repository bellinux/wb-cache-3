25|$|In {{spite of}} Can-Car's success in other markets, {{as early as}} 1981 the {{government}} had considered selling UTDC to the private sector. Their concern was that without a manufacturing business, UTDC would {{find it difficult to}} make enough income to justify its Kingston operations. If the company did start a manufacturing side, it would be inappropriate for the company to remain government owned. The Can-Car deal <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>on</b> hold for a time.|$|E
500|$|... "The hope, {{first and}} foremost, was to <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>on</b> people’s radar. Apart from the UN {{and a few}} newsreaders who mention this every year, people don’t even know this day exists. It’s also to make people realize it’s not just about {{volunteering}} to go {{and live in the}} Congo for four years. It’s as much about working a soup kitchen as it is helping an elderly person. Contributing something positive doesn’t have to be a lifelong commitment; it can just be daily gestures. So, it was about giving the whole issue perspective... One video and a message aren't going to save everything. But when you say things together, maybe the message will be heard and hopefully will provoke action. Inherently people are good, and inherently people are distracted and somewhat lazy, so it comes down to how do you get people’s attention." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, audio leaked of Spears {{singing the}} song without pitch correction. James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph noted that Spears struggles to project {{her voice and}} reach the song's high notes. Critics {{described}} Spears' vocal performance in the leaked track as [...] "flat at best and, at worst, like a strangled cat", [...] "noticeably off-key", [...] "unpolished [...] unflattering", [...] "diabolical", [...] "a style that might kindly be described as tentative", and [...] "toxic to the ears". CNN defended the track, saying that its quality is irrelevant as Spears is not known for her vocal ability. Orbit claimed that the audio was a vocal warm up, {{not expected to be}} a take, and not intended to be heard by the public, adding, [...] "Whomever <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>on</b> the internet must have done so in a spirit of unkindness, but it can in no way detract from the fact that Britney is and always will be beyond stellar! She is magnificent! And that’s that." ...|$|E

500|$|When Bowden gives Dussander an SS uniform to {{wear and}} in which to march under Bowden's orders, the student's demands are more {{heightened}} in the film as [...] "more dominant and voyeuristic", according to Picart and Frank. Bowden tells Dussander, [...] "I tried to do this the nice way, but you don't want it. So fine, we'll do this the hard way. You will <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>on,</b> because I {{want to see you}} in it. Now move!" [...] The editing style of the Nazi march scene juxtaposes Dussander marching in the uniform and Bowden reacting to the march. Shots of Bowden's reaction are from a low angle, which reflects [...] "the sexual difference between the characters"; Bowden is masculinized as [...] "the bearer of the [...] gaze", and Dussander is feminized as [...] "the object of the gaze". The cutting between Bowden and Dussander [...] "corroborates a homoerotic arrangement of images" [...] which visualizes the latent homoeroticism of the scene from the novella. When Dussander speeds up his march and Bowden tells him to stop, the sped-up shot reverse shot [...] "radically [...] the structure of power", where Bowden loses [...] "control of his sadistic power over Dussander".|$|E
500|$|In July 2010 Deutsche Bahn (DB) {{announced}} that it intended to make a test run with a high-speed ICE-3MF train through the Channel Tunnel in October 2010 in preparation for possible future operations. The trial ran on 19 October 2010 with a Class 406 ICE train specially liveried with a British [...] "Union flag" [...] decal. The train was then put on display for the press at St Pancras International. However, {{this is not the}} class of train that would be used for the proposed service. At the St Pancras ceremony, DB revealed that it planned to operate from London to Frankfurt and Amsterdam (two of the biggest air travel markets in Europe), with trains 'splitting & joining' in Brussels. It hoped to begin these services in 2013 using Class 407 ICE units, with three trains per day each way—morning, midday and afternoon. Initially the only calling points would be Rotterdam on the way to Amsterdam, and Cologne on the way to Frankfurt. Amsterdam and Cologne would be under four hours from London, Frankfurt around five hours. DB decided to <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>on</b> hold mainly due to advance passport check requirements. DB had hoped that immigration checks could be done on board, but British authorities required immigration and security checks to be done at Lille Europe station, taking at least 30 minutes.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN {{gave the}} episode an 8.4/10 {{saying it was}} [...] "Impressive" [...] and [...] "With or without the timeliness {{of the story and}} setting, 'Boy Meets Curl' was a fast and funny episode certain to be a highlight of the season". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, the best grade of the night, saying [...] "Simpsons was one of their best episodes in a long time, and it continues a season that's had some pretty good episodes overall. I wouldn't <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>on</b> The Simpsons' top tier, but I think it's definitely on that next tier down, episodes that maybe don't have the most original plots but do have solid jokes throughout. Even the Bart and Lisa B-plot, involving Lisa getting a sudden addiction to Olympic pin collecting, starts out kind of bland and gets better and better as Lisa's jones grows." [...] Jason Hughes of the TV Squad gave the episode a positive review as well saying [...] "All in all, it was a weird time out of Springfield this week, with some highlight moments sprinkled throughout". Steve Tilley of the Toronto Sun wrote [...] "Sure, the episode was probably funnier for Canadians and curlers (and maybe Harry Potter fans) than anyone else, but it did prove Homer has got a bit of meteorological, psychic in him: 'Pack your winter coat, we're going to Canada's warmest city!'" ...|$|E

This, and the other public displays of accused criminals, was criticized by foreign observers and some Iraqi officials. [...] "It is a crime to <b>put</b> <b>this</b> <b>on</b> television" [...] {{said one of the}} latter. [...] "It is a shame, and it is a legacy of the former dictator." [...] Security officials responded that they were trying to assure the Iraqi public that they were actively working to protect them and apprehend terrorists.
