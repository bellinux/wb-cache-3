40|$|Abstract. To develop novel biocomposites, three {{different}} silk-fibroin fabrics (<b>plain</b> <b>woven</b> fabric, <b>plain</b> weft-knit fabric and non-woven fabric) were, respectively, blended with poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) by a solution blending method. The effects of various fabric structures on the mechanical and microstructure properties of silk-fibroin fabric reinforced (SF-fabric-reinforced) PCL biocomposites were investigated. It {{was obvious that}} the breaking strength and elongation of SF-fabric-reinforced PCL biocomposites decreased while the Young’s modulus increased. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) photographs showed that silk-fibroin fabrics were well bonded with PCL matrix. From Wide-Angle X-ray Diffraction (WXRD) analysis, <b>plain</b> <b>woven</b> and <b>plain</b> weft-knit fabrics showed higher ability to increase the crystallinity of PCL matrix compared with non-woven fabric...|$|R

40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{have studied the}} bending rigidity of woven fabrics in various directions, {{but there have been}} no reports on anisotropy in bending hysteresis. In this work, existing models for predicting the bending rigidity of woven fabrics are applied to bending hysteresis in various directions. A wide range of cotton <b>plain</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics is examined by comparing theoretical data with experimental results. The results show that Cooper's model is the most reliable in predicting polar diagrams of bending hysteresis in cotton <b>plain</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics. The results also indicate that the shape of polar diagrams of bending hysteresis along the weft direction spreads outward with an increase in the ratio V introduced by Cooper.

The strain mapping technique clearly revealed the strain concentrations near the singularity. The strain concentrations are influenced by the tensile loading direction and the hole dimension relative {{to the size of the}} unit cell of the <b>plain</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics. A preliminary comparison of stresses approximately calculated from the strain field and theoretical stresses calculated from existing models such as Lekhnitskii's model is also presented.

From these points of view, the proposed simulation method is very useful for the estimation of material damping properties...|$|R
