500|$|The I-5 was a single-seat biplane with {{staggered}} {{wings in}} a sesquiplane configuration with fixed landing gear and a tailskid. The aircraft was of mixed construction, with the fuselage being {{made of a}} framework of welded steel tubes covered by a fabric skin over the rear fuselage, with the front fuselage section being covered by detachable duralumin panels {{as far back as}} the rear of the cockpit. There were also detachable panels allowing easy access to the tailskid shock absorber. The fabric skin was laced for tightness and the seams were covered with calico. A fireproof bulkhead separated the [...] fuel tank from the engine and a fire extinguisher was fitted with outlets to the fuel <b>pump,</b> <b>inlet</b> pipe and carburetor. The conventional landing gear was connected by a one-piece axle and some aircraft were fitted with teardrop-shaped spats covering the wheels. Initially the tailskid was fixed, but later aircraft had smaller skids that moved in concert with the rudder. Rubber rings were used as shock absorbers on the landing gear.|$|E

50|$|Effect of precession. When {{the piston}} {{is at the}} top of the {{reciprocation}} cycle (commonly referred to as top-dead-center or just TDC), the connection between the trapped fluid chamber and the pump's discharge port is closed. Shortly thereafter, that same chamber becomes open to the <b>pump's</b> <b>inlet</b> port. As the piston continues to precess about the cylinder block axis, it moves away from the valve plate thereby increasing the volume of the trapped chamber. As this occurs, fluid enters the chamber from the <b>pump's</b> <b>inlet</b> to fill the void. This process continues until the piston reaches the bottom of the reciprocation cylinder - commonly referred to as bottom-dead-center or BDC. At BDC, the connection between the <b>pumping</b> chamber and <b>inlet</b> port is closed. Shortly thereafter, the chamber becomes open to the discharge port again and the pumping cycle starts over.|$|R
2500|$|The AAIB {{issued a}} further {{bulletin}} on 12 May 2008 which {{confirmed that the}} investigation continued to focus on fuel delivery. It stated that [...] "The reduction in thrust on both engines {{was the result of}} a reduced fuel flow and all engine parameters after the thrust reduction were consistent with this." [...] The report confirmed that the fuel was of good quality and had a freezing point below the coldest temperatures encountered, appearing to rule out fuel freezing as a cause. As in the aforementioned February bulletin, the report noted cavitation damage to the high-pressure fuel pumps of both engines, indicative of abnormally low pressure at the <b>pump</b> <b>inlets.</b> After ruling out fuel freezing or contamination, the investigation then focused on what caused the low pressure at the <b>pump</b> <b>inlets.</b> [...] "Restrictions in the fuel system between the aircraft fuel tanks and each of the engine HP pumps, resulting in reduced fuel flows, is suspected." [...] The fuel delivery system was being investigated at Boeing, and the engines at manufacturer Rolls Royce in Derby.|$|R
40|$|The AEMU Thermal Loop Pump Development Specification {{establishes}} {{the requirements for}} design, performance, and testing of the Water Pump {{as part of the}} Thermal System of the Advanced Portable Life Support System (PLSS). It is envisioned that the Thermal Loop Pump is a positive displacement pump that provides a repeatable volume of flow against a given range of back-pressures provided by the various applications. The intention is to operate the pump at a fixed speed for the given application. The primary system is made up of two identical and redundant pumps of which only one is in operation at given time. The Auxiliary Loop Pump is an identical pump design to the primary pumps but is operated at half the flow rate. Inlet positive pressure to the pumps is provided by the upstream Flexible Supply Assembly (FSA- 431 and FSA- 531) which are physically located inside the suit volume and pressurized by suit pressure. An integrated relief valve, placed in parallel to the <b>pump's</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet protects the pump and loop from over-pressurization. An integrated course filter is placed upstream of the <b>pump's</b> <b>inlet</b> to provide filtration and prevent potential debris from damaging the pump...|$|R

50|$|Thermodynamic pump {{testing is}} a form of pump testing where only the {{temperature}} rise, power consumed, and differential pressure need to be measured to find the efficiency of a pump. These measurements are typically made with insertion temperature probes and pressure probes fitted to tapping points on the <b>pump's</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet. From these measurements, the flow produced by a pump can be derived. The thermodynamic method was developed in the early 1960s, and since has been increasingly used.

In addition, the relative effectiveness of three suppressor locations (the low pressure <b>pump</b> (LWOP) <b>inlet</b> and discharge and the high pressure <b>pump</b> (HPOP) <b>inlet)</b> is also evaluated. The primary conclusion of the study is that effective pogo suppression, with passive devices, can be accomplished at the HPOP inlet location but not at the LPOP locations. Other conclusions are drawn regarding the relative effectiveness of the two accumulator types and with respect to tentative accumulator design requirements. Finally, a number of recommendations are made regarding future studies...|$|R

It was raised two days later by the floating crane Titan and laid up while investigations into the sinking took place.

40|$|The {{progressing}} {{cavity pump}} {{is a type}} of positive displacement pump that is capable of moving nearly any fluid. This type of pump transports fluids in a series of discrete cavities formed by the helical geometries of its rigid rotor and elastomeric stator. With appropriate materials for the rotor and stator, this pump can move combinations of liquids, suspended solids, and gasses equally well. Because of its versatility, the progressing cavity pump is widely used in the oil industry to transport mixtures of oil, water, and sediment; this investigation was prompted by a desire to extend the use of progressing cavity pumps to wet gas pumping applications. One of the progressing cavity pump's limitations is that the friction between the rotor and stator can generate enough heat to damage the rotor if the pump is not lubricated and cooled by the process fluid. Conventional wisdom dictates that this type of pump will overheat if it pumps only gas, with no liquid in the process fluid. If a progressing cavity pump is used to boost the output from a wet gas well, it could potentially be damaged if the well's output is too dry {{for an extended period of}} time. This project seeks to determine how a progressing cavity pump behaves when operating at gas volume fractions between 0. 90 and 0. 98. A progressing cavity pump manufactured by seepex, model no. BN 130 - 12, is tested at half and full speed using air-water mixtures with gas volume fractions of 0. 90, 0. 92, 0. 94, 0. 96, and 0. 98. The <b>pump's</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet conditions are controlled to produce suction pressures of 15, 30, and 45 psi and outlet pressures 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 psi higher than the inlet pressure. A series of thermocouples, pressure transducers, and turbine flow meters measures the <b>pump's</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet conditions, the flow rates of water and air entering the pump, and pressures and temperatures at four positions within the pump's stator. Over all test conditions, the maximum recorded temperature of the pump stator did not exceed the maximum safe rubber temperature specified by the manufacturer. The pump?s flow rate is independent of both the fluid's gas volume fraction and the pressure difference across the pump, but it increases slightly with the pump's suction pressure. The pump's mechanical load, however, is dependent only on the pressure difference across the pump and increases linearly with that parameter. Pressure measurements within the stator demonstrated that the leakage between the pump's cavities increases with the fluids gas volume fraction, indicating that liquid inside the pump improves its sealing capability. However, those same measurements failed to detect any appreciable leakage between the two pressure taps nearest the <b>pump's</b> <b>inlet.</b> This last observation suggests that the pump could be shortened by as much as 25 percent without losing any performance in the range of tested conditions; shortening the pump should increase its efficiency by decreasing its frictional mechanical load...|$|R
50|$|Use of {{a parking}} orbit {{requires}} a rocket upper stage {{to perform the}} injection burn while under zero g conditions. Often, the same upper stage which performs the parking orbit injection {{is used for the}} final injection burn, which requires use of a restartable liquid-propellant rocket engine. During the parking orbit coast, the propellants will drift away {{from the bottom of the}} tank and the <b>pump</b> <b>inlets.</b> This must be dealt with through the use of tank diaphragms, or ullage rockets to settle the propellant back to the bottom of the tank. A reaction control system is needed to orient the stage properly for the final burn, and perhaps to establish a suitable thermal orientation during coast. Cryogenic propellants must be stored in well-insulated tanks, to prevent excessive boiloff during coast. Battery life and other consumables must be sufficient for the duration of the parking coast and final injection.|$|R

50|$|Continuous or quasi-continuous {{monitoring}} involves {{having an}} automated analytical facility {{close to the}} environment being monitored so that results can, if required, be viewed in real time. Such systems are often established to protect important water supplies {{such as in the}} River Dee regulation system but may also be part of an overall monitoring strategy on large strategic rivers where early warning of potential problems is essential. Such systems routinely provide data on parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity and colour but it is also possible to operate gas liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry technologies (GLC/MS) to examine a wide range of potential organic pollutants. In all examples of automated bank-side analysis there is a requirement for water to be pumped from the river into the monitoring station. Choosing a location for the <b>pump</b> <b>inlet</b> is equally as critical as deciding on the location for a river grab sample. The design of the pump and pipework also requires careful design to avoid artefacts being introduced through the action of pumping the water. Dissolved oxygen concentration is difficult to sustain through a pumped system and GLC/MS facilities can detect micro-organic contaminants from the pipework and glands.|$|E
5000|$|Hydraulic {{pumps are}} used in {{hydraulic}} drive systems and can be hydrostatic or hydrodynamic.A hydraulic pump is a mechanical source of power that converts mechanical power into hydraulic energy (hydrostatic energy i.e. flow, pressure). It generates flow with enough power to overcome pressure induced by the load at the pump outlet. When a hydraulic pump operates, it creates a vacuum at the <b>pump</b> <b>inlet,</b> which forces liquid from the reservoir into the inlet line to the pump and by mechanical action delivers this liquid to the pump outlet and forces it into the hydraulic system.Hydrostatic pumps are positive displacement pumps while hydrodynamic pumps can be fixed displacement pumps, in which the displacement (flow through the pump per rotation of the pump) cannot be adjusted, or variable displacement pumps, which have a more complicated construction that allows the displacement to be adjusted. Although, hydrodynamic pumps are more frequent in day-to-day life. Hydrostatics pump which are of various types works {{on the principle of}} Pascal's law. It states that the increase in pressure at one point of the enclosed liquid in equilibrium of rest is transmitted equally to all other points of the liquid, unless the effect of gravity is neglected.(in case of statics) ...|$|E
