5000|$|... #Caption: Left palatine bone. Posterior aspect. Enlarged. (<b>Pterygopalatine</b> <b>canal</b> labeled {{at center}} left.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The lateral {{border is}} united {{with the lower}} margin of the {{perpendicular}} part, and is grooved by {{the lower end of}} the <b>pterygopalatine</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{inferior}} {{border is}} fused with the lateral {{edge of the}} horizontal part, and immediately {{in front of the}} pyramidal process is grooved by {{the lower end of the}} <b>pterygopalatine</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{greater palatine}} canal (or <b>pterygopalatine</b> <b>canal)</b> is {{a passage in}} the skull that transmits the {{descending}} palatine artery, vein, and greater and lesser palatine nerves between the pterygopalatine fossa and the oral cavity.|$|E
50|$|Branches are {{distributed}} to the gums, the palatine glands, and the mucous membrane of {{the roof of the}} mouth; while in the <b>pterygopalatine</b> <b>canal</b> it gives off twigs which descend in the lesser palatine canals to supply the soft palate and palatine tonsil, anastomosing with the ascending palatine artery.|$|E
50|$|While in the <b>pterygopalatine</b> <b>canal,</b> {{it gives}} off lateral {{posterior}} inferior nasal branches which enter {{the nasal cavity}} through openings in the palatine bone, and ramify over the inferior nasal concha and middle and inferior meatuses; at its exit from the canal, a palatine branch is distributed to both surfaces of the soft palate.|$|E
50|$|The maxillary {{surface is}} rough and {{irregular}} throughout {{the greater part}} of its extent, for articulation with the nasal surface of the maxilla; its upper and back part is smooth where it enters into the formation of the pterygopalatine fossa; it is also smooth in front, where it forms the posterior part of the medial wall of the maxillary sinus. On the posterior part of this surface is a deep vertical groove, converted into the <b>pterygopalatine</b> <b>canal,</b> by articulation with the maxilla; this canal transmits the descending palatine vessels, and the anterior palatine nerve.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{important}} foramina in the palatine bones that transmit nerves and blood vessels to this region: the greater and lesser palatine). The larger greater palatine foramen {{is located in}} the posterolateral region of each of the palatine bones, usually at the apex of the maxillary third molar. The greater palatine foramen transmits the greater palatine nerve and blood vessels. A smaller opening nearby, the lesser palatine foramen, transmits the lesser palatine nerve and blood vessels to the soft palate and tonsils. Both foramina are openings of the <b>pterygopalatine</b> <b>canal</b> that carries the descending palatine nerves and blood vessels from the pterygopalatine fossa to the palate.|$|E
