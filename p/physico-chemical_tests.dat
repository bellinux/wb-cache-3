Specifically, the research looked at physico-chemical qualities of household water, the incidence of diarrhoeal diseases and soil-transmitted helminthic infections. Thirty households were selected by the systematic random sampling technique from the three communities namely Mayera, Ashongman village and Tetegu.

40|$|The {{degree of}} mixing {{of organic matter}} with {{minerals}} in organic and hemi-organic horizons of forest soils largely differs between humus types. As clay minerals might control the mobility of radiocesium in these forest floor horizons, plant contamination could greatly vary {{with the kind of}} humus. We measured the mobility of radiocesium in the upper O, OAh and Ah horizons of three acid forest soils with three distinct humus types: eumoder, dysmoder and fibrimor. We used two different approaches: a <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>test</b> quantifying the radiocesium interception potential (RIP) and a biological assay simulating an experimental rhizosphere. The results show that the (137) Cs horizon-to-plant transfer is directly governed by RIP, and thus by frayed edge sites born by weathered micaceous minerals. The inverse relationship between RIP and organic matter content indicates that in the three sites investigated the mixing of organic residues with Cs-fixing minerals is a key process in 137 Cs mobility. These Cs-fixing clay minerals indeed decrease in the sequence eumoder > dysmoder > fibrimor because they are more diluted in forest floor with less bioturbation. Our results suggest that humus type might be an important parameter in classifying forest soils with respect to their ability to transfer radiocesium to the above standing vegetation...|$|R

Using cultures derived from neonatal chicken kidney tissue 30 cytopathic agents were recovered from domestic hens. Electron microscope examination following staining by sodium phosphotungstate showed that 25 of these agents had the morphology of adenoviruses and the remaining 5 agents were morphologically indistinguishable from reoviruses. Some selected strains of adenoviruses and reoviruses were subjected to <b>physico-chemical</b> <b>tests</b> and it was found that both groups of agents were unaffected by chloroform and the replication of adenovirus strains, but not the reovirus, was inhibited by IDU. These results provide confirmatory evidence for the identification of these agents as avian adenoviruses and reoviruses. The avian adenoviruses like the analogous mammalian agents were found to have diminished thermostability in the presence of 1. OM Ca++. Cross-neutralisation tests showed that four serologically distinct adenovirus strains were recovered and 16 of the remaining adenovirus isolates were assigned to one or other of the four serotypes. All 5 reoviruses were assigned to one serological type on the basis of neutralisation tests. A preliminary serum survey for neutralising antibody to the 4 adenovirus serotypes showed that antibody to one or more of these viruses was present in a high proportion of flocks of domestic fowl in the Manawatu district of New Zealand and antibody to two of the serotypes was particularly common. This work represents the first report of the recovery of avian adenovirus and reovirus from domestic hens in New Zealand. However their clinical and pathological significance remain to bo investigated...|$|E
40|$|Off-flavor and lipid {{oxidation}} {{are possible}} defects of irradiated bulgogi. This study compared {{the effects of}} several phys-ico-chemical treatments on microbial safety, volatiles, lipid oxidation, and sensory properties of irradiated beef bulgogi. Samples were separately irradiated with 20 kGy after each treatment such as packaging (aerobic and vacuum), antioxidants (vitamin C + α-tocopherol (0. 0 and 1. 0 %, w/w)), charcoal teabags (0 and 0. 5 %), or different temperatures (room tempera-ture,- 20, and- 70 °C). No bacterial growth was observed (p< 0. 05) after irradiation of more than 20 kGy during storage at 35 °C. Volatiles created by irradiating bulgogi were toluene, heptane, and 1, 3 -bis(1, 1 -dimethylethyl) benzene. Irradiation off-flavor, lipid oxidation, and deterioration of sensory quality induced by irradiation were effectively reduced (p< 0. 05) by all <b>physico-chemical</b> treatments <b>tested...</b>|$|R
40|$|A <b>physico-chemical</b> carcinogen-screening <b>test</b> {{was used}} to measure the rate {{constants}} of electron attachment, Jt ̂ s, of 105 chemicals that had been screened in long-term rodent bioassays and short-term in vitro tests by the NCI/NTP. In the &e test, a pulse-conductivity technique is used to generate and monitor the decay of excess electrons that serve as nucleophilk surrogates for the target tissue of rodents. Of the 61 chemicals that had been found to be rodent carcinogens as well as Salmonella mutagens, 36 yield k,s that are equal to or greater than the diffusion-controlled kt of carbon tetrachloride and are considered to be positive kt test responses. In contrast, 29 of the remaining 44 chemicals that are putative non-carcinogens and non-mutagens yield &eS that are negative k? test responses. These results are combined with the ke responses of 46 non-mutageni...|$|R
40|$|The main aspect in {{the field}} of {{pharmaceutical}} technology is the preformulation of the poorly water soluble drugs. The habit of particles can effect the physico-chemical properties which are important factors by drug administration. In the past years the role of the procedures by acustic cavitation increased {{in the field}} of particle engineering. Application of high power ultrasound by integration and dezintegration can lead to particle size decreasing. Meloxicam as a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory model drug was used to study the effect of power ultrasound on the particle size decreasing. During our work technological parameters, as amplitude, temperature, time, excipients and concentration were optimized based on particle size distribution. <b>Physico-chemical</b> stability <b>tests</b> were also performed (XRPD, DSC, SEM, particle size). With optimized parameters (70 % amplitude, 20 min, 47 °C) using excipients, crystalline micronized product was produced...|$|R
