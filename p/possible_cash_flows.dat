40|$|Offshore {{wind power}} plants {{might be seen}} as high risk investments. Their risk depends on {{technical}} and financial elements. When some corporations decide to invest in a plant, they decide to take all above-mentioned risks. The question “Given a specific investor, a specific plant, etc., how big are the investment risks?” has not a clear answer. In fact, the impact of the previous risk factors on cash flows is not completely quantified, mainly because all the risks are related, but the dependency structure is difficult to be modelled. Hence, {{it is important to have}} a measure of the impact of the risks into the cash flows. Due to the lack of knowledge in this quantification, we have decided to investigate it more in the detail. The paper aims to measure the variability of cash flows and how effective are the strategies for locking electricity prices, ship freight rates, or both in the reduction of this variability. We adopt the Monte Carlo approach for simulating all the <b>possible</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and for measuring all the uncertainties. The output shows that seasonal and uncertain cash flows. The strategies, for reducing the probability of negative cash flows, work only with locked electricity prices...|$|E
40|$|Cash flow {{forecasts}} are {{the most}} important step in the capital budgeting process in terms of planning effectively to finance for cash deficit and invest cash surplus for capital expenditure decisions. Despite its importance, little {{progress has been made in}} its estimation process, due to the difficulty of producing accurate cash flow numbers for the analysis of capital budgeting decisions. This management project details the investigation of the cash flow forecasts practices and highlights some of the challenges in such forecasts. The cash flow forecasts practices have been investigated in an exploratory and explanatory study that has captured qualitative data about the considerations of the practices to improve the level of estimation accuracy. A total of 4 respondents from financial institution, with different levels of cash flow forecasting experience, participated in the questionnaire study. The results indicate that other than considering the relevant cash flow information into cash flow forecasts, there are other factors to be considered to experience a higher level of accuracy in such forecasts. The accuracy improves when the financial institution generates detailed cash flow forecasts for relatively smaller capital expenditures. In the case of more complex capital expenditure proposals, the financial institution used a range of estimates to evaluate different <b>possible</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> pictures when making capital expenditure decisions. Furthermore, multiple forecasting methods, both quantitative and qualitative forecasting methods are used to incorporate risks and uncertainty in forecasting capital expenditure cash flows. Finally, there are different perceived importance factors, such as financial, marketing and production in the estimation process of cash flow forecasts. These results suggest that the cash flow forecasting process or practices are very important in generating accurate cash flow forecasts. It is believed that this investigation and other similar studies will help provide the basis to achieve a higher level of accuracy in generating cash flow forecasts...|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This thesis presents an approach for company valuation by a replication portfolio of traded assets in discrete time. The model allows us to value companies with an uncertain <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> stream without having to revert to any discount rates including premia. Modelling of asset values can be achieved in two steps: (i) Choosing a suitable stochastic process and calibrating its parameters to fit the historical asset time series behaviour, and (ii) generating a state space transition graph to implement the stochastic process dynamics in discrete time. For company valuation, a selected number of "assets" (economic, financial, and other factors) should be captured that may reasonably be assumed to influence future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of the company. Each vertex of the transition graph represents a "state of the world" and is accompanied with a corresponding <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> caused by the sales (or other company activities) at that vertex.

Previous research conducted in the United States has provided inconsistency in the results of investigating accounting data, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and accrual accounting data in predicting future <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> No published research has studied <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> prediction in Thailand. The current study investigates the ability of accrual and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> accounting data to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of Thai listed companies. Three regression models are constructed namely earnings, <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> accrual components and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> models. In addition, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> ratios are investigated to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> by using a stepwise regression. Data used in this study is collected from the financial statements of non-financial companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand from 1994 to 2002. <b>Cash</b> <b>flow</b> data are selected directly from the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> statements. The empirical results show that past earnings, <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and accrual component of earnings can be used to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of Thai listed companies and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> have better predictive power than past earnings.

40|$|Abstract: Competitive edge is a {{multifaceted}} problem for any construction company. One {{of the problems}} is that evaluation of competitiveness has to be an important phase in selecting the subcontractor for state or municipal contract. This will both reduce risks and improve efficiency of state investment. This view on the problem of competitiveness evaluation is rather new and its solution can be made {{within the framework of the}} cost-oriented approach. We suggest that the focus should be made on the structure of the construction company’s assets that ensures the necessary <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volume for fulfilling the state municipal contract. The first step should be the analysis of that structure and searching the possibilities to optimize it along the criterion of maximizing the <b>possible</b> changes of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> as a result of transactions with some assets. The next part of the investigation describes the procedures for evaluating the influence of the environment. Coefficients of liquidity and risk are used for that. If the coefficient of liquidity is used in its classical form, then the coefficient of risk is defined as the relationship between the assets value of the construction organization and the cost of the construction-assembly works on the contract. In the conclusions of the investigation, alternative target functions are formulated that make it possible to carry out mathematical modeling the processes of improving the competitiveness of a construction company.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{volatility}} of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> from operations affects debt financing and accounts payable using {{a sample of}} Italian listed firms. Firms with different levels of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> were also examined. We find that firms that have more <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volatility have lower long-term debt to total debt, whatever the average level of their <b>cash</b> <b>flow.</b> We also show that accounts payable is positively associated with <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volatility, in particular for firms with {{a higher level of}} <b>cash</b> <b>flow.</b> Lastly, research findings reveal that firm leverage as measured by the total debt to assets ratio is negatively associated with <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volatility when firms have a lower level of <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> while the same relationship was not found for firms with a higher <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> level...|$|R
