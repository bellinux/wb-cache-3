40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{poverty in}} the United States from 1960 through 2005. We investigate how poverty rates and <b>poverty</b> <b>gaps</b> have changed over time, explore how these trends differ across family types, contrast these trends for several different income and consumption measures of poverty, and consider explanations for the differences in trends. We document sharp differences, particularly in recent years, between different income poverty measures, and between income and consumption <b>poverty</b> rates and <b>gaps.</b> Moving from the official pre-tax money income measure to a disposable income measure that incorporates taxes and transfers has a substantial effect on poverty rate changes {{over the past two}} decades. Furthermore, consumption poverty rates often indicate large declines, even in recent years when income poverty rates have risen. We show that bias in the CPI-U has a sizable effect on changes in poverty. Between the early 1960 s and 2005, an income poverty measure that corrects for bias in this price index declines by 14 percentage points more than a comparable measure based on the CPI-U. The patterns are very different across family types, with consumption poverty falling much faster than income poverty for single parents and the elderly, but more slowly for married couples with children. Income and consumption measures of deep <b>poverty</b> and <b>poverty</b> <b>gaps</b> have generally moved sharply in opposite directions {{in the last two decades}} with income deep <b>poverty</b> and <b>poverty</b> <b>gaps</b> rising, but consumption deep <b>poverty</b> and <b>poverty</b> <b>gaps</b> falling. While relative poverty rose in the early 1980 s, changes in relative poverty have been fairly small since 1990. We examine the role that demographics, taxes, and transfers play in explaining changes in poverty over the past three decades. We also consider whether measurement error, saving and dissaving, and other explanations can account for income and consumption differences. ...|$|R

The analysis is based upon an extension of dominance methods for ordering poverty, recently developed statistical inference procedures, and a merged data-set that permits an unusually comprehensive measure of income. The comparative effectiveness of the Food Stamp Program in reducing headcount poverty over time is contingent on the poverty line selected.

50|$|<b>Poverty</b> <b>gap</b> index {{ignores the}} effect of {{inequality}} between the poor. It does not capture differences in the severity of poverty amongst the poor. As a theoretical example, consider two small neighborhoods where just two households each are below the official poverty line of US$ 500 income per year. In one case, household 1 has an income of US$100 per year and household 2 has an income of US$300 per year. In second case, the two households both have annual income of US$200 per year. The <b>poverty</b> <b>gap</b> index for both cases is same (60%), even though the first case has one household, with US$100 per year income, experiencing a more severe state of poverty.
