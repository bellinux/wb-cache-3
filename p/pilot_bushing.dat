25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique <b>pilot</b> <b>bushing</b> made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore factors that affect the decision making of <b>bush</b> <b>pilots</b> who fly in the Outback Australia. To date, the findings and theories of how pilots make decisions have predominantly been based around large-scale commercial operations. Only a small number of studies have identified factors that affect the decision making of <b>bush</b> <b>Pilots</b> flying small commercial operations. These previous studies have predominantly focused on Alaskan pilots and no studies have considered <b>bush</b> <b>pilots</b> in Australia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve pilots aged between 24 and 63 years. Participants were asked to discuss their experiences of flying in the Australian Outback. Factors that affected pilots’ decision making were extracted from the transcripts using a thematic analysis technique. Factors that affected Australian Outback pilots’ decision making could be categorized into three main themes; organizational, social, and personal factors. Broad similarities exist between these factors and those that affect the decision making of pilots in Alaska, although some unique factors could be identified. This study builds on the literature of factors that can influence the flight-related decision of <b>bush</b> <b>pilots</b> and is the first study to examine this topic in an Australian context. Gaining a better understanding of the factors that can lead <b>bush</b> <b>pilots</b> to make poor decisions will allow initiatives to be developed that provide safety skills for all of the people involved in a flight...|$|R
