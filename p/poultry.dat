5|$|Livestock {{development}} and <b>poultry</b> production {{is a viable}} small scale enterprise for farmers in the province. The provincial government maintains breeding facilities in strategic locations province-wide to encourage farmers to engage in livestock and <b>poultry</b> production to augment their income. Livestock and <b>poultry</b> management training and seminars is provided to interested clients.|$|E
5|$|<b>Poultry</b> is {{the second}} most widely eaten type of meat {{globally}} and, along with eggs, provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat. All <b>poultry</b> meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked {{in order to reduce the}} risk of food poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The Buckeye was {{admitted}} to the American <b>Poultry</b> Association's Standard of Perfection in 1904. Entrance into the Standard of Perfection signifies official certification as a breed by the Association, and thus allows Buckeyes to be entered into <b>poultry</b> shows and judged according to the breed standard (as outlined in the Standard of Perfection).|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated and bred as <b>poultry</b> {{for use as}} food {{for at least four}} {{thousand}} years. The most important species is the chicken. It appears to have been domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and only later used for food. In ancient Egypt, <b>poultry</b> including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and then bred in captivity.|$|E

5|$|Chiniot Bazaar {{is known}} for allopathic and homoeopathic {{medicinal}} stores, cloth, blankets, sofa cloth, and curtains. It also has <b>poultry</b> feed wholesale shops.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour {{departed}} Plymouth on 26 August 1768, carrying 94people and 18 {{months of}} provisions. Livestock on board included pigs, <b>poultry,</b> two greyhounds and a milking goat.|$|E
5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live <b>poultry</b> are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic <b>poultry</b> can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E
5|$|In the American Standard of Perfection, the {{standard}} male weight for the bantam Silkie is 1kg (36oz) {{and for the}} female, 907 g (32oz). The Australian <b>Poultry</b> Standard and British <b>Poultry</b> Standard call for Silkie bantams much smaller; in the Australian, {{the standard}} weights are 680 g (25oz) for males and 570 g (20oz) for females. The British standard weight for bantam Silkies is 600 g (22oz) for males, and 500 g for females (18oz).|$|E

5|$|The first <b>poultry</b> breed to {{have its}} own {{specialist}} club for enthusiasts, Sebrights were admitted to <b>poultry</b> exhibition standards not long after their establishment. Today, they are among the most popular of bantam breeds. Despite their popularity, Sebrights are often difficult to breed, and the inheritance of certain unique characteristics the breed carries has been studied scientifically. As a largely ornamental chicken, they lay tiny, white eggs and are not kept for meat production.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Dudley, Arkansas {{is the site of}} the latest investigation for Mulder and Scully, who are sent to find a missing <b>poultry</b> inspector. The case takes a twist when another <b>poultry</b> worker is shot after she goes insane, leading Mulder to believe that certain townspeople are cannibals.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, more {{chickens}} {{are kept}} {{than any other}} type of <b>poultry,</b> with over 50 billion birds being raised each year as a source of meat and eggs. Traditionally, such birds would have been kept extensively in small flocks, foraging during the day and housed at night. This is still the case in developing countries, where the women often make important contributions to family livelihoods through keeping <b>poultry.</b> However, rising world populations and urbanization have led to the bulk of production being in larger, more intensive specialist units. These are often situated close to where the feed is grown or near to where the meat is needed, and result in cheap, safe food being made available for urban communities. Profitability of production depends very much on the price of feed, which has been rising. High feed costs could limit further development of <b>poultry</b> production.|$|E
5|$|Aylesbury ducks were {{imported}} into the United States in 1840, although they never became a popular breed. They were, however, {{added to the}} American <b>Poultry</b> Association's Standard of Perfection breeding guidelines in 1876. As of 2013, the breed was listed as critically endangered in the United States by The Livestock Conservancy.|$|E
5|$|Chesbro married Mabel Suttleworth of Conway, Massachusetts, in 1896. After his retirement, Chesbro farmed {{and raised}} <b>poultry</b> in Conway, {{where he died}} on November 6, 1931 of a {{myocardial}} infarction; he was buried at Howland Cemetery in Conway. Mabel died in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Crushed shells {{are added}} as a {{calcareous}} {{supplement to the}} diet of laying <b>poultry.</b> Oyster shell and cockle shell are often {{used for this purpose}} and are obtained as a by-product from other industries.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{geographical}} {{condition of the}} province, crops and livestock production is generally deficient {{as compared to the}} food requirements of Romblon population. To meet the rice requirements, Romblon relies on imports from the neighboring provinces while vegetables, <b>poultry</b> meat, vegetables and fruits are supplied mostly by Luzon.|$|E
5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other <b>poultry,</b> dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} <b>poultry.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2006, PETA {{went before}} Burger King's board of {{directors}} during its parent company's annual corporate meeting to request that <b>poultry</b> suppliers switched to a more-humane method of slaughter called controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). Instead of using its previous tactic of stating that the procedure is more humane, {{the group claimed that}} CAK was economically more feasible as it reduces the chances of injury to workers in <b>poultry</b> factories and it produces better products by preventing injury to the animal. Responding to the proposal in March 2007, Burger King announced it would make further changes to its animal-welfare policies. The new policies favor suppliers of chickens that utilize CAK rather than electric shock to knock birds unconscious before slaughter, and require its pork and <b>poultry</b> suppliers to upgrade the living conditions of pigs and chickens. Under the agreement, 2% of BK's North American egg suppliers are to use cage-free-produced eggs and 10% of pork suppliers are to use crate-free pigs for its pork products. PETA and the Humane Society of the United States were quoted as saying that Burger King’s initiatives put it ahead of its competitors in terms of animal rights and welfare and that they were hopeful that the new initiatives would trigger reform throughout the fast food industry as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Great Southern {{had over}} 430 {{employees}} managing investment schemes {{on behalf of}} over 47000 investors. Industry sectors in which investment occurred included beef cattle, forestry, wine grapes, almonds, and <b>poultry</b> production. Its plantation estate had grown to 179000 hectares, {{the vast majority of}} which was for wood pulp production.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developed}} world Campylobacter jejuni is {{the primary cause of}} bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to <b>poultry.</b> In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species. If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for a period of several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food. Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, <b>poultry,</b> seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices. In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis. This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food.|$|E
5|$|Iron is pervasive, but {{particularly}} rich sources of dietary iron include red meat, lentils, beans, <b>poultry,</b> fish, leaf vegetables, watercress, tofu, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and blackstrap molasses. Bread and breakfast cereals are sometimes specifically fortified with iron. Iron in low amounts {{is found in}} molasses, teff, and farina.|$|E
5|$|It {{can become}} quite bold and tame, much like its close relative, the pied currawong on the Australian mainland, {{especially}} in public parks and gardens where people make {{a habit of}} feeding it. Black currawongs have been recorded taking young peas from pods, raiding orchards, seizing chickens from <b>poultry</b> yards, and entering barns in search of mice.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{is known}} for its {{high-quality}} cocoa and vanilla, much of which are exported. In the coastal areas of Madagascar or in upscale inland restaurants, vanilla may be used to prepare savory sauces for <b>poultry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mishmar HaEmek {{is one of}} {{the richest}} of the kibbutzim in Israel. It is based on a socialist {{structure}} where all assets are communally owned and all residents earn the same amount of money. The economy is also based on intensive farming, including field crops, orchards, dairy cattle and <b>poultry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{implicated in}} the {{predation}} of game and song birds, hares, rabbits, muskrats, and young ungulates, particularly in preserves, reserves, and hunting farms where ground nesting birds are protected and raised, {{as well as in}} <b>poultry</b> farms.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{agricultural}} {{damage was}} reported, especially in Quảng Bình Province. More than 3,000square kilometres (1,200sq mi) of crops, mostly rice, were damaged or washed {{away by the}} floodwaters. There were also reports of heavy losses of <b>poultry</b> and livestock, and nearly 13km² (5sq mi) of aquaculture and 786 fishing boats were lost.|$|E
5|$|The Distribution Network Operator for {{electricity}} is EDF Energy. The largest straw-burning power {{station in the}} world is at nearby Sutton. This renewable energy resource power station rated at 36.85MW from burning biomass, nearly 25percent of the total renewable energy reported for Cambridgeshire in 2009. The world's largest <b>poultry</b> litter power plant, 38.5MW, is at Thetford, Norfolk.|$|E
5|$|The Livestock Conservancy {{maintains}} a conservation priority list that divides endangered breeds of horses, asses, sheep, goats, cattle, rabbits, pigs and <b>poultry</b> into five categories based on population numbers and historical interest. The organization has published several books, {{and works with}} breed registries and other groups on several aspects of breed preservation, including genetic testing, historical documentation, animal rescue and marketing. Preservation of genetic material is of special interest to the Conservancy, and {{for a period of}} time it maintained a gene bank that was later transferred to the United States Department of Agriculture. It has also developed and published several heritage definitions, including parameters for heritage breeds of cattle and <b>poultry.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Silkie (sometimes spelled Silky) is a {{breed of}} chicken {{named for its}} atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk, and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most {{chickens}} only have four. They are often exhibited in <b>poultry</b> shows, and appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It {{is among the most}} docile of <b>poultry.</b> Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Though they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature. Silkie chickens are very easy to keep as pets. They are suitable for children, as they can easily withstand being roughly handled.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasive}} algae {{are regularly}} monitored and removed {{to protect the}} benthic habitat. Indigenous sorts of cultivated plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous. Those include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a <b>poultry</b> breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{state had}} 85,500 farms in 2012, collectively {{producing}} $4.3 billion in animal products {{and fewer than}} one billion dollars in crop output with more than $6.1 billion added to the state's gross domestic product. <b>Poultry</b> and swine are its second and third-largest agricultural industries.|$|E
5|$|The toxic {{properties}} of parsnip extracts {{are resistant to}} heating, or a storage period of several months. Toxic symptoms can also affect livestock and <b>poultry</b> in parts of their bodies where their skin is exposed. Polyynes {{can be found in}} Apiaceae vegetables such as parsnip, and they show cytotoxic activities.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no single}} universally agreed {{definition}} of which species are livestock. Widely agreed types of livestock include cattle for beef and dairy, sheep, goats, pigs, and <b>poultry.</b> Various other species are sometimes considered livestock, such as horses, while <b>poultry</b> birds are sometimes excluded. In {{some parts of the}} world, livestock includes species such as buffalo, and the South American camelids, the alpaca and llama. Some authorities use much broader definitions to include fish in aquaculture, micro-livestock such as rabbits and guinea pigs, as well as insects from honey bees to crickets raised for human consumption.|$|E
