Properties, Uses, Applications: Hydrogen Gas and Liquid Hydrogen|publisher=Universal Industrial Gases, Inc.|accessdate=5 February 2008}} In the orthohydrogen form, the spins {{of the two}} protons are parallel and form a triplet state with a molecular spin quantum number of 1 (+); in the <b>parahydrogen</b> form the spins are antiparallel and form a singlet with a molecular spin quantum number of 0 (–). At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen gas contains about 25% of the para form and 75% of the ortho form, {{also known as the}} [...] "normal form". The equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to <b>parahydrogen</b> depends on temperature, but because the ortho form is an excited state and has a higher energy than the para form, it is unstable and cannot be purified. At very low temperatures, the equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of the para form. The liquid and gas phase thermal properties of pure <b>parahydrogen</b> differ significantly from those of the normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities, as discussed more fully in spin isomers of hydrogen. The ortho/para distinction also occurs in other hydrogen-containing molecules or functional groups, such as water and methylene, but is of little significance for their thermal properties.|$|E
50|$|When {{an excess}} of <b>parahydrogen</b> is used during {{hydrogenation}} reactions (instead of the normal mixture of orthohydrogen to <b>parahydrogen</b> of 3:1), the resultant product exhibits hyperpolarized signals in proton NMR spectra, an effect termed PHIP (<b>Parahydrogen</b> Induced Polarisation) or, equivalently, PASADENA (<b>Parahydrogen</b> And Synthesis Allow Dramatically Enhanced Nuclear Alignment) (named for first recognition of the effect by Bowers and Weitekamp of Caltech), a phenomenon {{that has been used}} to study the mechanism of hydrogenation reactions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Parahydrogen</b> is {{in a lower}} {{energy state}} than is orthohydrogen. At room {{temperature}} and thermal equilibrium, thermal excitation causes hydrogen to consist of approximately 75% orthohydrogen and 25% <b>parahydrogen.</b> When hydrogen is liquified at low temperature, there is a slow spontaneous transition to a predominantly para ratio, with the released energy having implications for storage. Essentially pure <b>parahydrogen</b> form can be obtained at very low temperatures, {{but it is not}} possible to obtain a sample containing more than 75% orthohydrogen by cooling.|$|E

5000|$|The {{two forms}} of {{molecular}} hydrogen were first proposed by Werner Heisenberg and Friedrich Hund in 1927.

Modern isolation of pure <b>parahydrogen</b> has since been achieved using rapid in-vacuum deposition of millimeters thick solid <b>parahydrogen</b> (p-H2) samples which are notable for their excellent optical qualities.|$|E

50|$|However, {{orthohydrogen}} is thermodynamically unstable at {{low temperatures}} and spontaneously converts into <b>parahydrogen.</b> This process lacks any natural de-excitation radiation mode, {{so it is}} slow {{in the absence of}} a catalyst which can facilitate interconversion of the singlet and triplet spin states. At room temperature, hydrogen contains 75% orthohydrogen, a proportion which the liquefaction process preserves if carried out {{in the absence of a}} catalyst like ferric oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds,chromic oxide, or some nickel compounds to accelerate the conversion of the liquid hydrogen into <b>parahydrogen.</b> Alternatively, additional refrigeration equipment can be used to slowly absorb the heat that the orthohydrogen fraction will (more slowly) release as it spontaneously converts into <b>parahydrogen.</b> If orthohydrogen is not removed from rapidly liquified hydrogen, without a catalyst, the heat released during its decay can boil off as much as 50% of the original liquid.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} [...] that the scale is the kelvin scale shifted so that the boiling points of hydrogen and oxygen become zero and 70 respectively, but this {{is unlikely to be}} true. Oxygen under a standard atmosphere boils at a temperature in the 90.15 to 90.18 K range. For hydrogen, it depends on the molecular variety. The boiling point is 20.390 K for [...] "normal" [...] hydrogen (made up of 75% orthohydrogen and 25% <b>parahydrogen)</b> and 20.268 K for pure <b>parahydrogen.</b> Under the purported definition, absolute zero would lie at -20.15 °L.|$|E
5000|$|This is the T = 0 {{intercept}} {{seen in the}} molar {{energy of}} orthohydrogen. Since [...] "normal" [...] room-temperature hydrogen is a 3:1 ortho:para mixture, its molar residual rotational energy at low temperature is (3/4) x 2Rθrot = 1091 J/mol, which is somewhat larger than the enthalpy of vaporization of normal hydrogen, 904 J/mol at the boiling point, Tb = 20.369 K. Notably, the boiling points of <b>parahydrogen</b> and normal (3:1) hydrogen are nearly equal; for <b>parahydrogen</b> ∆Hvap = 898 J/mol at Tb = 20.277 K, and it follows that nearly all the residual rotational energy of orthohydrogen is retained in the liquid state.|$|E

50|$|Molecular {{hydrogen}} {{occurs in}} two isomeric forms, one with its two proton spins aligned parallel (orthohydrogen), {{the other with}} its two proton spins aligned antiparallel (<b>parahydrogen).</b> These two forms are {{often referred to as}} spin isomers, since they differ not in chemical structure (like most isomers) but rather in nuclear spin state.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, he was {{appointed}} director of the Max Planck Institute for Physical Chemistry in Göttingen. The institute was restructured long {{after his death in}} 1971 and is now the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen, also known as the Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer Institute.In 1929 Bonhoeffer, together with Paul Harteck, discovered the spin isomers of hydrogen, orthohydrogen and <b>parahydrogen.</b>|$|E
50|$|Room-temperature {{hydrogen}} consists {{mostly of}} the orthohydrogen form. After production, liquid hydrogen is in a metastable state {{and must be}} converted into the <b>parahydrogen</b> isomer form to avoid the exothermic reaction that occurs when it changes at low temperatures; this is usually performed using a catalyst like iron(III) oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds,chromium(III) oxide, or some nickel compounds.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} a nuclear {{magnetic}} transition degree of freedom which is of importance to heat capacity, is the transition which converts the spin isomers of hydrogen gas (H2) into each other. At room temperature, the proton spins of hydrogen gas are aligned 75% of the time, resulting in orthohydrogen when they are. Thus, some thermal energy has been stored {{in the degree of}} freedom available when <b>parahydrogen</b> (in which spins are anti-aligned) absorbs energy, and is converted to the higher energy ortho form. However, at the temperature of liquid hydrogen, not enough heat energy is available to produce orthohydrogen (that is, the transition energy between forms is large enough to [...] "freeze out" [...] at this low temperature), and thus the <b>parahydrogen</b> form predominates. The heat capacity of the transition is sufficient to release enough heat, as orthohydrogen converts to the lower-energy <b>parahydrogen,</b> to boil the hydrogen liquid to gas again, if this evolved heat is not removed with a catalyst after the gas has been cooled and condensed. This example also illustrates the fact that some modes of storage of heat may not be in constant equilibrium with each other in substances, and heat absorbed or released from such phase changes may [...] "catch up" [...] with temperature changes of substances, only after a certain time. In other words, the heat evolved and absorbed from the ortho-para isomeric transition contributes to the heat capacity of hydrogen on long time-scales, but not on short time-scales. These time scales may also depend on the presence of a catalyst.|$|E
50|$|From 1928 to 1933, Harteck was a staff {{scientist}} at the KWI für physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie (KWIPC) (Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Elektrochemistry) located in Dahlem-Berlin, where he worked with Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer on experiments on <b>parahydrogen</b> and orthohydrogen. While at the KWIPC, he completed his habilitation in 1931 at the Humboldt University of Berlin where he also supervised the dissertation of Karl-Hermann Geib who later developed the Girdler sulfide process.|$|E
50|$|Each {{hydrogen}} molecule (H2) {{consists of}} two hydrogen atoms linked by a covalent bond. If we neglect the small proportion of deuterium and tritium which may be present, each hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron. Each proton has an associated magnetic moment, which {{is associated with the}} proton's spin of 1/2. In the H2 molecule, the spins of the two hydrogen nuclei (protons) couple to form a triplet state known as orthohydrogen, and a singlet state known as <b>parahydrogen.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Slow equilibration: In some quasi-equilibrium {{situations}} it {{is possible}} to have two distinct populations of the same kind of particle in the same location, which are each equilibrated internally but not with each other. Though not strictly in equilibrium, it may be useful to name quasi-equilibrium chemical potentials which can differ among the different populations. Examples: (semiconductor physics) distinct quasi-Fermi levels (electron chemical potentials) in the conduction band and valence band; (spintronics) distinct spin-up and spin-down chemical potentials; (cryogenics) distinct <b>parahydrogen</b> and orthohydrogen chemical potentials.|$|E
50|$|Molecular hydrogen, H2, {{contains}} two different spin isomers, para-hydrogen and ortho-hydrogen, with {{a ratio of}} 25:75 at room temperature. Creating para-hydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) means that this ratio is increased, in other words that para-hydrogen is enriched. This {{can be accomplished by}} cooling hydrogen gas and then inducing ortho-to-para conversion via an iron-oxide or charcoal catalyst. When performing this procedure at ~70 K (i.e. with liquid nitrogen), para-hydrogen is enriched from 25% to ca. 50%. When cooling to below 20 K and then inducing the ortho-to-para conversion, close to 100% <b>parahydrogen</b> can be obtained.|$|E
50|$|NPDGamma is {{an ongoing}} effort to measure the parity-violating {{asymmetry}} in polarized cold neutron capture on parahydrogen.Polarized neutrons of energies 2 meV - 15 meV are incident on a liquid <b>parahydrogen</b> target. The neutrons are captured, forming Deuterium and releasing a gamma ray with an energy of 2.2 MeV (the binding energy of Deuterium), which is subsequently detected. The detector array consists of 4 rings of 12 detectors each, where each ring is concentric around the neutron beam. The polarization of the incoming neutron beam is alternated rapidly to study the spin correlation of {{the direction of the}} emitted gamma ray.|$|E

50|$|MRI has the {{advantages}} of having very high spatial resolution and is very adept at morphological imaging and functional imaging. MRI does have several disadvantages though. First, MRI has a sensitivity of around 10−3 mol/L to 10−5 mol/L which, compared to other types of imaging, can be very limiting. This problem {{stems from the fact}} that the difference between atoms in the high energy state and the low energy state is very small. For example, at 1.5 teslas, a typical field strength for clinical MRI, the difference between high and low energy states is approximately 9 molecules per 2 million. Improvements to increase MR sensitivity include increasing magnetic field strength, and hyperpolarization via optical pumping, dynamic nuclear polarization or <b>parahydrogen</b> induced polarization. There are also a variety of signal amplification schemes based on chemical exchange that increase sensitivity.|$|E

The pyridine ligands in 2 are labile, exchanging slowly into free pyridine with a rate constant of 0. 4 s− 1 for 2 a at 335 K in a dissociative process where ΔH = 134 ± 1 kJ mol− 1 and ΔS = 151 ± 5 J mol− 1 K− 1. Pyridine ligand exchange in 2 proves to be slower than that determined for 3. <b>Parahydrogen</b> induced polarization (PHIP) based on the hydride ligands of 2 and 3 is transferred efficiently to the 15 N nuclei of the bound pyridine ligand by suitable insensitive-nuclei-enhanced-by-polarization-transfer (INEPT) based procedures. Related methods are then used to facilitate the sensitization of the free pyridine 15 N signal by a factor of 120 -fold through ligand exchange even though this substrate does not contain <b>parahydrogen.</b> This therefore corresponds to the successful polarization of an analyte by <b>parahydrogen</b> induced polarization methods without the need for the actual chemical incorporation of any <b>parahydrogen</b> derived nuclei into it...|$|E
