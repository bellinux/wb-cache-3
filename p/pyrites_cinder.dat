40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed to}} obtain {{volatile}} copper from a high-copper <b>pyrite</b> <b>cinder</b> by optimizing the chloridizing roasting process using response surface methodology (RSM). The effect of key parameters, i. e., dosage of CaCl 2 addition, roasting time and roasting temperature, on the copper volatile ratio was investigated and a quadratic model was {{suggested by the}} methodology to correlate the variables to this volatile ratio. The {{results indicated that the}} model was in good agreement with the experimental data at a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 9782, and the most influential parameter on efficiency was identified as the dosage of CaCl 2 addition. The optimum conditions for chloridizing roasting from the high copper <b>pyrite</b> <b>cinder</b> were identified as a dosage of CaCl 2 addition of 4. 8 wt%, a roasting time of 19. 28 min and a roasting temperature of 1151. 51 °C; under such conditions, a copper volatile ratio of 97. 82 % was achieved.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the chemical compatibility of two (2) geosynthetics that have been selected as part of a subaqueous capping structure for in situ confinement of sediments contaminated with <b>pyrite</b> <b>cinders</b> and heavy metals. The geosynthetics under study were i) a high density polyethylene (HDPE) geogrid / polyester (PET) geotextile composite and ii) a woven / nonwoven PET geotextile composite. Specimens of both geosynthetics were immersed in contaminated sediment slurries taken from the site to be capped, at temperatures of 21 and 50 oC. After 1, 2, 3 and 4 months immersion, specimens were extracted and submitted to physical and mechanical tests so as to monitor the evolution of their residual properties. Analyses of the chemical compatibility test results have demonstrated that the HDPE geogrid / PET geotextile composite does not present any apparent chemical incompatibility with the <b>pyrite</b> <b>cinders.</b> The same conclusion applies to the PET geotextile composite, even if it underwent noticeable strength reduction immediately after being immersed in the contaminated sediment slurry. This could be explained by the physical interaction between the sediment particles and the PET fibres.

40|$|Abstract: As the Fenton-like {{oxidation}} reaction {{based on}} iron-bearing minerals could solve some {{problems of the}} traditional Fenton oxidation reaction, it became a talking point in academic circles worldwide recently. For the Fenton-like reaction, catalyst selection is an important research parameter. The new Fenton-like reaction uses iron-bearing cinder as catalyst by employing Reactive Black 5 (RB 5), the object of investigation, as the target pollutant. By examining the dosage of catalyst, hydrogen peroxide, initial pH, reaction time, concentration of pollutants, optimized reaction conditions can be obtained. Results show that <b>pyrite</b> <b>cinder</b> gives rise to high catalytic activity in the Fenton-like reaction. When 5 ml/L of hydrogen peroxide and 10 g/L of cinder were added to 75 mg/L of dye, the removal rate of RB 5 {{was found to be}} 96 % in 4 hours. Compared to the traditional Fenton reaction, it has a wider pH range and higher catalytic oxidation activity, especially under alkaline condition...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with exploring the possibilities of using solidification/stabilization (S/S) treatment for toxic sludge generated in dye effluent treatment, when <b>pyrite</b> <b>cinder</b> is used as catalytic iron source in the modified heterogeneous Fenton process. S/S treatment was performed by using different clay materials (kaolin, bentonite and native clay from the territory of Vojvodina) and fly ash in order to immobilize toxic metals and arsenic presented in sludge. For {{the evaluation of the}} extraction potential of toxic metals and the effectiveness of the S/S treatment applied, four single-step leaching tests were performed. Leaching test results indicated that all applied S/S treatments were effective in immobilizing toxic metals and arsenic presented in sludge.

40|$|In {{a series}} of pot trials, fodder radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiformis Pers.) was {{cultivated}} in <b>pyrite</b> <b>cinders</b> heavily Polluted by various heavy metals (HM). The effects of application of humic acids (HA) to the cultures were evaluated at various concentrations (0. 1 and 1 g kg(- 1) of cinders) and for different methods of application (mixed with cinders before sowing; applied {{on the top of}} substrate after sowing; foliar spraying), in comparison with untreated controls. HA increased the bioavailability of various HM, especially when applied at high concentrations. Low concentrations of HA, either mixed with cinders or applied on foliage, slightly enhanced shoot growth. High levels of HA were generally phytotoxic, probably because of the ensuing higher heavy metal concentrations in the shoots. Foliar spraying was partially able to attenuate the phytotoxicity of high dosages of HA, as revealed by the increased rate of leaf expansion. A negative correlation was found between shoot biomass and concentration of HM, and higher removals were generally associated with smaller doses of HA and foliar application. Within the range of concentrations tested, humic substances led to a reduction in root diameter and an increase in specific root length (SRL, length per unit weight of roots), significant only at the highest dosage, together with a tendency towards enhancement of translocation of HM to the shoot - both positive traits for phytoremediation purposes...|$|R

The crops received respectively mineral fertilization and organic amendment while plants in control soil did not receive any input.

40|$|A {{plume of}} <b>pyrite</b> <b>cinder</b> {{leachate}} originates in an aquifer {{in the vicinity}} of a canal. Besides being slightly acidic, the plume carries dissolved concentrations of As, Zn and Ni. The canal has a variable stage, either leading the aquifer to drain into the canal or canal water infiltration into the aquifer. In order to assess to what extent sorption to iron hydroxides combined with seasonal reductive dissolution could be responsible for contaminant patterns observed in the field, a 2 D reactive transport model using MODFLOW and PHT 3 D was setup. The model is a cross-section to the canal, and a time-dependent river boundary is used to simulate the varying stage of the canal. The model incorporates diffuse double layer sorption on iron hydroxides and cation exchange. It maximizes the potential reductive dissolution of iron hydroxides that could ensue from the oscillatory infiltration drainage patterns. Comparison of field data and model results shows that the processes incorporated in the model account for only part of the results, but are insufficient to reproduce all aspects of field patterns. Possible causes for the incomplete reproduction of field data are identified. Through {{the way in which they}} affect the flow field, conductivity and temporal discretization of the canal stage boundary condition are seen to affect redox and acidity sensitive reactions. Effects of the flow field on dilution are also apparent. Ultimately, the conductivity and temporal discretization cause changes of several orders of magnitude in contaminant concentrations arriving at the canal.

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on two {{industrial}} by-products, Blast Furnace Slags (BFS) and <b>Pyrite</b> <b>cinders</b> (PC). The BFS which comes from the north of Sweden has been suspected {{to be the source}} of occasional occurences of acidity observed in leachates emerging from the material when disposed in road basement. Acid leachates polluted with high concentrations of As and Cu were collected {{at the base of a}} provisory landfill containing PC in the vicinity of the old factories. In the BFS, chemical analyses indicated that reduced S are present and, if oxidised, could be a potential source of acidity. However, the sequential chemical extraction showed large amounts of Ca and Mg in BFS which are assumingly linked to instable alcalic oxides and silicates. They can be dissolved in water and neutralise any acidity produced. Hence, the material in itself cannot be judged to be acid-producing. Acid assessment (Acid Base Account) is not applicable to BFS unless it is adapted to silicate buffering materials.. In the PC, pyrite was observed by XRD and other sulfides linked with Zn and Cu were indicated using sequential chemical extraction. Jarosite was observed by XRD and confirmed by the extraction. In PC, As seems to be associated with the reducible fraction (oxides) and Cu with the oxidizable fraction (sulfides). Acid assessment indicated a high acid producing capacity for PC but the method has to be adapted to sulphates which were shown to constitute an important fraction of the S present in the material. The sequential extraction procedure has to be adapted to a high amount of crystallized hematite present in PC. A longer extraction time in oxalic acid is recommended. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} {{deals with the}} phytoremediation of a metal-polluted, markedly degraded area located at Torviscosa (Udine, North-East Italy) and included within the perimeter identified as a site of national interest for restoration. The cleaning up of this disused dump for <b>pyrite</b> <b>cinders</b> derived from ore roasting for sulphur extraction requires effective approaches {{as the use of}} the EDTA structural isomer (S,S) -N,N’-ethylenediamine disuccinic acid (EDDS) in a chelant-enhanced phytoextraction programme. The easily biodegradable EDDS exerts its effects by solubilising target metals from soil and making them more available for plant uptake and translocation to shoots and by preventing movement of metal complexes into groundwater. The phytoextraction effectiveness was investigated using the two accumulator crops Raphanus sativus and Brassica carinata. These crops were grown in opaque PVC pots filled with the multiple polluted soil mixed with sand (1 : 1, w/w) and amended with single(2, 5 or 5 mmol kg- 1) or repeated doses (1 mmol kg- 1) of EDDS distributed in different growth stages. The lower single application and B. carinata were more effective in phytoextraction compared to the other treatments and crop because no metal leaching and dry biomass reduction occurred together with a higher metal translocation (+ 31 %). Among the metals present in the cinders, Cu – which exceeded 14 -fold the national legal limits – showed the highest rate of complexation (log K 18. 4). Therefore, to improve the knowledge of the main key mechanisms of chelant-stimulated metal acquisition, uptake and translocation of CuEDDS complexes by B. carinata were studied both in excised and intact roots. CuEDDS treatment determined a lower Cu uptake compared to the metal alone because the complex had to be split before Cu uptake. At the same time, the CuEDDS treatment resulted in a higher metal translocation. To {{gain a better understanding of}} Cu uptake, elemental maps of Cu were generated by micro-PIXE technique. In B. carinata roots Cu was found to be localized mainly in the xylem system and transported to specific tissues for subsequent use and sequestration. Finally, B. carinata reacted positively to CuEDDS exposure, developing adaptive mechanisms by adjusting gene expression and showing tolerance to oxidative stress induced by Cu...|$|R
