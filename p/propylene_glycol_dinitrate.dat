50|$|Named {{after its}} inventor, Otto Reitlinger, Otto Fuel II {{consists}} of the nitrated ester explosive propellant <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (PGDN), to which a desensitizer (dibutyl sebacate) and a stabilizer (2-nitrodiphenylamine) have been added. The chief component, <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> accounts for approximately 76% of the mixture, while dibutyl sebacate and 2-nitrodiphenylamine account for approximately 22.5% and 1.5% (by weight), respectively.|$|E
50|$|Otto Fuel II, {{a mixture}} of the low {{explosive}} <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> with a stabilizer, has also been tried in 37mm guns.|$|E

50|$|The primary base {{ingredients}} {{of the liquid}} solution is <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and glycerin. About 20% to 27% of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and glycerin-based liquid particles are inhaled. The long-term effects of inhaled <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> has not been studied, and is unknown. The effects of inhaled glycerin are unknown. Being exposed to <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> may cause irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract. The risk from the inhalation of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and glycerin is probably low. <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and glycerin have not {{been shown to be}} safe. Some research states that <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> emissions may cause respiratory irritation and raise the likelihood to develop asthma. Long-term inhalation of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> indoors could increase risk to children to develop asthma. To lessen the risks, most e-cigarettes companies began to use water and glycerin as replacement for <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> The inhaled glycerin could cause lipoid pneumonia.|$|R
25|$|<b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> oxidizes {{when exposed}} to air and heat, forming lactic acid. If not {{properly}} inhibited, this fluid can be very corrosive, so pH buffering agents such as dipotassium phosphate and potassium bicarbonate are often added to <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> to prevent acidic corrosion of metal components. Pre-inhibited <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> solutions {{can also be used}} instead of pure <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> to prevent corrosion.|$|R
50|$|Nitrates of polyhydric alcohols, {{of which}} <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> is an example, {{have been used}} in {{medicine}} for the treatment of angina pectoris, and as explosives since the mid-nineteenth century.|$|E

5000|$|Plasticizers. Improve the {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} propellant particles. For composite rocket propellants, dioctyl adipate, isodecyl pelargonate, and dioctyl phthalate are often used. Plasticizers can also be other energetic materials (common in smokeless powders), e.g. nitroglycerine, butanetriol trinitrate, dinitrotoluene, trimethylolethane trinitrate, diethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> triethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> bis(2,2-dinitropropyl)formal, bis(2,2-dinitropropyl)acetal, 2,2,2-trinitroethyl 2-nitroxyethyl ether, and others.|$|R
30|$|The results {{presented}} here indicate that detection of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> {{is common in}} hospital patients, particularly those managed from drug overdoses or other toxic ingestions. The major source of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> comes from iatrogenic administration of poorly water-soluble medications, especially intravenous lorazepam used for sedation. Intravenous formulations of lorazepam may contain up to 80 % (v/v) <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> Other intravenous medications that may contain <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> include diazepam, etomidate, and phenytoin (Al-Khafaji et al. 2002; Arbour 1999; Chicella et al. 2002; Parker et al. 2002). Another source of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is activated charcoal preparations that use <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> as the excipient to make the charcoal less gritty and easier to administer (Krasowski et al. 2012). Although the toxic plasma concentration of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> is not well-defined, toxicity has been reported with plasma concentrations as low as 100  mg/dL (Zar et al. 2007). However, even if not directly toxic, <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> increases plasma osmolality and complicates the use of osmolal gap in clinical diagnosis and management, especially for patients receiving multiple doses of propylene glycol-containing medication, as may be done in intubated patients requiring extended sedation (Krasowski et al. 2012). <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> has also been reported as an interferent in enzyme assays for ethylene glycol (Malandain & Cano 1996; Juenke et al. 2011). Our study demonstrates that <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> may be detected in patients who have ingested ethylene glycol, with iatrogenic drugs such as intravenous lorazepam or activated charcoal being common sources of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> These findings illustrate the importance of specific assays for determination of ethylene glycol in human samples.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (PGDN, 1,2-{{propylene}} glycol dinitrate, or 1,2-propanediol dinitrate) is {{an organic}} chemical, an ester of nitric acid and propylene glycol. It is structurally similar to nitroglycerin, {{except that it}} has one fewer -O-NO2 group. It is a characteristically and unpleasantly smelling colorless liquid, which decomposes at 121 °C, below its boiling point. It is flammable and explosive. It is shock-sensitive and burns with a clean flame producing water, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen.|$|E
5000|$|Monopropellants {{are also}} used in some air-independent {{propulsion}} systems (AIP) to [...] "fuel" [...] reciprocating or turbine engines in environments where free oxygen is unavailable. Weapons intended primarily for combat between nuclear-powered submarines generally fall into this category. The most commonly used propellant {{in this case is}} stabilized <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (PGDN), often referred to as [...] "Otto fuel". A potential future use for monopropellants not directly related to propulsion is in compact, high-intensity powerplants for aquatic or exoatmospheric environments.|$|E
50|$|This distinct-smelling, reddish-orange, oily {{liquid is}} a mixture of three {{synthetic}} substances: <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (the major component), 2-nitrodiphenylamine, and dibutyl sebacate. It does not need exposure to any oxidant to ignite and release energy, as its three components will react among themselves whenever vaporised and heated. Needing no oxidants and being a stable substance makes Otto Fuel II ideal for use in the constrained environment of a submarine. Although the fuel can be made to explode, this requires extreme conditions (such that it can be regarded as practically stable). The vapour pressure of the fuel is low (i.e., it is not volatile), minimising toxic hazards. Finally, the fuel's energy density far surpasses the capacity of the electric battery used in other torpedoes, maximising range.|$|E

40|$|Keratosis, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} skin manifestations of arsenicosis, can be treated by either oral or topical formulation of drug. In this study we examined the effectiveness and tolerance of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> for the treatment of arsenical palmer keratosis. Sixty patients of arsenicosis with palmer keratoses were randomly divided into three groups and different concentrations (15, 30 and 45 %) of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> were applied topically into their palms once at bedtime for eight weeks. The perception of the patient about the progress of treatment was scored with “Likert scale”. The mean (±SD) score of patient’s perception following completion of treatment were 1. 27 ± 1. 26 (using 15 % <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol),</b> 2. 88 ± 1. 26 (30 % <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol),</b> and 3. 75 ± 1. 06 (45 % <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol)</b> respectively. The scores increased with higher concentra-tions. Thirty percent or more concentration of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> was effective for mild to severe form of keratosis. <b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> was well tolerable. In conclusion, both roughness and thickness of arsenical palmer keratosis can be reduced using <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> and as the concentration of the drug increases it increases its effectiveness without any significant adverse effect...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation {{was made of}} the combustion characteristics of nitrate ester droplets, including <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate,</b> ethyl nitrate and n-propyl nitrate: at various ambient gas te peratures and pre-ssures. MPeasurements were made of droplet diameter and temperature during codbustion. At high pressures, the droplet ignited early in its heat-up period at a more or less fixed liquid temperature. At low pressures, the droplet ignited as its temperatre approached the wet bulb temperature. A simpvlified theoretical model was found to give an adequate correlation of the ignition time in both regimes. A combustion model was formulated in studying the burning rates of the droplets. The model includes the effect of conviction on the burning rate. This model was found to be in fair agreement with the data. -...|$|E
40|$|Examination of the {{influence}} of dissolved gases {{on the state of the}} liquid surface during high-pressure liquid-monopropellant combustion through the use of a strand burning experiment. Liquid surface temperatures were measured, using fine-wire thermocouples, during the strand combustion of ethyl nitrate, normal propyl nitrate, and <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> at pressures up to 81 atm. These measurements were compared with the predictions of a variable-property gas-phase analysis assuming an infinite activation energy for the decomposition reaction. The state of the liquid surface was estimated using a conventional low-pressure phase equilibrium model, as well as a high-pressure version that considered the presence of dissolved combustion-product gases in the liquid phase. The high-pressure model was found to give a superior prediction of measured liquid surface temperatures. Computed total pressures required for the surface to reach its critical mixing point during strand combustion were found to be in the range from 2. 15 to 4. 62 times the critical pressure of the pure propellant. Computed dissolved gas concentrations at the liquid surface were in the range from 35 to 50 % near the critical combustion condition...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} an effective microchip protocol based on electrophoretic-separation and electrochemical detection for highly sensitive and rapid measurements of nitrate ester explosives, including {{ethylene glycol dinitrate}} (EGDN), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (PGDN) and glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin, NG). Factors influencing the separation and detection processes were examined and optimized. Under the optimal separation conditions obtained using a 15 mM borate buffer (pH 9. 2) containing 20 mM SDS, and applying a separation voltage of 1500 V, the four nitrate ester explosives were separated within less than 3 min. The glassy-carbon amperometric detector (operated at - 0. 9 V vs. Ag/AgCl) offers convenient cathodic detection down to the picogram level, with detection limits of 0. 5 ppm and 0. 3 ppm for PGDN and for NG, respectively, along with good repeatability (RSD of 1. 8 - 2. 3 %; n = 6) and linearity (over the 10 - 60 ppm range). Such effective microchip operation offers great promise for field screening of nitrate ester explosives and for supporting various counter-terrorism surveillance activities.

40|$|<b>Propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>dinitrate</b> (PGDN) is an {{important}} component used in the formulation of energetic materials. A renewable, environmentally-friendly and effective production technique for the production of 1, 2 -propanediol, {{an important}} precursor to PGDN, is desired. While fermentation of 1, 2 -propanediol has been achieved, it suffers from major limitations such as expensive feed sugars and relatively low yields. It is hypothesized that algae sugars could serve as a feedstock for the microbial synthesis of 1, 2 -propanediol, thereby reducing production costs and enhancing sustainability. Algal biomass produced from an Algal Turf Scrubber® has proven to have significant potential as a source of fermentable materials. However, to commercialize the production of 1, 2 -propanediol and other bulk chemicals from algae, growth rates need to be optimized. It has been suggested that the addition of carbon dioxide gas can enhance the growth rates of algae. This dissertation demonstrates a novel method of gas delivery to thin-film aqueous systems utilizing a unique hollow fiber membrane manifold that is ideal for use in ATS® systems. It was determined that hollow fiber membranes are more effective at delivering gas to liquid compared to traditional bubbling and a porous diffuser, particularly at shallow depths. A mass transfer model was developed to describe the transport of carbon dioxide gas into water in such systems. In addition to the need for increased growth rates, further challenges lie in the recovery of fermentable materials from algal biomass. While methods of extraction have been developed for other algae components, such as algal oils and proteins, most of the techniques are not suitable for the recovery of fermentable carbohydrates. Very few techniques have focused on the extraction of carbohydrates, and those that do lack economic efficiency due to long processing times and high costs associated with enzymes and/or energy requirements. By combining mechanical means of disruption, such as abrasive material, with sonication, it could be possible to reduce processing times, thereby lowering energy costs. Based on this hypothesis, a novel technique for the extraction of algal sugars was developed. This technique, deemed “sonic abrasion,” was found to extract nearly twice as much sugar than sonication alone, and adequate carbohydrate concentrations for use in fermentation processes could be achieved. Finally, the feasibility of utilizing algal derived sugars to ferment 1, 2 -propanediol from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum was investigated using a 10 g/l synthetic algal sugar mixture. When compared to a 10 g/l glucose feed, {{it was found that the}} synthetic algal sugar mixture was capable of producing nearly twice as much 1, 2 -propanediol whilst producing fewer by-products...|$|E

For this purpose a laboratory experiment on the conserving and/or denaturing effect of <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> on mitochondrial DNA (COI) was set up. For the experiment 110 specimens of the common and abundant wolf spider species Pardosa lugubris were manually captured, killed and incubated from one to four weeks in either pure or watered <b>propylene</b> <b>glycol</b> or 70 % denatured ethanol.
