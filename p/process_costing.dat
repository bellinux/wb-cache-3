25|$|Garner credits Nicholson {{with the}} {{original}} development of the several methods of accounting for scrap (although some earlier pioneering work had been done in this area), and he feels that the works of subsequent writers are primarily elaborations of Nicholson's treatment. In the differentiation of the uses of, and the accounting for job order costing and <b>process</b> <b>costing,</b> Nicholson was especially farsighted, missing only the now-taken-for granted concept of equivalent production in the valuation of inventories and the calculation {{of the cost of}} goods sold. He was apparently the first individual to develop the concepts and comparative advantages of accounting for costs departmentally, on a cumulative or non-cumulative basis that is, pyramided and non-pyramided departmental costs.|$|E
2500|$|All {{infantry}} {{units are}} [...] "built" [...] {{either at the}} barracks or archery range. Before building a unit, the player must choose which items are to be equipped to that unit. Each unit has three slots for customization, with the player free to choose from a primary weapon, a secondary weapon and, depending on the primary and secondary weapon, a shield. However, most weapons and shields must be researched before the player can equip them. Once researched, the weapon then has to be manufactured, with research and manufacture carried out in two separate buildings, with each <b>process</b> <b>costing</b> resources and taking time. Once a weapon has been researched and manufactured, the player is free to equip it to a unit. Weapon manufacture is a one-time procedure, and is not required every time the player equips that particular weapon. An alternative way to equip soldiers is to have workers collect the equipment of defeated enemies. These weapons can then {{be used by the}} player to equip their own army at no cost, and with no research or manufacture time.|$|E

50|$|<b>Process</b> <b>costing</b> is an {{accounting}} methodology that traces and accumulates direct costs, and allocates indirect {{costs of a}} manufacturing process. Costs are assigned to products, usually in a large batch, which might include an entire month's production. Eventually, costs have to be allocated to individual units of product. It assigns average costs to each unit, and is the opposite extreme of Job costing which attempts to measure individual costs of production of each unit. <b>Process</b> <b>costing</b> is usually a significant chapter. It is a method of assigning costs to units of production in companies producing large quantities of homogeneous products.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA five-step {{framework}} {{to support the}} development of strategic manufacturing capabilities through dynamic <b>process</b> <b>cost</b> modelling is presented. The framework aims to develop insight into what manufacturing capabilities are required to reach the strategic goals. The framework combines system dynamics simulation with <b>process</b> <b>cost</b> modelling and visual exploratory data analysis in an iterative process of hypothesis formulation and model development. The presented framework links the strategy process to the choice of production and operations improvement initiatives on the plant level. System dynamics encourages a high level perspective that permits manufacturing capabilities to be interpreted in terms of generic production features instead of choice of technology or practice. The value of dynamic <b>process</b> <b>cost</b> modelling as a support to the strategy formulation process is shown. The applicability of the five-step framework is demonstrated through a case study from the steel industry...|$|R

50|$|Costing is an {{important}} process that many companies engage in {{to keep track of}} where their money is being spent in the production and distribution processes. Understanding these costs {{is the first step in}} being able to control them. It is very important that a company chooses the appropriate type of costing system for their product type and industry. One type of costing system that is used in certain industries is <b>process</b> <b>costing</b> that varies from other types of costing (such as job costing) in some ways. In <b>process</b> <b>costing</b> unit costs are more like averages, the process-costing system requires less bookkeeping than does a job-order costing system. Thus, some companies often prefer to use the process-costing system.|$|E
