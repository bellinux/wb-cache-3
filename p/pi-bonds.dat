The effective masses, band gaps, and transmission coefficients of semi-conducting, zigzag, (n, 0) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) resulting from the ab initio tight-binding density functional theory (DFT) code FIREBALL and the empirical, nearest-neighbor <b>pi-bond</b> model are compared for all semiconducting n values 5 <(=) n <(=) 35.

50|$|Pi bonds {{result from}} overlap of atomic orbitals {{that are in}} contact through two areas of overlap. <b>Pi-bonds</b> are more diffuse bonds than the sigma bonds.

5000|$|Diphosphorus is an {{inorganic}} chemical with the chemical formula [...] Unlike its nitrogen group neighbor nitrogen, which forms a stable N2 molecule with a nitrogen to nitrogen triple bond, phosphorus prefers a tetrahedral form P4 because P-P <b>pi-bonds</b> {{are high in}} energy.

50|$|The Smith indole {{synthesis}} {{begins by}} use of two equivalents of an organolithium reagent (as organolithium reagents are very strong bases) to extract a hydrogen from both the alkyl substituent and the nitrogen, resulting in a negative charge on both. The synthesis proceeds with a nucleophilic attack of the carbanion on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ester or carboxylic acid. When this occurs, the <b>pi-bond</b> of the electrophile is converted into a lone pair on the oxygen. These lone pairs are then reconverted back into a <b>pi-bond,</b> resulting in the expulsion of the -OR group. Next, the negatively charged nitrogen performs a nucleophilic attack on the adjacent electrophilic carbonyl carbon, again causing the <b>pi-bond</b> of the electrophile to be converted into a lone pair on the oxygen. This negatively charged oxygen then performs a nucleophilic attack on the silicon atom of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) group, resulting in a tricyclic compound, and a positively charged silicon atom and neutral oxygen atom. The synthesis proceeds through an intramolecular heteroatom Peterson olefination, ultimately resulting in an elimination reaction which expels a TMSO group and forms a <b>pi-bond</b> in the five-membered ring at the nitrogen atom. Then, keto-enol tautomerism occurs, resulting in the desired product.|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{generating}} angular forces around sigma-bonded {{transition metal ions}} is generalized to treat <b>pi-bonded</b> configurations. The theoretical approach {{is based on an}} analysis of ligand-field and small-cluster Hamiltonians based on the moments of the electron state distribution. The functional forms that are obtained involve a modification of the usual expression of the binding energy as a sum of ligand-ligand interactions, which, however, requires very little increase in CPU time. The angular interactions have simple forms involving sin and cos functions, whose relative weights depend on whether the ligands are sigma- or <b>pi-bonded.</b> They describe the ligand-field stabilization energy to an accuracy of about 10 %, and the interaction energy of covalently bonded systems to an accuracy of better than 4 %. The resulting functional forms for the force field are used to model the structure of small clusters, including fragments of the copper blue protein structure. Large deviations from the typical square copper coordination are found when <b>pi-bonded</b> ligands are present...|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{starts with}} the amine (1) attacking the β carbon of the β-ketoesters (2), and eventually forming an enamine (3). The enamine then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the α-haloketone (4). This {{is followed by the}} loss of H2O, giving an imine (5). This intermediate undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic attack, forming a 5-membered ring (6). Finally, a hydrogen is eliminated and the <b>pi-bonds</b> are rearranged in the ring, yielding the final product (7).|$|E

[...] During a DAINV reaction, three <b>pi-bonds</b> are broken, and two sigma bonds and one new pi-bond are formed. A prototypical DAINV reaction is shown on the right.|$|E
50|$|Cross-{{conjugation}} is {{a special}} type of conjugation in a molecule, when {{in a set of}} three Pi bonds only two <b>pi-bonds</b> interact with each other by conjugation, the third one is excluded from interaction. Whereas a normal conjugated system such as a polyene typically has alternating single and double bonds along consecutive atoms, a cross-conjugated system has a double-bonded unit single-bonded to one of the middle atoms of another conjugated chain. In classical terms, one of the double-bonds branches off rather than continuing consecutively: the main chain is conjugated, and part of that same main chain is conjugated with the side group, but all parts are not conjugated together as strongly. Examples of cross-conjugation can be found in molecules such as benzophenone, divinylketones, p-quinones, dendralenes, radialenes, fullerene, and Indigo dye. The type of conjugation affects reactivity and molecular electronic transitions.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} {{begins with}} the extraction of a hydrogen from the nitrogen of the amide substituent and the extraction of a benzylic hydrogen from the substituent ortho to the amide substituent by a strong base. Next, the carbanion resulting from the benzylic hydrogen extraction performs a nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the amide group. When this occurs, the <b>pi-bond</b> of the amide is converted into a lone pair, creating a negatively charged oxygen. After these initial steps, strong base is no longer required and hydrolysis must occur. The negatively charged nitrogen is protonated to regain its neutral charge, and the oxygen is protonated twice to harbor a positive charge {{in order to become}} a good leaving group. A lone pair from the nitrogen forms a <b>pi-bond</b> to expel the positively charged leaving group, and also causes the nitrogen to harbor a positive charge. The final step of the reaction is an elimination reaction (specifically an E2 reaction), which involves the extraction of the other hydrogen that was once benzylic, before the bicyclic compound was formed, whose electrons are converted into a new <b>pi-bond</b> in the ring system. This allows the <b>pi-bond</b> formed by nitrogen in the preceding step to be converted back into a lone pair on nitrogen to restore nitrogen's neutral charge.|$|R
50|$|The {{types of}} bonding can be {{explained}} through in terms of orbital hybridization. In the case of acetylene each carbon atom has two sp orbitals and two p-orbitals. The two sp orbitals are linear with 180° angles and occupy the x-axis (cartesian coordinate system). The p-orbitals are perpendicular on the y-axis and the z-axis. When the carbon atoms approach each other the sp orbitals overlap to form a sp-sp sigma bond. At {{the same time the}} pz-orbitals approach and together they form a pz-pz <b>pi-bond.</b> Likewise, the other pair of py-orbitals form a py-py <b>pi-bond.</b> The result is formation of one sigma bond and two pi bonds.|$|R

50|$|The {{hydrogen}} bond {{can be compared}} with the closely related di{{hydrogen bond}}, which is also an intermolecular bonding interaction involving hydrogen atoms. These structures have been known for some time, and well characterized by crystallography; however, an understanding of their relationship to the conventional hydrogen bond, ionic bond, and covalent bond remains unclear. Generally, the hydrogen bond is characterized by a proton acceptor that is a lone pair of electrons in nonmetallic atoms (most notably in the nitrogen, and chalcogen groups). In some cases, these proton acceptors may be <b>pi-bonds</b> or metal complexes. In the dihydrogen bond, however, a metal hydride serves as a proton acceptor, thus forming a hydrogen-hydrogen interaction. Neutron diffraction has shown that the molecular geometry of these complexes is similar to hydrogen bonds, in that the bond length is very adaptable to the metal complex/hydrogen donor system.|$|E
