This thesis demonstrates the feasibility of applying a spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) system to fingertip biometric information retrieval. The results show that SD-OCT is capable of retrieving Level 3 fingertip information. Combined with traditional Level 1 and 2 fingerprint information, which can also be easily acquired by SD-OCT, the proposed application shows potential for ultra-secure scenarios.

The modelling work was part of an EPSRC-funded project, also involving biomedical engineers and computer scientists, to develop a prototype <b>PAM</b> <b>system.</b> BD is a chronic, disabling mental illness associated with recurrent severe episodes of mania and depression, interspersed with periods of remission. Early detection of the onset of an acute episode is crucial for effective treatment and control. The aim of PAM is to enable patients with BD to self-manage their condition, by identifying the person's normal ‘activity signature’ and thus automatically detecting tiny changes in behaviour patterns which could herald the possible onset of an acute episode. PAM then alerts the patient to take appropriate action in time to prevent further deterioration and possible hospitalisation. A disease state transition model for BD was developed, using data from the clinical literature, and then used stochastically in a Monte Carlo simulation to test a wide range of monitoring scenarios.
