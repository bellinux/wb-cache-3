40|$|Despite accumulating {{evidence}} for selection within natural systems, {{the importance of}} random genetic drift opposing Wright’s and Fisher’s views of evolution {{continue to be a}} subject of controversy. The geographical diversification of aposematic signals appears to be a suitable system to assess the factors involved in the process of adaptation since both theories were independently proposed to explain this phenomenon. In the present study, the effects of drift and selection were assessed from population genetics and predation experiments on <b>poison-dart</b> <b>frogs,</b> Ranitomaya imitator, of Northern Peru. We specifically focus on the transient zone between two distinct aposematic signals. In contrast to regions where high predation maintains a monomorphic aposematic signal, the transient zones are characterized by lowered selection and a high phenotypic diversity. As a result, the diversification of phenotypes may occur via genetic drift without a significant loss of fitness. These new phenotypes may then colonize alternative habitats if successfully recognized and avoided by predators. This study highlights the interplay between drift and selection as determinant processes in the adaptive diversification of aposematic signals. Results are consistent with the expectations of the Wright’s shifting balance theory an...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the evolution {{and the consequences}} of mate choice across a variety of taxa, using game theoretic, population genetic, and quantitative genetic modelling techniques. Part I is about the evolution of mate choice. In chapter 2, a population genetic model shows that mate choice is even beneficial in self-fertilising species such as Saccharomyces yeast. In chapter 3, a game theoretic model shows that female choice will be strongly dependent upon whether the benefits are fixed, so that females receive the same fitness boost from a mating with a given male regardless of how many matings that male has, or dilutable, where the more females a male mates with, the lower the expected benefit to each. This leads to the prediction that mating skew should be higher in species in which the benefits of mate choice are hypothesised to be due to good genes. Part II is about the consequences of mate choice. The theoretical prediction from chapter 3 is borne out by a literature review of studies of wild populations of birds in chapter 4. In chapter 5, a quantitative genetic model about <b>poison-dart</b> <b>frogs</b> suggests that sexual selection can speed up the e�ffect of random genetic drift. This may be of more general importance, further widening the evolutionary impact of sexual selection. Finally, in chapter 6, a game theoretic model of sperm competition shows that pre-copulatory mate choice can also have evolutionary eff�ects upon post-copulatory behaviour, aff�ecting the optimal ejaculate expenditure of males. Overall, mate choice is shown to be an important evolutionary force, with wide-ranging ramifications across diverse taxa, and e�ects so varied as to include the evolution of sex, the genetic variation in species, speciation, and post-copulatory behaviour, amongst others. These e�ffects can be e�ffectively explored using mathematical modelling...|$|E
40|$|As {{the number}} of fungal {{pathogen}} outbreaks become more frequent worldwide across taxa, so have {{the number of}} species extirpations and communities persisting with the pathogen. This phenomenon raises questions, such as: “what leads to host extinction during an outbreak?” and “how are hosts persisting once the pathogen establishes?. ” But the data on host populations and communities across life stages before and after pathogen arrival rarely exist to answer these questions. Over the past three to four decades, the amphibian-killing fungus Batrachochytrim dendrobatidis (Bd) spread in a wave-like manner across Central America, leading to rapid species extirpations and population declines. I collected data on tadpole and adult amphibians in El Copé, Panama before, during, and after the Bd outbreak to answer these questions. I used Bayesian statistical approaches to account for imperfect host and pathogen detection of marked and unmarked individuals. In the tadpole community, within 11 months of Bds arrival, density and occupancy rapidly declined. Species losses were phylogenetically correlated, with glass frogs disappearing first, and tree frogs and <b>poison-dart</b> <b>frogs</b> remaining. I found that tadpole communities resembled one another more strongly after the outbreak than they did before Bd invasion. I found no tadpoles within 22 months of the outbreak and limited signs of recovery within 10 years. In contrast, at the same site, for a population of male glass frogs, Espadarana prosopleon, I found that 10 years post-outbreak, the population was consistently half its historic abundance, and that the lack of recruits to the population explained why the population had not rebounded, rather than high pathogen-induced mortality. And finally, examining the entire amphibian community, I found high pathogen prevalence, low infection intensities, and high survival rates of uninfected and infected hosts. Bd transmission risk, i. e., the probability a susceptible host becomes infected, did not relate to host density, pathogen prevalence, or infection intensity– Bd transmission risk was uniform across the study area. My results are especially relevant to conservation biologists aiming to predict the future impacts of Bd outbreaks, those trying to manage persisting populations, and those interested in reintroducing species back into wild amphibian communities...|$|E

Small female clutch size, female-female competition, and large parental care investment by males are characteristic of sexual role reversal. as cited by [...] To test whether this sexual role reversal was true, two hypotheses were tested; the sexual role reversal hypothesis and the parental quality hypothesis. For the sexual role reversal hypothesis to be true, females would compete for as many males as possible, and this was not supported because male-male competition for mates was as common as female-female competition. In sexual role reversal males usually become more selective; however, in Dendrobates auratus females were more selective when choosing males, supporting the parental quality hypothesis, which predicted that females would compete for the parental care of particular males. Females were defensive of their mating partners and used courtship techniques to prevent males from mating with other females and destroyed rivals' eggs. These observations support the parental quality hypothesis. Summers weakens the sexual role reversal hypothesis and strengthens the case parental quality selection.|$|R

The hypothesis that females compete to monopolize the parental care of particular males was consistent with observations that: (1) females competed for males, but were more selective about mating than were males; (2) females remained near particular males and attempted to keep other females from mating with those males; (3) females may have used courtship to prevent males from mating with other females.

40|$|The {{green and}} black <b>poison-dart</b> <b>frog</b> Dendrobates auratus {{exhibits}} high intraspecific variation in hue color and pattern throughout its range, {{making it a}} very popular species in the pet trade. We analyzed the correspondence between color variation and molecular variation of D. auratus from Costa Rica using RAPD analysis. Twenty-six random primers were analyzed for variation in 99 individuals from seven populations. Color pattern was scored from digital images of the dorsal and ventral views. In general, frogs from the Caribbean coast had significantly more light coloration than black color but cannot be grouped by population based only on hue pattern. Only 3 RAPD primers {{were found to be}} polymorphic, representing a total of 16 loci. Most of the molecular variation encountered here occurs within populations, thus making unclear the degree of population structure and differentiation.

Partial Mantel correlations suggested that the pattern of molecular variation is not congruent with the variation in color pattern in this species, an outcome that is discussed in terms of phenotypic evolution.

40|$|Epibatidine (exo- 2 -(6 -chloro- 3 -pyridyl) - 7 -azabicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptane) is an {{alkaloid}} {{found on}} {{the skin of the}} Ecuadorian <b>poison-dart</b> <b>frog</b> Epipedobates tricolor. It has extremely high affinity for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and is a potent analgesic but it can not be used therapeutically as it is highly toxic. A wide range of epibatidine analogues and isomers has been produced in order to identify compounds with medicinal potential and to help elucidate the nicotinic pharmacophore. This thesis describes synthetic routes to novel epibatidine analogues, in particular, derivatives based on the 2 -azabicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptane (2 -azanorbornane) molecular framework. A general method for the synthesis of 7 -functionalised 2 -azanorbornanes has been devised. Bromination of N-benzyl- 2 -azanorborn- 5 -ene and treatment of the resulting tricyclic salt with hydride occurs with skeletal rearrangement to give N-benzyl- 7 -bromo- 2 -azanorbornane. Nucleophilic substitution reactions of this compound were found to occur with retention of configuration, consistent with neighbouring group participation of the bicyclic nitrogen lone pair. Heterocycles have been introduced at the 7 -position of 2 -azanorbornanes and manipulation of the stereochemistry at this position gave the novel epibatidine analogues isoepiboxidine and isoepibatidine. Both have very high affinity for nicotinic receptors; isoepidatidine is equipotent with epibatidine. The synthesis of fluorinated 2 -azanorbornanes was investigated leading to the synthesis of a fluorinated isoepibatidine molecule (syn- 7 -(6 -chloro-pyridin- 3 -yl) -exo- 6 -fluoro- 2 -azabicyclo-[2. 2. 1]heptane).

Ameerega shihuemoy sp. nov. {{is supported by a}} unique combination of characters: black dorsum with cream to light orange dorsolateral lines, blue belly reticulated with black, and the lack of axillary, thigh and calf flash marks. Within Ameerega, it shares the general appearance of A. altamazonica, A. boliviana, A. hahneli, A. ignipedis, A. petersi, A. picta, A. pongoensis, A. pulchripecta, A. simulans, A. smaragdina, and A. yungicola; each possessing a granular black to brown dorsum, a light labial bar, a conspicuous dorsolateral line running from the snout to the groin, and a metallic blue belly and underside of arms and hind limbs. From most of these species it can be distinguished by lacking flash marks on the axillae, thighs, and calves (absent in only A. boliviana and A. smaragdina, most A. petersi, and some A. pongoensis), by having bright cream to orange dorsolateral stripes (white, intense yellow, or green in all other species, with the exception of A. picta), and by its blue belly reticulated with black (bluish white and black in A. boliviana, green and blue with black marbling in A. petersi, and green and blue lacking black marbling in A. smaragdina). Its mating call also shows clear differences to morphologically similar species, with a lower note repetition rate, longer space between calls, and higher fundamental and dominant frequencies. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16 S mitochondrial rRNA fragment also support the distinctiveness of the new species and suggest that A. shihuemoy is most closely related to Ameerega macero, A. altamazonica, A. rubriventris, and two undescribed species (Ameerega sp. from Porto Walter, Acre, Brazil, and Ameerega sp. from Ivochote, Cusco, Peru).
