Rose's diversified into many other areas, and for many years they were associated with many household brands which produced the demand items of the day, including starch, razor blades and sweets, including Cadbury's chocolates after which the Roses selection is named. They produced seaside rock-making machines, cigarette-making machines and bread-slicing and wrapping machines. When the company closed, A.M.P Rose bought the confectionery packaging side of the business.|$|E
500|$|Olivia reveals to Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) {{about her}} {{encounter}} with her deceased lover John Scott (in the previous episode). She, Peter (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble) {{arrive at the}} scene, where they determine that the deceased were electrocuted before the impact, and that the elevator did not fall, but drove down. Furthermore, Walter detects electromagnetic energy in the area. Meanwhile, Meegar inadvertently causes a <b>packaging</b> <b>machine</b> to malfunction, severely injuring his boss right after Meegar is fired. He later reveals to his mother that some time ago he answered a magazine advertisement promising to [...] "unlock [...] hidden potential", and although he has no knowledge {{of what has been}} done to him, he believes that what he has done was a result of being experimented on. A further panicked Meegar then causes his mother's pacemaker to fail, and she dies.|$|E

50|$|Passenger {{services}} {{on the line}} were terminated on 31 December 1954.

50|$|In 1935, {{after the}} National Recovery Act was {{declared}} unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, PMMI veered from their mission as {{a defender of}} packaging practices against the regulation of the NRA, to a role of homogenizing the packaging processes. <b>Packaging</b> <b>machine</b> designs of that period {{were the result of}} individual requirements from the company to the inventor-entrepreneur.|$|E

40|$|Manufacturers {{and users}} of <b>packaging</b> <b>machines</b> are facing two {{significant}} challenges: {{the improvement of}} the sustainability and the enhancement of the format flexibility. The sustainability of products is becoming a more important influencing factor for the consumer buying behavior. Therefore, the increase of the energy and resource efficiency of <b>packaging</b> <b>machines</b> is a very promising strategy to achieve this goal. At first glance no correlation between format flexibility and sustainability seems to exist. But in fact, both topics partly depend on each other. These connections are the focus of this paper. Exemplary for sustainability, the resource and energy efficiency in the context of <b>packaging</b> <b>machines</b> will be considered. As a further detailing, this paper also contains an experimental investigation of a more format flexible and sustainable processing technology for sealing. Therefore, the heat-impulse technology was investigated...|$|R

50|$|According to the FruitGuys website, an {{integral}} part of the company’s socially responsible approach is its commitment to using eco-friendly packaging. All boxes used are made of 75 to 100 percent post-consumer recycled cardboard, printed with soy-based inks and reused up to four times. The company also uses a custom-made <b>packaging</b> <b>machine</b> that cuts down on cardboard use by 40 percent.|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} {{sequential control}} system may trigger {{a series of}} mechanical actuators in the correct sequence to perform a task. For example, various electric and pneumatic transducers may fold and glue a cardboard box, fill it with product and then seal it in an automatic <b>packaging</b> <b>machine.</b> Programmable logic controllers are used in many cases such as this, but several alternative technologies exist.|$|E

50|$|This {{data can}} be used to {{determine}} if an issue exists with an upstream filling, or <b>packaging,</b> <b>machine.</b> A checkweigher can send a signal to the machine to increase or decrease the amount put into a package. This can result in a payback associated with the checkweigher since producers will be better able to control the amount of give-away. See checkweigher case study outlining ground beef and packaging savings.|$|E

50|$|Roll {{slitting}} is {{a technique}} heavily used by Converters (industry). The converter industry normally refers to companies who print, coat and laminate materials. A typical converter {{is a company that}} produces flexible packaging material for packaging food. This may involve purchasing large rolls of plastic film such as biaxially orientated polypropylene (BOPP) which is then printed to the customer's design and coated with cold seal adhesive for use on high speed packaging machines. This material is printed and coated in wide, large diameter rolls for maximum efficiency. The rolls are then slit, using a slitting machine, into smaller rolls of the size to be used on the <b>packaging</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
