25|$|Lodner D. Phillips {{designed}} the first wholly enclosed ADS in 1856. His design comprised a barrel-shaped upper torso with domed ends and included {{ball and socket}} joints in the articulated arms and legs. The arms had joints at shoulder and elbow, and the legs at knee and hip. The suit included a ballast tank, a viewing <b>port,</b> <b>entrance</b> through a manhole cover on top, a hand-cranked propeller, and rudimentary manipulators {{at the ends of}} the arms. Air was to be supplied from the surface via hose. There is no indication, however, Phillips' suit was ever constructed.|$|E
25|$|When the German Army {{invaded the}} Netherlands in May 1940, the Royal Netherlands Navy made a plan which {{involved}} scuttling Jan Pieterszoon Coen {{at the entrance}} of the port of IJmuiden in order to prevent German warships entering the harbor. The plan was set in motion in the night of 14 May 1940, Captain R. van Rees Vellinga sailed Jan Pieterszoon Coen from Amsterdam to IJmuiden. Once there, the ship was supposed to be escorted to the harbor entrance by two tugboats, but they were accidentally sunk too early. As a solution to the problem, The Royal Netherlands Navy ordered the tugboat Atjeh and a minesweeper to tow the ship into place. The tugboat and minesweeper towed the ship into place with much difficulty due to the tide change. The ship was positioned with the bow to the Southern pier and the stern to the Northern pier of the <b>port</b> <b>entrance.</b> The explosives which were previously installed on the ship were detonated and the ship sank between the piers. Her upper decks were still sticking out of the water due to the shallow depths. The plan was successful and the ship prohibited German ships to enter the harbor, the Netherlands however surrendered to the Axis powers and was occupied by Nazi-Germany.|$|E
500|$|Fort Risban, {{located on}} the coast on the Avenue Raymond Poincaré at the <b>port</b> <b>entrance,</b> was built by the English to prevent {{supplies}} reaching Calais by sea during the siege in November 1346 and continued to be occupied by them until 1558 when Calais was restored to France. In 1596, the fort was captured by the Spanish Netherlands until May 1598 when it was returned to the French following the Treaty of Vervins. It was rebuilt in 1640. Vauban, who visited the fort {{some time in the}} 1680s, described it as [...] "a home for owls, and place to hold the Sabbath" [...] rather than a fortification. During World War II it served as an air raid shelter. It contains the Lancaster Tower, a name often given to the fort itself.|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 7 December 1941, Chew was moored in Berth X-5, {{alongside}} Allen and the decommissioned , which was being used for storage. At {{the outbreak of the}} attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan that morning, Chew brought one of her 3"/23 caliber guns online and began firing at 08:03, under the command of her executive officer. At 08:11, two of her [...]50 caliber machine guns were also brought online and began firing. The [...] gun scored one Japanese aircraft shot down and two damaged, and the machine guns observed no hits. Chew maintained continuous fire from these weapons until 09:34, when the last of the Japanese aircraft departed. She then got underway and began patrolling for Japanese submarine activity, just southwest of the <b>port</b> <b>entrance</b> buoy. She pinged eight possible contacts and dropped 28 depth charges, which her commander, H. R. Hummer, Jr., reported two Japanese submarines destroyed. Subsequent evidence does not suggest Chew struck any Japanese submarines. In the chaos of the attack, a number of Chew crew members also disembarked and came aboard nearby , which was in drydock, to assist in manning guns, forming ammunition trains, and fighting fires. Aboard Pennsylvania, two Chew crewman were killed in defending the ship, Seaman Second Class Matthew J. Agola and Fireman Third Class Clarence A. Wise.|$|E

25|$|The port is {{the home}} of a major oil storage and {{terminal}} facility, located on the small island of Aghios Pavlos ("Saint Paul") at the <b>port's</b> <b>entrance.</b> The facility has four shore-based storage tanks containing fuel oil and gasoil, pumps of 1,000 cubic metres per hour capacity and three loading docks. The terminal's maximum draft of 40 feet (13.45 metres) enables the facility to handle oil tankers of up to approximately two hundred thousand metric tons of deadweight.|$|R

5000|$|Submarine mining was the laying of {{defensive}} mines on the seabed about <b>port</b> <b>entrances.</b> In 1898 the New Zealand forces commander advised {{the government that}} Ellen Ballance was dangerous for laying out mines in anything approaching bad weather. He recommended that two [...] "proper" [...] submarine minelaying steamers should be acquired, one for Auckland and one for Wellington. This was approved, and in October 1900 the construction of two enlarged Napier of Magdala type vessels were ordered. These were named Janie Seddon and Lady Roberts.|$|R
2500|$|The Finnish Navy was {{informed}} that the 8,800 ton Soviet icebreaker [...] would be arriving in the Baltic Sea from the Atlantic. Vetehinen was sortied to intercept the icebreaker off the port of Liepāja on 4 December. However, the submarine ran aground before reaching open sea {{and had to be}} pulled loose by tugs before it was able to start its voyage. Vetehinen arrived at the site on 6 December and started patrolling off the buoy on the <b>port</b> <b>entrance.</b> On 7 December the submarine sighted Yermak but was unable to reach it. While on station, Vetehinen encountered a couple of unknown submarines which were suspected to be of German origin. On 8 December Vetehinen began the voyage home and was attacked by the Soviet [...] , but the attack failed and the Finnish submarine crew did not even notice the attempt.|$|E

5|$|Despite a {{declaration}} from the German Governor Heinrich Schnee {{that neither the}} harbour nor its ships {{would be used for}} military purposes, the decision was taken by British Admiral Herbert King-Hall that the shipping in the port must nevertheless be neutralised.

With close-range bombardment impossible, the British assembled assault teams with volunteers from the small blockading flotilla. Their mission was to augment the existing blockage by immobilising or sinking those cargo ships trapped in the port, thus denying its use to the Germans as well.

50|$|On {{the night}} of 20 August 1857, the ship {{approached}} the entrance to Sydney Harbour from the south, but heavy rain and a strong gale made navigating difficult.

The force of the gale caused the Dunbar to break up. Crew member James Johnson was thrown against the cliffs from the impetus of the collision and managed to scramble to safety, however he remained undiscovered for two days. The remainder of the passengers and crew were drowned. A day of public mourning was declared.
