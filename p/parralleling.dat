Strategic management scholars and researchers have found empirically that an organization 2 ̆ 7 s performance is predominantly related to factors in its competitive market positions and organizational resources.

40|$|Mesembryanthemum crystallinum {{exhibits}} induction of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) after {{a threshold}} stage of development, {{by exposure to}} long days with high light intensities or by water and salt stress. During the CAM cycle, fluctuations in carbon partitioning within the cell lead to transient drops in osmotic potential, which are likely stabilized/balanced by passive movement of water via aquaporins (AQPs). Protoplast swelling assays were used to detect changes in water permeability during the day/night cycle of CAM. To assess the role of AQPs during the same period, we followed transcript accumulation and protein abundance of four plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) and one tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP). CAM plants showed a persistent rhythm of specific AQP protein abundance changes throughout the day/night cycle, including changes in amount of McPIP 2; 1, McTIP 1; 2, McPIP 1; 4 and McPIP 1; 5, while the abundance of McPIP 1; 2 was unchanged.

Sterile water and molasses were served as controls. Azotobacter chroococcum effect also was studied either alone or in combination with the effective microorganisms on the growth parameters.

My study consisted of 12 interviews and a survey with a take of 76 espondents. My fieldwork was done in the summer of 2011, in the three major cities of Finland: Helsinki, Turku and Tampere.

In my research I found that polyamorists were using consensuality to actively create their relationships and themselves as individuals. This was done in opposition to marriage, but it was in relation to a specifically Finnish ideal of relationships being based on equality. In their attempts to recreate equality in <b>parrallel</b> relationships through consensuality, polyamorists were at the same time adhering to ideals as they were changing the normative forms of relationships.

However, from the medical institution side, there are some problems which need to be resolved in order to carry out IPMS smoothly. To solve these problems, an experimental investigation using a model medicine was conducted in our institution. At the same time, the research on the status of efforts and activities made by pharmaceutical companies toward IPMS was conducted, followed by problem analysis in implementation of IPMS and a review of the countermeasures. The main problems found in the new IPMS operation is the lack of cooperation from medical institutions. In order to obtain cooperation from the medical institutions, some incentives are needed, such as, limiting medical institutions for the use of a new developed medicine or design a contract between the pharmaceutical company and medical institution. Two types of contractual coverage are available; one is to provide the prescriber list to medical representative (MR) in written form, and the other is to provide the ADR information collected in the clinical setting by pharmacists in addition to the prescriber list. And, as a contact point of MR visit, the drug information service center may be considered. Moreover, a model was created based on the contract betweena a pharmaceutical company and medical institution for conducting IPMS effectively and smoothly in the medical institution.

Stump pyometra is the infection and luminal purulent dis-tention of the uterine tissue remaining from the in-complete removal of ovaries and/or uterine tissues in ovariohysterectomy operations (Johnston et al., 2001). Okkens et al. (1981) have reported various complications of ovariohysterectomy in 109 cases as incomplete removal of the ovaries, reactions of surgical suture material, flank fistules and intraab-dminal adhesions affecting the functions of other organs, while stump pyometra was found in 20 % of the cases, either alone or along with the other complications. In the above and in another clini-cal report (Pearson, 1973; Okkens et al., 1981) it was observed that 58 % (n = 19) and 71 % (n = 7) of uterine stump pyometra cases there is also func-tional ovarian tissue present. This is considered as important evidence of hormonal influence, es-pecially progesterone secretion which is essential in the formation of stump pyometra (Nelson et Feldman, 1986; Johnston et al., 2001). Major clinical symptoms of stump pyometra are similar to that of Pyometra/Cystic Endomerial Hyperplasia, which are like haemorrhagic and/or purulent vaginal discharge, depression and anorexia while incrase in total WBC and total protein levels are often observed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the interaction of a finely focussed light beam and a semiconductor. The object of the work is to develop a consistent theory which explains the formation of both the optical beam induced current and photoluminescence signals with a view to using these techniques to characterize semiconductor materials. Here we extend previous theories by considering a light beam which is focussed through a lens of finite numerical aperture. Expressions are derived which give the distribution of excess minority carriers injected into a semi-infinite semiconductor by the focussed light beam. The injected minority carrier distribution is then used to predict the imaging properties of the optical beam induced current and photoluminescence techniques when used to image electrically active defects in semiconductors. High resolution scanning photoluminescence images of indium phosphide are presented showing a resolution which is in good agreement with theory. The form of both the steady state and time dependent optical beam induced current in Schottky barrier diodes, planar junction diodes and devices where the p-n junction is perpendicular to the semiconductor surface is derived. Various methods are suggested for measuring the minority carrier diffusion length and lifetime. An extension to previous analyses is given by considering the effect of scanning the light beam, at some arbitrary velocity, on the form of the optical beam induced current collected by a p-n junction either <b>parrallel</b> or perpendicular to the semiconductor surface. It is also shown how the scan speed can effect the imaging of electrically active defects producing a contrast function which is asymmetric and reduced in magnitude. An analysis of the photoluminescence signal generated from a semi-infinite semiconductor by a finely focussed light beam is given. Various methods based on the photoluminescence technique are suggested for measuring the minority carrier lifetime. </p...|$|R
40|$|Some Notes on the Fencing of the Non-catholic Cemeteries in Leghorn]. Livorno in {{the early}} modern period hosted a unique and {{extraordinary}} complex of languages, religions and customs. <b>Parrallel</b> to the living city, where Italians, Jews, Dutch, British, Armenians, Greeks and Turks, communicated, traded and quarreled with one other, there existed segregated cities of the dead. In the general history of the “nations” of Livorno that of non-Catholic cemeteries {{is a very important}} chapter in which much remains to be investigated. In this essay, Stefano Villani reconstructs the controversy that followed the request to fence off the land where English Protestants were buried {{since the end of the}} sixteenth century. The Inquisition decidedly opposed this concession seeking to emphasize, symbolically, the unworthiness of those who died outside the Catholic Church while simultaneously fearing that a physical screen mighted be used to hide Protestant ceremonies. Consequently, it was only in 1706 that the cemetery could be enclosed by a little wall and iron fencing. The opposition on the part of the Catholic Church to any concession seems to have been driven by the fear that similar privileges could ingenerate a kind of plebeian Latitudinarianism. This was spurred by the fear that concessions might popularize the notion that it was socially acceptable to be Christian without belonging to the Catholic Church, and that Catholic rites were not fundamental to salvation rather than the hypothetical conversion of Livornese to Protestantism. This was a scandal that the Catholic Church sought to avoid. For the English, demands of religious freedom had an eminently symbolic meaning related closely to their identity and dignity: it was perceived as humiliating for English merchants, some very rich, to bury their relatives in an open field where dogs could roam as they pleased, and to have to send their children to be baptized in a Catholic church. Thus the requests for a minister and a fenced cemetery seem to have been motivated more by social prestige than by religious questions. The Dutch, English and Jewish burial places were outside the city walls and although they were unfenced it was not coincidental that they contained sumptuous funeral monuments, sometimes of marble and artistically sculptured...|$|R
40|$|Plasma and {{magnetic}} field {{data from the}} International Sun-Earth Explorer ISEE 2 spacecraft recorded during an outbound crossing of the dayside, northern hemisphere magnetopause in October 29, 1979, provide evidence for a slow shock (SS) in the observed reconnection layer. This layer {{is found to be}} bounded on the magnetosheath side by the SS; near the magnetospheric side of the layer, a second current sheet is found that may have been rotational discontinuity (RD). The direction of the accelerated plasma flow, the earthward sense of the normal magnetic filed across the SS and RD, and the relative orientation of the SS and the RD all indicate that the reconection site was located south of the spacecraft. Quantitative tests show that, allowing for experiemental uncertanties, data taken upstream and downstream of the SS are consistent with coplanarity and other Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) conditions. Examiniations of the flow parameters indicates two anomalous properties of the SS: the upstream flow, viewed in the deHoffmann-Teller frame, is superalfvenic and the downstream plasma is firehose unstable. In comparison to the long-wavelength slow-mode phase speed, however, the flow in the upstream region is super slow, while in the downstream region it is subslow, as requeired for a slow-mode shock. Further properties of the shock include a large decrease in total enthalpy across it, indicating the escape of a sizable heat flux from the shock structure, and the occurrence of a polarization reversal of the tangential magnetic field within the shock layer, a feature that is predicted by linear double-polytropic Hall-MHD and results from a large increase in pressure anistropy from the upstream region, where p(sub parallel) approximately equal to p(sub perp), to the downstream region, where p(sub <b>parrallel)</b> greater than p(sub perp). Quantitative tests of the RD-like discontinuity show that it satisfies the necessary RH conditions within experimental uncertainties and indicate that the flow across it is earthward, that is, it is the same as for the SS. Thus the RD is propagating behind the SS in the direction away from the Earth. The reversal in the order of the discontinuities is attributed to the reversal of the slow and intermediate phase speeds produced by the pressure anistropy in the region between the RD and the SS. The linear dispersion relation and polarization properties of dispersive MHD waves in an anisotropic plasma are examined in the appendix...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a growing need for a variety of custom {{tailored}} instrumentation equipment to serve in advanced nuclear applications. Most of todays of the shelf electronics (ADCs, amplifiers, pressure sensors, multiplexers [...] .) are not specified to meet the demanding requirements in these environments. This article reports on the design of an ADC suitable for use with the discrete time switched capacitor instrumentation amplifiers and reports on a multiplexer to interface multiple ADCs. The circuit in this article is intended for use in remote handling equipment in the ITER fusion reactor and may be subjected to an ionizing radiation and high temperature environment. In addition, it could serve for various other applications requiring a guaranteed functionality in these extreme environments. Examples of these applications are the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN and the MYRRHA (Multi-purpose Hybrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) reactor which is being developed at SCK-CEN, The Belgian Nuclear Research Centre in Mol, Belgium and even complex space applications. In the presentation a radiation tolerant delta Sigma ADC and multiplexer will be presented. The ADC features a 1. 5 V, 17 bit Delta Sigma ADC consuming 4. 35 mW for a 1 kHz bandwidth. The sample frequency is 1 MHz. The ADC utilizes a correlated double sampling technique (CDS) to remove offset and 1 /f noise. The 17 bit resolution is maintained upon a simulated radiation dose exceeding 1 MGy and varying temperatures between 0 ∘C and 85 ∘C. In this work there is chosen for CDS (correlated double sampling) instead of CHS (Chopper stabilization) because it intrinsically removes offset instead of modulating it to a higher frequency. Controlling the offset and hence also the 1 /f-noise is of importance as these tend to increase under radiation. Note that an increased offset could severely limit the dynamic performance of the ADC. Furthermore the conversion of pressure and temperature signals requires a low bandwidth (< 1 kHz). Because 1 /f noise dominates in this signalband, the CDS technique is the preferred solution. In this article a delta sigma ADC will be shown which makes use of the CDS technique. A Delta-Sigma modulator is the most suitable architecture as its envisaged application in the conversion of pressure and temperature signals requires a low bandwidth (< 1 kHz) and high resolution (up to 17 bit). Furthermore Delta-Sigma ADCs are less prone to mismatch since no resistive dividers or matched current mirrors are necessary as in a flash ADC. A Delta-Sigma ADC can use a single bit conversion which makes it more robust to process variations and mismatch. Since the ADC is planned for use in an extreme environment where transistor parameters are affected by varying temperatures and influences of radiation the ADCs robustness is critical. Next a multiplexer will be presented. The multiplexer is able to interface multiple channels <b>parrallel</b> at its input and converts this data into a serial datastream. It can multiplex 256 channels at a clock frequency of 128 MHz or has a data throughput of 256 MSample/s. The multiplexer will drastically reduce the number of cables in the instrumentation network. In addition the simulated radiation and temperature tolerance was found to be outstanding. Finally, together with a previously designed instrumentation amplifier, the ADC and multiplexer form a radiation tolerant ASIC which can interface more than hundred pressure and/or resistive sensors. status: publishe...|$|R
