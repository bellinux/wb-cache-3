40|$|This {{research}} is aimed {{to generate a}} model for official letter translation from English to Indonesian and vice versa. This study is a multiyear research planned to be conducted for two years. Research {{in the first year}} focuses on exploring the patterns of English and Indonesian official letters and studying the quality of the translation produced by amateur translators. The patterns of official letter and the information about the translation quality will then be used as the foundation for generating the <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>model</b> for official letter translation. The data analyzed in this research consist of official letters in English and bahasa Indonesia and their translation and statements {{about the quality of the}} translation. The analysis was done in several stages. First, analyzing the characteristics of official letters in English and official letters in bahasa Indonesia. Second, analyzing the quality of the translation of the letters by referring to the statements of the informants. Next, constructing the <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>model</b> for translating official letter from English into bahasa Indonesia and vice versa. Offical letters written in English and those written in bahasa Indonesia have both similarities and differences. There are only minor problems of the translation of the official letters in terms of message transfer but there are some problems dealing with the naturalness of the translation. In translating official letter, a translator needs to understand the characteristics of official letter in both SL and TL and use the proper techniques...|$|E
40|$|Cloud storage {{has emerged}} as a popular {{paradigm}} to outsource data to third party and share it with the collaborators. While this new paradigm enables users to outsource their sensitive data and reduces data management costs, it brings forth the new challenges to the user to keep their data secure. Data storage security and access control in the cloud is one of the challenging ongoing research works to alleviate the data leakage problem from unauthorized users. Existing solutions that use pure cryptographic techniques suffers from heavy computation work with respect to key management and key distribution.   Attribute based encryption is an alternative solution that map the user access structure with the data file attributes to control the data access. However any of the existing schemes doesn’t address the access control with assured deletion of the files upon revocation of user access. This article addresses this open issue using a trusted authority that manages the access control list and takes care of key management and key distribution and file deletion upon user revocation. The <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>model</b> has been presented and analyzed the security features over existing scheme...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{will be done}} for 3 years (3 phases). The first year had been done on 2013 ago. 2014 is {{the second year of}} research (phase II). Research phase of this study (second year), namely development phase: the <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> <b>model</b> is developed to be a model. The activities carried out in phase II include: expert validation test, readability test, revision, kindergarten teacher training, limited trial, and the trial was extended to find models that fit between the theoretical concepts with empirical data in the field. And finally (second year), from all kindergarten which be the sample study, it was found that all kindergarten were using the general assessment without special assessment for development of children’s language, so it is necessary to create assessment “PLST” to detect the development of language skill for early childhood (kindergarten student). It has to continue in second to third year. The final research, which {{is at the end of}} the third year (phase III) is expected to match model assessment “PLST” as well as the guidance in learning in kindergarten, which can be used by teachers to detect and monitor the development of language skills, identifying the amount of vocabulary and sentences are mastered children, and the stages of language development next. To achieve these objectives, the researcher adopted a model of research, development, and diffusion by Hopkins & Clark (Havelock, 1976...|$|E

30|$|However, it {{is worth}} noting to state that the limited {{application}} <b>of</b> the <b>models</b> do not validate them on statistic terms, in such way that this study also serves as an incentive for the creation <b>of</b> new <b>prototypes</b> <b>of</b> <b>models</b> and applications for the management of corporate happiness. It is also important that other cases, for example, of low scores in the MATO model, would be highlighted in future researches. The concept of corporate happiness will be increasingly present in the academic world in posterior developed studies. It is expected, concluding that this study contributes for the spread of the concepts of happiness and that its relevance can be more general and applied in our society.|$|R
