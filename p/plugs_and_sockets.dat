25|$|A {{number of}} {{standards}} {{based on two}} round pins with centres spaced at 19mm are in use in continental Europe and elsewhere, {{most of these are}} listed in IEC/TR 60083 Plugs and socket-outlets for domestic and similar general use standardized in member countries of IEC. There is no European Union regulation of domestic mains <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets,</b> the Low Voltage Directive specifically excludes domestic <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets.</b> EU countries each have their own regulations and national standards, for example some require child-resistant shutters, others do not.

25|$|De facto {{standards}} became formalised as official {{national and}} international standards. Old installations with obsolete sockets exist. The International Electrotechnical Commission in 1934 established technical committee TC 23 for electrical fittings. Only two meetings were held before {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War. In Europe, since 1951 the International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment (CEE) has published a standard (CEE 7 Specification for Plugs and Socket-Outlets for Domestic and Similar Purposes) describing the <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> used. In 1953 the CEE published Technical Report 83 (later 60083), which was a listing of <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> then in use. In North America the National Electrical Manufacturers' Association (NEMA) publishes standards for <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets.</b>|$|E

This smaller pin in {{the centre of the}} connector is shorter than the others, designed to 'make' after all the other pins when connecting a <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket,</b> <b>and</b> to 'break' first when disconnecting. It is used to switch off the load. This is useful as disconnecting under load will cause arcing which may cause damage to both the <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket,</b> <b>and</b> risk injury to the user.|$|R

25|$|A {{patent for}} this {{obsolete}} American {{plug and socket}} was filed in 1915 under US patent 1,179,728. It predated the NEMA sockets and plugs.

25|$|The Swiss standard, {{also used}} in Liechtenstein, is SN SEV1011:2009 Plugs and socket-outlets for {{household}} and similar purposes.

Sockets will accept plugs with the same or fewer pins and the same or lower ratings.|$|E
25|$|Permanently {{installed}} electrical equipment, unless {{not required}} to, have permanently connected grounding conductors. Portable electrical devices with metal cases may have them connected to earth ground by a pin on the attachment plug (see Domestic AC power <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets).</b> The size of power grounding conductors is usually regulated by local or national wiring regulations.|$|E
2500|$|SANS 164-4 defines three {{variants}} of the 16A <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> intended for specialist (known as [...] "dedicated") applications. [...] The variants use a flattened earth pin, each {{at a different}} specified rotational position. [...] This arrangement ensures that the dedicated plugs can all plug into an ordinary ("non-dedicated") socket, but that the various dedicated <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> combinations are not interchangeable (nor can a non-dedicated plug be inserted into a dedicated socket).|$|R

25|$|Italian <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> {{are defined}} by the {{standard}} CEI23-50 which superseded CEI23-16. This includes models rated at 10A and 16A that differ in contact diameter and spacing (see below for details). Both are symmetrical, allowing the line and neutral contacts to be inserted in either direction. This plug is also commonly used in Chile and Uruguay.|$|E
25|$|This {{style of}} connector, {{produced}} by Italian manufacturer BTicino, {{appeared in the}} 1960s and was intended {{as an alternative to}} the Europlug or CEI 23-16 connectors then in use. The socket is an almost rectangular socket, with one or more lateral key pins and indentations to prevent inverting the polarised plug, or connecting <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> with different current ratings. At least four models were produced: three single-phase general purpose connectors rated respectively 10 A, 16 A and 20 A; plus a three-phase industrial connector rated 10 A; all of them have different key-pin positioning so <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> cannot be mismatched. The socket is closed by a safety lid (bearing the word ‚Äò‚ÄôMagic‚Äô‚Äô on it) which can be opened only with an even pressure on its surface, thus preventing the insertion of objects (except the plug itself) inside the socket. The contacts are blades positioned on both sides of the plug; the plug is energized only when it is inserted fully into the socket.|$|E
25|$|The <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> used {{to power}} {{electric}} stoves from a single-phase line {{have to be}} rated for greater current values than ones for three-phase system because all the power has to be transferred through a single line. Electric stoves are often hardwired to the electrical supply system, connected to the mains with an appropriate high power industrial connector or with non-standard high power proprietary domestic connector (as some countries do not have wiring regulations for single-phase electric stoves). In Russia an electric stove can often be seen connected with a 25 to 32A connector.|$|E

5000|$|This is {{identical}} to the BS 546 15 ampere <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket,</b> although in South Africa it is rated for 16 A for compatibility with the IEC 60898 standard current ratings.|$|R
25|$|Consolidation of {{standards}} eases {{international trade and}} travel. For example, the CEE7/7 plug has been adopted in several European countries and is compatible with both CEE7/3 and CEE7/5 sockets, while the unearthed and unpolarised CEE 7/16 Europlug is compatible with even more European and other socket types. IEC 60906-1 has been proposed as a common standard for all 230 V <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> worldwide but has been adopted only in South Africa so far, with a modified version used in Brazil. IEC 60906-2 recognizes the wide use of the NEMA 5-15 parallel blade plug and socket and recommends it for all 120 V applications.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> are {{designed}} as a system to meet standards for safety and reliability. Some types of socket may accept more than one type of plug; where this is an official, approved intention of the socket design, all the approved combinations will be tested to the applicable safety standards. Occasionally, plug and socket combinations may allow power to flow but may not meet product standards for mating force, earthing, current capacity, life expectancy, or safety. Improvised or user-modified connectors will not meet the product safety standards. Adaptors between different standards can overcome mechanical incompatibility. Physical compatibility does not ensure that the appliance and socket match in frequency or voltage.|$|E
25|$|These {{unearthed}} plugs {{with two}} flat parallel blades {{are intended for}} use on 240 volt circuits. The 2‚Äê15 has coplanar current blades, and is used for 240V service at 15A, while the 2‚Äê20 has the blades at 90¬∞ relative to each other (one vertical, one horizontal) and is used for 240 V service at 20A. NEMA 2 <b>plugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> are rare because they are unearthed and so, no longer permitted for new installations. They have no neutral. In some cases these plugs can be inserted into incorrect-voltage sockets. Prior {{to the adoption of}} the NEMA standard, a plug nearly identical to the 2‚Äê20 was used for 120V at 20A. That obsolete plug would fit into 5‚Äê20 and 6‚Äê20 sockets, which supply different voltages, but will not fit a NEMA 2‚Äê20 socket.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> appear {{physically}} {{identical to}} NEMA1-15. The Japanese system incorporates stricter dimensional {{requirements for the}} plug housing, different marking requirements, and mandatory testing and approval by METI or JIS.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of three}} phase <b>plug</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> are mainly used in {{households}} in ex. Yugoslavian countries, they are 5-pin 3-phase connectors, rated at 16 A, 380 V. Industrial 3-phase connectors are same as European IEC 60309.|$|R
