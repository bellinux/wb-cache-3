John Lackey induced two flyouts against Matt Adams and David Freese, before the runners advanced on a wild pitch, but Lackey ended the threat by striking out Jon Jay. In the same inning the first two batters for the Red Sox reached base, a single by Jonny Gomes and a walk by Shane Victorino, but after back-to-back <b>popouts</b> into foul territory by Xander Bogaerts and Stephen Drew, David Ross struck out. Jacoby Ellsbury lead off the third inning with a single and Pedroia advanced him to second on a groundout. With first base open, Michael Wacha intentionally walked David Ortiz, Ortiz's second walk of the game, and struck out Mike Napoli but then drilled Gomes and {{with the bases loaded}} Victorino hit a double off the Green Monster, his first hit in this series, scoring all three runners. Victorino just missed his second grand slam of this postseason but Wacha's streak ended, who to this point had not allowed a hit {{with runners in scoring position}} this October. Bogaerts lined out to third base to end the inning. In the top of the fourth, the just awarded AL Golden Glove winner on second base, Dustin Pedroia, committed a fielding error on a possible double play ball with one out and Craig on first. Lackey pitched out of the jam on a flyout by Adams and striking out Freese. On the first pitch in the bottom of the fourth, Drew homered into the Red Sox bullpen and Ellsbury followed him with a double. After a flyout by Pedroia which advanced Ellsbury to third, Ortiz was again intentionally walked. Cardinals manager Mike Matheny tried to stop the bleeding and replaced his rookie starter with game 4 losing pitcher Lance Lynn, who quickly warmed up after Drew went yard earlier in this inning. Lynn could not make an out as Napoli drove in Ellsbury on a single, Gomes drew a walk to load the bases and Victorino collected his fourth RBI on a base hit which scored Ortiz from third. Seth Maness relieved Lynn and ended the inning by striking out Bogaerts. Michael Wacha left the game with six earned runs in 3 2/3 innings of work. Prior to this game he posted a 1.00 ERA in the postseason. The Cardinals threatened again in the fifth after a leadoff hit by John Jay, a one out single by Carpenter and a flyout to right field by Carlos Beltrán, which advanced Jay to third. But Lackey induced another flyout against Matt Holliday. St. Louis brought in their fourth arm of the night in the bottom of the fifth, Kevin Siegrist. After two quick outs, Ellsbury reached on a fielding error by Matt Carpenter and was then in a rundown, after he took off too early on a steal attempt. Siegrist misplayed his position on first base, standing too far away, and Ellsbury safely returned to the bag. Lackey got two quick outs in the top of the seventh, before Daniel Descalso hit a long single into right field and Carpenter followed him with a double to left field, advancing the runner to third. Beltrán drove in the Cardinal's first run on a left field single into the shift and advanced on a wild pitch. Lackey walked Holliday to load the bases before he was relieved by Junichi Tazawa. He induced a ground ball against Allen Craig to first base, Mike Napoli bobbled the ball but could recover in time and Tazawa, covering first base, got the out. With Ellsbury on first, Pedroia grounded into a fielder's choice in the bottom of the eighth, which ended his streak of reaching base safely in 20 consecutive postseason games at home. In a non-save situation, the Red Sox brought in their closer Koji Uehara, in relief of Brandon Workman, who worked a quiet eighth inning. John Jay flew out to Gomes, Descalso popped out to Gomes and Carpenter struck out and the Red Sox clinched their eighth World Series.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In 1988, Connect- 4 {{became the}} second non-trivial board game to be solved. <b>PopOut</b> is {{a variant of}} Connect- 4 that was {{released}} in 2009. <b>PopOut</b> allows both players to "pop" disks from the bottom row in addition to dropping new disks from above. Connect- 4 is a divergent game where the maximum depth of the game tree is 42. Because of the pop moves, <b>PopOut</b> is not divergent but unchangeable and this causes the maximum depth to be much larger. Furthermore, <b>PopOut</b> allows positions to be repeated making the Graph History Interaction (GHI) problem possible. It is not fully understood why some games have been solved while others remain unsolved. Connect- 4 and <b>PopOut</b> are similar games but they have slight changes in some game characteristics. The biggest {{of these is the}} change in convergence type. There has not been a previous reported attempt to solve <b>PopOut.</b> By analyzing the game, more light is shed on the relationship between game characteristics and solvability. We studied whether the search techniques that have been used in solving Connect- 4 are also applicable to <b>PopOut</b> and how they should be modified or augmented to be effective. Proof-number search was able to weakly solve <b>PopOut</b> with no modifications. Alpha-beta with its standard enhancements needed heavier modifications to counteract the depth of the game tree and to circumvent the GHI problem. The game-tree depth was successfully limited by “handicapping” the first player. The first player was prohibited from making non-winning pop moves and any game exceeding a chosen number of moves was declared a loss for the first player. Alpha-beta was able to show that the first player still wins under these handicapping rules. The handicapping technique was essential in solving the game with Alpha-beta. The technique has not been used previously but it might also be applicable to other board games and search algorithms. <b>PopOut</b> is a first-player win on the standard board size 7 x 6. Smaller board sizes are either first-player wins or draws by repetition. Some of the smaller boards were strongly solved by retrograde analysis which performed a total enumeration of the state space. No contradictions were found between the three different solving approaches suggesting that the results are reliable...|$|E

40|$|Crowding {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} in which nearby distractors impede target processing. This effect is reduced as target– distractor distance increases, and it is eliminated entirely at a distance that is labeled the critical spacing point. Attention, distractor preview, and <b>popout</b> are each known to facilitate processing in crowded displays. Eight experiments examined whether this is accomplished via a reduction in critical spacing. Attention was manipulated via spatial cueing, whereby a peripheral cue elicited a stimulus-driven shift of attention. Distractor preview was examined by manipulating whether the crowding distractors were presented prior to or simultaneous with the target. <b>Popout</b> was examined by manipulating {{whether there was a}} salient color difference between the target and distractors. As demonstrated in previous studies, we found robust benefits of spatial cueing, preview, and <b>popout</b> in crowded displays. However, although spatial cueing led to robust improvements in target discrimination, there was no reduction in critical spacing for attended stimuli. By contrast, both preview and <b>popout</b> caused large reductions in critical spacing.

40|$|Although {{very little}} visual {{information}} is explicitly retained across views, some continuity of processing is afforded by implicit visual memory traces of previous views. These memory traces interact with attentional mechanisms to guide eye movements, cognition, and action. Two different memory mechanisms are described here. First, the deployments of focal attention and eye movements are facilitated towards recently attended features and locations (priming of <b>popout).</b> Second, attention {{is guided by}} implicit memory traces of specific visual contexts experienced in the past (contextual cueing). Compared to the visual memory tapped by change blindness tasks, the implicit memory mechanisms of priming of <b>popout</b> and contextual cueing do not require conscious intervention and may exhibit greater memory capacity, longer durability, and higher discriminability. Thus, these implicit traces of past views guide attention and eye movements to allow for effective access (indexing) to a scene’s details, hence providing context and continuity to ongoing interactions with the perceptual world.

40|$|AbstractWe studied how {{attention}} affects contrast {{detection performance}} when {{the target is}} surrounded by mask elements. In each display quadrant we presented a hexagon of six vertical Gabor patches (the ‘surround’). Only one of the hexagons contained a central Gabor patch (the ‘target’) and the task was to report that quadrant (spatial four-alternative-forced choice). Attention was manipulated {{by means of a}} double-task paradigm: in one condition observers had to perform concurrently a central letter-discrimination task, and the contrast-detection task was then only poorly attended, while attention was fully available in the other condition. We find that under poorly attended conditions targets can be detected only when the target contrast exceeds the surround contrast (contrast <b>popout)</b> or when the target orientation differs from the surround orientation by more than 10 – 15 ° (orientation <b>popout).</b> When the target orientation is similar to the surround orientation, attention can reduce the contrast detection thresholds in some cases more than four-fold, demonstrating a very strong attentional effect...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{target that}} differs in {{orientation}} from neighboring lines and “pops out” {{has been found}} to evoke larger responses in cortical V 1 cells than lines in the uniform texture surround which do not <b>popout</b> (e. g., Journal of Neurophysiology 67 (1992) 961). If this is more than a coincidence of observations, physiological properties of contextual modulation should be reflected in the perception of salience. In particular, as the differential suppression from texture surround has been reported to be delayed, target salience may be affected by the history of surrounding lines, i. e. by their orientation before the target was presented. This was tested using a feature flicker paradigm in which target and background lines changed their orientations (Experiment 2). All subjects (N= 4) indicated a benefit in target detection when target orientation was not previously present in the surround. A control experiment showed that this effect was not caused by the purely temporal aspects of asynchronous stimulus presentation (Experiment 3). To distinguish this effect from other sources of delayed processing, Experiment 1 compared the performance in target detection and target identification tasks, for single-lines and <b>popout</b> targets. All subjects required longer stimulus presentation time to identify the orientation of a single line than to detect the line itself, indicating that orientation coding needs longer processing than encoding stimulus onset. However, most subjects needed even longer presentations to detect <b>popout,</b> suggesting that the processing of orientation contrast adds to this delay. In an appendix, putative response variations of V 1 cells to asynchronous flicker are computed...|$|E
40|$|Does {{theory of}} mind play a {{significant}} role in where people choose to hide an item or where they search for an item that has been hidden? Adapting the "Hide-Find Paradigm" of Anderson et al. (2014), participants viewed homogenous or <b>popout</b> visual arrays on a touchscreen table. Their task was to indicate where in the array they would hide an item, or to search for an item that had been hidden, by either a friend or a foe. Critically, participants believed that their sitting location at the touchtable was the same as - or opposite to - their partner's location. Replicating Anderson et al. participants tended to (1) select items nearer to themselves on homogenous displays, and this bias was stronger for a friend than foe; and (2) select <b>popout</b> items, and again, more for a friend than foe. These biases were observed only when participants believed that they shared the same physical perspective as their partner. Collectively the data indicate that theory of mind plays a significant role in hiding and finding, and demonstrate that the hide-find paradigm is a powerful tool for investigating theory of mind in adults...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSingle cell {{recordings}} in area V 1 of the macaque monkey {{had suggested}} that saliency effects from orientation contrast might be delayed compared to the representation of other stimulus properties. This conjecture was tested in three series of experiments on regular line patterns. Experiment 1 investigated the time courses of saliency effects evoked either by the onset of a single line or by a target that popped out from orientation contrast. Saliency effects from orientation contrast developed later than saliency effects related to stimulus onset. Experiment 2 measured the detectability of such targets in brief presentations. As expected, single line targets were detected at shorter presentation times than <b>popout</b> targets with orientation contrast. Experiment 3 finally investigated the temporal resolution of saliency effects from feature contrast in different dimensions. Line arrays with a <b>popout</b> target (e. g. an orthogonal line) were alternated with complementary line arrays in which the target and the non-target features were exchanged (e. g. all lines were orthogonal {{to those in the}} previous pattern). Thus, although feature contrast was present in every single stimulus display, saliency effects could only develop when alternation rates were slow enough to be resolved by the underlying saliency mechanisms. Feature flicker of this sort was tested in orientation, motion (direction), color and luminance. Saliency mechanisms encoding orientation contrast were slower than those encoding differences in luminance or color; motion contrast produced intermediate results that also differed between subjects...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the link between}} neuronal activity in the frontal eye field (FEF) and the enhancement of visual processing associated with covert spatial attention {{in the absence of}} eye movements. We correlated activity recorded in the FEF of monkeys manually reporting the identity of a visual search target to performance accuracy and reaction time. Monkeys were cued to the most probable target location with a cue array containing a <b>popout</b> color singleton. Neurons exhibited spatially selective responses for the <b>popout</b> cue stimulus and for the target of the search array. The magnitude of activity related to the location of the cue prior to the presentation of the search array was correlated with trends in behavioral performance across valid, invalid, and neutral cue trial conditions. However, the speed and accuracy of the behavioral report on individual trials were predicted by the magnitude of spatial selectivity related to the target to be identified, not for the spatial cue. A minimum level of selectivity was necessary for target detection and a higher level for target identification. Muscimol inactivation of FEF produced spatially selective perceptual deficits in the covert search task that were correlated with the effectiveness of the inactivation and were strongest on invalid cue trials that require an endogenous attention shift. These results demonstrate a strong functional link between FEF activity and covert spatial attention and suggest that spatial signals from FEF directly influence visual processing during the time that a stimulus to be identified is being processed by the visual system...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fascinating}} phenomena in stereopsis is the profound hysteresis effect reported by Fender and Julesz (1967), in which the depth percept persisted with increasing disparity long past the point at which depth was recovered with decreasing disparity. To control retinal disparity without vergence eye movements, they stabilized the stimuli on the retinas with an eye tracker. I now report that stereo hysteresis can be observed directly in printed stereograms simply by rotating the image. As the stereo image rotates, the horizontal disparities rotate to become vertical, then horizontal with inverted sign, and then vertical again before returning to the original orientation. The depth shows an interesting <b>popout</b> effect, almost as though the depth was turning on and off rapidly, despite the inherently sinusoidal change in the horizontal disparity vector. This stimulus was generated electronically in a circular format so that the random-dot field could be dynamically replaced, eliminating any cue to cyclorotation. Noise density was scaled with eccentricity to fade out the stimulus near fixation. For both the invariant and the dynamic noise, profound hysteresis of several seconds delay was found in six observers. This was far longer than the reaction time to respond to changes in disparity, which was less than a second. Purely horizontal modulation of disparity to match the horizontal vector component of the disparity rotation did not show the <b>popout</b> effect, which thus seems to be a function of the interaction between horizontal and vertical disparities and may be attributable to depth interpolation processes...|$|E

Training was specific to the targetdistractor stimuli and did not transfer to other configurations.

40|$|AbstractReaction {{time in a}} {{detection}} or {{a location}} discrimination task was longer when a target appeared at the same location {{as in the previous}} trial (inhibition of return; IOR). However, it became shorter when the task was color or orientation discrimination (facilitation of return: FOR).

In additional experiments, vernier, size, and luminance discriminations all led to FOR, whereas eye-movement and arm-reaching tasks led to IOR. Moreover, identical stimuli could lead to the opposite patterns of result depending on the nature of the task: inhibition in global location tasks, and facilitation in feature analysis tasks. These may correspond to “where” vs “what” or “action” vs “recognition” pathways neurophysiologically. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Visual pop-out {{occurs when}} a unique visual target (e. g., a feature singleton) is present {{in a set of}} {{homogeneous}} distractors. However, the role of visual awareness in this process remains unclear. In the experiments reported here, we showed that even though subjects were not aware of a suppressed pop-out display, their subsequent performance on an orientationdiscrimination task was significantly better at the pop-out location than at a control location. These results indicate that conscious visual awareness of a feature singleton is not necessary for it to attract attention. Furthermore, the subliminal <b>popout</b> effect disappeared when subjects diverted their attention toward a rapid sequential visual presentation task while presented with the same subliminal pop-out display. These results suggest that top-down attention is necessary for the subliminal pop-out effect and that the cognitive processes underlying attention and awareness are somewhat independent...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a brief {{outline of the}} approaches to modeling human visual attention. Bottom-up and top-down mechanisms are described together {{with some of the}} problems that they face. It has been suggested in brain science that memory functions by trading measurement precision for associative power; sensory inputs from the environment are never identical on separate occasions, but the associations with memory compensate for the differences. A graphical representation for image similarity is described that relies on the size of maximally associative structures (cliques) that are found to reflect between pairs of images. This is applied to the recognition of movie posters, the location and recognition of characters, and the recognition of faces. The similarity mechanism is shown to model <b>popout</b> effects when constraints are placed on the physical separation of pixels that correspond to nodes in the maximal cliques. The effect extends to modeling human visual behaviour on the Poggendorff illusion...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{search is}} the task of finding a target in an image against a {{background}} of distractors. Unique features of targets enable them to pop out against the background, while targets defined by lacks of features or conjunctions of features are more difficult to spot. It is known that the ease of target detection can change when the roles of figure and ground are switched. The mechanisms underlying the ease of pop out and asymmetry in visual search have been elusive. This paper shows that a model of segmentation in V 1 based on intracortical interactions can explain many of the qualitative aspects of visual search. 1 Introduction Visual search is closely related to visual segmentation, and therefore can be used to diagnose the mechanisms of visual segmentation. For instance, a red dot can <b>popout</b> {{against a background of}} green distractor dots instantaneously, suggesting that only pre-attentive mechanisms are necessary (Treisman et al, 1990). On the other hand, it is much more difficult to [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The goal of pre-attentive {{segmentation}} is to mark conspicuous image locations such as region boundaries, smooth contours and <b>popout</b> targets against backgrounds. This salience detection {{relies on}} not only feature similarity analysis but also local feature contrast. We identify these two measures with attraction and nondirectional repulsion, and unify the dual processes of association by attraction and segregation by repulsion in one grouping framework. We generalize normalized cuts to multi-way partitioning with these dual measures {{and show that}} the criterion {{can be viewed as}} a stochastic jump-diffusion process, where the probability of jump is determined by the relative strengths of attraction and repulsion. We demonstrate that this extended model can deal with salience detection under various situations as well as the asymmetry in visual search. Through these results, we provide a clear understanding of the role of negative weights in the graph partitioning framework. This opens up the possibilities of encoding negative correlations in constraint satisfaction problems, where solutions by simple and robust eigendecomposition become possible. 1...|$|E
