5|$|In 1906, {{after making}} 24 {{memorial}} tablets for the project, William De Morgan abandoned the ceramics business {{to become a}} novelist, and the only ceramics firm able to manufacture appropriate further tiles was Royal Doulton. Dissatisfied with Royal Doulton's designs, and preoccupied with {{the management of the}} Watts Gallery and Watts Mortuary Chapel in Compton, Surrey, Mary Watts lost interest in the <b>project.</b> <b>Work</b> to complete it was sporadic and ceased altogether in 1931 with only 53 of the planned 120 tiles in place. In 2009, the Diocese of London consented to further additions to the memorial, and the first new tablet in 78 years was added.|$|E

Shortly before the war ended, he took over the management of the Clinton Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Monsanto pulled out of Oak Ridge in December 1947, but became the operator of the Mound Laboratories in 1948. Secretary of State Dean Acheson appointed Thomas to serve on a 1946 panel to appraise international atomic inspection, which culminated in the Acheson–Lilienthal Report. In 1953 he was appointed as a consultant to the National Security Council, and served as U.S. Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E

25|$|The largest canal {{appears to}} be the Ancient Suez Canal {{connecting}} the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea via the Nile. Opened by king Ptolemy II around 280BC the waterway branched off the Pelusiac arm of the river running eastwards through the Wadi Tumalat to the Bitter Lakes on a length of 55.6km. There, it turned sharply south following the modern course of the canal and discharged into the Red Sea after altogether 92.6km. The canal was 10m deep and 35m wide, with its sea entrance secured by a lock. Under Trajan the Ptolemaic canal was restored and extended for about another 60km to the south where it now tapped the main branch of the Nile at Babylon. A particularly ambitious canal scheme which never came to fruition was Nero's Corinth Canal <b>project,</b> <b>work</b> on which was abandoned after his murder.|$|E
25|$|From about 1879 Bell's {{earliest}} physics {{research in}} Washington. D.C. {{was conducted at}} his first laboratory, a rented house, at 1325 L Street NW, and then from the autumn of 1880 at 1221 Connecticut Avenue NW. The laboratory was later relocated to 2020 F Street NW sometime after January 1886. With most of the laboratory's <b>project</b> <b>work</b> being conducted by his two associates, Bell was able to engage in extensive research into the causes of deafness as well as ways of improving {{the lives of the}} deaf, leading him to create the Volta Bureau in 1887. In 1889, Bell and his family moved from their Brodhead-Bell mansion to a new home close to his father, Alexander Melville Bell. Between 1889 and 1893, the Volta Bureau was located in the carriage house {{to the rear of the}} home of Bell's father, at 1527 35th Street NW in Washington, D.C. The work of the Bureau increased to such an extent that in 1893 Bell, with the assistance of his father, constructed a neoclassical yellow brick and sandstone building specifically to house the institution.|$|E
