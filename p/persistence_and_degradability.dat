Greenness of ILs depends not only on themselves but also on their synthesis and specific applications. For a chemical process where the IL is employed, its greenness should be assessed using the life cycle analysis method and compared with other alternative processes.

The in vitro experiment was carried out following {{the first stage of}} Tilley and Terry method. The treatments consisting of four levels of sulfur, were A = ammoniated Rice Straw (RS) (control), B = A + 0. 15 % Sulfur (S) supplement, C = A + 0. 3 % Sulfur supplement and D = A + 0. 45 % sulfur supplement on dry matter. Completely randomized design was used as the experimental design and differences among treatment means were examined using Duncan multiple range test. Variables measured were Ammonia (NH 3) and Volatile Fatty Acid (VFA) concentrations, as fermentability indicators, as well as degradability indicators including degradability of Dry Matter (DM), Organic Matter (OM), Neutral Detergent Fibre (NDF), Acid Detergent Fibre (ADF) and cellulose. The results indicated that fermentability <b>and</b> <b>degradability</b> of diets consisting ammoniated RS with Sulfur supplementation were significantly higher than the control diet (p< 0. 05). It is concluded that sulfur supplementation is important to improve fermentability <b>and</b> <b>degradability</b> of rations containing ammoniated RS.

Then, collagen-modified PLA (collagen-PLA) was prepared by the reaction between the reactive acylchlorided group and amino/hydroxyl groups on collagen. Subsequently, the structure of collagen-PLA was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and DSC analyses. Finally, some properties of collagen-PLA, such as hydrophilicity, cell compatibility <b>and</b> <b>degradability</b> were characterized. Results showed that collagen had been grafted onto the PLA with 5 % graft ratio.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{strategy}} is proposed to predict physical properties, partitioning, bioconcentration <b>and</b> <b>degradability</b> of nonionized, nonpolymeric organic chemicals. The strategy uses structural features of organic chemicals, structure activity relationships, sequenced estimation techniques (including recently developed computerized methods), and laboratory screening tests. The cost {{to use this}} {{strategy is}} compared {{with the cost of}} conducting a standard menu of tests to measure physical properties, partitioning, bioconcentration <b>and</b> <b>degradability.</b> This chapter proposes a strategy for using structural features of organic chemicals, structure activity relationships, sequenced estimation techniques (including some recently developed computerized methods) and laboratory screening tests to predict the chemical fate of nonionized, nonpolymeric organic chemicals (figure 13 - 1).

40|$|Although {{forsterite}} (Mg 2 SiO 4) possesses good biocompatibility {{and suitable}} mechanical properties, the insufficient bioactivity <b>and</b> <b>degradability</b> hinders its further application. In this study, a novel MgO-CaO-SiO 2 system {{was developed by}} adding wollastonite (CaSiO 3) into Mg 2 SiO 4 to fabricate bone scaffolds via selective laser sintering (SLS). The apatite-forming ability <b>and</b> <b>degradability</b> of the scaffolds were enhanced because the degradation of CaSiO 3 could form silanol groups, which could offer nucleation sites for apatite. Meanwhile, the mechanical properties of the scaffolds grew with increasing CaSiO 3 to 20 wt %. It was explained that the liquid phase of CaSiO 3 promoted the densification during sintering due to its low melting point. With the further increase in CaSiO 3, the mechanical properties decreased due {{to the formation of}} the continuous filling phase. Furthermore, the scaffolds possessed a well-interconnected porous structure and exhibited an ability to support cell adhesion and proliferation...|$|R

We use a single data set comprising oxygen, nitrate, ammonium and organic carbon versus depth profiles from a slope station in the Goban Spur area (1034 m, Northeast Atlantic). Based on an extensive sensitivity analysis, it appears that (1) when using all data, the total mineralization rates can be determined with reasonable precision; bioturbation <b>and</b> <b>degradability</b> are less well constrained and (2) total mineralization rates can be determined based on nitrate and oxygen profiles only; estimates of organic matter mixing rates <b>and</b> <b>degradability</b> are refined when including the solid phase organic carbon profile. The bulk mixing rates obtained for organic carbon are one order of magnitude higher than mixing rates previously estimated from 210 Pb profiles, lending validity to the hypothesis that organic particles are mixed faster than inert particles.

The fermentation kinetics of eight feeds commonly used in ruminant nutrition (alfalfa hay, barley meal, beet pulp, corn meal and silage, ryegrass hay and silage and soya bean meal s. e.) were studied with the in vitro gas production technique and rumen fermentation parameters (substrate disappearance, pH and volatile fatty acids production) were determined after 120 h of incubation. The linear relationship indicates that the microbial metabolic pathways of the two inocula for all the substrates were qualitatively similar, albeit often quantitatively different. In this in vitro study, a significant influence of rumen inoculum (buffalo vs. cow) on fermentation <b>and</b> <b>degradability</b> of the examined substrates was found. The differences in buffalo and cattle rumen fermentation can be explained with a different microbial activity of the two ruminant species, because of different amount of microbial population or microbial population constituted by different species of bacteria and protozoa...|$|R

40|$|Dissertation {{in defense}} of Ph. D in OLITThere {{is a need for}} a better {{understanding}} of persistence in online environments from a positive perspective. The appreciative inquiry (AI) model challenges the traditional problem based paradigm with an “affirmative” approach to embrace challenges in a positive light. This study uses an appreciative inquiry approach to grounded theory analysis to study online learning <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> success. The purpose of this qualitative grounded theory study was: 1) to discover the themes and factors that emerge from an appreciative inquiry of online learner persistence; 2) to identify the meaning of persistence for online students; 3) to create provocative propositions of the construct of learning <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> success in online courses, and 4) to generate a theory of learning <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> success in online courses. Through face-to-face and online interviews, thirty students in five online courses at Central New Mexico Community College participated in the study which led to identifying three categories, eight themes <b>and</b> thirty-six learning <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> success factors. A new understanding of persistence as a multigenerational and life situational phenomenon arose from the data. Five propositions are presented. They are the following: 1. 	Online learning persistence commences when the motivations, values and expectations encounter access to online courses. 2. 	The opportunity for higher engaged learning in online classes is created when students’ best practices of organization, interaction and responsibility intersect with faculty’s best practices of timely interactions and flexible course structure. 3. 	Learning <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> success increases for all students when the online course design includes multigenerational and situational perspectives. 4. 	Continuous learning <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> success in online courses is transformational. 5. 	Appreciative inquiry interviews could positively affect student grades <b>and</b> <b>persistence</b> in the online class. An Appreciative Paradigm of Online Learning <b>Persistence</b> <b>and</b> Success Model was created to provide a comprehensive picture of the categories, themes and factors that support learning <b>persistence</b> <b>and</b> success. The study offers a comprehensive powerful model which designers, instructors and students can use for higher engagement and transformational learning in online courses.
