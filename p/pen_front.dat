5000|$|For {{the first}} time, two major {{candidates}} from {{the presidential election}} stood in the same constituency for the legislative election. Jean-Luc Mélenchon (Left Front) and Marine Le <b>Pen</b> (National <b>Front)</b> are both standing in the Pas-de-Calais's 11th constituency, centred on the town of Hénin-Beaumont. The incumbent MP, Odette Duriez of the Socialist Party, is not standing for re-election; the Socialist candidate is Philippe Kemel. The Le Pen-Mélenchon duel attracted international media attention, including for what it revealed of attitudes and expectations {{in an area of}} northern France hit hard by deindustrialisation and unemployment. The Guardian noted that, in that regard, [...] "Mélenchon blames what he sees as pernicious free-market capitalism and bankers; Le Pen points the finger at immigrants and Europe".|$|R
2500|$|Strauss cites Jörg Haider of Austria's far-right Freedom Party and Jean-Marie Le <b>Pen</b> of France's <b>Front</b> {{national}} {{as examples}} of the far right exploiting their electorate's concerns about globalization.

5000|$|Bettencourt’s {{position}} was also greatly bolstered by New Hampshire Union Leader Publisher Joe McQuaid who <b>penned</b> a <b>front</b> editorial supportive of Bettencourt. New Hampshire’s only state-wide newspaper wrote, “This newspaper {{called for the}} resignation of Bishop John McCormack nine years ago, {{when it became clear}} just how shabby a record he had in handling pedophile priests for the equally shabby Cardinal Bernard Law in Boston…House Majority Leader D.J. Bettencourt would not need to apologize, as he rightly did yesterday, had he been more subtle in his remarks questioning McCormack's moral authority to criticize the Legislature last week. Tough choices to contend with New Hampshire's soaring budget ills may hurt innocent victims. But Bishop McCormack is in no position to talk, or to be listened to, on the subject of innocent victims.” ...|$|R
50|$|In September 1989, {{he was a}} {{candidate}} for the senatorial elections and won the district. In 1992, the renewal of the regional council of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur enlisted much media interest. He then had to face the growing power of Jean-Marie Le <b>Pen</b> and the <b>Front</b> National. At the end of a harsh and difficult campaign, he carried the vote again, beating Bernard Tapie and Jean-Marie Le Pen. He was also re-elected president of the regional council on 27 March 1992.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{his defeat}} Rauti's {{position}} within the party was soon strengthened. Fini looked {{to the success of}} Jean-Marie Le <b>Pen</b> and the <b>Front</b> National in France and, seeking to utilise the template they had established, sought to make opposition to immigration the central policy of the MSI. The move provoked alarm as it seemed that Fini was seeking to abandon fascism altogether and instead turn the MSI to populism. This radical departure, combined with some poor electoral showings, led to Rauti replacing Fini as leader in 1990.|$|R

50|$|In {{recent years}} {{shearing}} sheds have usually included improved penning systems {{to assist with}} the movement of sheep and ideally will include swing/slide gates to facilitate their closure. A single sheep is sometimes penned in a small <b>pen</b> at the <b>front</b> of the forcing lane to coax the other sheep forward. The slats in a catching pen run in the direction that the sheep are to be dragged. Modern sheds often include a catching pen floor that slopes towards the board to help shearers move their sheep towards their “stand”.|$|R
40|$|Marine Le <b>Pen,</b> of the <b>Front</b> National, and Geert Wilders, of the Netherlands’ Party for Freedom, have {{announced}} {{their intention to}} form an alliance with several parties across Europe after the European Parliament elections. But how should such an alliance be structured? Zoe Lefkofridi presents {{an analysis of the}} coherence of potential members of a new nationalist bloc on three different issues: European integration, immigration, and left/right issues. She finds that the greatest level of coherence is shown between these parties on left/right issues. Framing the alliance around this dimension would therefore make for a more effective force in the Parliament...|$|R
5000|$|In {{elections}} between {{only two}} candidates where one is mildly unpopular {{and the other}} immensely unpopular, opponents of both candidates frequently advocate a vote for the mildly unpopular candidate. For example, {{in the second round}} of the 2002 French presidential election, graffiti in Paris told people to [...] "vote for the crook, not the fascist". The [...] "crook" [...] in those scribbled public messages was Jacques Chirac of Rally for the Republic, and the [...] "fascist" [...] was Jean-Marie Le <b>Pen</b> of the <b>Front</b> National. Jacques Chirac eventually won the second round having garnered 82% of the vote.|$|R
