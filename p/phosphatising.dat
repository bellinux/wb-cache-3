40|$|In {{every part}} of our life and in every {{division}} of the industry, the corrosion is one of vital problems. It becomes a subject for research and progress in the automotive sector. Based on {{the knowledge that the}} lifetime is the most important insurance that is given to the customers by the firms in a though competition, the prevention of corrosion occurs depending on the environmental protection factors and the utilization of new technology. Necessary importance should be given to the human health and the production of vehicle according to the climate changes. On this study, primarily the types of corrosion in the automotive industry has been investigated and then the data of corrosion process and the protection concepts of corrosion have been given. Mostly the dynamic corrosion program and tests that have been applied to the test vehicle took place. And then the process of surface cathodic deep dying and the development of establishment have been mentioned. Lastly, the systems for the prevention of the corrosion with the environmental protection factor determined. The usage of test vehicle met with all the corrosion problems that normally do not happen, the region of corrosion can be easily determined and all the preventive precautions can be taken before corrosion occurs. Nowadays the advanced isolation techniques such as the <b>phosphatising,</b> the surface process, the cathodic deep dying, the coating of surface and the other protection concepts that realize the techniques to continue by the constructive application, the successful results on the surfaces of the vehicles have been taken...|$|E
40|$|In an {{experimental}} bone induction model in guinea-pigs, {{large amounts of}} heterotopic osteiod and bone were found after 21 days. A semiquantiative intrasectional analysis of oxidative and hydrolytic enzyme activities in the reaction zones showed that matrix-producing cells as well as dentine-resorbing cells had acid <b>phosphatise</b> activity. Leucine aminopeptidase activity was lower in dentinoclasts and macrophages than in matrix-producing cells, which may indicate a function of this enzyme {{in the production of}} bone matrix. A substrate-specific ATPase, as well as non-specific alkaline <b>phosphatise</b> and acid <b>phosphatise</b> were active in matrix-producing cells.

40|$|A {{succession}} of Oligo-Miocene sediments at Sliema, Qawra and Migra Ferha includes a 1 O- 20 cm phosphorite conglomerate bed capping the terminal hardground of the Lower Coralline Limestone Formation (Oligocene) {{which consists of}} carbonate platform sediments. The conglomerate bed always occurs in areas of significant thinning of the overlying Lower Globigerina Limestone. These palaeohighs {{have been linked to}} NNE-SSW trending lineaments. At Sliema, allochthonous <b>phosphatised</b> conglomerate infill NW-SE trending Neptunian dykes that dissect the platform sediments. These Oligo-Miocene syntectonic deposits were later cemented and vertically displaced by minor faulting trending NW-SE. Tectonic features at Sliema are linked to the regional N-S extensional regime and tentatively interpreted to have developed from stresses caused by displacement along the western margin of a NNE-SSW trending strike-slip fault. East of this fault, synclinal subsidence created the Valletta Basin and set conditions for current upwelling. Phosphatogenesis occurred along the basin margin swept by the prevailing westward currents. <b>Phosphatised</b> pebbles and ahermatypic corals were transported westward of palaeohigh margins in central and western Malta and deposited on the terminal hardground of the drowned Oligocene carbonate platform. non peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{first record}} of a chileate (Rhynchonelliformea, Chileata, Chileida) brachiopod, Chile? sp. in South Australia is {{described}} based on a well preserved, <b>phosphatised</b> ventral valve from the early Cambrian (lower-mid Botoman; Pararaia tatei trilobite Zone) Parara Limestone exposed in Horse Gully, Yorke Peninsula. The ventral valve of Chile? sp. is the only known {{record of a}} <b>phosphatised</b> chileate and provides the first critical insight into the ontogeny of the poorly understood Cambrian Chileata. The early ontogeny of Chile? sp. closely parallels that of the aberrant early Cambrian paterinate-like phosphatic-shelled Salanygolina from Mongolia. In both Salanygolina and Chile? sp., the anterior margin of the well defined ventral larval shell is indented by an unrestricted notch that, through later ontogeny, develops into a foramen, directly anterior to the umbo. In subsequent ontogenetic development, this subtriangular foramen is enlarged by resorption and covered posteriorly by the colleplax- a triangular plate- in the umbonal foramen.

40|$|Secondarily <b>phosphatised</b> olenid trilobites from organic−rich limestones (orsten) in the Furongian (Upper Cambrian) of Västergötland, south−central Sweden, are {{described}} and illustrated. All trilobites originate from the Peltura scara− baeoides Zone and {{were collected on}} the western slope of Kinnekulle. Only the dorsal exoskeletons have become second− arily <b>phosphatised,</b> and the ventral appendages are not preserved. Yet the material is otherwise remarkably well preserved and reveals the morphology of the olenid trilobites in greater detail than hitherto known. Species belonging to the genera Ctenopyge, Sphaerophthalmus, Parabolina, and Peltura are identified, and several juvenile specimens {{are present in the}} material. The material is disarticulated and fragmentary, and it has only been possible to identify a few specimens to spe− cies level. In addition to chaetognaths and conodonts, the trilobites are associated with pelmatozoan columnals, a possible camaroid, and fossils of uncertain affinities. These fossils, along with a probable conulariid fragment from the Peltura minor Zone, are also described and discussed. The presence of a benthic fauna of pelmatozoans, and possible conulariids and camaroids, indicates that at least parts of the Peltura zones were deposited during dysoxic rather than anoxic periods...|$|R

40|$|<b>Phosphatised</b> fossil assemblages of four {{samples from}} the Lower Globigerina Limestone Formation at Wardija (SE Gozo, Malta) were analysed, with special {{emphasis}} on holoplanktonic molluscs (Gastropoda: Heteropoda and Pteropoda). The upper sample (sample 4) is from the lower main phosphorite level (C 1), samples 1 to 3 are respectively from c. 3 m, 5 m and 7. 50 m above {{the base of the}} Lower Globigerina Limestone. <b>Phosphatised</b> faunal elements were separated from the limestone sediment by formic acid treatment. The fossil assemblages yielded a surprising number of species new for the Maltese Archipelago, or even new to science. Comparison with other holoplanktonic mollusc assemblages, especially those from the Aquitaine Basin in France demonstrates that there is a certain resemblance with the Chattian fauna of e. g. st. Etienne-d'Orthe (Spoelia torquayensis, Vaginella? tricuspidata), but the presence of some other species, such as Gamopleura melitensis and Vaginella sannicola indicate that the age of the Lower Globigerina Limestone presumably is Early Aquitanian. Samples 2 - 3 yielded also a comparatively rich assemblage of benthic molluscs (especially small-sized gastropods), most of which are illustrated here (PIs 1 - 3). The holoplanktonic molluscs are illustrated on PIs 3 - 4.

DE GROSSOUVRE in 1908) and the Natuurhistorisch Museum, Maastricht, revealed the following sequence of faunas. The youngest Campanian ammonite from the Vaals Formation is a specimen of Hopliloplacenticeras marroti (COQUAND, 1859) from Vijlen, Cotessen (Zuid-Limburg, The Netherlands); this is a typical lower Upper Campanian species. The Zeven Wegen Chalk yields Baculites at several localities and upper Upper Campanian Hopliloplacenticeras coesfeldiense (SCHLUETER, 1867) and Trachyscaphites spiniger (SCHLUETER, 1872) at Vijlenerbosch (Zuid-Limburg, The Netherlands) : these are Bostrychoceras polyplocum Zone species. An unspecified horizon within the Gulpen Formation of Schneeberg, north of Vaals yields the lower Lower Maastrichtian Acanthoscaphites tridens (KNER, 1848); the same species occurs at Vaals. No ammonites were seen from the Beutenaken Chalk, but the Vijlen Chalk yields <b>phosphatised</b> and unphosphatised Baculites {{at a number of}} localities, Hoploscaphites tenuistriatus (KNER, 1848) at Mesch (Zuid-Limburg, The Netherlands), and there is a record of Pachydiscus sp. from Hallembaye, Liège. No ammonites were seen from the Lixhe or Lanaye Chalks. The base of the Valkenburg Chalk yields <b>phosphatised</b> Baculites anceps LAMARCK, 1822, and <b>phosphatised</b> Baculites sp. at the Blankenberg Quarry, Cadier en Keer (Zuid-Limburg, The Netherlands). No ammonites were seen from the Gronsveld, Schiepersberg or Emael Chalks. Ammonites known to be from the Nekum Chalk, mostly from the environs of Maastricht, are Anapachydiscus fresvillensis (SEUNES, 1890). Diplomoceras cylindraceum (DEFRANCE, 1816), Baculites vertebralis LAMARCK, 1801, B. anceps LAMARCK, 1822 and Hoploscaphites constrictus (J. SOWERBY. 1817). There are two records of Sphenodiscus binkhorsti BOEHM, 1898 from this unit. Ammonites known to be from the Meerssen Chalk are Nostoceras sp., Diplomoceras cylindraceum (DEFRANCE, 1816), Baculites vertebralis LAMARCK, 1801, B. anceps LAMARCK, 1822 and Hoploscaphites constrictus (J. SOWERBY, 1817). The upper part of the Meerssen Chalk only yields frequent Sphenodiscus binkhorsti BOEHM, 1898 and the crassus form of Hoploscaphites constrictus. A single specimen of Eubaculites lyelli (d'ORBIGNY, 1847) from Maastricht is from either the Nekum of the Meerssen Chalk. Ammonites from {{the upper part of the}} "Calcaire de Kunraed" are Saghalinites sp., Pachydiscus (Pachydiscus) gollevillensis (d'ORBIGNY, 1850), P.

SOWERBY, 1817), H. felderi sp. nov., H. pungens (BINKHORST, 1861). Acanthoscaphites verneuilianus (d'ORBIGNY, 1841) and Acanthoscaphites sp. These ammonites records are in accord with recent work on the belemnites of the region (SCHULZ and SCHMID, 1983) that has shown the Zeven Wegen to Beutenaken Chalk to be Lower Maastrichtian, the Vijlen to lower Meerssen Chalk to be Upper Maastrichtian, Belemnitella junior Zone and only the upper part of the Meerssen Chalk to be Upper Maastrichtian, Belemnella casimirovensis Zone. The upper part of the "Calcaire de Kunraed" yields Upper Maastrichtian ammonites that show it to be older than the upper part of the Meerssen Chalk, compatible with microfaunal work by VILLAIN (1977) and the presence of belemnites of the Belemnitella junior Zone but not of the Belemnella casimirovensis Zone. Also included in this work is a {{revision of}} the classic Maastrichtian ammonite Pachydiscus colligatus BINKHORST, 1861.

Three hundred and seventy five fish (108 ± 0. 63 g) {{were divided into}} five feeding groups. The control group (C) was fed to satiation {{three times a day}} during the experiment. The four groups were starved for 1 (W 1), 2 (W 2), 3 (W 3), and 4 (W 4) weeks respectively, and then fed to satiation during a 4 week re-feeding period. The results indicated that some parameters including final weight, specific growth rate,body weight increase, plasma enzymes (ALT, Alanine aminotransferase, AST, Aspartat aminotransferase and ALP, Alkaline <b>phosphatise,</b> hematological parameters [Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) ]were significantly affected by feeding regimes. The plasma cortisol, hematocrit, lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes were not affected by starvation and subsequent re-feeding. These findings showed that short term starvations had no significant negative effects on growth performance, most biochemical and hematological parameters in Persian sturgeon could recover when re-feeding resumed...|$|R
40|$|The Cambrian 'Orsten' fauna {{comprises}} exceptionally {{preserved and}} <b>phosphatised</b> microscopic arthropods. The external morphology of these fossils is well known, but their internal soft-tissue anatomy has remained virtually unknown. Here, we report the first non-biomineralised tissues from a juvenile polymerid trilobite, represented by digestive structures, glands, and connective strands harboured in a hypostome from the Swedish 'Orsten' fauna. Synchrotron-radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy enabled three-dimensional internal recordings at sub-micrometre resolution. The specimen provides the first unambiguous {{evidence for a}} J-shaped anterior gut {{and the presence of}} a crop with a constricted alimentary tract in the Trilobita. Moreover, the gut is Y-shaped in cross section, probably due to a collapsed lumen of that shape, another feature which has not previously been observed in trilobites. The combination of anatomical features suggests that the trilobite hypostome is functionally analogous to the labrum of euarthropods and that it was a sophisticated element closely integrated with the digestive system. This study also briefly addresses the preservational bias of the 'Orsten' fauna, particularly the near-absence of polymerid trilobites, and the taphonomy of the soft-tissue-harbouring hypostome...|$|R
40|$|Rho-GTPases have {{relevant}} {{functions in}} {{various aspects of}} neuronal development, such as differentiation, migration, and synaptogenesis. Loss of function of the oligophrenin- 1 gene (OPHN 1) causes X-linked intellectual disability with cerebellar hypoplasia and leads to hyperactivation of the rho kinase (ROCK) pathway. ROCK mainly acts through phosphorylation of the myosin <b>phosphatise</b> targeting subunit 1, triggering actin-myosin contractility. We show that during in vitro neurogenesis, ROCK activity decreases from day 10 until terminal differentiation, whereas in OPHN 1 -deficient human {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (h-iPSCs), the levels of ROCK are elevated throughout differentiation. ROCK inhibition favors neuronal-like appearance of h-iPSCs, in parallel with transcriptional up regulation of nuclear receptor NR 4 A 1, which is known to induce neurite outgrowth. This study analyzed the morphological, biochemical, and functional features of OPHN 1 -deficient h-iPSCs and their rescue by treatment with the ROCK inhibitor fasudil, shedding light on the relevance of the ROCK pathway during neuronal differentiation and providing a neuronal model for human OPHN 1 syndrome and its treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{suspended}} matter, heavily {{contaminated by}} mine spoils, {{that has been}} carried down from the Idrija mercury mining site (Slovenija), by the trans-boundary Soča-Isonzo river system, for centuries, has been deposited on riverside banks soils. As a consequence Hg concentrations in these soils can reach up to 80 μg g- 1. Mercury is well {{known as one of}} the most toxic elements, but there is a lack of data about its long-term effects on soil microbial biomass and soil biological activities. The aim of this work was to determine the Hg distribution and chemical speciation in soils near the Isonzo river banks, by applying the Bloom et al. (2003) five steps selective sequential extraction procedure, and measure the effects of this diffuse and long term Hg contamination on the soil biological activities in both natural and cultivated soils. The results showed that soil Hg is in large part in the form of cinnabar (HgS) (72. 9 ÷ 94. 1 %), whereas the presence of the most bioavailable forms (water soluble, acid soluble and organo-chelated) is generally low. Soil microbial biomass, estimated by the fumigation-extraction method, was not affected by Hg contamination, as were many soil enzymatic activities such as: FDA hydrolysis, β-glucosidase and alkaline <b>phosphatise.</b> Only arylsulphatase and acid <b>phosphatise</b> activities showed significant negative trends with total mercury and its fractions. Soil respiration and specific soil microbial biomass respiration (QCO 2) were in the normal range but did not display the expected increasing trend with soil organic carbon, yet neither showed any significant decrease at high levels of Hg contamination, confirming the absence of a generalized microbial stress in our soils. Methanogenesis was not affected by either long-term Hg contamination or new acute HgCl 2 additions. On the contrary, methane-oxidation rates were strongly depressed both in long-term contaminated soils and after new acute additions of HgCl 2 up to 100 μg Hg g- 1. The contrasting effects on microbial communities involved in methane synthesis and degradation may alter the overall balance of CH 4 fluxes between soil and atmosphere in Hg contaminated soils. The results of this work show that although some general soil microbial activities have not been altered by this long-term Hg contamination, other biological activities linked to specific microbial groups may be significantly depressed...|$|R
