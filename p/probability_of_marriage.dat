She comes to the following conclusions: 1) In the chronologic development increasing <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> contracting <b>marriage</b> is noted, which is caused by decreasing mortality, particularly in the younger age groups, and more favourable conditions for contracting marriage. 2) The share <b>of</b> second <b>marriages</b> in the total number <b>of</b> contracted <b>marriages</b> increases quickly because: average duration of life grows longer; number of decided divorces rises considerably; more persons are ready to contract marriage with a divorced or widowed partner. There is more <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> contracting <b>marriage</b> for widowed or divorced men than for bachelors. The same holds in the case of divorced women. 3) The fact worth noting is that the average age at contracting marriage in a country ruled by certain market mechanisms is much more advanced than in socialistic countries.

This is primarily between commoners and non-resident slaves. Also males of the elite and petty elite classes, particularly older ones, marry commoners and slaves in significant numbers. We document significant differences in the marriage patterns for craftsmen, as opposed to other commoners.

In other words, individuals who were not married were more likely to stay unmarried, and those who were married were more likely to stay married. Her explanation behind this, which is consistent with other studies, is that after reform single women were required to work more, increasing their income and reducing their incentive to give up independence for marriage, whereas for married women, post-reform there was potentially {{a significant increase in the}} amount of hours they would have to work when single, discouraging divorce.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} French family {{quotient}} reform of 1995 {{to analyze the}} impact of the individual income tax on marriage behavior. An important feature of this reform was the cancelation of fiscal subsidies aimed at cohabiting couples with children. Before 1995, the system of the family quotient granted one extra half unit to each single parent with children as defined for tax purposes. The 1995 family quotient reform cancels the benefit for cohabitants with children by introducing the notion of isolated parents with children in the tax declaration. This measure thus compensates the marriage penalty for couples with children but does not change anything for couples without children. To assess {{the impact of the}} reform, we use the difference-in-differences estimation approach. Using the panel structure of the French employment survey during the 1990 ’s we find high and heterogeneous effect of the reform on the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> In particular, the <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> has increased by about 5 points for young cohabitant couples with children, and by about 12 to 14 points when focusing on those with more than one kid or on those with less educated woman and higher educated man.

Using data from rural Bangladesh, we explore the commonly cited hypotheses that women attain less schooling as a result of marrying young. We isolate the causal effect <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> timing by exploiting variation in the timing of menarche as an instrumental variable for age <b>of</b> first <b>marriage.</b> Our results indicate that marriage age matters: Each additional year that marriage is delayed is associated with 0. 30 additional years of schooling and 6. 5 % higher <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> literacy.

We empirically explore this issue {{using data from}} the NLSY 79 and NLSY 97 and a number of {{estimation}} strategies (including OLS, IV, and sibling FE). Our IV estimates (with same-sex sibling’s BMI as an instrument and a large set of controls including wage) suggest that a one-unit increase in BMI leads to an almost 2 % increase in White married women’s hours of work. However, BMI is not associated with hours of work of married men. We also find that a one-unit increase in BMI leads to a 1.4 % increase in White single women’s hours of work, suggesting that single women may expect future in-marriage transfers that vary by body weight. We show that the positive association between BMI and hours of work of White single women increases with self-assessed <b>probability</b> <b>of</b> future <b>marriage</b> and varies with expected cumulative spousal income. Comparisons between the association between BMI and hours of work for White and Black married women suggest a possible racial gap in intra-marriage transfers from husbands to wives.|$|R

Complementary, we put forward an interpretation of female employment rates as indicators of a region’s degree of secularization, for example.
