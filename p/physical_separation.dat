5|$|The third mode is parapatric {{speciation}}. This {{is similar}} to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in {{that there is no}} <b>physical</b> <b>separation</b> between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations. Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum, which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines. Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause reinforcement, which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as character displacement, which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} close {{companion}} search around 16 known early L dwarfs using aperture masking interferometry with Palomar laser guide star adaptive optics (LGS AO). The use of aperture masking allows {{the detection of}} close binaries, corresponding to projected <b>physical</b> <b>separations</b> of 0. 6 - 10. 0 AU for the targets of our survey. This survey achieved median contrast limits of ΔK ~ 2. 3 for separations between 1. 2 λ/D- 4 λ/D and ΔK ~ 1. 4 at 2 / 3 λ/D. We present four candidate binaries detected with moderate-to-high confidence (90 %- 98 %). Two have projected <b>physical</b> <b>separations</b> less than 1. 5 AU. This may indicate that tight-separation binaries contribute more significantly to the binary fraction than currently assumed, consistent with spectroscopic and photometric overluminosity studies. Ten targets of this survey have previously been observed with the Hubble Space Telescope as part of companion searches. We use the increased resolution of aperture masking to search for close or dim companions that would be obscured by full aperture imaging, finding two candidate binaries.

Methods. I investigated in detail 30 Washington Double Stars with angular separations rho > 1000 arcsec. I discarded 23 of them as probably unbound systems based on discordant astrometry, photometry, spectral types, and radial velocities. The remaining seven systems were subject to a comprehensive data compilation and derivation (multi-wavelength photometry, heliocentric distance, multiplicity, age, mass, metallicity, membership in young kinematic group). Results. Of the seven very wide systems, six have projected <b>physical</b> <b>separations</b> larger than the hypothetical cutoff at s = 0. 1 pc; four of them have separations s > 0. 2 pc. Although there are two systems in young kinematic groups (namely HD 136654 and BD+ 32 2572 in the Hyades Supercluster, and AU Mic and AT Mic AB in the beta Pictoris moving group), there is not a clear prevalence of young systems (tau < 1 Ga) among these very wide binaries.

40|$|In {{spite of}} its {{importance}} {{for the study of}} star formation at all mass domains, the nearby young sigma Orionis cluster still lacks a comprehensive survey for multiplicity. We try to fill that observational gap by looking for wide resolved binaries with angular separations between 0. 4 and 4. 0 arcsec. We search for companions to 331 catalogued cluster stellar members and candidates in public K-band UKIDSS images outside the innermost 1 arcmin, which is affected by the glare of the bright, eponymous sigma Ori multiple system, and investigate their cluster membership with colour-magnitude diagrams and previous knowledge of youth features. Of the 18 identified pairs, ten have very low individual probabilities of chance alignment (< 1 %) and are considered here as physical pairs. Four of them are new, while the other six had been discovered previously, but never investigated homogeneously and in detail. Projected <b>physical</b> <b>separations</b> and magnitude differences of the ten probably bound pairs range from 180 to 1220 au, and from 0. 0 to 3. 4 mag in K, respectively. Besides, we identify two cluster stars with elongated point spread functions. We determine the minimum frequency of wide multiplicity in the interval of projected <b>physical</b> <b>separations</b> s = 160 - 1600 au in sigma Orionis at 3. 0 ^{+ 1. 2 }_{- 1. 1 } %.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to improve our {{knowledge}} on the multiplicity of planet-host stars at wide <b>physical</b> <b>separations.</b> We cross-matched approximately 6200 square degree area of the Southern sky imaged by the Visible Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) Hemisphere Survey (VHS) with the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2 MASS) to look for wide common proper motion companions to known planet-host stars. We complemented our astrometric search with photometric criteria. We confirmed spectroscopically the co-moving nature of seven sources out of 16 companion candidates and discarded eight, while the remaining one stays as a candidate. Among these new wide companions to planet-host stars, we discovered a T 4. 5 dwarf companion at 6. 3 arcmin (~ 9000 au) from HIP 70849, a K 7 V star which hosts a 9 Jupiter mass planet with an eccentric orbit. We also report two new stellar M dwarf companions to one G and one metal-rich K star. We infer stellar and substellar binary frequencies for our complete sample of 37 targets of 5. 4 +/- 3. 8 % and 2. 7 +/- 2. 7 % (1 sigma confidence level), respectively, for projected <b>physical</b> <b>separations</b> larger than ~ 60 - 160 au assuming the range of distances of planet-host stars (24 - 75 pc).

40|$|Aims: We {{search for}} low-mass companions of M dwarfs and {{characterize}} their multiplicity fraction {{with the purpose}} of helping in the selection of the most appropriate targets for the CARMENES exoplanet survey. Methods: We obtained high-resolution images in the I band with the lucky imaging instrument FastCam at the 1. 5 m Telescopio Carlos Sanchez for 490 mid- to late-M dwarfs. For all the detected binaries, we measured angular separations, position angles, and magnitude differences in the I band. We also calculated the masses of each individual component and estimated orbital periods, using the available magnitude and colour relations for M dwarfs and our own MJ-spectral type and mass-MI relations. To avoid biases in our sample selection, we built a volume-limited sample of M 0. 0 -M 5. 0 dwarfs that is complete up to 86 % within 14 pc. Results: From the 490 observed stars, we detected 80 companions in 76 systems, of which 30 are new discoveries. The multiplicity fraction in our observed sample is 16. 7 +- 2. 0 %. In our volume-limited sample it is 19. 5 +- 2. 3 % for angular separations of 0. 2 to 5. 0 arcsec (1. 4 - 65. 6 au), The distribution of the projected <b>physical</b> <b>separations</b> peaks at 2. 5 - 7. 5 au.
