40|$|A {{major problem}} that {{industry}} is having with ultrasonic welding {{is that the}} process is material dependant. The welding machines are usually optimised for {{a specific type of}} plastic material with a predetermined thickness. This makes it difficult for the manufacturer for example to substitute the standard plastic for a stronger type. It is a well known fact that the resonance behaviour of an ultrasonic transducer changes as the load changes. The aim of the research will be to design an ultrasonic generator to suit the varying load conditions of an ultrasonic <b>plastic</b> <b>welder</b> <b>and</b> the implementation of an optimised driving method for the specific generato...|$|R
500|$|Texas {{entered the}} yard's {{floating}} drydock at approximately 22:30 on 13 December, at high tide with only [...] to spare between her hull and the blocks {{she would sit}} on. She underwent a 14-month refit that sought to restore the ship to her 1945 condition. While under refit, yard workers sand-blasted paint from not only the hull but also the superstructure and replaced many tons of rusted metal from the hull. Inside the ship, <b>welders</b> <b>and</b> <b>fabricators</b> replaced weakened structural beams and numerous rusted-out deck plates. Topside, workers removed the concrete from the main deck and made repairs. (A new pinewood deck would be installed in Green's Bayou.) In total, more than [...] of steel (amounting to about 15% of the ship's hull) was replaced and more than 40,000 rivets were seal-welded on the underwater hull.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009 This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} development of a multicell inverter for ultrasonic plastic welding applications and other ultrasonic applications. An overview of the main multilevel topologies is given, but this research focuses on the multicelll inverter, because of its capacitor voltage balancing properties. Loading effects of various plastic materials to an ultrasonic plastic welding tool are provided in this thesis. A simple method to create an approximate electrical equivalent circuit of the ultrasonic welding tool, using an impedance analyser, loaded with different plastics is discussed and illustrated. Experimental results of the four-level multicell inverter driving a resistive load and an ultrasonic transducer tool are presented in this thesis. These results provide proof that the multicell inverter topology is capable of driving a non-linear load. The inverter was tested with the ultrasonic load as an ultrasonic <b>plastic</b> <b>welder</b> <b>and</b> an ultrasonic drill. The welding joints on the plastic samples are also evaluated in order to evaluate {{whether or not this}} solution is suitable for plastic welding. The ultrasonic drilling results are also shown in this thesis. It is further illustrated that the ultrasonic tool and power supply combination may be used in other ultrasonic applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{accuracy}} of an adopted cohesive zone model (CZM) {{can affect the}} simulated fracture response signifi-cantly. The CZM has been usually obtained using global experimental response, e. g., load versus either crack opening displacement or load-line displacement. Apparent-ly, deduction of a local material property from a global response does not provide full confidence of the adopted model. The difficulties are: (1) fundamentally, stress cannot be measured directly and the cohesive stress distribution is non-uniform; (2) accurate measurement of the full crack profile (crack opening displacement at every point) is experimentally difficult to obtain. An attractive feature of digital image correlation (DIC) {{is that it allows}} relatively accurate measurement of the whole displacement field on a flat surface. It has been utilized to measure the mode I traction-separation relation. A hybrid inverse method based on combined use of DIC and finite element method is used in this study to compute the cohesive properties of a ductile adhesive, Devcon <b>Plastic</b> <b>Welder</b> II, <b>and</b> a quasi-brittle plastic, G- 10 /FR 4 Garolite. Fracture tests were conducted on single edge-notched beam specimens (SENB) under four-point bending. A full-field DIC algorithm was employed to compute the smooth and continuous displace-ment field, which is then used as input to a finite element model for inverse analysis through an optimization proce-dure. The unknown CZM is constructed using a flexible B-spline without any “a priori ” assumption on the shape. The inversely computed CZMs for both materials yield consis-tent results. Finally, the computed CZMs are verified through fracture simulation, which shows good experimental agreement. Keywords Digital image correlation (DIC). Full-field DIC. Cohesive zone model (CZM).

5000|$|With speed welding, the <b>plastic</b> <b>welder,</b> {{similar to}} a {{soldering}} iron in appearance and wattage, is fitted with a feed tube for the plastic weld rod. The speed tip heats the rod and the substrate, {{while at the same}} time it presses the molten weld rod into position. A bead of softened plastic is laid into the joint, and the parts and weld rod fuse. With some types of plastic such as polypropylene, the melted welding rod must be [...] "mixed" [...] with the semi-melted base material being fabricated or repaired. These welding techniques have been improved over time and have been utilized for over 50 years by professional plastic <b>fabricators</b> <b>and</b> repairers internationally. Speed tip welding method is a much faster welding technique and with practice can be used in tight corners.A version of the speed tip [...] "gun" [...] is essentially a soldering iron with a broad, flat tip that can be used to melt the weld joint and filler material to create a bond.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Background: Workers chronically {{exposed to}} {{manganese}} in welding fumes may develop an extra-pyramidal syndrome with postural and action tremors. Objectives: To determine {{the utility of}} tremor analysis in distinguishing tremors among workers exposed to welding fumes, patients with Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease (IPD) and Essential Tremor (ET). Methods: Retrospective study of recorded tremor in subjects from academic Movement Disorders Clinics <b>and</b> <b>Welders.</b> Quantitative tremor analysis was performed and associated with clinical status. Results: Postural tremor intensity was increased in <b>Welders</b> <b>and</b> ET and was associated with visibly greater amplitude of tremor with arms extended. Mean center frequencies (Cf) of <b>welders</b> <b>and</b> patients with ET {{were significantly higher than}} the mean Cf of PD subjects. Although both the <b>welders</b> <b>and</b> the ET group exhibited a higher Cf with arms extended, welders could be distinguished from the ET subjects by a significantly lower Cf of the rest tremor than that measured in ET subjects. Conclusions: In the context of an appropriate exposure history and neurological examination, tremor analysi...|$|R
