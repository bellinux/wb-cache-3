Measuring teachers’ <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> requires tests which focus on specific knowledge types and subjects. However, there are only few <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> tests analysing teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge of using models and chemistry language in chemistry classes. The following article describes {{the development of a}} pedagogical content knowledge test for chemistry teachers, which focuses on teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge regarding the handling of models and chemistry language. As a result the test measures the intended construct reliably...|$|R

The current situation of <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> is scrutinised with particular regard {{to the location of}} educational study within the faculties of education. The fate of disciplinary patterns of study, which have come under attack from the proponents of more practical perspectives, are also examined. As practical perspectives promoted by a wide spectrum of advocates have become part of the fashionable discourse around teacher education, these perspectives are examined and some of the results of such practical fundamentalism are held up for scrutiny. It is argued that confining <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> entirely within the practical domain would not seem to be a well-thought out strategy for raising professional standards. A more active notion of teachers' <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> can, and should, be explored, and consolidated by work which focuses on the teacher's life and work, using more reflective and 'public intellectual' modes...|$|R

Building on the international IEA Teacher Education and Development Study – Learning to Teach Mathematics (TEDS-M), this paper describes a more situated way of evaluating the <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> of teachers. The theoretical framework of the follow-up study of TEDS-M takes up the novice-expert framework and analyses via video-based assessment instruments the structure and development of the <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> of mathematics teachers.

Very few studies to date have considered the market reaction to the announcement of <b>credit</b> watch <b>procedures</b> and the impact of <b>credit</b> watch <b>procedures</b> upon the market reaction to credit rating changes. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by focusing on <b>credit</b> watch <b>procedures</b> at the sovereign level. Our primary finding is that re-ratings which follow watch procedures are neither more nor less informative, and we conclude therefore that the <b>credit</b> watch <b>procedure</b> does not impact upon the private information of credit rating agencies. In addition we provide evidence on the types of sovereign state for which <b>credit</b> watch <b>procedures</b> are invoked and of the relative activities at the sovereign level of three major rating agencie...|$|R

This research also analyzed the differences in perceptions between groups in term of the external auditors of gender, type of representation, role, job title, education and experience. This research was conducted through a questionnaire survey method to the auditors on the representation of BPK RI. The samples used in the research were 363 respondents.

30|$|An {{important}} {{facet of}} professional competence is the <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{acquired by the}} trainees. It {{is defined as the}} knowledge that people need to practice their profession, for example, to solve complex problems at workplace (Kirschner 2013; Riedl 2003). Measuring <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> is considered as a suitable form of quality assessment for VET programs (Gschwendtner 2011; Nickolaus et al. 2012). Consequently, the first instruments for the evaluation of such programs addressed <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge,</b> e.g. for mechanical technicians (Abele et al. 2013) and for commercial business clerks (Achtenhagen and Winther 2014). However, to our knowledge, there are no validated instruments for VET programs in biology and medicine currently existing, despite the important role of laboratory assistants in hospitals, research institutes, and industries. To address this gap, we have developed a paper-and-pencil test (<b>Professional</b> <b>Knowledge</b> of Laboratory Assistants or PROKLAS). We validated it in this study with N =  284 VET students, that allows for the assessment of their <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> of laboratory tasks in biochemistry and cell biology. In this paper, we use the term “laboratory assistants” for “laboratory assistants in biology and medicine”, and “laboratory tasks” for “laboratory tasks in biochemistry and cell biology”.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the understandings (‘constructs’) of teachers’ <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> and its sources that underpin current practice in initial teacher education in Kazakhstan {{and in particular}} the way in which pedagogika contributes to these. Drawing on empirical data collected over four years, the paper illustrates the ways in which <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> and <b>professional</b> preparation of teachers in pre-service institutions are constructed within the Kazakh and Soviet pedagogical traditions, albeit with some reference to international scholars. Teachers’ <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> is formed from pedagogic theory mediated by academic staff in what is seen by many from outside and inside the country who are engaged in educational ‘reform’ in Kazakhstan as a largely didactic style with little or no critical engagement or exploration of the implications for practice. This stands in contrast with two recent professional development programmes: the Collaborative Action Research and Center of Excellence, which are focused on interactive learning and teaching, reflective practice, classroom action research, and teachers’ collaboration as sources for teachers’ <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge.</b> This paper highlights this contrast and begins to explore what happens when these two different approaches to the construction of teachers’ <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> encounter each other.

It therefore can be used also as a prognostic tool to test the <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> at different stages in the VET program. Since its design covers a broad range of topics in biochemistry (including chemistry and genetics) and cell biology (including immunology and microbiology), it also can be used to assess <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> in domain related and ecological aspects.

Students' {{personal}} professional {{theories in}} competence-based vocational education: {{the construction of}} personal knowledge through internalisation and socialisation. Journal of Vocational Education & Training, 61 (4), 481 - 494. Competence-based vocational education {{is based on a}} constructivist learning paradigm, where the development of students’ personal <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> is emphasised. However, {{there is a lack of}} insight into how students construct their own <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> and what the content and nature of personal <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> is. This article elaborates the concept Personal Professional Theory (PPT) : a personal knowledge base in which <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> and beliefs are internalised. PPTs are built upon a combination of declarative and procedural knowledge and are stored in the long-term memory. Furthermore, knowledge in PPTs refers to compiled knowledge which can be specified and applied to different professional situations. These PPTs develop through an interrelated process of internalisation and socialisation, in which students grow into the existing body of shared knowledge and collective norms, values and beliefs of professionals of an occupational domain. It is concluded that the elaboration of PPTs can be used to stimulate and monitor personal <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> development in vocational education, but further research into the content and nature of PPTs is required...|$|R
40|$|This is {{an inquiry}} {{into the nature of}} the student needs and {{knowledge}} in the distance education and the lifelong education that is being provided in the social sciences. What kinds of university learning in the social sciences do students enrolled in distance education and lifelong education courses at Open Universities want? Two somewhat ambiguous explanations can be used to answer this question. The first is that students need to acquire <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and the second is that they wish to master the liberal arts and acquire bildung knowledge in the social sciences. In the university social science education, it may be essential to investigate scientific problems and to acquire <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The relation between two kinds of knowledge needs to be stressed: as students needs more <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge,</b> the knowledge itself generally must become more integrated. Sometimes <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge,</b> which the social sciences generates in large quantities, is liable to diverge in fragments, and this fragmentary knowledge often creates a state of complexity and uncertainty which we cannot understand. When this occurs we must know well enough and have the talent to piece together the fragments of knowledge. We must keep the essence of the scientific knowledge in sight, integrating the fragmentary knowledge. It is important for us to synthesize the pieces of <b>professional</b> <b>knowledge</b> and reconstruct the meaning of the knowledge in the social sciences. ...|$|R
