Dead plant matter {{is placed on}} the agar surface in a <b>petri</b> <b>plate</b> and allowed to incubate for several days to a week. Then the edges of the substrates are scanned with a compound microscope and species are identified by their fruiting body morphology and amoebal morphology.|$|E

50|$|Petri first studied {{medicine}} at the Kaiser Wilhelm Academy for Military Physicians (1871-1875) and received his medical degree in 1876. He continued his studies at the Charité Hospital in Berlin and had active duty as a military physician until 1882, continuing then as a reservist. From 1877 to 1879 {{he was assigned to}} the Imperial Health Office (Kaiserliches Gesundheitsamt) in Berlin, where he became an assistant to Robert Koch. On the suggestion of Angelina Hesse, the New York-born wife of another assistant, Walther Hesse, the Koch laboratory began to culture bacteria on agar plates. Petri then invented the standard culture dish, or <b>Petri</b> <b>plate,</b> and further developed the technique of agar culture to purify or clone bacterial colonies derived from single cells. This advance made it possible to rigorously identify the bacteria responsible for diseases.|$|E
50|$|P. dendritiformis is {{a social}} microorganism: when grown under growth {{conditions}} that mimic natural environments such as hard surfaces, it forms colonies of 109-1012 cells with remarkably complex and dynamic architectures (Figure 1).

30|$|The {{optical sensor}} was {{prepared}} {{by using the}} polymer inclusion method described in our earlier work (Bhagat et al., 2007).

40|$|A {{combination}} of two compatible biological control agents, Bacillus subtilis CA 32 and Trichoderma harzianum RU 01, both antagonistic to the pathogen Rhizoctonia solani, was used to control damping-off in Solanum melongena and Capsicum annuum. Radial growth of the mycelium of R. solani was inhibited by T. harzianum RU 01 in dual <b>Petri</b> <b>plate</b> assay. T. harzianum RU 01 was capable to invading the whole surface of the pathogen colony, sporulating on it and suppress the production of sclerotia of R. solani. Microscopic studies showed the hyphae of R. solani surrounded by the T. harzianum RU 01 and subsequent disintegration. B. subtilis CA 32 produced a zone of inhibition only with the pathogen and no sings of antagonism between the bacteria and T. harzianum RU 01 on dual <b>Petri</b> <b>plate</b> assay. Significant plant protection was achieved when either B. subtilis added to the seeds or T. harzianum added to soil. However, when combine application of biocontrol agents, seed bacterization and T. harzianum application to soil, significantly enhanced the plant protection from R. solani. Soil application of B. subtilis and seed application of T. harzianum either singly or in combination did not protect from R. solani infection indicating {{that the importance of}} mode of application of biocontrol agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of agricultural residue derived vermicompost in providing protection against various plant diseases, especially against soil-borne plant pathogens {{has been studied}} extensively. In the previous studies effective control of soil-borne plant pathogen infections was observed on application of vermicompost. Most of the research is focused on elucidating the mechanism of soil – borne pathogen suppression and the potential types of interactions between micro-flora of vermicompost and the pathogens. The current study was aimed at assessing the potential for suppression of Fusariumoxysporum (causative agent of Fusarial wilt of common vegetable crops) by Trichoderma and Aspergillussp. isolated from Vermicompost. Mycelial disc (5 mm diameter) of F. oxysporum was placed at one edge of <b>Petri</b> <b>plate</b> containing PDA and incubated at 270 C for four days. Forty eight hours later, mycelial discs (5 mm in diameter) of Trichoderma isolate {{was placed on the}} opposite side facing F. oxysporumin the same <b>Petri</b> <b>plate</b> and incubated. The results showed that Aspergillus sp. and Trichoderma sp. effectively suppressed F. oxysporum. This indicates that the fungal isolates from vermicompost have antagonistic effect against the plant pathogen. This study gives substantial evidence for the suppressive nature of vermicompost, which has the potential to replace the currently used fungicides in agriculture...|$|E
40|$|We {{described}} previously {{a simple}} test on <b>petri</b> <b>plates</b> for detecting many carcinogens as mutagens using an especially sensitive set of bacterial strains to detect mutagens and a rat, or human, liver homogenate for carcinogen activation. We now extend {{the utility of}} the method for the detection of mutagenic metabolites in urine. The addition of commercial β-glucuronidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 31) to the <b>petri</b> <b>plates</b> along with the urine, liver homogenate, and bacteria allows detection of metabolites that are excreted in urine as β-glucuronide conjugates. By this method mutagenic activity is readily demonstrated with urine of rats that were administered as little as 200 μg (1. 6 mg/kg) of the carcinogen, 2 -acetylaminofluorene. In this case the major urinary metabolite that we detect appears to be a glucuronide conjugate. We propose that the method be used for the screening of human urines in order to detect mutagenic metabolites of drugs and of dietary components. It may also be useful for testing of urinary metabolites of drugs and food additives in experimental animals...|$|R
