The sun-facing surface of the solar cell, known as the emitter, is particularly important when designing a solar cell. This work focused first on an alternative method of forming the emitter of silicon solar cells, and secondly on a method for improving the surface passivation of both these non-traditional and standard n-type solar cells. Top-down aluminum induced crystallization (TAIC) was used for forming a <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>layer</b> from amorphous silicon using aluminum to catalyze the crystallization at much lower temperatures than otherwise possible. Inherent to TAIC is the doping of the resultant crystalline silicon by the aluminum, an acceptor impurity. Thus, n-type solar cells with p-type polycrystalline emitters were fabricated. It was found that several variations of this crystallization process occurred and their effect on solar cell performance was analyzed. An inherent disadvantage to this method was the presence of defects at the junction of the highest efficiency solar cells fabricated. These defects were passivated by an atomic hydrogen treatment. Another method of improving solar cells was invented, theoretically modeled, and experimentally explored. The process improves silicon solar cells by hydrogen inactivation of acceptor impurities in the emitter (shown for both aluminum and boron in silicon).

We have devised two strategies for the fast, low-temperature growth of thin <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> films on glass substrates. The first is the direct growth of <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> on SiO 2 by HWCVD. We use atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize fully continuous <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> films grown by HWCVD on SiO 2, {{as well as the}} nucleation density of silicon islands formed {{in the early stages of}} HWCVD growth, as a function of temperature and hydrogen dilution (H 2 :SiH 4). Our observations of the nucleation kinetics of Si on SiO 2 can be explained by a rate-equation pair-binding model, from which we derive an estimate for the prefactor and activation energy for surface diffusion of Si on SiO 2 during HWCVD growth and assess the viability of this method for the rapid growth of large-grained <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> on SiO 2. The second strategy uses large-grained (100 microns) <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>layers</b> fabricated by selective nucleation and solid-phase epitaxy (SNSPE) on SiO 2 substrates as templates for epitaxial growth by HWCVD. Using reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have derived a phase diagram for Si on Si(100) consisting of epitaxial, twinned epitaxial, mixed epitaxial/polycrystalline, and polycrystalline phases of growth on Si(100) in the 50 nm? 2 micron thickness regime. Evidence is also presented for epitaxial growth on SNSPE templates, which use nickel nanoparticles as nucleation sites for the solid-phase crystallization of phosphorus-doped amorphous silicon on SiO 2. Minority carrier lifetimes for films on Si(100), as measured by resonant-coupled photoconductive decay experiments, range from 5. 7 to 14. 8 microseconds while those for films on SNSPE templates range from 5. 9 to 19. 3 microseconds.

Initial films were deposited using low-temperature plasma enhanced deposition technique. The structural {{properties of the}} films were characterized using the spectroscopy of Raman scattering, excited by the argon laser (line 514. 5 nm) and using electron microscopy. For the femtosecond pulse treatments the ablation threshold {{was found to be}} some more than 65 mJ/cm 2. When pulse energy density was lower than ~ 30 mJ/cm 2 no structural changes were observed. In optimal regimes the films were found to be fully crystallized with needle grain structure, according to the Raman scattering and electron microscopy data. Estimates show the pulse energy density was lower than the Si melting threshold, so non-thermal “explosive ” impacts may play some role. The main result in nanosecond XeCl and KrF laser pulse crystallization is the narrower window between beginning of crystallization and ablation for KrF laser (wavelength 248 nm) than for the XeCl laser (wavelength 308 nm).

40|$|Performance of <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> {{thin film}} solar cells {{is limited by}} high defect density {{solid-phase}} crystallised material. A common approach to obtaining <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> films with fewer defects is epitaxy on a high crystal quality seed layer. Such a seed layer can be produced by aluminium-induced crystallisation but it results in films with heavy metal contamination. This work investigates an alternative seed layer prepared by solid-phase crystallisation of heavily phosphorous doped (≥ 1 × 1020 cm- 3) ultra-thin (≤ 200 nm) silicon films which then can serve as the cell emitter. The effects of the a-Si precursor thickness and phosphorous concentration on the solid-phase crystallisation kinetics, structural and electronic qualities of the crystallised seed layer are analysed. By increasing the film thickness from 50 nm to 200 nm or increasing the phosphorous concentration up to 3 × 1020 cm- 3, the time needed for complete crystallisation decreases and the structural and electronic quality of the seed <b>layer</b> improves. <b>Polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> thin film solar cells on glass are successfully fabricated by solid-phase epitaxy and vapour-phase epitaxy on the solid-phase crystallised P-doped <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> seed <b>layer.</b> Solid-phase epitaxial layers achieve much better structural quality, longer minority diffusion length and thus better solar cell performance than the vapour-phase epitaxial layers. Therefore, solid-phase epitaxy on the randomly oriented solid-phase crystallised <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> seed <b>layer</b> is more suitable than the vapour-phase epitaxy. Seed layer thickness and phosphorous concentration can influence its crystal quality and thus affect the epitaxial solar cell performance. Transmission electron microscopy analysis proves that the intragrain defects (stacking faults, twins, and dislocations) originate from the seed layer thus limiting the solar cell performance. In order to eliminate the intragrain defects in the seed layer, two different approaches are attempted: rapid thermal and diode laser annealing. Increasing peak temperature of rapid thermal annealing can effectively lower the intragrain defect density and thus improve the structural and electronic qualities of the seed layer. Consequently, both solid-phase and vapour-phase epitaxial polycrystalline solar cells on the rapid thermal processed seed layer show better performance with higher cell efficiency, open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and spectral response than the cells on the seed layer without rapid thermal annealing. Therefore, epitaxially grown solar cell performance is directly determined {{by the quality of}} the seed layer. Line-focus diode laser annealing allows achieving a higher Si film temperature without overheating the glass substrate. Due to efficient defect elimination by laser annealing, a higher dopant activation efficiency, carrier mobility and lower sheet resistance are achieved. However, after epitaxial growth on the diode laser annealed seed layer, the interface between seed layer and epi-layer contains a large density of planar defects. These interface defects strongly limit the quality improvement by the diode laser annealing. Finally, comparison between the solid-phase crystallisation and solid-phase epitaxy on the seed layer are made. The seed layer approach does not result in better solar cell performance than the solid-phase crystallisation. Transmission electron microscopy analysis proves that the defects located at the interface between seed layer and epi-layer can limit the solar cell performance of the epitaxial grown <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thin <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> poly Si <b>layers</b> can {{be formed}} by Aluminium Induced Crystallisation AIC of {{amorphous}} Silicon a Si. During annealing the initial glass Al a Si layer structure {{is transformed into}} a glass poly Si Al Si structure. For the overall process the structure of the Al layer is very important. In this paper the effect of oxygen in the aluminium layer on process time and grain size is discussed. It was found that low oxygen flows fO 2 1 sccm during Al depositions cause a significant reduction in process time. However the grain size of the resulting poly Si films is not affected. Further increase of fO 2 does not result in further acceleration of the proces...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} a <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> (poly-Si) seeding <b>layer</b> on the {{properties}} of relaxor Pb(Zr 0. 53,Ti 0. 47) O 3 -Pb(Zn 1 / 3,Nb 2 / 3) O 3 (PZT-PZN) thin films and energy-harvesting cantilevers was studied. We deposited thin films of the relaxor on two substrates, with and without a poly-Si seeding layer. The seeding layer, which {{also served as a}} sacrificial layer to facilitate cantilever release, was found to improve morphology, phase purity, crystal orientation, and electrical properties. We attributed these results to reduction of the number of nucleation sites and, therefore, to an increase in relaxor film grain size. The areal power density of the wet-based released harvester was measured. The power density output of the energy harvester with this relaxor composition and the poly-Si seeding layer was 325 μW/cm 2...|$|R
40|$|Liquid phase {{crystallization}} LPC is {{a promising}} technique to fabricate high quality <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>silicon</b> absorber <b>layers</b> on cheap glass substrates. Recently, we achieved open circuit voltages above 580 mV using a silicon heterojunction and a newly developed single sided contact system. However, the still moderate efficiency of 5. 7 {{can be attributed}} to short circuit current densities not exceeding 16 mA cm 2, caused by optical losses and absorber recombination. An approach to tackle the first problem is presented in this work. In general, a proper light management concept for thin film devices involve specially designed anti reflective coatings ARC and textured surfaces {{on both sides of the}} device, to enhance the optical path of the cell. As the crystals achieved using LPC are up to cm in length, commonly used wet chemical treatments using in wafer based PV are applicable here, too. However providing a texture to the substrate silicon interface is more complex as the texture as well as all layers deposited before the crystallization process must withstand the high temperatures present during LPC. However it is possible to deposit adequate inter layers that enable LPC on randomly textured substrates as shown in this wor...|$|R
