5|$|As {{noted by}} several critics and commentators, the film's story and style mirror {{elements}} from Gaston Leroux's The <b>Phantom</b> of the Opera. V and the <b>Phantom</b> both wear masks {{to hide their}} disfigurements, control others through the leverage of their imaginations, have tragic pasts, and are motivated by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of The <b>Phantom</b> of the Opera, where the masked <b>Phantom</b> takes Christine Daaé to his subterranean lair to re-educate her.|$|E
5|$|Christine takes a {{carriage}} {{to visit her}} father's grave, but the <b>Phantom</b> secretly takes over the reins. Raoul follows when he realizes she's gone. Christine arrives and laments over her father's death. The <b>Phantom</b> tries to win her back by pretending to be her father's angel, but Raoul arrives and stops him. A sword fight ensues in the cemetery, where Raoul eventually disarms the <b>Phantom</b> {{and is about to}} kill him, but Christine pleads for him not to. His rage seemingly augmented, the <b>Phantom</b> watches angrily as Christine and Raoul ride away.|$|E

40|$|The ICRU Report on `Phantoms and Computational Models in Radiation Therapy, Diagnosis and Protection' is presented. Different {{types of}} <b>phantoms</b> may be defined. They may be broadly {{categorised}} {{according to their}} primary function: dosimetry, calibration and imaging. Within each functional category, there are 3 types or designs of phantoms: body <b>phantoms</b> (anthropomorphic), standard <b>phantoms</b> and reference <b>phantoms</b> (used in the definition and specification of certain radiation quantities). In radiological imaging, anthropomorphic body <b>phantoms</b> are used for measuring the absorbed dose distribution resulting from imaging procedures. Standard <b>phantoms</b> have simple reproducible geometry and are used for comparing measurements under standard conditions of exposure. Imaging <b>phantoms</b> are useful for evaluating a given imaging system; they contain different types of test pieces. The Report contains a major section on human anatomy, from fetus to adult with the variations due to ethnic origin. Tolerance levels for the <b>phantoms</b> (composition, dimensions) are proposed and quality assurance programs are outlined. The report contains extensive appendices: human anatomical data and full specification of over 80 <b>phantoms</b> and computational models. ICRU Report 46 on `Photon, electron, proton and neutron interaction data for body tissues' {{is closely related to}} the field of <b>phantoms.</b> It is a logical continuation on ICRU Report 44 (1989) on `Tissue substitutes in radiation dosimetry and measurements' and contains the interaction data for more than 100 tissues, from fetal to adult, including some diseased tissues...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Phantom</b> brings Christine {{back down}} to his lair. Madame Giry shows Raoul where the <b>Phantom</b> lives, and he goes to rescue Christine. The <b>Phantom</b> forces Christine to don the wedding dress and once again professes his love, and orders Christine to marry him. Christine tries to {{convince}} the <b>Phantom</b> {{that she does not}} fear his ugliness, but rather his anger and willingness to kill to get what he wants. Just then, Raoul enters the lair, and the <b>Phantom</b> ties him to a gate and threatens to kill him if Christine refuses to marry him. Christine reflects over the impossible choice before passionately kissing the <b>Phantom</b> to show him he is not alone in the world. The <b>Phantom</b> is shocked from experiencing real human love {{for the first time in}} his life. Ashamed of his murderous actions, he allows Christine and Raoul to leave and orders them to never return. He finds comfort in a little monkey music box. Christine approaches the <b>Phantom,</b> who tells her that he loves her, and she silently gives him the diamond ring from her finger to remember her by. After Christine and Raoul leave, the <b>Phantom</b> smashes every mirror in his underground lair and disappears through a secret passage behind a velvet curtain just before the police arrive. Upon entering, Meg finds only the Phantom's white mask.|$|E

5|$|The RAF {{operated}} the <b>Phantom</b> {{from a number}} of bases in the UK, Germany and the Falkland Islands during its operational service, while the Royal Navy initially based its <b>Phantom</b> units at its main air station at Yeovilton; following the disbanding of the Fleet Air Arm's dedicated training squadron, its sole operational <b>Phantom</b> squadron was subsequently moved to take up residence at the RAF's base at Leuchars.|$|E
5|$|Around 15 RAF squadrons {{received}} various {{marks of}} <b>Phantom,</b> {{many of them}} based in Germany. The first to be equipped was No. 6 Squadron at RAF Leuchars in July 1969.

While the ballet is being performed, the <b>Phantom,</b> not realizing the performance change, encounters the chief stagehand Joseph Buquet and strangles him before hanging him from above, creating chaos. Christine flees to the roof with Raoul. She reveals to him that she has seen the Phantom's face and fears him, but also pities him because of his sadness. Raoul tells Christine he loves her and will protect her forevermore. Christine returns his love, kissing him passionately and they both leave the roof. The <b>Phantom,</b> who witnessed the scene, becomes heartbroken. He then hears them both singing together. Growing furious at Raoul, he vows revenge on them both.|$|E

40|$|A pair {{of walking}} <b>phantoms</b> was {{developed}} from deformable mesh <b>phantoms</b> to represent individuals walking on contaminated ground. The Monte Carlo N-particle extended version code {{was used to}} calculate organ doses from ground contamination scenarios involving parallel and isotropic planar sources of Cs- 137 and Co- 60 with concentrations of 30 kBqm− 2. For the parallel plane source case, the organ doses were up to 78 % greater for walking <b>phantoms</b> than those for the standing <b>phantoms.</b> The dose difference is because the widely open legs during walking provide less shielding to several organs, especially the kidneys, ovaries and liver, from parallel sources. The effective doses of the walking <b>phantoms</b> were on average 15 % higher than the standing <b>phantoms.</b> On the other hand, when isotropic planar sources were considered, no significant dose difference was observed. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using deformable <b>phantoms</b> to represent realistic postures for organ dose calculations in environmental dosimetry studies...|$|R
