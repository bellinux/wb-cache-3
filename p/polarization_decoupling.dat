Even though galvanometer-based scanners offer flexibility, speed and accuracy at a relatively low cost, they still lack the necessary control over the polarization required for certain applications. We report on the development of a polarization steerable system assembled with a fiber polarization controller and a galvanometric scanner, both controlled by a digital signal processor board. The system implements control of the <b>polarization</b> <b>decoupled</b> from the pointing direction through a feed-forward control scheme. This enables to direct optical beams to a desired direction without affecting its initial polarization state. When considering the full working field of view, we are able to compensate polarization angle errors larger than 0. 2 rad, in a temporal window of less than ∼ 20 ms. Given the unification of components to fully control any polarization state while steering an optical beam, the proposed system is potentially integrable and robust.

40|$|Radiative {{transport}} theory describes {{the propagation of}} light in random media that absorb, scatter, and emit radiation. To describe the propagation of light, the full polarization state is quantified using the Stokes parameters. For the sake of mathematical convenience, the polarization state of light is often neglected leading to the scalar radiative transport equation for the intensity only. For scalar {{transport theory}}, there is a well-established body of literature on numerical and analytic approximations to the radiative transport equation. We extend the scalar theory to the vector radiative transport equation (vRTE). In particular, {{we are interested in}} the theoretical basis for a phenomena called circular polarization memory. Circular polarization memory is the physical phenomena whereby circular polarization retains its ellipticity and handedness when propagating in random media. This is in contrast to the propagation of linear polarization in random media, which depolarizes at a faster rate, and specular reflection of circular polarization, whereby the circular polarization handedness flips. We investigate two limits that are of known interest in the phenomena of circular polarization memory. The first limit we investigate is that of forward-peaked scattering, i. e. the limit where most scattering events occur in the forward or near-forward directions. The second limit we consider is that of strong scattering and weak absorption. In the forward-peaked scattering limit we approximate the vRTE by a system of partial differential equations motivated by the scalar Fokker-Planck approximation. We call the leading order approximation the vector Fokker-Planck approximation. The vector Fokker Planck approximation predicts that strongly forward-peaked media exhibit circular polarization memory where the strength of the effect can be calculated from the expansion of the scattering matrix in special functions. In addition, we find in this limit that total intensity, linear polarization, and circular <b>polarization</b> <b>decouple.</b> From this result we conclude, that in the Fokker-Planck limit the scalar approximation is an appropriate leading order approximation. In the strong scattering and weak absorbing limit the vector radiative transport equation can be analyzed using boundary layer theory. In this case, the problem of light scattering in an optically thick medium is reduced to a 1 D vRTE near the boundary and a 3 D diffusion equation in the interior. We develop and implement a numerical solver for the boundary layer problem by using a discrete ordinate solver in the boundary layer and a spectral method to solve the diffusion approximation in the interior. We implement the method in Fortran 95 with external dependencies on BLAS, LAPACK, and FFTW. By analyzing the spectrum of the discretized vRTE in the boundary layer, we are able to predict the presence of circular polarization memory in a given medium...|$|R

40|$|X-ray photons {{emitted from}} the surface or {{atmosphere}} of a magnetized neutron star are highly polarized. However, the observed polarization may be modified due to photon propagation through the star’s magnetosphere.

We study the evolution of photon polarization in the magnetized QED vacuum of a neutron star magnetosphere, paying particular attention to the propagation effect across the quasi-tangential (QT) point, where the photon momentum is nearly aligned with the magnetic field. In agreement with previous studies, we find that in most regions of the magnetosphere, the photon <b>polarization</b> modes are <b>decoupled</b> due to vacuum birefringence, and therefore a large net linear polarization can be expected when the radiation escapes the magnetosphere.

We then show analytically that the path integrals for the transverse-electric (TE) polarization coupled to a dielectric medium converge to the proper solutions in certain special cases, including the Casimir-Polder potential of an atom near a planar interface, and the Casimir energy due to two planar interfaces. We also evaluate the path integrals numerically via Monte-Carlo path-averaging for these cases, studying the convergence and performance of the resulting computational techniques. While these scalar methods are only exact in particular geometries, they may serve as an approximation for Casimir energies for the vector electromagnetic field in other geometries.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} the origin and effect of virtual electrode <b>polarization</b> in uniform, <b>decoupled</b> and non-uniform cardiac tissue during field stimulation. METHODS: A discrete bidomain model with active membrane behaviour was used to simulate normal cardiac tissue as well as cardiac tissue that is decoupled due to fibrosis and gap junction remodelling. Various uniform and non-uniform electric fields were applied to the external domain of uniform, decoupled and non-uniform resting cardiac tissue as well as cardiac tissue in which spiral waves were induced. RESULTS: Field stimulation applied on non-uniform tissue results in more virtual electrodes compared with uniform tissue. The spiral waves were terminated in decoupled tissue, but not in uniform, homogeneous tissue. By gradually increasing local differences in intracellular conductivities, the amount and spread of virtual electrodes increased and the spiral waves were terminated. CONCLUSION: Fast depolarization of the tissue after field stimulation may be explained by intracellular decoupling and spatial heterogeneity present in normal and pathological cardiac tissue. We demonstrated that termination of spiral waves by means of field stimulation can be achieved when the tissue is modelled as a non-uniform, anisotropic bidomain with active membrane behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{treats the}} problem of {{line-of-sight}} (LOS) parameter estimation in strong multipath environments. In the case of highly temporally and spatially correlated {LOS} and multipath signals, such as urban canyons, common multipath mitigation methods are highly degraded, as signal separation cannot be performed in the spatio temporal domain. In this case, we exploit the {LOS} and multipath <b>polarization</b> diversity to <b>decouple</b> the signals using an antenna array with right-hand-circular polarization (RHCP) and left-hand-circular polarization (LHCP) feeds. The multipath direction- of-arrival (DOA) and polarization coefficients can effectively be estimated from the {LHCP} spatial covariance matrix. The {LOS} {DOA} can be estimated from the {RHCP} spatial covariance matrix. The spatial covariance matrices are calculated from the outputs of a matched correlator bank. The {DOA} and polarization estimates are used to implement a dual polarization beamformer, which maximizes the {LOS} energy and suppresses multipath energy over both polarizations. The {LOS} time-delay is estimated from the beamformer output with a maximum-likelihood estimator with a significantly reduced number of parameters and computational complexity in comparison to a full model estimator.

40|$|The {{coherence}} time of an electron spin decohered by the nuclear spin environment in a quantum dot can be substantially increased by subjecting the electron to suitable dynamical decoupling sequences. We analyze {{the performance of}} high-level decoupling protocols by {{using a combination of}} analytical and exact numerical methods, and by paying special attention to the regimes of large inter-pulse delays and long-time dynamics, which are outside the reach of standard average Hamiltonian theory descriptions. We demonstrate that dynamical decoupling can remain efficient far beyond its formal domain of applicability, and find that a protocol exploiting concatenated design provides best performance for this system in the relevant parameter range. In situations where the initial electron state is known, protocols able to completely freeze decoherence at long times are constructed and characterized. The impact of system and control non-idealities is also assessed, including the effect of intra-bath dipolar interaction, magnetic field bias and bath polarization, as well as systematic pulse imperfections. While small bias field and small bath <b>polarization</b> degrade the <b>decoupling</b> fidelity, enhanced performance and temporal modulation result from strong applied fields and high polarizations. Overall, we find that if the relative errors of the control parameters do not exceed 5 %, decoupling protocols can still prolong the {{coherence time}} by up to two orders of magnitude.

40|$|Research on {{multiple}} antenna systems {{has been a}} hot topic in recent years due to the demands for higher transmission rate and more reliable link in rich scattering environment in wireless communications. Using multiple antennas at both the transmitter side and the receiver side increases the channel capacity without additional frequency spectrum and transmitted power. However, due to the limited space at the size-limited terminal devices, the most critical problem in designing multiple antennas is the severe mutual coupling among them. The aim of this thesis is to provide compact, decoupled and efficient multiple antenna designs for terminal devices. At the same time, we propose a simple and cost effective method in multiple antenna measurement. All these efforts {{contribute to the development}} of terminal devices for the fourth generation wireless communication. The background and theory of multiple antenna systems are introduced first, in which three operating schemes of multiple antenna systems are discussed. Critical factors influencing the performance of multiple antenna systems are also analyzed in details. To design efficient multiple antenna systems in compact terminals, several decoupling methods, including defected ground plane, current localization, orthogonal <b>polarization</b> and <b>decoupling</b> networks, are proposed. The working mechanism and design procedure of each method are introduced, and their effectiveness is compared. Those methods can be applied to most of the terminal antennas, reducing the mutual coupling by at least 6 dB. In some special cases, especially for low frequency bands below 1 GHz, the chassis of the device itself radiates like an antenna, which complicates the antenna decoupling. Thus, we extend the general decoupling methods to the cases when the chassis is excited. Based on the characteristic mode analysis, three different solutions are provided, i. e., optimizing antenna locations, localizing antenna currents and creating orthogonal modes. These methods are applied to mobile phones, providing a more reliable link and a higher transmission rate, which are evaluated by diversity gain and channel capacity, respectively. In order to measure the performance of multiple antenna systems, it is necessary to obtain the correlation coefficients. However, the traditional measurement technique, which requires the phase and polarization information of the radiation patterns, is very expensive and time consuming. In this thesis, a more practical and convenient method is proposed. Fairly good accuracy is achieved when it is applied to various kinds of antennas. To design a compact and efficient multiple antenna system, besides the reduction of mutual coupling, the performance of each single antenna is also important. The techniques for antenna reconfiguration are demonstrated. Frequency and pattern reconfigurable antennas are constructed, providing more flexibility to multiple antenna systems. QC 2012060...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance is a robust tool {{in a broad}} range of scientific area from biochemistry, material science to MRI in medical application. In this thesis, two distinct works are presented in both solid sate and liquid state NMR. Firstly, benefiting from the fast MAS and cleverly designed devices, both resolution and sensitivity of solid state NMR spectra have been improved many folds, so that it is available to study complex biological solids, such as proteins. However there is always a need to increase resolution in order to work on more complicate systems. Here, we introduce a series of highly resolved scalar-based three-dimensional homonuclear correlation experiments for 13 C sidechain correlation in solid-state proteins. These experiments are based on a sensitive constant-time format, in which homonuclear scalar couplings are utilized for <b>polarization</b> transfer, but <b>decoupled</b> during chemical shift evolution, to yield high resolution in indirect dimensions and band selectivity as desired.

40|$|Loops of {{magnetic}} {{field in the}} corona are observed to oscillate and these oscillations have been posited to be the superposition of resonant kink waves. To date, most analyses of these oscillations have concentrated on calculating the frequency shifts that result from spatial variation in the kink wave speed. Further, most have ignored gravity and treated the loop as a straight tube. Here we ignore spatial variation in the wave speed, but self-consistently include the effects of gravity and loop curvature in both the equilibrium loop model and in the wave equation. We model a coronal loop as an isolated, thin, magnetic fibril that is anchored at two points in the photosphere. The equilibrium shape of the loop is determined by a balance between magnetic buoyancy and magnetic tension, which {{is characterized by a}} Magnetic Bond Number ϵ, that is typically small |ϵ| << 1. This balance produces a loop that has a variable radius of curvature. The resonant kink waves of such a loop come in two <b>polarizations</b> that are <b>decoupled</b> from each other: waves with motion completely within the plane of the loop (normal oscillations) and waves with motions that are completely horizontal, perpendicular to the plane of the loop (binormal oscillations). We solve for the eigensolutions of both polarizations using perturbation theory for small Magnetic Bond Number. For modes of the same order, normal oscillations have smaller eigenfrequencies than binormal oscillations. The additional forces of buoyancy and magnetic tension from the curvature of the loop increase and decrease the mode frequencies, respectively. The ratio of the frequencies of the first overtone to the fundamental mode is modified by the inclusion of buoyancy and curvature. We find that the normal polarization possesses a frequency ratio that exceeds the canonical value of 2, whereas the binormal polarization has a ratio less than 2.

40|$|The nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance of solids has long been characterized by very large spectral broadening which arises from internuclear dipole-dipole coupling or the nuclear electric quadrupole interaction. These couplings can obscure the smaller chemical shift interaction and make that information unavailable. Two important and difficult cases are that of hydrogen and deuterium. For example, the homonuclear dipolar broadening, HD, for hydrogen is usually several tens of kilohertz. For deuterium, HD is relatively small; however, the quadrupole interaction causes a broadening which can be hundreds of kilohertz in polycrystalline or amorphous solids. The development of cross <b>polarization,</b> heteronuclear radiofrequency <b>decoupling,</b> and coherent averaging of nuclear spin interactions has provided measurement of chemical shift tensors in solids. Recently, double quantum NMR and double quantum decoupling have led to measurement of deuterium and proton chemical shift tensors, respectively. A general problem of these experiments is the overlapping of the tensor powder pattern spectra of magnetically distinct sites which cannot be resolved. In this work, high resolution NMR of hydrogen and deuterium in solids is demonstrated. For both nuclei, the resonances are narrowed to obtain liquid-like isotropic spectra by high frequency rotation of the sample about an axis inclined at the magic angle, {beta}{sub m} = Arccos(3 {sup - 1 / 2 }), {{with respect to the}} direction of the external magnetic field. Two approaches have been developed for each nucleus. For deuterium, the powder spectra were narrowed by over three orders of magnitude by magic angle rotation with precise control of {beta}. A second approach was the observation of deuterium double quantum transitions under magic angle rotation. For hydrogen, magic angle rotation alone could be applied to obtain the isotropic spectrum when H{sub D} was small. This often occurs naturally when the nuclei are semi-dilute or involved in internal motion. In the general case of large H{sub D}, isotropic spectra were obtained by dilution of {sup 1 }H with {sup 2 }H combined with magic angle rotation. The resolution obtained represents the practical limit for proton NMR of solids. Theoretical and technical aspects are described in the text with comments on the application of the principles to other nuclei of interest...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to improve our {{knowledge}} on the theory of polarized line formation in a magneto-turbulent medium, and in a scattering dominated magnetized medium, where partial redistribution (PRD) effects become important. Thus the thesis consists of two parts. In the first part we carry out a detailed investigation {{on the effect of}} random magnetic fields on Zeeman line radiative transfer. In the second part we develop the theory of polarized line formation in the presence of arbitrary magnetic fields and with PRD. We present numerical methods of solution of the relevant transfer equation in both part-I and II. In Chapter I we give a general introduction, that describes the basic physical concepts required in both parts of the thesis. Chapters 2 - 6 deal with the part-I, namely stochastic polarized Zeeman line formation. Chapters 7 - 10 deal with part –II, namely the theory and numerics of polarized line formation in scattering media. Chapter II {{is devoted to}} the future outlook on the problems described in part-I and II of the thesis. Appendices are devoted to additional mathematical details. Part-I of the Thesis: Stochastic polarized line formation in magneto-turbulent media Magneto-convection on the Sun has a size spectrum that spans several orders of magnitudes and hence develops turbulent elements or eddies the sizes of which are much smaller than the spatial resolution of current spectro-polarimeters (about 0. 2 arcsec or 150 km at the photospheric level). We were thus strongly motivated to consider the Zeeman effect in a medium where the magnetic field is random with characteristic scales of variation comparable to the radiative transfer characteristic scales. In Chapter 2, we consider the micro-turbulent limit and study the mean zeeman absorption matrix in detail. The micro-turbulent limit refers to the case when the scales of fluctuations of the random field are much smaller than the photon mean free paths associated to the line formation. The ‘mean’ absorption and anomalous dispersion coefficients are calculated for random fields with a non-Zero mean value - isotropic or anisotropic Gaussian distributions that are azimuthally invariant about the direction of the mean field. The averaging method is described in detail, and fairly explicit expressions for the mean coefficients are established. A detailed numerical investigation of the mean coefficients illustrates two simple effects of the magnetic field fluctuations: (i) broadening of the components by fluctuations of the field strength, leaving the π-components unchanged, and (ii) averaging over the angular dependence of the π and components. Angular averaging can modify the frequency profiles of the mean coefficients quite drastically, namely, the appearance of an unpolarized central component in the diagonal absorption coefficient, even when the mean field is {{in the direction of the}} line-of-sight. For isotropic fluctuations, the mean coefficients can be expressed in terms of generalized Voigt and Faraday-Voigt functions, which are related to the derivatives of the Voigt and Faraday-Voigt functions. In chapter 3, we study these functions in detail. Simple recurrence relations are established and used for the calculation of the functions themselves and of their partial derivatives. Asymptotic expansions are also derived. In Chapter 4, we consider the Zeeman effect from a magnetic field which has a finite correlation length(meso-turbulence) that can be varied from zero to infinity and thus made comparable to the photon mean free-path. The random vector magnetic field B is modeled by a Kubo-Anderson process – a piecewise constant Markov process characterized by a correlation length and a probability distribution function(PDF) for the random values of the magnetic field. The micro- and macro-turbulent limits are recovered when the correlation length goes to zero or infinity respectively. Mean values and rms fluctuations around the mean values are calculated numerically for a random magnetic field with isotropic Gaussian fluctuations. The effects of a finite correlation length are discussed in detail. The rms fluctuations of the Stokes parameters are shown to be very sensitive to the correlation length of the magnetic field. It is suggested to use them as a diagnostic tools to determine the scale of unresolved features in the solar atmosphere. In Chapter 5, using statistical approach, we analyze the effects of random magnetic fields on Stokes line profiles. We consider the micro and macro-turbulent regimes, which provide bounds for more general random fields with finite scales of variations. The mean Stokes parameters are obtained in the micro-turbulent regime, by first averaging the Zeeman absorption matrix Φ over the PDF P(B) of the magnetic field and then solving the concerned radiative transfer equation. In the macro-turbulent regime, the mean solution is obtained by averaging the emergent solution over P(B). In this chapter, we consider the same Gaussian PDFs that are used to construct (Φ) in chapter 2. Numerical simulations of magneto-convection and analysis of solar magnetograms provide the empirical PDF for the magnetic field line-of-sight component on the solar atmosphere. In Chapter 6, we explore the effects of different kinds of PDFs on Zeeman line formation. We again consider the limits of micro and macro-turbulence. The types of PDFs considered are: (a) Voigt function and stretched exponential type PDFs for fields with fixed direction but fluctuating strength. (b) Cylindrically symmetrical power law for the angular distribution of magnetic fields with given field strength. (c) Composite PDFs accounting for randomness in both strength and direction obtained by combining a Voigt function or a stretched exponential with an angular power law. The composite PDF proposed has an angular distribution peaked about the vertical direction for strong fields and is nearly isotropically distributed for weak fields, which could mimic solar surface random fields. We also describe how the averaging technique for a normal Zeeman triplet may be generalized to the more common case of anomalous Zeeman splitting patterns. Part-II of the Thesis: Polarized line formation in scattering media-Theory and numerical methods Many of the strongest and most conspicuous lines in the Second Solar Spectrum are strong lines that are formed rather high, often in the chromosphere above the temperature minimum. From the standard, unpolarized and non-magnetic line-formation theory such lines are known to be formed under the conditions that are very far from local thermodynamic equilibrium. They are characterized by broad damping wings surrounding the line core. Doppler shifts in combination with collisions cause photons that are absorbed at a given frequency to be redistributed in frequency across the line profile in a complex way during the scattering process. Two idealized, limiting cases to describe this redistribution are “frequency coherence” and “complete redistribution” (CRD), but the general theory that properly combines these two limiting cases goes under the name “partial frequency redistribution” (PRD). Resonance lines which are usually strong can be properly modeled only when PRD is taken into account. To use these strong lines for magnetic field diagnostics we need a line scattering theory of PRD in the presence of magnetic fields of arbitrary strength. In the second part of the thesis we develop such a theory and derive the polarized PRD matrices. These matrices are then used in the polarized line transfer equation to compute the emergent Stokes parameters. Polarized scattering in spectral lines is governed by a 4 x 4 matrix that describes how the Stokes vector is scattered in all directions and redistributed in frequency within the line. In Chapter 7, using a classical approach we develop the theory for this redistribution matrix in the presence of magnetic fields of arbitrary strength and direction, and for a J = 0 → 1 → 0 transition. This case of arbitrary magnetic fields is called the Hanle-Zeeman regime, since it covers both the partially overlapping weak and strong-field regimes, in which the Hanle and Zeeman effects respectively dominate the scattering polarization. In this general regime the angle-frequency correlations that describe the so-called PRD are intimately coupled to the polarization properties. We also show how the classical theory can be extended to treat atomic and molecular scattering transitions for any combinations of J quantum numbers. In chapter 8, we show explicitly that for a J = 0 → 1 → 0 scattering transition there exists an equivalence between the Hanle-Zeeman redistribution matrix that is derived through quantum electrodynamics(Bommier 1997 b) and the one derived in Chapter 7 starting from the classical, time-dependent oscillator theory of Bommier & Stenflo (1999). This equivalence holds for all strengths and directions of the magnetic field. Several aspects of the Hanle-Zeeman redistribution matrix are illustrated, and explicit algebraic expressions are given, which are of practical use for the polarized line transfer computations. In chapter 9, we solve the polarized radiative transfer equation numerically, taking into account both the Zeeman absorption matrix and the Hanle-Zeeman redistribution matrix. We compute the line profiles for arbitrary field strengths, and scattering dominated line transitions. We use a perturbation method (see eg. Nagendra et al. 2002) to solve the Hanle-Zeeman line transfer problem. The limiting cases of weak field Hanle scattering and strong field Zeeman true absorption are retrieved. The ilntermediate regime, where both Zeeman absorption and scattering effects are important, is studied in some detail. Numerical method used to solve the Hanle-Zeeman line transfer problem in Chapter 9 is computationally expensive. Hence it is necessary to develop fast iterative methods like PALI (Polarized Approximate Lambda Iteration). As a first step in this direction we develop such a method in Chapter 10 to solve the transfer problem with weak field Hanle scattering. We use a ‘redistribution matrix’ with coupling between frequency redistribution and polarization and no domain decomposition. Such a matrix is constructed by angle-averaging the frequency dependent terms in the exact weak field Hanle redistribution matrix for a two-level atom with unpolarized ground level (that can be obtained by taking the weak field limit of the Hanle-Zeeman redistribution matrix). In the past, the PALI technique has been applied to redistribution matrices in which frequency redistribution is ‘decoupled’ from scattering <b>polarization,</b> the <b>decoupling</b> being achieved by an adequate decomposition of the frequency space into several domains. In this chapter, we examine the consequences of frequency space decomposition, and the resulting decoupling between the frequency redistribution and polarization, on the solution of the polarized transfer equation for the Stokes parameters...|$|R
