5|$|Differentiation and {{integration}} of <b>power</b> <b>series</b> can be performed term by term and is hence particularly easy.|$|E
5|$|In other areas, such as formal analysis, {{it is more}} {{convenient}} to work directly with the <b>power</b> <b>series</b> themselves. Thus one may define a solution of a differential equation as a <b>power</b> <b>series</b> which, one hopes to prove, is the Taylor series of the desired solution.|$|E
5|$|Algebraic {{operations}} {{can be done}} readily on the <b>power</b> <b>series</b> representation; for instance, Euler's formula {{follows from}} Taylor series expansions for trigonometric and exponential functions. This result is of fundamental importance in such fields as harmonic analysis.|$|E

5|$|Newton is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions {{to the theory of}} finite differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler's summation formula) and was the first to use <b>power</b> <b>series</b> with confidence and to revert <b>power</b> <b>series.</b> Newton's work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin's decimals.|$|E
5|$|A phase-to-amplitude {{converter}} (PAC), {{which uses}} the phase accumulator output word (phase word) usually as an index into a waveform look-up table (LUT) {{to provide a}} corresponding amplitude sample. Sometimes interpolation is used with the look-up table to provide better accuracy and reduce phase error noise. Other methods of converting phase to amplitude, including mathematical algorithms such as <b>power</b> <b>series</b> can be used, particularly in a software NCO.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{calculation}} of Taylor series {{of a large number}} of functions. One can attempt to use the definition of the Taylor series, though this often requires generalizing the form of the coefficients according to a readily apparent pattern. Alternatively, one can use manipulations such as substitution, multiplication or division, addition or subtraction of standard Taylor series to construct the Taylor series of a function, by virtue of Taylor series being <b>power</b> <b>series.</b> In some cases, one can also derive the Taylor series by repeatedly applying integration by parts. Particularly convenient is the use of computer algebra systems to calculate Taylor series.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} a character named Jason who follows his pet frog Fred down {{a hole in}} the earth. There he finds a tank and uses it to battle radioactive mutants. The player controls Jason and the tank Sophia the 3rd through eight levels of gameplay to find the whereabouts of Fred and to defeat the mutants and their leader, the Plutonium Boss. The game was praised for its smooth play control and level designs, detailed and clean graphics, and music, and it was criticized for its high difficulty level and lack of passwords or save points. The game was novelized by Peter Lerangis, as part of the Worlds of <b>Power</b> <b>series</b> published by Scholastic Books.|$|E
25|$|Formal <b>power</b> <b>series</b> {{are like}} polynomials, but allow {{infinitely}} many non-zero terms to occur, {{so that they}} do not have finite degree. Unlike polynomials they cannot in general be explicitly and fully written down (just like irrational numbers cannot), but the rules for manipulating their terms are the same as for polynomials. Non-formal <b>power</b> <b>series</b> also generalize polynomials, but the multiplication of two <b>power</b> <b>series</b> may not converge.|$|E
