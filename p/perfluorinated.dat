5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like <b>perfluorinated</b> polymers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Perfluorinated</b> {{compounds}} are fluorocarbon derivatives, as {{they are}} closely structurally related to fluorocarbons. However, they also possess new atoms such as nitrogen, iodine, or ionic groups, such as <b>perfluorinated</b> carboxylic acids.|$|E
25|$|Ski wax {{may contain}} {{chemicals}} with potential health affects including <b>perfluorinated</b> chemicals. Levels of <b>perfluorinated</b> carboxylic acids, especially perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), {{have been shown}} to increase in ski wax technicians during the ski season.|$|E
25|$|Plastic {{optical fiber}} used for short {{distance}} communication {{is made from}} PMMA, and <b>perfluorinated</b> PMMA, clad with fluorinated PMMA, in situations where its flexibility and cheaper installation costs outweigh its poor heat tolerance and higher attenuation over glass fiber.|$|E
25|$|HF is a {{reactive}} solvent in {{the electrochemical}} fluorination of organic compounds. In this approach, HF is oxidized {{in the presence}} of a hydrocarbon and the fluorine replaces C–H bonds with C–F bonds. <b>Perfluorinated</b> carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids are produced in this way.|$|E
25|$|PFOA {{contaminates}} every continent. PFOA {{has been}} {{detected in the}} central Pacific Ocean at low parts per quadrillion ranges, and at low parts per trillion levels in coastal waters. Due to the surfactant nature of PFOA, {{it has been found}} to concentrate in the top layers of ocean water. PFOA is detected widely in surface waters, and is present in numerous mammals, fish, and bird species. PFOA is in the blood or vital organs of Atlantic salmon, swordfish, striped mullet, gray seals, common cormorants, Alaskan polar bears, brown pelicans, sea turtles, sea eagles, Midwestern bald eagles, California sea lions and Laysan albatrosses on Sand Island, a wildlife refuge on Midway Atoll, {{in the middle of the}} North Pacific Ocean, about halfway between North America and Asia. However, wildlife has much less PFOA than humans, unlike PFOS and other longer <b>perfluorinated</b> carboxylic acids; in wildlife, PFOA is not as bioaccumulative as longer <b>perfluorinated</b> carboxylic acids.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) ordered {{companies}} {{to examine the}} effects of <b>perfluorinated</b> chemicals after receiving data on the global distribution and toxicity of PFOS. For these reasons, and USEPA pressure, in May 2000, 3M announced the phaseout of the production of PFOA, PFOS, and PFOS-related products—the company's best-selling repellent. 3M stated that they would have made the same decision regardless of USEPA pressure.|$|E
25|$|Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (conjugate base perfluorooctanoate), {{also known}} as C8, is a {{synthetic}} <b>perfluorinated</b> carboxylic acid and fluorosurfactant. One industrial application is as a surfactant in the emulsion polymerization of fluoropolymers. It {{has been used in}} the manufacture of such prominent consumer goods as polytetrafluoroethylene (commercially known as Teflon). PFOA has been manufactured since the 1940s in industrial quantities. It is also formed by the degradation of precursors such as some fluorotelomers.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} contain halogens, especially fluorine. An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several {{of the most widely}} used drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. The beneficial effects arise because the C-F bond is relatively unreactive. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. <b>Perfluorinated</b> alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{product is}} {{oxidized}} by SO3 to form PFOA. Under reaction conditions, telomers form with varying length chains containing an even number of carbon atoms, as products mostly contain {{two to six}} tetrafluoroethylene taxogens. After oxidation, distillation is used to separate PFOA from the other <b>perfluorinated</b> carboxylic acids. The telomerization synthesis of PFOA was pioneered by DuPont, {{and it is not}} well suited to the laboratory. PFOA formed by telomerization is completely linear, in contrast to the mixture of structures formed by ECF.|$|E
25|$|Most {{industrialized nations}} have average PFOA blood serum levels ranging from 2 to 8 parts per billion; the highest {{consumer}} sub-population identified was in Korea—with about 60 parts per billion. In Peru, Vietnam, and Afghanistan blood serum levels {{have been recorded}} to be below one part per billion. In 2003–2004 99.7% of Americans had detectable PFOA in their serum {{with an average of}} about 4 parts per billion, and concentrations of PFOA in US serum have declined by 25% in recent years. Despite a decrease in PFOA, the longer <b>perfluorinated</b> carboxylic acid PFNA is increasing in the blood of US consumers.|$|E
25|$|In July 2011, Lacoste, {{along with}} other major fashion and {{sportswear}} brands including Nike, Adidas and Abercrombie & Fitch, {{was the subject of}} Dirty Laundry, a report by the environmental group Greenpeace. According to the findings of the report, Lacoste was accused of working with suppliers in China which contribute to the pollution of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. Samples taken from one facility belonging to the Youngor Group located on the Yangtze River Delta and another belonging to the Well Dyeing Factory Ltd. located on a tributary of the Pearl River Delta revealed the presence of hazardous and persistent hormone disruptor chemicals, including alkylphenols, <b>perfluorinated</b> compounds and perfluorooctane sulfonate.|$|E
500|$|The term <b>perfluorinated</b> {{compound}} is {{used for}} what would otherwise be a perfluorocarbon {{if not for the}} presence of a functional group, often a carboxylic acid. These compounds share many properties with perfluorocarbons such as stability and hydrophobicity, while the functional group augments their reactivity, enabling them to adhere to surfaces or act as surfactants; Fluorosurfactants, in particular, [...] can lower the surface tension of water more than their hydrocarbon-based analogues. Fluorotelomers, which have some unfluorinated carbon atoms near the functional group, are also regarded as <b>perfluorinated.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Humans {{are exposed}} to <b>perfluorinated</b> {{compounds}} (PFCs) in many commercial products. [...] Men contaminated with PFCs in whole blood or seminal plasma have spermatozoa with increased levels of DNA fragmentation and chromosomal aneuploidies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{equation}} above {{shows the}} multiple products of ECF. The target product, F(CF2)7COF (not represented) is produced as only 10–15% {{of the total}} product, while the main products are <b>perfluorinated</b> cyclic ether isomers, including FC-75. To yield PFOA, the <b>perfluorinated</b> acid fluoride is hydrolyzed. The PFOA formed by this method {{is a mixture of}} straight chain (78%), terminally branched (13%), and internally branched (9%) molecules, as ECF rearranges the carbon [...] "tail" [...] of the acid chloride. ECF also results in production wastes. 3M synthesized ECF PFOA at their Cottage Grove, MN facility from 1947 to 2002 and was the world's largest producer. ECF production continues on a smaller scale in Europe and Asia.|$|E
2500|$|Fuel {{delivery}} truck crashes at Otis Rotary have caused fires, treated with fire fighting foam, which has seeped into the groundwater and contaminated drinking water with <b>perfluorinated</b> organic compounds (PFC's).

2500|$|Exposure {{of males}} to certain lifestyle, {{environmental}} and/or occupational hazards {{may increase the}} risk of aneuploid spermatozoa. [...] In particular, risk of aneuploidy is increased by tobacco smoking, and occupational exposure to benzene, insecticides, [...] and <b>perfluorinated</b> compounds. [...] Increased aneuploidy is often associated with increased DNA damage in spermatozoa.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began {{investigating}} <b>perfluorinated</b> chemicals {{after receiving}} {{data on the}} global distribution and toxicity of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). 3M, the former primary producer of PFOS from the U.S., announced the phase-out of PFOS, perfluorooctanoic acid, and PFOS-related product production in May 2000. <b>Perfluorinated</b> compounds produced by 3M were used in non-stick cookware and stain-resistant fabrics. The Cottage Grove facility manufactured PFCs from the 1940s to 2002. In response to PFC contamination of the Mississippi River and surrounding area, 3M stated the area will be [...] "cleaned {{through a combination of}} groundwater pump-out wells and soil sediment excavation". The restoration plan was based on an analysis of the company property and surrounding lands. The on-site water treatment facility that handled the plant's post-production water was not capable of removing the PFCs, which were released into the nearby Mississippi River. The clean-up cost estimate was $50 to $56 million, funded from a $147 million environmental reserve set aside in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of organofluorine compounds can be distinctive. [...] As shown below, <b>perfluorinated</b> aliphatic compounds tend to segregate from hydrocarbons. [...] This [...] "like dissolves like effect" [...] {{is related to}} the usefulness of fluorous phases and the use of PFOA in processing of fluoropolymers. [...] In contrast to the aliphatic derivatives, perfluoroaromatic derivatives tend to form mixed phases with nonfluorinated aromatic compounds, resulting from donor-acceptor interactions between the pi-systems.|$|E
2500|$|Exposure {{of males}} to certain lifestyle, {{environmental}} or occupational hazards {{may increase the}} risk of aneuploid spermatozoa. [...] In particular, risk of aneuploidy is increased by tobacco smoking, and occupational exposure to benzene, insecticides, and <b>perfluorinated</b> compounds. [...] Increased aneuploidy of spermatozoa often occurs in association with increased DNA damage. DNA fragmentation and increased in situ DNA susceptibility to denaturation, the features similar to these seen during apoptosis of somatic cells, characterize abnormal spermatozoa in cases of male infertility.|$|E
2500|$|The carbon-fluorine bond is {{commonly}} found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals because it is generally metabolically stable and fluorine acts as a bioisostere of the hydrogen atom. [...] An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole.

2500|$|PFOA has {{widespread}} applications. In 1976, PFOA {{was reported}} as a water and oil repellent [...] "in fabrics and leather {{and in the}} production of floor waxes and waxed papers"; however, it is believed that paper is no longer treated with <b>perfluorinated</b> compounds, but with fluorotelomers with less than 0.1% PFOA. The compound is also used in [...] "insulators for electric wires, planar etching of fused silica", fire fighting foam, and outdoor clothing. As a protonated species, the acid form of PFOA was the most widely used perfluorocarboxylic acid used as a reactive intermediate {{in the production of}} fluoroacrylic esters.|$|E
2500|$|A USEPA review notes PFOA has not [...] "been {{shown to}} be {{mutagenic}} {{in a variety of}} assays". PFOA {{has been described as a}} member of a group of [...] "classic non-genotoxic carcinogens". However, a provisional German assessment notes that a 2005 study found PFOA to be genotoxic via a peroxisome proliferation pathway that produced oxygen radicals in HepG2 cells, and a 2006 study demonstrated the induction and suppression of a broad range of genes; therefore, it states that the indirect genotoxic (and thus carcinogenic) potential of PFOA cannot be dismissed. Criteria have been proposed that would allow PFOA, and other <b>perfluorinated</b> compounds, to be classified as [...] "weakly non-specific genotoxic".|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Eielson tested {{waters and}} soils for <b>perfluorinated</b> {{compounds}} around areas where [...] "Aqueous Film Forming Foam" [...] {{had been used}} for firefighting and training. In March 2015, the base changed its source of drinking water, because contamination had been found. In April 2015, wells near Moose Creek, Alaska, the community to the north, were tested and found contaminated. In July 2015, water from 132 Moose Creek wells, which serve more than 200 residences, was found to contain perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) above the health advisory level of 0.2 micrograms per liter by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The highest reading in Moose Creek was 2.09 micrograms per liter, and the highest level on Eielson reached 2,000 micrograms per liter {{at the site of}} a KC-135 aircraft fire in 1989. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation [...] said [...] "contamination stretches 6.5 miles from the south of Eielson's runway to the north of Moose Creek and is found up to 100 feet deep". [...] the extent of contamination was unknown and if there was one large plume or multiple small ones. The Air Force has held meetings to discuss the type of water filtration systems for affected homes. , between 145 and 150 homes had well water with PFOS above the EPA health advisory concentrations; with EPA's national water quality standard announced in May 2016, 15 more homes in the Moose Creek community were added.|$|E
