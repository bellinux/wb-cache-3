5|$|Two-page book embeddings with a fixed {{partition}} of the edges into pages {{can be interpreted}} as a form of clustered <b>planarity,</b> in which the given graph must be drawn {{in such a way that}} parts of the graph (the two subsets of edges) are placed in the drawing in a way that reflects their clustering. Two-page book embedding has also been used to find simultaneous embeddings of graphs, in which two graphs are given on the same vertex set and one must find a placement for the vertices in which both graphs are drawn planarly with straight edges.|$|E

25|$|In finite graphs, {{although}} {{depth-first search}} itself is inherently sequential, Trémaux trees {{can be constructed}} by a randomized parallel algorithm in the complexity class RNC. They {{can be used to}} define the tree-depth of a graph, and as part of the left-right <b>planarity</b> test for testing whether a graph is a planar graph.|$|E
25|$|In practice, it is {{difficult}} to use Kuratowski's criterion to quickly decide whether a given graph is planar. However, there exist fast algorithms for this problem: for a graph with n vertices, it is possible to determine in time O(n) (linear time) whether the graph may be planar or not (see <b>planarity</b> testing).|$|E
25|$|The meshedness {{coefficient}} of a planar graph normalizes its number of bounded faces (the {{same as the}} circuit rank of the graph, by Mac Lane's <b>planarity</b> criterion) by dividing it by 2n5, the maximum possible number of bounded faces in a planar graph with n vertices. Thus, it ranges from 0 for trees to 1 for maximal planar graphs.|$|E
25|$|Trémaux trees {{also play}} a key role in the Fraysseix–Rosenstiehl <b>planarity</b> {{criterion}} for testing whether a given graph is planar. According to this criterion, a graph G is planar if, for a given Trémaux tree T of G, the remaining edges can be placed in a consistent way to the left or the right of the tree, subject to constraints that prevent edges with the same placement from crossing each other.|$|E
25|$|For {{parameterized}} {{problems that}} admit a kernelization that preserves <b>planarity</b> {{and reduces the}} input graph to a kernel of size linear in the input parameter, this approach {{can be used to}} design fixed-parameter tractable algorithms the running time of which depends polynomially {{on the size of the}} input graph and exponentially on √k, where k is the parameter of the algorithm. For instance, time bounds of this form are known for finding vertex covers and dominating sets of size k.|$|E
25|$|For example, the planar graphs {{are closed}} under taking minors: {{contracting}} {{an edge in}} a planar graph, or removing edges or vertices from the graph, cannot destroy its <b>planarity.</b> Therefore, the planar graphs have a forbidden minor characterization, {{which in this case}} is given by Wagner's theorem: the set H of minor-minimal nonplanar graphs contains exactly two graphs, the complete graph K5 and the complete bipartite graph K3,3, and the planar graphs are exactly the graphs that do not have a minor in the set {K5,K3,3}.|$|E
25|$|The first β-sheet {{structure}} was proposed by William Astbury in the 1930s. He proposed {{the idea of}} hydrogen bonding between the peptide bonds of parallel or antiparallel extended β-strands. However, Astbury {{did not have the}} necessary data on the bond geometry of the amino acids in order to build accurate models, especially since he did not then know that the peptide bond was planar. A refined version was proposed by Linus Pauling and Robert Corey in 1951. Their model incorporated the <b>planarity</b> of the peptide bond which they previously explained as resulting from keto-enol tautomerization.|$|E
25|$|Apex graphs {{are closed}} under the {{operation}} of taking minors: contracting any edge, or removing any edge or vertex, leads to another apex graph. For, if G is an apex graph with apex v, then any contraction or removal that does not involve v preserves the <b>planarity</b> of the remaining graph, as does any edge removal of an edge incident to v. If an edge incident to v is contracted, {{the effect on the}} remaining graph is equivalent to the removal of the other endpoint of the edge. And if v itself is removed, any other vertex may be chosen as the apex.|$|E
25|$|One {{direction}} of Steinitz's theorem (the easier direction to prove) {{states that the}} graph of every convex polyhedron is planar and 3-connected. As shown in the illustration, <b>planarity</b> can be shown by using a Schlegel diagram: if one places a light source near one face of the polyhedron, and a plane on the other side, {{the shadows of the}} polyhedron edges will form a planar graph, embedded {{in such a way that}} the edges are straight line segments. The 3-connectivity of a polyhedral graph is a special case of Balinski's theorem that the graph of any k-dimensional convex polytope is k-connected.|$|E
25|$|Apollonian {{networks}} {{are examples of}} maximal planar graphs, graphs to which no additional edges can be added without destroying <b>planarity,</b> or equivalently graphs that can be drawn in the plane so that every face (including the outer face) is a triangle. They are also chordal graphs, graphs in which every cycle of four or more vertices has a diagonal edge connecting two non-consecutive cycle vertices, and {{the order in which}} vertices are added in the subdivision process that forms an Apollonian network is an elimination ordering as a chordal graph. This forms an alternative characterization of the Apollonian networks: they are exactly the chordal maximal planar graphs or equivalently the chordal polyhedral graphs.|$|E
25|$|Mac Lane's <b>planarity</b> criterion, {{named after}} Saunders Mac Lane, characterizes planar graphs {{in terms of}} their cycle spaces and cycle bases. It states that a finite undirected graph is planar if and only if the graph has a cycle basis in which each edge of the graph participates in at most two basis cycles. In a planar graph, a cycle basis formed by the set of bounded faces of an {{embedding}} necessarily has this property: each edge participates only in the basis cycles for the two faces it separates. Conversely, if a cycle basis has at most two cycles per edge, then its cycles can be used as the set of bounded faces of a planar embedding of its graph.|$|E
25|$|One modern {{approach}} {{is based on}} the theory of abstract polyhedra. These can be defined as partially ordered sets whose elements are the vertices, edges, and faces of a polyhedron. A vertex or edge element is less than an edge or face element (in this partial order) when the vertex or edge is part of the edge or face. Additionally, one may include a special bottom element of this partial order (representing the empty set) and a top element representing the whole polyhedron. If the sections of the partial order between elements three levels apart (that is, between each face and the bottom element, and between the top element and each vertex) have the same structure as the abstract representation of a polygon, then these partially ordered sets carry exactly the same information as a topological polyhedron. However, these requirements are often relaxed, to instead require only that sections between elements two levels apart have the same structure as the abstract representation of a line segment. (This means that each edge contains two vertices and belongs to two faces, and that each vertex on a face belongs to two edges of that face.) Geometric polyhedra, defined in other ways, can be described abstractly in this way, but it is also possible to use abstract polyhedra as the basis of a definition of geometric polyhedra. A realization of an abstract polyhedron is generally taken to be a mapping from the vertices of the abstract polyhedron to geometric points, such that the points of each face are coplanar. A geometric polyhedron can then be defined as a realization of an abstract polyhedron. Realizations that forgo the requirement of <b>planarity,</b> that impose additional requirements of symmetry, or that map the vertices to higher dimensional spaces have also been considered. Unlike the solid-based and surface-based definitions, this works perfectly well for star polyhedra. However, without additional restrictions, this definition allows degenerate or unfaithful polyhedra (for instance, by mapping all vertices to a single point) and {{the question of how to}} constrain realizations to avoid these degeneracies has not been settled.|$|E
500|$|An {{algebraic}} dual of a {{connected graph}} [...] is a graph [...] such that [...] and [...] {{have the same}} set of edges, any cycle of [...] is a cut of , and any cut of [...] is a cycle of [...] Every planar graph has an algebraic dual, which is in general not unique (any dual defined by a plane embedding will do).

500|$|The same fact can be {{expressed}} {{in the theory of}} matroids. If [...] is the graphic matroid of a graph , then a graph [...] is an algebraic dual of [...] if and only if the graphic matroid of [...] is the dual matroid of [...] Then Whitney's <b>planarity</b> criterion can be rephrased as stating that the dual matroid of a graphic matroid [...] is itself a graphic matroid if and only if the underlying graph [...] of [...] is planar. If [...] is planar, the dual matroid is the graphic matroid of the dual graph of [...] In particular, all dual graphs, for all the different planar embeddings of , have isomorphic graphic matroids.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the spine}} {{ordering}} {{is known in}} advance for this application, testing {{for the existence of}} a bi-secondary structure for a given basepairing is straightforward. The problem of assigning edges to the two pages in a compatible way can be formulated as either an instance of 2-satisfiability, or as a problem of testing the bipartiteness of the circle graph whose vertices are the basepairs and whose edges describe crossings between basepairs. Alternatively and more efficiently, as [...] show, a bi-secondary structure exists if and only if the diagram graph of the input (a graph formed by connecting the bases into a cycle in their sequence order and adding the given basepairs as edges) is a planar graph. This characterization allows bi-secondary structures to be recognized in linear time as an instance of <b>planarity</b> testing.|$|E
500|$|Every two-page book {{embedding}} is {{a special}} case of a planar embedding, because the union of two pages of a book is a space topologically equivalent to the whole plane. Therefore, every graph with book thickness two is automatically a planar graph. More precisely, the book thickness of a graph [...] is at most two {{if and only if}} [...] is a subgraph of a planar graph that has a Hamiltonian cycle. If a graph is given a two-page embedding, it can be augmented to a planar Hamiltonian graph by adding (into any page) extra edges between any two consecutive vertices along the spine that are not already adjacent, and between the first and last spine vertices. The Goldner–Harary graph provides an example of a planar graph that does not have book thickness two: it is a maximal planar graph, so {{it is not possible to}} add any edges to it while preserving <b>planarity,</b> and it does not have a Hamiltonian cycle. Because of this characterization by Hamiltonian cycles, graphs that have two-page book embeddings are also known as subhamiltonian graphs.|$|E
500|$|If an {{ordering}} of the vertices of a graph along {{the spine of}} an embedding is fixed, then a two-page embedding (if it exists) {{can be found in}} linear time, as an instance of <b>planarity</b> testing for a graph formed by augmenting the given graph with a cycle connecting the vertices in their spine ordering. [...] claimed that finding three-page embeddings with a fixed spine ordering can also be performed in polynomial time although his writeup of this result omits many details. However, for graphs that require four or more pages, the problem of finding an embedding with the minimum possible number of pages remains NP-hard, via an equivalence to the NP-hard problem of coloring circle graphs, the intersection graphs of chords of a circle. Given a graph [...] with a fixed spine ordering for its vertices, drawing these vertices in the same order around a circle and drawing the edges of [...] as line segments produces a collection of chords representing [...] One can then form a circle graph that has the chords of this diagram as vertices and crossing pairs of chords as edges. A coloring of the circle graph represents a partition of the edges of [...] into subsets that can be drawn without crossing on a single page. Therefore, an optimal coloring is equivalent to an optimal book embedding. Since circle graph coloring with four or more colors is NP-hard, and since any circle graph can be formed in this way from some book embedding problem, it follows that optimal book embedding is also NP-hard. For a fixed vertex ordering on the spine of a two-page book drawing, it is also NP-hard to minimize the number of crossings when this number is nonzero.|$|E

2500|$|Planar {{monocyclic}} {{molecules containing}} 4n π-electrons are called antiaromatic and are, in general, unstable. [...] Molecules {{that could be}} antiaromatic will tend to change from this electronic or conformation, thereby becoming non-aromatic. [...] For example, cyclooctatetraene (COT) distorts out of <b>planarity,</b> breaking π overlap between adjacent double bonds. Recent studies have determined that cyclobutadiene adopts an asymmetric, rectangular configuration in which single and double bonds indeed alternate, with no resonance; the single bonds are markedly longer than the double bonds, reducing unfavorable p-orbital overlap. This reduction of symmetry lifts the degeneracy of the two formerly non-bonding molecular orbitals, which by Hund's rule forces the two unpaired electrons into a new, weakly bonding orbital (and also creates a weakly antibonding orbital). Hence, cyclobutadiene is non-aromatic; the strain of the asymmetric configuration outweighs the anti-aromatic destabilization that would afflict the symmetric, square configuration.|$|E
