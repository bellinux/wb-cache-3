40|$|AbstractBackgroundExternal {{catheters}} (ECs) {{are commonly}} used in children who are receiving treatment for acute leukemia. AimsTo study the spectrum of microorganisms and to compare the rates of infection. MethodsA total of 42 ECs were inserted, including 28 <b>Port-A-Caths,</b> 11 CVC lines and 3 Hickman lines. Single ECs were required for 19 patients (45. 2 %), whereas 2, 3 and 4 ECs were required in 8, 1 and 1 patients, respectively. ResultsOverall, 37 culture-documented infections were present in 18 (62 %) patients who had ECs. Gram-positive microorganisms were identified in 20 cases, Gram-negative microorganisms in 14 cases and fungal infections in 3 cases. Of the 42 devices implanted, 10 out of 28 <b>Port-A-Caths</b> (35. 7 %), 2 out of 3 Hickman catheters (66. 7 %) and 9 out of 11 central venous catheters (81. 8 %) required removal due to infection. The average length of working life for the ports was 330. 6 days (range: 40 – 1043 days). The median rate of complications due to infection was 2. 84 infections per 1000 catheter days (interquartile range: − 1. 55 to 5. 8), {{and the number of}} infections was correlated with the number of ports (Pearson's r= 0. 51; p< 0. 05) ...|$|R

Thirty-four of 144 patients not accepted for outpatient intravenous therapy, were screened by the Infectious Disease Service and Pharmacy, and were discharged on oral antibiotics. Peripherally inserted central catheters were employed in 61 of 107 (57 %) patients, peripheral short catheters in 20 (19 %), Hickman lines in 14 (13 %), and <b>Port-a-caths</b> in 12 (12 %).

40|$|Purpose The use of {{intravascular}} devices {{is associated}} with a number of potential complications. Despite a number of evidence-based clinical guidelines in this area, there continues to be nursing practice discrepancies. This study aims to examine nursing practice in a cancer care setting to identify nursing practice and areas for improvement respective to best available evidence. Methods A point prevalence survey was undertaken in a tertiary cancer care centre in Queensland, Australia. On a randomly selected day, four nurses assessed intravascular device related nursing practices and collected data using a standardized survey tool. Results 58 inpatients (100 %) were assessed. Forty-eight (83 %) had a device in situ, comprising 14 Peripheral Intravenous Catheters (29. 2 %), 14 Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (29. 2 %), 14 Hickman catheters (29. 2 %) and six <b>Port-a-Caths</b> (12. 4 %). Suboptimal outcomes such as incidences of local site complications, incorrect/inadequate documentation, lack of flushing orders, and unclean/non intact dressings were observed. Conclusions This study has highlighted a number of intravascular device related nursing practice discrepancies compared with current hospital policy. Education and other implementation strategies can be applied to improve nursing practice. Following education strategies, it will be valuable to repeat this survey on a regular basis to provide feedback to nursing staff and implement strategies to improve practice. More research is required to provide evidence to clinical practice with regards to intravascular device related consumables, flushing technique and protocols. Full Tex...|$|R
2500|$|Genericization or [...] "loss of {{secondary}} meaning" [...] may be either {{among the general}} population or among just a subpopulation, for example, {{people who work in}} a particular industry.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: The {{success of}} home {{parenteral}} nutrition (HPN) programs is compromised by complications of central venous catheters (CVCs), such as occlusions and bloodstream infections. We performed {{a retrospective analysis}} of complication rates of arteriovenous fistulae versus CVCs in patients on long-term HPN. METHODS: Data were collected from 127 consecutive patients who received HPN between January 2000 and October 2006, comprising 344 access years of CVCs and 194 access years of arteriovenous fistulae. We evaluated access-related bloodstream infection and occlusion incidence rates (number of complications per access year) using Poisson-normal regression analysis. Complication incidence rate ratios were calculated by dividing complication incidence rates of CVCs by those of arteriovenous fistulae, adjusting for HPN frequency, medication use, infusion fluid composition, and underlying diseases. RESULTS: Bloodstream infection incidence rates were 0. 03 /year for arteriovenous fistulae, 1. 37 /year for long-term CVCs (<b>Port-a-Caths</b> and tunneled catheters), and 3. 12 /year for short-term CVCs (nontunneled catheters). Occlusion incidence rates were 0. 60 /year for arteriovenous fistulae, 0. 35 /year for long-term CVCs, and 0. 93 /year for shortterm CVCs. Adjusted incidence rate ratios of long-term CVCs over arteriovenous fistulae were 47 (95 % confidence interval, 19 - 117) for bloodstream infections and 0. 53 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 31 - 0. 89) for occlusions. CONCLUSIONS: The occlusion incidence rate was higher for arteriovenous fistulae than for certain types of CVCs. The incidence rate {{of the most serious}} access-related complication (bloodstream infections) was much lower for arteriovenous fistulae than for all types of CVCs. Thus, arteriovenous fistulae are safe and valuable alternatives to CVCs for patients requiring long-term HPN...|$|R
40|$|The {{hallmark}} of severe haemophilia, {{defined as a}} circulating level of factor (F) VIII (haemophilia A cases) or FIX (haemophilia B cases) of < 1 %, is recurrent bleeding into muscles and joints (haemarthroses) {{from an early age}} of life. The inevitable result of such bleeding is progressive joint damage, leading to disabling arthritis that is typically evident within the first 2 decades of life in people with haemophilia who have limited or no access to regular factor replacement therapy, or those in whom factor replacement therapy is ineffective {{because of the presence of}} high-titre inhibitors. For children with severe haemophilia and no evidence of inhibitors, the unwanted musculoskeletal complications of severe haemophilia can be effectively prevented by the early initiation of a programme of long-term factor prophylaxis. In order to achieve the best outcome (a perfect musculoskeletal status for age) the programme of prophylaxis should be started before the onset of joint damage (primary prophylaxis). The gold standard primary prophylaxis regimen (the Malmo protocol) was pioneered and tested in Sweden and involves the infusion of 20 - 40 IU of FVIII per kg body weight on alternate days (minimum three times per week) for haemophilia A cases, and 20 - 40 IU kg(- 1) of FIX twice weekly for haemophilia B cases. This protocol is, however, demanding on peripheral veins and very expensive. Modifications of the parent protocol such as starting primary prophylaxis with once-weekly infusions via peripheral veins with rapid escalation to full-dose prophylaxis or dose escalation based on frequency of bleeding are increasingly implemented in haemophilia treatment centres in countries that can afford the high cost of such programmes. These modified programmes can be achieved in the majority of young children with severe haemophilia without the need for central venous access devices (e. g. <b>Port-a-Caths)</b> and with avoidance of device-associated complications such as infection and thrombosis. In at least one centre, experience with arteriovenous fistulae as a strategy to ensure reliable venous access is being accumulated. The issues of compliance (adherence) to recommended prophylaxis protocols and when, if ever, to stop a programme of primary prophylaxis once started are real and require ongoing prospective studies. Such studies should incorporate outcome measures such as health-related quality-of-life and economic analyses...|$|R

The other three patients showed complete normalization of their bilirubin levels and their <b>port-a-cath</b> systems remained open until their death (at 3 weeks, 6 months and 7 months respectively).

40|$|See page 256 for the diagnosis. Figure 1 : Left: A {{radiograph}} of {{the chest}} of a 75 -year-old woman with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma taken 3 weeks before a red blood cell transfusion. The tip of a <b>Port-a-Cath</b> is indicated by the arrow. Opacities in the upper left and lower right lung can also be seen. Right: A chest radiograph showing mediastinal widening. This radiograph was obtained 1 hour after the transfusion was stopped be-cause of dyspnea and retrosternal dull chest pain {{with a feeling of}} heaviness. A 75 -year-old woman with stageIV lung adenocarcinoma wasadmitted to our hospital to re-ceive chemotherapy and a transfusion because of anemia. One unit of packed red blood cells was transfused via a pressure infusor into a <b>Port-a-Cath,</b> which had been implanted in the left side of her chest wall 2 years before. Within 1 hour of the start of the transfu-sion, the patient complained of dyspnea and retrosternal dull chest pain with...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of hepatic vein occlusion by stent-graft used in transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The experiments were performed in six healthy pigs under general anesthesia. Following percutaneous transhepatic implantation of a <b>port-a-cath</b> in the right hepatic vein, TIPS was created with a stent-graft (Viatorr; W L Gore, Flagstaff, AZ, USA). The outflow from the hepatic vein, blocked by the stent-graft was documented by injection of contrast medium and repeated injections of 99 Tc m -labeled human serum albumin through the <b>port-a-cath.</b> After 2 weeks, the outflow was re-evaluated, the pigs were sacrificed, and histopathologic examination of the liver was performed. Occlusion of the hepatic vein by a stent-graft had a short and temporary effect on the outflow. Histopathological examination from the affected liver segment showed no divergent pattern. Stent-grafts used in TIPS block the outflow from the liver vein, but do not have a prolonged circulatory effect and do not affect the liver parenchyma...|$|E
40|$|<b>Port-a-cath</b> is {{a widely}} used device in {{patients}} with long-term venous access demand such as frequent or continuous administration of medications such as Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), chemotherapy delivery, blood transfusions, blood products, and fluids. Patients with Lysosomal Storage Diseases (LSDs) often require recurrent courses of ERT. We reviewed our experience of using port-a-caths in patients with LSDs with the focus on challenges and complications associated with these catheters. Among 245 adult patients who were treated with ERT, twenty patients (8. 2 %) had a <b>port-a-cath</b> inserted due to poor venous access. Six patients were using their first port whereas five other patients had their port-a-caths replaced at least once. The remaining six patients had inactive port-a-caths. The majority of patients with active port-a-caths never missed more than one consecutive infusion, although one patient missed 2 consecutive infusions whilst on holiday. We identified significant gaps in patients' and their families' understanding of the management of port-a-caths and risks associated with them. It resulted in producing a leaflet and designing an educational program for our LSD patients...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Totally implantable central venous accesses (<b>port-a-cath)</b> {{are often}} used for {{chemotherapy}} administration or prolonged intravenous infusions in cancer patients. Local and systemic complications may occur both during and after placement of <b>port-a-cath</b> despite the well-established techniques for its placement and care. Out of other catheter-related local complications, thrombosis and infections represent the most common. Complications related to central venous catheter {{may be associated with}} infusion of both conventional chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapy. Incidence and nature of complications of central venous catheter have been well established for long-term chemotherapy. However, very sparse data exists on the incidence of complications of molecularly targeted therapies administered through a central venous catheter. Hence, we decided to retrospectively analyze the local complications of a central venous catheter in patients receiving molecularly targeted therapy and conventional chemotherapy, respectively. METHODS: Over a 2 -year period, 459 devices were placed in two academic Italian institutions. Patients' characteristics, catheter-related complications, and their relationship with targeted therapy administration were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS: Catheter-related complications occurred in 30 out of the 459 analyzed cancer patients (7...|$|E
