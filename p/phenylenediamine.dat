5000|$|... 2,5-Diaminotoluene is a {{substitute}} for <b>phenylenediamine</b> (1,4-diaminobenzene) in commercial hair dyes. It is preferred because of its lower toxicity. However, many home hair dyes still use <b>phenylenediamine.</b> In these applications, these diamines function as a primary intermediate, which means that it is first oxidized with hydrogen peroxide and then combined with a coupler to form the hair dye. [...] 2,5-Diaminotoluene is commonly used to produce black, drab and warm browns, and shades of blonde and gray hair dyes.|$|E

5000|$|... 2-Nitroaniline is {{the main}} {{precursor}} to <b>phenylenediamines,</b> which are converted to benzimidazoles, a family of heterocycles that are key components in pharmaceuticals.|$|R

50|$|Because a {{range of}} amines can be {{condensed}} with the dianhydride. For example, two useful pigments of the perinone class are generated by condensation with <b>phenylenediamine.</b> A variety of ligands with NDI backbones have also been prepared.|$|E
50|$|In {{coordination}} chemistry, <b>phenylenediamine</b> is {{an important}} ligand precursor. Schiff base derivatives, such as those derived from salicylaldehyde, are excellent chelating ligands. Oxidation of its metal-phenylenediamine complexes affords the diimine derivatives, which are intensely colored and often exist in multiple stable oxidation states.|$|E
50|$|Wurster's blue is the {{trivial name}} {{given to the}} {{chemical}} N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, also known as TMPD. It is an easily oxidised <b>phenylenediamine,</b> which loses two electrons in one-electron oxidation steps; the radical cation is a characteristic blue-violet colour, which gives the compound part of its name. The remaining part of its name comes from its discoverer, the German chemist Casimir Wurster (7 August 1854 - 29 November 1913).|$|E
30|$|As aryldiamines, PPD, PTD, {{and their}} {{transformation}} products are of toxicological and environmental concern. They are assessed as toxic [8], mutagenic in vitro [9], and carcinogenic [9 – 11]. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has categorized various <b>phenylenediamines</b> as human carcinogens [12]. In the year 2012, the “Permanent Senate Commission for the Investigation of Health Hazards of Chemical Compounds in the Work Area” of the German Research Foundation (DFG) has assessed PPD as a carcinogenic occupational substance (category 3 B) [13]. A specific feature of <b>phenylenediamines,</b> especially of PPD, is their allergic potential [14, 15]. PPD {{is known as}} the most important allergen associated with hair dye-related allergic contact dermatitis [16, 17]. It is a pre- or pro-hapten and converted into several haptens by various (aut)oxidative reactions. With respect to occupational health and consumer health requirements, the usage of PPD and PTD in hair and tattoo dye formulations is subject to various regulations. The European Economic Community Cosmetics Directive has set limit values for the maximal concentration of <b>phenylenediamines</b> in hair dyes to 6  % (PPD) and 10  % (PTD), provided that the active dye formulation contains an excess of coupling compounds [18]. The toxicological potential of technical and commercial formulations of aryldiamines is not only coined by the pure compounds themselves but also by side products of their technical synthesis and by chemical (aut)oxidation products formed during post production handling, product formulation, storage, application, or environmental exposure [19]. In contact with air or oxidizing agents like peroxides, <b>phenylenediamines</b> are easily transformed into complex mixtures of monomeric, dimeric, oligomeric, and polymeric oxidation products. Furthermore, the amines might undergo photolytic or photooxidative degradation when exposed to sunlight [20, 21]. In properly composed oxidative hair dye formulations, the aryldiamines are efficiently converted into the desired permanent dye by reaction with the coupler component avoiding the formation of toxic byproducts, e.g., Bandrowski’s Base [2, 22]. Nevertheless, even under those conditions, the aryldiamines are not completely scavenged and consumed by the couplers so that a certain reactivity potential might persist. Consequently, henna tattoo coloration formulations containing aryldiamines, e.g., PPD, without a coupler, are of high toxicological concern, since under those conditions, potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds are formed by autoxidation processes of the diaminobenzenes. The current status of the PPD risk assessment is briefly summarized in [23]. Thus, a final evaluation of the toxic properties and environmental behavior of <b>phenylenediamines</b> requires an in-depth knowledge of their transformation products formed under the respective conditions.|$|R

50|$|In this example, {{hydrazine}} converts oxygen, {{a common}} corrosive agent, to water, {{which is generally}} benign. Related inhibitors of oxygen corrosion are hexamine, <b>phenylenediamine,</b> and dimethylethanolamine, and their derivatives. Antioxidants such as sulfite and ascorbic acid are sometimes used. Some corrosion inhibitors form a passivating coating on the surface by chemisorption. Benzotriazole is one such species used to protect copper. For lubrication, zinc dithiophosphates are common - they deposit sulfide on surfaces.The suitability of any given chemical for a task in hand depends on many factors, including their operating temperature.|$|E
50|$|Benzimidazoles {{substituted}} with an alkylamine {{at position}} 2 have a venerable history as H1 antihistaminic agents. The standard starting material for many benzimidazoles consists of <b>phenylenediamine,</b> or its derivatives.Reaction of that compound with chloroacetic acid can be rationalized by invoking initial {{formation of the}} chloromethyl amide. Imide formation with the remaining free amino group closes the ring to afford 2-chloromethyl benzimidazole (3). Displacement of halogen with pyrrolidine affords the alkylation product. The proton on the fused imidazole nitrogen is then removed by reaction with sodium hydride. Treatment of the resulting anion with α,4-dichlorotoluene gives the H1 antihistaminic agent clemizole (5).|$|E
5000|$|... 4&#8209;Hydroxyacetamide (1) is {{alkylated}} with {{n-propyl bromide}} {{in the presence}} of potassium hydroxide to give the ether (2). Nitration of this product with nitric and sulfuric acids proceeds at the position ortho to the amide group (3), which is then reduced with SnCl2 to yield the <b>phenylenediamine</b> derivative (4). Reaction of that intermediate with S-methyl isothiourea proceeds first by aromatic cyclisation to the guanidine derivative followed by elimination of methyl mercaptan to yield the 2-aminobenzimidazole system (5). Acylation with methyl chloroformate results in the formation of a urethane on the amino group to produce oxibendazole (6).|$|E
2500|$|This {{degradation}} can {{be prevented}} through the addition of 5–100 ppm of antioxidants, such as <b>phenylenediamines</b> and other amines. Hydrocarbons with a bromine number of 10 or above can be protected with the combination of unhindered or partially hindered phenols and oil-soluble strong amine bases, such as hindered phenols. [...] "Stale" [...] gasoline can be detected by a colorimetric enzymatic test for organic peroxides produced by oxidation of the gasoline.|$|R
30|$|A visual {{sign of the}} {{reactivity}} of <b>phenylenediamines</b> is the development or change of color of their aqueous, oxygen containing, or air-exposed solutions within a few hours. Within a few hours, the solutions turn dark brown and, subsequently, a black-brown precipitate forms. The formation of the reaction products and thus the transformation of PPD and PTD are pH-dependent and accelerated under alkaline conditions. Stored at 4  °C, aqueous PPD solutions remain stable for more than 24  h [33].|$|R

[...] In the 1661 book Eighteen Books of the Secrets of Art & Nature, various methods of coloring hair black, gold, green, red, yellow, and white are explained. [...] The development of synthetic dyes for hair is traced to the 1860s discovery of the reactivity of para- <b>phenylenediamine</b> (PPD) with air. Eugène Schueller, the founder of L'Oréal, is recognized for creating the first synthetic hair dye in 1907. In 1947 the German cosmetics firm Schwarzkopf launched the first home color product, [...] "Poly Color".

30|$|Notably, {{the use of}} 5  mM <b>phenylenediamine</b> was {{sufficient}} to eliminate the responses to interferents of small concentrations remaining after sample dilution, but deficient to work with undiluted samples. An increase of <b>phenylenediamine</b> concentration to 20  mM and three CVAs {{turned out to be}} sufficient for complete elimination of the cysteine impact and a decrease of responses to ascorbic acid to the lowest level (0.1 % of the response to ascorbic acid without PPD membrane). The use of higher (up to 100  mM) <b>phenylenediamine</b> concentration resulted in twofold decrease of the transducer sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, probably, because of too thick PPD layer. Thus, the deposition of PPD membrane using three CVAs in 30  mM <b>phenylenediamine</b> is an optimal procedure.

Later on, the focus widened to cover toxicological aspects, initially concentrating on the generation of Bandrowski’s Base (BB), a very strong sensitizing agent. Other research aspects also shaped by toxicological concerns are the formation of adducts between aryl(di)amines and amino acids or peptides.|$|R

40|$|The {{carcinogenicity}} of 23 <b>phenylenediamines</b> {{and related}} compounds was reviewed. An extensive {{analysis of the}} methods used indicated that the bioassays were conducted well.

Oxidation of a methyl substituent on nitroaniline to a carboxyl group eliminated all carcinogenic activity. It required dichlorination to make ring-substtuted 1, 4 -phenylenediamine carcinogenic whereas only one chlorine atom was needed to make 1, 2 - and 1, 3 -phenylenediamine carcinogenic. While the available data suggest that as a class, 4 -substituted 1, 3 -phenylenediamines are carcinogenic more often than ring-substituted 1, 4 -phenylenediamines, the type of added substituent and its position on the benzene ring also are important in exerting carcinogenic activity...|$|R

30|$|In this work, {{we studied}} the {{conditions}} of deposition of a semipermeable polyphenylenediamine (PPD)-based membrane on amperometric disk platinum electrodes.

In the density functional framework, the singlet diradical character is discussed within the broken symmetry formalism. The singlet- triplet energy gaps, the energy gained from symmetry breaking, the spin distribution in the lowest triplet state, and {{the form of the}} magnetic orbitals are applied as indicators for the singlet diradical character. Moreover, a new index for the diradical character is proposed that is based on symmetry breaking. All symmetry breaking criteria show that the complexes obtained from o-catecholates and o-benzodithiolates have the largest and the smallest singlet diradical character, respectively. The singlet diradical character should be intermediate for the complexes derived from o- <b>phenylenediamines,</b> o-aminophenolates, and o- aminothiophenolates.
