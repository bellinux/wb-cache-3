40|$|Objectives Population {{modelling}} holds considerable {{promise for}} identifying {{the most efficient}} and cost-effective falls prevention measures, but the outcomes {{need to be in}} a readily useable form. This paper describes an iterative, collaborative process undertaken by researchers and falls prevention <b>policy</b> <b>officers</b> to develop such a format for falls prevention intervention evidence. Methods The researchers developed a draft template that underwent several iterations and improvements, through three collaborative consultations with <b>policy</b> <b>officers.</b> Results Although the researchers initially identified many key information needs, active engagement with <b>policy</b> <b>officers</b> ensured that <b>policy</b> requirements were met and that the value of the reporting formats for policy decision-making was maximised. Importantly, they highlighted the need to articulate underlying modelling assumptions clearly. The resulting formats, with complete data, were given to <b>policy</b> <b>officers</b> to inform their local jurisdictional policy decisions. Conclusions There is strong benefit in researchers and <b>policy</b> <b>officers</b> collaborating to develop optimal formats for presenting scientific evidence to inform policy decisions. Such a process can reduce concerns of researchers that evidence is not incorporated into policy decisions. They also meet policy officers' needs for evidence to be provided in a way that can directly inform their decision-making processes.

2500|$|The {{government}} {{was criticized for}} its decision to tow the ailing wreck out to sea [...] where it split in two [...] rather than in to a port. World Wildlife Fund's senior <b>policy</b> <b>officer</b> for shipping Simon Walmsley believed most of the blame lay with the classification society. [...] "It was reported as being substandard {{at one of the}} ports it visited before Spain. The whole inspection regime needs to be revamped and double-hulled tankers used instead," [...] he says. The US and most other countries are phasing out single-hulled tankers by 2012.|$|E
2500|$|According to Matthew Caruana Galizia, {{death threats}} were almost a daily occurrence. These {{took the form}} of phone calls, letters, notes pinned to the front door, text messages, emails, and {{comments}} on her blog. [...] Caruana Galizia's controversial blog posts also resulted in several protracted legal battles. By the time of her death, she was involved in legal proceedings with twelve persons, in 42 different libel suits. A legal fund was crowdfunded to cover four precautionary warrants - freezing her assets to the tune of €50,000 - for the maximum libel damages possible at law. These were instituted by the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party and Minister for the Economy, Chris Cardona, and his EU presidency <b>policy</b> <b>officer,</b> Joseph Gerada.|$|E

It is now evident that beating global warming will require a radically different model of politics than the one on display here in Copenhagen."

Nnimmo Bassey, of Friends of the Earth international called the conference [...] "an abject failure". Lydia Baker of Save the Children said that world leaders had [...] "effectively signed a death warrant {{for many of the}} world's poorest children. Up to 250,000 children from poor communities could die before the next major meeting in Mexico at the end of next year." [...] Tim Jones, climate <b>policy</b> <b>officer</b> from the World Development Movement said that leaders had [...] "refused to lead and instead sought to bribe and bully developing nations to sign up to the equivalent of a death warrant." ...|$|E

Additionally, the <b>policy</b> <b>officers</b> even can use traffic camera surveillances along the route to measure the point-to-point journey time according to the license plate so as to identify whether the truck driver is fatigued.|$|R

30|$|The {{participants}} {{agreed that}} {{the complexity of the}} innovation system within the governments has often served as a barrier to utilizing a more coordinated approach to activities. According to most of the interviewees, the key challenge in policy support was a lack of vertical communication—collaboration between provincial and federal governments. Provincial <b>policy</b> <b>officers</b> emphasized that stronger coordination with the federal government was needed in terms of data sharing, making decisions on larger capital investments, and collaborating on decisions over broader national priorities.|$|R

30|$|The {{communications}} of the European Commission on the Mobility Partnerships {{have done}} little to demystify what the latter would contain. At the time of its first implementation, the Mobility Partnership still appeared as a nebulous instrument to all participating parties, from the member states to the partner country, and even to the <b>Policy</b> <b>Officers</b> from the European Commission themselves (Interview <b>Policy</b> <b>Officers,</b> DG Home Affairs, 2012 - 2016). A European team of experts is deployed in the partner country to provide recommendations that will, along with the stated priorities of the local authorities, form the content of the Mobility Partnership. In the case of Moldova, the national authorities formulated the return of their nationals and their subsequent economic and social reintegration as their main priorities. For Georgia, the reintegration of their nationals and the management of their borders were stated as the main objectives to be achieved. Both countries’ priorities coincided largely with the interests of the participating member states. The institutional actors in charge of the negotiations of the Mobility Partnership on the Moldovan side admitted being fully conscious that the objectives that landed on their partnership reflected more closely the priorities wanted by the EU, but did not perceive it as an anomaly since it proved their commitment to adhere to EU rules.|$|R
40|$|In 2008, the new Labor Government in Australia has {{introduced}} {{plans for a}} National Curriculum in mathematics, science, history and English in primary and secondary schools to be implemented in 2011 and extended to involve geography and languages other than English in a second phase. The intention {{is to establish a}} standards-referenced framework to "invigorate a national effort to improve student learning in the selected subjects" (National Curriculum Board, 2008 : 3). In 2007 states and territories in Australia developed individual approaches to the use of standards in the implementation of curriculum, assessment and reporting. The latter involves schools to report using A-E grades that is consistent with the Federal government's requirement. This paper reports on a four year Australian Research Council Linkagei project, being conducted in the Australian State of Queensland. The major industry partner for this project is the Queensland Studies Authority (QSA). The intent of such partnerships is for research, conducted by academics in liaison with <b>policy</b> <b>officers,</b> to inform <b>policy</b> development. Too often <b>policy</b> <b>officers</b> have to 'grasp the complex remit quickly and take action' (Saunders, 2005) without the benefits of policy-related research. The findings from this study are being used developmentally to inform and influence the policy environment, particular assessment initiatives and practices...|$|R
