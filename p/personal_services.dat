40|$|Consumersatisfaction is {{fundamental}} to organisational success. It is well recognised that <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> is important in achieving consumer satisfaction. However, the application of self-service technology (SST) is widcning and is attennuating traditional exchanges between consumers and service employees. The effect of this reduction of <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> on consumer satisfaction judgements is not well understood. This study addresses this gap by investigating the relative effects of SST and <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> attributes on overall consumer satisfaction. Thc study highlights important service attributes applicable to SST and <b>personal</b> <b>service.</b> The conceptual framework is tested using data collected from 241 leisure and business travellers drawn from premium hotels in a regional area. Structural equation modelling techniques support the conceptual framework. As expected, the attributes of <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> and SST contribute to consumer satisfaction. However, thc impact of <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> attributes 011 consumer satisfaction is much stronger than the effects of SST attributes. Though SST is an important determinant of consumer satisfaction, interactions with staff are critical. These results have applications for the {{theory and practice of}} services marketing, and high light avenues for further investigation...|$|R

After two years at the MoD, Jackson took command of the 3rd Mechanised Division in April 1994. During the Yugoslav Wars in 1995, Jackson had been due to succeed Rupert Smith as commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), which would have entailed early promotion to lieutenant general (three-star rank) and a blue beret, signifying UN command. As {{a result of the}} Dayton Agreement, however, UNPROFOR became the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR), and Jackson remained a major general (two-star rank), commanding the 3rd Division and troops from several other countries who made up Multinational Division South-West.

5000|$|<b>Personal</b> <b>service</b> is {{service of}} process {{directly}} to the (or a) party named on the summons, complaint, or petition. In most lawsuits in the United States, <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> is required to prove service. Most states allow substituted service in almost all lawsuits unless you are serving a corporation, LLC, LLP, or other business entity; in those cases, <b>personal</b> <b>service</b> must be achieved by serving (in hand) the documents to the [...] "Registered Agent" [...] of a business entity. Some states, e.g. Florida, do not require that the documents actually be handed to the individual. In California and most other states, the documents must be visible to the person being served, i.e., not in a sealed envelope. If the individual refuses to accept service, flees, closes the door, etc., and the individual has been positively identified as the person to be served, the documents may be [...] "drop served" [...] (placed {{as close to the}} individual as possible); this is considered a valid <b>service.</b> <b>Personal</b> <b>service</b> of process has been the hallmark for initiating litigation for nearly 100 years, primarily because it guarantees actual notice to a defendant of a legal action against him or her. <b>Personal</b> <b>service</b> of process remains the most reliable and efficacious way to both ensure compliance with constitutionally imposed due process requirements of notice to a defendant and the opportunity to be heard.|$|R
